Guys, I think I'm gonna be OK!!!

Well, its been almost 48 hours since the last smoke, and since I did have 3 in the first 2 days of this journey, I've been dealing with feelings and what not for 4 days now....but guess what,I'm starting to feel OK!!!

Yesterday I hated everyone and wanted to eat everything. So I let myself do both those things. Today I'm attempting to be a bit more zen and I got myself some fruit to snack on.  But I honestly feel right now like everything's gonna be OK. I still keep having instinctive feelings like "oh i m just gonna go for a smoke and then I'll make that call or do that thing".. And it catches me off guard... Oh wait.. No I'm not.... OK... I'm going to sit here and eat these grapes instead....

I have no cigarettes and I understand purchasing a pack is simply not an option. 
Tomorrow (which will be day 3) I have to go to my parents place, they smoke indoors. Wish me luck... But I think I got this :)

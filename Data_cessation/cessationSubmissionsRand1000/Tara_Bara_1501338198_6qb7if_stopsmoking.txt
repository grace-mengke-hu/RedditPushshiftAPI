I came SO close.

Was literally driving to the gas station, thinking "Fuck it, I'll just quit again tomorrow" (even though yesterday has become tomorrow time and time again...oh and my badge should read 3 days). I was like Jenny on Forrest Gump standing on the ledge of the hotel balcony with Free Bird playing in the background. But I got stopped at a long light and somehow talked myself out of it and turned around. 

It's so scary how much control this thing has over me! I'm not even sure where I found the strength to overcome. It's literally like the healthy part of me is fighting the addict...two separate personalities. Maybe I'm just so sick and tired of my own crap, and THAT is why I was able to tackle my addict. Not sure why I'm posting this. Just hoping someone can relate I guess. 

Thanks

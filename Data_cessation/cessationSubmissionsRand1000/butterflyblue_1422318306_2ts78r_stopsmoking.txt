two weeks and it's only my mind that plays tricks on me.

My husband asked me how I was doing the other day.  I honestly had to think about it because I still wanted to smoke. It's not a physical craving anymore.  I don't feel anxious or on edge like I did the first week. But sometimes while I'm painting or cooking dinner I just think...I want a smoke.  

It's the little things...the triggers.  Every time I go into a gas station I have to remind myself I don't smoke.  I've even gone as far as picking a new gas station further from the house because they know my daily order and on day #2 of quitting they rang it up and I had to tell them I quit.  

I'm having to relearn how to live.  How to drive...how to de-stress. I'm proud of myself but my mind is evil some days.  I'm at two weeks ...but for me it's definitely one day at a time.

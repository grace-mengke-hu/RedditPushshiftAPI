8 Days of no cigarettes thanks to vaping!

I feel better, I am consuming much less nicotine, I smell better, my teeth are whiter. Even my skin looks more clear. 

For some reason the e-cigarette is a lot less tempting than cigarettes. The nicotine in the e-cig is keeping me from smoking cigarettes but sometimes I don't even remember until about 2 or 3 pm that I can use it if I want to. It's great!! 

Lowering the nicotine in half by getting new juice next week. Then I'm done with nicotine for good. YOU CAN DO IT!!!

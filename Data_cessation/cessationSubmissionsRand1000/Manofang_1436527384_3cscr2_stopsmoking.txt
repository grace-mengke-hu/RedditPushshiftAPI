You can't quit??

Let me tell you my story... I am 31 yrs old I have been smoking on and off since I was 10 then became a pack and a half smoker after 18 b been that way ever since... I have quit 100 times( and failed 99))and never felt that I could I made excuses as to why I couldn't my job is to stressful finances are killing me so I can't quit yet it helps me clear my head.... All the same smoker lies... I quit by using patches, Nicorette, chantix, zyban, NRTs But I am glad to say that once my mind said I'm ready my body followed suit I got an app on my phone that help me track my progress I set a date and I stopped making excuses now I am 26 days into my fight to be a true non smoker now I'm not saying saying it's not hard and I'm not saying I don't fight everyday but if I can do it then anyone truly can quit but you have  to do it for it for you not for the people around you that are telling you too quit.  Like I said once my mind said it was a go my body followed suit. My mom works at hospital and she been trying me to quit for years and my wife just stopped caring if I smoked or not because she never thought I would quit just wanted to share my story... happy days to everyone quitting rocks!!  :p

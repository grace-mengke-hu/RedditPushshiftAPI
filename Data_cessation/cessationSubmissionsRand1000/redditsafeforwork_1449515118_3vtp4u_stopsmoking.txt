Just spent what little free time I did updating my calendar for the next full year.

I need smaller goals to help get me through. On the 8th, that makes 21 days. I've been doing it week by week. I updated my calendar with different amounts of time that seemed relevant to me. It's in my phone now. Little bits of celebration throughout a given month, dates to shoot toward. Did dates like amount of months, 100 days, 300 days, 250 days, etc. I think it will help me to see the short term wins knowing how my mind works. It's a good idea for me, I hope its a good idea for some others out there. 

One last thing, a friend whom I haven't hunt out with in a while (who is a smoker) is coming up for my birthday on the 9th...He is no doubt about it, one of my triggers. In fact, he is the only person that would be a trigger as he is the only one of my friends that still smoke. He and I were the last, and now he is definitively the last one. He is my best friend through and through, and I don't want to break this time, but I haven't seen the fella in a while. Any advice gang to keep my wits about me after I've had a few to drink? Or in general really. I quit once for 3 years, so I know I have it in me, but its been more than triple that amount of time since I did it last time. I want this to be *the* last time. Thanks all.

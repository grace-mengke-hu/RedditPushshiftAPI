Just Started Cutting Down

2 and a half hours ago, at 3 o'clock, I decided to start smoking every 2 hours and smoked another one at 5:00.  I'm not sure when but I'm going to switch to every 3 hours then every 4 hours at 11:00, 3:00 and 7:00 and quit on New Year's.  I want to save up for a new computer so at every 2 hours that's 4 packs a week or $50.00 saved, every 3 hours is 2 packs a week or $70.00 saved and every 4 hours is 1 pack a week or $80.00 saved.

At the beginning of this year I went from every hour and a half to every 2 hours then 3 hours was too easy so I went immediately to every 4 hours and caved.  Then later in this year I got to every 2 hours and when I tried to give up energy drinks I once again caved.  Part of what caused me to cave the first time is I didn't have a regular sleep schedule so I would lay awake for hours at a time then go smoke a cigarette.  So both times energy drinks ruined the cutting down attempt so this time I've switched to coffee first.

Everything I do now is going to be practice for when I quit.  If I'm bored with nothing to do that's good because I'm going to be bored with nothing to do when I quit.  If I become pessimistic and discouraged then I need to keep completing the intervals to show myself there's nothing to be afraid of just like when I quit.  Everything I do now is going to be a dry run for when I quit, where quitting will also be much easier since I'll only be smoking 3 times a day by the time I get to that point.

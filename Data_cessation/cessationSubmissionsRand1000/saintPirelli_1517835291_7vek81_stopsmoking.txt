3 things I wanted to hear when I started this

I hadn't realised it was almost a year for me now. Now that I am here, let me tell you some things I wish I would have heard a year ago:

* There is no right time to stop. This moment right now is just a good as any other.
* Yes, it does get easier, way easier. I'm hardly ever thinking about smoking anymore and when I do, it disgusts me.
* Yes I have gained weight after quitting (I was obese most of my life, peaking at 122kg (@182cm)). Subsequently though, quitting gave me so much confidence in my willpower, that I chnaged my diet, started lifting and lost 40kg in 7 months. Now I am leaner, fitter and more muscular than ever before, and it all started with quitting smoking.

If I can do it, you can too. I was the laziest and weakest hedonist you can imagine, giving in to almost any temptation. It all starts with just doing it.

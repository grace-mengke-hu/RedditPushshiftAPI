Today I hit 4 years smoke free!! But I still come to this subreddit often.

I can't believe it's already been 4 years since I last had a cigarette. It's crazy because I don't even remember having it, and my brain has practically erased the feeling of nicotine from it's memory. 

I will say this though -- while I don't struggle as much as I used to on a daily basis, or in social situations, I still have a tiny little "pilot light" in the back of my brain. It's the shitty YOLO part of my brain that tells me "if things get awful, you can always go back to smoking as a crutch". I fear that if something terrible happens, like breaking up with my SO of 5 years or losing a family member...it will spark the pilot light back into a roaring fire and I'll be back to a pack a day in no time. 

So that's why I come here. I come here to remember what it felt like to be a slave to the addiction, and I come to encourage you all to keep going. Because recovering smokers are always recovering, and you can never have too much encouragement to stay healthy. Thanks for reading this :)

PS - I quit using Chantix, that was my method.

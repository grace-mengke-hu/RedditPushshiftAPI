Found a pack of cigarettes today.

Today when I was walking to my car from the train station, I saw a completely undamaged pack.of cigarettes in the middle of the sidewalk. I picked them up, had a look and only one was missing. That compressed smell of tobacco as you open a pack nearly got me guys. I don't even know why I picked it up, what the fuck was I expecting? I didn't want the smoke them and I don't know anybody that did. I didn't smoke any and dropped them on the floor. 

Six months in and curiosity nearly killed the cat.

I didn't expect to just quit and stay quit but somehow I managed it. Now it's time to leave the smoking, even the 'actively quitting' behind and just see it as silly thing I used to do. Cravings have mostly gone, sometimes I get a spontanious one or one when I'm dissapointed, stressed and/or angry. Good reason to avoid such states!

Thanks for the support which has been very helpful /r/stopsmoking! May many more follow.

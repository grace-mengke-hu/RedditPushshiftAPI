Past 150 and didn't even realize

Cigarettes are such an after thought to me that I didn't even realize I was past 150. In fact I feel like being subscribed to this subreddit is more of a detriment because it reminds me of cigarettes more than I normally would. Yesterday I was at my buddy's house and he smokes in his house, didn't even phase me. In fact I gave up something else, chinese food. Never again, but I will probably get it in a few months again. 

Seriously though, keep your mind active, pick up something to learn, you'll be surprised how well it works. I drink way less than ever, nothing but good things. Keep strong people.

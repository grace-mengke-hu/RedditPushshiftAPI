92 days...

I know, another odd day to post up about but here is how I look at it...

No matter if you are on day 1, or day 1000, no matter if you have failed a million times over, you are all doing great, you have all made the right decision for yourself to better yourself

Pat yourself on the back for that, join me in non smoking today

Just Never smoke again. it's that simple at this point, it really is :)

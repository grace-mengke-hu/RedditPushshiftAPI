Quitters flu ðŸ˜· in full effect!

Ok so 1 wk under my belt! Yay ðŸ˜ƒ me!! But really though.....I canâ€™t stop coughing. Like wheezing cough!! Sinus congestion, ðŸ¤§ sneezing. Full on bronchitis like cold. WTF! Going on 3 days like this. I know everyone goes through this differently. But how damn long does it last???? Oh and BTW....never going through this shit again. Not one more puff, EVER!!!

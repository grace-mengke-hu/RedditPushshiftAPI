I can run again!

So after falling off the quit bandwagon a few weeks back, I got back on and am feeling great after 9 days.  I bought a ton of fruits, vegetables, and juice to make the withdrawal process as smooth as possible after going cold turkey.  In addition to that, I've been running every day.  As someone who hasn't run very consistently in the past 10+ years, I just wanted to share how quickly I've gotten up to speed after just a little over a week quit.


Day 1: 1.1 miles

Day 2: 1.4 miles

Day 3: 1.7 miles

Day 4: 1.9 miles

Day 5: 2.0 miles

Day 6: 2.1 miles

Day 7: 2.2 miles

Day 8: 2.3 miles

Day 9: 2.4 miles


That's a total of 17.1 miles in my first 9 days.  To compare, I ran a total of 11 miles all of last year.  Every day I just try to run a block of two further than the day before.  I just think it's crazy how much further I can run just a week after I was dead after a mile.  

Just goes to show how much your body thanks you for not killing your lungs.  I'm now getting to the point where my legs are crapping out on me instead of not being able to breathe, which I'll take as a huge win.

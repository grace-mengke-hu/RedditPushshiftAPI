My FINAL day one!

I finally admitted to myself I can't do cold turkey (works for some, don't get me wrong) and went to see a stop smoking specialist.  Got some NRT and a 12 week program!! So thrilled, will keep updated and also of course I couldn't have even got this far without this sub.  Thank you all.

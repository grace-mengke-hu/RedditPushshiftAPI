I will smoke a cigarette in a bout a day 100% please give me your oponion

Im an 15 year old Male (75kg 184cm)pretty healthy besides of little bit of fucked up liver but nothing too serius. I have a long history of substance use (only Weed with tobacco in it and alot of Alcohol). So I usualy I smoke 2-5 joints a week with half of tobbaco in it (sometimes i am clean for 2 weeks).
But im curently on vacation so im gonna smoke a cig since i already smoke tobaco with weed through rolled up filter (self made filter is way worse than usual cig filter cuz is loose no filtering whatsoever) Im pretty strong on not getting addicted to it but i never smoked a cig before and im fairly certain its only once for now (i can easily control alchol and weed,also i know all those risks associated with tobbaco) Also sorry for my english im from Balkan speaking countries.Whats your opinion id like to hear

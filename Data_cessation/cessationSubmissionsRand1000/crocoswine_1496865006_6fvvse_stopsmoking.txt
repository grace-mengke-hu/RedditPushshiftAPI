Well frick.

I goofed after a good while. More embarrassed than anything, but other emotions are popping up too obviously. I'm not dwelling on it but I'm taking note on how not to trip up again. Thanks for your help pals, my badge reset has already been submitted, I don't even want to know how many days I'm throwing away. :(

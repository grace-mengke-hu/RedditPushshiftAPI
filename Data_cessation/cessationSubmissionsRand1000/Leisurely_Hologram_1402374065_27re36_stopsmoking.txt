I'm 48 hours in and feel like dog shit.

Not because I quit but I have a horrendous cough that almost puts me on the ground and sometimes makes me gag a bit. It's scary. I've been smoking on and off for 10 years and am nearly 30. I need to quit. I even got a little drunk today and didn't smoke, which feels neat. I don't know what support feels like, but I think I can get help here. Thanks :)

Lighter fluid, batteries, poison, sewer gas, insecticide, toilet cleaner.. day 18

18 days is by far the furthest I've come in previous attempts where I caved after about five days to a week after quitting every time. Doing really well, I've got to keep this up now. Cravings have gone to once or twice a day which is nice. Planning on stopping the day counting and reminders, which are more common than the cravings now, pretty soon to evolve to the next stage of becoming a 'non-smoker'.

Overview of benefits so far:

- No need to go out in the freezing cold
- More free time
- More stamina and energy
- Less sneaking around or feelings of being ashamed
- More self-confidence 
- Better smell and taste, can eat any time I want and not schedule aroun a cigarette
- Motivating others to quit by leading by example
- Better skin, looking better

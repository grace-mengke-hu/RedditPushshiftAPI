Want to stop smoking? Do it RIGHT NOW

I cant count how often I told myself "that day I am going to quit", but I never did it. I was during a smoke that I had a moment of epiphany and just said "fuck this", put out the cigarette and never touched one since. If you really want to, do it now. You can do it! We are all here for you.

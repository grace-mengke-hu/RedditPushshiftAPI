The junky in my head is restless

After the physical withdrawl passes, addiction is a mindfuck. Recently I've been feeling the sighs coming back, I've been reaching for a pack of non existent smokes, I've been feeling all the physical things I associate with smoking. Mentally, I'm ok. I'm still blaming the junky in my head. I do not want to smoke. I'm terrified of starting smoking again. Not because I think I will, I don't believe that I'll ever smoke tobacco again. I know the evil of it first hand. I'm terrified because I know that if I ever smoke just 1 puff from a cig I'll be a dead woman. I'll be right back smoking like a chimney and I'll never be strong enough to throw off the shackles of that addiction again. So shut the fuck up junky. Nobody likes you anyway!

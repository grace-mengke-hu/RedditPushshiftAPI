Milestone: 105 days

It's been quite a while, and it's been easier than I expected. And it gets easier everyday. I guess the only advice I'd like to share is, **don't smoke**. No matter what.

I had to avoid parties, bars and LSD at the beginning. Because those 3 things were like the worst smoker bait ever. But now I feel really good. I just regret I didn't quit earlier.

To everyone who is struggling, it's totally doable. And the reward for completely quitting is amazing.

I'm on the backslide.

I had one while drinking two weekends ago. I bought a pack while drinking this weekend. I bought another pack this morning. I don't want to smoke. Yet I keep smoking. I was so happy when the other pack was gone yesterday. Happy to be free again and I went and enslaved myself again this morning. I feel like I'm destined to do this forever. Quit and start and quit and start and say screw it for a while and then quit and start. I want to be done.

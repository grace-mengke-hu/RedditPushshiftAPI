getting through the holidays in retail

so today marks a week of no smoking! i chose an interesting time to quite, right at the beginning of finals and smack dab in the middle of the busiest times in retail. i work sales and for the last five years i worked, i would take a smoke break every 2 hours on the dot, and if i didn't take one i would get antsy and irritable. So, to say the least, i was scared of giving them up. But i must say, its like a weight was lifted off of my shoulders. to not physically feel the need to smoke every two hours has actually made work better. It goes by quicker and i don't find myself as irritable. The first couple of days of quitting the cravings were bad, but it gets better every passing day. Hang in there everyone!

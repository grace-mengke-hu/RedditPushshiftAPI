Today, May 16, is going to be my 3rd day of quitting cigarettes.

This is a personal reminder, but also a way to participate on this reddit which I sometimes read in the past whenever I wanted to quit. 

I'm 26, my first cig was when I was 12, my grand-parents and parents are all smokers, including most uncles and aunts. I was smoking nearly a pack a day (about 15-20 a day, sometimes more if I drank alcohol). I'm also asthmatic.

The longest I quit was 1 month, but then I went to see my family (I've been living a little far away from them now) and when I saw everyone smoking in the house, smelling cigarettes, seeing cigarettes everywhere, I could not resist, I had a weakness. I told myself "just one or two...". Then "just while i'm staying here" and then it was too late, I went back to smoking nearly a pack a day. 

Reaons for quiting again : caughing muccus every morning which makes me gag and want to vomit everytime. Being out of breath with the smallest exercices, i'm going to travel 2 weeks and doing alot of hiking and I want to be in better shape for it, I'm going on a date with a very smart, nice and beautiful girl who is also very healthy and I want to do activities with her, and I do not want to be a slave to nicotine anymore.

It's 1 A.M at my place right now, i'm working at 8:30 A.M and I can't sleep, i'm craving for a cigarette. But i'm going to stay strong.

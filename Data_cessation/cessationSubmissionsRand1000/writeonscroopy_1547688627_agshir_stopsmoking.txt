Day 3 and I'm pissed off at everything and can't concentrate on anything! Anyone out there relate?

Hey Stopsmoking. Chronic relapser here on my millionth quit and day 3 cold turkey. Previously smoked 1/2 pack or more a day since I was a teenager (I'm 39 now), with some weeks/months here and there quitting completely with NRT (patch, gum) or vaping. I've decided to not vape or use any kind of NRT this time around.

To put it mildly, I feel like I'm losing my fucking mind and I get annoyed/pissed at every little thing. Is this a Day 3 thing? Will it get better the next couple days? I took an edible and a valium to take the edge off, but fuck, I feel like my emotions are all over the place and I just want to scream. Is this normal? Anyone know when my emotions will start to regulate a bit and I can be chill again?  

Thank you! I won't smoke with you today :)

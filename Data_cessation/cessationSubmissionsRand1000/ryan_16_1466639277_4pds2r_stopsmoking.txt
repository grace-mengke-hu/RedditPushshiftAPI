50 days & what helped me

I just turned 20. I smoked a half pack/day for 2 years. I failed dozens and dozens of times, but this last and final attempt has brought me to 51 days. most days now go by without even the thought of a cigarette. sure, I wasn't a lifetime smoker but I really don't think it makes a notable difference.


the first (and still recent) weeks were tough emotionally. I hit a new low with my depression and was additionally diagnosed with DPD. my panic attacks flared up again. they put me back on meds as well. but things are looking up. I don't fully blame the cigarettes for this, but they had a decent impact no doubt. oh, and alcohol is still a trigger for me. it has become more manageable, but when I drank I usually called a friend or asked someone with me to just be there for me. stay occupied.


honey, ginger, and garlic!!! (preferably not eaten together but you do you). each is full of different antioxidants and have antiviral/antibacterial properties. raw honey helps to clear the lungs of tar and other shit. I normally put a spoonful in my lemon ginger tea. some days I slice off a thin bit of ginger root and eat it as well. 4g a day is recommended I believe. as far as garlic goes, I eat 1-2 cloves each night. you can crush them and down them like pills so your breath doesn't smell, or you can sprinkle them on top of peanut butter toast. it's not GOOD but it isn't bad either. the goal is to reap the health benefits anyways.


finally, nicotine addiction is mostly in your head, after the hump. I pushed myself over the hump due to a cancer scare among other things (a lot easier said). you just need to get over that hump. lifestyle change helps. adjust your diet, sleep on the opposite end of your bed, finally block out your ex, do anything that makes you feel different. it's worth it. you can come back from smoking, in both mind and body. nobody can make you quit but yourself. stick to it. you're stronger than you think.

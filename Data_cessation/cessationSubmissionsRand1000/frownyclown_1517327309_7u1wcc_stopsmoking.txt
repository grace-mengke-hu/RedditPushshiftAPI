90 DAYS Free, turns out there is a LOT more to life now!

I know it sounds like hyperbole and wishful thinking, but my life is so much more than it was when I was smoking.  I have energy.  That right there is the big game changer.  I never understood how much life was sucked out of me with every dirty smokey puff.  That energy has made me so much more productive at work, at home, and in all the activities in my life.  I'm putting up shelves, running for a Board of a local organization, and getting more done at work.  

It might not just be the fact that my lungs are working better, or that my circulation has improved, or that sinuses aren't clogged, but I think it's a major part.  

I'm not going to say I wasted 20 years smoking, but I did waste a good percentage of those years suffering from low energy.  

If you are just starting your quit, please stay with it.  We need you at your best!

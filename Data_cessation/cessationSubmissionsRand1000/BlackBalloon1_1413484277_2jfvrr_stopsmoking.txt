Lungs After Quitting

I have a question about the lungs healing after quitting. In the past I had researched this topic and remember learning that 1) Although the lungs can heal themselves, there will be permanent damage (reduced lung capacity) and 2) that it takes >5 years for the tar to be removed from the lungs. 

I don't know if these are in fact true or not. Either way - my concern is what happens to the tar when it "falls" off the lungs? Where does it go? Do you cough it up, or do the lymph nodes take care of it? Does anyone have anymore information about this?

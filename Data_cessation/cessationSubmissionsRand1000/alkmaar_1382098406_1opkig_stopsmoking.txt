2 weeks done and dusted!

Guys i'll be honest with you..The first week was much easier to deal with than the second. Physical withdrawals were a walk in the park to be honest. I had the right mental state going into this experience and was fully prepared for any physical set-backs i may experience. But Jesus christ i was not prepared for the mental withdrawals at all. 

For those familiar with the lord of the rings, Frodo wasn't fucking around when he asked to have his ring back. It feels like i'm constantly at war with my subconscious by staying away from the nico-demon. But that son of a bitch brain is a clever fuck. It knows exactly how to lure me back and my god is it convincing. 
I'm still at it and i hope it will get less frequent because this is almost impossible to bear with given the routine i have. 

As always, here's a list of things i've noticed:

* Been running daily for the past week. I've seen an immense boost in stamina since i started and doing 6 KM is not that big a deal now.
* Still no improvement in taste. I've heard that starts kicking in after the first month.
* My smell sense is great and has been one of the biggest incentives to keep at it. 
* Mucus slightly diluted but is present in my throat and nostrils. Im not complaning since i've heard this takes a long time to really repair.
* Sleep is excellent. Much Much better than what i'd normally have.
* My appetite has surprisingly decreased immensely. I'd get full very quickly with very little portions.

That's it for now i guess. Will let you know if i cave in soon. Peace

Scumbag brain: Rationalizing smoking

I'm back, as I knew I would be, with just a few observations about my first day off the cancer sticks. 

I'm finding that throughout the day I've tried to think of any way to go about having a smoke.. "Oh maybe if I buy some herbal cigs this will be easier", "Maybe instead of going cold turkey I can just buy a pack and taper off", "I could just bum one take some drags here and there and make it last all day."

Fuck all that. Staying strong, and I finally feel positive about quitting smoking - instead of filled with panic. Not to say it hasn't been tough, it has been one hell of a day, but I'm confident. Good luck out there everyone!

Lady quitters...menstrual changes?

Hi everyone! I'm a month in today (hooray!) and going strong, but have a question for the lady quitters here. Have any of you experienced changes in your menstrual cycle since quitting? My last cycle was only about 2 weeks ago but it feels like I'm coming up on another cycle here.

I looked around the web and don't really see much solid data or response on this subject and I know the ladies of Reddit are a treasure trove of information :) Anything you could share with me would be greatly appreciated!

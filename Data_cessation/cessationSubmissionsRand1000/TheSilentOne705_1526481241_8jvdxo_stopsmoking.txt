Relapsed back in October. Back on the wagon on my mother's birthday.

As the title says, I relapsed in October of last year; there was a lot of stress in my life from moving and getting a new roommate, plus keeping up with work and my side hustle (cosplay/making). It doesn't excuse dropping off. I was doing pretty well; over 6 months on the wagon. I should have gotten a vape or something instead of grabbing cigs. But I did, and there it is.

Life has been kinder to me recently though, and I definitely liked having the extra cash from not smoking. Plus the health benefits.

It's been about 11 days; I visited my mom for her birthday and decided to get a vape (I did take her out for her birthday and bought her a nice present, so I didn't forget). Went to a somewhat shady little store that happened to know exactly what they were doing. The two guys there were super helpful, understood what I was looking for, and hooked me up with an excellent little vape along with a free bottle of juice for it. 

Now I feel better than ever (even with the coughing and other symptoms) and my bank account looks great. 

For those of you who do fall off, get back on quick. It's not worth it to go back.

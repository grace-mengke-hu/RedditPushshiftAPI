First day (well, first morning even)

I smoked my last cigarette last night before I went to bed, and quit after that. I literally tore up all the remaining cigarettes in the pack and flushed them, so I wouldn't have anything to smoke in the house.

Got up about half an hour ago and in stead of smoking, I took a shower before I started working and ate breakfast. But literally am going insane already. First thing that popped into my head: me smoking on the balcony. And that image doesn't want to go away, even though I keep saying 'NO' and just do other stuff. 

I hope the cravings will pass soon, because this is hard. Please send me a lot of motivation to keep me going strong!

One year, could not have done it without ya'll!!!!

I just wanted to take a quick second to thank everyone on this wonderful subreddit. I could not have done it without your support! I asked a lot of questions early on during my quit. It was simply invaluable knowing that everyone on here was going through or had gone through what I was. Thank you all. 

For those of you who have been smoke free for a while, keep at it. You are an inspiration. For those of you who just started, don't give up. you CAN do this. Not one puff, not ever!

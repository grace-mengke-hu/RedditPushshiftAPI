Go ahead Mother Nature!

Had a thought this morning: Yesterday was a rainy day. The old me would have suffered getting wet just to get my nicotine fix. The old me would have huddled in the corner of my balcony when it's cold and windy to hurriedly puff my cigarette. The old me would have subjected myself to the worst of weather conditions just to suck back noxious fumes!

But now- no more. Mother nature is welcome to send me rain, sleet and snow because I no longer need to stand out in it to satisfy my cravings. Just another reason why I enjoy being the new, non-smoking me :)

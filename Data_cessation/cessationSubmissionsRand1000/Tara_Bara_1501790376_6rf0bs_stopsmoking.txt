Self Respect

There's something different about this quit. I think I'm actually doing it for ME - not because I've been told I have to, or I feel pressure from someone/thing. Granted the past 8 days have not been easy, but every time I think of relapsing, I think of myself as someone I love...like ACTUALLY love, and I don't want to do that do her. It's a little like looking from the outside, in. 

I've also noticed that when people are rude or say/do something to upset me, rather than run back to my cigs, I actually give them a piece of my mind and tell them what (in all honesty) that need to hear. Which I can tell by the looks on their faces shocks them, cause they're so used to me submitting and biting my tongue (cause I'd just run and hide with my smokes). But now it's like, "Hold on! Who the hell do you think you are talking to me like that?!" Frankly, it feels kinda nice letting it all out.

So although I'm still trudging along day by day with this quit, I've found I am sticking up for myself in multiple ways. The respect I've gained for myself in a little over a week is quickly multiplying.

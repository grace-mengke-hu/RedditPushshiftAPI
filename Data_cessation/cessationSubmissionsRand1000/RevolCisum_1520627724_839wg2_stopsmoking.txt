Day 5... Day 4 didn't get me, woohoo!

Work yesterday tested me.  Work today is testing me.  BUT, I'm still not smoking.  I feel anxious, and jittery, and sick, and frustrated... And fanfuckingtastic!  Bc, I am in control of myself, finally!  I am coping without cigs (using nrt, but whatevs).  I am fucking doing this!!!!

"Quit" Almost a Year Ago, But Having Trouble With Motivation Lately

I still haven't started smoking regularly again, but the last couple of months I've been smoking every once in a while. I moved to my hometown and almost all of my friends smoke. I like to smoke with them socially, but lately I've been smoking at home, too.

Having trouble staying motivated not to, especially since I don't know if I'll be able to NOT smoke when I'm around all my friends who're smoking. It's not like I can just stop hanging out with them. I mean, I could, but some of these people I've known for 10 years or more. They're close friends.

Any advice?

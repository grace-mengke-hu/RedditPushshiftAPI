Work hard in silence ...

*Let success be your noise!*

I've noticed that since i quit my social interactions are decreasing. 
Most of my friends are smokers.
I realised that all the time i used to hang out with them was mostly motivated by the desire to take drugs. Drinking, mary jane and of course having some cigs.
Now that my day isn't evolving around nicotin no more, i have better things to do with my time. 
I am working out, working hard on my duties, reading etc. etc. 
From my perspective now i am afraid of the waste of time that comes with smoking.
I am looking at my friends and they really seem to be  imprisoned by their addiction(s). (Tobbaco)
They don't want to *see* what they are doing to themselves, how miserable ones live truly is, when caught in addiction. They would rather die than climbing the mountain and seeing the vastness of destruction they are living in.
I was there too. 
But i saw what i was doing and i am trying to change. Stop smoking may seem like a small step to take, but really it is a big one for everyone who used to smoke. 
Maybe i am more alone now that i averted myself from this miserable and destructive lifestyle. 
But I love it. Now i have the time and power to create. The fight of my addiction isn't over yet, but i certainly know it's for good!

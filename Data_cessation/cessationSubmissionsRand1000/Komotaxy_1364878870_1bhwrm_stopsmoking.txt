Taste

Today I treated myself to a burger from a local drive-up burger joint. Now I'm drinking some delicious Hefaweizen beer and a little bit of dark spiced rum.

My taste is starting to come back, and wow, it is amazing. Being a food lover I have missed flavor so damn much after smoking for a while.

If you're still thinking about quitting smoking, just imagine how good your favorite food *used* to taste. 

I forgot how good flavors are, don't let nicotine take you away from the true pleasures of life!

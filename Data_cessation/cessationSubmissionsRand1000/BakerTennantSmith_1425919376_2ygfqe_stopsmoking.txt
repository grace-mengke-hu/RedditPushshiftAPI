30 days today . . . or in my parallel universe, 57-1 days LOL

What have I learned: 

* Smoke smells really, really bad
* I love exercise now that I can breathe
* I still find random clothes that smell like smoke and realize I need to wash ALL the clothes
* I cannot have a drink and NOT want to smoke. So I quit drinking for reals. I am a stupid drunk anyway. HA (Don't even ask me how many FB posts I have to delete or apologize for the day after. It is not pretty)
* The simple tips of: Drink water, chew sugarless gum, fruit, veggies, and take walks REALLY REALLY do work. A lot
* You reach a point where you don't think about it. The obsessive thoughts DO end. I promise 
* I woke up today and realized my skin is looking AMAZING! I'm a woman. I'm vain. This stuff matters to me.
* Weight gain stops. I now work out, count calories, drink a crap ton of water, etc. 
* And I'm hoping sometime soon to test out the "Better sex" theory I keep hearing about, ha. Even my stop smoking text talked about that today. Such a tease. 

Anyway, Allen Carr's book is good. It is soo soo good. And so right. He may ramble and cannot actually write well, but the dude knows what he speaks of. 

1 month feels pretty fantabulous. I'm going to test out my new working lungs on some pretty hard workouts this week. Yay!

Feeling of emptiness, boredom

I am smoke free since 40 days and in these time a gained lot of confidence that i will never smoke again, and also very proud of my achievement.
I barely get the cravings, but my real problem  is that i always feel empty and bored and many time question the existence of life also, i hope it's temporary and may go away soon.
But if any one has any idea about how to deal with such feelings, his/her opinion is welcome

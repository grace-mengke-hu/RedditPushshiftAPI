Has anyone been feeling chesty in the mornings?

When I smoked, I used to wake up with a dry throat because I smoked right before I slept.
Now, every now and then I wake up with a "wet" chesty feeling and a feeling of too much saliva.
I haven't had the after smoking cough or hocking up phlegm since I've quit.
There's no pain or sore throat, just feels like I've been inhaling saliva.

And it seems I can never get enough sleep. Most nights it can take me hours to sleep. But if I fall asleep at midnight, I can easily sleep past 1pm, wtf is wrong with me?

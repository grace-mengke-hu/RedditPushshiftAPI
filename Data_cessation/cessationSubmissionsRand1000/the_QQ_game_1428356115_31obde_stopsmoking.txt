First craving in a long time

Hey, folks. This might seem depressing, that I'm still having cravings but the truth is, this is the first craving I've really had in over a week... maybe more. I've lost track.

It went from constantly wanting a cigarette. NEEDING a cigarette. Every. Damn. Moment. Then a few days passed. And it got a little better and a little better. Then after maybe a week. I thought about smoking once a day. Then, sometimes, I wouldn't think about smoking.

I'm not giving in to that urge. I know I've come a long way and I want to give some encouragement to anyone starting out. Hell, how about encouragement to the old-timers as well.

4 Months down

This past couple months have flown by. I love being a non smoker. Everyone that I quit with has gone back to smoking which is kind of a bummer but I know that I am not going back to that filthy addiction. Still have odd cravings here and there but they go away so quick now and it isn't every day. I don't check the smoke free app anymore religiously but I did today and saw that it has been 4 months and I was blown away.

Keep at it everyone, this subreddit is easily one of the best ones and every one of you can stop.

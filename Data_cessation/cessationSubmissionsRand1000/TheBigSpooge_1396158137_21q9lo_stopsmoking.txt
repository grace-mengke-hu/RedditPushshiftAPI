At the breaking point

I've been grinding my teeth, working like a dog, craving like a fiend and generally hating my life for the past two days.  I have nothing of value to occupy my time when I'm not working, so I came home and started drinking, and now I'm contemplating the emptiness of my life and wondering why I should put up with the trouble of quitting smoking.  I am posting this as a last-ditch effort at keeping up my 3-week record.  If I don't get a response in 5 minutes, then I'm going to the gas station down the street and lighting up.

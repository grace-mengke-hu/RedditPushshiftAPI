Just competed in my first half marathon!

Hey all, quitters and lurkers. Just checking in and updating on my progress. I was a smoker for over 10 years, I quit in January, I'm 26 now. At its height I smoked over 60 a day (30 grams). That's all changed. This sub has helped me realise how many others there are and how pointless smoking really is. 

I started running just over two months ago, it was though. But man it's been worth it. I have competed in my first [half marathon](http://imgur.com/aYF0edh) and managed 1:37:41. I wouldn't have dreamed of that a year ago. So if you're thinking it's too late to stop, it's not. It's possible.

Good luck all and thanks!

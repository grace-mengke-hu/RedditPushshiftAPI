Four weeks :)

I just came here to see my badge :)

Feel a lot better than last week so far! The cravings have fallen off a shelf, although I'm still finding it better not to think in long-term ways. If I think "and I'll never smoke again" I automatically start to miss it, but if I just choose not to smoke today (every day) then I don't miss it at all.

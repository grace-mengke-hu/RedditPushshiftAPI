Day 25!!

I made it through 24 days and have about 6 left of day 25.  Somethings that helped me:
Day 1-7 I did a 7 day cleanse.  It helped pass the nicotine out quicker, I think.  
Day 5?- I literally slept through the day; didn’t get out of bed; kept my eyes shut all day; was the worst day of the first week.  
Day 1- now- drank a ton of water.  Cravings still come but they are much easier to get through now.  
Day 1- now- I do the smoke free app missions daily- they really helped me. 
Day 1- now- I haven’t had a drink.  Alcohol is a huge trigger for me.  February 1 I will be having a few.
Cravings- when cravings came on repeating my mantras really helped.  Now when I say them, like smoke free app mission had me do today, they are more of a resolved saying, as oppose to non-confident saying.  Water- I have drunk so much water the last 24.5 days it’s not even funny.  Money- I’ve saved over $300 so far... in 24.5 days- that’s crazy how stupid I was literally watching my money go up in smoke.  
Days 1-5 were not easy. 
Days 12-14 were not easy.
Day 18 was not easy.  
Craving still come but they are little, and pretty easy to beat now. 
Moral of the story, and I know it’s cliche- if I can do it, you can do it.  I was at least smoking a pack and a half a day; more if i went out for drinks.  It was hard but it is worth it.  
Way to go everybody.  Keep it up.

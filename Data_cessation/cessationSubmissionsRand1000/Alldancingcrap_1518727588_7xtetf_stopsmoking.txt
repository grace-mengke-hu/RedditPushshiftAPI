Day three. Had to jump through some hurdles but I’m proud of myself.

I know three days isn’t much to write home about. My badge says two, but technically in about an hour it’ll be three. 

Yesterday my boyfriend of five years and I got into an argument (yes, over Vday). I got into my car and almost started it to go to the store to buy a pack. 

Instead I sat for a few minutes. Took a few deep breaths, and got out of the car and went back inside. The arguing continued, but I didn’t slip up, and instead shortly after went to bed). 

Today, driving home after class, stressed from clinic and how I did on a test. I was upset from last nights argument with the boyfriend.  (Still am). Instead of passing the house and continuing down the street toward the gas station, I took a short left into my driveway. Immediately got in the shower instead of buying a pack. 

I’m proud of myself for fighting the cravings and not giving up. Any other quit I would have went straight to the store without turning back. 

Thanks for listening, and good luck to everyone here.

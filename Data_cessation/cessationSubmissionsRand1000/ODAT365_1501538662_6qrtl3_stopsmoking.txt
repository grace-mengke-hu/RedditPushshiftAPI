How long, after 10 years 20 a day, until I will feel normal again?

Tell me, do you remember how long it was until you started to feel normal again, peaceful? Like you had never smoked before?

Day 7 and I'm handling ok. Several failed attempts in the past years, the one attempt lasted a little past a year. 

Today though, my head is much clearer on the mental obsession (I have been reading, researching and studying quitting for months), the body strong in training, and the soul simply done with the guilt I carry when smoking. I was a secretive smoker. 

However, my mouth is regularly salivating, literally for a smoke, and so much too, whilst the post nasal drip irritating me to no end. Some obsession still stubbornly persists but I have if-then plans for those moments, usually over in minutes, but can return at will...

An earlier post I read gives me hope, that as long as I don't light another, I too will pass my 1,000 day mark - and I hope that I don't remember the day cause I hope smoking by then is so far removed from my body mind and soul. 

Thanks for everyone's posts for a poor nicotine addiction like me. 

One day at a time!

Ex-smoker's do it better. - Day 17

I'm so glad i quit smoking, and glad that i have smoked the last 12 years too.

No regrets, that's my motto.

The fact is, being an ex-smoker give's me an understanding on how great is to live, to breath, in general, teaches me that i can power through basically anything.

My mood.

My fails and mistakes.

I can evolve, i can become better.

Every craving that i tame, reminds me how strong my will has become,  and i use it in other areas of my life. To be a better person, to leave the melancoly behind.

I used to sit for a smoke, and judge other people. Their mistakes, their foolishness, their emptiness.

How can people be so naive, how can they live like livestock.

And there i was, manipulated, destroying myself.

Pathetically thinking "i can't handle this, i need a smoke".

Now i look at myself and think, damn, how could i be so weak.

And it became a reminder, of how pityfull i can be, how weak and pathetic.

Being an ex-smoker taught me, how great i am, and how stupid i can be too.

And it give's me the tools to measure myself, anything that can be measured, can be managed.

How great life can be.

I want to reach my full potential, its never too late.

To the new quitters, create the mindset, become your own master again.

For me it has been so easy that i'm astonished.

You only need to REALLY believe in yourself.

I had a very frightening event happen last night and I was resolved to start smoking this am......

but here I am determined that the fear I went thru last night will pass but starting smoking will last and last........in defeat, disgust and a lingering feeling of hopelessness.

A neighbor came over and threatened me (his wife standing there) over the fact someone turned him in to the Planning Dept over his converting the garage into a room.  The HOA has been after him for awhile.  I tried to tell him it could of been anyone of the neighbors but all he did was tell me (screaming) that he was going to make my life so miserable that I'd move.  

Anyhow.  Please, for all that's holy, could a few of you step up and give me some reality checks about staying clean from smoking?  I have to take the bus into town and that's where I'll be able to buy.  I'm desperate folks.

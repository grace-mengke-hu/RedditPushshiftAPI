Finally! 3-6-5.

Just checking in to formally mark the anniversary of my quit day 8 June 2014.  It's been a year with many challenges, some of which I've never had to face before - but all along I have ensured 'I will not smoke today.'  You can do it too, the time passes quicker and the ease of quitting comes with it, especially after 90 days, you can do it.  Go cold turkey and ride the first few horrible weeks, I promise you it will be the best decision you made this year.

Join me in not smoking today, tomorrow or ever.  Thanks everyone.

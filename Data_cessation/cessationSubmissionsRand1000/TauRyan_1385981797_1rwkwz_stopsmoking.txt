So, I'm having to start over....

I was doing so well, too. I reset my badge tonight. It was at 641 days.

I picked the habit back up in October of this year. My wife never quit and always leaves her pack by the door. Wasn't a temptation until one day.....

I don't even recall what the trigger was. Most likely, something not going my way in an online game of some sort. One won't hurt, right? Well, next thing I knew I was buying my own and it was all downhill from there.

Well, a week ago Sunday, I got sick. I've contracted the combo of bronchitis and the flu for the third time in my life. The only good thing about it is that I literally can't smoke. Even the slightest puff, and it's like my lungs are on fire. I haven't had or wanted one for the last 7 days. Thrown the ones I'd bought out with the trash.

I did tell my wife that I'm using this as a way to quit for good, if anything. I try to talk to her about quitting, but she's one of those people that will get angry and defensive anytime it's brought up.

Anyway, here's to Round 2...

EDIT: I know my 7 days is due to my illness, but I could have found a way to feed the nicotine monster. I didn't. No patches, no lozenges, and dipping is just gross.

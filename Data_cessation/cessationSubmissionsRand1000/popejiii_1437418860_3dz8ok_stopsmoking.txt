I did it! ONE YEAR!

I was a pack a day smoker for almost 10 years, and I honestly never thought I would stop.  Now I run almost 5 miles a day and feel sooo much better.

You can do it too! If you haven't yet, read Allen Carr's book.  Finish it! It took me 6 months to get through it because I was scared of quitting, but I am sure glad I did.

Thanks for all the support here.  You guys are amazing! One day at a time!

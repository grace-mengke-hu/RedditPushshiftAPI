1 month today

Also during that one month I have watched my beloved Wales on a rollercoaster journey in the Euro's. If I can survive that and not smoke I think after 9 years of smoking i'm ok. Teeth and gums are in a lot of pain though but thanks to some links on here I know that's normal. I haven't drank in 6 weeks though. Every time I have crumbled preivously it's been when I have drank so i'm not looking forward to that battle

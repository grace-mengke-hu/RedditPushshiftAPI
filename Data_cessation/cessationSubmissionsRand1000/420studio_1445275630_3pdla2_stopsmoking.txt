3 Weeks!

Well today marks three weeks. It has been a pretty bumpy road but it is getting easier every day. Today kind of sucks though, since I started driving to work this morning I really have not stopped craving a cig. It isn't a horrible craving but it is there, whatever it will go away soon enough. 

I have not changed anything in my schedule from when I was a smoker to now and I think that actually really helped me out a lot. I like what I do. I like sitting outside in the cold with a hot cup of coffee. I like going out to the bars. I like golfing and getting drunk while doing it. I just do it now without smoking. And every time I go out it gets so much easier to deal with and I don't think about it too much.

Well, that is all I really have to say about it. I am proud of myself. Everyone that is new- YOU GOT THIS!!

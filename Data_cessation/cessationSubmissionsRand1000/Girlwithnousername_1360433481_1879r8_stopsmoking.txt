Chantix/Champix users: a quick question re: speed of effectiveness

What did you set your quit date as and were you able to quit by it? My nurse told me I absolutely HAVE to give up by day 14, which is Tuesday. Currently on day 11, I'm smoking less but I don't mentally feel as though I don't need to smoke yet.

I'm a bit worried :/

Advice/experience sharing would be much appreciated. 

EDIT: it seems my nurse was misinformed. The leaflet says up to day 35. Thanks for all your replies.

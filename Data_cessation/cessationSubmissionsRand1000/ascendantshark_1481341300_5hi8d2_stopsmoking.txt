non-smoking hotel room

I must be near a smoking room because the disgusting 2nd hand stench is filling the hallways and a little bit is seeping into my room. It's a good sign that I find it revolting now, and a reminder of how smoking pretty much ruins the air quality for those around you, even behind closed doors. Gross dude.

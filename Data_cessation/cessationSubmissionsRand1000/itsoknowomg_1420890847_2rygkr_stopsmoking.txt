Relapsed non-smoker

Yesterday i went drinking with few friends and met one girl, she stopped smoking in the summer and started again month ago, i asked her why she did start again. 

She answered: because i want to enjoy everything in life, its too short. 
I just noded and moved on cause i knew its her addiction talk, and i know that talking sense to smoker is like talking to a wall. 

Point of this is, that i realized, more u know about smoking /nicotine in general, then its much easier to rezist urges or see lies about how other people describe their addiction. Its like knowing their nicotine minds.

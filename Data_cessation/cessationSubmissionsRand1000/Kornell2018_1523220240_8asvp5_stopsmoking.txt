Cant Stopppp

I used to smoke. Then i quit for 3 years - 0 cigarrettes. But last summer i started again. I noticed that every time i go out i want to smoke. I tried to pay attention what triggers it - today i understood its booze. Even if i had a beer and i am in a good vibe, i want to smoke - and smoked almost a pack today. I smoked only on weekends, but still, i want to quit. PLZ HELP
any advice would be nice.

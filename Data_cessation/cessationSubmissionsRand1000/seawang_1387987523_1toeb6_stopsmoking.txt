Broke my streak :(

Edit: I ALMOST FORGOT. MERRY CHRISTMAS YA NERDS. 

After going out drinking several weekends in a row and *not* smoking, I finally gave in last night while I was very drunk and had a cigarette. 

I immediately regretted it, and I'm pretty disappointed. But I guess I can be proud that I only had one- in moments of drunkenness during other quitting stints I've been prone to chain smoking into the night. 


SIGH. OH WELL. 20 day streak. Time to reset. WISH ME LUCK.

Wicked psycho demon cravings

I slipped Sunday night and drank a lot (*a lot*) and took a few pulls off of people's cigarettes and now, a few days later, I am having the worst cravings so far. All I want is a cigarette but I also know that if I smoke, I'll get nauseous and make everything harder. But also I want a cigarette. Ugh. Talk me down from the ledge, my friends. Please.

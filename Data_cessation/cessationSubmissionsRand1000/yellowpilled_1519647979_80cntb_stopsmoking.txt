I need your help - a picture of Allen Carr as a saint

Hello guys,

recently one of my friends stopped smoking because I gave him Allen Carrs book as a present. As a birthday gift I wanted to print out a poster of Allen Carr as a picture of a saint. You know, this picture that a lot of people use with the US Secretary of Defense James Mattis (https://www.aafnation.com/products/st-mattis-the-patron-saint-of-chaos-poster?variant=39658436746) but with Allen Carrs Face. I don't have any photoshop skills so is there anyone in this awesome community who could do this for me (or rather my friend)

I would be so thankful!
Wish you all the best (and if you havent read his books yet, do it!)

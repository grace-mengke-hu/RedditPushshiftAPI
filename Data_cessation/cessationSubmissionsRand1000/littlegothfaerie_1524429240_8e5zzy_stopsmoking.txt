Tantrums after 3mo

I’m having a real hard time this past week with the cravings. Everything seemed good, I would go weeks without cravings, but for some reason it’s been so bad lately. I’m talking full-blown anxiety attacks, tantrums, and sheer willpower. I got into a small tiff with my boyfriend yesterday and goddamn it if I didn’t completely ruin our one night out a week. I had to go cry in the bathroom! Idk I’m feeling kinda pathetic today and wallowey and I could use some encouragement to not smoke...

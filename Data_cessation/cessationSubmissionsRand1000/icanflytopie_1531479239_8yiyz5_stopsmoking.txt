Feeling hopeless due to night venues, drinks...

Hey all,

I've had some pretty great success at quitting.

It seems as though I ALWAYS give in when I'm out with buds. Last night I was at a get together at a friend's with a hot tub, some pretty girls &amp; drinks. It's like whenever I have some drinks I always, somehow, find some cigarettes from someone else there.

I smoked four. Being 22, &amp; having a roommate next semester who likes to have some people over and drink at times is making me nervous. I don't think the life style of going to a couple of parties with drinks and cigarettes will fade anytime soon... I just feel hopeless because I'm so disciplined when I'm completely sober but hate being a buzzkill at parties (i.e. not drinking at all.) It's all especially tempting when I haven't had a smoke in months &amp; resort to the "I've been good, a couple won't hurt."

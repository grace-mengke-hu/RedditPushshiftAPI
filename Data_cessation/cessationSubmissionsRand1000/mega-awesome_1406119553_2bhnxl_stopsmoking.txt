Not so ready to quit, but my dental work requires it :(

Hey everyone. So a bit of backgroud, I've been smoking 15-20 a day for the last 16 years.  Yesterday afternoon I found out that some painful and expensive dental work I had done recently is failing and will continue to fail if I keep smoking. So I had to quit.  I smoked 2 times since then, which... considering I wasn't quite ready to quit I think that is pretty good.

Anyone have any inspiration or horror stories about smoking and dental work?  I'm going to do this... I have to... just wasn't quite ready, but I sure as hell don't want my bone grafts & implants to fail :(

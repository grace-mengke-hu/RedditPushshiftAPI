My name is John and I will stop smoking today.

Today feels like a good day to stop smoking, it just does. This will be the second serious attempt to stop smoking, my first attempt ended when my grandfather passed away, I was clean for almost 5 months then I started smoking again. Today I will quit cold turkey, I found this subreddit and i wish to post my regular progress here. It's best to be with people with the same objective and we can help each other :) so here we go /r/stopsmoking. Day 1...

Edit1.- I should probably state that I smoke 8 cigs per day.

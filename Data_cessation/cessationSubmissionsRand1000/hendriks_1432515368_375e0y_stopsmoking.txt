You can't even start to imagine how grateful I am ...

I am so grateful for finding this sub and all your support. 

I used to smoke 24 cigarettes a day at 6.80 euro a pack. By quitting 309 days ago, I have saved over 2,100 euro! Enough for a long luxurious holiday. Also, not smoking 7,400 cigarettes at a quick 3 minutes each freed up 370 hours of my time. That is over 2 months of 8 hour workdays. TWO working months (no days off). I haven't even talked about how much happier and healthier I feel. Eat that nicotine addiction!

If you have just quit, or if you're thinking about it, please do it now! It's really worth it.

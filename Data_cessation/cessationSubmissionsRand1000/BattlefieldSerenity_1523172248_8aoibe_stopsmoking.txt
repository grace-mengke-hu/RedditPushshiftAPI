Reflections as I've got two days before my quit date

I set this quit date (4/9 is my last day smoking) on February 10th. There have been moments I have not wanted to quit. There have been times I have wanted to quit before.

But what I realized tonight is that I will never feel like I have smoked "enough". That's the thing about addiction - you've never actually satisfied.

I'm not going to use that as an excuse not to quit - quite the opposite, actually. Smoking will never satisfy me. It's very possible that all satisfaction in life comes as the satisfaction from a cigarette comes - fleetingly, and gone before you know it - but it's also possible that it isn't that way. 

The satisfaction which comes from smoking may satisfy me, but the downsides outweigh the benefits. The dissatisfaction from having damaged lungs and not being in shape drastically outweighs and outlasts the satisfaction of smoking. The $20,-$40,000 of after tax money I've spent on cigarettes drastically outweighs the satisfaction of a cigarette. 

The satisfaction of smelling good outweighs the satisfaction of a cigarette.

The satisfaction of having white teeth outweighs the satisfaction of having a cigarette. 

The satisfaction of not being shunned as a smoker outweighs the satisfaction of having a cigarette.

The satisfaction of not having as many allergies outweighs the satisfaction of having a cigarette. 

The satisfaction if getting a good night's sleep because my lungs and throat are healthy outweighs the satisfaction of having a cigarette.

The list goes on, but I won't. 

I've got Monday, my last day, set aside for reading Allen Carr's Easy Way. 

Tuesday may be tough, Wednesday may be tough, Thursday may be tough, and so on, but each day will get easier and I will start to feel satisfied from all of those things that smoking prevents.

I'll be posting on here more often. I'm sure I'll be needing you. Thanks for being a part of this.

Went for a run, calves hurt, now I cant breathe, day 30 rocks and sucks

It rocks cause I actually feel the difference in my lungs, man. Sometimes k get a quick urge out of nowhere, but they never do anything. When I smell cigarette smoke it smells like it did before I ever started. It doesn't smell like an orgasm in cloud form like it did on day 3, that's for sure. But back then it never read bothered me, its just a smell now. A piece of the scenery. 




Anyways, it sucks cause I know because I've done it for so long that my lungs will need extra time to recover. I'm certain the cardio is helping. I made my first 10 minute run in over two years tonight, which is huge even if my calves hate me and it took another 10 or 15 to catch my breath. There's just so much more damage for me left to undo. I'll just have to undo what I can day by day...




Also, I passed my final exam in programming 3 with 80% and idk where else to brag about that but I'm feeling pretty good. 





Anyways, if any of you need to reach out, please use this sub. Y'all's advising and encouragement have been invaluable thus far. I'd strongly recommend everyone where continue to communicate with each other. You're all doing great I believe in you all!!

Yay Guys!

So so proud of myself. The only thing I've done differently is join support groups like this one and a few on Facebook. I can't say it's just coincidence. Getting notifications from people all around the world telling me I can do it and how they did it and tips and tricks to help me. So thank you guys! 😁 I have only thought of cigarettes twice today. Once this afternoon and once when I decided to write this post.   Taking my life back!

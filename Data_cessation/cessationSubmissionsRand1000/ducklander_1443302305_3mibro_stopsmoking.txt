Fucking up is not the end.

 I quit smoking almost 500 days ago, and over the past few months I've moved cities and have become very lonely and drank a lot more to make friends. In the course of this. I started smoking cigarettes, beginning with a puff from a girl I was dating, and last night I must've had 4 cigarettes. Worst of all I was scrounging the patio for any opportunity to bum. 

Woke up with a terrible hangover and that nic-starved feeling I had when I used to smoke first thing in the morning. I refuse to slide back into dependence. I'm resetting the badge and going to stop smoking from now on. I regret every cig I smoked the past month and understand that there was nothing worthwhile about them.

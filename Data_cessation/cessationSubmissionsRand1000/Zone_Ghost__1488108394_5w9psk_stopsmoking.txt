100 days

No smoke no nicotine. Keep trying to quit if you're having a rough time with it, don't give up. I had to try many times over the past six to eight months, some were easy some were hard but this one sticked and that's all that matters.

I'm really glad I made it this far, I knew I would after having some bumps in the road, it gets easier after a few weeks even though at the time it can seem like it will last forever, it won't , just a few weeks or so. You can do it.

This sub really helped me, I would post and read here often. I don't think about smoking anymore as I understand deeply that it doesn't reduce stress, it isn't pleasurable and it won't give you anything other than addiction to it.

Good resources to quit are this sub, Alan Carr audiobook and whyquit videos on YouTube.

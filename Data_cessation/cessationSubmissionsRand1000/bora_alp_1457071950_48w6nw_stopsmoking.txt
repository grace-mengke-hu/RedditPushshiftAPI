Cause of my depression was smoking

Hello everyone, I was 4 days smoke free and I wasn't craving at all. But overall I was feeling a lot less stressed.

I know this might sound wrong but I wanted to experiment by buying a pack even though I didn't get any cravings. I smoked about 5 cigs in the last 2 days, didn't enjoy a single one. All they gave me was depression, hopelessness, stomach ache and a terrible headache.

They were the cause of my never-ending depression and all my health problems. I even felt hungrier as I smoked! I'm giving the pack to a smoker friend of mine today and never touching one ever again.

I cured all my problems by quitting smoking. So glad I made this decision.

Good luck all!

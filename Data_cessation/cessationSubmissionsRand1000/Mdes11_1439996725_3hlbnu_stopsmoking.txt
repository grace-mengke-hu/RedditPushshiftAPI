reward time !!!

My boyfriend and I quit together a few months ago. The day we quit smoking, we booked a vacation of hiking in the mountains and staying in a private log cabin (the vacation would be paid for with the money we saved from quitting smoking.) We both agreed that if either one of us smokes before our vacation, we have to cancel it. This has been amazing for both of us. It has truly been a great motivator because we were both dying to go on this vacation. Well, we leave tomorrow for a week of hiking and fresh air and we both feel amazing ! I'm so excited :) I recommend this way of quitting to everyone ! One cigarette really isn't worth cancelling something you're really looking forward to. Whenever I craved a smoke, I would go online and look at pictures of where we were going. Completely took away my craving. I'm proud of us :)

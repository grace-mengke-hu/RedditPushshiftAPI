Day 3, so far so good! This weekend will be like: LAAAAAANAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA DANGER-ZONE!!!!!!

Hi everyone!

Day 3 of not smoking so far! All i have so far are very short impulses for a few seconds like: "Hey lets smoke a cigarette"! No further extreme cravings or major attitude changes. I'm afraid to say that is going easy because i don't want to jinx my self or anyone else in this sub-reddit!

Tomorrow I will go to Hong Kong for 2 days and visit my brother! This will probably include slightly more alcohol than prescribed by my doctor, so i must be onpoint if it comes to staying focused on my goal!

I'm not nervous so far and I'm sure i can do this! 

And so can each and every single one of you guys!

Thank all of you so much for your support towards me and also towards each other! You guys are amazing!

Sincerely your(s), 

Butt.

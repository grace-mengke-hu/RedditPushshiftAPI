100 days nicotine free!

I feel so happy to be free of that terrible addiction. I feel young, vibrant and alive. 
The other day me and a friend were running to catch a bus. When we got to the stop, she was so winded she could barely speak, after only one block of running. I was perfectly fine, and I'm not even a runner. Yes, she is a smoker. 
I forgot what it's like to be chained down by that addiction. Not being able to run, coughing all day and night, smelling like shit, it's all so horrible. I'm free! I'M FREE!!!! 
Thank you, /r/stopsmoking for helping me to achieve this glorious milestone. Cheers to the milestones that are yet to come. <3 <3 <3 
And good luck with your quitting!

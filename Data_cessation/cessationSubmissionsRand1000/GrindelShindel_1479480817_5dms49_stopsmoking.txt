Cravings at my new work place

Quitting was pretty easy until today.
New workplace=new people.
You need to break the social ice. 
This process is strongly connected for me with smoking. 
I didn't give in the urge. 
I am going now my way home and the urge is vanishing slowly. This makes me feel very good.
Bros, if i can do this, so you can too! Stay strong!

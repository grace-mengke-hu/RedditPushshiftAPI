What gives you the thought that a smoke wouldn't be that bad?

Pushing 8 months since I quit for good, and I don't really have any major things that make me want to smoke.  I can hang out with my smoking friends and not want to smoke, I can be drunk and not want to smoke.  But for me, whenever I walk by an ashtray like outside a restaurant and see all those butts sticking out.  It kicks something off in my mind that 'Hey, a smoke wouldn't be bad right now."  I haven't given in, but that's what does it for me everytime.  

So my question is what makes you guys think that a smoke sounds like a good idea?


Edited: I haven't smoked.  Didn't proofread my original post....but I corrected it now.   :::embarassing:::

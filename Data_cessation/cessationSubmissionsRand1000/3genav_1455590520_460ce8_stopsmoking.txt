21M. Decided that I would finish the pack and quit cold turkey.

Just finished my last one, now time to quit. I smoked about 6 or 7 a day, way more when I'm drinking. Decided that it isn't worth the health risks and its getting to be too expensive for me.

What are some of the things you guys do to take your mind off the cravings?

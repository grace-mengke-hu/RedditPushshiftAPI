Update: I've never gone this long

Smoker for 5 years, nearly a full pack a day up until I quit. I feel outstanding right now! I've finally made it past a month (never have before). I've tried to quit multiple times... More than I can count on two hands. I've tried reading the Easy Way while smoking but this time I quit first and then started reading. I'm almost finished with my fourth time reading the book and highly recommend to anyone trying to quit. One cool thing I did was record myself smoking my last cigarette. I did this just in case I ever got drunk and was on the verge of caving in. I could then watch my past self talking to my present self saying how much I hated the position I was in while being a smoker. So far I haven't had to use it which is good. It's been extremely easy this time specifically because I KNOW I'm done, not just hoping I'm done.

Two Weeks!

"Birds flying high
You know how I feel
Sun in the sky
You know how I feel
Breeze driftin' on by
You know how I feel
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life
For me
And I'm feeling good
I'm feeling good"

Quote from the song "Feeling good" , which describes how I'm feeling after being 15 days smoke free!

God , i wished i would have made this decision a long time ago , or maybe never start smoking! 
Keep fighting the good fight peps , it pays of!

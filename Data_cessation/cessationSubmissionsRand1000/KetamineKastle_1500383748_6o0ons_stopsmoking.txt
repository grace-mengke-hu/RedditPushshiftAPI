For those that have quit cigs and weed.

Weed withdrawal has horrible withdrawal symptoms for me. But I have no cravings. I still keep smoking it to ward off withdrawals.

Tobacco is going soon.

Is tobacco more craving based then physical withdrawal symptoms? I'm gonna guess so considering how mild of a drug it is.

I'm kinda hoping so, I know tobacco is supposed to be harder to quit, so if the withdrawal symptoms are worse I don't know if mt hypochondriax mind could quit lol.

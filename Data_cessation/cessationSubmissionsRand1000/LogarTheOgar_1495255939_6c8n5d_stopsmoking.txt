They stink

Im at the bar. I haven't been in an actual bar since before my quit date. Everyone coming in from outside, from a cigarette...

They stink. Like I can't even talk to them. I was always told I never carries the smell of smoke with me but... holy shit I can't believe I never noticed how much it stank.

I was worried about drinking and smoking but oh man I think Im good.

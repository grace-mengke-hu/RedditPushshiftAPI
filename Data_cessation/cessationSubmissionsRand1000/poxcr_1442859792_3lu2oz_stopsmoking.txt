500 cigs not smoked!

As of today, I have not smoked 500 cigs (barely after one month). Hard to imagine how many cigs I used to smoke when I wasn't counting/caring. 

Still using an ecig at night when I get back home, however I've been using refills with progressively less nicotine. Sometimes this feels like cheating, but I hope it is just a transition.

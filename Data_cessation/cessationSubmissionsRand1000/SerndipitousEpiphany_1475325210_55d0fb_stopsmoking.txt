Yippee! 2 Weeks Smoke Free.

Today marks 14 days since I decided to give cigarettes the boot. Still have the odd trigger but they are much fewer and further between. More often than not now, it doesn't even cross my mind. I live with someone who still smokes (for now, fingers crossed) and I even go for a post-lunch walk with a friend who partakes as we take our stroll and in neither case does it really bother me. The difference between now, and past attempts was that in those kinds of situations I used to tell myself that I wanted a cigarette but couldn't have one. I'd get that crappy feeling in the pit of my stomach the whole time trying to deny myself what I wanted. But now, my mindset is that I don't want to smoke anymore, and when there is a trigger (a certain place, or time) I just remind myself that I'm already a non-smoker, super happy to be one and I'm planning on keeping it that way.

Aside from less coughing (almost none) in the morning, and my workouts being easier I STILL can't get over how much taste and smell I was missing with food. It's soooooo good! No wonder some people put on weight after quitting smoking! Being mindful though: got a beachside trip coming soon :)

If you're on /r/stopsmoking because you're trying to get up the courage to finally quit: I promise you've got nothing to lose except a smelly, money grubbing, health sucking jerk who pretends to be your friend! You can do it!

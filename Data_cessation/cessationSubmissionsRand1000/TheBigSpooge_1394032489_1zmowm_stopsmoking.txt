I just lost an excuse not to quit

So, I found out yesterday that I passed an exam that will allow me to drop a very time-consuming class.  I had been telling myself, “I’m a grad student and a TA; I literally do not have a single evening, weekend or morning that I can afford to spend nursing a headache or wallowing in lethargy.  I’ll quit this summer . . . or when I get tenure.”  

But now I sort of do have the time to do those things.  I’ve quit before; I know the drill.  Water, juice, self-talk, mints, gum, Tylenol, etc. etc. etc.  Now, I don’t think my lifestyle will allow me to go cold turkey (I don’t want to kill any of my students), so I’m going to try out the patches for the next couple months and commit to quitting all nicotine at the end of the semester.  Basically, I’m going to experiment with quitting for a while before I actually quit.  I have half of a pack left, which should hold me until tonight or midday tomorrow; after that, it’s just the patches . . . at least most of the time.

If you’re a regular on this subreddit, you might have noticed my ultra-negative posts here the past several days.  Well, along with the good news about the exam, I’ve also had a good talk with my therapist about “taking the good with the bad.”  So, as much as I roll my eyes at so much of the optimism here, I’m going to try to stay positive in the sense of rationally recognizing the good things I’m gaining rather than fixating on the bad things I’m experiencing.  

So you’ll probably be seeing a lot more of me around here as I pursue this experiment, and I’ll try not to be such a killjoy so much of the time (but I’ll still downvote your comment if you mention Allen Carr).

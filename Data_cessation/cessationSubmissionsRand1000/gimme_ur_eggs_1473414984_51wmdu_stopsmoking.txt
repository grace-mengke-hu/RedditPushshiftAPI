I find dipping all the ciggy filters in shit really helps me not want to smoke at all.

Here's the thing: sure, I can still smoke if I want to, but it'll mean I'll have shit in my mouth. I also made sure to use shit I found unflushed in a public toilet just to make it even more gross (semi-diarrhea on the side of the bowl)

I've tried everything - vape, patches, gum, spray, books (yes Alan Carrs' as well), but nothing has been as successful as this. And I feel great. Unorthodox, I know, but I highly recommend it.

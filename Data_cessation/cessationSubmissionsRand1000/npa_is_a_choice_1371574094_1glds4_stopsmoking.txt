Everyday you don't smoke is a triumph.

This is a little bit of a rant so I apologize. I feel great at 202 days. There are times when I forget that I was a smoker. It seems like a different life. When my bf and room mate go smoke, I hate the smell and no longer want to go out with them. Victory! Except when I'm at work. The stress is so bad some days that I fight to not go buy a pack. I don't do it because it is a slippery slope. I tell myself I just want one cigarette and then I'll just give the pack to someone. But that's not true. It's one cigarette here and then, hey what's two today? I've come too far to let a stupid job ruin such a great accomplishment. But today I'm eliminating some of that stress! I'm stepping down from my bullshit middle management job so I can have more time to pursue what I want. I know this won't be easy and I'm sure I will have more cravings, but I'm excited. I wish all you guys the best of luck!

TL;DR My job is unnecessarily stressful (other people's stupidity) and I almost blew my badge. But I stayed strong and so can you!!!!!!!!!!

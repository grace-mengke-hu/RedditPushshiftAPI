I want to stop

I have been smoking since my junior year of highschool. It's been about 6 years now and I'm up to a pack a day or more. I'm tired of wasting money and letting these nasty cigarettes control my life, it seems like I always want to smoke. After every meal, every shower, every time I get in the car, any excuse or reason I can find to light one up. I want to live a healthier life for myself and for my son. I'm afraid I'm not going to be strong enough to do it. Please help. Any advice, any support, anything please.

Alright I am ready!

I don't want to die of cancer. I don't want my duaghter to find my phone with my Reddit acount on it. What do I have to do. I have not been able to go a full day without smoking since my early 20's. I'm ready! 
My brain says, fuck it your going to die anyway you might as well continue to smoke so how to I do this thing?

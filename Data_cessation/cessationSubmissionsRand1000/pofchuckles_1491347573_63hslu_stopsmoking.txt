It might seem a little arrogant but i'm really really bored at work and have nothing to do for 5 hours and I can remember when I was quitting I used to lurk here looking for tips or advice. So i'm a 302 day smoke free guy. I used to smoke 30 a day and I smoked for 9 years. I quit cold turkey after not trying to quit at all for at least 3 years. If you want a chat send me a message and no problem.

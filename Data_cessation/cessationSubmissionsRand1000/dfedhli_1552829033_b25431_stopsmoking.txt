Guys, I'm doing it. Two weeks!

I quit cigarettes with the help of a vape and two weeks ago I put the vape down and reset my badge. It's not as hard as I'd imagined. That's not to say it's easy. But I feel emotionally much better - gone is the dance between withdrawal and satisfaction. My mood swings are less. I don't have to find time and a place to smoke. Being free from that is so nice.

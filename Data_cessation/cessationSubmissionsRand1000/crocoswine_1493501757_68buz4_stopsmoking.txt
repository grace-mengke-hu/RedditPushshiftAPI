A stupid craving that just won't quit

I'm stuck inside alone on a beautiful day today writing a final paper for my final class of the school year.  Finals used to mean frequent (procrastination) breaks stretching my legs on my front stoop chain smoking with my roommates.  I know the science behind taking frequent study breaks, but I just don't have the motivation, because damn do I want my break to be a smoke break today.  Not that not taking breaks is helping me write faster - I'm just staring at my computer thinking about how nice a puff would be.

I won't smoke with you guys today, but just needed to get it off my chest that it's gonna be a tough one.  The cravings are a lie, and this is just an emotional tie that caught me off guard.  I got this.

It will be my millionth attemp...

....and last.

You know what? I'll tell you something. I quit nicotine once for almost 5 months and it was something awesome. I felt way better than now, had better sleep and felt better on every meeting with friends. I could focus on conversation, not on my shitty cravings. Being a slave of something is not a thing i love and it's time to say finally good bye to it. I want to quit becouse I know now, how I was being a non-smoker and how am I now. I want to quit becouse:

-I dont deserve to be slave of anything

-I can't admit to anyone that im in addiction again

-I ate better after I quit, now I eat irregularly

-I've had enough of all my nicotine headaches

-I want to be proud of myself

-I am pretty scared of cancer

And more and more. There is a long list of things that will be more beautiful after you stop doing this ugly shit. And good thing is to find your own. I am ready to give up smoking forever, and I promiss you, /r/stopsmoking it's my time to do it and I won't let you down. So if you read this, it means I am non-smoker.


Btw, sorry for my english. I have tried my best.

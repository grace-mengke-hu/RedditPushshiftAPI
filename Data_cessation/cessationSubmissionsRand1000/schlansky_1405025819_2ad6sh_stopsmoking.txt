36 hours without nicotine

Feeling good. Had 3 cups of coffee for breakfast (extreme trigger). 2 beer in a bar full of smokers (ultimative trigger) - didnÂ´t smoke and could handle my cravings surprisingly well.

The thought of smoking comes at times. I understand the feeling, its triggers and the mechanisms of my addiction, so I am happy to say that I feel pretty good about myself, my decision and the first hours of my new life :D

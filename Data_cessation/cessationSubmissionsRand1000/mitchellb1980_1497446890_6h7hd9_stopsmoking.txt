I had my last smoke, believe me when I say I had ups and downs at the start, quitting smoking was easy, dealing with 17 years of ignoring how to deal with emotions and anxiety and panic,, basically "adulting" was hard

But to any of you just starting out let me tell you this, smoking never did anything good for you, you too can quit, it doesn't have ot be hard. There is nothing that will set me back down that path again, there is NO SUCH THING as one smoke, one drag even, even 2 years free of it, I know this. that thought process is a lie. Now it's just a matter of never smoking again.

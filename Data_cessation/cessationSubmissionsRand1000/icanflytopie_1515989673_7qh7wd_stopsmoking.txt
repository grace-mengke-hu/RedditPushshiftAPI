Whenever I drink I crave like no other

I can go a month + without smoking but as soon as I drink, especially at a bar I crave like no other, rationalize &amp; smoke. Damnit. I’m 22, too &amp; don’t want to be like my father who has been a slave his whole life. But being in college, it’s near impossible to stay away from one or the other.... how do I start a streak on here?

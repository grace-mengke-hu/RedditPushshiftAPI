My first normal cold

So this is what a normal cold feels like. This is why other people used to be able to get on with their lives with a cold while I was stuck at home coughing myself to death for two weeks plus.  I've had a cold all week and feel pretty shitty with it as you would expect and have the usual scratching as at the back of my throat but it is not keeping me awake at night, it hasn't gone to my chest, I haven't had to take time off sick. The common cold is no longer something I need to fear!! Anyone else found this?

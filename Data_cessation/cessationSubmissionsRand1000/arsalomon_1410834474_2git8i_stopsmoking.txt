Will it get easier?

I just hit the 1 week mark yesterday and these last two days have been absolutely awful. I've been using my e-cig but my cravings have been relentless and stronger than ever the last couple days. I've been in a shitty mood, I almost feel depressed, and all I can think about is lighting up a real cigarette. Please tell me it gets easier. I'm even using an e-cig and this is hell.

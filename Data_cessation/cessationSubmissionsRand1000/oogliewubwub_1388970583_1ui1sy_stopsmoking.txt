End of Day Five. FIVE!!

I am so proud of myself. 
I honestly already can feel a difference in my abilities to do physical activity. We are currently dealing with what has just been upgraded to a blizzard and I was out shoveling earlier - THEN took my Newfie for a walk around the neighborhood.  I never had to stop to catch my breath and I felt GREAT.

I can't wait to get through 30 days.  Then I am going to take up yoga. In the Spring, jogging. 2014 is going to be MY YEAR.

Five days down!

And made it through my Friday night shift at work with no cravings!  Even the drive home it’s just a small thought in the back of my mind.  Also not going to the gas station every day is really helping my bank account.  Not only would I buy cigarettes but usually a drink and a snack too....so not unusual for me to spend between 11 and 20 bucks a day.  My lungs and chest don’t hurt anymore.  I used to get headaches on almost a daily basis and haven’t needed my migraine shot since Sunday.  I usually go through about 24 shots a month.  No issues with hunger or munchies either.  Got back on keto eating and that’s really helped curb the hunger.  So far so good!

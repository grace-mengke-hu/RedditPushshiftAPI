Whatever comes next, it will be without cigarettes.

I'm about to smoke my last ever cigarette. Whatever will come at me next, I will experience it as a non smoker now.

Maybe some guys remember me from my last post, submitted with my other account. (https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/5vur1r/ocd_about_numbers_is_ruining_my_life_on_the_verge/) I have suffered from heavy OCD for years now, related to unlucky numbers/dates for me personally. I won't go into much detail as I already posted everything about my struggles in my previous post here, but my OCD brain thinks there are unlucky dates, related to the "unlucky" numbers which control my OCD, on which I can't quit smoking cigs/weed. I picked today to quit, because it isn't an unlucky date for me so I can feel comfortable the about the quit date for starting my new life.

I feel this is a golden opportunity to conquer my addictions, and OCD, which seem to be related. I feel excited to battle the upcoming, without doubt, challenging days and months, which will result in me becoming the person I have always dreamed of becoming.

Posted this to hold myself accountable. Good luck fellow non smokers. ðŸ¤˜

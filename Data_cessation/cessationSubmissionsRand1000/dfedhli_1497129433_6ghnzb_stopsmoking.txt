Made it to 14 days!

I haven't touched a cigarette in two weeks. I had a super stressful day on Thursday but I didn't smoke. Today I went out with a friend who smokes and I didn't smoke. Today it started to get easier. The cravings are still there but they are lessened.

I also have an e-cigarette as a crutch. I'm at 8mg right now and I'll taper down to 0mg and then wean off. I had done this once before with good success (and relapsed because of "just one" - no such thing).

Today my e-cigarette started to satisfy me again for the first time in these two weeks. I expect the satisfaction to go up at which point I'll drop to 6mg.

Thanks for all your help!

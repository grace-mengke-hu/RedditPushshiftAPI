I was a serial quitter who quit for good 1 year ago. Here's what I've learned. I hope It can help and motivate someone else

Like I said, I quit smoking cigarettes a year ago. I have no idea how many times I've relapsed after 3 or 4 days. I just couldn't be stronger than cigarettes and would always give into "just one". Well, we all know how that goes.  It seemed like I'd never give it up for good.

But let's go over exactly what I've given up. Nothing. I've given up nothing. Because that's what cigarettes do for you:  nothing. They don't relieve stress. They create it. Nicotine withdrawal is stressful. You're not saying goodbye to a friend. You're just going to poison yourself anymore. 

Now there actually is ONE thing that a cigarette will do for you. It will make sure that you want to smoke another cigarette later on. That's it!  That's the trick behind nicotine. THE URGE TO SMOKE WILL GO AWAY WHETHER YOU SMOKE OR NOT!  The only difference is that if you smoke, tomorrow is day 1 again. I'm tired of day 1's. I've had a million day 1's and they all sucked. 

I failed a million times because I was always trying to be stronger than cigarettes. I'm not  stronger than them. Be honest, you're probably not either. I quit because I'm smarter than cigarettes. So are you. So is everyone here. 

Things that really helped me werethis sub reddit, Allen Carr's Easy Way to Quit Smoking, and watching Joel Spitzer videos on YouTube and whyquit.com

Moving onto day 6 now.

Starting on day 6. I find that I am having more time for the things that I want to do, and the things I need to do as well. I think part of my success though should be attributed to my job. I've been working 10 hour days for the past 3 and have one more for tonight. I should note though that I am starting to get into the groove on this and will probably discontinue this daily update down to when I feel I need to come in and say something. I say daily even though I missed yesterday, I was pretty exhausted and nothing really happened. I have found that I have been a little edgy as of late. Little things have pushed me to a close encounter with my anger. Close, but I have managed to keep it in check and just come off as irritable and short. Other then that, everything seems to be moving along swimmingly. I intend to get back into the gym next week. Start rebuilding my body again and build it up better than it was before. Lastly, before I part for the night for work, I want to thank all those who have been sending me messages and encouragement. I have gone to friends in the past for help and encouragement, but hearing it from people who are doing the same thing I am and pushing so hard to become better just like me helps all the more. Thank you.

Get Your "First" Out of the Way...

I'm learning that one of the best motivators to quitting is to experience a lot of "firsts".  What I mean is that I feel much stronger when I successfully beat the urge to smoke for the first time in a situation where I would normally light up.  


For example...  


I always smoked while going out to a bar.  The urges subsided after I defeated the craving on my first time out.  I would smoke during commercial breaks during The Walking Dead.  Last night... no cigarettes and it felt great!  My son (who has autism) suffers frequent meltdowns which take a great deal of control and patience from my wife and I.  Sometimes the meltdowns will last for a couple hours.  During this time we are keeping him safe, trying to calm him, and avoiding the punches, kicks, biting, and head butting.  I almost always would go out to smoke after he was calm again, but I have helped him through several of these episodes without smoking afterwards.


Has anyone else experienced the satisfaction of getting your "first ________" out of the way during your quit attempt?  (Fill in the blank with your trigger that you beat).


Who's gonna join me in not smoking today?

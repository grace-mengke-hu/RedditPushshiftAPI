a long strange trip with cigarettes

hello my brother told me about this site so i just wanted to post and add some support from the reddit stopsmoking community as i embark on yet another quitting quest. a little background prob not too dissimilar from others: started smoking at 19 (casually LOL), now 35 years old; at the height of my smoking (mid 20's) i smoked 3 packs a week. i quit for over a year in 2013 when my son was born. here's where it gets intriguing and where i need help/support! for over a year now, i've 'quit' almost EVERY DAY!!! i wake up for work, go to gas station, buy a pack, smoke 3-5 cigs, then give them away or leave them on the street. the desire to quit is huge within me (not huge enough i guess!) but i can't get over this morning compulsion and it's driving me nuts. to me there are no replacements; i'm pretty knowledgeable about medicinal herbs and i've tried them all; tinctures, chewing calymus root, teas etc. for the rest of the day (most days!) i'm fine, but this AM thing is driving me crazy and making me think i am. any advice from the stopsmoking community is appreciated.

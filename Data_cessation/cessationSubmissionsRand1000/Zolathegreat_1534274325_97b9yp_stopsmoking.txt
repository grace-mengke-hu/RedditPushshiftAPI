Had a craving today. I resisted.

I was out with a friend. He is a smoker. All of a sudden, an urge hit me. I wanted to smoke badly. What kept me from doing it is the fact that there is never just one cigarette. I knew that if I smoke one, I will be a smoker again. So I didn't. This story speaks of an importance of education. I tried many times to quit and I would have just one after some time. I won't make the same mistake I did last time.

35 days in and feeling weak?!

What is happening?! I mean I know I wasnt out of the woods yet regarding cravings and all that... But I am feeling so jittery and like I really just want to go outside and smoke. I haven't felt like this since those first few miserable days. Thankfully I would have to walk all the way to the gas station to even get cigarettes and my baby is sleeping on me, meaning I won't be getting any.. 

But I just really want to smoke right now. Really, really want to. Ugh.

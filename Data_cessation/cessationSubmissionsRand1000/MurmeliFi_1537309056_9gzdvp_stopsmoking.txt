This has certainly been an interesting journey so far!

Side effects of quitting have surprised me. Luckily depression is gone and didn't last for a long time. Hopefully it stays away too. 

But fatigue continues, holy s... And these weird "pimples" on my face are not cute. Hopefully they don't go all wild and became acne or something. 

I'm also itching all the time and it's driving me crazy. 😝 

BUT I'm staying positive; my body is healing and cleaning itself and causing some discomfort while doing that. Everything will eventually pass and it is worth this. 

I used to think nicotine craving was the only side effect when quitting. 🤔😅 But I haven't really been craving during these 17 days. If I've wanted to smoke, I have rationalized it; I don't want to smoke, I just want to escape the situation like I used to do before. I think this is making us stronger individuals because we have to handle our emotions and come up with new techniques to survive stressful situations etc. 

What has been your worst side effect so far?

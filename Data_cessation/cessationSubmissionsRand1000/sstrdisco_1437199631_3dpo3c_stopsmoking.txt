Days 84 & 85 sucked.

I spent said days feeling more like it was day 2 or 3 of not smoking. It seems strange to have gotten this far and then felt like that. It was bad enough I cried, I was very flighty and unable to pay attention, etc. an so on. Today was a fraction of how I'd been feeling, which leads me to believe that tomorrow will be fine.

I am so glad and thankful that this sub is here for those moments. My peers gave me great advice and just supported me. Thank you. I appreciate all of you so much. Here's to not smoking!

132 days, hardly a thought of a smoking till this Spring trigger. It will pass.

Hi all you wonderful people. I love not smoking. It's been 132 days. Challenging for the first few days and weeks, I would check in here and then get on with my day. I knew in advance that Spring would be a trigger for me, and yep, it is. Woke up in the middle of the night thinking about work, thinking how I used to go out for a smoke. Spring weather has been my downfall before. Not this time, I guarantee it. Just checking in because it cements my resolve. Best wishes on your journey. This is so done. Done, done, done.

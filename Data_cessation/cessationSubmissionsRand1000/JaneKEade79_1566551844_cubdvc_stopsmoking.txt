6 Days Smoke Free

The speed in which my body is recovering since I stopped smoking is amazing. I have so much more energy now. Breathing is so much easier. I'm sleeping so much better. Food tastes amazing and I don't feel so stressed. Another thing I've noticed is my circulation is better and that I feel much warmer. My hands are warmer and sometimes I get quite hot like I'm having a hot flush. Overall, I feel so much healthier and I'm loving the new me as a non-smoker. I had an induction at the gym yesterday and will be starting sessions there on the 2nd September. I'm really looking forward to it 🏋️‍♀️🏋️‍♀️🏋️‍♀️🏊‍♀️🏊‍♀️🏊‍♀️🚴‍♀️🚴‍♀️🚴‍♀️😁😁😁

Going to be tested this weekend

It's been month...an entire month. Unbelievable really. But now I'm off to Austin City Limits with a buddy of mine. Thursday and Friday night, partying like rockstars. I haven't really partied since I quit so it's just been me. I know smoking weed will help, which I know I will do a lot of. Just hoping that my drunk self doesn't feel so confident that I can just bum a smoke.

Why doesn't vape/patch/other fix the cravings?

I suppose there's a million chemicals in cigarette smoke, far beyond the nicotine. 

A big issue I have is hand movement. I have found cig-a-likes that I enjoy, and they work enough that I can get nicotine sick if I vape them too much, but it still doesn't satisfy that itch. 

If you were to continue vaping, would the itch for real smoke go away?

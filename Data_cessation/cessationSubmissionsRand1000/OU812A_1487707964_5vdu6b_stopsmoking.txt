Relapsed for the 3rd time in 40 days

Stopped taking Welbutrin because it was messing with my sleep, giving me insomnia.

I was doing great for the past 40 days, mostly - even though I had 2 relapses (2-3 sigs smoked on different weekends) - still, much better than I did in years. This past weekend, right after I remarked how wonderful the air smelled on a gorgeous sunny day, that same day, about 1 hour later I took a cig from my buddy... and later that day, after my STBX argued with me, I took another.... and later that night I had few drinks and bought a pack and smoked few more. And few more next day...

So, about 8 sigs in 3 days. Well below my old average, but a relapse nonetheless. Sigh... f*ck this habit and my weakness. 

Today, I'm feeling familiar chest pangs, shortness of breath, and enormous weight back on my shoulders. I failed yet again. However, I'm not giving up on giving up smoking. Today, I've been smoke free, sticking to lozenges. 

Stripped my badge off, here we go again. :(

Today I want to keep a promise to myself not to smoke.

My quit smoking app has daily "missions".  Saturday's was to promise myself (and another person) in writing to never smoke again.  I found the prospect of promising such a thing so daunting that I didn't do it.  Never is a long fucking time and I'm not confident at all that I can achieve Never, but I can try and I AM confident that I can achieve today.  

I also only did a half ass job on yesterday's mission.  I was supposed to come here and try to help three people who are just starting out.  I wrote to one person (and hope it helped).  I just couldn't bring myself to do more on account of being in a bad head space.  I am gonna work on being in a better head space today.

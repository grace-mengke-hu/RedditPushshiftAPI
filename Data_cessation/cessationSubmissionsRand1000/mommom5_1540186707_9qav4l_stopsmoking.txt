An acquaintance lit a cigarette in front of me and smoked... ðŸ˜‘

Since I quit, Iâ€™ve avoided quite a bit and have not been around any smokers.  In my family and group of close friends, I was the only smoker so itâ€™s been easy staying away from it fir the most part.  But this weekend, I ran into an acquaintance who smokes and  Iâ€™m not going to lie, Iâ€™m 6 weeks into my quit and as I stood there talking to him I was having an inner conversation with myself.  I still thought it smelled good, I was remembering how it felt to smoke after having to hold off and finally lighting up... again thinking it smelled good.  Then I thought about why I was quitting and so Iâ€™m still not smoking.  After smoking 29 years, and 6 weeks into this quit (because Iâ€™ve had plenty of quit attempts in those smoking years), Iâ€™m still having my struggles.  I can only say with each of my failed attempts, Iâ€™m hoping Iâ€™ve prepared myself to keep going.  This weekend I made it thru where I know in the past, that situation would have sent me to the gas station to buy a pack.  

I think this weekend, my lungs are celebrating my pure determination to be a non-smoker.  I just hope it gets easier soon.  

Moving on to another week smoke free!

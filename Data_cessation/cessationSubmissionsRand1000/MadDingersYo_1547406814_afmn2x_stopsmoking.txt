I'm at 14 hours and around this time is usually when I cave. First post here too, by the way. Send me a mantra!

I used /r/stopdrinking and I've been sober for almost 6 years now. I used to check it every day, it was like having a meeting in my pocket. 

Hoping this place can be similar! Any mantras to help keep you from picking up?

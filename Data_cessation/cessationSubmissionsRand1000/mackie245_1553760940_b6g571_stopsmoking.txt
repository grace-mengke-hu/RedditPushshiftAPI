What is the weirdest side effect that you have experienced from champix?

Hi all, glad I found such an awesome support group! 
I am a 29 yo female that smokes around 5-10 cigarettes per day for 10 years 
I’ve had my battles with trying to quit 

I’ve tried champix on and off and I notice that along with the nightmares, I’ve started wetting the bed!

Can anyone else share their weird experiences or side effects with champix?!

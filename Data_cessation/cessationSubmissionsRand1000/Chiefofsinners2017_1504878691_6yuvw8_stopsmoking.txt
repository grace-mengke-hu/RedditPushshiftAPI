Did I f--k up?

I'd gone 38 days without touching a cigarette.  Just now I went to a boozy lunch with a smoker and, though I resisted it for as long as possible, by the end I was tipsy enough that I asked for a smoke. I didn't really smoke it: I just took the *first* and *last* puff and otherwise just held the damn thing in my fingers.

What do you think? Did I break the quit? Will have to start all over?

Smoke Free for 300 Hours

Had many many weak moments. Biggest when my smoke buddy lighted up in front of me while I was at less than 200 hours smoke-free. I could resist & without flinching!

So all you smokers out there, its worth it in the end.

I have saved money too. Planning to buy a DSLR in 6 months with all the savings to gift my father!

Starting morning brisk walk from tomorrow. Will it help reduce cravings?

I was overweight as such, so excercise is long overdue anyway!

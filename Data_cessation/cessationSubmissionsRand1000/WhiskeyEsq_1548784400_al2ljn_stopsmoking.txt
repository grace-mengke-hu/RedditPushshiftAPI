Turned 31 today. My thirties are still cigarette free!

I'm a little over a year into my quit. After starting around age 19, one of the impetus that really helped get me to stick to it was the fact that I didn't want to still be a smoker at thirty-years-old. So I quit a month or so before then. Today I'm 31 and 414 days smoke  free. Just pumped to have come this far. Stick with it folks. Each day is a battle, but each day gets easier.

31 days... Cravings vs. Irratability?

Just hit 31 days... it's going great.  I don't have a ton of cravings anymore, except when I have a beer.

BUT... I feel so irritable and my relationships are suffering.  Anyone have similar experiences? I talked to someone who still had these rage feelings at 90 days... I am worried I think my wife will leave me by 90 days if I'm still like this!!!  (Not seriously, but seriously I just want to be more relaxed...)

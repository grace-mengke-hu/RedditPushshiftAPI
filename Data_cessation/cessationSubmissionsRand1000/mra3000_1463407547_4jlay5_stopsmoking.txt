Monday trigger

Well it's Monday and I'm on my day 3 now... already I'm noticing how much better I feel. I had some chest tightening the past two days and now it seems to have gone away. I also just passed a big trigger moment - the start of the workday (and the first moment when my family is not around who I would not smoke in front of). So, I used to smoke with my coffee outside and flip through stuff on my phone. I knew this trigger was coming and I planned ahead for what I would do (take a hot shower instead). Lots of deep breaths too and many glasses of water. As I was under the shower I thought of the benefits I have now that I am not smoking:

* more money
* more time (I smoked about 10-15 a day, so at 5 mins a smoke that's about an hour of extra time per day!)
* not worrying that my clothes will stink
* not feeling guilty 
* not feeling self conscious that someone will see me smoking
* more energy 
* more focus, less distracted about my next opportunity to feed the beast
* feeling honest with myself

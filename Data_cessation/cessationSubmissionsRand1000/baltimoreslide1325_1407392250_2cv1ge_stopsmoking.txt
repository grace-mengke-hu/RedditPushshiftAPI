Smoked while drinking 2ce in the last week

...but haven't craved them the day after at all. But still kind of feel like shit the day after from smoking, of course, so want to just stop doing that. And, it's probably the danger zone, even though it totally doesn't feel like it (since I never crave them anymore other than after 2+ drinks). Any advice?

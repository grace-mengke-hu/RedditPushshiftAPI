What I love about being a nonsmoker :)

I love that my clothes, fingers, hair, and breath smell clean all day, every day. 

In a house full of smokers, I love walking into my bedroom and smelling a burning candle and fresh air, rather than smoke. And I love that my chainsmoking family is jealous of my clean-smelling room, despite not admitting to it. 

I love that when I'm sitting in class, or eating, or talking to a friend, no matter what I'm doing, I'm not smoking or wanting to smoke. 

I love that I no longer experience the panic of 'but I'm almost out of cigarettes!' 

I love that one of my favorite hobbies, singing, has returned to me in full force, and continues to improve. I can reach high notes I haven't been able to sing in forever. 

I love knowing that I don't receive the judgments and pity that smokers receive by never-smokers. 

Most importantly, I love knowing that every day, my heart, lungs, and every other part of my body is healing and getting stronger. I love knowing that quitting so young will reduce my risk of lung cancer to almost none. 


And I love you guys. Best subreddit ever. :) 
Hooray for 3 weeks!

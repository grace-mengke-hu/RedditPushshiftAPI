Help! Need to solve a quitter's dilemma

Hey everyone!

I'm on what feels like my millionth quit, but I'd really like this one to stick. I'm just about to enter day 7 and I feel great: I'm sleeping properly for the first time in ages, and generally feel healthier and happier than I have in the past few months of smoking (24F, 10 years smoking, last 2 on and off - constant for March - May). 

Here's the problem: I'm taking care of my parents house at the moment, and have used this as an opportunity to quit. I'm finishing off an MSc and should really try and head back to my place soon as when I'm here I have little to do and low motivation to work or excercise (I usually climb with friends - can't do that here).

"So move back to your place!" you say. I think that's what I'm going to do as I know this would help me get back to exercise, socialising and productivity. The problem is my place is a miserable shithole that I hate living in (I am poor) and two of my housemates smoke. Our house constantly smells of cigarettes, there are ashtrays and lighters everywhere and also cigarettes that have been abandoned and left lying around quite often. Just typing this is making me want to smoke and this living situation is a large part of why my quit has been messed up for the past year. 

I am houseviewing tonight with the intention of moving out at the end of this month, but I still have to survive two weeks in the house at the beginning of a quit and I'm worried about that. Looking for advice for people who've survived the same thing!

TDLR:

Do I...

A) Remain in a smoke-free, lovely home to sustain my quit for a few weeks but miss out on socialising and exercise and likely get very little done 

OR

B) Return to my place after 10 days of no-smoking to a house I hate with two smokers and cigarettes everywhere for 2 weeks on the basis that I can socialise, get work done and exercise. 

Thanks everyone!

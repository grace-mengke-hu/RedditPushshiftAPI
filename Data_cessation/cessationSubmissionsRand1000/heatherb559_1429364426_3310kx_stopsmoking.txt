And I made it!!! Wonders never cease!!!

This is the first time my body has been free of nicotine in over 20 years. It feels pretty freaking amazing! 

A word on NRT

I used the patch because I felt like I couldn't abuse it. Also, because I have abused every other form of NRT in the past. Why I felt NRT was necessary for me. I was consuming what is considered lethal doses of nicotine daily. I had been hospitalized twice with hyper ventricular tachycardia due to the nicotine I was ingesting. I decided I needed to drop it down in notches. The strongest patch available wasn't strong enough to ward off the panic attacks and all the rest. I can't imagine how terrible it would have been to go cold turkey at that point. 

When I stepped down to the step 2 patch all the cravings came back. I sweated a patch off at work and it was obvious to me that the junky was alive and well and needing a fix. And that was it for me. If I was going to go thru all this again it would be for the last time. 

And here I am... On the other side where the grass is definitely greener!! A butterfly :)

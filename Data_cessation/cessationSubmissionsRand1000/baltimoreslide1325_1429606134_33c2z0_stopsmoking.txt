2 weeks -- longest I've ever made it

Two weeks today! This is the longest I've ever made it without a single puff. I've made it 7, 8, 11, 12 days many times, but not 14. I learned a ton from those mistakes and I think I am out for good now.  
I was out this evening with friends who chain smoke outside while we all play music. I used to smoke with them, and have relapsed in the past in their company. Tonight, I felt a tiny crave-pang when I first sat down with them. But after quitting and relapsing many times, I've taught myself that at the 2 week point a cigarette will taste like shit and make me feel like shit immediately. I've taught myself that to smoke at this point would just ruin my night by making me sick.  The crave went away after maybe a minute and it wasn't until I got home 5 hours later that I realized I hadn't even thought of smoking a cigarette the whole rest of the night. Even though everyone was smoking around me. ??!! Woah!  That was unimaginable a very short time ago.  
   
One experience that's underpinning my quit this time is something that happened about 3 weeks ago. I was out at a bar where I like to dance and a very good lead grabbed me to dance with him. Rare treat! Most guys suck at leading around here. And it was fast, really good music. I love to dance. The song was long, and we were really stomping; the band kind of extended the song, too, since we were really dancing hard. By the middle of the song I felt myself really short of breath though otherwise could have kept going all night. Being short of breath was actually distracting me from dancing. I was trying to hide that I couldn't breathe well. It pissed me the hell off and was embarrassing. Something about this was visceral enough to really serve as a deterrent for me these last weeks.  
  
Anyway, can't wait to see what this feels like after a month! First week quitters: it really gets easier. So many thanks to this sub and many people here for support, and good luck to all!

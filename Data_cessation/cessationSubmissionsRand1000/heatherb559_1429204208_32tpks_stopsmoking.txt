Resetting my badge!

So I finally took off my patch and gave up nicotine. This quit has always been more about my hardcore abuse of nicotine and less about smoking. The truth of the matter is that I've never cared what form my nicotine came in so long as I had it. Freedom is almost here!!! And it already feels sooo good!
While I'm proud of the 47 days I have been smoke free. The last 2 nicotine free mean so much more to me.

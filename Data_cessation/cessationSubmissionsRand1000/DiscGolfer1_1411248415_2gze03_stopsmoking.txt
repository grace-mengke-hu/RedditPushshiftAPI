Kinda good/kinda bad

15 days no smoking today! Woohoo! With that being said, smoked a cigar with my dad last night after a few drinks. Seeing as how I was drinking, I was kinda craving a cig also. Smoking the cigar didn't fulfill that cigarette craving I was having and didn't even really like it. Kinda bad cause I still smoked, kinda good cause I didn't like it so won't be "cheating" with a stogie very often.

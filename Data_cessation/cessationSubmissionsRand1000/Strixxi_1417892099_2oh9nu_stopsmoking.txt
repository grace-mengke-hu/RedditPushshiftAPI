I'm happy today!!

What a good feeling this is! It's the first morning all week that I feel clear-headed and alert. The only thought of nicotine so far today has been "wow I don't feel like I need to reach for it for once." 

I know there will be more lows but this is great. It's finally getting easier and I feel much less low than I was feeling yesterday. 

I made it through a pretty big test too. Car got stuck in the middle of the road for about an hour yesterday, on my way to a final exam that I was already late for. Thank goodness it was a class I excel in because the remaining hour (once I got to school) was enough to finish. Plus, despite my epic towering rage at the circumstance, I didn't smoke (*or get nicotine)!

Now for another test today. My sister's work Christmas party. I don't do well in social situations where I am the odd woman out, or in situation when I have no escape. I don't know anyone at this party and my sister is driving. So today will be the first time I face this social anxiety without a crutch. Not sure yet if I am going to drink or not :/

How's  everyone else today? My time buddies? You guys still going strong?

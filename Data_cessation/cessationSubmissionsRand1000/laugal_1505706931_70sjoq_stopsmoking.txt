Goal was to be smoke free at 30 and I did it.

Just turned 30 and hit two months and it feels awesome. I think the best thing is how all my smoker friends are constantly telling me about their quit plans and/it how they're not really addicted (only weekends, when they drink, only at night, etc). Being free and hearing all these things you really realize how fucked it is to smoke. It makes no sense. Granted it did take many failed quits to get here. But if I were to give any advice it would be to practice. Practice doing the things you always did while smoking but without. Don't make it that you're deprived of a smoke but rather you're reprogramming yourself. Practice having drinks right away or whatever it may be. For me I'm a violinist and smoking was synonymous with practice. Other failed quits I quit practicing for a while but this time I just didnt care, I just didn't smoke. I feel that practicing and relearning habits helps alot with the unexpected triggers along the way. There is nothing to miss. Smoking is fucked.

So twice I've gone with friends to this bar that they smoke in and I mean it is really really smokey. Twice I felt so dizzy and delirious and one time my chest even hurt like badly tight. New sensation, freaked me out. Any idea what that could be? An I suddenly allergic to cigs? I can't even go in there. There are other non smokers but no one else seems bothered.

Always SO hungry, just can't stop wanting to eat. Does this insatiable hunger ever go away?

I've quit for a couple of days now. Don't really feel like smoking again, but I'm eating so damn much. For those who have gone through this before - how long did this last for you? Please tell me your appetite went back to normal eventually! 

Thanks ;)

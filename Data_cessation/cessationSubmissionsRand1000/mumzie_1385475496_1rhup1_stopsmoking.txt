Day three: Switched it up and it is hot tea and crackers:)

Thought I would share a funny story from last night.  
We had company over and and I was getting irritable for absolutely no reason. I recognized this for what it was. So when I got asked what was wrong, I pointed at a bar stool we have, looked at them with all sincerity and said " I am very mad at that chair." Everyone looked at me funny and then started laughing.  
It broke the ice, they were not walking on egg shells around me, nor was I setting there seething mad for absolutely no reason at all.  It may sound silly, but instead of being aggravated at live things, I spent a great amount of time last night aggravated with my various appliances and furniture. This in turn made this aggravation just seem even sillier and I awoke this morning in a pretty dang good mood:)  
For those that remember Steve Martin in "The Jerk", the scene where the guy is shooting at the cans? Yep... "He hates these cans!" LOL

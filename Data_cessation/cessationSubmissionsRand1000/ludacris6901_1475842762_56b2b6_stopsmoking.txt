Relapses

Hi all first time poster here. I recently quit cold turkey after weeks of build up. I read articles, this sub, got the stop smoking app etc... I was super gung ho about it and successfully quit for 6 days. It felt great but i always end up going back as soon as things start to get easier. I have quit cold turkey multiple times. Some much longer. Once for an entire year. What gives? I knew i shouldn't have had "just one" but here i am with a new pack. How do you stay quit? Tips?

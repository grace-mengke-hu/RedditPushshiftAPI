3 weeks smoke free

Well, it's been 3 weeks already. Not a single puff so far. I'm using an ecig, though, however I stepped down the nicotine about a week ago. I only vape at night when I get home from work, and on the weekends when I go out.

I will probably step the nic down even further next week. Let's see how it goes. It hasn't been as hard as I expected.

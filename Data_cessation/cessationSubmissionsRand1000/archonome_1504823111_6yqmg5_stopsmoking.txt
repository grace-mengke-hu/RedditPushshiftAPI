Damn...I was so close to relapsing. Motivation needed

I got the biggest urge today at day 45.

I was literally a few steps from the vape store... I really really wanted to Vape nicotine. Not because I was nearby, I was just remembering the urges... I couldn't help it.

I almost said yes and I almost went to the store but I knew I would feel like SHIT after. A moment guys... ALL IT TAKES IS A MOMENT TO CHANGE YOUR MIND. 

This is scary... I don't trust myself for tomorow. I feel like vaping right now!!!

I'm going to buy cigarettes.

I smoked for half my life and now I've gone almost 10 months without smoking. Been feeling really pleased with myself because I'm about to turn 30 in 2 weeks, but I've just had the worst time recently, I got told something really sad on Monday and I have to wait til Friday to hear the outcome, so I've just been walking around feeling really sad and wishing that I could be smoking, I know it's really weak but I think it's the only thing that will calm me down today. Can I just smoke this week and then quit again after that? I just feel so so sad.

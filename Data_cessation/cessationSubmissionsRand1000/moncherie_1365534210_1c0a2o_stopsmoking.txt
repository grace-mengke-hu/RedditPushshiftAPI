Day Two: struggling

The most difficult part is oddly enough not the physical addiction but the emotional addiction.  I've realized it's my crutch when I am frustrated or emotionally distraught & need an escape.  Wow the adult pacifier aspect is the most difficult part.  Can anyone relate? Any suggestions?

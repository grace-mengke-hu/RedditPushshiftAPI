I know I've quit forever - but will I ever feel like a genuine non-smoker?

This is longest I've gone without cigarettes since I started. I'm doing great, no cravings at this point (so it feels like). I feel like I'm out of the woods but I'm still working hard on re-framing what cigarettes were to me. Yet I can't stop thinking of them as something like say eating a sugary snack on a strict diet. The desire might always be there even if I don't notice it, so I'm afraid they will always consume my thoughts to some extent and I'll always have to feel like I'm overly straight-edge to avoid them. Anyone got over this?

I found my motivation

So, there is this jerk I've known for years whom I don't like at all but am forced to bear in social situations because of professional obligations. 

I won't bore you with our long history, but he is my arch-nemesis.

Last night, I saw him at a social gathering and he asked me if I wanted to go outside for a cigarette. I told him that I am quitting. 

He took this as his cue to start tempting me and offering me a cigarette and talking about how great they are and don't you want to have just one?

This is the only motivation I need. I will never smoke again, because to do so would be to give this jerk the satisfaction of thinking that he somehow tempted me and got me to do something I didn't want to do.

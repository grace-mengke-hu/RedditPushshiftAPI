Going through a lot of shit and I want one :(

My husband and I are going through some really heavy shit and I'll be damned if that little memory of "relief" didn't pop into my head as soon as he and I parted ways for the weekend. I think I just want to feel something other than despair, anxiety and frustration. I'm not gonna do it though! I'm just putting it out here instead because you all will hold me accountable. Thanks for being here!

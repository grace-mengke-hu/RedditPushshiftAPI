I relaped last month but I'm quitting again.

Thanks to Allan Carr's audiobook, I quit smoking for a bit over 2 years.  For whatever reason, I just sort of felt like smoking again and after holding off for a while, I caved while drinking with a friend.  That obviously lead to buying my own packs and wasting lots of money in order to poison myself.  

Anyway, I bought some Nicoderm patches yesterday and am on day 2.  I will keep y'all posted on how this goes.

Time to reset my badge :)

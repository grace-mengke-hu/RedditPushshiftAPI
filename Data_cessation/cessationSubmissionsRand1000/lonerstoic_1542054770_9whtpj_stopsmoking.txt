Need Tips For Quitting Cold Turkey

I'm down to my last $300 and STILL want to spend money on cigarettes and lighters.  But part of me wants to try to quit.  I just smoked my last cigarette 10 minutes ago.  The weather is cold and I'm tired.  I really don't feel like going to the store and wasting money.

I hear from you all that cold turkey is the easiest and most effective method right?   Any tips?  Thanks in advance.

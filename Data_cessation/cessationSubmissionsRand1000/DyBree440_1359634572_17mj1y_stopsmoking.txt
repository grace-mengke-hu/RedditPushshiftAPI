Sigh, 25 days and now I have to reset.

I'm sorry.  I had one.  I was quickly reminded why I stopped smoking.  I was just under a lot of stress at my job where guests were being a total pain in my ass.  Then another guest was kind enough to bum me a cigarette.  I don't want another one, I just needed one for that moment.  It cost me 25 days.  25 days that I worked hard for. 25 days that I was proud that I had gotten too and I let a few scumbag guests get to me.

I went to bars, parties, concerts and not a single time did I want/need a smoke and these fucking assholes get to me and I break all that hard earned freedom!  Well, what's done is done.  Day 1, here I am!

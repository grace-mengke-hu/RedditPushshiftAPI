90 days in... My head is still trying to get me to smoke...

Hiya good folks of r/stopsmoking!

I got my 90 days badge today. I'm feeling proud of myself for having gone that long without smoking. I had my first taste when I was 8yo, started to smoke every day when I was 12yo, and I turned 39 this year, so this is huge for me! 

Most of the time it really feels like this is it, I've done it, and I'm never going back. But my head is still playing tricks on me. I'm still having thoughts on how good a smoke would be, how tasty it would be, and how satisfying it would be to feel that smoke going down my throat and back out. I'm usually pretty good at pushing these ideas away, but I find them more and more annoying, and I really thought they would be out of my head by now... 90 days is long when you know your brain is trying to trick you into inhaling poison!

How far into your cessation did these kind of ideas disappeared?

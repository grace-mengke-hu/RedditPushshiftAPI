Surviving my 2 week holiday with my stresshead father like a boss. BUT...

My boyfriend and my sister have been at each others' throats today and it's getting me down. I won't smoke though - I'm confident in that! Although I am getting into the self-destructive frame of mind which has been my fall down much of the time when quitting (I.e. Life is shit so who cares if I do die early). It's also making my mind turn to other ways I've dealt with things in the past - drinking, disordered eating, etc. anyone else have similar issues?

Virtual cuddles?

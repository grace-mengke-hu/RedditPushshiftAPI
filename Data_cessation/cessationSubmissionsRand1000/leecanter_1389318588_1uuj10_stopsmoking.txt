Quick general question about NRT and subreddits

I am not a stranger to r/stopsmoking (a quick look through my history will show a quit post I made on my birthday, I've since failed.) I've tried every form of quitting I can think of: cold turkey, NRT, and e-cigs, so I'm not a stranger to traditional methods.

I've been using nicotine patches for about a week and I'm doing great! Totally cigarette free, however I know that r/stopsmoking is usually a nicotine free quit zone (I.e. I feel like using badges is not right when I know nicotine is in my body.) 

 Just wondering if there is any subreddits dedicated to NRT and/or patches. PM or comment an answer (if there is one) and I'll gladly delete this post.

Good luck everyone!

TL;DR: Is there a subreddit for NRT and/or Nicotine Patches?

12 days smoke free

I have had some cravings over the past few days, but they are easy to manage, I think about why i have decided to stop. My lungs need healing, my brain needs healing, i can not afford them, i don't want to die from toxic smoke! Smoking ruins the skin, organs, eye sight,lungs. causes heart attacks, strokes. why do we smoke is it just a habit. I'm not sure why i smoked for so long. but it really sucks.

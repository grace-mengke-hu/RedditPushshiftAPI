I have the strength not to start, but don't have the strength to stop

I heard this today, in an interview with Burt Reynolds talking about his addiction to painkillers as a result of filming injuries he sustained. Hits home!

"I have the strength NOT to start, but I don't have the strength to stop"


That made a lot of sense to me as I am free from smoking now for some 429 days. I don't smoke, ....I have the strength not to start, but I know from having quit previously, that just 1 cigarette can make me start again and make it almost impossible to get a good quit going again. It's true!

If you're quit, stay quit!  "Just one"- does not exist. It's an "all or nothing" proposition when it comes to addiction!.  Resist the "one" for all the same  reasons you resist the "all" of them.

Thanks to Burt Reynolds for being so frank and reminding me and others of what addiction is.

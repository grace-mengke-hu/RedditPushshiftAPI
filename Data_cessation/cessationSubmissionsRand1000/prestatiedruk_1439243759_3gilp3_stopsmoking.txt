It's been a week but I feel like I'm cheating

It's been one week! I had my last drag of a cigarette Monday night, it tasted disgusting, I threw it out before I was half done with it. I've had one or two cravings since then. However, I feel like I'm cheating.

I'm sick with a nasty cough since last week Tuesday and while I wasn't able to spend much time in bed to get better I definitely just walked around like a zombie. It's not how I usually feel of course, so I'm not sure if it really counts.

Do any of you have experience with quitting and then becoming sick? It helps for sure with the cravings. Still..

eating everything that isn't nailed down...

this is day four and my snacking is out of control. doesn't matter the food, i'll still eat. any other ways to deal with cravings that might be healthier than snacking? also, as a five year smoker i definitely devoloped some habbits that are sooo hard to break. like what do i do on my morning commute to work? or if i'm 20 minutes early to class? its crazy to think how ingrained cigarettes are in my life. just another reason why to quite i suppose.

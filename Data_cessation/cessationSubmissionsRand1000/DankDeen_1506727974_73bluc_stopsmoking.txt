Almost 2/3 of a year. I remember there was a point in my life where I couldn't imagine a day smoke free, a day spent smiling, a day spent smelling like Cologne and not smoke. Until I took that first step. I tell everyone it was the best thing I could have done for myself. Love you guys! You can too!

Ways of motivating myself?

I am an occasional smoker. I smoke only on weekends mostly, around a pack on a weekend. Maybe half. but not more. 
Even though its not much, it bothers me and i want to quit. But its hard for me.
Do you know any motivational tricks to help me go through it and not smoke? 
Something connected with $ or something i dunno

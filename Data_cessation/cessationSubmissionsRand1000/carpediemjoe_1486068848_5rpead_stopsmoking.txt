I had no idea how stressful it was to be a smoker...

Till I became a non-smoker. I'm on day 94 of my quit and I'm on my first business trip as a non-smoker. No more fear of Hertz discovering I smoked in the rental car. No more standing in front of the hotel at 6:00am and 10:00pm in my pajamas to smoke (and having to wear leather dress shoes with pajamas if I forgot my slippers). No more having to get up during business dinners to smoke. No more having to spend 15 minutes making my way outside of the convention center to smoke outside and then walk all the way back. Being able to wake up up in the morning and make coffee in the room and lay in bed and catch up on news with my iPad without having massive anxiety about wanting to step out to a smoke.

Even if you love smoking you have to admit that in 2017 when it costs a fortune and you can't smoke anywhere... it doesn't make sense. 

Thanks to everyone on this sub. I can't believe I made it this far. After trying to quit dozens of times over the past 10 years it's surreal to be free.

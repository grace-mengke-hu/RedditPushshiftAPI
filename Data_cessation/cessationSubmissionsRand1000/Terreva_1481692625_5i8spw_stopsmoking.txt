So proud of myself

52 days clean, 1 month, 20 days, 23 hours, 15 minutes, and 30 seconds. 

I'm am seriously proud. Thank you Chantix. The anxiety of coming off it soon, though, is worrying me. Idk how much it costs without insurance and insurance for me ends on december 31. :( It said the main reason why people don't hold their quit is because they didn't hold to the program, but I might literally be forced off it. :(

My badge says 81 days.. I'm confused... >_> I reset it?

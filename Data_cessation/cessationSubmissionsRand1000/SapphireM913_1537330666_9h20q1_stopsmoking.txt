7 weeks tomorrow

Patches and lozenges  

I think I missed The Answer (day 42), but that's technically good, right?

It's gotten easier. I still have no decent coping mechanisms for stress and anger, but I know those take time. Right now, we go with apathy.

Cigarettes don't smell good anymore. It's both a blessing and a curse. 

I remember asking "when will I stop feeling like I'm walking on eggshells, when will I stop thinking I'll fail?" The answer was a steep decline around Week 6, but no specific one day. The step down on patches at Week 6 and the repeated dislike of the smell of smoke were two big factors. 

I remember surprising myself with the slew of cuss words I put together to get through the first couple of weeks.

I remember telling everyone I'd made it 4 weeks, and some people being clearly surprised it wasn't longer, and others putting pom poms in their hair and doing a high kick for me. 

I remember picking up my 18 month old nephew for the first time after quitting and he reacted to my smell differently. Yeah... He could tell.

I remember realizing my sense of smell had increased. Then realizing there was a nasty funk in my house. And another in my car. Still trying to find and Purge the house one... I remember the first time I had PMS after quitting, and my sense of smell increased even more. I smelled the garbage cans at work 3 cubes away. 

I'm nervous about stepping off the patch entirely. In nervous about going into a gas station and accidentally saying "and a pack of..." And then not having the strength to say "wait, no, I quit". I'm nervous about losing my shit and giving up, not like "I don't know if I can hold onto this quit" eggshells I was on, but "fuck it, I don't actually want to be quit". I'm nervous about dating a smoker. I'm nervous about a lot... But less than I was 7 weeks ago.

What do you do around an old smoking buddy?

Hey guys, my husband has a friend over right now who I used to chill and smoke with on our balcony. I also just had a big meal. The cravings are hitting me pretty hard right now. I'm doing okay and I know I won't relapse...but has anyone else had this experience and have any good tips on getting through without too much torture?

2 Weeks! Had an urge to have one yesterday.

Was having an awful day, and I was desperate for one. What helped me through the cravings was knowing that if I had one, all this hard 2 weeks worth of work would have gone out the window in just a few short minutes. Very happy I didn't give in.

To anybody else struggling, keep reminding yourself of all the negatives of smoking and all the positives of quitting. I'm saving hella money and my breathing is already improving!

Goodluck everybody.

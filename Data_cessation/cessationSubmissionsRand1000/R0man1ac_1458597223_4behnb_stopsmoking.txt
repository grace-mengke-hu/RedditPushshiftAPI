Four days! (even though my smiley says three).

Hey everyone. 

My little smile guy says three days, which is totally fine, (because I did actually cheat once on the first day, but I think one cigarette in four days is pretty great, especially since it was day one). WE'LL JUST SAY IT'S THREE! 

Anyway, things are going good. I was feeling bad about myself for relapsing after SO many days of not smoking. But I feel more confident already. It's already easier to work out again. Yoga is more fun. The sun already shines brighter.

I have had a *few* anger snaps. Once today when my boyfriend wouldn't stop calling my name, and a few nights ago when I woke up to NO blankets. The nicotine monster made it a bigger deal than it had to be, but overall. I am feeling fantastic.

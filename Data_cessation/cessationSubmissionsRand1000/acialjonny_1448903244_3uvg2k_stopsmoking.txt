Starting over. 40 hours down.

Screwed up. Watched football. Drank beer. Smoked. Didn't smoke all day yesterday and went back to the gym this morning and literally already feel better.

Started a full vegan diet yesterday. It's helping motivate me to not smoke again. Work is a little tough right now tho, so I'm chewing seeds.

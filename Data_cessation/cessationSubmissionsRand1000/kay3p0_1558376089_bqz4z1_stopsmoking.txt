On day 3. Feeling good. Excited to keep it up.

This is my third time really trying to quit, the longest being a month. I read Allen Carr last week and quit after a night of late drinking where I smoked a whole pack in a few hours.

Using the Smoke Free app and my favorite part of Day 3 is knowing the nicotine is gone from my body. That said, I’m definitely experiencing some nasty withdrawals: headache and just a gross feeling. But whats interesting is smoking made me feel this way from time to time. So it’s helping me remember what I’m finally free from! 

I feel really confident in my quit and just wanted to share with everyone to help reinforce how I feel. I’ve let so many bad cravings—ones from stress, anger, and boredom—pass and I know I’m stronger than my cravings.  I know I have to stay vigilant—god knows I’ve relapsed after longer quits than this. But it feels so good to be a non smoker!

I slipped up yesterday, and today I'm feeling sick.

I posted yesterday because I had a slip up. I ended up smoking 5 cigarettes overall. Interestingly, I have no cravings today, but I'm sick as a dog, with a splitting headache, one angry pair of lungs, and completely closed off sinuses.

They didn't even taste good, at all, but I got into this "well, the day is lost anyway" mentality.

The only upside is that I thought this slip-up would ruin my progress, but instead it strengthened my resolve.

An average day to stop.

Well my new dentist advised, had to see Doctor for antibiotics for chest infection whilst asking him what I could possibly do to get better from the coughing, wheezing, spluttering and getting a headache to boot as well. Five years at medical school and two words of genus 'stop smoking'. So this all happened and today has been hard smoking all day except the last two which felt less horrible as I was giving up. So I am here unexpected but okay with my decision.

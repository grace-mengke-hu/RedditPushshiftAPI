One Week!

Today marks one week of being a non smoker, after 35 years of smoking.

I am busy retraining my brain at trigger times. Instead of a smoke, I have tea or a walk around the block. I'm also working on not obsessing. When I find myself obsessing, I ask myself some questions about why I quit; I have an internal self talk. I'm enjoying the changes that are happening in my body.

To stay on the path to recovery, I've been taking it one day at a time. Sometimes, less than that. I check in here twice a day, more if needed, usually in the morning and then at bed time. I also read Freedom from Nicotine before going to sleep, it's sort of my 12-step book. I haven't told anyone that I've quit, so Reddit is an important place for me. At the moment, it's a safe place and I appreciate that.

Here's hoping to a long and healthy recovery!

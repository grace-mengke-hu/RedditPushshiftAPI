Slipping and sliding. Applying the brakes.

Well guys, I joined this forum back in January.  Since then I have attempted to quit smoking 25+ times.  I have lasted anywhere from 24 hours, to 3 days, to 10 days, but I have gone back over and over again.  It's a very difficult place to be in.  To put in all that work, only to find yourself smoking again. 

I'm very much sick of this addiction.  I'm very much ready to quit, hence why I have not and will not give up.  I'm scared I have done damage to my body, and I feel like an idiot sometimes but I know that doesn't do me any good.  I just need some support right now because I am not happy with myself.

I have a fiancee who needs me to quit so we can have kids, and I want to quit for my own health.  I have done so much work and I want to stop backsliding.  I want to make this stick.  I'm going to quit, I know it.  I need to.  Failure is not acceptable.  Maybe I just needed to vent here.  Thanks for listening

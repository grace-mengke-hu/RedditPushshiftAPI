Day 2

This is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. I thought I would be miserable, but I feel... Healthy! I'm not puking anymore, and the thought of smoking and gagging just makes me shudder. I don't need them, and it's so easy! The only thing I need to remind myself is to not give myself rewards. So far I haven't even thought about that until right this moment!

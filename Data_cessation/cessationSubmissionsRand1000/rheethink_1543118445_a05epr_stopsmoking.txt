I want to give up.

5 days 19hrs in. What started off as a good day has turned into a shit one.

I want to smoke a cigarette. Going to go for a run and if I still want to smoke when I get back, Im pretty sure I'm going to break.

I'm weak. I'm sorry. This isn't easy and I don't think I can handle it. I've been useless for the past 4 days. I don't want to feel like this.

The end.

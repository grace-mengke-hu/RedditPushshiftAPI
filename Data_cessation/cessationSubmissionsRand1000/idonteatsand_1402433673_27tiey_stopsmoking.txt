I don't think I will ever quit smoking...

I have tried again and again and again.  Sometimes I've had success; a month and a half of sweet non-smoking.  But it always ends the same.  Just one puff.  Just one cigarette. And it falls down.

I just don't think I can quit.  I hate it yet I love it.  I want to quit, but really, I know I don't.  I can't change and I hate it.

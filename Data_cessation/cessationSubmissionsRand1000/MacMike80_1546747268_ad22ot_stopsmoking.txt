Day 5 and I didn’t budge!

Day 5 is finishing up.  It has definitely been the toughest, I think because I had to do a lot of driving for work today- being in my car and driving is one of the worst triggers for me, especially since it was so nice in Wisconsin today and I wanted to put the window down and cruise.  I’m hoping tomorrow is easier.  Looking forward to being able to stay in bed all day if I’m too cranky and to just sleep day 6 away.

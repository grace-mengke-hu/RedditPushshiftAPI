Things that have worked for me

I’m 17 days in now, smoke free. So far these things have helped me

1. Smoke free app, and talking with the quit coach robot on there

2. Deep breathing and staying mindful

3. Playing on my phone

4. Listening to music

5. Keeping busy, cleaning or sorting stuff

6. Opened up a tax free savings account and have $200 in there so far

7. Joined orange theory fitness and going three times a week. Even when I don’t feel like it

8. Talking to my online friend Ambey 

9. Reddit and this forum

10. Posting on Facebook and getting positive replies.  Helps me be accountable

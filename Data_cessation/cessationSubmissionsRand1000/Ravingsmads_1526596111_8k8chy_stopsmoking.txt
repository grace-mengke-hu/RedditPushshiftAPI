CMV: I hate cigarettes but I don't hate nicotine.. am I being unreasonable?

Hello,

Been considering quitting for a while now. But while I know the effects of smoking I don't really see a need to quit nicotine itself.

I always had anger issues since I was little. My mother smoked heavily while carrying me (she's not a shitty person, just addicted). I had anger issues til I was 18 or so and the moment I picked up smoking they disappeared. I'm not a doctor but I do believe me being born to a smoker really messed up my brain chemistry and doomed me to a life of nicotine addiction. I'm totally open to change my view if possible (I actually wish I can find any source. but everything points to the fact that babies born to addicts have depleted dopamine and are more prone to addictions) I had to endure heavy second hand smoke all my life in a household of heavy smokers and I believe I was addicted from the get-go.

Anyway, I'm 22 now and my life is going great, I picked up bodybuilding recently and I'm loving it. But I hate how smoking is affecting my endurance, I hate how it yellows my teeth, I hate how it makes me smell, and I hate having to leave malls/social settings often to smoke.

But I don't want to have my anger issues, I don't want my depression back, and I honestly believe that smoking is what "cured" me if that is even possible. I'm considering to switch to vaping/chewing instead of quitting. Any thoughts? Anyone wanna give another opinion on why nicotine itself is harmful?

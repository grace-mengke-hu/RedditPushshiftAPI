You’ve come to the right place - 2 years today

Welcome. I’m glad wherever you are, whatever you do, however old you are, whatever reasons for coming here, that you are here looking to become a non smoker. I don’t miss it, on the contrary, I’m grateful to be so satisfied on the other side of the destructive and uncontrolled cigarette addiction that I barely remember the talons tight grip.

Write it out. Ride it out. You’ve already begun your journey to shedding that unwanted stink from your life, and I support you. So many people support you. It’s obvious that you’re going to make it here on this side with those of us who will never have another puff again. Happily. 

One day at a time. Two years feels nice. It feels… permanent. It feels solid, and ergonomic, and at rest. It feels so good. A real accomplishment. A true change for the better. A true impact on the quality of my life.

I wish you all the best, and welcome you to walk this way.

Dreaded Smoking Dream

It finally happened - the dreaded smoking dream.  
I went to bed last night craving a cigarette so badly (I had a rough evening) and, of course, dreamed about smoking.  I thought that maybe I was going to be safe from that particular side effect of quitting, Guess not.

In my dream, I was at a county fair hanging out in a smoking trailer (I don't know, either) hiding from my husband and chain smoking. I remember every bit of it clearly - from feeling the between my fingers to putting it to my lips and inhaling.  In my dream I kept thinking "This is going to make me so sick" and then being surprised when it didn't make me feel ill at all.

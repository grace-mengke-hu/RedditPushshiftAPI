Quit smoking 12 days ago and I have had a shitty week and feel lonely

As the title states quit smoking 12 days ago I really want to pick up a pack of ciggerates to suppress these emotions I feel as unhealthy as that sounds. I lost my job this week, have no plans going on this weekend, and I quit all together so I’m feeling really fucking shitty at the moment. In retrospect I’m starting to realize part of the reason why I smoked in the first place to suppress these emotions but god damn this loneliness, anxiety, and depression is awful

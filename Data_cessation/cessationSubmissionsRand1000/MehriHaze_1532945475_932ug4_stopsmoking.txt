So an update for from 15 year old wanting to try cigarettes

So It was an hot day and I decided to go around forest and town. I sat down on some propety and just decided to do it. I lighted it up and smoked the cigarette,no pain in lungs or throat since I smoke weed reguarly im an pro smoker. I smoked whole of it and I felt the light headnes instantly after I killed the cig I washed my mouth for some reason a couple of times. When I was smoking I decided to show off a bit in front of other parents of kids and I loved how they all looked at me and avoided me (In my town every kid smokes it so nobody looks at kids weird when they smoke) Also after smoking it I for some reason in a secind felt like smoking another one (which I didnt) For now I think this is it not planning to smoke another one, but ill definetely blaze again in a day or two. Thanks for all replies regarding my previous post and I appreciate everyone who told me that I shouldnt do it cuz of my age.

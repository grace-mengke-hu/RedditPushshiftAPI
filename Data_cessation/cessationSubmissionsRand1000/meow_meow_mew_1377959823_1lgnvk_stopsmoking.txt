Today is day one.

Just finished reading Allen Carr's book and am feeling very excited to stop smoking.  

However, I am unsure how to deal with my friends.  I know I will be bombarded with questions and confused looks when I go back to school on Tuesday.  Do I just come out and tell everyone, "I stopped smoking", or do I wait until I am (inevitably) asked about it.  

I worry about the reactions I will receive due to my past failed attempts to stop. 

What have your experiences been with your friends that smoke and do you have any advice?

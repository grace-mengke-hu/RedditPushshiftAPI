Putting it off....

I quit in April of 2014 because I was pregnant. I stayed quit until January of 2015. Started again with the typical just one while drinking and I'm back to a pack or more a day. I hate it. I want to quit. And now I have to pass a nicotine test for work in two and a half weeks. I've quit before. 4 times to be exact. So I know it can be done. I planned to quit Sunday but still had smokes. Ran out of those yesterday and thought ok, I'll quit now. Of course went and bought more. Ran out today. Thought I'll quit now. Went and bought more. I've read Allen Carr multiple times. I know smoking is a mind fuck. I just can't stop putting off the discomfort of quitting.

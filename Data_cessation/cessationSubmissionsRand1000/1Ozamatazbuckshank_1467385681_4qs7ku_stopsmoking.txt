3 weeks.

It's been three weeks now since I quit smoking. Today is by far the hardest day yet. Boss man is being a massive douche and really pissing me off today. You know what though? Fuck that guy. I'm not getting all stressed out and giving up on this. Me not smoking is bigger than all his bullshit. Sorry to rant, I'm sure you guys can relate. Good luck to everyone.

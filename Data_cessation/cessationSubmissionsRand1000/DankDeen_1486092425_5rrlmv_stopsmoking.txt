I'm gonna try this again, because I want to be healthy.

Hey guys, I'm 21, turning 22 in 16 days and I've been smoking for roughly 3 years. I found this sub last week and I tried my luck at cold turkey and lasted 48 hours before I caved.

Basically I was walking into work that morning and I'm looking at the door thinking, "How could I be here for 12 hours and prevent myself from walking out the backdoor in the kitchen and smoking?" Didn't believe in myself enough, turned around and walked 50 feet to the smoke shop and bought a pack. I've hated myself with every puff. 

With my birthday coming up in 16 days, I'm thinking seriously about quitting, I wanna be smoke free at 23. I figure I have so many years ahead of me, as long as I take care of myself. I know Cigarette smoke is literal poison but, the cravings kill me. 

Anyway so basically I'm here for some words of wisdom, some stories of non smokers that I can think of when I really want to smoke. Thanks in advance, my non smoking journey starts right now(but I need your help!).

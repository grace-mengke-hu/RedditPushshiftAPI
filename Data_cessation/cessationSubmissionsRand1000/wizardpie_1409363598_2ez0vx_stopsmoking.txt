I hated everything today

Man, everything seemed to set me off today, im still quit but oh my god. Ive never felt depression swings or anything like that, either i am fine or i am not so fine. Last 48 hours im just like mad at the sun, intense rage made me have to breath deep alot at work, i felt like quitting my job it was so bad. Man, this is the breaking point and i know now my lizard brain is scrambling and tearing to get me back into it. Been cold turkey 13 days, shitfuckasshat.

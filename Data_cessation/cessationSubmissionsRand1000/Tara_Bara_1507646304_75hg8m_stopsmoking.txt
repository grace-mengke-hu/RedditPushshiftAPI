What's the grossest thing you've done to feed your addiction?

People always call smoking a "habit," but it's really so much more than that...it's an addiction. It's so powerful, in fact, I remember one quit I was jonesing so bad for a smoke, I picked up a half-smoked butt off the floor (the DIRT floor, I should say) and lit it. God only knows how much bacteria was on that thing, or whose mouth smoked it. It's just helpful to remember we're not trying to stop biting our nails. This addiction is the real deal...a disease.

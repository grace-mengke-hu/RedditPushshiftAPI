NO NO NO!!!!

Just realized that in my rush to get to work this morning...I forgot my nicotine gum. 

I am also working in a lab this week where the building's smoking area is right in front of the window my temporary desk sits in front of. 

I literally cannot help but see people smoking all day.

Well this certainly sucks donkey balls...

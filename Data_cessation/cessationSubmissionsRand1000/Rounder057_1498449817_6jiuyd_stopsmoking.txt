96 hours in.....

Once again I thought that this would be an easy day. It wasn't a bad day or anything like that, it was just a whole day of my life centered around the fact that I still don't smoke. It owns my existence. I remember hearing that 72 hours and the body is nicotine free so I was expecting to not feel like I want a smoke. The amped up moments are getting further away but they still come. I am tearing through straws like crazy; chain chewing. I know that the worst is over and there is comfort there but I just want to feel 100% normal again. I want instant results like smoking used to give. I have to remember that all of this takes effort now, quitting isn't easy and there is a win in that. The process takes time and the fact that I didn't smoke today means I won. I just keep telling myself, no matter how I feel or what I think that 
This isn't forever
This is worth it.

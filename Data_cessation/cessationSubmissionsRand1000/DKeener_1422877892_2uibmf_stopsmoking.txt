Got inspired!

Well since I quit I had been thinking I should try to get healthier than just quitting smoking.  And I figured out that getting off my butt to go to the kitchen to get some chips was not a healthy exercise.
Today I found the gym!  I did 30 minutes on an elliptical machine, and the best part is I didn't feel like I was going to die due to lack of oxygen.  Muscles are tired, and I'm sweating a lot.  But because I quit I can still breath!!  Never really thought about how much I struggled before, but now I think I can stay off the smokes and maybe get healthier too!

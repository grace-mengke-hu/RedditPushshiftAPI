TFFT

A long day of two halves. First half slow and constant with occasional strong urge. Second part fast and generally urge free and now home. So that's 24 hours smoke free. What an odd day but it was lovely to not want to find time for a cigarette. That feeling of being free. But first 5 hours of a 12 hour shift was pretty exhausting. Over now and better for it.

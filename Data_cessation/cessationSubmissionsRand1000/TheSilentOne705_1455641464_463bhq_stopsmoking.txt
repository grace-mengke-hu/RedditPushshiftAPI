Two weeks! Now when does my nose stop running?

On week 3 right now, but a few questions about withdrawal effects:

1) Normally, it's 2-4 weeks for effects to clear up, right?

2) Nose is stopping up at night with nosebleeds in the morning. Is this an effect of dry air in my home, or could this be a side effect of everything attempting to normalize?

3) Indigestion keeps cropping up. I'm drinking a lot of water to compensate, but is that + heartburn very common?

4) Weight gain/appetite: I've gained a few pounds, but either my scale is insane, or I have an over/under of 8 lbs. When does the appetite usually normalize?

If these symptoms keep up for another 2 weeks, I'm planning to visit the doc, but I'd like everyone's opinion first.

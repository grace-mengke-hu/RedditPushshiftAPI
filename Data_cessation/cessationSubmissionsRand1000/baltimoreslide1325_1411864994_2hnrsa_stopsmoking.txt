Nearly 72 hours...again

I've had a long bout of on-and-off quitting and getting sucked back in.  
I made a plan with another user here to get an e-cig and use it to get out of smoking hell. (Yay /r/stopsmoking crew, so amazing.)
My big plan involved getting an e-cig on Friday, when I got paid, as I was flat broke 'til then.  
But then I got super sick on Wednesday night and haven't smoked since then--nearly 72 hours. Still sick, too, so not craving.  
I used to be the sort who'd smoke while sick, but these days I get nasty sinus infection-like things EVERY time I get what would otherwise be a normal cold--and the thought of smoking, or even being near cigarette smoke, is viscerally repulsive at those times.  
And, duh, I probably got multiple sinus infections last year because I am (was) a smoker, and I'm probably sick right now because of smoking. F--- stupid cigarettes!
So I'm gonna just keep on keepin' on with not smoking now, no e-cig.
My next check point is 3 weeks--see you then! Good luck everyone!

Thanksgiving was the worst. Celebrating a small victory.

I spent Thanksgiving with the family of a friend of mine. 15 of us all stayed in her home, 200 people showed up for dinner (it's kind of a fancy deal they do every year).

We all drank and ate AMAZING food and it was so many of my triggers combining- alcohol, big dinner, lots of people and noise, a bunch of smokers. And I somehow managed to not do it. Still hanging in there- you can too.

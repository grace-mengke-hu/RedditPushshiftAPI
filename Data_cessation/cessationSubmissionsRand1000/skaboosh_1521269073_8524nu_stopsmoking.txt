Almost at 5 months since I quit, boyfriend of 1 1/2 years jumped dumped me and...

I didn’t smoke! I didn’t even want to. My world feels as though it is crumbling apart, yet I know the one thing I would run to would just make this 10x worse. I tried hard to quit, and even though I feel like my world is falling apart, I will not give in and I will not smoke.

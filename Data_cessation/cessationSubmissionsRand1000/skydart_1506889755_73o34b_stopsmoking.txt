Had a weird realization today, might help those who are a few days in struggling with commitment issues.

First of all- apologies for all of my recent posting, this place has been so helpful for me. Thank you guys!

So I'm on my 7th day, and it's been a real struggle for me. I was still terrified to commit to the quit, but I just took one day at a time hoping I'd have some sort of realization. Also, it helped that I REALLY didn't want to have to go through days 1-3 again.

My biggest fear was that I would never stop wanting a cigarette. But today, the cravings started to lessen a bit and I had this realization: **Even if the appeal of smoking never goes away (which it may or may not), that desire is not going to ruin my day. It won't be a constant nag.** Yes, maybe I want a cigarette, but I also want a jacuzzi. When I see someone's jacuzzi, I'm like "Man, it would be cool to own a jacuzzi." But jacuzzis are super expensive and hard to take care of, and when you leave that person's house, it's kind of out of sight, out of mind. Also, that jacuzzi will kill you eventually. Who wants a murder jacuzzi?

Just keep that in mind when things seem dark. It does get easier.

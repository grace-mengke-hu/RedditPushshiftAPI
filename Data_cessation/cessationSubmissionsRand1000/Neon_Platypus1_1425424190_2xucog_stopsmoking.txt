Wait... It's been a month, already?

Seriously, I haven't even noticed how fast this first month went by. It's been really a strange experience, because it's been nothing like my past quits. I haven't even gotten the cough-induced cleanse... Yet? Usually my lungs clear out with a few days of coughing, but maybe I just haven't noticed. I haven't really noticed any changes unless I really think about it... It's weird, but I'm glad that I've basically just forgotten that I ever smoked. 

For those about to quit or on the considering stage, here's the best thing about being a non-smoker: *You're happier.* It won't completely fix your life, but I've been feeling better in the last month than I have in the last three years. I'm actually smiling for no reason, ready to get up in the morning, *not lethargic*! It's truly a change for the better, and you will feel so much more than you do now.

Here's to a month, keep up the good work guys! And thank you for being the most supportive subreddit I've been to!

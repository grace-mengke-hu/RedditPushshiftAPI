Today marks the 34th day of quitting

It's incredible how far exercising self-awareness can take you. My cravings have gone down significantly and I have more energy than before. I feel great overall and want to push myself even harder now that I've hit a milestone. This subreddit has also helped me out alot. Even though I rarely post, I am always reading about your struggles and your successes, and all of them are very inspiring. So thank you everyone, and may all of you lay off the ugly 'bacc for good.

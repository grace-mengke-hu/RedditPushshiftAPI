Fifth time quitting, but the first time I've gotten the cough.

This is my fifth or so time to quit. The anecdotes are correct that it is easier each time you stop. I have a question though. In my previous ... we'll call them "practice attempts" at quitting... I've never had a cough like I am now. It has been a little over a month and I'm still hacking. Is it possibly just a coincidence or is it related to my quit? This cough wont go away and I'm going to see a doctor, but I wanted to talk to you guys while I wait for my appointment day.

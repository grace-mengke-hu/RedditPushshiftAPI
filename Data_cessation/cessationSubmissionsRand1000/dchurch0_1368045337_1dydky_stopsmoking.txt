Decided to quit. Has anyone tried using lozenges?

Hi guys,

I've been a smoker for about three years now, and I really want to kick the habit. I just bought a house, and don't want to deal with butts in my yard or on the patio, etc. Plus I would really like to save the money, both up front from purchasing smokes, and later in life from health care costs.

I picked up a pack of nicotine lozenges the last time I was out getting groceries, and so far they have been pretty good at taking away my cravings. I'm only on day two, but so far so good. I previously tried switching to e-cigs, but instead of helping wean myself off of smoking, I tended to smoke (vape?) more, since I could do it inside in the comfort of my home.

Have any of you ever used the lozenges? How was your experience with them?

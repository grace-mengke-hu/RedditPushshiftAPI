Day 1 - It's not easy

Day 1: I've cried twice and leaned on nearly every person I know for words of encouragement. I need it today, I am using champix but even with that I miss the act of smoking, the habit in my day, the thing that calms me down. I just keep reminding myself of my reasons, asking my friends theirs, and pushing through another hour smoke free.

Day ten, bad cravings today

Done ten days cold turkey, will be 11 by 3:30pm today! Cravings had been getting better but for some reason they are awful today feel like Iâ€™ve been craving continuously since this morning. Trying to do breathing excercises and drink lots of water but thought would post on here for as well! Did anyone experience cravings getting worse after they had got better??

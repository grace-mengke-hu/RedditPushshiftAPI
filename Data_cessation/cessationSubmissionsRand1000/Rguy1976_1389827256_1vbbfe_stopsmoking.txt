Ok... No excuses...

I quit about 2 weeks ago with very few problems.  Last night I was at a friends house smoking pot (Coloradan here..) and my buddy handed me a cigarette....  Needless to say, I smoked it.  This morning I grabbed a pack at the store without even thinking about it...  Sooooooo, I have gone ahead and resubmitted for a badge.  Threw the pack away just now.  Feeling slightly embarrassed cause I was doing so well.  I'm officially back in the ring with you all again.

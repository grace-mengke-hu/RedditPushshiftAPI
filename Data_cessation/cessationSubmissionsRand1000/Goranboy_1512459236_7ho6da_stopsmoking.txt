Never coughed up grey/black stuff after quitting, is it still in there?

Good Morning guys, I might just be overreacting here and need some perspective. I quit smoking 4 months ago and never had the cough. Never coughed up the black/gray stuff some people on here talk about. I have been smoking for 10 years and for the most part around a pack a day. So I think there should be something down my lungs which doesn't necessarily belong there. Can it be, that it is still down there? is there a way to initiate the process of getting it out? I am a little concerned here. Any points of view out there? Much appreciated

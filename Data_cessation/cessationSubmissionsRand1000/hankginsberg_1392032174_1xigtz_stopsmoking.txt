18 days in and, wow, wall hit.

I wasn't expecting today. You see people post that and you note it but you still don't expect it when it hits. This morning was great. I pulled myself out of bed and had run 3km by 7am. I got through work alright and figured today would be like the last week - pretty breezy. It hit about 4:30 and since then I've been dropped by overwhelming lethargy, found it impossible to concentrate and unable to doze off. The crush of withdrawal has been all over my body even though I know that by now it's only mental. I've got heaps to do and need to pull myself out of this funk.
Whinge over. Thanks for listening.

Day one complete.

Hey everyone. I came back yesterday after relapsing for a month. Reset my badge back from 119 days. I think I messed up by not continuing to post in this subreddit. I feel like if I hadn't quit posting, I probably wouldn't be here now back at day one. A lot of things happened all at once, I was offered a smoke at work, and I took it. I've been smoking for about three weeks to a month. 

The crazy part about it is during those 119 days, I was working out like crazy. Doing yoga every single day. I did a complete turn around. A lot of people have commented that I look like I've been working out, my legs have more definition. It made me feel horrible because once again I was a closet smoker. I quit working out. 

But today, the first day of being a non-smoker yet again, I woke up early, pushed myself on a two mile run. Came home and went on a walk with the pup and boyfriend. Went to a new yoga class, and haven't smoked a single cigarette. 

See you tomorrow /r/stopsmoking!

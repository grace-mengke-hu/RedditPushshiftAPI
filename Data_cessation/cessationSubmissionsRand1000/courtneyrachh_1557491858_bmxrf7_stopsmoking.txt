here we go again

okay friends,

I've been on this sub for like, six months or so. and I keep falling off track.

I once made it THIRTEEN DAYS and started smoking, telling myself "just one" but here we are. I typically can go through the week fine, but weekends are what kill me. It's like, come friday afternoon i just NEED a cigarette.

And I know, I shouldn't be drinking or around my friends that smoke in the beginning, but right now, I'm day TWO!!! without smoking for the first time in months, and I plan on hanging out with friends who don't smoke tonight, but tomorrow is my friends wedding, and I know I will be drinking a little, and I KNOW there are friends there that smoke.

I'm pretty nervous to be honest, but it's not like I can skip the wedding.

Any advice?!

I relapsed, but I'm not quitting quitting: a thank you/apology to the community

Today I cracked, bough a pack, and have smoked about half already. 

I hadn't been happy quitting, as best typified [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/35rbny/can_somebody_help_me_with_my_quit_plan_it_isnt/) At the end of the day my mental health couldn't take it, and so I smoked on my fifth day. Mental health is a precious thing, and I'd rather abort this attempt (and try again in a day or two) than endanger it further. 

I'm not quitting on quitting, though. The road I took was far too rocky for me to pass, but I still want to make the journey. I'm going to keep going and find a new route. My doc only does same day appointments, so tomorrow morning I'll be up early, booking one, and seeking help on how to try to do thing for my physical health while maintaining my mental health. 

I am not giving up. I'm not quitting on quitting. 

But, I feel bad because of the tremendous support I've found here this week. People have reached out and offered the kind of support which has damn near brought me to tears. 

This community is by far the most incredible resource I've come across, and if anyone mentions they're thinking of quitting the first bit of advice I'm going to give is /r/stopsmoking 

I'm sorry for everyone who's poured their hearts out in support that I've let down by smoking and listening to that nicotine monster. But rest assured, I'll be back in a few days, a new plan in place and renewed in strength. 

Until then, I can't thank you enough. You're wonderful people, and I wouldn't be able to take the tool of being able to say "I lasted five days" into my next journey if it wasn't for you all. 

Thank you, I'm sorry, and I'll be back.

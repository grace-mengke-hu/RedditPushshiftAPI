Life is better without smoking.

I don't feel cravings. I know I need to be strong. But after 3 weeks, I do feel like I was never a smoker. It's so much more convenient to not smoke. The benefits definitely outweigh the negatives. I remember when I used to smoke, one day I realised, this sensation that it gives me, this feeling, is just pure "pleasure" but without any substance. If I thought about it, I couldn't explain why I thought it was good at all. It was just a feeling. It didn't bring me any satisfaction. Now that I don't smoke, I don't miss them. I don't feel like I'm missing out. I hang out with smokers all the time, and while I admit, the small whispers of smoke that do enter my nostrils is about the most delicious thing I've ever smelt, I'm absolutely content with that. I don't feel like my life is any less rich, which is what I was afraid of. It's what broke me last time. Now my daily routine, where previously my destination/goal would be a cigarette, now I'll have a coffee. I drink maybe one a day. The other night I went out to some comedy, had a couple of beers, and never once thought about cigarettes the whole night. There comes a time I think when you just have to stop, and there's no more you can do. Where you make a choice, and that's the choice you make.

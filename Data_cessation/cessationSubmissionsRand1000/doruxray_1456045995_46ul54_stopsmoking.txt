On 9th day without a single puff! I'm getting there

So 9 days people, 9 days :D I am so proud of myself. I went to the cinema yesterday and after the movie people outside lit up and I was wondering why I wasn't doing the same, but then I remembered why. Keep going people, life is so much better without those awful cigarettes.

I Just Ran 5k For the First Time in at Least 15 Years

I quit smoking on 14 February 2016 because in part I couldn't even walk up and down the very moderate hill that is my driveway without getting severely winded.  I decided to do the c25k program in April and while I'm not done with it yet, and 5k in 52 minutes isn't a great time, I couldn't have done this if I had continued smoking.  I know this because I attempted c25k a few times while I was smoking and never got past week 1.  

But, most of all, I couldn't have quit successfully without the support of this sub.  Thank you all.

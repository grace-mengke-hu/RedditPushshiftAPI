3-Year Check-In

Can't believe it's been 3 years. I'm going through a pretty rough patch these days (months actually), so I'm holding on to all the little victories I can, and this is definitely one of those.


I come here once in a while to read and upvote people's stories. We all have our own struggles, triggers, and anxieties, but I know you can do this. You all have the capacity to stop smoking somewhere in you. Sometimes it's not easy to find, but it's there. This internet stranger believes in you!

Smoked for 17 years, off and on, and I'm 5 days Smoke Free!

I tried my first cigarette at age 15. It was terrible but felt "cool". That turned into social smoking.... Smoking only when I drank alcohol... Smoking when I worked in restaurants... Smoking to deal with stress... Smoking to avoid eating... Smoking to cool off after an argument... Smoking to make a phone call... Smoking just to smoke. I quit when I got pregnant with my daughter and didn't smoke for a year and 2 months. I had gained a ridiculous amount of weight and thought smoking would get me back down. It did... Because I used it as a meal substitute. My daughter is now almost 7. She asked me to quit... She begged me through tears... And she is my main motivation. I did it for her once. I'm going to do it for now... For good. Once I got past the shakes, nausea, headaches and irritability I felt pretty freaking great. Routine is the hardest part for me now. I'm trying to substitute exercise, water drinking, and drawing for smoking. Day 5 and in it for the long haul!

3 Months

I made it three months, which is the longest I've gone in many many quit attempts over the last couple years.  I've been feeling good.  Still get cravings here and there (especially related to Summertime activities that I haven't done since I was smoking last year.)  I'm trying to be hyper vigilant right now as I've quit for longer than this in the past and still slipped up.  I just want to be done.

I've used an e-cig for the last 3 months, gradually stepping down my nicotine levels and usage.  I'm currently at the 6 mg and plan to switch even lower after this bottle of juice is gone and then to reduce usage until I can be completely nicotine free.

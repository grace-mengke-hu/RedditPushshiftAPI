Five days! I'm feeling really good, nothing could get me to light up right now.

Hey everyone! Just checking in. It's been five days since I've quit. It hasn't been easy thats for sure. If you've read a few of my earlier posts, I was a smoker for roughly 10 years. The ages of 17 - 28. I did quit once in that time for two years!

The first time I quit seemed so easy. This time trying to quit has been a nightmare. It started about three years ago. I've been pushing the date back, stopping for a day or two, pushing it back again. It's been a few years of that now. 

This is the longest I think I have gone without a cigarette in about six months to a year. Honestly I have quit so many times that I can't even remember exactly.

All I know is that right now not a thing in the world could get me to light another one. In the last five days I have been through a rough argument with the SO on valentines day, failed a test the next day due to the stress, and even went out drinking with friends! Not one time during these stressful situations did I smoke (but I definitely thought about it!). 

I want to thank everyone in this sub for their kind comments and support. It's been a great help! Keep not smoking everyone.

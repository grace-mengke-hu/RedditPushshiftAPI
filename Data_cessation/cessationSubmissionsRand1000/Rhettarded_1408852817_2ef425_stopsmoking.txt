Non-smoker as of today. 10.1 on the beep test... See how I improve in a week.

Decided that every time I want to smoke I will get down and do push ups or sit ups or go for a run. Anything. 

Can't use nicotine replacement at all.  Tried everything and I have a reaction to it all.  

I don't want to smoke. So I won't. Let's get fit for the first time in 9 years!

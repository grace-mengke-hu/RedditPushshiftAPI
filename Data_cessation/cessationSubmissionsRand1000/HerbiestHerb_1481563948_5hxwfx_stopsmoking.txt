I Hate This Habit

I'm going to make this short. I smoked an ungodly amount of cigarettes on Saturday night. Christmas party + copious amounts of alcohol = recipe for disaster. The only thing that is going to make this work for me is to stop everything that makes me want to smoke. I can't drink, therefore I won't smoke. I have to deal with stress better and not take the easy road out and smoke a cigarette. I've got to deal with my stress instead of masking it. I've just got to build better habits. I can. I will.  That's all I got for the time being.

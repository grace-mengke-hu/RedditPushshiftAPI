So I saw the back of my teeth yesterday

For the first time in my life, I saw the back of my teeth in the mirror. It was DISGUSTING. Yellow and brown and black everywhere.

That's enough for me, I'm done. I'm quitting smoking. I managed to have my teeth cleant this morning. They are nice, they'll stay nice :)

Today I saw a wet used butt on the ground, and it triggered a craving. WTF?

I'm a month in. I don't think that would have tempted me even during the first week. Having such a strong craving after seeing that was discouraging. All this after I almost cracked yesterday...

I don't know what's going on. Is this normal? I'd like to make it clear that I don't like cigarettes or miss them, so I don't think it's that.

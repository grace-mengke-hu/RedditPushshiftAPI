Feeling bad that it's been so easy, almost like I don't belong here with all the sufferers.

I quit 22 days ago using step 2 of the patch. I used it for about 2 weeks and then hopped off that and went to 2mg Nicorette gum. (lots of 2's... weird) 

I've been accidentally off the gum for 3 days, the day before that I had only 1 piece. (I forgot about it one day and just kept it going from there)
I've been drinking, going to fairs, concerts, hanging out with smokers, vacations. I'm driving to work, taking my lunch breaks, eating my dinner without giving smoking a second thought. WHY?!
I'm having such an easy time I feel bad even lurking around on this sub.

I just feel so done, so over it.  I also haven't had too much stress for once in my life. Perfect timing for that. However, there were times when I wanted to rip my significant others face off and my first thought was surprisingly NOT a cigarette. That's so fucked up to me. The last 3942394 times I quit any time anger brewed up my brain shut off and went right to GIVE ME A CIGGARETTE. But now, I don't even know where it goes, but it's not there. 

I wish I could give my 'I'm done' feeling to everyone else struggling. My attitude is different this time around, I WANTED to quit. All the other times I quit because that's what your 'supposed' to do, but I wasn't ready. I don't regret smoking, I had my fun, smoked my smokes for the last 15 years and now I'm just over it. Fuck those things. 
I'm not a smoker.

Another 1st

Yo everyone! I'm posting alot at the moment as there is alot of firsts for me and most people i know are either 1. Non smokers (and never have smoked) 2. Smokers. Therefore I'm like the only one in my circle of friends who is/has done this whole quitting marlarky! Therefore most people i know, whilst are very supportive, don't really 'get' it.

So last night i went to a mates and had a few beers. This is a trigger for me usually, however i did not smoke anything, hurrah! Bizarrely i was more aware of how easy it could of been but also how ridiculous it would of been to smoke. I have never felt this way before. In 15 years i have never drank alcohol and not smoked. Don't get me wrong, I'm not gonna test the trigger again anytime soon bt it's a great feeling to have 1 positive memory with friends, beers and no cigs (for me) involved. It's given me some extra resolve that this is the right thing to do! Also waking up today, i feel so fresh, on reflection 80-90% of my post-drinking feelings appear to be smoking related. Again doesn't mean I'm gonna go alcohol mad (i want to avoid swapping one behaviour for another) bt it's the stark realisation of how much smoking impacts me physically, mentally, emotionally. You read and hear about it all, bt experience has shown me more, hands down. And what i have learnt this time around....How much more of this is in my head. So today starts of positively! Good luck to everyone today wherever you are in your journey x

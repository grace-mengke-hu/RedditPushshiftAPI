A week, this may be the quit to end all quits!

Holy fucking shit, a week, I've only managed to do this once before, back in November, then I gave in to an offer from my friends in a very zoned out depressed moment. 

Tomorrow I'll actually break my all time record, WOWWOWOWOW

But now I'm not depressed, I seem to have no strong desire to go back to smoking, Infact, I seem even more happier without it now.

I think what has helped destroy my previous love for smoking is the horrendous withdrawal I just came out of from other the weekend, literally was in my bed sweating and shaking with a runny nose and a headache thinking I needed a fag, if you'd seen me you would've thought I was coming down off heroin, fuck knows if I just got a heavy cold at the wrong time just as I was quitting or if that was actually related.

Anyhow, it was so fucking bad it's helped put me off majorly ever smoking a cigarette again. Along with the financial costs of it too.

I still smoke some weed every other day that my friends smoke, which has tobacco rolled in with it, as is the custom in Europe, so technically I have smoked it in this time but I don't count that, I'm not going out of my way to smoke it.

But I must remain vigilant, its not so bad when I'm sober, I still get cravings now and again in the day but I'm able to shut them down quickly like I did yesterday. 

This Saturday there's a local big music festival that's going to be happening where me and my friends are all gonna be under the influence of some substances.

I've managed to just about fight off my cravings when I got drunk last weekend, but this is going to be the BIG challenge for me, as its tradition now I smoke when I do this stuff.

But as I said the desire to smoke has been dampened quite a bit within me, I feel me returning to the anti smoking mentality I had before I started, so I know I can do it, if I can, then the last major battle of this war has been won, and I think I may just be able to quit for good.

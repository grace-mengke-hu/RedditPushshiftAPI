Pressure Situation.

I’m retired and my life has much less pressure than when I was working. Today, just suffice to say, I was in a pressure situation all day long. I have been smoke free for 197 days but I haven’t really been under a day full of pressure since I quit smoking. I came away with the strongest urge I’ve had since the first few days. I almost caved. But I am happy to say I am still smoke free! Wish me luck for tomorrow because I will be in the same shape tomorrow. Stay strong people!

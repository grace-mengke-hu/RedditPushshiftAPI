Day 6: No smokes - No Drinks

Got to sleep in this morning a bit. The cravings have really begun to leave the system and didn't even really think about smoking this morning. Last night had a few cravings but made some tea and watched a show, The 100, on Netflix. 

Another beautiful day! Time to make some breakfast and go cuddle in a cloud of blankets and pillows with the girlfriend. Today I will not smoke with you! Have an awesome day!

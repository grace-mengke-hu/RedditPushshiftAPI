3 weeks - Longest nicotine-free in 5 years and still going!

I'm almost at the one month mark. My lung capacity and taste/smell are already much better. Even my skin seems healthier - especially in my face. I've been gaining weight though, some of my cravings have been replaced with eating a little unhealthier, but that can be remedied.

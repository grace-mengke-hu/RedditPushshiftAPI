Struggling

Been trying to quit since last month but failing. Still smoke everyday but every time I do, I just hate it. Though I have significantly reduced how many I smoke a day, I really want to try to not smoke for a day but it's been really trying! My brothers smoke and whenever I have a craving I can't fight, I find myself taking their cigarettes. 

I have also read Easyway and it has indeed helped to change my perspective on smoking. But not so much since I still continue to smoke. Any advice? Could use the extra boost/push to quit once and for all.

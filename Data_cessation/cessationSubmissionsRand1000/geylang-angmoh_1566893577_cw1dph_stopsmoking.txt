Hey, I used to be a smoker too

And now, two months (66 days) smoke free, I think it’s time when I do think about smoking but can’t call it a craving.

Sometimes I want to smoke, but it’s just a thought that has no power, and I don’t have to struggle over it - it just passes, like any other thought.

If you’re in your early days, just hang in there a little longer and the grip of addiction will loosen up and fade away like just the smoke of your last cigarette. Just win the battle today, and another one tomorrow, and soon enough you’ll win the war, and coping will get easier.

Also, according to an online calculator, I saved up around 150$ so far which is very good.

I don’t really miss smoking. I didn’t lose anything when I quit. I don’t need it in my life. In fact, quitting helped me gain a thing or two - sense of smell, that money I saved, a better breath and a bit of health. I feel much better in the gym now, and blowing off steam doing exercise is way more satisfying than by sucking on a fag around the corner.

Stay strong and enjoy the smoke free life!

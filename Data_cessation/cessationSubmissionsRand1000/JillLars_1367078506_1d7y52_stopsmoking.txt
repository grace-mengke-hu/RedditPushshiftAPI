I quit today.

After hacking up a lung last night I decided to pick up a box of nicotine patches and give quitting another try.  I started smoking about 8 years ago (when I was 22, who does that?)  I quit once before for almost a year (362 days), and have tried off/on a few times since then.  Hoping it sticks this time.

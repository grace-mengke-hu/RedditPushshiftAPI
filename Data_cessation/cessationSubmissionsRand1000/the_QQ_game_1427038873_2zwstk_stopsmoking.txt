Haven't been this far since I relapsed

So.. I thought I'd be out of the woods at some point but I'm dwelling. This is my first day off from work since this streak started and all I'm thinking about is smoking.

My worst fits were yesterday.. A day beyond what I was expecting. In the past this was always my excuse to go back.. "You don't want me like THIS do you?." I've almost quit my job.. I've damaged a relationship that was nearly fight-free prior to my quit, etc. Now I'm in my apartment trying to dry out (that sounds pretty dramatic, oh well). 

I'm fantasizing about a smoke and the difficult thing to come to grips with is the desire for self-destruction. There are numerous ways to justify wanting to quit for your health but if you want to hurt yourself and pout it seems hard to argue with. 

I really can't trust my thoughts. I wonder if I ever could.

This is just me whining. I've made it this far. For now, I won't be choking myself.

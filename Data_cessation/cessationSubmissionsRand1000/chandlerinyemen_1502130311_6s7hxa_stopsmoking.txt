Mind Games

Every time I get the idea to smoke or a craving hits, I've been telling myself, like "oh yeah, I don't do that anymore"...for me it helps to try to be nonchalant about it and try to trick myself into believing that it's no big deal.

Do you guys play any mind games with yourselves that help resist cravings??

4 days in, really worried about relapse

4 days in using videos from WhyQuit, has anyone else used these successfully? Finding them helpful, but still having cravings and part of my brain wants to trick me back into smoking again, thinking  how lovely “just one” would be. Had my first beer since stopping today and that was intense cravings, and was doing a lot of work in the evening so when I finished that that was a strong craving as well! 

I am feeling fairly confident about managing cravings at home and have been ok so far, but I’m visiting my family this weekend and two of them smoke which I’m really nervous about. Have tried to give up a lot before and most times I visit them I end up taking a cigarette and getting hooked again. Also I know I will be drinking alcohol on at least one day as it’s a bank holiday weekend which makes it even harder. Any tips?

What prompted you to smoke? and how you stopped the same from dragging you back into the mess

Hi there, 
i am pretty new to reddit and this stop smoking subreddit. In my other post i was wondering how could this community help me in getting rid of smoking and people were magnanimous enough to share their thoughts on it . 
coming to smoking i started smoking during college years so that i am not thought of as douche bag, and it has continued from that day .Some days it would be  15 some days 20 some days 5 ,  but after about 4 years of struggle,i now fear that if i don't stop smoking i would not be able to continue to enjoy my life. 
**TL DR**

**Long story short.**

* What prompted you to smoke ?
* answer - College , trying not to be a douche bag
* 2) what are the times you are most prone to smoke?
* answer- Nowadays in office , its the time when you are done with the work , in the evening . Walking back home  from office , i always end up in the nearby shop lighting myself.
*3) What are you doing to avoid breaking down in this time ?
* answer- Need your help

What's the badge thing? (Quit yesterday! Yay)

Hi guys! This is actually my first reddit post ever.. I've been lurking for awhile. I had my last cigarette yesterday at 9 am. I've been vaping and feeling really good about not smoking cigs. My cravings come and go just as quickly and for some reason my mind and body just seem with it this time around. I'm wondering about this "badge" thing I keep seeing... Can someone explain it to me? :)

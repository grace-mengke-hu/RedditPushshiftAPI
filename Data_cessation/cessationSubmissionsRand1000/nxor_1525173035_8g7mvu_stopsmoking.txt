A FEKKIN YEAR!

I can't believe it. The first two months I had the occasional thought for a smoke, but after that time just flew past (maybe I am just getting older and it feels that way!). I am so happy and proud, and bought myself a nice set of Mackie speakers to remind me of my success.

I never thought I could be like the other people in this sub and feel what I read they feel, but here I am!

Thanks to the best sub in the universe, past, present and future!

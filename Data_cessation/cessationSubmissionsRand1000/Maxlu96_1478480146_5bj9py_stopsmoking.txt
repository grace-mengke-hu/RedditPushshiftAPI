The cigarette industry seems like an emotionless giant that we can not harm, that laughs at our weakness...

But whenever you feel like you cant harm it, take a look at badgebot. Combined, the users of this subreddit alone have not smoked for 24.461.911 days. Realistically, let us make that 20 million (without those who caved in and never disabled their badges). With an estimated average of 5USD spent on cigarettes per day, we alone cost the industry over a 100 million dollars. 

Is that not amazing? And each and every one of us not only contributed to that, but contributes to it with every single second of our lives. Every single second of sleeping, eating, showering - not smoking - hurts our common enemy. And I know we all are willed to make him suffer, make him bleed, fight him on all fronts. So let us not see ourselves as victims of it, but as soldiers standing side by side to fight it. Let us spread the word, help other people to stop, support each other and grow our community. So we hurt them even more, just like they hurt us.

I believe in every single one of you.

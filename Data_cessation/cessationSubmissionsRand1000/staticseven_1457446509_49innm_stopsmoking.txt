Day 2 - smashed it

Hi guys,
I don't really ever use reddit but at the moment I feel like I need all the help I can get so lets try this too. After lapsing back into smoking 18 months ago after 4 years smoke free I'm finally in a place where I really, truly want to quit. Hate it, it makes me feel dreadful, it's expensive, my lungs/ribs actually hurt a bit, all the usual stuff.
So here goes. 2 days under the belt. Haven't committed homicide yet, and haven't eaten everything in my house.

I'm just about to do a 2 week youth theatre project. If anything will test my resolve it'll be that.

I don't know what I expect from this thing but maybe firing my withdrawal ramblings out into the void might be useful.

Twelve hours smoke free cold turkey and I need some help figuring out if the addiction is playing tricks on me.

I've been reading the posts here to help me get through and stay motivated.  Lots of people here say that cold turkey isn't a good way to quit, but I know that if I have cigarettes around me I won't have the willpower to just smoke a couple a day. 
Now I'm wondering if I should just go to the store and buy a pack and try to ration them. Will that make me a successful nonsmoker?  Is that the addicition talking or is it clear and rational thinking?

I just read what I wrote, and answered my own question.  Fuck you addiction! I'm not going to the store!

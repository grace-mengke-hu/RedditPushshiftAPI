I ate ALL THE POP TARTS... AGAIN.

but I am 58 days smoke free.  

Never thought I could do this, but I'm doing it.
Come-on Saturday... gotta get to 60!!!!

Been slipping up with exercise a bit and eating like chit, but I'm still fighting the good fight. Still using the NRT - but less. 
Went to the dentist - gums are apparently way healthier and no mouth cancer or weirdness - definite win. 

I'm doing it.

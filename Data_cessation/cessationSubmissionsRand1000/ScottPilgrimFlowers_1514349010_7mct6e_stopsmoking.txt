Slipped. Won’t let it stop me.

After nearly two months smoke free I slipped tonight. Found a cigarette while cleaning the house, waited for the wife to fall asleep then went outside in subzero temps to smoke it. It was disgusting. It did not make me happy. It did not bring back any of those good feelings I romanticize about with smoking. 

But I put it out with the same intention I had when I quit.  With a determined and positive energy. I will not feel bad about this, I will just be more mindful that I still have some kinks to work out as a nonsmoker. Because I am. I will not buy a pack tomorrow or the rest of the week or at all next year. I will not smoke with you in 2018. Here’s to progress.

Lying about being quit.

I was one of those "new year quitters" I went from one pack and a half a day to zero cold turkey for three weeks, but now I've started smoking 2 cigarettes a day mainly went I am alone going to work. The thing is that I've told everybody that I've quit so, I can't smoke around people anymore. My husband used to smoke. He is super cool. I know I could start smoking at my usual rate tomorrow and he would mind, but I don't want to let him down. In a way a think that lying about me being quit sorta helps me smoke less since I have to keep up the lie. I am at square one again. It's been 12 hours since my last cigarette and I want to stay quit this time... for real. 

Have you ever experienced something like this?

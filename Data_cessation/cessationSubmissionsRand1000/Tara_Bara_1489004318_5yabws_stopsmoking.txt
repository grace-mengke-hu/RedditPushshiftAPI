Newbie here!

I've been browsing this forum the past 3 days, which is when I stopped smoking. The first day was surprisingly easy, but yesterday and especially today, I've been really struggling. I find myself bargaining with my addiction more and more ("I'll just quit again tomorrow," etc.) Of course, I've said that a LOT of times. 

I'm trying to learn to accept the cravings as part of being what I am...an addict. To one degree or another, craving cigarettes is part of who I am now. I keep telling myself to take things one day (or craving) at a time. I've been smoking since I was 18, am now 37, and to all you youngins out there, let me assure you...it catches up to you. The sooner you stop, the easier it'll be to quit and easier on your health too.

Anyways, just wanted to introduce myself!

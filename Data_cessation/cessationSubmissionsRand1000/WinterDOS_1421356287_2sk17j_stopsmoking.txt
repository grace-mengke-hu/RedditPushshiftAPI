Quit meter with beer statistics.

I stopped drinking when I quit smoking. I felt the two went hand in hand like hand in glove for me. I calculated I drank on average 2.4 beers per day and calculated the cost of a beer at $1.50 per beer. That added up to $3.60 per day. I decided to add that cost to my Quit smoking money save statistics. Now the money is stacking up lots quicker and just bought myself a reward (Polar M400 GPS watch, highly recommended).

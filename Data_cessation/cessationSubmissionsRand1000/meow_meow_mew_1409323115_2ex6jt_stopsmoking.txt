Here we go again!

And hopefully for the last time ever.  I'm hoping that a holiday weekend with non-smokers who I would never smoke around anyway will help me get over the 3 day hump.  

I have a 4 hour drive today though and I'm worried.  I hope that doing something so challenging (driving is one of my biggest triggers) early on will make it easier later.  Thoughts? 

P.S. y'all are awesome and the reason I will never quit quitting.

To the Ex-Smokers, how long does it take until you notice you're health is vastly improved?

I'm about a week in and notice I'm not as tired and there isn't as much mucus in my throat. My breath is getting better, but not back to 100% yet. This also can be said about my chest, it still feels a little heavy. Anyone else experience this or worse?

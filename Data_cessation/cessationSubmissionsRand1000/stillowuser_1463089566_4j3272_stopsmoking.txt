Introduction quitting!!

I am not sure how everybody on this subreddit feels about using vaping to quit smoking. I saw a post while I was lurking about quitting vaping. I got my "e-cigarette" last Tuesday and I immediately cut back on cigarettes I've smoked as little as 1 a day since and no more than 4 a day. Which is fantastic considering I was up to a pack a day before I got my device. I starts at 12mg and I've already cut down to 6mg nicotine. I haven't smoked at all today. Each cigarette tastes worse than the last and I hoping to cut them out completely followed by cutting out nicotine. 

I've been smoking for 10 years and started when I was 13. I tried to quit many times but I finally got to a point where i was just done being a slave to a filthy habit. But i still felt like a slave. A family member bought it for me and I've been doing very well! I feel the urge to smoke less and less every day.

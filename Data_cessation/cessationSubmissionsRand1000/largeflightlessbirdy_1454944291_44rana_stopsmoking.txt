Rough week

Having a rough week. Co-worker is having health problems and all of her incomplete reports have ended up on my desk for completion, girlfriend has nerve damage and every 5-10 minutes screams out in pain wherever we are. Difficult to sleep, difficult to get anything done at home because the woman i love is screaming in pain in the next room.

I miss those 10 minute respites that smoking gave you from your day. I know that nicotine isn't good for relieving stress, but having a neat reason that didn't raise any eyebrows to step outside every couple of hours and just have a few minutes to yourself is sorely missed. 

253 days in and this is the closest i've been to cracking :(

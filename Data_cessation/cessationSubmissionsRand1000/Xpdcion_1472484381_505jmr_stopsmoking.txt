I am having a long drive with my friends who smokes more than me

Okay so basically, I am at a state of panic. I just realized that I am going out with people who smokes more than me, and will be stuck with them for 2-3 days. I've been nicotine free for a week. I don't think I'll be able to hold the temptation since they pretty much smoke inside the car.

Is there any way I can cope without  canceling the plan?

Weight gain

How much weight did you gain when you quit?  Stepped on the bathroom scale at my Mom's house (I don't own one) and am quite disgusted with myself.

Edit: thanks for all your responses. In the year leading up to this quit I had lost weight & gone down in clothing sizes; I had been feeling pretty pleased with myself.  Not that I'm not pleased at quitting....  But damn, to gain it all back (and then some) in a matter of weeks - that hurts!

A letter to 15-year-old self

I wish somebody told me this:

Smoking is inhaling poison and exhaling a smell of a rotting dumpster. You are hurting your entire body with each inhalation of the poison. 
Smoking can feel good not because smoking is good by itself. That's a lie of the addiction. You feel a relief when you smoke because you get withdrawals. Withdrawals are very unpleasant. By smoking more we relieve withdrawals. Relief feels good. 
We call the same things habits, bad habits, addictions. By repetition, we form addictions aka habits. Performing the acts of habit is comfortable.

When you think of having a cigarette to indulge yourself, to enjoy a guilty pleasure, think of self-harm that you induce on yourself because of the addiction. Feel the sadness that instead of treating yourself to something good, you act under a spell and you harm yourself very directly with an intention of indulgence. 
Feel the sadness when you think you can enjoy a cigarette after a hard day of work. The lie of addiction makes you enjoy the poison and self-harm. 

The act of self-love is to resist this insanity

Stopping, starting, and stopping again. Sick of it. I'm putting an end to this cycle

I have tried to quit more times in the last few months than I can even count.  I have gone 10 days, 2 days, 4 days, 3 days, and so on.  I am using the gum and that has really helped but I am getting tired of this round and round game.  I smoked my last cigarette 9 hours ago, and I can already feel that my withdrawal is worse now because I smoked last evening (and I smoked a lot).

Does anyone else have any similar experiences?  I'm not giving up guys.  I know where I went wrong last night and I am going to avoid making that mistake again.

Thanks for the continued support

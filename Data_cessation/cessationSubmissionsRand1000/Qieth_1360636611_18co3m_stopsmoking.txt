This week has been difficult

The first two weeks of quitting smoking went a lot better than expected. It wasnt easy to go from 20 to 0, but I did it. Last week, I even made a post about how easy I thought this whole thing was. 

But as if irony just decides to stop by, these last 5-7 days have been really difficult.

I had a major discussion with my boss on Tuesday. I was so pissed at her, but I had absolutely no reason to. As I thought it through Tuesday evening, I ended up being embarrassed over my behavior. I apologized on Wednesday and we had a little chat. We both agreed that it was pretty out of character for me, and she was understanding - she knows that I'm quitting the smokes, but that should never be an excuse. 

On Wednesday and Thursday, I ended up being sick. I had Thursday and Friday off, so that "fit perfectly". And as I was wallowing in self pity over being sick, my mind went to the cigarettes. 

But worst of all, in the last 5 days or so, I haven't been able to get smokes out of my mind. I think a lot more about cigarettes than I did last week. I even DREAM about them. I dream that I have one puff and then throw it away. I wake up with a "to hell with it, it's all ruined!"-attitude, and it's not before I "get up to have a cig" that I realize it was a dream. I still haven't smoked, but it's messing with my brains, man. 

Last but not least, my lungs have been hurting. Not a lot, just a little pull, as if they are suddenly craving nicotine again. They are worse this week than last week. I mean, what gives?!

I have really been thinking a lot about smoking. Still haven't had a smoke, though, probably out of sheer stubbornness, but I'm finding it pretty difficult to deal with all of a sudden. 

Sigh. Thanks for letting me rant.

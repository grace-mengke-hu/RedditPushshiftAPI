Day 1

Started smoking when I was 17. I am now 19 and after smoking a few dozen "last cigarettes" over the past year, I have finally smoked my last last cigarette. No e-cig this time either. Fuck nicotine. My battle with depression is not over, but I've accepted that cigarettes have only played a negative role through it all. Currently washing my jackets and clothes. Smells like change to me.

I think I'm Finally a "non-smoker"

So I've been hanging out with some friends and they all smoke. We've been outside and they have been smoking it up. Not once have I wanted one. The smell hasn't triggered any emotional response in me. The junky in my head is quiet this evening. I am so grateful this. I am so happy to be not smoking with all of you today. I didn't cough this morning when I woke up. Life is good and it gets better every day.

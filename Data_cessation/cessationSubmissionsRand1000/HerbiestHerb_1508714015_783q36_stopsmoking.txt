8 days

8 days smoke free. I can attribute a lot of my success to the fact that Iâ€™ve been working out every day that I have remained quit. Nothing too extreme. Just doing a ton of walking,  push-ups and pull-ups.  I refuse to go back to smoking cigarettes again. I enjoy how it feels to be a non smoker more than I ever enjoyed smoking. Any one can quit smoking if they really want to. Keep it up everyone.

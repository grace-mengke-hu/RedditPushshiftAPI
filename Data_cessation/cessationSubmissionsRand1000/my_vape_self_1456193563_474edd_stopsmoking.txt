So who is using nicotine right now? A quick side bar please....

This is a re-post from [last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/2wnm8e/a_quick_note_for_anyone_using_nrt/).  I thought I might mark an important anniversary with it.

----------------------------


Everyone is welcome to read, but this is a special short note to those using nicotine to quit.

I lit my last cigarette on 2/20/2014.  2/21/2014 was my first day without smoking in ten years. ***One Year!***  

In about 5 weeks, I'll celebrate my year free of nicotine as well.

* However you set your badge, you'll have two anniversaries.  Celebrate them both.  They are each important.

* If you are on this path, keep walking.  It can produce non smokers.

* If you sense any negativity about the nicotine from others, it is because they don't think you *need* the nicotine to quit.  When you think about it, that is actually a nice thought.

* Once people quit nicotine, all the stay-quit struggles are the same.

*Onward!*

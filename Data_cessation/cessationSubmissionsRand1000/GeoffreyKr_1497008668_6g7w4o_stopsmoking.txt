Quit smoking app ?

Hi,
What if an app could help you quit smoking (by smart coaching and more), would you :
1) Use it if i's free 2) I would be ok to pay a one-time fee 3) I would consider paying a small monthly subscription (a few bucks) 4) I won't use it, I don't like app
Thanks a lot for your help

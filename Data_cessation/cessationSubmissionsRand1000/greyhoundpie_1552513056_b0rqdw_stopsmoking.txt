I'm so fatigued...

Hi friends. 10 days or so smoke free. I get the same amount of sleep as before (6-7 hours) but I feel so tired/fatigued most days. My arms and my legs are tired all day. I work a physical job so it's not ideal.. I'm on a 14mg patch (step 2).

What do you guys think? Does this have anything to do with not smoking or am I just tired for some other reason?

I'm a freaking blood bag!

Ever since quitting (1 week ago, thankyouverymuch!), the circulation in my body has been inSANE! As in, everything below the knee has been sore and tingly. I can literally feel the blood pooling in my feet. Which is great and all, but also kinda creepy (as in "what the heck was happening BEFORE I quit?").

But seriously, anything having to do with blood grosses me out. I read your circulation levels out around 10 days to 2 weeks. Is this right? Anyone else  experience this and know what's going on/what to expect?

Thanks

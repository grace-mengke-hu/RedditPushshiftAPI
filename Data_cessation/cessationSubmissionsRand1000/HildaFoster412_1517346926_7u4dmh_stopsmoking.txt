Feeling Proud!

I am 37. I started smoking in my teens and, by the time I was 18 and living by myself, I was already totally addicted. I was already regularly trying to quit all the time and failing all the time. Needless to say, my self esteem and self conception did not benefit from this never ending chain of failures. 

When I was 27 I moved to a city (and a social environment) with way less smoke. Also I was living with my now husband (then boyfriend) who has never been a smoker. I quit for 9 months and then relapsed. It took me another 10 years of failed attempts to get where I am now. I’ve quit 5 months and a few days ago, but I do know that I have worked so much through my addiction that I can be now confident when I say I quit. 

I don’t get to have any recognition for this. I have already tried and failed too many other times for that. Many people in my life think I quit years ago. My husband (understandably) cannot be as enthusiastic as he was the first few times. My being proud of myself somehow gets stifled for lack of chances to get out. It is weird because the fact that I failed so many times is at the same time what makes my achievement significant for me and non-credible to others.

So... I just feel I want to take this moment to give credit to myself!

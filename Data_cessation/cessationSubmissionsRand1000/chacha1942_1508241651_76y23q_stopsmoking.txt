Day 2 - work

Day was spent whirling about. I didn't stop moving. I went to the gym when I woke up at 5am. For a 50 min walk at 4pm. And back to the steam/sauna at 7pm. 

I also worked my ass off. I was short with people and I knew it, but I wasn't ugly and I made sure to let folks know I didn't mean to be an asshole.

And I didn't smoke.

Today I won't either.

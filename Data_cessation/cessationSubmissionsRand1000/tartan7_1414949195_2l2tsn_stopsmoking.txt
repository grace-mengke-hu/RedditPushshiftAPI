Quitting with Nicotine Patches. Good? Bad?

Someone mentioned that by using NRT (nicotine replacement therapy) a person isn't "dealing with their addiction" and that once they get off of it, it's going to bother them a lot.

This is the longest I've ever been able to go without smoking cigarettes. Cold turkey I lasted about two weeks last time. I use nicotine patches. 

I'm on the second stage now and I was even able to go to a party, drink, and not want a cigarette (which is amazing!). I'm just worried that maybe all this progress I'm seeing with my quit isn't real or it isn't going to last once I'm done with the patches.

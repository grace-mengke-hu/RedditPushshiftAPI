2 weeks, cold turkey

I don't know what it is, but I'm just chilling, excited about my future. I had a mini-craving today because shit went down at work and all I could think about was getting out of the office. Instead, I looked outside and it was snowing and sleeting. So I said screw that. Next test: the holidays and the 5 hour drive. I used to smoke the whole way up. I'm pumped to test myself... or I guess realize this is my new reality. It's kind of cool.

150 days: Finality as I haven't felt before this quit.

150  days….. I came on here just to check, this being the only place I have an accurate counter running. I check now because I’ve been feeling an extra bit of finality when I pass smokers on the street. Instead of a moment of mischievous want, or jovial “Nuh uh! Dun want!”, or even a grave “You mustn't”, I feel a final sense that that can never be me again.

It’s hard to describe that finality. It’s as much about choice as anything. I look at the cigarette being smoked and I realize I can never make that choice again. I can’t, and I won’t, and that is what is best for me and my life. I’m not sitting here preaching I have beaten the addiction; I have not. Yet there is a growing sense and sensibility within me that is very clearly saying never again. NOPE. Not one puff ever. 

I hope you find yourself sometime in your quit having a similar realization, that this quit, this attempt is the one that is going to stick forever. I never want to smoke another cigarette in my life, and that thought makes me… satisfied. And satisfied about a lifetime sans cigarettes is the goal here, yes? 

I wish you all a happy quit. Keep on realizing just how fucking awful cigarettes are to your life, and to the things you wish to be, and achieve. Mix that with substantially growing the time between your last puff till now, and you’ll be well on the way to satisfaction. 

Fuck cigarettes.

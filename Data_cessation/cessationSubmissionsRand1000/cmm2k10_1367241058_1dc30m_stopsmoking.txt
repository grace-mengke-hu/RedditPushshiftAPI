3 WEEKS

I haven't smoked for 3 weeks! Once again I smoked for 15 years. I have never felt better in my life and I have never been more proud of myself! I can honestly say I am done I have no desire to smoke, and I did this cold turkey. I am now training to run my first 5k. I cant wait to reach all my new goals. To all of you just starting on day 1 you can do this it is mind over matter.. thats all! You will not regret it!

I came close today.. TOO CLOSE!

6 days smoke free and I honestly believed that the worse is behind me.

Today I was on an empty stomach and had to drive my sis an hour away. We had a fight on the way. Once I got her there and went back home she called me to go get her back because the plans were fucked. And uber/taxi aren't safe in that part of town.

So another one hour drive, still on an empty stomach, and to top it all off a dog literally jumped infront of my car, making me swerve and in turn making the car on the other side swerve. Almost had a fatal accident. And still hungry.

I stopped in the side of the road and asked a random smoker for a cigarette. He gladly gave it away and I was on my way before remember I don't have a lighter. I was 20 minutes away from the nearest market and I wasn't carrying any money. So I threw it out of the window in frustration (sorry for littering).

I'm now wined and dined. The intense brain burning cravings are gone. And I'm glad I haven't lit it.

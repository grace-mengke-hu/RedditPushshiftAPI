Those who used NRT, help?

I haven't smoked a cigarette in 27 hours.  This is the longest I have gone since my last attempt 2 months ago in which I went cold turkey but ended up breaking half of the stuff in my house over a 7 day period.  I decided this quit I needed help because I simply cannot function with the cravings.  I suffer from panic disorder and anxiety as it is, quitting smoking for me without nicotine gum is pure hell that was putting my relationships and mental health under extreme stress.

I smoked an average of 10 American Spirits a day, sometimes more if I drank (which I have since quit).  Some days I could go as low as 4 or 5 if I was with my fiancee hanging out all day.  I have been smoking for 15 years more or less.

Since I quit yesterday at noon, I have been chewing 2mg nicotine gum every 2-3 hours.  I am starting to feel agitated, dizzy, can't' concentrate, lethargic, etc.  Am I not chewing enough gum or is the mg not high enough?  I admit the gum helps take the edge off.  The last time on day 2 I was a complete emotional wreck.  But I am concerned maybe this early on I am not chewing enough or the dose isn't right.  How did you use the gum or NRT, any suggestions on my regimen?

I am thankful I am quitting.  I am vowing to myself no matter how I feel, no matter what happens, this is my final quit.  Failure is not an option

For those who have failed with Allen Carr, This is how you succeed!

Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

A little bit of background about myself. I was one of people who read the allen carr book and quit smoking for a time but eventually I messed up by having one cigarette and couldn't quit again. I read the book 100 times times across a 2 year period and I didnt manage to quit. Yesterday I read the book again and I am happy to say with confidence that I am a non smoker now. 

&amp;#x200B;

So how did I achieve this? There was one point that didnt stick to me, even though I knew, understood, pretty memorised and believed every other point in the book. It is this:

&amp;#x200B;

**Even if you feel bad during the withdrawal period, it doesnt mean that the book didnt work, that you still have some of the brain washing or that you are a smoker still. Stress and withdrawal symptoms are a natural part of the quitting process. You are still free and HAPPY to be a non smoker EVEN IF YOU FEEL MISERABLE.**

It helps if you think about it this way:

&amp;#x200B;

**The only days that count in life are the days where you are down or struggling against an obstacle and you persist and get closer to your goals. Savour these days, rejoice when you are feeling down for you are growing. You dont need to feel good to be a non smoker. Time is inevitable, Each moment you improve whether you feel good or not! Each moment you are more and more free from the trap!**

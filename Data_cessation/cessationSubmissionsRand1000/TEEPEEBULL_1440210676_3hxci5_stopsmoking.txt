Smoking again after a long Quit

My sister came over earlier tonight for a visit and during the course of conversation, she told me that she started smoking again. I was kinda in shock! She had quit about 20 years ago!
I asked her why and she said "stress".

Now I just dropped the topic at that point, but, I wondered to my self- she had raised 2 boys, gone through the death of Dad, and many other life events that happen over the course of the last 20 years, and now she says she started again over "stress".

Anybody run across a long time quit that was lost? For whatever reason?

I am a nonsmoker today.

I'm done - I don't want to do it any more.  I don't want to wake up feeling shitty.  I don't want the smoker's cough.  I don't want to stand outside in the freezing cold or blazing sun for the morning & afternoon smoke breaks.  I don't want to be a bad example for my kids.  I don't want to get winded & out of breath when I play.  I don't want to keep wasting money.  I don't want to feel the constant "need" for a cigarette.  I want my life back.

Edit:  Thank you all for the kind words & encouragement.  I stumbled across this subreddit a month or so ago.   Reading through your threads/stories has inspired me.  Thank you for that, too!

Day 16, one of my hardest days yet.

I felt like totally giving up today. A lot of depression and anxiety and anger. My jaw aches from clenching.

I didn't smoke, and didn't even actually consider stopping at one of the dozen gas stations I passed on the way home tonight, but goddamn I feel crazy. I'm sitting here chomping on sunflower seeds and sucking down beers.

I really hope this is just the withdrawals still and that I haven't gone completely nuts.

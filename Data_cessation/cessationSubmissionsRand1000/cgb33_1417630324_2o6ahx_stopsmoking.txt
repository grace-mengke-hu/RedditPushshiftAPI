I miss going outside

Hi!
I really miss going outside. It gave me a break, it gave me fresh air, it gave me a chance to unwind a bit.
I don't miss smoking & I don't miss being out in the cold but I do miss going outside several times a day.
I don't really know what to do on my breaks if I were to go outside. Any suggestions?
Thanks for listening.

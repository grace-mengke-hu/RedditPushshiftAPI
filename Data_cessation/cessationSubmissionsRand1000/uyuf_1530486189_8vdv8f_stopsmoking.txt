Almost caved last night. Never get complacent.

I'm just over 4 months in now and I have to say the last month or so has just been a breeze. I've barely thought about smoking at all, and I started to think that it was just getting easy. However, last night after some very strong depressive feelings I almost convinced myself to go and buy a packet of cigarettes and simply say "fuck it" to all the progress I've made. (When I say "almost", I mean there was about a 50&amp;#37; chance of it going either way.)

Today I signed up for my local gym (I haven't been going since I returned home from university for the summer) and tonight I went and I feel excellent, but very stupid. I feel stupid that last night I was what seemed like a hair's width away from relapsing back into my old ways. I guess what I can take away from this is that even when the physical withdrawal subsides, the psychological ties to nicotine are still present but entirely invisible. They can lie dormant in your mind, showing no signs of activity for months, and then erupt in an evening tempting you devilishly to regress. 

I'm disappointed in myself for seeing smoking as an option. But I'm glad I was successful at not caving in. Smoking is never the solution.

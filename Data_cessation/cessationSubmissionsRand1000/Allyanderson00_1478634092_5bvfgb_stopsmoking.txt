Day 8 - Really wanted to buy some this afternoon

Hi, day 8 here and it's going ok, the cravings are less frequent and the habits are breaking, overall I'm really pleased. This afternoon however I really wanted to smoke, I know the drill as I've read Allen Carr's books loads of times but I just wanted to go buy a pack and smoke. I was at work at the time which for me, is the best place to be so I didn't buy any and went straight to the gym after work. I'm fine now but jeez it was close.

Funny how that little fucker inside can twist things around.

Stay strong people

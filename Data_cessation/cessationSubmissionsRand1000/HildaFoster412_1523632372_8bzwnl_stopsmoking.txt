Had the first craving in a very long time!

Spring finally arrived in my super cold city. I was having a drink with 3 friends outside after a long day at work and there was a box of cigarettes on the table. It took me a great mental effort not to ask for one. 
I spent quite some time debating with myself whether I could ask at least to light up a cigarette for one of the two friends who smoke. 
The fourth person in the group was the non-smoker friend with whom I co-signed my commitment not to take one more puff ever again. I should have picked a more judgmental one! I was debating in my mind how he would have reacted. Somehow, I thought it would have been cool about it all, but this somehow made the prospect even more humiliating.
In a way, it is sad that after more than 7 months I still have to deal with a craving. Still, I am proud that I resisted it and I really hope Allen Carr is right when he says that are exactly these episodes that make us stronger. 

So guys, hang in there during the warm season! And all my respect for people who have quit and are around smoker often. Fortunately I am not and it is really hard!

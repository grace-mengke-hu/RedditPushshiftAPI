What was your final nudge to quit smoking?

Mine was quite powerful, I happened to go on vacation with my parents (in their seventies) and my children at the seaside. I thought I was doing well with my kids, bathing twice a day for more than half an hour. However my parents were much more active than me: they always went to the beach early in the morning(with my kids), they took many walks, played a lot with a freesby and rackets. I had to throughly read the newspaper to smoke and "relax", it was also better to smoke without walking and I found myself to fit the activities with my smoking schedule (before a long bath I had to waste time smoking with my kids getting nervous). Smoking was an obstacle to fully enjoy my vacation. I already knew that smoking robbed some of my energy and made me a lazy ass, but having less energy than my parents? Unacceptable!
P.S: I have much more energy now, my kids cannot keep up with me and my pedometer confirms!

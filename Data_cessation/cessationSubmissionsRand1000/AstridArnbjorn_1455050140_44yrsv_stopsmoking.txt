Day 7: overcame a huge trigger yesterday (husband smokes and I am trying to quit)

My husband smokes.  He will always smoke and it will be a constant battle for me not to join him.  I really, really wanted to smoke yesterday.  The cravings we constant.  But I managed to resist.  I am proud of myself :O)  The last few times I tried to quit, this was my undoing.

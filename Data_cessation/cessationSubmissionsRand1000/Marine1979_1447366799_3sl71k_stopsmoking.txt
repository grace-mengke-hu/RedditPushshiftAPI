I cant believe I didn't smoke last night

Last night was tough for me after I found out some bad financial news. I have a lot of anxiety don't know if they are cravings still or my thyroid medicine is off as my doctor stated its too high from my blood work and that is where my anxiety is coming from. I hope I start feeling better soon.

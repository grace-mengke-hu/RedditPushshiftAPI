500 days plus a week.

I was just checking in and saw where I was. Wow. It's been so long since I've even thought about it, I forgot I had a milestone.

I don't know what to say about it except that if I quit, you can too. I'm no smarter, nor am I more strong or weak willed than any of you. I didn't have any better reasons for quitting than anybody and I wasn't any more or less addicted. I'm just a regular guy and I quit. You can too. I believe in all if you.

I should also say how grateful I am to this sub. I spent a lot of time on here reading stories of successes and redoubled efforts after missteps. I took advice, gave and received encouragement and I am so very thankful for everything.

Push through, you guys. It's great on the other side.

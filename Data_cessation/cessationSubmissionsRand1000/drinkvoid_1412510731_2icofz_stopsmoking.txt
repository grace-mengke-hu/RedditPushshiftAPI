quitting & getting in shape work SO well together

So this week i started to map my progress with the help of a gamification running tool. Seeing the progress of just 6 days is pretty amazing.

* Wedneday: [1.3km total ; 05:49min/km](http://www.mapmyrun.com/workout/751401391)
* Friday: [2.5km total ; 06:20min/km](http://www.mapmyrun.com/workout/753723463)
* Sunday: [3,75km total ; ~ 06:15min/km (botched unpausing after flexing on this one)](http://www.mapmyrun.com/workout/755615539)

So to everyone struggling with recognizing the benefits of quitting: **start mapping your progression** - gamification is *so so so* beneficial. it is so much easier to find the motivation to get up when you instantly see how much you improved. I actually crave the day after tomorrow already, because it means i can go running again!

oh and just a little reminder: i have done my research for the vlog i promised for tomorrow! another 24 hours or so and I should be done with recording (and editing. if you want to call what I do editing. i feel like that would be an insult to real editors. haha)

so stay strong people! and map your progress! be it sports or health benefits (there are great stopping apps that take care of tracking for you) or how your skin looks or how long you last in bed or whatever. it is all trackable. and it feels so good experiencing the progress both in reality and in numbers! Carry on everybody!

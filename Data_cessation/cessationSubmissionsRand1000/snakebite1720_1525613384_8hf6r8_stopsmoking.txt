Third attempt in quitting. On day 3. Using NRT

Just wanted to drop a note and ask one important question. 

Am on my third attempt to quit in last 3 months. Maximum I went was 14 days smoke free and all of a sudden am back smoking. 

Have been a smoker for around 12 years with Average 10 ciggrates a day. So my questions are :

1- How soon should I expect to get better in terms of health stamina lungs etc etc. Am gyming for last 1.5 years. Cardio and all. And been a athlete for almost all my life. 

2- am using nicotine patches this time. Stage 2 ones. Is it fine using them. I am using them because I don't wanna go back smoking again and will do anything for it. 

My goal is simple. To build muscles and be a dad soon :)  and if I remain a smoker I won't get the desired results. 

Suggestions?? 

Thanks for reading.

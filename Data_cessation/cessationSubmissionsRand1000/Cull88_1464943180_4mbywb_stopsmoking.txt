Fell off the horse

the last month has been tough, since the weather changed I've been thinking about smoking near enough all day, everyday. I felt it was only a matter of time when I was going to have one, but still, I stayed strong... Until last Sunday, it was a beautiful Bank Holiday weekend, and I got very drunk (don't blame the booze, i've been drinking the last 4 months and I've been fine) had 1... 2... 3... 10. I didn't smoke the next day and took it as a blip. Since Tuesday, I have smoked everyday, only like 3-4 a day, but I feel firmly back in it's grip. Tomorrow is a new day, going to finish this pack and get straight back on, if I smoke any longer than this pack, I know i'll be fucked!

I feel like i've let this community down, I really, REALLY did think I was over smoking, but it will just always be there, regardless of what people say, there will always be that little monster, trying to trick you. I know it gets eaiser to say no, the longer you don't smoke, but you have to be on guard. Possibly forever? Most likely.

If anyone is thinking of starting again, don't.

but 134 days is not bad! it's the longest i've ever gone. 6 months is my next target.

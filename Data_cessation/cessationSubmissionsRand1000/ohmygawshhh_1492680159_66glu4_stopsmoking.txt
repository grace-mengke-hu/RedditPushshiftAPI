I'm eating everything, its only been 5 hours.

I got myself a badge though. Generally I replace most meals with a cigarette or two. Breakfast, 2 cigarettes and a strong coffee. 
Lunch - 2 cigarettes and a piece of chocolate 
Dinner - something thats bad for me. 
I am going to listen to the stop smoking subliminal messaging on youtube tonight because thats worked for me before. I know I can do this and I really want to but heavens I hope that I see great results in my skin and bank balance. I already am seeing bank balance results from literally just not buying the pack of ciggs that I would have brought when I ran out today! I'm vaping too and will probably wear a patch tomorrow. 

Omg this is much harder than quitting alcohol. Thank god I'm still allowing myself coffee! :) Thanks for reading if you are, I'm mostly ranting to stop myself thinking about filthy cigarettes. 

Yew. Lets be non smokers and not smell like shit! I'm going to treat myself to a new perfume after 12 days.

If anyone has any advice I'd love it! :)

3 weeks!

Today I was alone with my brother in law's half smoked cigarette. It was just sitting on my deck. Mocking me. In past quits I would have smoked that thing in a second. Nobody around to see me. It's not even a whole cigarette. It's not like I bought a pack or anything. 

NOT TODAY! Today I made it 3 whole weeks without smoking a cigarette. 

I am using NRT and I've begun to step it down. Tomorrow I move to 2mg lozenges and 6mg ejuice in my vaporizer. I already ordered my 3mg juice so it shouldn't be long before we step it down again. Maybe another 3 weeks. 

I'm super proud of myself and I think this is a turning point. Didn't want to give up my 21 days for one nasty half smoked cigarette. That's a big step for me. :D

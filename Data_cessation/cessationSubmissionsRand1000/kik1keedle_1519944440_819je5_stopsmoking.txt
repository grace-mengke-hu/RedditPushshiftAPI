I read an Allen Carr book.

And while I am mostly attributing my nearly 24 hour quit to having my ass kicked by Just Dance last night, I find myself sitting here thinking about "the little monster" writhing in pain as he is starved to death. For some reason, the little monster totally looks like one of those weird shriveled up things in Ursula's cave in The Little Mermaid.

Posting this instead of smoking. Just go with it, please. Lol it's helping the craving. As is the cinnamon gum...

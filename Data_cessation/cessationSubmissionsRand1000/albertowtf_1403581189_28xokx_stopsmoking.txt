I cant sleep

its 5.30am here. i ran out of smokes sunday and decided it was a good time to quit after about 12 years. cravings have been bad so far. small in duratiom but very strong in intensity. right now im heads up in bed eyes wide opened. not sure a cigarrete would calm me right now, but i associate it with the cravings some how. argggggg

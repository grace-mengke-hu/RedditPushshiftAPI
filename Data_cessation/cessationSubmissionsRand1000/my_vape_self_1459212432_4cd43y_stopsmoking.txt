Two Years.

So, there were times that I thought I would die a smoker.  I didn't see a way to quit.  Pack a day for over twenty years.

Then I found a way.  And I think I have made it stick.  I got my head straight.  I got my mental game: 

* I don't miss tapping my pockets every time I stand to know that my smokes are there.

* I don't miss planning my day around when I can smoke.

* I don't miss spending $80 to 100 *a week* for the isolation of a smoker.

* I don't miss smoking.  I don't miss the crave-release roller-coaster.  

I didn't give up anything.  
##I broke free.

You can too.

I really like [this book](http://www.whyquit.com/ffn)  I found it after I quit, but it summed up the good stuff.  If you are using nicotine quit, just read past those bits.

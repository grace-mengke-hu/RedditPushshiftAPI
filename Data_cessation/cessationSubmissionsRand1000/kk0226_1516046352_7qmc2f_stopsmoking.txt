Knowing You Can't Have Even One

I was at a company party this weekend and I wanted to smoke so badly.  My mind kept saying you can have just one and then just don't have one again, I knew better.  I kept telling myself no do not do it. 
I was talking to a nonsmoker coworker about how bad I wanted one... and he said to me, Oh I know... I haven't had one in 5 and a half years and I want one right now too.   We both agreed though that having even just that one was not worth it, because we both know it would not just be one.

Stay strong eveyone and remember it is never just one.  Hold yourselves to the highest standards and take extreme ownership of your quit  You can do this!

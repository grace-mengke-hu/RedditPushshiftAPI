Having a REALLY rough time today.

In the last week and a half this has been the roughest day so far. Things are slow at work and that's usually when I'd spend more time outside. My whole head is tingling. I tried telling myself "just make it through today" but that quickly turned into "then what? To go through the same discomfort tomorrow?" One thing I know for certain, if I broke down and bummed one - or even took a single drag - I know I'd feel better in the moment, then immediately guilty. I'd feel even stupider in the morning, knowing I'd "undone everything" and having to start over.

I'm trying to enjoy it like the *easy way*. I'm telling myself this is how nicotine works - that it slowly drags its way out of your system, kicking and screaming the whole way - but I guess I just need to hear it from someone else that it gets easier.

It was a rough day but I made it through w/o smoking and now that the worse is over? It's really awesome!

My sleeping has been shit since I quit.  I'm rolling w/it but today was my Dad's birthday and we had a falling out so it was a really sad day and course being sad/angry/hungry/tired are all buttons to relieve the stress and my brains still whispering "just one" .

I came here and asked for support and a couple of kind folks helped me out just by expressing care.  

Whew.  It would of been SO MUCH WORSE if I'd smoked.  I'm so grateful this sub is here.  Many thanks!

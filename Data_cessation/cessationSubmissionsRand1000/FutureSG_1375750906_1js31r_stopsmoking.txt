I'm ready. I'm done.

I read Allen Carr's Easyway again. I'm done. I failed quitting a few days ago. Read the book again and I've had my last one. Even though I had quit for only 5 days (cold turkey) I realize I LIKED being a non smoker. To all you boys and girls, men and women out there: we are so much better off! We can never go back to being "social" smokers or less addicted than we were. It's over and thank god! we are going to return to the state of peace all natural humans have before we got addicted. You all have been a big help.

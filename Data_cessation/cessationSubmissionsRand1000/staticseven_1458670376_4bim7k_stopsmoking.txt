Future Smokes

So I'm two weeks in and today is the first day where I've not had a single craving. Have been out, smelled people smoking, and only now have I realised that it didn't really bother me or kick off any cravings.
But it also sparked some thoughts. I've got a few holidays planned this year with friends, and when I'm on holiday I ALWAYS smoke. I love it. Sun, heat, wine, laughs, cigs. They all fit together perfectly. But I also know that if I smoke on holiday the chances of me stopping when I get back home are pretty low. All the daily stuff doesn't feel like a sacrifice or an imposition. I feel better for not smoking, and I'm glad I've managed two weeks without. But going without smokes on holiday really does feel like I'm missing out.
I'm not posting this in an attempt to sanction me smoking when I go away. And I know only two weeks into quitting is probably going to be very different from 3 months down the line. But this is honestly the first big test where it feels like its not about health, and it's not about saving money, or about being more attractive, or just being happier. This is something that feels like I'm really denying myself, and this might be the first time I've really felt that with quitting.

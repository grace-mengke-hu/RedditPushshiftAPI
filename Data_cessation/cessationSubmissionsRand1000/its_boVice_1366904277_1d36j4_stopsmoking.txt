3 days smoke free but the cravings are getting stronger.

Has this happened to anyone else? The first 3 days were pretty uneventful, considering I was a pack a day smoker for about 6 years. But today, all I can think about is just having a couple of drags. 

What are your tricks to hinder or manage cravings and/or moments of weakness?

Little over a month and now i'm lethargic?

First month was great. Excited, working out, happy as can be. Now, lethargic, don't want to do anything, no desires (sex, going out, excitement etc) basically just want to stare at the ceiling fan. I'm so over smoking that it isn't even a thought to go back which is great. But just wondering if anyone else felt awful so late into it?

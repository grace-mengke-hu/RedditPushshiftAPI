I hate seeing my old badge number

Man. If I had stuck with it, I'd be over a year. My badge currently says 470 days. I didn't make it anywhere near that, but was too discouraged to come reset again after I failed again after a day last time. 

But I'm going for it again. I have officially made it a week, and I have requested my new badge. This is it this time. It has to be. My health is not great. It's not awful, mind you. I can still recover and get back on track. But I've smoked for 12 years. I have to be done. This sub helped me last time and I am going to focus more on it than I did last time. 


Edit: added more info.

Nicotine withdrawal seems to be triggering suicidal ideation

Essentially what it says in the title. This is the aspect of quitting which I am struggling most deeply with. 

I was in a very good emotional state when I made the decision to quit, but since then I feel almost as though I've regressed to a teenaged state. I am very easily, and very deeply, upset (distressed is maybe a more accurate term), and my impulse control is poor. 

Quite concerned that I might seriously hurt myself, but I don't want to use that as an excuse to keep smoking; I do believe in quitting.

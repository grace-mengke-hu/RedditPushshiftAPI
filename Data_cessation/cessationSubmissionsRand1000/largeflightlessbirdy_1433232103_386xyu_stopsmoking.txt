Day 2 again...

So this is my hundred and first attempt to quit smoking but this time feels different somehow. I think I was hit by several reminders at once over the weekend of all the things that smoking is costing me and all the things it could cost me in the years to come. 

So this time I'm doing something different in that I'm not doing anything particularly fancy or trying out any technique other than cold turkey. I figured I spent about £3.50 a day on smoking, so every time I make it to 9pm (the time of my last cigarette) without smoking over the 24 hours previously I chuck £1 in a jar by my bed. If I make it a year then I'll treat myself to something nice. 

Other than that I'm just planning on taking it one day at a time. Rather than focusing on how I'm not going to smoke ever again, every time I get a craving I remind myself that I'm not smoking today. 

Anyway, thanks for listening. I hate coming of nicotine, but goodness knows I need to!

If not for me, I'm going to do this for the baby.

I found out that I'm pregnant with my first child about a week ago. I was hoping to have successfully quit before I got pregnant, but life had other plans.

I called the Minnesota quitline for help because I've realized I can't do this on my own like I thought I could. I'm getting phone counseling sessions and they're going to send me patches to help me quit. We set my quit date for 12/26/14.

I've quit before, but this time seems a lot harder. I want to give my child the best chance possible, and I can't do that by continuing to smoke. My husband is also planning on quitting with me, so it's going to be a tough few days for us. I'm looking forward to being a non-smoker again and having a healthy child.

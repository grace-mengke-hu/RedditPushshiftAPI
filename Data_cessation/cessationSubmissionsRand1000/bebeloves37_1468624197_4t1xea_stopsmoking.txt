Is this a trick??

So today marks 2 weeks of being smoke-free and I'm struggling worse today than I was on day 1....had a fight with my husband and feel like crap. He keeps asking me how I'm doing over and over again and it's driving me nuts! I've asked him to stop and he says ok but acts all hurt. Anyway, I find myself questioning my motivation for quitting. I feel like there were some external motivators (husband being one of them) that contributed to my quit and I'm afraid I don't have enough internal motivation to make this happen in the long term. But all of this deep thinking started today after a fight and I'm wondering is this just a trick or should I start again and quit when I have true internal motivation? Anyone else have thoughts like this? Please help

edit - thank you everyone for the support. I'd not heard of extinction burst before and that really helps explain things. I've quit for 4 years once and for 1.5 years most recently. I hope I haven't made the extinction burst that much worse by quitting so many times. But I haven't smoked yet and don't plan to!

Did I quit or is it cheating?

I quit smoking a while back and quickly realized I could not sustain it (would smoke a pack in about 3 days). 

So I, bought a vaporizer. And I have not bought a pack or smoked a cigarette, in three weeks now. 

I have also reduced my cravings going from smoking about 5-7 cigarettes to about 70-90 puffs of diluted 0.8% nicotine + 0% nicotine vapor. So in my mind, it is a positive step. The plan is to eventually switch to nicotine free and then vapor free.

What do you think? Anyone have any experience quitting this way? Or am I just setting myself up again?

One week went by without even realizing it.

It's been 9 days, 13 hours, and 10 minutes since my last cigarette. I am still using my ecig on the lowest level of nicotine but plan to cut down and eventually stop using it over the course of a few months. I am sick, my mouth and tongue are full of sores and I'm coughing up some pretty nasty shit. But it all reminds me of just how bad cigarettes are for my body and how it really wants to get that gunk out. I'm 19. Parents didn't give a damn about me smoking, but it helped to have just one friend who did. thank you.

I just want... something

I can't tell what it is, even though I know what it is.

Day 1 was terrible. Day 2 was better, but we had a brownie tray... thing. I ate all of it. It's fine. I was in a good mood all day.

Today I woke up, Day 3, and I just... want something. My brain keeps going back to cigarettes once I try all the things and none of it satisfies.

Coffee. Gum. Crackers. Tea. Fruit. More fruit. Granola bar. Water.

Trying to find that thing that makes the brain go ahhhh yeah that's the stuff.

Ive failed here before. An urgent craving is one thing to get through - but a dull, constant craving is different. Nothing seems to work. I forget about it, and it comes back with a feeling of a "thing I never handled."

Maybe it's just me being uncomfortable and Ill just have to BE uncomfortable instead of racing to fix it.

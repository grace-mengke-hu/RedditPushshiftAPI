CBD Oil, anyone?

TLDR: Vaping CBD oil has helped me deal with my anxiety/depression while quitting. Maybe it could help you? 


I just wanted to throw this out there just in case it could help someone else. 

I am an extremely anxious person. I am also incredibly emotional and I used to handle any situation by smoking a cig. Recently my boyfriend talked me into trying CBD oil using a vape. 

Disclaimer: I used to smoke weed maybe 10ish years ago, but then I started getting SUPER paranoid. With this though, it’s a completely different experience. 

I don’t use it frequently, but when I do it’s normally before bed or when my anxiety is getting the best of me. This has been such a game changer. In the future, I plan to take CBD via another means, but for now, the vape gives me a “smoking” feeling when I’m jonesing.

18 hours 30 mins smoke free. Is it normal to be coughing more than when I was smoking?

I’m having a lot of physical and mental symptoms. The one that is bothering me the most is my throat, it feels super scratchy and I keep coughing and wheezing. I didn’t used to cough this much when I was smoking. It almost feels like my body is trying to expel the toxins from my body. Is this a real thing? 

The good part about my throat hurting and all the coughing is that it actually makes smoking the last thing in the world that I want to do. 

I’m also feeling really low energy, and really easily irritated. My neck hurts quite a bit too.

Anyone have any insight or tips on getting through these symptoms? How long can I expect them to last before I start feeling like myself again?

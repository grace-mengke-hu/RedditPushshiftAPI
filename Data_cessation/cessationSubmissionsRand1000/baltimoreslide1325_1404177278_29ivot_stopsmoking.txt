Can't get over the hump. Advice?

I've been on and off quit for the past few months.
I had a really good (for me) quit going back in early April; some truly absurdly stressful stuff happened 8 days in and I relapsed, quit again, relapsed, quit again, etc.  
Now I've been full on smoking again for about a month. Ugh!  
I tried to quit again last week. Threw out my pack in the evening; had a glucose blood test at the doc the next day so knew I couldn't have coffee in the morning anyway; figured I'd get through the night and that morning and just keep going. But no. I totally bought a back immediately after the doc appointment. What the f--- is wrong with me??  
In the past, I've gotten over the 3 day hump by being sick or something. I'm finding it impossible to do otherwise. Does anyone have advice? During previous quit attempts, I could feel the benefits of not smoking by day 4 or 5, and LOVED being a nonsmoker. I just can't seem to GET to day 4 or 5.  
Been a smoker about ten years, 5-7 smokes/day.  
Any advice madly appreciated!

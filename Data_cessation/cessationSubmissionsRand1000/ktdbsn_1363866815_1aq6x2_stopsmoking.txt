Almost at two weeks - having some issues.

As of last Wednesday I've been severely down in the dumps, to the point where my family are trying to encourage me to go to the doctors to get some help. Can quitting cause depression?

It won't phase me though - I'm not going to smoke just because I'm feeling a bit sad.

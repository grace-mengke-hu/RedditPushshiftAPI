Unexpected events on day 4, but proud of myself

Hi guys!

I was on day 4 yesterday and it turned out to be a day with a lot of unexpected events. I woke up feeling this was going to be the hardest day of them all, but I literally had no idea how hard. 

First I heard a friend of my mom's is going to die today (euthanasia). I don't know this friend, but I do worry about my mom. So I called her, talked to her and DIDN'T smoke. Even if I was feeling bad, I just didn't. 

A little while later my sister in law told me she probably has some form of cervical cancer. She's calling the doctor today to make an appointment to see if it's benign or not. This obviously was a shock and stressful. But I didn't smoke. 

In the evening I had to tell my boyfriend about his sister (she wanted me to tell him). Already had two beers in me (testing myself with alcohol while staying at home with as less triggers as possible, see what would happen), when my boyfriend called his sister. We decided to go over to support her. My sister in law smokes, so does her boyfriend and so does my boyfriend. And my sister in law smokes INSIDE her house (my boyfriend does not). This was the first time since quitting when I went to a place where they smoke inside and there's more than one smoker. And I drank alcohol before that, not knowing we would go there. 

I DIDN'T smoke. 

I'm not saying it wasn't hard. I had cravings, definitely. But they passed and I did well. At some point, I didn't even think about smoking anymore. So now I'm kind of proud of myself and even more sure that this time, I'll keep it up.

Today I woke up, and the craving was way less. Today is going to be a good day. 

Just wanted to share.

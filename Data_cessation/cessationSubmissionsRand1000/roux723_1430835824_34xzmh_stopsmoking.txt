Came frighteningly close to caving again =(

Yesterday I remembered a big trigger for myself -- getting home from the airport. After the stress of traveling, the relief of getting home again always makes me want a cigarette. As my plane into New York started its descent, all I could think of was "I need a smoke." So much so that I even decided I would bum one from my boyfriend when I got home because he had slipped up this past week from stress and had bought a pack. When I got home, though, he was out, having smoked the whole pack and then recommitted to quitting. And the thought of walking to the bodega after a long day of travel was too much for me. I ate a bunch of Thai food instead, which I know overall was the much healthier decision. I'm scared though of how close I came to caving in to the craving -- if there had been a single cigarette in the house I would have thrown in the towel, all for a few seconds of pleasure before I felt sick and disgusting for hours. Damn it. I'm glad I didn't smoke, but I'm worried how close I came.

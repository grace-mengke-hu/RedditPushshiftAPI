Finally got my implant!!!

I had my last dental surgery today and got my implant! !!! Now we let it heal and in February I can get a tooth made for it.  I'm so happy this painful journey is coming to an end and so thankful I quit smoking,  otherwise I would be doomed to lose more teeth.

Remember folks, smoking affects more then juat the color of your teeth,  and I wouldn't wish these last 6 months on anyone.

2 weeks - thanks guys!

I haven't been on here for about a week, but I wanted to thank you all for being so supportive and informative!

I'm now 15 days smoke free and I feel I've come through the hardest parts - having hallucinated and lost sleep/my temper, I'm finally feeling like a normal person again because I am a non-smoker. I can drink without smoking, eat large meals without smoking, drive to work without smoking and deal with stressful days at work without smoking.

I am a non-smoker, and you guys all helped me :).

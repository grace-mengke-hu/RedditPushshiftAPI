Cravings are weird

I'm on day 7 & at this point nicotine is out of my system.  Why are my cravings worse now than when I first quit?  The first 3-4 days were a breeze compared to yesterday.  Hope today is better...  I am a nonsmoker, I won't light up.  Don't have anything to light up anyways and plan to keep it that way. :-)

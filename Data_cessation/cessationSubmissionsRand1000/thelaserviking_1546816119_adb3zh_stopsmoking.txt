Round two, let’s do it.

Around this time a year ago, I made the decision to quit. I lasted three months until work and school stress mixed with cravings overpowered me and I fell back into the habit. 

A few months ago I began seeing someone. She’s a non-smoker but was aware of my habit. I opted to not smoke around her as it bothered her, which in a way help me cut down as I began to spend days with her at a time. My habit, however, limped along when I was at work or alone at home, and every time I lit up I’d feel a small sense of guilt. 

A week ago I decided to give it up after walking out of a 7/11 with a fresh pack. So I worked a rapid cut down through Allen Carr’s method and began listening to podcasts as I drove and slept. The first day Iimited to four a day, then three, etc.  The night before last, I had my last cigarette ever. I felt empowered as I put it out. I felt in control for once. 

I’m not a smoker. That feels so good to say.

Finishing day 13 and hacking my lungs out.

So I’m heading to bed after being smoke free for 12 days, 22 hours, and 38 minutes.  
I havnt really been coughing or anything until literally 5 minutes ago.  I’m hacking my head off.  Does anyone else have coughing happening?  When did it start for you?  When did it end?
I know it’s the crap in my lungs trying to clean out but it’s annoying.

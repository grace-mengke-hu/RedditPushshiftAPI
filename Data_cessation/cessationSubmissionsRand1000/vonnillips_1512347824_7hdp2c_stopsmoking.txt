Those of you who took a few tries at quiting: don't those pangs of quitting kinda give you a buzz in a way?

This is my third stab at kicking it, but enduring and defeating those pangs kind of bring on a high of their own. Idk if I'm alone there, but I feel pretty fucking good when I've shut down a pang.

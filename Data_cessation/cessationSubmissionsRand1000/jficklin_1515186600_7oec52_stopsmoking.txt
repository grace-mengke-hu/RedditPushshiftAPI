It's been a while since I've been here...

Back at it again. Sad to see how if I had kept up with it I would be at 251 days today. Reset the badge. I'm approaching Day 5.

I'm getting older and I seriously don't feel well. I hope this time I can keep it up. 

I'll be hanging around here with you good people for a while. Nice to be back.

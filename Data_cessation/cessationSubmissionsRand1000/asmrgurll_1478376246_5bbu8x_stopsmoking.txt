Starting to Try and Quit

Right now as I am writing this Im sitting at the park. Not even quite one day that I have stopped smoking. I haven't had a smoke for close to 14 hours so far. I have tried to quit before, but at around midnight last night, I decided to try my hardest to try and make this a permanent thing. 

It is so easy to just give in and make out as though only one won't hurt anything or think oh well I tried. Maybe next time. But now I really want to focus on improving my life. And not just by changing some things or make small changes. No I want to create an entirely new me, have a dramatic transformation and that includes giving up smoking. 

I went for a walk nearby to get coffee and some gum. I figured if I felt like smoking I could just chew on some gum to hopefully keep me distracted long enough for a craving to pass. Being outside at the park near nature feels good. Normally I'm sitting on my balcony figuring out, planning and stressing out a bit about my life. 

I'm worried that I'll be tempted to just give in to having a smoke when I get home. I might try to focus on decluttering and cleaning up my place and or car. Possible work out a bit in my apartment gym. 

Any advice or thoughts on what I could do to try and keep my mind off of this and to make becoming a non-smoker a permeant lifestyle change would be appreciated.

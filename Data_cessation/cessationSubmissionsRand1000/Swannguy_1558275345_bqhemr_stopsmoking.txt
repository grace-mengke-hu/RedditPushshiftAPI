1 Day Down!

Managed to make it through my first day :). Found it hard to be out in public though. I could smell cigarette smoke from people smoking half a block away &amp; it smelt awesome! Spent the day at home eating and watching tv. 

Iâ€™m using  a nicorette puffer. Anyone had experience with these? I find it hard to tell when the cartridge is empty.

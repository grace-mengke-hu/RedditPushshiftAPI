Holy Sh*t... 32 days?

Just realized today was 32 days!! I literally have hated every single second of not smoking. I whine about it constantly. I think about it all the time. The urge to smoke is only marginally better than it was the first day I quit. I miss it pretty terribly. I'm still not sure why I'm not smoking but I'm just not doing it. I've gone through some pretty stressful, life changing shit recently and didn't smoke. It's literally day by day for me. Sometimes second by second. I'm still waiting for the moment where I feel awesome about quitting and I'm still feeling 'meh' about it. 
I read a lot of these posts and people are ecstatic and feel wonderful after 30 days. I wanna be that person!
Anyways, here's to 32 days. I'm gonna keep truckin and continue hoping for that 'A-HA!' moment!

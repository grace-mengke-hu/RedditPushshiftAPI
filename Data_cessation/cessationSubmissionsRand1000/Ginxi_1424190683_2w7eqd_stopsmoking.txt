Anxiety and insomnia

I'm six weeks in now. Insomnia kicked in around the two week mark. No problem getting to sleep but staying asleep is a real problem almost every night. I am also suffering some tightness of breath on occasions. It feels like it might be stress but the weird thing is I don't feel stressed. May not even be quit related. Anyone else had similar problems?

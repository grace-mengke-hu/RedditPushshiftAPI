Post your smoking dream here

 Here is mine:

We(family) were driving our selfs toward some place. I took the lighter and light up the cigarette. Took a puff. At that moment I realized: "Oh no! I took a puff. I'm a smoker now". I threw the rest of cigarette. The rest of the drive I was so guilty and sad. Tomorrow I woke up and It was just another smoking dream. But, the day was really dumb. I felt weird.

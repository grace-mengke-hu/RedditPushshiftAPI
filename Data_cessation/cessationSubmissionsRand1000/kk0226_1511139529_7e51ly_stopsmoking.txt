2 Weeks Down ... First Mile Ran Nonstop

As of today I have not smoked in 2 weeks!  I have been a “runner” for a year and a half now. I would run... then walk... then run...  I had basically worked my way to a point where I couldn’t get my time any better or my running stretches any longer. 
I had not ran for 14 days as I started a new workout program 2 weeks ago.  Tonight I went for a 2 mile run I took 2 minutes off my time and ran my first ever full mile without stopping or slowing down.  Such an AMAZING feeling.  
I was asked after my run how I felt... I said good minus the fact I want to smoke. You see... I used to reward my workouts with a cigarettes after I finished them, I have had to fight that routine every day for 14 days.  
I am so happy that I made the decision to run and get an extra workout in today as it was an awesome insight into what I can do and what I could do if I keep pushing myself.

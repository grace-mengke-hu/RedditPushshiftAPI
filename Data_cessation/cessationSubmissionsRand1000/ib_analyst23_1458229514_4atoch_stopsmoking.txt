Why Do I Lack So Much Self Control?

I'm 23 and have tried and failed to quit many times. Within the last four weeks I've tried and failed at least three times. I read the first 20 or so pages of Allen Carr's book yesterday, then light up and eventually threw the rest of the pack out with the "I don't need this anymore, this doesn't do anything for me and I'm above this" attitude. I am now at work feeling miserable yet again and am steps away from going down to the convenience store and getting a pack.

I don't know why I lack so much self control. I was so sure I didn't need this anymore last night and it hasn't even been 10 hours and I want to smoke again so bad. My wife doesn't believe me anymore when I say I'm trying to quit. I don't even crave on weekends as much, just during the week. It's my damn job that does it. I usually work 15 hours a day sitting in front of a computer in an office and the smoke breaks were the best part of my day.

A huge part of me wants to quit. Another huge part of me (possibly the bigger part) doesn't want to quit, it doesn't want to get through the urges, it wants to give up and it wants to delay the quitting. It recognizes the urges don't last that long but it doesn't want to get through them. When this part of me wins and I smoke, the other half says, "this is shitty, you don't get anything from this."

I'm at work as a type this and I'm fucking torn and I don't know what to do.

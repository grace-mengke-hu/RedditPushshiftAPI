I smoked my last cigarette

Last night I smoked my last cigarette.  I've been smoking a pack a day for 15+ years.  This morning is great.  I'm having a lovely dark roast in bed.  I'm not shivering outside smoking, which is nice.  For some reason there are tears running down my face.  I'm not really alarmed though since I'm pretty prone to tears and they can be triggered by beautiful music or art as well as anger or sadness. I really don't know why I'm crying though.  I think it's because it's so beautiful to realize that I have control. 

I cannot thank r/stopsmoking enough.  You have all been such an inspiration.

Off to watch this demon die.....

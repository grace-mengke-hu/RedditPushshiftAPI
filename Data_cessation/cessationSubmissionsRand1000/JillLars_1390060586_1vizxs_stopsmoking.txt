Quitting tomorrow...attempt number ?

I am planning to quit smoking tomorrow.  Planning to use NRT as it worked well for me in my longest previous quit attempt- just shy of a year.  I've lost count of the number of times that I've tried to quit- but we have to keep trying right?  Hopefully this one will stick.  A couple of co-workers are quitting tomorrow as well.  I'm coming up with a fitness plan today so that I can get back to the gym and hopefully lose some weight too.  Exercising tends to work well to keep my mind of the cigs.  I want to be healthy, I want to set a good example for my kids, I need to do this.

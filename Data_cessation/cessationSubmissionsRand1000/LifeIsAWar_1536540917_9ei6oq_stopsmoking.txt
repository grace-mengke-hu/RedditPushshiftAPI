At my wits end. Have fixed almost all other aspects of my life and still cannot quit smoking

Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I am in desperate need of help. In the last month I have made monumental changes in my life for the better. All of the bad habits I had I have removed: stopped drinking coffee, on no-fap, gym 4 times a week, sticking to a calorie deficit, sleeping before 11pm. I have also worked on my mental health and everything seems to be going up. These other habits I could give up easily but I cannot for the life of me quit cigarettes. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have quit before using Allen Carr for 4 months before I made this mistake of having that one odd cigarette at a party. Even now I dont smoke much, like 5-10 a day but this time, even though I have read the book 15 times or more in the last 3 months and I have all the points pretty much memorized, I cannot quit for even 1 day. If someone has had the same struggle with quitting using Allen Carr the second time around, please share your story. I could use all the help I can get right now.

Thanks in advance

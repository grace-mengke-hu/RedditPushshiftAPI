I can taste...FLAVORS!

Haha sorry for the silly title, but I am excited! According to my quit smoking app I have nearly fully regained my sense of taste. I made myself some fried rice with onions, celery, garlic, red pepper, and a bit of korma sauce and OMG it tastes so good. Maybe this is just psychological but damn I don't care! This is great motivation for me to never smoke again! I'll just go back to inhaling this rice now...


Cheers :)

I'm quite concerned about what I am doing

Hey guys, I basically have spent the last two years on and off quitting. I quit about 4-5 months ago and haven't looked back. Cravings went away completely, was literally no longer a smoker. I can actually hang out with people smoking when out in bars and feel no desire to have one. 

The last week my SO has been using medicinal marijuana with tobacco following surgery and I have been having some too. Last night I was out and I was dying for a cigarette. I ended up having a drag and then giving it back. Are joints making me a smoker again?

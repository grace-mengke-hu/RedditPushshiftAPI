It took a trip to the hospital, but I think I am there.

Long story short, i was admitted to the hospital with UGI bleeding.  After 3 days of not smoking in the hospital, and the absolute terror of actually being in ICU, I decided it was the perfect time.  I'm now on day six of no cigs, but I've had a nagging head ache for the past 3 days.  Is this a normal side effect?  I've also not been able to have caffeine until today, which meant no coffee :-/.  Could that also be a factor?

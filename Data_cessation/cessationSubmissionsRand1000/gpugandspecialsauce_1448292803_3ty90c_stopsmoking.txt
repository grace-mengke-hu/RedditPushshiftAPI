Goofy

I'm staying in a hotel right now, and when we got on the elevator last night, I mentioned to my husband that if the elevator got stuck (I'm a serious pessimist), at least our only concern would be getting out, not how long we'd be having a nic fit before we got out. 

I seriously always thought that when I'd get on an elevator. 

Or when I went anywhere that smoking wasn't appropriate or allowed - how am I going to get through this?

The freedom is nice!

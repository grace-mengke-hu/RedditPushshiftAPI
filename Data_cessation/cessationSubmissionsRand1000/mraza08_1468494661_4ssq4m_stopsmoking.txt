First 24 Hours

Ok I joined this community to motivate me, it has been my first 16 hours without a  cig after being a smoker for last 15 years....I am quitting cold turkey, I will use gym and other activities to get me through it.....To be honest It's really hard, I already tried to go downstairs and buy pack of Marlboro but than pushed myself back :/....trying my best.....Please tell me how do you feel after quiting smoking? I want to know the good things.....thanks

24 Hours

I just passed the 24 hour mark.  I made it a few days cold turkey, and gave in to my anxiety.  I'm using lozenges now and they are helping so much.  When I woke up today, I immediately reached over to grab a cig.  Then, reached for one while having coffee.  Muscle memory?  Addiction?  I dunno, but I had to wait to use a lozenge until after drinking coffee, going to the dentist, and getting an injection at Dr.  I really, really wanted one, but popped a lozenge instead.  Hard, but not impossible.  And cig smoke already smells awful to me.  Fucking roller coaster of quitting.  Stay strong everyone!

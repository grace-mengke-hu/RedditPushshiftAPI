And a conversation with a friend helped me realize another lie about smoking

My best friend and I were talking. She has been really involved with Zumba and losing weight. I am doing the same. She said she couldn't possibly stop smoking because of the weight gain. It dawned on me in that moment that she and I didn't lose weight or maintain our weight while smoking, we gained all of our weight while active smokers. And now, due to being able to be more active, I'm now losing weight. 

When I first quit a little over a month ago, I did gain about 6 lbs. However, as of today, I've lost 5 of them. 

In the past, when wanting to lose weight, the idea of not smoking scared the living bejezus out of me because I was so scared of weight gain. Why wasn't I as concerned about weight gain and being too out of breath WHILE smoking? Sigh.

She didn't really know how to answer so we changed the subject. She'll quit when ready. But maybe I gave her something to think about. :D

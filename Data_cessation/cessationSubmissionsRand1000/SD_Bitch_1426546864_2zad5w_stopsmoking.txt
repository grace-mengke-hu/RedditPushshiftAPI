Had a silly positive experience today

I had surgery on my hand recently, and I've been having to go to occupational therapy for it. My regular therapist is on vacation, so there was a new therapist today. As we were going through the exercises, she commented that she liked my perfume, because I smelled good.

Well, I don't wear perfume; I've been using an ecig to quit, and that's what she was smelling! It was so nice to be complimented on the way I smelled....after almost 20 years of smoking, that's a first for me.

I know it's silly, but it was very encouraging for me. Hope everyone is doing well today!

An effective way to use patches.

First an aside: I'm 3 days in this time. I've been smoking for about a month, after 3-4 years of not smoking. I restarted and smoked with a vengeance. I'm quitting with a little help from Carr, whom I re-read.

On to my modified patch method:

When I quit three years ago I had been smoking for two decades. I smoked non filters, and roll your own. I really pulled on these things.  After reading Carr, I was ready to go, but at the time I was in a high stress situation, and didn't want the added anxiety and restlessness.  The  pharmacist explained that I had to buy the highest dose patch and use that daily for a month, then buy the medium dose and use for a month, and then the lowest and use it for a month.

Since I didn't want to be a patch addict, and just wanted to lower the discomfort of the initial days, I asked for the medium dose, and instead of putting it on first thing in the morning, I put it on close to mid-day, removed it at night, and followed this pattern for four days.

On the fifth day, having gone through the initial days, with a lower level of nicotine, and without the physical routines, I took the patch and put it in my wallet. If during the day I felt a terrible urge, I could put on the patch, but not smoke. This had a sort of psychological crutch effect.

I never used that patch. After a month I threw it away (all dog-eared). and kept being smoke free for the next three years, until I fell again. 

This time is for good.

Remember, one puff is all it takes to get caught again.

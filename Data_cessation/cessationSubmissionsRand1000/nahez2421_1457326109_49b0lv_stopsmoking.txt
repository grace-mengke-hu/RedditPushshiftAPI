193 days since I quit smoking.

It has been 193 days since I last smoked. It had been really hard to quit but it was done. Since the past 20 days I have been having a really big urge to smoke and it has been really tough.

Anyone knows why and how to tackle this situation. I dont want to go back to smoking and being miserable all over again.

Vacation

Whenever I go on vacation, or take a couple days away, I always notice how smokers are either tethered to looking for a place to smoke or they are smoking. As a smoker, I wasted so much time on vacation looking for where to smoke and smoking. It's so nice to be able to go places now and to simply just go to places. I'm not constantly looking for an out of the way spot to smoke, I'm not looking for an excuse to get away and smoke, I'm not missing out on stuff because of an addiction. It's awesome.

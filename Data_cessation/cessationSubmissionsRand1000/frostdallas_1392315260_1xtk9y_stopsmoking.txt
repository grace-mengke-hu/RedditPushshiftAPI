Officially done.

As a vocalist, every show I've played in the last few years haven't been fun. I dreaded every single appearanceâ€¦ knowing I'd be winded by the third song, invariably worn out from jumping around and not having the endurance I need to put on a good show. I'd burn through half a pack before my set because of nerves and immediately spark up as soon as I'm off stage, still sweating and wheezing from the workout. No amount of cardio or training would remove the damage from my pack-a-day habit.

I'd get so nervous from the expectations of not having enough breath to perform, my throat would seize up. It's a deadly cycle and I've refused more shows than I can count out of the fear that smoking brought into my life.

Well, I'm done. That's it. After four years I'm sick of it. Athletes don't smoke when they train for the Olympics, so why the fuck should I? My drive to become the best I can is my strength, and my friends, family, and all of you in this great sub are my straps that keep me held up.

The headaches, coughs and fogged brain are here, but they'll be gone soon enough. If you all can do it, so can I.

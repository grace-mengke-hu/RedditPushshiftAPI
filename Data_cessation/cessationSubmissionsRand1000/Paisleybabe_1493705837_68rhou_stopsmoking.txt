afraid to celebrate and think about how far ive come

I feel like I'm doing this to prove something to myself  besides all the other reasons i decided to quit and in the past I feel like when I've felt victorious i ended up slipping back to it. No congrats or annything please, I'm afraid that ill go back to it but I'm just wondering if anyone else has felt this way?

Day 3 Check In

Hello fam. Just wanted to stop by and check in here. Today has been rough but I've been here before. The shitty thing is I'm also going through a knee injury at the moment, so I can't just run off the cravings. Looking forward to getting back to the gym though. I need some damn endorphins.  

Overall I feel good. I'm getting married in 8 months and this has been motivating. Looking forward to smelling good and looking good on my wedding day. Keep it up gang. We've got this. Check back in soon.

Trouble sleeping after NRT?

So Iâ€™m like 4 days nicotine free after using the patch for a little less than 5 weeks. The patch helped me a lot and I think because it was on 24/7 it may have affected my sleep cycle. I have had the hardest time staying asleep since I stopped using the patch :( 

Anyone else going through this or have any tips for a very sleepy nonsmoker like me?

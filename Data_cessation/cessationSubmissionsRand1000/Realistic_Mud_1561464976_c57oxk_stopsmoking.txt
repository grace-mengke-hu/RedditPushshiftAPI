day 170 ish

Its not that hard for me to not smoke. Most days I dont even think about it. It gets easier boys. When I first quit I was still thinking about smoking. Now I hardly think about it. And when I do think about it its how much of a pain in the ass it was for me to get up every 50- 60 minutes to smoke and stop whatever I was doing. Cheers

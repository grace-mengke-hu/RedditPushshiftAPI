its been over two years.

Everyday I thank God.  It's been over two years and sometimes I still get the urge.  I allow people to smoke in my presence and that is when I know I am a non smoker.  Good luck all.  Hang in there.  The last time I stopped for 7 years; but, this time I am a non smoker.  :)

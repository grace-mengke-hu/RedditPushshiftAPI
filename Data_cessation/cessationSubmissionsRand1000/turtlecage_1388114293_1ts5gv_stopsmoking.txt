My thoughts on reaching 4 months, and a slip-up story

Today is day 123, what a whimsical number! 

I'm so happy and aI feel so free to be a nonsmoker. 

The other night I inhaled tobacco for the first time since August. I was at a party, and to be honest, I thought someone handed me a joint. It was in fact a rolled cigarette. 

It hurt my lungs terribly and within an hour I had chest pain. My mouth tasted awful and it helped me to remember why I quit. I would never intentionally smoke tobacco but I'm sort of glad I did by accident. Just so I could be reminded of how much I don't miss it. 

Today is a rough day. I found out me and my family are getting evicted from our house. We have 10 days to move all our stuff and we need to find a place. 

A few months ago I would be chain smoking right now. But instead I'm thinking calmly and rationally. 
Quitting smoking has helped to change my entire mindset. I'm so happy. 

Happy 4 months <3

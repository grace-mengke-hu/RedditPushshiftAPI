Stop. Start. Stop. Start.

Hey all- posted here last week about me slipping off the wagon after over 100 days. I spoke about feeling really shitty for screwing up my quit, and everyone here offered amazing support for getting me back up on my feet. I went that day without a smoke, and felt really proud of myself. As much as it pained me, I opened the smoke free app and reset the clock (I had been avoiding doing this). One would think that after being supported by everyone and encouraged to keep moving forward that I would've changed my behavior. Well, 24 hours after I had gone without a smoke, I made the greatly informed decision to give into my cravings and have a smoke. For the past several days, I've been smoking 1-3 cigs, and each time I finish one, I tell myself that those will be the last ones I ever smoke. I reset the clock on smoke free, and then the very next day, I repeat the same process. Rinse and repeat. I failed to throw away the pack that I had purchased initially, which has roughly 11 smokes left, and I seem to just keep gravitating back towards them. I know I need to throw them out. I know that having them around is a big time no-no. Why do I keep doing this to myself? I feel so guilty every time I have one, but there's part of my brain that tells me not to worry about what I'm doing. I'm struggling. This blows. 

tl;dr- Got offered amazing support from everyone here about getting back on the wagon last week, fell off again after 24 hours, struggling to get back on. (I also requested that my current badge be removed, in case it's still up)

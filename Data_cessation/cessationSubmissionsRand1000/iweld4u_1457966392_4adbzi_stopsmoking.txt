What do you think?

I need your input. Been smoke free for about 40 days now. I had smoked for about 35 years. I do very well, better than expected< at home and other places. My problem is at my shop. As soon as I hit the door, the cravings start. I can't shake them. What I am doing starting today is vaping with zero nicotine. This seems to help quite a bit. Question is am I shooting myself in the foot with this? Seems to be the act of smoking is all I need at work, not the nicotine. Any ideas on this would be groovy. Thanks guys.

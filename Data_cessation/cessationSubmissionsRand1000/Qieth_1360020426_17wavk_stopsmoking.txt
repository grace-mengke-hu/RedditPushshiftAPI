Two weeks and I... an worried?

So I made it past 14 days. And I'm doing great. So great that.. I don't know, I feel like I shouldn't celebrate as much as everybody else.

I don't feel like I'm struggling anymore. I hardly think if cigarettes throughout the day, and when I do, it's more of a "Oh remember that time when...?"  Wherever pangs I get are gone in literally seconds. 

And at the same time, I see other people struggling. I get the impression that they are going through hell, when I'm not. Of course, attitude and motivation plays a big factor, but it still worries me. "If something seems too good to be true, it provably is". 

I also worry that I haven't been in any bad situations - I haven't been out drinking offer stuck in a room full of smokers. I don't WANT to, but it will happen eventually. I just hope I can continue as I do now. 

I probably sound crazy. I shouldn't really be complaining. I'm nicotine free, and doing great!

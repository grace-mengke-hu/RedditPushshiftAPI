Affirmations

In a couple of hours, my flair is going to show 48 days. That is one day from seven weeks. And here I am thinking I want a cigarette. Oh boy do I think I want a cigarette.

Seven weeks that I sure as fuck don't want to do over again. All the nicotine is out of my system, so this isn't near the feeling that it was in the first three days. Quitting, this time, was actually pretty easy and it has gotten easier. I have made it a priority to deal with triggers, cravings, and fixating. I have come here and asked for help when I need it. I have done a lot of work and I have had a lot of support. I don't want any of that to be for nothing.

I don't want to take any of this back. I don't want to do any of this all over again. I don't want to be disappointed in myself. I deserve to not smoke. I deserve to have extra energy and to feel joy. I love myself and I respect my recovery. This feeling will pass. One moment at a time here and I will do this. 

In fact, I think I'll watch re-watch The Office. I like watching Jim and Pam fall in love.

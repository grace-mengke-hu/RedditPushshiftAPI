i would like to share a victory

So today was super stressful and busy with 3 classes then a stressful sales job right after. i was running around like a chicken with my head cut off, but looking back on the day, i didn't have one single craving! Its just so weird. old me would have been running out every chance he got to get a smoke break in. Its such a cool feeling! Nicotine controlled my life for so long, and now i'm realizing that things are so much better with out smokes. it feels like i have so much more time in a day. I feel just that much more productive. 

Anywho, i just really felt this was cool and i wanted to share it with you guys. I see so much of the resolutioners here in this sub, that i wanted to let ya'll know that it gets so much better the longer you go. Keep it up everyone!

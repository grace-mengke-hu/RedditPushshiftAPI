I'm tired of being an addict

Tired of making it 20 days, then 8 days, then not even a few hours. Tired of wetting down a pack and throwing it in the trash just to run out and buy another 3 hours later, smoke a couple, get my fix, then toss them again, only to go buy more another 3 hours later. Tired of wasting more money trying to "quit" than I did when I actually smoked full time and didn't care.

This ends tonight, right now. No more smoking. No more compromises with my addict brain. Getting past the physical withdraw is easy. Getting past the mental aspect is much, much harder.

No more.

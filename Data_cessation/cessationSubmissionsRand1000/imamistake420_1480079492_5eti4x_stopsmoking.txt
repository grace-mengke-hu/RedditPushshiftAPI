1000 days...

In the first few days of my quit, I would see people on this sub with numbers in the high triple digits and a few with four digits.  Oh how much I wanted to join their club.

I'm finally here, 1000 days!!!!

I do want to express my love for everyone who has made this sub what it is, a place we can all come to for support when we need to.

If today is your day number one, get a badge, post in this thread and I'll see you 1000 days from now.  Stay strong sisters and brothers.  We can do it!!

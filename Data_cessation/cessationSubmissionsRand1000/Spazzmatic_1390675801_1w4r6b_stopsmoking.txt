Submitted for your entertainment while you work through the cravings.

The Phillip Morris tobacco company has set up a website called www.smokingfeelsgood.com for those thinking of starting to smoke. Its content contains a level of brainwashing and propaganda that would make any North Korean leader proud.

I took a look at their FAQ page and picked up these little ditties:

 “I'm 18 years of age or older, should I give smoking a try? Their answer: "You won't really know the full pleasures of smoking until you've made it through your first 4 or 5 packs. At that point, you'll know if smoking is right for you.”

Yup, 4 or 5 packs oughta do it alrighty!

Here's another...

“What if someone I know disapproves of me smoking?” Their answer: “Explain to them the pleasures of smoking and then offer them a cigarette.”

Oh, that'll convince them,...SURE!

And this one:
"I want to quit smoking. What should I do?"
They answer: "Visit a site like this..." and they provide a link to this site:

Well....you're on your own there, bud!!

Best of all, the whole sight is written so that even a 10-year-old could understand it. Oh, those rascally tobacco company execs!!

Looking for long-lasting mints for oral fixation

I've used nicotine lozenges as a way to suppress my cigarette cravings for quite a while now (I've tried many times before, hence my current "12 days"). The thing is, I think I like how long they last more than the actual nicotine they provide.  It's a good outlet for my oral fixation and they last long enough that I don't feel like I have to continually be popping them in my mouth. Plus, they're expensive and I want to wean myself off of nicotine, not just keep pumping it in my body a different way.  Anyone have any suggestions?

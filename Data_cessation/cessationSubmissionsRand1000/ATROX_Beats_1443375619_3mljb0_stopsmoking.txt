ONE MONTH! :D

A month ago, I don't think I believed I could quit smoking, but now that I have, I feel so fucking good. My chest pains have basically gone away, my anxiety has gotten *a lot* better, and I'm able to walk around for more than 20 minutes without being short of breath (not to mention the fact that I've already saved almost $200).

This sub has been such a great support structure, especially since I don't really have one in my normal day-to-day. In the first few weeks, being able to come here and read everyone else's posts and all the kind responses really gave me the motivation I needed to stay away from cigarettes. Seriously, I want to thank each and every one of you for being so friendly and supportive. I think I speak for everyone when I say it really means a lot. :)

if i can get through THIS...then yeah, bragging rights to my idiot self when i want to smoke in the future

for years, before I was addicted, I honestly just enjoyed smoking.  Now...I've lost a lot of that.  Now I smoke mostly as a coping mechanism for stress.

I don't know if I'll get through the next couple of days without smoking.  Maybe I will, maybe I won't.  But if I DO...then many future stresses will pale in comparison to this week's stress.  I will be able to tell future idiot self - "ha - you think you need one NOW?  You had to deal with with finalizing a deal for selling your house, amidst husband's recently deteriorated depression...and you didn't smoke THEN.  No way you NEED one now if you got through the craving then."

So...now to see what I do tomorrow.  No promises.  But I'm not outright giving up either.  Got through Mon and Tues now....AND I hit double digit 3 hours ago...and we'll all see the shiny 10 tomorrow.  So maybe I can do one more day, one day at a time.

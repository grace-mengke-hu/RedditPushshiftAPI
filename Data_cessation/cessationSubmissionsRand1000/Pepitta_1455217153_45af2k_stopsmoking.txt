Five months! Am I great or am I great :)

Just to thank you for the support! Yet I am still paying attention not to slip. An ex smoker is always an ex smoker. I hope i keep the success. For all of the newjoiners: Whatever you feel, however bad it is...it will pass only if you dont give up. If you have one single puff you are doomed to go through this again. Remember this. It will pass. You will feel like brand new.

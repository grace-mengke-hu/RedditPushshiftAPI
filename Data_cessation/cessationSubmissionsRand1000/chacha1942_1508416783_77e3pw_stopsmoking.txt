Day 4 - breath

I just woke up with no sniffing and clogged sinuses and feel like I can actually take a deep breath.

In writing this what I also notice is that I didn't think about smoking until I realized I needed to write in this journal. 

Today is day 4 and I do not remember when the last time I went 4 days without smoking /something/.

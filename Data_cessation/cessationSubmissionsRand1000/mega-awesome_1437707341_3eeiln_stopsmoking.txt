1 year today!

It's crazy to think 1 year ago I was told I had to quit smoking. And I sat there later shaking and having my last smoke and I just knew I had to stop at that moment.

I'm going to be honest, there have been 3 very drunken incident where I smoked. Each time I woke up the next day angry with myself but I didn't let it deter me. I just went on my day as a non smoker.

I run now. Ran a half marathon and training for he other half now. It feels good.

Thanks to everyone here, but especially, u/drpinkswife and u/my_vape_self for he support when it was the hardest. And for anyone else who was following my story.. YES I have a full set of teeth again :)

(Seriously folks. Smoking can make you lose your teeth. That shit is poison)

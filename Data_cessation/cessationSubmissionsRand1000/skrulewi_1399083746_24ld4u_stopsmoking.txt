Got turned down by girl I was really interested in, just realized that was one of the reasons I quit.

I still have my 31 days, but I just got turned down by a girl I've dated a few times the past few weeks. Wasn't working out for her.

I just realized how big a deal my quitting was to my self-esteem. I don't typically care about superficial bullshit; don't drive a nice car, don't have fancy clothes. I teach music and hang out. But the cigarettes... I knew that she would find it more attractive if I quit. 

Of course I have a million other reasons that I quit, but it's strange how large that one looms. Logic has no effect on proportions.

So I'm not going to smoke for the next hour, on the way to hang out with my friends. One of them might be smoking. I will not ask him for a smoke. That's about as far ahead as I can plan right now.

Thanks for your help, guys.

How I quit this time. Midday not morning.

I have tried to quit, unsuccessfully, many many times. Always the same pattern. Crush up my pack at end of day, resolve to start clean the next morning, wake up the next morning with little resolve, feeling the night's withdrawal, dig out a crushed smoke.

Yesterday I quit midafternoon. It's been going fine, even first thing this morning.

Silly but true. All the best to you great warriors today.

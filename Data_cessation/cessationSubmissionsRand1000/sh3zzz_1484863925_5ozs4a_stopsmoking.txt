3 weeks!

Holy crap. After 18 years of smoking I can't really believe it, but it's here and I'm barely thinking about cigs anymore. I am a non smoker. I have a tiny craving every couple of days but it's completely manageable. I read/watched Allen Carr (watching was much more effective for me) 3 weeks ago and something finally clicked.
For those on week 1 and struggling, it gets easier!

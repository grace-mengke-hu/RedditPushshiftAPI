11 Months Without Smoking

It's been 11 months since I smoked my last cigarette. Yesterday, while I was out with my wife at a casino, I had an urge to smoke. I can't remember the last time I felt like that. The justifications ran through my head, "one cig won't hurt."

I didn't do it, but it was strange having such a strong craving so long after quitting. I'm looking forward to 1 year smoke free.

Nearly 6 years later...

...how the hell did that happen?

I smoked for 24 years. I read Alan Carr four times over ten years and failed every time. I would gag as I was smoking - each cigarette was a. battle between sucking as much nicotine as I could without vomiting. I did not always win. 

You had better believe I was ready to quit. 

The first ten days have the most cravings - if you can get past that you're pretty much home. 

Attitude counts. I made quitting an observational game. Zen like. 
I am not my craving.

The freedom of being free from addiction upped my gratitude. I never needed to walk down yucky alleys or through car parks to ensure I have time for a smoke.

I recently hit a personal milestone...

...and didn't realize until today, almost 2 weeks later.

In my entire smoking life, I had made 2 previous attempts to quit (over 10 years ago). One lasted about 10 weeks, the other about 4 months.

Today I remembered and checked my badge - 82 days.

Yay! Just one personal record left to break now. I'm starting to believe that this is it.

Cheers, /r/stopsmoking.

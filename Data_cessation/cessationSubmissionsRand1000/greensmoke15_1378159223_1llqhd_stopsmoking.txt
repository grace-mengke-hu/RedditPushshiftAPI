Nervous about tomorrow

So tomorrow will be day 4. I have quit before for months.  Lately I have just been smoking at work.  I work at a coffee shop, and I smoke to avoid things/people I don't want to deal with.  I go back tomorrow, for a super long day and then I am off for a few more days.  I have the nicotine out of my system.  I will bring extra carrots and mints tomorrow.  I know the talk track I have with myself when I am at work.  It is like this other voice in my head that I have to argue down.  It says things like, you can just get some across the street and smoke on your breaks.  The people at work expect it, and no one at home will know."  
I know I cant go on smoking a few days a week and quitting the rest, my body just need to get better.

I need help getting through tomorrow, and work in the future.  What are your suggestions Reddit?

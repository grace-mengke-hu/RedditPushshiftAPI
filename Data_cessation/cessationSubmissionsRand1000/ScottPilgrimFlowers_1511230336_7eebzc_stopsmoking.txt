Probably steer clear of the casino

Was looking forward to a night out with friends, wasting a little money on slots, but the acrid smell of the casino as I walked in was overwhelming, the smoke sticking to everything and seemingly coming from everywhere. It was disgusting, and it made me think of what I walked around carrying all the time... But it also made me want a cigarette, despite my otherwise strong resolve, and I'm sure some of the secondhand smoke carried some nicotine my way so I'm a little aggravated even today and thinking about smoking more than I have in weeks.

Anyway I know you're supposed to go on as normal after quitting but a smoke-filled casino you might want to avoid at least for the first month or two or, you know, forever.

What I'm doing: Deep breaths, let the lingering cravings pass, just avoid these kind of situations in the future. (Lost $40 anyway.) 18 days strong. I've got this, you've got this.

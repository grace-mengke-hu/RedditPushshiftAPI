Cinnamon Apple Spice tea and nicotine cravings

I've noticed that drinking a cup of Celestial Seasonings Cinnamon Apple Spice *seems to* curb nicotine withdrawal. I haven't had the same effect with their other herbal teas, despite sharing most of the same ingredients.

I know that a lot of people have used cinnamon sticks to quit, but it is believed that the effect is purely psychological. I'm wondering if cinnamon also has chemicals that bind to the same receptors on neurons as nicotine.

Has anyone else experienced a reduction in cravings after ingesting cinnamon? Might this be a real pharmacological effect, or just a placebo? I'd also love to hear from anyone on this sub with expertise in neurology.

Almost caved and still struggling.

Today is day 41. I haven't smoked a cigarette in 41 days.

I was at work and was extremely stressed out...like ready to pull my hair out stressed. I went outside to vape (not allowed to vape inside anymore after a few assholes ruined it for the rest of us). Everyone around me was smoking my brand...OMG...it smelled so good! 

The other thing I'm noticing is that everything tastes...off. It's not that it doesn't taste good...it just tastes funny. I haven't had an appetite because anything I put into my mouth just tastes weird. I smoked off and on for a decade and I'm now seeing the effects it had on me now that I'm not smoking. Strong smells turn my stomach so quickly I'm like a pregnant woman with morning sickness. I haven't eaten a full meal in almost a week because nothing tastes right and the slightest bad smell has my stomach in knots. I found myself dry heaving as I cleaned out the litter box this morning...and I'm the same person who sat in a room with a dead body that was decomposing without flinching.

There's a huge part of me that wants to smoke again...the vape just isn't cutting it. I am having a hard time dealing with this part of quitting. I love cooking, but I can't because it either smells bad or tastes weird. I have a garden that I can't be in because of the fertilizer and I've bathed my dogs and cats every day for the last week because they smell so horrible it makes me want to vomit.

I'm trying to be strong and it just sucks.

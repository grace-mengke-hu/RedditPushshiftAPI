Empathy and understanding addiction

My brother has substance abuse problems (cocaine, heroin, what have you) he is 37 years old. He ransacked my mothers house before being taken to rehab. I am 27 and a big smoker. I was one of those New Year quitters, but relapsed after only two weeks cold turkey. I used to be really hard on my brother, but I understand now how awful it is to be dependent on a substance. Quitting and then relapsing have made me realize how awful it must be for him... 
to end on a "funny" note: he was kicked out of rehab after two weeks for initiating a coup in the rehab facilities... so, I guess he's hopeless.

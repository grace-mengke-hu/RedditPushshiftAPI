Feeling like crap

Is anyone else, early in quit, getting sudden waves of nausea and stomach yuck?  It just started today, day 6.  I'm just working, at computer  and all of a sudden just ick.  Feel like I'm going to vomit, and stomach is unhappy.  Could just be coincidence and I got a bug, not sure.  I'm not going to smoke, but I feel pretty awful today.

I can't believe it...

I am not sure I have ever been so proud of me! After 15 years of smoking a pack a day I have went 7 days cold turkey. I feel great! I can't say I don't miss it some that would be a complete lie. Just breaking the habits is the hardest part. Feeling like I am forgetting to do something after I eat, after other things, before I go to bed, or everytime I go outside. It is getting easier I hope it continues to get easier every day! I fear I will be the person who forever thinks about smoking.

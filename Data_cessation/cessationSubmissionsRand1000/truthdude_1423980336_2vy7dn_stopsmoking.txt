117 days and going strong. Thank you, and may the will be with you!

I cannot believe that I passed by the 100 days mark without noticing. I haven't touched a cigarette and I don't even miss it. The times I do, I pick up my vape. And I'm now on 0% nic. I feel great and I know, everyone here has helped. Thank you and live strong.

here again..

still smoking, still hating myself! went a few days again, only to buy cigs.. again. I've tried for so many months now. I quit in May for 3 months with Allen Carr and it's just not working, I've also read "freedom of nicotine" and that isn't working either, the funny thing is, is that I know smoking is bullshit, but the anger, dread and hatred I get after a few days smoke free, always drives me back... Urgh, running out of ideas

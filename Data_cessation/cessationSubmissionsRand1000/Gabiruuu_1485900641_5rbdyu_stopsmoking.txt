Day 444

We all went trough the same challenge on quit smoking.

I also had a full of hope day 1.
An horrible day 2 full of anxiety.
A desperate day 3 even worst than day 2.
Bad thoughts and wishes on day 4.
....
Today is Day 444. It was a regular day. Not even for once thought about smoking. You'll get there. Just hang on!

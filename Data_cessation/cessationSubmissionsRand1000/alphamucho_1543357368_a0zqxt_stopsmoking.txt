Today i felt cravings after very long time

Today is my 25th day of quitting, and i was doing fine since last week without any serious cravings, But today is different.
All day i feel depressed and just wanted one cigarette. But now after 7-8 hours of depression and mental war i am finally over that feeling and very happy that i didn't smoked.
I read so many post here today just to distract my self and they are really helpful, thanks everyone

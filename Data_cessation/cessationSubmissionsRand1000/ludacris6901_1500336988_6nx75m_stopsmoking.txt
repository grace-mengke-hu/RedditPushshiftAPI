Wrecked my car. Didnt smoke.

Im not smoking today.......

EDIT: Im ok i just backed into a big yellow concrete pole because i didnt see it. Back of my car is all messed up but its not a huge deal. Still a great opportunity for the nicotine monster to try to get me to smoke though i had to talk myself through it out loud. Had to have a conversation with myself on why i shouldnt and dont need to smoke. It sounds stupid but it worked.

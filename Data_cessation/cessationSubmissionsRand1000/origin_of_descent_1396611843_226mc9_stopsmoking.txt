Day 10-- Phlegm and Irregular Sleep

Hi everyone,
So I've hit day 10 and feel great. Cravings are minimized and easily ignored. The biggest consequences of quitting (so far) have been morning buildups of phlegm (my cilia are alive again!!) and highly irregular (for me) sleeping patterns. 

Anyone else have the same issues, and any potential tips?

The phlegm I understand as my lungs are starting to clean themselves out finally. I wonder how longer the process will last. But the sleeping part s more alarming. I used to be able to fall asleep fairly quickly and then the next thing I knew it would be 8 hours later. These days it's more difficult to fall asleep, I wake up at least once around 3 or 4 am every night, and by 7am I'm wide awake--I used to sleep til 9 or later if I could but that seems like an impossibility now. 

Any feedback/tips/advice/warnings/anecdotes are welcome from my fellow smokers. Good luck on your journeys, and thanks for all the support thus far.

Boom, one year down

This is the longest I've gone without smoking, and I made it through the first couple of months thanks to you guys. I've no idea why this attempt (one of dozens) was the successful one, previous attempts have seen me last a week or so tops. 

Life is much better at this end, so for those of you who are starting out stick with it because the difference in health at this point is excellent!

Keep on not smoking friends!

Looking for a video.

Roughly 2 months ago some one posted a video that was 1 hour long. It was a man talking about allen carr's method and explaining it. This helped me quit for one month then a road trip kind of put me off track. I'm having trouble stopping again as i'm working 12 hours shifts doing nothing and getting bored, few little annoyances through out the night don't help.

Anyway i dont want to justify it, does any one know where i can find this video again?

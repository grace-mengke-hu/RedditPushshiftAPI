The mental tricks and first day

I'm going to try to quit again tommorow, Anyone have tips? My problem is my mind goes a little wacky, like the "well youre going to die anyway" "whats the point in quitting if youll want one again your whole life" kinda deal. I mean im aware of the mental addiction but that side of my brain wins over the wanting to quit side so far. Anyone have those problems and whatd you do to succeed over it?

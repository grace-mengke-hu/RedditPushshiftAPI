You’re an addict. So be addicted.

Just be addicted to something else. 

It’s not getting it out of your body that’s the problem, it’s getting it out of your mind.

I’m at day 26 now and feel fantastic. Started with weight loss, then added a little gym routine,  and quit smoking somewhere halfway. Didn’t feel right to suck on a fag after a set on the elliptical. I can do two sets in a row now. Seeing this progress is very motivating to keep going. I am at my lowest weight since early teens. Maybe I’ll cut the drink next. Also, with the money I saved I bought myself a massive jar of protein powder that can last a month or two (my daily intake is low on it).

Life didn’t get any less stressful than before, but now I blow my steam exercising, and I take my mind off things by taking the time to write down the calories in my journal. The same time I would spend poisoning myself with tobacco. This shit is my new addiction, and I’m sticking to it. Not another puff!

Keep grinding people, and stay savage! You all are a great inspiration to me!

Celebrating my first star with a book-giveaway (Allen Carr book in german)

Hey stopsmoking! I'm a month smoke free now, feeling good. The cravings are still there from time to time, but I definitely can handle those, piece of cake.  I've been out drinking, I've been to a stag do even, didn't give in.

Now: To celebrate I'm giving away my copy of *Das große Allen-Carr-Nichtraucher-Buch: Zwei Bücher in einem Band - Endlich Nichtraucher! - Für immer Nichtraucher! "*

If you want to quit (and speak german), I'll send it to you for just the postal fees (EU-shipping makes most sense, otherwise it's cheaper to order from Amazon), drop me a PM, first come, first serve, no strings attached, although it  would of course be nice if you could do the same for someone else, some day.

EDIT: And we have a winner. The book goes to  /u/antistatikk from Germany. He's been off the cancersticks since tuesday, I hope the book helps him succeed. Also he agreed to send it on, once he's finished with it, so I'm gonna follow kweek25's suggestion and peel the book out of its wrapper to sign it before sending it on its way. Maybe we get a nice list of happy /r/stopsmoking users this way.

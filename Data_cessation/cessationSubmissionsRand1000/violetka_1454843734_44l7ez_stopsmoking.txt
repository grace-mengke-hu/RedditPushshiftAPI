starting my day 4

Hello everyone I am starting my day 4. I feel no withdrawal symptoms, have very few cravings definitely more mental than physical. However am coughing quite a lot and feel a burning sensation in my lungs. Also in the morning i had dry throat and difficulty breathing...Which is weird, shoult it not be getting easier to breath? Instead it is getting worse...

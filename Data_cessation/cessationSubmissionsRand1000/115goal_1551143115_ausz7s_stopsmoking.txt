1 month and 28 days smoke free, and it was all easy breezy lemon squeezy at first, but the past two days I have been experiencing crazy, desperate cravings!!!

I haven't smoked a puff yet, but man oh man, do I FEEL TEMPTED. I feel so like, "most people who quit start again anyways right???? so might as well smoke bitch" but I know that's literally -1 logic, but shit. I just feel super sad and frustrated this month and it was only two nights ago that I walked into the bathroom (where my mom keeps her cigarettes) that I was like.....hmmm....that seems like a great way to feel this sadness even more. if that makes sense.

anyways I haven't smoked. I'm not adding the word "yet" to that sentence because that would imply I believe I eventually will...but I'm trying really hard to believe I won't.

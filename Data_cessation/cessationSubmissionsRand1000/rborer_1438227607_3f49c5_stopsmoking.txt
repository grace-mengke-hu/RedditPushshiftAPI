Does anyone have a hard time envisioning themself as a non smoker?

Im at work sitting here having my cravings... and I just keep daydreaming and trying to imagine myself as a non smoker and am having a hard time... Cigarettes have been there for me since I was 13 and im 30 now so more than half my life... Im not going to stumble and smoke again but I just have a hard time seeing myself as a nonsmoker... Is this normal?

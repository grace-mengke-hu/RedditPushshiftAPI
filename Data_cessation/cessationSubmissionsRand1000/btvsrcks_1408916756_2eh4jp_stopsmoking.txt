I need to quit

I have been smoking most of the last 20 years. My husband didn't tell his parents and makes me hide it from them, which I hate (his dad smoked and apparently hates smokers... Sigh...) 

I went along with this for him but now, in October, we are going on a 2 week cruise with his parents. I know I have needed to quit for a long time but I just don't know what to do with myself. I sit outside and smoke every day. I enjoy it. I get sun, wind, rain on me and feel closer to nature (sounds dumb I know) but I just want this to be over. I don't want to hide things about me from his parents, but rather than coming out, I want to quit for good. Can it be done? I'm about to smoke after posting this. Does it make me a bad person? Argh...

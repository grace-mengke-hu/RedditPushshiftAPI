Trying to quit, have a hard time beating cravings

I was so happy to find this subreddit. I hope I can get motivated to quit this disgusting habit. It started out as a social thing, I hated the taste, the smell, the way it made me feel... until, well, until I didn't anymore. About a month ago I started getting seriously addicted. I'm smoking a pack every 3 days, and I'm noticing how much of a hold it has on me. I tried quitting yesterday, but I was so moody and so stressed out that I couldn't help myself. I'm trying again today. Any advice for coping with the cravings?

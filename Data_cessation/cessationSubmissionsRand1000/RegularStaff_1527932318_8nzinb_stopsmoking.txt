If you're thinking of picking up a smoke...

Dont!

I messed up my quit this morning, smoked 2 cigs.

I'm posting this to let people know that they don't taste as nice as you remember!  The relief you get IS NOT any different to that of any NRT or just letting the craving pass (if you are going cold turkey)

The only thing I am left with now is a reset badge and a sense of letting myself down big time.

I am back on my quit now, even more determined, I just do not want someone making the same mistake as me.

I have no excuse apart from I got up and saw my partners cigarettes and smoked.  It gets you nothing at all apart from another day 1.

I hope this is my last day 1, just wanted to share my mistake in the hope it encourages those in the same position NOT to do the same.

Have a good day.  I will not smoke with you for the rest of the day.

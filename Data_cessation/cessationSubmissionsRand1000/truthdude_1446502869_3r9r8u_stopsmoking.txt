Here we go. Again.

After about a year of quitting, I got back into it. And it was nuts.
For about a month, maybe more, I smoked. And tbh, it was glorious.
This morning, I got back from work and I heard news of a friend, not much older, who passed away - not because of smoking. But it was a wake up clarion that reminded me of what I'm doing.
So I'm back to r/stopsmoking. And I hope to do just that for good.
Thanks for being here.

One Year. Strong.

I saw a r/stopsmoking post on my front page and popped in to see what my counter was at. 375 days. Wow. This is the longest I have been tobacco free in 15 years. I couldn't be more satisfied.

You will get here too. One week, one month, six months, one year. 

Not one puff ever.

Stay strong, and remember, just get through the urge, get through the day, it'll be easier tomorrow, and then one day, kid you not, you won't even remember what is was like to be a smoker.

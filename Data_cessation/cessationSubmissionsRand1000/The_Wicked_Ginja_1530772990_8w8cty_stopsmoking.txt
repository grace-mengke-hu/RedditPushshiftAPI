No coughing

As I've read a lot of posts, I've noticed everyone has talked about coughing. I remember when my sister would try to quit smoking and would cough like crazy.   I expected that when I quit. 

I think I've coughed once since I quit smoking.  It was a dry cough, though, because there was a tickle in my throat. Is it unusual that I haven't coughed?  I've just felt lucky.  I smoked a pack a day for over 20 years.

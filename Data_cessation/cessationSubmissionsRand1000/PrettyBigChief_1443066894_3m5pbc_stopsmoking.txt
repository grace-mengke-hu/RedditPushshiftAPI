First day of fall!

With my "new" nose, seasonal changes are just amazing. Summer into fall has to be the best. Spring ain't bad either. Spring into summer sucks. Anyway.

I cannot wait for that first whiff of wood smoke from burning leaves. I live in TX so it'll be a few weeks, but, worth the wait.

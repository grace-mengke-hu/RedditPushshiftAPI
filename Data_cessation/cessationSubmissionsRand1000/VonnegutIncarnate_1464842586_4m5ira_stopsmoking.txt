So, I quit about 5 hours ago. What should I expect?

I was smoking and realized I wasn't enjoying it at all. I decided just to see how long I could go without smoking. Well, it's been 5 hours and I think this might become a long term thing. What should I expect? How bad are the withdrawls? How long do cravings last? I don't smoke very much, maybe 5 or 6 a day.What is it gong to be like? Please be completely honest.

JONESIN' BAD

Ok so I've had a SLEW of shitty news thrown at me in the past couple days.  Not like just annoying news, but very shitty FML news.  I have been cig-free for 10 days and this may be the worst day yet. I am wanting a smokey treat - that dopamine hit and "ahhhh" factor.  Scale of 1 - 10? 15.  This sucks!!!!

5.5 months off then went back to it on holiday

Like the title says I was nearly 6 months in doing really well and not even missing it, in fact I felt sorry for smokers still trapped by their addictions. 

Well...a couple of weeks ago I went on holiday to Egypt with my sister who smokes. Sheâ€™s a smoker so I knew it could be a high risk situation but felt confident about it. First night we went to a shisha bar and the guy promised me he could do one with no tobacco and no nicotine just fruit flavouring so I decided to have one. The next day I was having a lot of cravings and thought it was weird, Googled it and thereâ€™s definitely no such thing as tobacco free shisha ðŸ˜¡

Sort of hit the fuck it button then and been back to smoking 20 a day for the last two weeks. I already have a smokers cough and can really feel how itâ€™s doing my body no favours. Just threw away my fags half an hour ago and reset my app, hoping it will be easier than last time because itâ€™s only been two weeks back on it? 

Writing this to give me something to do while waiting for the bus and I can smell someone smoking nearby. And to let you know that it deff does get so much easier but that the addiction will always be waiting for us unfortunately. Wish me luck!

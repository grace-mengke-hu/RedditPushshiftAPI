When do I stop being worried I'll fail (again)?

Today is Day 23. Patches and lozenges. Days 20-23 have been hell, I was expecting a rough patch at 3 weeks, I met it. I've never made it to this point, but after all y'all's experiences, I knew I was in for a bumpy ride. Fine. Cool. Yeah, I'm having a hard time, but I'm surviving.

Question though... Every day, I wonder when I'll fail. Not thinking "I might do this, I can do this, I feel strong". Never strong. Every free minute of the day where my attention can wander, my first thought is "what do I do if I fuck up now?" I can't imagine what my life will look like in a year, or five years, much less 40. But for the longest time I thought "don't know where I'll be, but my one constant is always smoking". Now that I don't have that, I don't have anything. When does my mind stop wandering to smoking? When do I stop fearing failure? Will I ever be able to walk past a smoker and not lust? Will I ever be able to date a smoker? Will I ever be able to go about my day without it being in the forefront of my mind, with the accompanying terror that I'm never going to successfully claw my way out of this?

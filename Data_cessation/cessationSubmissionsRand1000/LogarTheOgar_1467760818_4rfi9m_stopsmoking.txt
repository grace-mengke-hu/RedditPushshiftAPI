How do you drink and not smoke? How do you be around smoke and not smoke? How smoke, then not smoke smoke smoke?

I had surgery in May. They told me not to smoke before the surgery, so I figured "well, if I can't smoke, and it's on my list of things to do right now, I might as well just stop."

I went over 6 weeks without a cigarette. I was also sort of on bed rest for 6 weeks. I thought it was all out of my system. As soon as I got back home, and went to the bar to see friends, I immediately wanted cigarettes.

Why does drinking make you want cigarettes? Why do they pair so well together? Am I lonely? Do I want to fit in? Do I romanticize the idea of a beer and a cigarette?

I wanted to go out and be social because I had been inside for 6 weekends straight and I guess I overdid it. Some of my friends smoke, but nowadays most of them don't.

The hangover from the first night where I had 2 cigarettes was almost non-existent. The hangover from the next night where I bought a pack before I went out was absolutely dreadful.

AND FOR SOME REASON WHEN I WOKE UP I WENT AND BOUGHT CIGARETTES BECAUSE I FELT LIKE SHIT AND THAT WOULD SOMEHOW MAKE ME FEEL BETTER WHAT THE HELL IS THAT.

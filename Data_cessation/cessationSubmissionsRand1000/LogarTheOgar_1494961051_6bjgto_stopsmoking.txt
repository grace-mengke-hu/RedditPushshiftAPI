Day 15 - Grumpy McDepressionFace

This is my second time this year that I got to 15 days completely smoke free. No drunk cigarettes, no "just ones" to take the edge off; nothing.

First week was ok. I worked out every day, it put the goodgood chemicals in my body and the anxiety was nill.

Week two was ok as well. I was confident that I was making the right decision. My life is finally getting on track and all I have to do is stick to the plan I made myself!

Week three.... holy balls. I woke up miserable yesterday and today. Im walking around a hot workplace grimmacing at all the work I dont want to do. Im snapping at people when they ask me to do things becauae goddamnt Im already doing something. I dont want to be here. I dont want to be anywhere. I want to go home and get a pack of cigs and feel like shit and play playstation for 6 hours.

Ive given myself prizes. Ive told myself the only thing Im really focused on right now is quitting smoking, that everything elses is secondary; as long as I dont smoke, its pretty much ok.

But this week I just want to give it up. The lethargy is killing me. Im angry/sad for no reason with no desire to actually do anything. Ive "had depression" for a long time. I take medicine but sometimes, like today, I have nothing to lean on. I dont want to work the job I have but it's not like I can go home, get a new one and start tomorrow.

Going home and smoking wont fix anything but neither will working on the stuff I want to work on (writing, music). I dont have the brain energy to do anything. Im tired and grumpy and miserable.

And I want to thank this sub for being here when I need it. The 300 days posts are great for me. Its hard in a world of instant gratification to put stock in something that takes a long time to complete.

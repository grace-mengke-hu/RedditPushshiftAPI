Can I not smoke with you tomorrow? (Three years)

I used to spend a lot of time around here.  Today is my third year anniversary of being nicotine free -- I quit smoking about 6 weeks before that.  But I mark being drug free as the major holiday.

Back in my heyday.  We had some people who took it one day at a time:  They would just not smoke today.  That moved into 'I will not smoke with you' and sometimes into 'I will not smoke while I think of you.'  When quitting was feeling easy, it was worth remembering how hard the first days were.  When it was becoming a grind, it was worth remembering how precious it was.

I don't spend much time around here now.  But I stay subscribed.  I don't have cravings; I don't have smoking thoughts.  For me, all I have to do is remember one thing:  I can not smoke or I can smoke a pack and a quarter a day until I die.  It is a simple choice *now*.

I won't smoke tomorrow.  Whenever there is a pause in my day, a few minutes where I might have stepped outside,  I will think of the people just starting on this wonderful journey.  

Can I not smoke with you tomorrow?  It would honor me.  

I am rooting for you all.  I am still grateful for all my quit-brothers and sisters.

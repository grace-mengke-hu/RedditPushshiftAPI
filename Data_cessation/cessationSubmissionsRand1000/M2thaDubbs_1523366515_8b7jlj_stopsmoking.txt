Oh my goodness...

3 weeks in and I thought I was home free... but I've been having cravings the past 2 days. I was at a smoker friend's house last night and I knew I wouldn't smoke but I definitely had the urge. Then again this morning. I'm going on vaca tomorrow and i just really hope I don't give in. I hope these urges kick rocks. 

I guess I would like some reassurance that this is temporary and similar experiences from everyone (hopefully ones that ended well)!

Edit: also reminders of how evil this shit is and how we don't actually like it!

And also... I won't those of you in the first few days of quitting to know that the urges aren't that's strong. This is abnormal. The bad cravings ended after day 4 and I don't want to discourage anyone or make anyone think that the bad cravings last all the way into week 3. The don't... this feels more nostalgic than anything so don't let me discourage you!

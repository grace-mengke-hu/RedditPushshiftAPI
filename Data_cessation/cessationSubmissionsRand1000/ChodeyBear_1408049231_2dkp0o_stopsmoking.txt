Helppppp! Going on a 2 week holiday with my chain-smoking stresshead father.

So I'm flying out to Singapore on Saturday to visit my dad, who chain smokes and is constantly stressed and on edge (it's his personality - he's like that even when not smoking). We've had a bit of a weird relationship all my life so it usually brings up old emotions when I spend time with him.

I guess I need some strong words of advice / reassurance to get me through.

There's wifi in his house so I'll pop in if I need to!

Ps... 2 months today :D

Waited 24 hours to smoke a cigarette.

And by god this is terrible. 

Not only does it taste like shit, but the nicotine high is filthy. It's not even comfortable. I waited 24 hours to see what it's like smoking when I haven't smoked one every hour. I feel my lungs suffocating. I feel the nausea kicking in. When I got up to walk back inside I felt dizzy and sick. 

If you want to quit, but don't feel like you can do it, wait 24 hours. Then smoke a cigarette. You'll feel so stupid for being sucked in to such a meaningless and disgusting habit. 

This is the last one. This is NOT worth it by any means.

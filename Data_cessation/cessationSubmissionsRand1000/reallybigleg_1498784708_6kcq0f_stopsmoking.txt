Had one....

I've been up all night crying. It's a long story. Finally just didn't care anymore and went to nick a housemate's cigarettes.

And now I'm sat up with the lights on because it just made me incredibly anxious and made my chest hurt.

It didn't even make me feel better when I was smoking it. This entire thing has made my ordeal worse, not better.

So if you're quitting and you think: Ah, I'll just have one, take it from me: Not worth it.

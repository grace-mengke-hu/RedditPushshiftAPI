Worst Craving Yet

So for the last three months before deciding to quit, I've been extraordinarily depressed. I caught my wife with another man, we separated, and now she's with him. I'm a strong person in general, I think, but I've never felt lower in my life.

But I pulled myself out of it. I was feeling good again. I decided to quit smoking last week and it has really helped me regain some of the self confidence that being so horribly emasculated can destroy. I've been starting to really cultivate a presence on the dating websites. Actually trying to meet someone finally.

And then today I go and do a stupid thing -- I hop on Facebook and look at her work's page, where there's a picture of the two of them together at some work party.

Gut punch! I'm still at work and just trying not to cry until I leave.

And as counter-productive as it would be, all I fucking want to do right now is go home and suck down half a bottle of whiskey and a pack of cigarettes while sobbing uncontrollably. Which is pretty what I'd been doing for the last three months.

I'm not going to do it. I'm going to get a haircut, go home and run with my dog, do some laundry, cook a healthy dinner, and relax with Netflix.

I will not let my demons break my resolve. I've come too far.

Sob story over. Thanks for reading.

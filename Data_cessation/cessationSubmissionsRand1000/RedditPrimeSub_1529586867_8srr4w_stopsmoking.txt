Patch Advice

I have been cutting down on smoking with NRT, quick mist and gum.  I am currently smoking approx 9 cigs a day.  Finally my nic patches have arrived, i ordered both the 21 and 14 mg versions.  Wondering if i should start with the 21 mg or 14 mg versions of the patch?

Any advice is appreciated.  BTW my quit time is tomorrow around 7pm after work.

Thank you

It is Friday - share your positive thoughts, actions, realizations and plans!

I have been quit less than a week so far and I have noticed that I need MUCH less perfume than I thought. My nose is currently burning and I grimace every time I think of how I must have smelled...the cigarettes plus all the perfume UGH!! The positive is that I will use much less and it will last longer!

Also I plan to get my car detailed - I mean really splurge on an intense interior detailing. Might as well get all the ash, smell and gross out now! 

What are some silly, funny or unusual things you have noticed since you quit, that you weren't expecting?


Stay strong and have a wonderfully clean breathing weekend!

I don't think nicotine patches deserve the stigma they get here - they can be a useful quitting aid. 2 1/2 months of non smoking for me so far.

I've not smoked for 2 and half months thanks to Nicotine patches and it's been entirely tolerable - I'm working my way down on the patch strength, I've gone from the 21g down to the middle strength (?) this week and had no issues. Not much craving now, if you're considering it and struggle giving up cold turkey I would really give it a shot. 

It's been practically pain free for me so far, and some days I even forget I don't have a patch on!

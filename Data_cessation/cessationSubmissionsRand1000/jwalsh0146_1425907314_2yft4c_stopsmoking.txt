Day 10 with NRT.

Hello all

Second attempt to quit this month and I'm doing pretty good although it is with NRT.

A few things id like to share. NRT is good but you just have to lIve with the nicotine monster. You may not think about cigarettes all the time but you will think about gum/e cig and prolong the withdrawl systems until you stop using the NRT for however long it is your using it. 

My goal is to get to that point where cigarettes look smell and give me that feeling it did when I was six at my uncle's house and there were 4 full ash trays (1980s don't judge). And it was revolting. And then hopefully I can do the NRT cold turkey and get on with my life. 

3-4 2mg of gum
1 puff period on e cig at night

Edit: my bad. Got ahead of myself.  8 full days, this is day 9.

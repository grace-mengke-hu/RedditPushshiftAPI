One of my tougher days, cravings-wise

So this happened in my city yesterday: a man drove a rented van into pedestrians on one of the main streets in the north end of my city, killing ten people, mostly women, and injuring 14 or so others. From all accounts so far this guy isn’t a “terrorist”, at least not a religious one, he’s someone who is, aside from being obviously deranged, is also angry that women don’t want to date him.

Anyway I had to wait until this morning to find out whether some people I care about and who live in the exact area, and who would feasibly have been on that sidewalk at that exact time (like one friend I knew would have left for home about 20 minutes before the attack, which if she got out of the subway at the wrong moment could easily have been hit, she lives right there FFS) are in fact ok. Thank god they are, but of course others are not. A small trauma compared to what others are going through, but I’ve felt it nevertheless. And boy did the smoking cravings hit hard and steady all day. I didn’t smoke because I know well that smoking won’t solve anything including the cravings, but I would say today was one of my hardest days yet. Stress is not my friend. Let’s hope tomorrow is a better day, I really want to go and add to the memorial and pay my respects but I don’t know if I can handle that much emotion right now.

Thanks for listening :)

Haven't had a cigarette since Saturday.

Gonna kick its ass this time! Trying patches, and its better than the first time I quit. I had it beaten for 7 years the first time, then I started sucking the stupid sticks again. Quit cold turkey the first time, but my stress level is dramatically higher this time around.

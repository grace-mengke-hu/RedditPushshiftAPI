Fuck that

I got in a nasty bike wreck last Thursday. Luckily nothing broken but I've been mostly bed ridden for the last two days... which means I also have not been smoking. This evening I was finally feeling well enough that I could limp downstairs and drive my wife to meet a friend of hers. I drove home, stopped at subway and ordered my favorite sandwich. I was walking (limping) back to the car when I passed a liquor store and thought "I deserve a drink to celebrate no broken bones." I walked in and asked for a 1 liter bottle of Jim Beam and took a really really long look at a back of Camels. I thought to myself, "Don't I deserve a smoke too? After all that was a really scary bicycle accident and all." I thought a moment longer before coming to a conclusion I should have come to a while ago: "Fuck that." 

I promised my ex-girlfriend that I would quit when I graduated from undergrad. I promised my wife that I would stop when I graduated from law school. I promised her I would stop by the time we got married. I promised myself countless times on countless occasions that I was going to stop for the last 11 years. Fuck it. Fuck smoking. I know this is all just talk but fuck this. I am so done. I have wanted to quit for so long but have not been brave enough to try. I'm not going to slowly limp up and down the three flights of stairs to my house because I cant stop smoking. 

This may just be talk but it is also going to be day 1.

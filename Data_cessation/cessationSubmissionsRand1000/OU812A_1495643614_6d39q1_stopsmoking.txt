Back on the wagon... again. Just like Mark Twain said: 'Giving up smoking is the easiest thing in the world. I know because I've done it thousands of times.'

Last run lasted about 41 days, then a re-lapse for 2 months. I am losing faith in myself and reading about odds not being in my favor, I'm wondering - is it really a mind vs. habit or am I just not committed? Either way, wish me luck. It's been a tough first 24 hours, but lozenges help.. 

Though: immediately noticed I did not wake up in the middle of the night, like I had before. I am also able to finish a sentence without gasping for breath. I woke up less depressed this morning. So, I got that going for me, which is nice. In other news, I am able to ~~tell~~ smell it's time to buy a new pair of shoes. :-D

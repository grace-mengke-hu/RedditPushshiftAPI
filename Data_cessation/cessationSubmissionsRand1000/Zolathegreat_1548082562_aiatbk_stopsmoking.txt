I'm having such a hard time

During the last month or so I had and still have craving. I'm trying really hard but I don't know if this torture is ever going stop. I don't know why did it hit me like this after 8,5 months of quit. I should have stopped long time ago. First three months were the hardest, but this time it came unexpected. I'm giving everything stay an ex-smoker. I thing that second hand smoking reactivated my addiction. I was in a hospital for 1 month and everybody smoked. So, I think that this is what happened, but I'm not sure. Anyway, have a good day.

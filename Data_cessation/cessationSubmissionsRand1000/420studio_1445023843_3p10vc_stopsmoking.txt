Day 18

I have not craved a ciggerette today. It has been a very pleasant Friday so far which is amazing considering the past two days felt like day 2 and 3. I guess what I'm saying is just hang in there. 18 days is not very far and I know I am still on the front line of this battle but not craving a cig is an amazing feeling and I hope to continue feeling this way. 

Also, not smelling like fucking shit all the time is pretty cool too.

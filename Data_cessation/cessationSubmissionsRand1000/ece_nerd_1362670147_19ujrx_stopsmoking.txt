90 Days...Been through a lot but stayed strong...Joy>Pleasure

I originally quit smoking as a promise to my girlfriend.  We ended up breaking up about a week ago due to us being each other's only significant relationships and uncertainty if we are really 'right' for each other (I could go in to more detail, as I am still emotionally distraught over this, but this is not the proper forum).  Instead of being urged to return to the habit of smoking I've actually gone in the other direction by quitting smoking weed, beginning a workout routine, and starting to eat healthier.  In addition I've begun the process of doing things for me such as going to the gun range, joining a tech/nerd club at my school, and going camping this coming weekend.

I just want people to know that the best way to counter a traumatic experience in your life is not to choose pleasure but to choose joy.  Pleasure only satisfies you in the moment by taking a puff or a sip but Joy is a satisfaction that you will continue to feel.

Stay strong!

EDIT: P.S.  I had a cigar while I was drunk at a beer festival but I swear I didn't inhale.

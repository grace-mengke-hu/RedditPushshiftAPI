2 weeks already?

I can't say the time has flown or that I haven't been paying attention. I'm getting there one day at a time. I just feel so damn proud of myself, lately. Now *that* is new! I rewarded myself with a new pair of shoes and 2 discs for disc golf :) I can't wait to go play a round without having to look like douche while smoking on the course. 



What ways have you rewarded yourself?

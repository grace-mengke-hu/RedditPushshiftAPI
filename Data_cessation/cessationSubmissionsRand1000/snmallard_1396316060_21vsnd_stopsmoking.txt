Had my last cigarette on Friday and today is by far the worst day so far.

I had my last cigarette on Friday night and woke up on Saturday morning and felt like I never wanted a cigarette again, so that's when I decided to make the effort to quit. I've been smoking since 19 but become a regular smoker at probably 20, I'm now 24.  I didn't leave the house on Saturday and got through the day pretty easy. It was Sunday that got a little tough because I had to do a few errands and I have the habit of lighting one up when I get in the car.


I decided to buy patches when I was out. My boss swears on them and at least if they weren't working too well, I could tell myself, "no, you can't smoke cause you have the patch on." And you can't have a cigarette for a few hours even after taking the patch off. My first patch definitely felt like it helped.


Today has been the toughest day so far. It was my first day back to work after quitting, I usually go out every 2 hours or so for a cigarette break, it's even harder cause I don't have to ask, I just go. Most of the people at my work smoke too. Not to mention my boyfriend and two roommates.


I noticed my triggers are in the car and after a meal. My jaw has been tight all day and my eyes feel swollen. I also have had some anxiety on and off. The weirdest part is that I noticed cigarette smoke makes me feel better, not worse.


I just can't wait until I'm done with this stage.


***EDIT*** I decided to test out sleeping with the patch on for the first night. Big mistake, I had extremely vivid dreams and I woke up every hour. I went back to sleep no problem, but the dream would pick up right where it left off each time. They were weird things too, like my grandfather telling me he was getting ready to go to "the countryside with his parents." 1. We're from Boston and don't use the term "countryside." 2. His parents haven't been alive since at least 25 years ago. Now I know not to sleep with it.

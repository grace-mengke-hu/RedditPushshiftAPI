Well that was weird

Whoa, I’m over 60 days in, feeling pretty ok about it all (great actually), but just now I had this weird moment where for about 2 minutes I literally forgot that I was a non smoker and walked around my apartment looking for my pack of smokes so that I could go have one on my balcony... whoa!!! It’s not that I had a craving particularly, my brain just went into autopilot mode and stayed there for quite a long time - usually the “time for a smoke” moments are immediately followed with “oops no it isn’t” thoughts. That’s the first time that happened since I quit. Weird!!! It’s like my addiction was seriously trying to fuck with me there!

Not going to smoke of course, but wow that was a strange moment lol

Made it thru yesterday - hot damn!

I've had an extremely shitty week so far, and yesterday I felt like I was going to jump off a very tall bridge if I didn't have a smoke.  I had to break out the ecig for a bit, but I didn't light up.  So I consider that a victory.  Plus, no bridges were affected.

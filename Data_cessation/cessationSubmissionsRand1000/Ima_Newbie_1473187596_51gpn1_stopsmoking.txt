Sometimes it's NOT really a craving...

Brain Pathways are, to me, a lot like Muscle Memory. Basically, something enters your brain thru your senses, and triggers a chain reaction of neurons firing in a way that they have fired many, many times before... to the point they created a sort of pathway within your brain and once you enter onto that path, your thought process tries to follow it thru to the usual result.

Case in Point:  The instant I pulled into the Exxon station (sensory trigger) I immediately made a mental calculation of how much cash I had and whether or not it was 'enough' (for a pack of cigs) or whether I'd need to use my debit card.

Let me make one thing clear... I was NOT craving nicotine that moment, nor did I wish to buy a pack of cigs or smoke a single cigarette. I was there to get a pack of bacon.

This was just weird Brain Pathway thingy that played like an old familiar record in my head, based on the many, many times I had had those thoughts while pulling into that very Exxon.

I found it interesting and curious and wanted to share. Sometimes what might seem like cravings aren't cravings at all. They are the ghosts of past behaviors ingrained in our brains.

Can anyone relate a similar experience?

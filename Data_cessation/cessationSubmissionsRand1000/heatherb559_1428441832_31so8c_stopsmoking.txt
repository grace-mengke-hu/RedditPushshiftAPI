Crazier things have happened I suppose

I woke up this morning and my baby sister was crashed on my couch. I knew there would be smokes in her car. I thought that I could just snag a few. I wanted it so bad. I wasn't thinking like I have been for the last month. All rational thinking was lost. I just wanted it soooo bad. Then I accidentally clicked the reddit icon instead of the Facebook one. And here I was, and you all saved me from myself. All day I was in a pissy mood. Sick of my job and all the bullshit and the stupid clouds and everything and everyone. Then at lunch my coworkers gave me a round of applause, you would have thought someone had passed out shots the way they hooted and howled, all because I made it 38 days without a smoke. They have witnessed my struggle for the past 2 years... On the wagon... Off the wagon.. On the wagon... And so it went. I just want to give you all a round of applause, hooting and howling included. Thank you so much for propping me up when I can't do it on my own.

The Benefits of Quitting so far!

About to hit 10 days smoke free! For posterity, here's a couple of things that have vastly improved for me, even in this short time:

Â 


* **Coffee** I used to drink by the bucket, but affects me a lot more than it used to. I've had to cut down my consumption a lot!
* **Zzzzz** My quality of sleep is so much higher. I didn't even realise that my sleep was that bad until a few days into the quit. Babies don't sleep as well as I do.
* **How much better my clothes smell.** I know this is something that's always raised about quitting but I never really got it before. My fabric softener smells so gosh darn nice! My shampoo is lovely! *I can't stop smelling my own hair!*
* **My anxiety is so much more manageable.** I really can't stress this enough. I thought quitting would ruin me. I was already an anxious mess and I thought I didn't have the strength to quit, that it would be the nail in my coffin. I couldn't have been more wrong. Yes, I'm still anxious but I'm actually much better equipped to deal with it!  
* **My heart rate** used to truck along at a not-very-leisurely 89bpm. Which for a healthy-weight 25yo was pretty bad! Now I'm averaging about 60bpm!

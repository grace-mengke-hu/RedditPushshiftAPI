Third times the charm?

First time quitter as of the start of this month. I'd literally never even tried in the ten years I've smoked.

First try: almost two weeks. Fit of depression and I smoked for 11 days.

Second try: five days. I can't explain this one other than the mere THOUGHT of having some drinks on Friday compelled me to run out to the store and buy a pack after my first drink. Previously I'd handled one drink without issue, but I wanted to get bombed that night, I was alone, and I wanted to smoke while I did it. I smoked a total of three packs over the course of the weekend because of that.

Not a great track record with quitting. But I've quit, again, today.

Things I've learned: 

* Don't drink alone for a while.

* The next time I start to get depressed and/or start to seriously consider going to the gas station: re-read a chapter or two of the Easy Way.

* My brother is also quitting right now, and it sucks that I have to lie to him that I haven't smoked, because I don't want to interfere with his quit. Cigarettes make me a dirty liar, among other things. :-(

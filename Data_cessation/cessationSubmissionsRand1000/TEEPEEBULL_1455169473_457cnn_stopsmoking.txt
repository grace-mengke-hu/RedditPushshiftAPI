No Smoking Thoughts

Been a while since I put out my "last Butt" and I was having thoughts about it lately. In one way thinking how "proud" I am of myself for quitting this long, in another way thinking how easy I could get sucked back into it, and how stupid I was to ever to start in the first place. Nicotine is a seriously addictive drug!

All kinds of thoughts- but, I am not smoking again. Firm on that- thankfully. But the thing is, my brain has yet to stop tossing around thoughts about it. Positive or negative- but things always seem to pop up. I suppose once you have dived in, become nicotine addicted and carried on with it for a significant period of time, the thoughts will be there a long time after the fact. 

No picking it up for me though, not going back to lighting up...not considering vaping as a "safer thing", or smokeless tobacco either. Just reflecting... that's all.

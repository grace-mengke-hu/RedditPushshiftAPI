I realised smoking is ruining fun I could be having.

I went on a little fitness orientated weekend and cried with embarrassment. I'm 25, chubby and a 10 a day smoker for about 10 years. I felt in my 80s this weekend.

So, the intention was to mountain hike. I made it about a third up. To be fair, it was remarkably steep but every few metres or so my pulse shot up to 150, I couldn't breathe, my chest had a cold burn feel to it and I had to stop.

I saw people older than me, fatter than me and less equipped for the walk than me manage much better. I was being overtaken by literally everyone. I underestimated how difficult the mountain was but also how little I could breathe. My lungs felt like they were the size of a bauble.

I was so embarrassed and ashamed that I started to cry. I am disgusted that I've willingly ruined some opportunities for myself. I really wanted to get to the top. It made me think about what else I struggled to do because of my poor breathing.

I have to change. I want better for myself than this. I want to have fun. I want to swim, run and climb. I want to laugh without coughing. I want to lay in bed and not be on the verge of a panic attack because it feels like I'm breathing in a straw. Because it feels like my lungs can't expand.

I can't do things I want to do if I cannot breathe.

I stop smoking now.

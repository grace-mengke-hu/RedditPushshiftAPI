Been over eating like CRAZY, but now I can't taste anything...

Thought maybe it would help with the binge eating but now I just feel that icky empty insecurity more than ever. :( 

had a freak out incident at work that very nearly made me buy a pack. By all normal standards most people probably would have. But stayed strong. Still trying not to cry tho!

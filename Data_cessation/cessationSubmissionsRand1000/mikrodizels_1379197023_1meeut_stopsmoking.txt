Getting the ''buzz'' from air?

So here i am, trying to quit again. I usually smoke before every minor activity i do, like, before wathing a long movie, or before using public transport for a long time. Since today i was done with the last cig, i got a craving for a cig before watching ''This is The End'', so i went to my balcony(where i always smoke when i'm home), and just took loooong and deeeep breats of air at a fast pace, and i got a ''buzz''. It was stronger than the ussual buzz i have from cigs, the buzz that gives me that ''satisfing'' feeling after smoking, and my craving was gone'ish.  
Just wanted to share that with you, maybe it helps someone else, maybe even someone is using it regulary with large success.

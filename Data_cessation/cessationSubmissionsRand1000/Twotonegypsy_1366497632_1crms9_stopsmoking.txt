A month! Sweet victory!

A literal month.  31 days and I feel like a champion.  I will never smoke another cig again in my life time.  I have ended my days of needing cigs in my life.  It feels good.  I feel good.  

I went on a hike with my dad the other day who is an active smoker and was an enabler in my smoking habit.  He smoked on the hike, and wheezed, and coughed, and stopped multiple times.  I got to smell the beautiful air, enjoy the green scape while not having to worry about catching my breath.  Honestly, I owe a lot to /r/stopsmoking because I am around non smokers who do not know what it is like to quit anything.

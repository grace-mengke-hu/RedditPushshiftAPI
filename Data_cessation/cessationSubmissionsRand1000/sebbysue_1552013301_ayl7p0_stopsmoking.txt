Iâ€™ve been reading posts and commenting here and there.

You people have really helped me so much! Whenever I get cravings, I come here and I read your posts and respond to some and it all keeps me from having a cigarette. Pretty soon my craving is gone and I start the process all over again. I read things other people write and I see how responsive people are and it helps. It really does. Thank to all for your insight and helping me to not smoke today, even though you may not know it!

106 Days

It's been 106 days since my last cig.

106 days since I stopped buying, got rid of the lighters, locked myself in my apartment and warned everyone.

106 days of struggle, sickness, and a return to health.

I still have a long ways to go, but to all of you who are still struggling: a journey of 1000 miles starts with a single step. Every day is a new day, and it's up to you to make it amazing.

If I can do it, you can. Keep up the good work!

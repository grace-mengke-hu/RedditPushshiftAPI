day 4. Quit cigs and caffeine. Feeling so tired

Feeling so tired most of the time. Woke up at 9am, it's now around 11am and i swear I could fall back into a deep sleep. 

If I have a coffee I'll definitely smoke so gonna avoid that major trigger.

I know if I have a cig and coffee I'd feel great, but I'm not going to because I'm really sick of relapsing. 

I've been eating well, drinking water, meditating and nofap, yet I still feel crappy and fatigued. 

Is it really true that if I stick to this for good I'll eventually stop feeling like this?

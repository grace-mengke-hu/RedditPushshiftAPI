Need a bit of support, Anxiety

It's been a few weeks now. I posted a giant post last monday but didn't get any replies. Sorry to be needy but I feel like I need to be needy now.

I've been waking up every morning with churning anxiety, twisting in my stomach. It's only really started at the 7 day mark. I wake up, I open my eyes, and my stomach twists into a knot, and my brain goes 'How can you possibly get out of bed feeling this way? Just give up. Just give the fuck up.'

I really, really hope this is because of the cigarettes, quitting cold turkey, and that it will eventually go away, but it's been happening every morning. The last two times I tried to quit this kept at me, and eventually I snapped, with a big old 'Fuck it, if I have to live life feeling this way, I might as well fucking smoke.'

But I just get out of bed, take a long ass shower, really really long ass shower, and just show up late to work. I feel entitled, needy, and anxious as fuck. I don't really like it. The physical withdrawals are long gone, but I just don't remember feeling like this when I was smoking. And I remember the last time I felt this way, it went away when I started smoking again.

Uh, help, experience, hope?

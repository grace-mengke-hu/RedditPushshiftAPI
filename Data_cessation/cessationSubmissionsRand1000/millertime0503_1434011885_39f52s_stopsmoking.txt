I need to quit quitting.

I've "quit" more times than I can count. The only partially successful one was right after reading Easy Way -- I made it two weeks. But it was at a very emotionally unbalanced time in my life, and I relapsed in depression. I know, quitting smoking can cause depression, and now that I know that I can be prepared for it.

But I'm struggling to get back to the point where that would even be an issue. I throw away the last few of a pack every night, swear I'm done, and by ~3pm the next day I'm standing outside a mini mart puffing away. Okay, well today I'll just cut down, and that will make it easier next time. Heh.

I just moved back in with my parents, and I have to hide it from them. I've lived out of state for a while but they know that I smoke (I still try to hide it anyway), but the whole thing is just unsustainable. I was planning to read Easy Way again tonight, but I want to smoke and drink a little bit while I do it to get my emotional state heightened to absorb the impact of it (hey, that's what worked the first time).

I'm starting to think I might need a crutch. My brother is 60 days clean and said he got through the worst of it with herbal cigarettes. Sensation of smoking etc without the nicotine, and since they taste horrible, you're not as keen on lighting them up. Or should I go fully e-cig and just deal with the nicotine addiction later?

I know the Easy Way, the only way I've been cigarette free for more than a day in 10 years, says crutches and any nicotine replacement is a mistake. But I can't get my brain back into that wonderful "I'm a non-smoker" mindset that I enjoyed for an unfortunately brief period.

Getting to the end of my patch routine

After smoking for 46 years around a pack a day, I stopped 55 days ago using patches. Couple of days time I move to step 3 patches, then 2 weeks after that I am supposed to go patch less. I have noticed some great benefits of quasi quitting, but am scared of having no crutch once the two weeks run out. So, all those who quit using patches, hot did you do it once there was no patch to wear. For info, I tried going patch less the other day - not a good idea, I felt awful! I suppose 46 years is a long time to smoke 20 a day!

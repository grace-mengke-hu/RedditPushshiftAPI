3 years without smoking!

I never thought I would make it but I did!   
I want to thank this community for being here.
I haven't been around much after the first few months but that's what naturally happens, you start to forget about smoking and eventually completely stop thinking about that you quit because it no longer controls you. If you have any doubts don't give up, get the QuitNow! app or something similar and just look at what you've done so far, if I can do it you can do it too!

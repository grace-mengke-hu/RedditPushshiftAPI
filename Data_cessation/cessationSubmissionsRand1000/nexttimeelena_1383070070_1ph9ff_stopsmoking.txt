My body is fighting with my will.

I had an awfull day, I would usually smoke a pack probabbly, but I didn't. This feeling is one of the worst feelings in the world. I try to think about something really awfull everytime my body and mind beg for them. I still talk about it like it is a peron I am addicted to not the useless expensive garbage.

Day Four

Day 4 of absolutely no smoking, today I woke up wanting a cigarette because I woke up thinking of all the bills I had to pay and how little money I would have left over. I almost went to the store and got a pack out of habit. But, I didn't. I would've had less money, felt way more anxious and disappointed. 

To those trying to quit you can do it! I know you guys can. I'm certain this is my last attempt to quitting for the rest of my life. 

If you have anxiety or slightly depressed quit smoking, honestly four days in and I feel much clear headed and not so sad. Weird my eyes even look brighter and more "happier" good luck to everyone! We can do it! :)

Stopped smoking because I got a cold.

I'm a 21 year old female who has tried to quit before. I've had a cold for what seems like 2 years of constant stuffiness and a cough, and lately every time I smoke a cigarette it makes me feel nauseous and hurts my throat. 

On October 30 I get a terrible cold where it has hard to breathe and I just laid in bed for 3 days. 

On the first day I woke up and didn't feel like I wanted one and they were all the way in my car so I didn't feel like getting them so I just decided not to smoke. Then another day went by, still sick and coughing up a lung, so I decided not to smoke.  My cravings were not intense and I honestly only ever get a craving when I am frustrated or angry. Then day 3 came and I was feeling better, took my car to the store to buy soup, and looked at the pack and didn't smoke. It felt like I was just suppressing the time until I finally gave in, but I really want to do it this time. So I finally told my boyfriend and my roommate and they were so proud of me. I never say anything when I start because I don't want to be seen as a failure when I eventually start back up. 

But it's almost been 2 weeks, and after 9 years of smoking I can honestly say I am so proud of myself. 

How can I get a flair? It's been 12 days!

First massive craving

My first craving just hit me and feels as if im going crazy. I didn't give in though, but I just need a way to reduce these cravings so i don't relapse again. My mind has a sneaky way of convincing me that smoking is OK and it wouldn't hurt, imagining famous athletes and celebrities who smokes. I'm a huge sports guy too so seeing someone like Wayne Rooney spark a cigarette is a big fucking trigger for me.

Hope you guys have something. Thanks.

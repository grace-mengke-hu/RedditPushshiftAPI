I month!

Thanks for all of you sharing. I read every post. I have never gone longer than a few days in the past and I really believe that the encouragement here is a big contributor to my success. It just made me keep trying to quit. I failed several times quitting but always learning something which each fail. Until something finally clicked. Iâ€™m done. Smoking is not an option anymore for me. :)

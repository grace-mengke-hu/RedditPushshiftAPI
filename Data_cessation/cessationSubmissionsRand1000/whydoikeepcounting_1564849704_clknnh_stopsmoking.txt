Just completed my third day without smoking. Is it common to feel lethargic?

So, it’s been relatively easy considering I was a pack a day smoker for most of my adult life, but today felt a lot different than day 1 and 2. I could tell I wasn’t as excited as before. I slept in until 10 am, still felt pretty tired. Then in the afternoon, after lunch and fighting off a craving, I ended up taking a 3 hour nap. Woke up still tired and  blasé. Didn’t interact much with the family. Went for a swim in the evening to beat another craving, but still feeling somewhat down. Don’t get me wrong, I’m pumped that I’m not smoking and the cravings aren’t all that bad. The hardest part is reminding myself that I’m not smoking anymore when the though comes up. But I know today has been the hardest so far since I caught myself, more than once, eyeing a half smoked butt left on the floor. Haha!  Gross!

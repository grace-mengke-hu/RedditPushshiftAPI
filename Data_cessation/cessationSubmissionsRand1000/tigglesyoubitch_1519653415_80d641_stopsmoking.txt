I put my new found energy to use. Some excited ramblings ahead....

I'm noticeably developing more energy, I find myself restless quite often now, before when I got restless I'd smoke a cigarette and go back into my comfortable haze. I live with my girlfriend and don't see family and friends too often due to where work has taken me. Therefore I don't want to tell anyone what I'm up to, and just let them see the results of this sweet fucking gym I joined. I feel like a kid, I am so excited about joining. 

So if you want to read ahead, go for it, nothing super exciting, but I did want to share this place with someone. The staff and entire setup is more than a gym, it's a health club which is the size of a 2 floor Walmart or Target. There is a cafe as soon as you enter on the right and a spa/pedi/mani/hair/massage area on the left. Once you're into the locker room, there is a steam/sauna room, 8 bays of 500+ lockers, showers, the whole 9 yards with everything I need to get ready for work except deodorant. Literally everything from body wash to hair driers are provided (including razors which aren't shitty). The back of the locker room exits into the pool area where there is a chilled lap pool, 3 additional warmer pools, two hot tubs, and unisex sauna. Before walking into the locker rooms there are two gymnasiums with basketball courts and a 2 or 3 story rock wall! Upstairs is where all the machines and weights are. In the back corners are different studios. Yoga studio, a room for bicycle classes, a kick boxing room, and two others which I'm not sure what they're for, but probably some other classes I'm unaware of.

Need advice to carry on

Hi ! I just discovered this subreddit and thought that I could ask for a piece of advice.

Background : I am 21, male. I smoked my first cigarette a long time ago and it has been an occasional thing for very long, I did the "only when going out with friends" thing (by the way, if some non smoker reads this : never ever do this, it just gets you accustomed to smoking). But then, one thing leading to another, around may 2013 I started to smoke daily (mainly because of stress/depressing feelings). I stopped about one year later (07/14/2014) with a friend, I was not a really heavy smoker (average between 8 and 10 cigarettes a day).

Now : I am cigarette-free since then. What is my problem ? I still occasionally get the desire to smoke, sometimes more than once a day. It is frightening me, it is not as bad as in the first weeks, but I am afraid one day I will succumb and smoke again. What do you do on such occasion ? Will I ever get completely rid of this ?

Day 1...I hate everyone and everything...

Attempt 2,387...give or take a few...

Already past the stage of hacking up weird, hard shit. Sinuses clearing. The urge to smoke has gotten to the point that I want to punch random people for a cig. 

I had been tapering down and managed to make my last pack last a week. I'm stuck in the mountains of Virginia where they practically still give packs of lucky's in Happy Meals here. 

So splitting headaches and a temper measured in the microseconds are in my immediate future. I suspect I will just skip out of work and head to a bar rather than deal with people in the office. 

Thank god smoking in bars is no longer allowed here. I would be boned.

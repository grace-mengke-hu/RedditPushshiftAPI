20 days- /Pepper/Mint tea helps

Hi dear people. I would like to join you. I have read a lot of posts here. It is inspiring! I'm "free" for twenty days now. The cravings are gone for the last few days, but I expect them any time. You can never trust a craving. Something that might be useful for you- Peppermint tea helped me a lot. Like a new healthy habit. It relaxes me and replaces the psycological need to smoke at certain moments. Wish you luck guys!

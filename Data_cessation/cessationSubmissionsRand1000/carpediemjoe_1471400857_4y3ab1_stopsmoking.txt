5 tools to help you quit

I've smoked a pack a day for 10 years. Been lurking on this forum for a few years now. I am now 2.5 days into my quit and now have zero craving (had plenty the last 60 hours though). Here are some things I've been using. If you are looking for anything that might help consider trying some of these. 

When I got a craving I would:

First: spray this nicotine relief spray under my tongue. It isn't actually nicotine but stuff to help the cravings go away: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00T5SVBQU/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1

Second: breathe in some black pepper essential oil. It helps curb the craving. Here is the oil I use: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PX9L4O4/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1 and this is what I use to inhale it: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TKZD8IC/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1

Third: chew on licorice root sticks (kind of like how people chew gum) these are what I used: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IDP3CO/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1

Fourth: check my status on the smoke free app

Fifth: ask myself the question "are you in pain?" The answer is always no which kind of makes me realize it is all mental

Kill the nicotine monter guys!

The temptation was strong today

Had a long day at work starting with working in a thunderstorm and flash flood. Between being wet and tired, the temptation to light up a smoke was strong since everyone else was smoking away in the elements. I stayed strong and didn't smoke, even though I really wanted to ask someone for even a drag of their smoke.

And so another day goes on smoke free.

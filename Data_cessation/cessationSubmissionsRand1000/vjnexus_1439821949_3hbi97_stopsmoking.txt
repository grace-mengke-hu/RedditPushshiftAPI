Made it through the weekend.

I called you all dicks last week as I got myself off the gum and cut nicotine from my life. It's been 4.5 days since my last nicotine, and I'm doing well. The weekend was a little rough, but I toughed through it.  I kept myself really busy doing whatever tasks I could find around the house, from rust treating steel beams in the basement to caulking some window frames. I hope the chemical is gone from my body now, I haven't had a really bad craving since Sunday morning. Going to keep this up. For me it didn't matter about the nicotine, it was really just about the decision. I choose to not be a smoker. That means I can't have a cigarette even if I want one. I don't smoke.

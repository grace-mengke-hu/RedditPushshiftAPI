8 days and feeling the cravings

It has been 8 days since I smoked last and I feel like I'm about to smoke one. Every time I get this way I keep saying not one more puff. I know it will pass here soon but just want to scream at times. I already feel 100% better than in the past. Proud of myself that I haven't turned to food to stop the cravings.  I know they will go away soon just want one so bad.

Caved after two and a half months

I've smoked since I was 16 but made the choice close to three months ago to quit the smokes at 23. I initially quit last year and lasted about a month, but caved when my grandmother passed away and continued for another 7 months. After quitting again I made some lifestyle changes alongside this change, which included finding a new job and making drastic changes to my diet, but almost three months in, the stresses of juggling school and a new job made me suddenly very apathetic towards the cause. Today my car broke down once again which proved to be the final straw and I walked to 7/11 and bought a pack.

I'm intent on making sure this slight relapse doesn't cause me to fall back into a habit I've worked so hard to kick. I just need someone to give me guidance. Cigarettes have been a vice tied to dealing with my mental health so the struggle is trying to overcome the depressive feelings that compel me to light one up. I'm going to be strong here and I'm trying to tell myself that this isn't square one, but rather a bump in the road.

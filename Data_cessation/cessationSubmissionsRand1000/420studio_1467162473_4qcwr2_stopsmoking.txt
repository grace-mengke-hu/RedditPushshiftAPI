9 Months!!!!

Well it has been a couple months before I even checked to see how long it has been and now I just realized today it has been 9 months! Wow, I really can not believe it. Here are 10 things I have noticed since the quit -

1. Once I hit 4 months smoke free, I had gained 12 pounds from eating.

2. I joined a gym since then and lost 18 pounds in the past 4 months. Holy shit I can run now! 

3. I don't think about cigs really much anymore. I mean it pops up here and there but nothing too bad. It just goes away really quick.

4. Drinking is not even close to being an issue now. This was one thing I wanted to beat from the get go. During the first part of my quit I was on a mission to face as many triggers as I could and drinking was a hard one. But after about the 3rd or 4th time drinking it started becoming easier and easier.

5. Whenever I smell someone that obviously smokes, it is gag worthy.

6. When people smoke cigs around me, it isn't an issue at all. It just smells like poo.

7. I got into the hobby of eating right and nutrition and being overall healthy. I can't believe it took me 25 years to get healthy.

8. This is the best I've ever felt in my life about myself. 

9. I still have anxiety issues. When I quit, for the first 6 or 7 months my anxiety was dormant. Then it popped up again just recently. I hate it.

10. Just the random moments where I still some how think "man, a cig would be nice right now" followed by "no it wouldn't you dumbass"

So for the newly quit people - keep at it. It got so easy. If you're ready to quit, you will. And, you will stay quit. Quitting smoking was the best thing I've ever done in my life.

TL;DR: 9 MONTHS MOTHAFUCKASSSSSSSSSSSS 8=====D~~~~~~~

157 days. Do I have any quit brothers and sisters out there?

I don't come on here much anymore but when I do, I am reminded of the support this place gives people. 

New quitters or potential new quitters, these people on here will help you ALOT. They may not know you but they will be the first to give you positive reinforcement and a kick in the pants too if that is what is needed. Sure helped me. 

Thanks yall!!

5 days Nicotine Free

***I am 31 and Ive been smoking dont stop for 15 years (Newport Menthol)***

I am trying to quit cold turkey as no nicotine product has entered my body in 5 days. Not even blunts. I created my own therapy to quit: 

1-Read and watch youtube videos. It has helped me considerably. Instead of watching the scary black lungs i prefer to see the positive effects of being nicotine free. I also joined this subreddit today because i woke up with cravings. I already found some empowering stories here. I am really proud of you all.

2- Stay away from bad news, especially world news. I used to read 4-5 newspapers before noon and smoked almost half a pack. I know bad news and bad days are inevitable. But the first days try to avoid them so when you habe to face one inevitably you will be stronger.

3- Medical Cannabis. I have a recipe due to anxieties and psychosis and it will NEVER be as delicious as puffing one real cigarette but every time i get anxious at home i smoke some cannabis and it takes the anxiety off.

4 - Eat clean and dirty. Sometime some fruits and vegetables help with the cravings, but also eating a whole pizza makes me stop thinking about smoking.

5 - Breathing. Everytime i fill up my lungs it feels so good. No whistle or obstruction. That helps me go on.


6- Self realization. I will confess i was a disgusting human being: I used to go to the ashtray and take other peoples cigarette-butts when i didnt have money to buy or was too lazy to go to the gas station. After doing so i went to the bathroom and sometimes even cry at what a disgusting person I became. Looking back at this gives me the strenght to continue.

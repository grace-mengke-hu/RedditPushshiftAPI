Screwed up, back to square one... Any advice?

I was 28 days in, cold turkey. But last night, after resisting so many cravings, I was hammered at a bar and bought a smoke. Then I smoked some drags of another...

I've come too far to give up on quitting. Just reset my badge and gonna try damn hard to not let it happen again.

What can I expect though? I'm so hungover I can't really tell if theres any cravings. Am I going to have to go through those 3 hellish days again? Or is it likely that my addiction level had dropped enough that it will just be a minor set back?

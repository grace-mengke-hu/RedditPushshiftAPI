Had to hold my breath when passing a smoker on the street...

I was ducking into a coffee shop for some of their excellent $3 a cup coffee, and standing outside the door was an older, thin, scruffy man sucking on his cigarette in the cold.  Before I could even smell I sucked in my breath and held it.  

Maybe it was the image of the man, who, I'm sure is decent and good, but looked haggard, unkempt, and sickly and represents the future of any of us who keep smoking or maybe it was just the repulsion of cigarettes I've been building up, but I could not bring myself to breath around him at all.

I feel bad for the guy, I do, but all I could think was, thank god I've changed paths....

Day Dos

As of now I've been officially 48 hours smoke free. All my previous attempts were cold turkey attempts, and I have to say with the help of patches and nicotine gum it's definitely a lot easier.

A few good but weird things: I can take much deeper breaths already, but the excess amount of oxygen is making me cough a lot (?). Still, I didn't know I could have so much energy in me. I love walking up and down the stairs without gapping for air (I usually take smokes before going into a building).

I will be making these posts daily whether or not you guys like it or not. Once again, STAY STRONG EVERYONE. EVERYONE IN THIS COMMUNITY BELIEVES IN YOU. REMEMBER, ADDICTION FOR NICOTINE IS ALMOST ON PAR WITH SOME OF THE HARDEST DRUGS OUT THERE. IF YOU'RE ABLE TO QUIT SMOKING, YOU CAN LITERALLY SET YOUR MIND TO DO *ANYTHING* YOU WANT TO DO.

Good luck and see you all tomorrow :)

Had a little meltdown yesterday (but didn't smoke!)

Yesterday was 1 week smoke free.  The day started off nicely, went to the gym, ate healthy foods.  Decided to meet my sister and some friends at the bar.  Limited myself to 2 beers (to avoid the temptation of smoking and I had a long drive home.)  However, between the minimal amount of beer, the bar atmosphere, and the long drive home, I was absolutely dying for a cigarette.  I had to stop to get gas too and just kept thinking how easy it would be to walk in and buy a pack, I kept telling myself "you can start again tomorrow."  I didn't buy any, and I kept chewing my gum the whole way home.  I continued to think, you can smoke when you get home, tomorrow is a new day (my husband smokes, so I knew there would be cigs at home.)  About 20 minutes before I got home I just started crying and cried the rest of the way home.  I am sort of a hard ass, and it takes a lot to make me cry.  When I got home, I turned on the tv and kept myself busy with some computer games until the urges passed.  Today I felt much better and was glad that I didn't give in last night.

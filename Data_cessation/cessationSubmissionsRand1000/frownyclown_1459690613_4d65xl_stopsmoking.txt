Today is my fifth day of no nicotine, I feel pretty good.

My last cig was on the 29th of March, and I stopped cold turkey after that.  I also quit drinking so I haven't had either since then.  It was for the best because I think beer and cigarettes just marry so well.  In any event it hasn't been too bad.  I've kept going to work and then spent this weekend doing some socializing but it was a bit more boring because I didn't want to jeopardize my quit but going out, or hanging out with smokers.

The thing that I guess is so weird is how long it really takes to get over this.  Every thing I've read says at least a month before your lungs even start really cleaning themselves.  I guess it will be like half a year before I'll know if it has affected my ability to run and stuff.

Anyway, started out a smoker and now I'm here.

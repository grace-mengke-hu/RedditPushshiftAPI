Day 3 - I surprised myself today!

I'm 27 and was smoking for 9 years, and tried to quit many times before but failed always.

3 days ago I stopped smoking again with my SO.  

Today I had 5 normal and 3 DRAMATIC cravings. The last dramatic one, damn that was hard as I had one cigarette in my drawer looking at me. I was pretty sure I was going to light that bastard up but all of a sudden I crumbled the pack with the cigarette and threw it in to the garbage! Now I feel really great about it. I think I have the mentality to stop this time.

Good luck everyone WE GOT THIS.

Day 6 (i think) update. Sorry for the terrible writing.

    So first off this place is awesome and has helped. Telling random strangers on the internet about quitting, reading about their journey and the helping/advising each other is great, its because of this place I have gone six days instead of two hours like I have before. Its just I don't want to have to make a post saying I relapsed. So thanks. 
 My short journey has had easy days and difficult ones, but so far so good. I have spent the last 6 days constantly thinking about smoking switching between"i want a cigarette" or "i havent wanted a cigarette all day".( Does this stop ever, or am I going to spend the rest of my life constantly thinking about something I do not want to do.)Also I have started getting this weird antsy type energy, like times when I would smoke I get super energetic and don't know what to do. Last night after work I went from wanting to buy new clothes, to not being hungry and driving up to a taco bell then deciding not to get any, to spending and hour in albertsons. Is this somthing other people experience or am I putting totally unrelated items in the same basket. Concentrating on things has also been harder. The hardest parts have been when I don't get that super bad craving or the headache but when i hear the voice in my head tell me "dude just have a cigarette" in a very chill/relaxed/nonchalant tone. Its easy to say no when my body screams for a cigarette but when it turns into that friend from the anti drug commercial and says "here ya go", it takes a lot to say no because it seemingly comes out of nowhere. People were writing about 1 month around the time real craving kick in? That sucks, my (lying)  grandmother always told me the first three days were the hardest! DAM HER! Just kidding, she is great.     
  **Positives**
  **Breathing better**
  **Sleeping better**
  **Coughing less** 
I am excited. After I feel confident with living smoke free I want to do a Tough Mudder!

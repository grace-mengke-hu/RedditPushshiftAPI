Had 2 puffs of a cigarette last night

I got news last night that was incredibly upsetting and shocking. I saw my friend and grabbed a cigarette from her. I took a couple puffs and then realized what i was doing and threw it down. The issue wasn't solved by those 2 puffs. But it made me realize how slippery this slope is. 

Debating on whether I need to reset my badge or not. 

Anyway . . .yeah.

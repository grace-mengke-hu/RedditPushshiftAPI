NRT - Step 2 (14 mg) It's like starting from scratch

Hey quitters,

So I did 7 weeks on step 1 (21 mg) patch and this week stepped down to step 2 (14 mg) patch. The past 3 days have felt like I've started the quitting process all over again. The cravings are so strong; these cravings aren't knocking at my door, they're fucking bashing on my door. People in this sub are always like, you can do this, you got this, and it seems so simple to tell myself I can do this. However, I'm not sure how much longer I can keep this up. Tomorrow I have a huge meeting with my boss regarding yearly reviews and I am shitting bricks about it. Normally this meeting is a walk in the park. Help!

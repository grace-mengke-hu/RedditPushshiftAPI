Weird

Im 15 years old 182cm 75kg healthy just some liver issues nothing big but i smoked my second cigarette (no problem inhaling since i smoke weed with tobaco for 2 years) I was feeling sick again after this like first time 2 days ago like headache and realy weird walking like losing coordination for 10minutes

PS: I know i shoudlnt be smoking cigs and i dont think feeling like this after cig is bad since it keeps me away of them and not realy craving of them

A relapser checking in.. struggling to give it another go

Greetings all. 

I used this sub and Allen Carr's book to quit about 3 years ago. It was a struggle, as everyone knows, but I stayed smoke free for 1.5 years. 

Then, I found out my wife, who had quit smoking with me, had started back up. This led to me having a drag of hers, then a quarter smoke, and now, 1.5 years later, I'm back where I started at 20 a day. 

We've since divorced, and my current partner does not smoke. My job is far less stressful, and that feeling of "hating smoking" seems to be growing. 

I read Allen's book again, but didn't make it 4 hours without  smoke after finishing it. I'm starting to wonder if this sub helped me more than his advice. 

I don't know what I'm looking for by posting this, but I have one cigarette left in my pack, and I'm on the fence about buying another one, or if I should just deal with it, and stop right now. Of course I know the answer to this, but if that was enough, I wouldn't be posting.

Thanks for listening.

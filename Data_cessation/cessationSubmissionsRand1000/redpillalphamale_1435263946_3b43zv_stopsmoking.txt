When did your withdrawal symptoms and craving for a cigarette go away? How long until you didn't think about a cigarette during the day?

I'm just a bit more than 1 week quit and I still have some desire for smoking sometimes but not very strong. However I still feel a bit off which I think is a symptom of withdrawal and my dreams are very vivid still. I tend to think about cigarettes a solid 30 minutes a day if not more. (I mean a few minutes at a time for an amount totalling 30 minutes). 

I guess my question is for long time quitters. I know everyone is different but I'd like to hear peoples experiences.

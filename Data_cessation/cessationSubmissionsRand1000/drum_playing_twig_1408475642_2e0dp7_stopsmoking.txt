All my gamer friends smoke. Help...

I quit a while back. Haven't played any games during summer so I've avoided my smoking gamer friends.

But now I sit in voice chat with them and all of them smoke. I get such a nostalgic feeling when all of them go out for a smoke after a game of Dota. I remember playing a hectic game, getting a bit stressed and adrenalin rushed then calming down with a smoke after.

I know it's been more than 80 days but I feel evil demons resurfacing. How can I enjoy this shit without a smoke?

Struggling with cravings at 2 months

Tomorrow will be two months since my last cigarette. Most days I don’t even think about it, but sometimes I just want to go back, just once.

Whenever someone smokes on the street, I may envy them, in a weird way. Also, people at parties who “smoke when they drink”. Anxiety adds to it, be it a party or stress from work, or a depressive episode. I recently cut drinking as well, being sober helps, but sometimes I just want to eat a thick burrito, and down a six pack and a half accompanied by cigarettes. Maybe with some bad company. Sometimes.

I’m glad I dragged my ass to the gym earlier tonight and am too tired now to walk to the shop. Not another puff, at least not tonight, you sneaky motherfucker.

How do you guys deal with these passing cravings?

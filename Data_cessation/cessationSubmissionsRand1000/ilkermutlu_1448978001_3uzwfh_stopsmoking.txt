Well into day 4

Glad to have found this subreddit. 

I've been smoking ~30 for ~15 years. I've tried to quit 2 times before, they both went down the drain after 4 months. TBH, I was never wanting to quit at those times.

Really determined now. I'm well into the 4th day, nothing further than a few minor pangs until now. I'm trying not to make too big of a deal out of the whole thing. I'm trying to embrace what's coming and enjoy it.

Came to say hi. So yeah, hi all smoke free people :)

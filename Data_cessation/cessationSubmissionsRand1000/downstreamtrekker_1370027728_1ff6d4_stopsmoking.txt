A few thoughts on my 19 days

19 days in and not one single puff. I think this was my downfall the first two times I tried quitting; I was one of those who thought "Oh, it's only a couple puffs, it doesn't count." It does count. The moment you take that drag, you go from non-smoker back to smoker again. Sure, it might not happen overnight, but you're going back.

This time, I'm following the "not one puff" mantra and it's working great. I feel better than I have in a dozen years. Also, I must note, both the "3-day hump" and the "2-week hump" are very real things. Since I passed the 14 day mark, it has become almost easy. I can hang out with smokers for hours and not even get more than one or two light, easy-to-manage cravings.

The fact that I can smell things again for the first time in 12 years is astonishing. Walking home on a rainy night a few days ago, I stopped three times on a four-block walk to smell plants that I hadn't smelled in years. One other oddity is that I no longer like green beans. Used to be one of my favorite vegetables; I've tried to eat them twice since I quit smoking and I now do not like them. Weird!

At any rate, I know this was just a bunch of random thoughts, but hooray for not smoking! Have a great day everybody. :)

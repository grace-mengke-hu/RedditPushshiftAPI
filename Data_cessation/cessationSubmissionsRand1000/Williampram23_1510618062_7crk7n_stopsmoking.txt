Almost bought a pack, but convinced myself not to.

It is day 4 now smoke free, and it's getting to my head a little. I can't think, I can't stay concentrated on my task, and i feel awful. Just now I was walking to the shop to go buy a pack, but I stopped in front of the shop and started weighing the pros and cons. I didn't do it, but I was damn close. 

So, here's something I've learned. When you have a craving, take a deep breath in and out. Now, you tell yourself how easy that was after quitting.

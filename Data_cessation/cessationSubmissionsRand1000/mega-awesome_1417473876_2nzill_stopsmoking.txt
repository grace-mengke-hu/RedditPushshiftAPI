Waiting... Craving....

I'm waiting for a friend to meet up with me. The simple act of sitting here waiting is making me feel like I should do something productive with my time.... Like go for a smoke or two before she gets here.

But I'm a non smoker now so instead I'm using this time to tell Ya all how I'm overcoming this craving.

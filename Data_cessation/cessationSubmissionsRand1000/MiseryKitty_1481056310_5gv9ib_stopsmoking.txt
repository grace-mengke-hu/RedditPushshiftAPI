10 days feels fantastic.

I've quit before and know that it gets easier. Last time, I quit for 6 months. 

It just feels so good to have my throat clearing up and I don't reek like cigarettes! It has to be one of the best feelings to be able to go anywhere without being worried about smelling like a cheap motel.

I'm getting headaches and I'm getting hungrier but I gotta keep going. I'm gonna come up on two weeks!

This place has really helped. Thank you.

BEEN HERE BEFORE

Hi everyone, it's not my first visit on here, must be my 3rd time now! First time I did well, got to around 21 days using patches and nrt, slipped up on a girls night out!!!! Second time used ecig, 21days ish, but couldnt get on with it, it kept leaking and the coils kept burning out making me cough so ended up caving in again.

I promised myself when I was 30 I would stop, I'll be 32 in August.

So I randomly smoked my last cigarette yesterday morning and I havent touched 1 again, YET.

I'm getting such bad mood swings, and it seems my family are really really annoying me! I've had no patience with my kids at all and my husband is really getting on my nerves. I just have absolutely no patience.
I've been fine all day on my own and the second they all get in I just feel my stress levels go through the roof! I feel I could quit alot easier if I just had some space?
I know it's just the cold Turkey talking but I dont want to be mean to them I just cant help it!

Anyway thanks for having me back again, let's hope I can kick this shit!

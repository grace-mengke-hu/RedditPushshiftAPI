Day 20 complete

20 days have gone by, and they have gone by pretty quickly. I am so glad to have stuck with it, otherwise I would still have been browsing this sub thinking i will quit tomorrow. No health benefits yet, but I saved a ton of money. I posted here daily from Day 1 to 10, then every two days from Day 11 to 20. Now, I will post here once every third day. This system is working for me, so why mess with it. :) Thanks for reading.

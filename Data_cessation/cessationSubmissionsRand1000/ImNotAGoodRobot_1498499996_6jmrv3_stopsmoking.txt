50 days ðŸ™ŒðŸ’ª

I just want to say that I remember the first weeks. I was on the edge. Every hour counted. My mind highly rarefied and bruised. I just wanted to quit. No matter what. ( even if you get fat? Even if you stop gooing to work? My mind kept asking. I said yes Yeees!) i still say yes to all those questions. Cause it's a treasure to be a non smoker again. A treasure you find very soon after you don't smoke. And  i should say I still have my job and I'm not obese(yet).  And because I've been a quitter for so many years, I remember people writing nope at the end of their posts. I think it was 2010, when I was 23 and I tried to quit for the first time. So
NOT ONE PUFF EVER (NOPE) ðŸ˜€

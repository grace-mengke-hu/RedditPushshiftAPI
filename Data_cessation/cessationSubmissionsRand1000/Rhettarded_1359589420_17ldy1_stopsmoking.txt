Just curious guys, what (if any) NRT have worked/not worked for you?

I have tried patches (made my skin red and itchy), tried the lozenges (Made my throat really sore), tried the gum (makes me nauseous) and tried an inhaler, the inhaler is the only thing that worked for me, but it still made me feel a little bit sick. 

So yeah just curious what worked for you?

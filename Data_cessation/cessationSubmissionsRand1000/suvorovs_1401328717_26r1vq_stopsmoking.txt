This Great Band of Quitters

2 weeks. I really didn't think I could quit. I thought I was going to have a shitty lung for the rest of my life, and live my life wondering how others can live their lives without smoking. Even lung surgery from lung collapse 2 years earlier couldnt get me to quit. But this subreddit, with all the supporters/fellow quitters, all offering encouragement and sympathy has been a vital life support to me once the nicotine was cut off. 
Let's keep up the good work and make sure nobody gets left behind.

also read allen carr, he puts logic into the illogical nature of nicotine addiction.

Do others get angry without reason?

I'm not sure if it's still the quit that's doing this or something else but on quite a few days - like today - I wake angry and then I just stay angry and I have absolutely nothing to be angry about, I just feel like screaming and smashing everything and then maybe beating someone to a pulp. 

I got up, was angry, tried to work out what I'm angry about and came up with nothing. So I took some deep breaths, did a 45-minute meditation, had a shower - still angry - go out for a bike ride, pump the peddles for 45 minutes, still angry. Try having lunch. Still angry. And it's like....rage.....like I can't concentrate because I'm *so* angry.

This is confusing. Pretty sure this is a 'since I quit smoking' thing too. Is this a common thing others experience? It's just that when other quitters talk about anger they seem to be talking about overreacting to things that are actually kinda frustrating/shouting at other people etc. I literally have nothing to be angry about so I haven't been moody with other people or anything, I'm just suffering on the inside! Hope I calm down soon because this is so uncomfortable and absolutely nothing seems to be working: not the meditation, exercise, breathing exercises. Nothing.

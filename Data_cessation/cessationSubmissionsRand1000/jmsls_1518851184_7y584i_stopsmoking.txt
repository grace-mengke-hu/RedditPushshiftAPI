One week smoke free!

Allen Carr was right, after five days the cravings do become a lot less frequent. I've got the smoker's flu right now which sucks, but with a lot of water it'll be alright, and it's a nice reason to take a long warm shower. Good luck to everyone and keep going, great that you're improving yourself!

Going back to my university for senior week and graduation- aka party week and more parties- many of my friends smoke. Tips for not smoking while there?

Graduated early and am now coming back for a week of basically non stop partying.  It's the kind of week where old me would easily convince herself that "just one to celebrate!"  Or any of the other 1000 BS reasons to smoke I can fabricate.  Tips for getting through the week?

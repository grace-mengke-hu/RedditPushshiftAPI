Sick and tired of being Sick and tired

To us humans, the worst pain to feel is to feel trapped, and burdened. It is not something you can runaway from, it is not something you can seclude yourself from. It is not something you can shut off in your life.

In fact, it is nothing at all. This materialistic world has no say in it, for it is our minds which is the burden.
It is our mind in which our innocent self is trapped. 
Desires, Cravings, Lust.. all these things shroud our true selves.

And in time when we lose sight of our true selves, we start killing it. For its beautiful value falls blind to our eyes. 

And so we smoke, and with the smoke goes away our beautiful years. Become in tune with who you were before killing yourself.
Seek that which is eternal.

The worst form of suicide is that which is done throughout a lifetime.

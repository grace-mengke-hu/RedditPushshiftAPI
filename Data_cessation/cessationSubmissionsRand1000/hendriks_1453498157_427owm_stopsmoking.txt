Just stopping by to say hello, and to tell you to keep it up !

It's been a year-and-a-half since I last used nicotine. It was a bit challenging at first, but got easier real fast. Now months go by without even thinking about smoking. I'm scrambling right now to come up with reasons why I thought it was so hard to stop. I read my old posts here, and that helps bring it back. It was hard, and posting here really did help.

Anyway: 552 days * 30 cigarettes = 16,560 cigarettes not smoked, at an average price of $10 a pack of 20 that's **$8,280 saved**. Woowza, drinks are on me tonight!

And now here's the real kicker: at 3 minutes per cigarette (I was a real fast smoker) that's 49,950 minutes (832 hours, or 21 full 8-hour day work weeks) time for something else, like my family, friends, hobbies, and work. **21 full work weeks saved!**

Now about about the **health improvements**: I feel so much better now, and I got rid of frequent colds and stomach pains at night. These had been nagging me for years, and I didn't even think it was caused by my (excessive) smoking.

No concentration problems, no cravings, no problems with smokers near me, no problems while drinking alcohol, no regrets. **Totally. Worth. It.**

Stay the course everyone! If I can do it, you have a pretty good chance of doing it as well.

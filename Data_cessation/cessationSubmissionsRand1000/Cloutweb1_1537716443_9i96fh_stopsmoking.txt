Staring at the eyes of the devil

Im 10 days nicotine free and yesterday I had two tests:

1- I visited my sister-in-law, Adri,  whom I dont get to see that much because of the distance. We were all going to hang out and my girlfriend took a shower in her house. I sat with Adri to catch up. She is a chain smoker; Marlboro Gold (Light 100). Total crap i hated the taste of those but back when I was a smoker i couldn't care less and I would smoke a whole pack if it was there for the taking. I spoke with her about me quitting. Not in a preachy way but in a reliefy way. She was really happy about it and when she heard it she wanted to move away from where i was sitting and I told her that I wanted to test me and that I still get cravings but now I am the one doing the talking. We spent like 1.5 hours chatting and she lit like 3-5 Marlboros. I didnt even take one hit.

2- I went yo hang out with my girlfriend, her sister and her mother. We went to this awesome intellectual-vibe pub. Everybody was having a great time. Puerto Rico's tobbaco law is not enforced at all, so you get to smoke almost everywhere. 30-35 people were outside , 10-12 were smoking. I drank 3 Coronas and 3 Grand Marnier shots. Call me a pussy but i was tipsy already. In the past I would've smoked like crazy. I didnt even take one puff. I had the craving but it felt like when you have a craving to eat some ice cream or to buy some tennis shoes.


So I hanged out with smokers,  had some drinks and I did if without getting dirty.

One thousand.

Hey all,

Today marks the milestone of 1000 days of taking control. I'd say 90-95% of any hard work was done within the first 3 weeks, and most of that in the first few days. Once you form a new habit, of NOT smoking, then that habit is just as easy to ride as any other. 

You are all masters of your own choices. I invite you to choose the long term reward over a short term counterfeit satisfaction.

Edit: Please ask any questions you have about techniques I used or how I dealt with life and the addiction, I will endeavor to answer them. Or just rant at me about how shit the situation can be, and I'll be here to agree with you.

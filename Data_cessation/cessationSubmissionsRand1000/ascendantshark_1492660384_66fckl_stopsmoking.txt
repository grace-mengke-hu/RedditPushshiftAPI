Stubborn skin issue finally healing, also more mentally stable

I had a tiny cut on the tip of my finger right near the nail, and it would never heal, no matter how much lotion or liquid bandage I used. I stop smoking for a bit and the thing starts healing. It's now basically healed completely. 

From a mental standpoint I am noticing how much more control I have now. Things that made me mad or irritated don't bother me any more. Could be a pink cloud, but it feels much better compared to when I was smoking not that long ago.

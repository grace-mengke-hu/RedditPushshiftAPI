Play the tape forward

Someone in the stopdrinking sub said this and I thought it was a great tip for stopping smoking.

When you crave that one cigarette, play the tape forward. Play the track forward.  You know where it's going. It always plays out the same. 1, 2, 10, 1000 ...

Not sweating smoking lately but think it might come in handy for someone.

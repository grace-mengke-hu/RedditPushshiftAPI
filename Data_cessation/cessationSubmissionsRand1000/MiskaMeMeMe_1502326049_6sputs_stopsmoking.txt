Are you starting to doubt yourself? Starting to wonder if it is all worth it?

Allow me to assure you it abso-fuckin'-lutely is. It has been a few years since I made the decision (and not for the first time) to quit smoking. But armed with Alan Carr's voice in my ear this time I made it. But it is not easy. Let's not pretend.

But it is far more difficult to continue to smoke. To continue to always be thinking about the next cigarette. To always make sure you have a pack handy. To smell.

If you've gone a few days and are thinking, 'eh, I'll try again in a few weeks . . .," resist that urge! Every urge defeated is stronger than the next one. And the next one. It gets easier and easier and soon you'll be mad at yourself for ever smoking in the first place.

You can do this. This community, your friends and family, we're all supporting you.

Bear down. Have a stick of gum. Think of your happy place. But don't go back. Don't ever go back. You'll be thankful in a month, a year, a decade that you didn't.

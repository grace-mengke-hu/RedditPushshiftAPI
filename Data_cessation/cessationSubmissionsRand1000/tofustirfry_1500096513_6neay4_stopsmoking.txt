Day 3: No Smokes - No Drinks

Just checking in - had a hour long craving today so headed out and did some errands. Fucking nicotine is being a little bitch about leaving my body by kicking and screaming on its way out. Smoking will be harder to quit in the short term and drinking will be harder to quit in the long term but heres to the end of day 3 with none of either.

Summer Cravings?

Summer is pretty much here, so I wanted to ask you all how you deal with cravings when out in the sun!

I know that this season is a big trigger for me, especially as I'd usually have a beer in one hand and a cigarette in the other!

So what would you suggest for the empty hand? Another beer? Lol

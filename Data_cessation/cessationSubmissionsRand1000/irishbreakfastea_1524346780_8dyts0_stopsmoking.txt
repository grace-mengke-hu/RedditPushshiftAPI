Fell off the wagon for a second, but getting right back on

Well after 10 days of being smoke free I cracked under an emotional situation and had three smokes on Wednesday.  Bought a pack Thursday, smoked all of it, and bought another pack yesterday.  I even drank alcohol, which I don't want in my life anymore.  Pissed about that slip up as well. 

So here I am.  Threw the last of my cigarettes down the toilet this  morning.  I have my nicotine gum.  The way I see it I haven't smoked for 10 of the last 13 days, which is pretty damn good.   But I don't want to smoke again at all!  I felt sucked right back in, one simply wasn't enough.  So I need to stop now before I do any more damage.  I'm hoping the withdrawal won't be too bad since I smoked for a few days only.

In any case, no matter how bad it is, I will not smoke.  The gum helps.  Thanks for all the support guys.  Don't give up

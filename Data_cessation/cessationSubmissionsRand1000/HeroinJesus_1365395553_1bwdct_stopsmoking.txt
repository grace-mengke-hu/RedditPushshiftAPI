Smoking While Driving

Ok, so i've tried quitting many a time, and it usually never lasts, one of the big things is that i've gotten so used to smoking while driving that the urge hit's like twice as hard whenever i have to go anywhere. Has anyone had this problem/know of any way to counter it, would definatley appreciate the help

Edit: Thanks for all the responses guys, this is actually the first time i've ever been on this subreddit, it seems super supportive and awesome. I guess because my parents/friends don't smoke i've never been able to have a support group for this, and i think it might help out a lot, thanks!

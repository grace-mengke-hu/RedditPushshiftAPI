In the past 800 days...

I've gone though a lot. 

Some highlights/lowlights:

* Worked two jobs 6 days a week for two years
* Lost friends, gained friends
* Career change for the better (dream job)
* Bought a [Harley](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/2766bw/bought_this_with_the_money_ive_saved_for_574_days/)
* Broke up with my girlfriend of 5 years
* Car broke down
* Couldn't get a loan to fix it
* Met an amazing woman but taking it slow
* Motorcycles don't ride well in Colorado during the winter

Long story short, these past 800 days have been absolutely crazy! Good and bad. But you know what? That's life. It's a ride. I'm enjoying every minute of it.

But the best part of the past 800 days was on November 5th 2012, the day I stopped smoking. It may sound lame to some of you, but it's true. Best decision I've ever made. 

Here's to all you quitters,

Cheers!

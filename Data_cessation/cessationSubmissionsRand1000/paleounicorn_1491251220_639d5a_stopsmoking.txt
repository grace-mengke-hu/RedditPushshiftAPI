Smoker friends

I'm 5 days smoke free and I'm hanging out with a good friend tonight, usually what we do is smoke, drink coffee and talk. I moved the hang out to a coffee shop so I wouldn't be outside much, but I'm already craving and thinking about how easy it would to just to bum one and then go on with my quit. I know, I know it's never just one. Anyone have any experience with this, or have any help and advice?

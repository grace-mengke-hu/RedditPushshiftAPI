Oh apparently it's my 'cake day'

I just posted a message and was extremely confused by the fact that there was what appeared to be a piece of cake, in brackets, next to my username.

Apparently it's the anniversary of when I joined reddit.

Meaning a year ago today I started my last quit attempt. 

I've just realised that between this quit and the last attempt, I've actually spent about 6 out of the last 12 months NOT smoking. That makes me feel good :)

I am going to be done tomorrow and will start a new chapter in my life. I need to stop wasting my money and time.

I have been smoking for more years of my life than not and I'm ready to make a new start.  I have tried many times in the past and I am not allowing myself to view these attempts at failures.   Each time was just a practice round that is preparing me to be successful this time.  Thinking about doing a C25K as an extra challenge cause I'm not going to want a ciggy with my lungs burning from a run.

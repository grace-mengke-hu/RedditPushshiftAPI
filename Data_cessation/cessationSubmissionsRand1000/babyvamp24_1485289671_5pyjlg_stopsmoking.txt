Interesting comment at job interview

I had an interview today for a school job that I really want. I was really surprised to be told that the last few people had smelt of smoke, so automatically wouldn't have got the job. I was pretty proud in that moment that all I smelt of was perfume and shampoo! Day 5 is coming to an end, feeling good :)

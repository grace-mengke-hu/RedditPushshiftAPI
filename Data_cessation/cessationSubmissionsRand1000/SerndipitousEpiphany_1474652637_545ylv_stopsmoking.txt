Food tastes better than ever!

I've heard that one's sense of smell and taste improve after quitting smoking. But honestly, I didn't expect the difference to be so noticeable. I love coffee and there's a smell (kinda nutty/popcorny) that I never noticed before. I ate a restaurant where the food is usually so-so and I swear it tasted better than ever. Has anyone else noticed such a marked improvement as well?

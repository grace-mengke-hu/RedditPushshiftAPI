Day 2!

I started smoking properly last February due to depression. I think I might be ready to come off my medication soon, so I shouldn't need these stupid cigarettes any more, right?

I want to go back to how I was before, with just having 1 or 2 every few weeks when I'm out drinking. No more trips to the garage, or standing around in the rain for me! 

Wish me luck :)

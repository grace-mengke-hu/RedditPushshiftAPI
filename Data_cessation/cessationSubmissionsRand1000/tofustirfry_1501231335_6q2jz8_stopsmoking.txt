Day 16: 1 mile run, Leg/Ab day lift, No smokes, No drinks

Hour and thirty left in the day and almost missed my check in! Just finished my leg day lift and enjoy a stew dinner. Woke up again and just started running so I could get in the one mile run:-) not bragging, but today was easy - no cravings of either addiction - I know it won't always be this way so I'll just enjoy it while it last.

I'm going to add another improvement to myself. Tomorrow morning - no more snoozing. I'm a horrible snoozer who can hit the alarm 10 times before waking. From now on, I don't care if I wake and browse reddit for 10-20 minutes but I will not go back to sleep. It was a habit that got worse when my drinking got worse. I'd wake feeling like shit as the world spun around and I'd tell myself another thirty minutes might make me better.  Fuck that. It never did and I ended up just wasting the day. Starting tomorrow - I will wake to my alarm regardless of being tired or not ready and go for a run!

Anyone else run or lift today? Either way, I will not drink or smoke with you all:-)

Night night

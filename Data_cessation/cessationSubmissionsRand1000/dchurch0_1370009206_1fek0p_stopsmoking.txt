I didn't buy smokes this morning

Today is the first day in a LOOONG time that I didn't buy smokes on the way to work. I stopped and got a couple of energy drinks, but did not get any smokes.

I had one left in the pack this morning and smoked it after I got back from my daily walk. Then, when I was in the shower, I made the decision not to buy any more today.

We'll see how the rest of the day goes. I'm just tired of thinking about smoking, about quitting smoking, and worrying about it. I'm ready to be done with it all.

Bring on the cravings and all the other bullshit. I'll get thru this and get it out of my system, and then in a few days I'll look back and laugh at how stupid I've been for the past three years.

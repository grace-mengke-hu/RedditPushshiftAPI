Checking in at 3 years.

I'm happy to report that I haven't had a cigarette in over 3 years now. I has definitely gotten easier. Hopefully I can be of some inspiration for those who are struggling with it. If you are having a hard time quitting, just keep at it. Every day you try to quit is one day closer to the day you finally do.

Just wanted to stop in and say hello.

At this point I'm not even sure how many days I've been a non-smoker. It's been at least three months, but possibly as long as six months ago. 

I smoked from 16 years old to 21 years old. Quit for a year. Started again after taking a puff of a friends cigarette. Smoked for another two years. Quit every now and again from then on until however long ago. 

I just wanted to let everyone know starting out, that you CAN do this.

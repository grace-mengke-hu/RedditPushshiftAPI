Question about Cigar/quit date.

I asked my girlfriend to Merry me on Saturday and I had  a Cigar on Sunday to celebrate. I was 33 days smoke free up to that point and I haven't had a smoke or the craving to smoke since... Can I keep my quit date and call this a celebratory cigar... or should I start back at 1. Either way I will continue on... I was just curious.

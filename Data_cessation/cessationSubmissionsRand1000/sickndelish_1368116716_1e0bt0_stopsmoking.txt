Two Months Smoke Free!!!

I smoked my last cigarette on March 9th in the late morning. I remember it tasting awful, and it hurt to inhale; my lungs were still squeaky like they always were in the morning. But most of all I remember the anxiety I felt about quitting. It seemed unthinkable to live life without cigarettes. Well, I'm happy to report that life is so much easier without them. It was really difficult at times, but I just kept telling myself that I couldn't be trusted to think my way out of smoking. I simply had to wait it out. If I tried to think too hard I could end up rationalizing a cigarette. For the last few weeks its been a slice of cake. 

In a lot of ways, I can't believe it's been only two months. Within a week, I began jogging at the gym. After a few weeks I started cycling and joined a boxing gym. I was able to survive finals week with zero issues, wrapped up the semester with a 4.0. Now I'm preparing to leave next Saturday on a solo bicycling trip from Phoenix, AZ to St. Augustine, FL. 

I know I'm not out of the weeds yet. I once quit for 8 months and then deliberately started smoking again because I felt down. However, this is the longest I've made it since then, and it took me 5 years to get back here, so I really want to keep it going. I don't ever want to smoke again. I smell better, have more energy, whiter teeth, more money, more freedom, more self-respect, more time, etc. Anyone can do it! Free yourself!

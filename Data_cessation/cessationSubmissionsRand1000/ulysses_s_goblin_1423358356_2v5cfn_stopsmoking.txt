Tonight is going to be a big test

Tonight is the first night I'm really drinking since I've quit. I did a dry January, and really haven't had an occasion to have more than a beer since February began. It's my best girlfriend's birthday tonight, and a bunch of us are going laser-tagging, then out to the bars. It was 40 degrees in Chicago today, so it's going to be a beautiful night and no excuse not to go out for a cig, besides, of course, that I've quit! Although I feel firm in my commitment to being a non-smoker, the sub-arctic temps here in the midwest have made it preeeetty easy to not want to go outside. 

So, here it goes. Off to drink a million beers and run around all night. I'm not going to smoke. 

I'm not going to smoke.

UPDATE: I didn't smoke! And after more than my fair share of gin, I feel great!

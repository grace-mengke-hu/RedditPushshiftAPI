Recommendations after quitting weed.

for the guys who smoked weed with cigarettes, how much did you abstain from weed until you decided to cut also the cigarettes?

i managed to keep 36 hours smoke free from both, but the withdrawals was so hard i couldn't do it.

one thing for sure, i don't gonna back to smoke weed, when do you think from your experience i should cut off the cigarettes ? 

for the record, i really hate smoking i only do it cause i'm addicted to nicotine, i wish i could quit both at same time but seems i can't do it... you think 10 days is enough? ( was occasional smoker of weed)

My one month is in a few days, just a quick question.

Ignore my badge, I haven't updated it yet (currently set at 114 days but I relapsed.)

My one month mark is coming up in a few days and I'm beyond pumped up, because this is the longest I've gone without a cigarette in 8 years and I'm only 23 years old. 

Lately I've been getting into running and I have a quick question. I was never really in shape before so I was expecting some huff and puff on my runs, funny thing is my mile time, and amount of coughing isn't that much different from when I smoked. I know this can be attributed to me being out of shape, but I did occasional running when I smoked a pack a day. So ex-smoking runners: How long did it take for your breathing to get better during physical activity? For reference, I'm 6'2" and 195lb (mostly chub though.)

TL;DR: Ex-smoking runners: How long did it take for your breathing to get better during physical activity?

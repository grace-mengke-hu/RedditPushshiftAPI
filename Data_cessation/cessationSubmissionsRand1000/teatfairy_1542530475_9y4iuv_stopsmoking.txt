Checking in!!

Still not smoking! Its kind of shocking sometimes because I did it for so long. I'm getting used to not going outside with people or joining the group smoke sessions. It kinda makes me feel isolated but I am hoping that feeling will continue to fade. 

Anyway, I hope you guys are still at it!! ðŸ˜…

day one

Had my last cigarette this morning (about 9 hours ago).. Have been smoking about 10-15 a day for the past 5 years. I am 46 now with two kids and I want to be there for them. I also want the monkey off my back - amazing how much thought and attention you need to maintain smoking.. hunting for moments to catch a smoke, hiding it from people, making trips to the store.. not to mention the cost and the health risks and guilt etc.. I can't believe I'm here again (I quit before and lasted 10 years). Deep breath.. here we go. Been having cravings big time today but hanging in there and keeping myself occupied. Took a nice long walk by the river which was great!

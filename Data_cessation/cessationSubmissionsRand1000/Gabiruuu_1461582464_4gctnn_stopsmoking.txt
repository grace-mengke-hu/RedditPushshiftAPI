5 months, one trip to Greece, and 6kg!

Five months without smoking here. 😉 Never thought I would manage it. Recently, some friends started to ask me advices and I'm starting to fell the responsibility of being a role model! My advice, don't smoke! And Allen Carr's book helped me a lot. 😊

Anyway, with the saved money I was able to buy a trip to Greece for two this summer. My boyfriend, that has never smoke, is really happy with it. The new goal, buy a trip to Asia in 2017 with cigarettes money. If I don't smoke I am able to save the necessary amount for that! Amazing how much you can save!

The only thing I'm worried with is the 6kg I've gained... Have been going to gym 4/5 times a week, eating healthy (most of the time 😁) and not eating more than I used to when I was a smoker. In fact, I am eating better quality, about the same quantity and doing more exercise than when I used to smoke. I notice that I'm much more muscular, feeling great, but afraid with the weight gain. Did this also happened to you? Is the weight gain a reaction from my body for the smoke quitting? Or is it really me eating more than I used to without realizing it?

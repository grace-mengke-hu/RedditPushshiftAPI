3rd Day PURE RAGE AND HATRED

When I told someone how hard it was to quit, she replied, "It's your fault for smoking in the first place."

WTF YOU BASTARD, NO SHIT, BUT IS THAT GONNA HELP ME WITH QUITTING? WTF IS YOUR PROBLEM!

and honestly I know the withdrawal is making me angrier than I should be, but it just won't listen to reason. 

anyone else on the 3rd day of quitting and feeling pure rage and urges to break things and curse at the top of your lungs?

How do you deal with these mood swings.

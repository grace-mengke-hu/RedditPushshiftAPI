Dreamed of smoking

Had my first dream of me smoking in it last night.  I knew they would come.  I actually woke up mid inhale and laughed at myself.  I literally felt my face/lips making doing the inhale routine.  
Also, I use to smoke while shaving in the morning- that was one of my worse times for a craving.  I no longer get them while shaving.

Reward systems

It's been a while since I last checked in. I have now been a non-smoker for one month, five days, and 20 hours. I just ran 1.5 miles Saturday and biked 15 miles a couple of days before that. I'm making considerable progress in my cardiovascular endurance. Thanks to all of you for your supportive responses to my previous posts. You've really helped me.

Now on to my question: what kinds of reward systems have you set up for yourselves? I'm thinking of putting aside $5 a day (about a third of what I spent on cigarettes) and treating myself to a sporting goods shopping spree every month or so.

I made it through my weekend in Vegas

Just wanted to share a small success story with with you all. I posted last Friday during a weekend in Vegas about how I was struggling, and how I was telling myself "one on a weekend away won't hurt".

Anyway I stayed strong and resisted. This is a big hurdle for me.

Also big thanks to u/empty_the_cup, u/Timeisnow1 & u/Armison for their messages of positivity and support in my time of need. It's really appreciated.

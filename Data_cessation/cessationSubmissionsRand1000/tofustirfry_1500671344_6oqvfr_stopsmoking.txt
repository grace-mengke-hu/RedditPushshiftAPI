Day 10: No smokes, No Drinks, Yes Workout

Double digits surround me as I enter into the weekend more determined and freed from addiction! Got my 2nd day of workouts in yesterday for a bicep/shoulder/ab day and today will be legs/abs! If anyone used to weight lift in any capacity and is wanting to get back into it - I bought the Powerblocks (90lb set) and adjustable bench (~ $500) off amazon and can do mostly every single workout I used to do at my gym - right in my garage. I know it is a bit of an initial cost (maybe cheaper if can find used on craigslist) but from all the money we save from not smoking, it is very much worth imo. If you would want my workout sheet I use to track my numbers/workouts, just comment and ill share my google sheet. 

Anyways, life is good and onwards to health, strength and tackling this amazing life. Enjoy the weekend everyone!

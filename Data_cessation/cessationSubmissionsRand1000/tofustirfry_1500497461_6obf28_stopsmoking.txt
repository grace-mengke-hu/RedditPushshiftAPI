Day 8: No smokes, No drinks

Barreled past Day 7 and into day 8! Went for a nice night run the past two nights - we picked beautiful smelling flowers along the way - yesterday I smelled the neighbor grilling steak - the smell of dusk as children can be heard playing in the neighborhood - not hearing "you smell like a brewery" every single morning while you lay next to the person you love. Shaving my beard regularly because it held onto my smoke and beer smell too well. Smelling alcohol so easily on random people's breath - quickly realize how everyone can smell past my cough drops and mints. I could hide nothing in actually but thought I had fooled the world.

Three great friends called me yesterday and independently told me they noticed and change and wanted to support me - so they split a very nice backpacking shelter I've been wanting as a way to encourage/support/ love me. Combined with all of your words of support - I feel strong and confident moving through my life without these addictions. Thank you everyone! I will not smoke with you today! Oh, and it's National Hot Dog Day! ;-)

What is the best hour to quit?

I tried in one time at 10 AM, was hell...
I got the conclusion that my severe withdrawals happen between 6PM - 9PM...

Guys I really need help.... I donâ€™t wanna smoke anymore nor think about it... just live life as they should and enjoy beer or two on weekends....... how de phuc do I do that?!!!!! :(((((

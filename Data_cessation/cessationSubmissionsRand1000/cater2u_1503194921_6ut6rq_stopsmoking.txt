Is anyone interested in joining a Kik quitting support group?

Tried a million times to quit. I got so close and didn't want cigarettes after stopping for 2+ weeks. However, I got stupid and when I was drunk, I asked to bum one even though I didn't even want it. Whole time I was smoking, I was thinking how disgusting the habit was and it hurt my lungs and proved to me I never want to smoke again. I finished the cigarette because I thought since the experience was so disgusting, smoking the whole thing would leave an even worse impression on me and prove to me I made the right decision to quit.

Fast forward to the next day and HA. Everyone was right. It's never just one. I think cigarettes are absolutely disgusting and gross now but that fucking nicotine... hit me like a train and now the withdrawal is so bad for me. I genuinely feel like I can't breathe.

I'm so freaking sick of smoking. Would anyone be interested in joining a Kik group to keep each other accountable? If this is against the rules, mods, feel free to delete this post.

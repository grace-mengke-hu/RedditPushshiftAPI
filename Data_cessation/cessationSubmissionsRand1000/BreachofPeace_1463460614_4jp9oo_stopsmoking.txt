Talkin' About Money

My Smoke Free app tells me that I've saved about $50 since I stopped smoking a couple weeks ago. 

So now, EVERY time I make a purchase, I just shrug and tell myself "hey this isn't real money, it's free money that you didn't spend on smoking". I've probably spent hundreds of dollars this way, guilt-free. Like now that I don't smoke, I never have to worry about money either, ha ha.

Just a goofy thing I noticed and wanted to share in case it can make someone laugh or relate.

Also on a more serious note, I recall a big motivator that someone gave me long ago. We were discussing how I spent 10 years in college to become this hot-shot professional, and he pointed out the stupidity in working so hard to create a good life (and have a super retirement one day), only to smoke, which would just ensure that it would all be cut short, and I would get cheated....well, would cheat myself.

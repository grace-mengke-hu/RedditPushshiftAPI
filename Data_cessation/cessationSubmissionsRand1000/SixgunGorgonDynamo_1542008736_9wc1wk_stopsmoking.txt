Birthday has a few minutes left. An ending and a beginning.

Been smoking 37 years. Pack and a half to two pack a day habit. Taking Chantix for about a month, gradually smoking fewer and fewer cigs per day without really thinking about it. For the past week it's been about 5 to 8 per day, intentionally avoiding lighting up during recognized trigger times. This weekend, I was vending at a renaissance faire and went all day, both days, without needing a smoke break. This will be my quit date. Wish me luck!

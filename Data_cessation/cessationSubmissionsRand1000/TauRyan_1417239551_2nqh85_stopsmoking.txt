Got busy with holidays and forgot to post! Hit my 1 year on the 25th!

I even ordered the T-Shirt from QuitNow! and everything!

I hasn't been that hard, especially lately. But every now and then I'll have a dream were I am having a celebratory smoke. I'll always wake up with a totaly WTF feeling and brush it off. then I realized what triggers it:

My wife hasn't quit. If she gets into be smelling like cigarettes, I have those dreams. We've had discussions.....

Anyway, 1 year. YAY! ME!

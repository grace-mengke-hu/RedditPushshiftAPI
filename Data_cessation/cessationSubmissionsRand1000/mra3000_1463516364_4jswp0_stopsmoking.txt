You shall not pass!

So I had insomnia last night and an early rising toddler.. and then at work my boss and clients were being micromanaging and overall "challenging" - and of course I was stuck in a room with them when my cravings kicked in hardcore.. With no water, no gum, no subreddit to lean on.. Looking back I was doing deep breathing and focused on listening to them intently. Fortunately, I (barely) managed not to bite anyone's head off. When the meetings were over I would normally have grabbed a smoke or 3 - but I didn't today. I held my ground and kept the Balrog at bay (sorry for the Tolkien reference). I did however have some sparkling water, a tasty sandwich and classical music (violins are very soothing) on the ride home and now I feel proud for winning this one battle :)

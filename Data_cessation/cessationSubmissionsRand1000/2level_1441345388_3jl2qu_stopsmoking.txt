Day 33, it's payback time!

Finally,  the emotional roller coster is over!
 Depression has faded away, my mood has been stable for about three days and the brain fog is gone. Cravings are less frequent and weaker, the occasional strong one can happen but it is expected.

A brief summary. Week one, expected hell. Week two, deep depression, demotivated amoeba. Week three, still depressed, no more novelty but dealing with relearning to handle situations without smoking while feeling odd. Week four, shittish, mood swings, I was puzzled. 

Now reading this subreddit is less compulsive and more of a pleasure. I have discovered that I can still take breaks from my worries, have some time for myself and think "fuck everything! Now it is pleasure time!"

I know that it is too early to declare victory but I am ecstatic! Besides, my badge is a star now! WOO HOOO! PAYBACK TIME!!!!! :)))        

Thank you all for your contributions, you really helped me!

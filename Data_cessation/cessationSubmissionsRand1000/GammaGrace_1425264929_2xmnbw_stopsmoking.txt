Day 5 Done

This is my third or fourth time "officially" quitting. It's going to be my last. I've been through all the withdrawals before, so they aren't daunting me. The strangest part, and scariest of this quit, is that I feel complete apathy towards cigarettes and smoking. That scares me because I almost feel like I don't care about quitting and that I could just decide to start smoking again. So far I've had no serious cravings, minimal irritability on day 1, headaches, insomnia(the shittiest withdrawal symptom so far, got 2 hours of sleep last night), and digestive issues(indigestion and constipation, yay).



I hope those resolve themselves soon! I've had some more energy, and I already breathe so much better! I moved a couple mattresses up some stairs and wasn't out of breath at all! And Ithink that even the minimal amount of sleep I'm getting is better. My cough that I've had for the past two months(remnants of a cold) has finally gone away. 


What I'm trying to say is that it gets better! And even if you fail, you can always come back and try again! Has anyone else noticed that it gets easier to handle not smoking the more times you relapse and try again?

I really feel that this is it, guys and gals. I also have decided not to drink until March 17. That is helping, too, I'm sure. It's actually kind of hard to give both up. My weekend was so boring!

8 months in and I'm beginning to crack

Hey so I quit smoking and using any nicotine in April and starting a few weeks ago I've started to really crave smoking cigarettes again So I started getting the disposable e cigarettes which are hecka expensive btw -_- but it feels like it hasnt really been helping. I've been pretty depressed and stressed out lately and today I really almost broke. Why is this happening, I was going strong for what seemed like a while. I feel like im going to relapse

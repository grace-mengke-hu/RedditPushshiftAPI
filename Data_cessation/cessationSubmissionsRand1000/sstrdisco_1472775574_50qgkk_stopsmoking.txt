16 months in and I'm still experiencing changes...

0 - 11 months, sense of smell and taste began to improve. Month 11, a dramatic increase in improved taste and smell. Months 12 - 14, more improvement. Months 15/16, another huge improvement in smell and taste. After 35 years of smoking, I NEVER thought my body would have repaired itself to this degree. I know it's different for everyone, but hopefully someone else finds this information useful and encouraging.

As a side note, I got hearing aids this past week. Now I can smell and hear when you fart. :)

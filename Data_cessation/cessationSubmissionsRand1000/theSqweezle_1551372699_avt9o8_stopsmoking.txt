Almost at a month!! Could use some advise.

I’m at 29 days 13 hours and 42 minutes!! 

So I used Chantix to help me quit. I feel like it made my quit so much easier. I really appreciated what it did for me personally and my withdrawal symptoms. 

However I’m thinking about stopping it. The constant nausea and the way it messes with my sleep cycle is really starting to get to me. I’ve decreased my dose to half a pill once a day. I forgot to take it yesterday and I’m really thinking about stopping. 

For anyone unfamiliar with it, you usually build up to the full dose over the first week and then you take two 1mg pills a day. Then you take it for about 3 months. I’d be stopping far before is recommended. Normally I would just toss em but I’m a little worried about how I’ll cope with my quit without it. I just can’t keep sleeping like this. The dreams are so friggen weird and then I’ll wake up at 2 am unable to fall back asleep. I don’t wanna keep using melatonin because I don’t want to mess with my normal chemistry. 

Has anyone else stopped taking chantix before their prescription recommended?

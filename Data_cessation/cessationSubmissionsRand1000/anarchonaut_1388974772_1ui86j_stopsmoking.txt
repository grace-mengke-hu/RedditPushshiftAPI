End of day 4, feeling hopeful but anxious.

This is my fourth quit attempt, and I'm feeling very confident this time- for once. I'm trying to quit using an ecig this time, and it's working out pretty well. Really helps with the cravings. Have any of you been successful with this method? I'm using 24mg liquid now, then I plan to ween myself down to 0. I'm a bit nervous however, that I'm actually intaking MORE nicotine with the ecig than I would have otherwise. Any advice here?

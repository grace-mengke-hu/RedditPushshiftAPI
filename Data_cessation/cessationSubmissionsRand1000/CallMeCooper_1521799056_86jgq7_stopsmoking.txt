Everything tastes and smells really good!

I had to quit smoking a few days ago because I had to get a wisdom tooth pulled (can't smoke for up to five days afterwards because of infection risk, and I **do not** want a fucking infection). I'm still hesitant to call it an actual attempt to quit smoking for good because I'm afraid I'll fail (lol at my nonsense logic, but ok). I'm doing alright so far, on day 3, using nicotine gum and a smoke free app. 

Anyway, my app told me that my sense of smell and taste should have recovered almost fully by now and it's so noticeable! I ate some fruit this morning and it tasted so good! Someone stepped onto my commute train with a fresh croissant and I could smell it before I could see it. 

Kind of amazing how noticeable the change is in such a short time. The cravings can get bad and my brain has been trying to trick me hardcore by coming up with millions of excuses to start smoking again. But I'm honestly really enjoying being free of it.

I've been repeating a phrase to myself that I read on this subreddit: 'The urge will pass, whether you smoke or not'. I wrote it on my hand, silly as it sounds, and it's kind of comforting. The only way to lessen the urges is to just not smoke anymore. I can't believe I hadn't thought of it like that before.

I picked a bad day to quit smoking...

Going through one of the hardest patches in my life - impending divorce. Went from smoking 1/2 a day to full pack. On the bright side, my /r/leaves commitment has been solid. Every day I wake up wanting to quit and all it takes is for one text, call, or even gesture from my STBX to trigger my anxiety and next thing I know, I'm back to this nasty habit. I have to stop. I'm sitting here with a nicorette lozenge behind my cheek but after so many failed attempts to quit, listening to "The easy way to stop smoking", I'm back to where ~~Robert~~ Allen Carr predicted it - surrendered to the monster. Damn this habit. I just hope to make it to the end of the day without lighting up. Subscribed, but so disappointed in myself. I have to stop.

long time smoker.... quitting cigarettes is easy.

I stopped smoking some time ago. Maybe 2 weeks? I haven't been counting. Man, it is so much more convenient to not smoke. Cigarettes are a trap. You don't need them. Would you rather be a smoker or a non smoker? 

I don't miss cigarettes, surprisingly enough. Smoker for 8 years. Longest I quit for was about a year. Then I started again after a long period of cigarette ideation finally leading to me cracking. 

But I only think about cigarettes 3-4 times a day. My life is normal now without them. I can't believe anyone found it this hard to quit? I never wanted to be a smoker. And I sure as hell don't want to live as one. The skin quality, sleep quality, lack of dreams, smells, general inconvenience of going outside in freeing temps. No thanks.

I'm going to start boxing soon and I'm already cooking more at home and eating better. I think it's a mindset - you think to yourself lies like once a smoker, always one. Or that you need cigarettes. Nothing could be further from the truth. I honestly can say that I do not miss cigarettes. And I used to LOVE and chainsmoke them.

One thing that's helping me and might help some of you is breathing - if I feel stressed, or I feel a craving, I BREATHE. Long deep inhalations. It makes me feel great. Half of the pleasure of a cigarette is just the excuse to breathe deeply. Same with joints, bongs etc (quit marijuana completely 1.5 years ago). It's just ritualistic breathing. Now I find I can relax myself whenever I want just by breathing the god given good clean air.

So yeah, have faith people. It's a lot better to not smoke. Cheaper, more convenient, healthier and you're in control of your life. Using my breathing and being glad to be free are keeping me sane and happy. I had to make a choice - do I want to be a smoker or do I not want to be a smoker? Once you synchronise the two selves - the devil and the angel - and realise what you actually want, rather than what you think you want, and it's no problem.

I don't feel any sense of loss or regret from not smoking. I feel good about it. I don't want to go back. It's no way to live. And I will thank myself when I'm old and grey and not dying of cancer.

One thing I will add though - it can be easy to reach for another hit of dopamine like a sandwich or something - I'm managing to keep my weight very manageable just by eating haloumi and avocado salads and that sort of thing - coffee is also a good appetite suppressant. 

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, I guess my point is, I'm finding it easy and rewarding, and I don't miss smoking at all. 90% of the day I don't even think about it. I don't feel any regret or sense of loss. And I know I can always breathe if I really want a cigarette.

Last time when I quit for a year, I started thinking - when I'm 70 I will smoke all the cigarettes I want. But that's wrong - you haven't actually quit. You're just a non smoking smoker at that point. And that will eat at you. Quitting is a life decision - you never wanted to be an addict. Now you're out of it. You're finally back to who you really are, not the drug addict version of you. I have given up completely and for good, and my life is actually better for it. I don't miss it at all. And I love being healthy, and being able to taste and smell again. Plus it's just a lot more inconvenient.

I can happily sit with smokers and I don't even notice it. Truth be told, I do love the smell when I'm with them, so if anything, I'm enjoying the cigarette with them. But surprisingly, it doesn't actually make me want one.

Maybe it has to do with where you are in life - maybe I'm just in a good place - but I have to say, you will be glad you quit, and don't think of it like a loss, think of it as a gain.

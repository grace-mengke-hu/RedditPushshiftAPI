I slipped but I'm not done yet

I 'quit' on new years eve, and like most resolutions, it didn't stick.  I thought that watching the hour long Allan Carr youtube video would be enough, and everything in the video made sense, but I still slipped.  I ordered The Easy Way book and it will be here soon.  I'm going to revoke my badge for now, but I am still determined, hopefully after reading the book, I will have a better chance.

I don’t have any friends left

My friend doesn’t want to spend time with me now that I quit smoking and can’t go out to drink for some time. I am good with going to the bar, but I can’t drink. And now we don’t talk anymore. She went out with someone else who drinks.
My colleagues don’t go out for a smoke with me now, so we don’t talk much. Today was work party and they went to the bar and didn’t take me with them.
I feel so isolated. And the anxiety due to my quit is just unbearable. 
I want to go to the therapist. I tried a couple but I didn’t like them. I don’t know how to choose one and if they haven’t ever smoked will they be able to understand me?
Sorry if you read that, I’m just very sad. I just arrived home from this work party, and hate myself. I know what you would say: find new friends who don’t smoke or drink, find a good therapist.. I will tomorrow. Today I need to cry and sleep.

I'm having a really hard day.

Day 3 and I'm really really really trying to keep my positive attitude.  I know for sure I don't want to smoke, but I had an absolutely terrible night last night (roommates throwing a party, making a mess, smoking and drinking), and a really tough day at work today.

What's really throwing me off more than anything is that I feel so incredibly disoriented.  I keep forgetting what I'm doing, and everything around me just seems strange.  Has anyone else had this side-effect, and how long did it take to go away?

I really want to go out tonight, but don't necessarily trust myself to have a drink without smoking.  How long did you all wait (if any time at all) before going out in to the world, and how did you cope?

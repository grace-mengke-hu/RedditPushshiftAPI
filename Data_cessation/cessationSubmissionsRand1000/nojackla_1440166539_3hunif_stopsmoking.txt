Had an "I don't smoke" dream.

I've heard of people waking up from nightmares where they had quit but were smoking in their dream but I hadn't seen anyone post about this.

I don't remember the details but I was in some kind of office, a large room with a lot of desks and people working, and I had to talk to two women about something. I was getting some bad news, health problem? lost job? someone died? not sure what. Anyway, the two ladies looked at me with some concern, turned to a table by their desks, lit up and asked me if I wanted one.

I remember thinking, "Wow, I don't remember the last time I was in an office where people smoked." Then, I looked at the ladies and said either, "I quit smoking," or "I don't smoke." Not sure which but the ladies just kind of looked at me in confusion.

Anyway, that's the best I can recall. Anybody else have dreams where they don't smoke/turn down a smoke?

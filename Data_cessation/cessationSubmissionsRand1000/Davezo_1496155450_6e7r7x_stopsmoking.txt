It's getting easier

Today I had to navigate to this subreddit to check how many days it had been since I gave up. I knew it was over two weeks, but I couldn't specify what day exactly. For me, this is huge.

During my first week I could tell you precisely how many days, and hours it had been since my last cigarette, but I can feel myself going for much longer periods of time without even thinking about smoking. There were so many occasions during that first week that I almost caved, but I hung in there. If anyone reading this is still struggling through their first week, I promise you, it gets easier.

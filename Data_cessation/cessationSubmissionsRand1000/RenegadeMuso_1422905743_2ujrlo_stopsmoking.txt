It has been 8 days since I quit, today has been the worst so far.

I want to smoke so badly that I am considering to back out of the deal I made. I told a mate that if I don't quit, I will give him R2000 (roughly $200). This is pretty much the only thing that is keeping me from starting again. 

Also, just over a year ago, the doctor told me I have chronic hypertension. He charged me an arm and a leg for hospital fees, all sorts of tests, and gave a tablet to drink every day for the rest of my life. I have a blood pressure machine at home, and on day 4 of nonsmoking, out of interest I decided to test my pressure. I was 90/50!!!!! I stopped taking the meds immediately. As a smoker, I averaged 145/100 on the meds. I tested my pressure when the meds exited my system...and I was 130/65 (normal-ish range...optimal would be 120/80 --> understandable since I have been drinking Coffee and eating anything like a beast).

The bastard doctor could have charged me $30 (R300) consultation fee and told me to quit...and done...but noooo....lets milk this loser outta his cash. 

but shit, I have so much to lose by going back to smokes...but it's all that I am thinking about now...I want it so badly. 

I hope that tomorrow will be better. I know that the road ahead is going to be a tough one. I will just have to fight each day as it comes. 

Thanks for listening :) Just needed a place to vent.

Dreams emerged out of nowhere?

I was a heavy smoker (one and half pack a day) for 10 years (since I was 14) My last cigarette was around may last year, since then I smoked only electronic cigarette until the battery broke in the middle of nowhere (camping in the woods) in the middle of september. Since I could not buy new battery for a week I stopped completely. It was not easy, but it was only one of the changes of my life at that time (broke up, moved, started running), I was not allways on my mind and I was doing ok. But than a few weeks ago I started having dreams. I did not use to dream and if so, I could not remember those. But lately I dream about smoking. It is usually similar to this: I get stressed over something and say to myself that one won't hurt. I light one up and the next day I am smoking full time again. And I am really angry at myself in the dream, that I picked up smoking again. It is effectively ruining my sleep for last month. Is there anything to do with it? Or can I punch anyone in the tobacco industry in the face to relieve myself? Thank you

TLDR: I dream about getting back to smoking and it pisses me off even in the dream.

My mom has always called me a Princess

Not in the nice way you might be thinking of, either. She meant it in the derogatory way, the "The Princess and the Pea" way. And you know what? She is right. 

I'm certainly not spoiled. I've always been really poor. Grew up below the poverty line and in abusive home to boot. And yet, I am massively offended to be told to do anything other than what I want to do.

And this is exactly why I am struggling so much right now. I am denying myself something I want. I don't do that. Usually I get everything I want because I will work until I get just what it is I want. 

This doesn't fit with that and so I have come to the conclusion that my newly found struggles, this late in to the journey, are directly connected to my aversion to not getting what I want.

In other words, I am a big baby. 

I'm okay though, just taking the opportunity to pick on myself a bit :P. Overall I actually feel pretty good about myself for making it this far, especially making it through those difficult times.

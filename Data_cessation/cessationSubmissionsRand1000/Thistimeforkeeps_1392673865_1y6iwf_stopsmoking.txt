Hospital stay. Thank God I don't smoke anymore.

Just over 2 weeks ago I fell and broke my hip (despite being too young for that type of break :) )

Anyway it resulted in having the break being pinned together and a 5 day stay in hospital.  I am so glad I have stopped smoking as

1.  My recovery from the op would have been much slower
2.  I would have been desperate for a smoke and stuck on the ward on the 7th floor until visitors came and wheeled me downstairs.

I think I am grateful for the injury because it has also thrown up some heart problems.  No doubt because of the smoking and at least they will get treated.

48 hours, Third Post

I've committed to making one post every day this week without relapsing on any nicotine. For some reason it makes me feel good throughout the day when I've been craving to know that I'll come here and write about it.

The supermarket usually makes me annoyed, today it just felt awful to be shopping for only a few minutes. The best part of the day was a shower. Then I went to work, and felt like I was able to keep every ounce of energy and focus intent on my students. The minute the lessons were over, I went to one of my AA meetings. Had a cup of coffee. BIG MISTAKE. All of the anxiety that I was stuffing while at work exploded with the coffee and I instantly felt like ripping everyone's throat out. They sympathized, but I felt like I had lost the ability to communicate with anyone. 

I don't want to talk with anyone. I don't want to deal with anyone. I either want to talk over someone about some ridiculous bullshit running through my mind, or tell them to fuck off. I feel like a ridiculous asshole, but I can't turn it off. It's midnight and I feel wide awake. Coffee, Bad. Coffee, very very bad.

I'll check in tomorrow. I have a mini-date in the evening. Not the best timing, but there's no time like the present... what am I going to do? Start smoking again? That will really boost my self-confidence.

Thanks for listening guys.

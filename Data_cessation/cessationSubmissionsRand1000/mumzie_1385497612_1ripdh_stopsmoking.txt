It saddens to say that I caved and now must start anew, but I feel the need to be honest on here and with myself.

Up until about 2 hours ago, I had been able to control my environment to a point to where I was insulated, if you will, against the temptations. I was able to lay down, get a glass of water, get on this sub and so on whenever I needed to. Up until this point I did not realize how much I was relying on having that firm control on what was around me until a little while ago when I was no longer in a this "bubble I had created for myself. I caved so hard and lit one up without a moments hesitation. I am so freaking mad at myself right now. But I will start again and take this as a lesson learned. I am going to have to make little "dashes" out of my nicotine free bubble zone, and then run back into it (mentally) until I am strong enough for continued success. Sad face:(

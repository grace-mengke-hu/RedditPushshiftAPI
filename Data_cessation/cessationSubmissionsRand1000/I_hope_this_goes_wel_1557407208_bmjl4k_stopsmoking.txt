There is true Freedom from this addiction!

Hey Freedom Fighters,

&amp;#x200B;

I felt led to write this short post to you this morning. One of the biggest questions I had while going through the quitting stage was, "will the pangs and cravings ever truly go away for good?" The answer is YES! They go away. There is complete freedom from the cravings, from the pangs, from the constant mental battle.   


**You're greatest struggle will be your greatest victory!** Push through! You're Discipline will lead to your Freedom.

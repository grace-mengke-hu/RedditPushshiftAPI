Faced a challenge this weekend and aced it

I've finally seen a group of friends who I tend to avoid like the plague when I quit - chain smokers who've been my good friends since uni. They visited me this weekend and I was fine. In fact I felt really pissed off at them smoking just outside the window as I could smell the smoke when it came in. I had a bit of a drunken rant at them about smoking and think I planted the seed in their minds. Maybe. But rather than tempt me back the whole experience just cemented in my mind that smoking is pointless and stinky :)

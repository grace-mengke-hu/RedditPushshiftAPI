asthma and nicotine and please let me be OK

Ok, so I quit smoking. Using NRT.
I also take ADHD meds and an antidepressant. 
I have some anti-histamines - guess I should take those - maybe that will help.

I exercise a lot and that seems to help, but I am at home, just chilling and notice I can't breathe as well.

Lately, I am struggling badly with ASTHMA - when I am doing nothing - and also after my runs in the hills.

Have noticed that if I don't have my patch on (slippery sucker pops off all the time) - I start getting winded at home. 

Just popped some nicotine gun and now can breathe better. 
Thoughts?
Suggestions anyone?

(Don't say go to the doctor - I have the horrible fear of what he might say - I WILL GO - just not yet ready - was hoping to have a little more time under my belt before for lungs to heal).

I know it will take time, it is just I am feeling terribly anxious. Need some positive stuff, please.

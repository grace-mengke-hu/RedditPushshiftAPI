Cough or No Cough

Curious.  Before i stopped smoking cigs I coughed a lot.  Since i started vaping never coughed at all. I believe that when you quit cigs you develop a cough as your lungs clean.  I am on day 54 down to 0 nicotine vape. 66 years old 2+ packs per day smoked 51 years   Worried no cough.

On feeling strong, pushing through and motivation

80 days in and apathy has kicked in. I very nearly smoked yesterday just so that I could have one less frustration since work/diet/gym/relationships have not been going so well for about 9 months and everything is just a chore. For instance, I have been gymming 4 times a week and calorie counted my balls off but it never gave me much joy but I maintained it just from the psychological pressure to look good.

So my question is how do you tend to all these aspects of your life whilst coping with addiction? 

I know that "non-smokers don't have to smoke to deal with this stuff", but I am so jaded at this point and I can't give two fucks about anything.

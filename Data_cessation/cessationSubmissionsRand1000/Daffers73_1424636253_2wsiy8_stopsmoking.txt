3 weeks smoke free!

So chuffed I've got this far! Must admit my cravings on some days have been unbearable but I've occupied my mind, gone for walks, took deep breaths and posted on here. I did think of getting an ecig at one point with 0 nicotine in just to help with the cravings, I think it's just the habit I'm struggling with as I don't want nicotine or to smoke an actual cigarette.

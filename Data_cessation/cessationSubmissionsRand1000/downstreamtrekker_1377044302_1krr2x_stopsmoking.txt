Day 100! I made it! YES! YES! YES!

100 days. Not one single drag. I am so damn proud of myself that I think [this is the best way to sum up my feelings.](http://youtu.be/y7MeOLymAy8?t=31s) Thanks to everyone in this sub for your support, and consider this an open invitation to message me anytime if you need advice, help fighting through a craving, or whatever! I could never have done this without the support of this sub, and honestly, I feel like this sub is way better than an actual IRL support group because support is available 24/7/365. We are awesome. :)

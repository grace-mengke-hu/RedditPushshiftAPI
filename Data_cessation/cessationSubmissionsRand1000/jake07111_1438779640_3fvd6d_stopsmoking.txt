DAY 3

On day 3, cravings hitting me like a truck. I quit ALL nicotine (smoking/vaping) 3 days ago, i woke up an hour ago and my brain is already going crazy. A thought i just had is "Do I even want to quit? I loved vaping why did I quit!?" Which i know is a bad thought and am wanting some re-assurance that quitting is a good thing! Thank you guys

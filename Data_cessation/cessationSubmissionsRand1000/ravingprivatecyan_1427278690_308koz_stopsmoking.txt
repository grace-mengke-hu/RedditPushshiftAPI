Almost 1000 days!

Yo!

I just saw another random post on /r/stopsmoking on my front page. Thought I'd click and see how I'm doing.

I haven't thought about smoking in probably a month at least. I've been with friends who smoke, I've been in cars with people smoking, I've been in smokers areas at bars.

To all you who are struggling with your first hours, your first days or weeks. It gets better, I promise you.

I'm so glad to be free of the expensive, deadly vice. My health is now top notch, I've found the drive to pursue my passions instead of just mulling them over while slowly poisoning myself.

You can all do it, just like I did. I was going to say good luck, but you don't need luck. You just need to not smoke anymore.

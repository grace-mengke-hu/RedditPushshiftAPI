Not anymore. I fucked up, but I'm back stronger than ever.

That's it. I'm done for good. Just had my last cigarette, wasn't worth it at all. I tried so hard in the past but all I could get to is 1 week, but this time I'm stronger than ever. I felt sick, and nauseas after this one and didn't even finish it.

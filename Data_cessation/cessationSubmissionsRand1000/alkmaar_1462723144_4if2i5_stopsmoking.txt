To those who tend to worry about the lack of concentration during assignments / meetings / research after quitting...

I've been there. I'd be the guy who'd smoke 2 packs of cigarettes while doing a long research paper for my masters degree thinking its actually helping me concentrate. I'd also be the guy who, before a large meeting or presentation would smoke a cigarette thinking it would take the edge off and would proceed to go smoke another one right after i was done. I'd be the one whose cigarette consumption would increase as the deadline got near. But as i reach a month i've come to realise what a load of crap ive ben inflicting on myself.


I'd be exhausted by the end of my assignments or once i was done with a long task thinking it was because of all the stress i was under. Today i've spent 13 hours total doing an assignment for uni (with approximately 2 more hours to do..yes i started on the day before submission..no i do not give a fuck) and i feel fresh and completely relaxed. I've got enough steam to keep at it until this thing is polished and ready for submission. If i was still a smoker i'd be K.O'd by now, wreaking of cigarettes and wheezing as i'll be fumbling across my keyboard trying to write a coherent sentence. 

To those who just started the journey, keep at it. I've always been the kind of guy who thought a cigarette is the solution of all of life's problems. Well it's not. And soon you'll realise that. 

Side Note: I've also lost 4 Kgs (started my journey before i quit smoking) and the whole weight-gain stuff is pure garbage. Foods like salads taste a LOOOT more fresh and better. Stick around and you'll see what i'm talking about. Peace

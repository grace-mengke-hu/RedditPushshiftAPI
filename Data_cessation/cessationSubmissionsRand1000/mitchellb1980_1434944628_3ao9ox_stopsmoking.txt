It's amazing...

17 years smoking. Many attempts quitting. Read the easyway method Friday  night and thats all it took. No more patches, cravings whatsoever. No withdrawal. No real mood swings. I just have no desire whatsoever to smoke again lol. This is day 8 I believe. Why don't more people read? Lol

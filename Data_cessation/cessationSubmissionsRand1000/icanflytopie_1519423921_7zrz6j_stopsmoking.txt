Went out to the bar last night...

First time going out to a bar without having a smoke... in the past, I would dread going to clubs, bars, &amp; parties because I would usually cave during those occasions &amp; feel so shameful the next morning. 

I feel like I’ve been missing out on a lot of fun though by avoiding those during my attempts at quitting, but being 22, I enjoy having fun at those venues. I suppose it’s just an opportunity to practice full-throttled self discipline.

Post smokers cough

I'm 2 1/2 days in and I've gotten this dry cough. Sorry if it's TMI, but they're mostly unproductive even though I can feel the drainage in the back of my throat. I know that pretty soon I'll be hacking stuff up... I'm looking forward to it because this dry cough is super duper annoying. I have questions for everybody so I can kind of know what to expect. 

Did anyone get a cough? When did it start? How severe was it? How long did it last? 

And is there anything I can do to get this dry cough moving along and be more productive? 

By the way I just had a huge craving and it went away while I was writing this!

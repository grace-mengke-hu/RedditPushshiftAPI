Hey Quitters, did you eat breakfast this morning?

As a smoker, I never ate breakfast. Now that I've quit, I make sure to east breakfast every morning. Usually a bowl of oatmeal. Cravings are almost indistinguishable from being hungry, so if you are craving, you are probably just hungry. Have a healthy snack or meal and you should be feeling better in no time....

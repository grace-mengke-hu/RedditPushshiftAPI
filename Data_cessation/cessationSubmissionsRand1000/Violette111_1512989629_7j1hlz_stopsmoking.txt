Long term side effects of nicotine gums?

"The amount of nicotine delivered in NRT is less than in cigarettes and is controlled and delivered more slowly. Smokers usually do not get as much nicotine from NRTs as from cigarettes, nor do they find NRT as enjoyable to use as cigarettes. This is because breathing in smoke through the lungs gives the brain a rush of nicotine within ten seconds of each inhalation while NRT gives nicotine more slowly through the skin or lining of the mouth. In fact, most smokers donâ€™t use enough NRT to get all the help they could to stop smoking." taken from  https://www.google.com.sg/amp/s/www.healthcentral.com/amp/article/dispelling-the-myths-about-nicotine-and-nicotine-replacement-therapy

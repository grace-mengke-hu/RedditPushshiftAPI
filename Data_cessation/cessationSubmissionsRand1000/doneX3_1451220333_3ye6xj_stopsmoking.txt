Sleeping 10 hrs a day since I quit. New normal?

I have quit smoking and drinking for about a month. I have boosted my physical fitness routine from twice a week to five times a week. All good. But I have been sleeping 10 hours a day for a month now. Used to be eight hours. I sleep well. I enjoy it. I hesitated to post but decided to throw it out there. Is this my new normal? Is it temporary. I'm interested in your experience.

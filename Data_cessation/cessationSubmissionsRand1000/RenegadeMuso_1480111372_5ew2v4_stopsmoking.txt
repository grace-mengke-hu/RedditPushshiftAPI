It have been nearly 2 years since I quit smoking. And this community has helped me tremendously to achieve that. I need your help again please.

Since quitting smoking, I picked up a few pounds that I need to lose. This is probably due to nibbling that I did to suppress the craving...or my appetite increasing once I quitted since smoking suppresses one appetite. 
 
I need to lose 17 kg / +-37 pounds in 100 days to get to healthy weight levels. I set this challenge for myself to be able to have a body that I want in order to have the experiences that I want to have.

Right now, I have no clue what to do, where to start, or how to remain disciplined to work consistently at it for 100 days.

Any information about exercise, diet or motivation will be highly appreciated,

Thank you!

Advise on cutting down smoking

So about 5 months ago i started smoking again. I had quit for a while when life wasnt so stressful. Then it hit me I started having panic attacks and weird anxiety cause of work and life (not that this is an excuse to polute my body with smokes). My wife is always asking me to quit mostly because of the cost and of course because of healthy. I live in MA where its 10 bucks a pack. I feel at this present moment with life as crazy as it is I just cannot quit cold turkey. I was thinking of going the electric cig route and slow down my smoking or at least cut back from a pack a day to maybe a half pack and go that route.. but i dunno im finding it so hard to even fathem the fact of quitting mostly cause of all the shit im getting from the wife lol.. any advise anyone?

I can smell it from a mile away it seems.

I can smell someone smoking from what seems like a mile away.  My kids canâ€™t always smell it but Iâ€™m like, no, someone is smoking and without fail, down the block, around the corner (or wherever they may be) there they are, smoking away, lol.  

At this point Iâ€™m mostly neutral about the smell.  I donâ€™t hate it but I donâ€™t love it but on occasion it makes me think... I remember that smell and itâ€™s good or on occasion it reminds me why I quit as I pass and see them smoke.  

Today as j pass the smoker, Iâ€™m thankful Iâ€™m finally in a successful quit.  I feel reminded. ðŸ™‚

Well, let's do this!

I've been a smoker for over 10 years now, about a year ago i switched to e-cig, which makes the habit less smelly, but doesn't cure you of your nicotine addiction, obviously.

My e-cig died on me recently, so I've been smoking real cigarettes again. 

But no more, didn't buy another pack yesterday, I'm done.

Day 18

I’m on the good side of this cold now.  It’s starting to subside.  Thinking back over the years, I just can’t believe how many times I’ve been sick as a direct result of smoking cigarettes.  How self defeating and foolish the habit was.  Alls well that ends well.

I’m so glad I do not smoke cigarettes.

cold turkey day 4

Dear non smoking diary

I am an irritable asshole, and am fighting with everyone. My work productivity is at about 15%. My brain keeps telling me I need a smoke.

But screw it, I'm sure it will get better soon. I have a history of not listening to my brain even when it gives me good advice, so ignoring bad advice should be easy. And anyone I offend will forgive me later, if they are important.

Perhaps a sign around my neck would be a good idea. "Warning: Stand clear of the grumpy bastard wearing this sign. Also bathe. His sense of smell is coming back"

A few weeks ago I removed my badge because of constant relapses. Now I'm at it again.

I kept stopping and starting with cigarettes over the last few months. I kept resetting my badge until I had enough and removed it altogether. I convinced myself I was not ready. Not ready to give up smoke breaks at work, not ready to give up that first one in the morning. And so on. Two days ago I put out my last cigarette and I'm ready for a non-smoking life again. I've been feeling pretty bad but that's to be expected. I'm mostly holing up in my apartment trying to ride this thing out. I've been alcohol free for nearly 8 months. Here's to 8 months and more cigarette free!

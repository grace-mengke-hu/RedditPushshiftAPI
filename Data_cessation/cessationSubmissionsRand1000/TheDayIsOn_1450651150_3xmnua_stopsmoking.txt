I quit just over two months ago and my blood pressure got higher about a month ago...

I was wondering if anyone else had something similar happen. My doctor doesn't think it could be a factor but the timing seems odd to me.  I been running more but still gained about 10 to 15 pounds. Nothing else in my life has changed. Besides that I feel so much healthier since quitting.

A big achievement for me happened yesterday

For so long into my journey I couldnâ€™t bear to watch people smoking in movies or TV. 

This week I watched a movie and a tv show that heavily featured smoking and I was fine. I barely cared except for the fleeting thought - wow smoking is great. But then immediately remembered how it truly is not great. I do not miss worrying about how I smell, worrying about my health, wasting time and money, and disappointing myself and others. This journey is WORTH IT. Just. Keep. Going! 

The movie was BlackKklansmen and the show was Dead to Me. Highly recommend if you can handle heavy smoking in shows. Otherwise TRIGGER WARNING wait til next year.

14 Days...

TODAY! To the people who are trying to stop smoking you can do this! I was a smoker for 10 years close to a pack a day! I honestly never thought I would be able to do it! I would always make excuses, "Tomorrow I will stop" "Im going through too much right now to quit." Honestly, there will always be something in life that makes us smokers want to smoke, Just know you can do it.

One thing that helped me was every time I wanted to smoke a cigarette I would deep breath until the craving stopped. I also woke up every morning and told myself "I'm not going to smoke today." Remember you have the brain that little stick of cancer doesn't! You're stronger than you think. :)

Ex smokers that have quit, Its been two weeks and I haven't been able to sleep right BUT also, My bowel moments haven't been the same? I noticed that I would always go to the restroom a lot more when I was smoking and now I go maybe once a day? Is this normal? What have you guys experienced?

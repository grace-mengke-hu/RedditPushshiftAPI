Friday is D-day!

Decided to give stopping a big try. Have before with various days/months success. Gave myself a few weeks to get my mind ready, and this is the final week to go.

Wife is quitting with me, which is going to be both a blessing and a curse. Blessing is obviously a suffer partner, and I don't have to deal with a smoker around me during my days of torture.

The curse is of course that there will be two equally horrible people in our house, each one iritated and each one ready to give up. Oh dear!

But it's worth it. We want to have kids soon, which is going to be better if we don't smoke. Also considering that our habit costs us R2000+ pm (we share a pack per day) and of course the health concerns. 

So the battle plan. Friday is a no-smoke day #1. It's going to suck, sure, but it's friday, and we have Saturday and Sunday to 100% focus ourselves on dealing with the 3 day pain.

Thereafter it's just going to be strong, dealing with it, and taking it a day at a time. The weekend will give us an edge as we don't immediately deal with the terrors of real life plus giving it up.

Anyways, will update this post as the week progresses and I near D-day. The mental preparation is important I think.

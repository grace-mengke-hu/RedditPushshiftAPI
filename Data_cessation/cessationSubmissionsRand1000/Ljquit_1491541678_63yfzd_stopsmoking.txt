Unusual triggers?

Ok, so I've noticed that my cravings are worse when the 'trigger' is a time or place when I wouldn't have been able to smoke when I was a smoker. Does that make sense? For example, I never smoked when my granddaughter was visiting, or when I was looking after her, so I was usually in mild withdrawal the whole time, looking forward to being able to feed the addiction when she went home, or I did. So, one of the things I was looking forward to when quitting was not being in nicotine withdrawal whenever I'm with her, but so far, being with her is just a huge trigger, and I feel like smoking more then than at any other time during my quit. I figure I need to remap my brain not to expect a smoke after babysitting or whatever, but it seems to be taking more effort than any of the other triggers. I didn't expect this - I thought I would have trouble  with more conventional triggers, like sitting on the porch after work, after meals etc, not at a time that I wasn't ever able to smoke. Has anyone else noticed this?

Cold Turkey vs. Replacement

I've quit for nearly two days now and have been reading nearly every post on the message board.  One thing I've noticed is several people stating they are going through the worst withdrawals around the four week mark.  Is this due to a difference in experiencing the worst of withdrawals within the first week from the cold turkey method or just a natural part of the withdrawal process?  Thanks and good luck to everyone!

I hit my 60-days and totally forgot! Oh, I have a question for runners, too!

It's actually 62 today! Yay, me! 629 not smoked, $158 saved since November 25th.

My question for runners/joggers: If you started running after quitting, how long did you wait until you started running? 

The reason I'm asking is that I'd like to start Pre-C25K and then do C25K starting on Feb 2nd.

Thanks!

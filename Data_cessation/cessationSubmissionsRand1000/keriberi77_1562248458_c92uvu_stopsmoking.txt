My son just crushed my cigarettes

I only just decided a couple of days ago that I was going to quit on the 4th. I had 3 left in my pack, so my son crushed them and threw them away this morning. Now I'm sitting here with my coffee needing one. The craving is intense! I'm not looking forward to the weeks ahead!

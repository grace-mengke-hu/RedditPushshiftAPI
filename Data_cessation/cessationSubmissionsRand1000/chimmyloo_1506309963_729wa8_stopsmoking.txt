I need help

I smoked twice in the past week while drinking. Tonight I was totally sober, drove to the gas station, bought a pack, and smoked one cigarette before asking my brother to hide it for me. I went 76 days before that first drunken mistake, so ignore the badge, I guess I'm back to 0. I can feel I'm on the brink of a full blown relapse and I'm not sure what to do. Please, advice??

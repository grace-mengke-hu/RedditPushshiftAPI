Nipping the munchies in the bud ...

Since day 1 I have been on a mission to eat everything in site, I have had to seriously control the urges to just eat everything I see, or I would be in serious trouble.. Tried the chewing gum thing, even tried sucking on sugar free mints..   Not really the best solutions, in most cases you end up with a tummy ache..    so this is how I have managed to curb the manic eating frenzy... I started little projects to start, like painting the walls, re- potting the garden, and just keeping busy.   Then I started downloading every Paleo recipe I could find, and a little banting too, just to make sure that If I do snack, the snacks are healthy and carb free.. I did not want to be a statistic, as everyone was saying to me, the minute you stop smoking, you pack on the weight, I am however training pretty hard right now, but still if you consume more than you burn, it will still happen.

What other methods have you guys used to prevent weight gain after stopping?   Interested to hear your thoughts..

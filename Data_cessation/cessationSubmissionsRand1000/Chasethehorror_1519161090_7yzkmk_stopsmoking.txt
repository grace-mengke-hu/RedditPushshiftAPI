Today is two months!

Technically, I slipped up a few weeks ago on Superbowl Sunday, but I only had one cigarette while super drunk and regretted it so ehhh let's just pretend it doesn't count haha.

It feels so much better than I thought it would. The desire to smoke has gone down quite a lot, and I get cravings less and less throughout the day. I'll go hours without even remembering that cigarettes exist/this subreddit exists/that I quit. And then when I do remember, instead of missing the nicotine rush I'm like "ehhh that made it really hard for me to breathe, I smelled bad and it was an inconvenience, I'm better off without it."

It's funny, I never realized how much I hated smoking until recently. Like I read Allen Carr's book and he kept saying that we (smokers) hate smoking, but I never felt that way. Now that I look back on it, I realize how inconvenienced I really was by smoking, how much harder it was to breathe, and how it wasn't as great as I thought it was. 

I also struggled with bad anxiety and depression for a bit, but that's lifted and isn't as debilitating as it was for a while. Thankfully ugh.

I know that I have to be vigilant still. Sometimes I still get a craving for *something* and I can't fill it with a cigarette. Today is an unusually warm day and I thought "wow it'd be nice to sit outside and smoke a few." But it's also a hell of a lot easier to dismiss those thoughts.

So keep going everybody!! We got this!!

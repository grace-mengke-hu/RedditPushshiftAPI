Just got a badge! Wish me luck

Ok. Here's to another go at stopping. I'm feeling pretty positive! So requested a badge. 
Read the Carr book a couple times in the past year. Also tried every method available...patch, e-cigs, gum, champax, etc. 
I realize I just have to do it cold turkey and ignore my drug addict mind when it tries to trick me.

I've learned a lot from my past fails. So I'm loaded up with healthy snacks, bookmarked this site, got a journal to vent when I'm moody, yoga classes set, and even planned a house cleaner to come once a week for the next two weeks (I stress out big time in the past when the house gets too messy when I quit)

I'm serious about this time!!! 

Wish me luck. Can't wait to feel what you all feel.

Small Update

Just finished day 5 of cold turkey, and at the moment I'm feeling kind of crappy, but overall I've been quite surprised at how smoothly the past 24 hours or so have gone.  Day 3 and the first several hours of day 4 were hell, but yesterday it was like a fog lifted and I found myself working at my daily duties without any discomfort at all.  Of course, I know it won't always be like that in this process, but it was nice to get a small taste of it so soon.

Some changes I've noticed:  I can smell the early spring breeze, and for some reason being able to do that means a lot to me.  My heart didn't palpitate when I lifted weights today.  I'm less tired than usual (or at least I was less tired today).  I feel cleaner.  I feel more confident around women.  I think I've won some respect from my colleagues.  I think my usually extremely low self-confidence is beginning to improve.  I was worried about getting my school work done while quitting, but I think I got more done than I normally do when smoking.

I've also gotten this app for my kindle fire that will help me keep track of money I'm saving (about 15 bucks so far) and improvements I'm making in my health.

Tomorrow's going to be a bit of a challenge, because I'm going to a reading group with some colleagues where there will be some wine, but I'll do my best not to smoke.  I've come too far to fall so easily.  However, you might want to be on the lookout for SOS posts from me!

Thank you guys for all the support, and good luck to all of you in your efforts to quit.

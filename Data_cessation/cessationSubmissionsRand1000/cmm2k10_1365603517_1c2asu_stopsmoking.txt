So day three... how do I feel so bored??

My husband and I were both commenting on how bored we felt not smoking. Is that the stupidest thing ever? So not much has changed except we don't take that 5 minute walk outside every hour or so. Addiction has such a crazy way of fucking with your mind! I am not bored! And no I can not just have one a day.. that thought went through my mind too. What if I just had one or two a day that would be a lot better than what I did before right??... NO NO NO none!! So so far I haven't smoked for 2 days, 3 hours, 11 minutes & 38 seconds!  Not smoked 32 cigarettes and saved $10.24 according to my handy dandy app!

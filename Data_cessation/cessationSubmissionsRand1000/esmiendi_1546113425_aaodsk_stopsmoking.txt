This Christmas till new year bit is harder than I thought

I thought Christmas itself would be difficult because of celebrating and stuff, but it's actually this bit inbetween that's the worst.

Christmas is over, I'm back at home but not back at work till Jan 3rd, my friends are still visiting family abroad and I'm just alone and bored as fuck. I dunno what to do with myself sat here all day, at least smoking used to break up the boredom a bit! For once in my life I feel like I can't wait for the holidays to end...

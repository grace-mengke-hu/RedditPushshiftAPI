3 days of hell but got through it, feeling positive!

Quit for 2 months now, had the couple of cravings a day that you get through. But boy oh boy out  of the blue for 3 solid days the nicotine gremlins came and would not leave me alone. But hey I woke up today and they have gone. So glad I didn't give in. Think I've got it this time round. Just fight through it don't give in! Happy me !

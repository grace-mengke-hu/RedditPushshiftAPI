Feels good!

hey guys, 

Just want to say, i feel amazing. I have more money, i feel like im not under pressure all the time, like tense yknow. Fuck, its been such a long stupid struggle, i know now that this time is different, i am changing the course of my life and it feels amazing. Got drunk the other day and felt sick smelling cigs. Didnt even want one after a meal. Been through alot of stressful situations and now i welcome them without a cig! The only thing i regret is smoking for as long as i did(7 years). Just want to thank people here who sticks around to help others with advice or words of encouragement. I know i am going to stay here and try to give people encouraging words for as long as i live or until the internet is no more. From the bottom of my heart, thank you, all of you. Keep fighting the good fight. As one person said to me, its not about quitting its about living! Fall in love, build don't destroy. Its precious, our time here is worth more than anyone can write a check for. You owe it to yourself, to smoke your last and take your life back! 

I love you all, I cant wait to hit 365 days, keep it up everyone. Thank you a million times over. Thank you.

Enlightening Relapse

So I relapsed and bought a pack this evening after 25 days of being smoke-free.  I hate that I did this, but after just a few puffs of one Marlboro, I was genuinely repulsed by the taste of it, it truly made me physically-ill, and I put it out immediately and threw the rest of the pack away.  It was a complete waste of money but my reaction to it has made me realize that I can continue to be happy as a non-smoker and I really can’t fathom that I ever smoked in the first place and I can’t believe I have felt like I was missing out on something this past month because I’m really not at all.  I just need to recognize that I miss this romanticized ”idea” of cigarettes, but I really don’t miss the cigarettes themselves.  This relapse was poor decision on my part but it just reinforces my desire to continue to not smoke, just wanted to share with you guys!!

Smoked half a cigarette.

Four days in and I came home to find that my husband helped with zero housework, left his half eaten lunch on the table in which our new puppy got into and she proceeded to go to the bathroom all over the floor (it probably upset her stomach). This is all after a terrible day at work.... ugh. Things were going so well and I feel like I just messed it all up. The cigarette I was smoking I just felt wrong about so I put it out halfway through, now I still have the entire rest of the pack I just bought.

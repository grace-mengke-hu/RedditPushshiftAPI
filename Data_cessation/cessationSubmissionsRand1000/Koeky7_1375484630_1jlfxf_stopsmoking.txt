I feel sad.

Hello quitters!

I am smoke free for 109 days now. For me it's a huge thing. I am happy I am not an addict at the moment. 

Too bad this is all not true. After these 109 days I still want to smoke every day, every hour, many times a day. I still feel the urge to smoke everytime I pass a cigarette sign on the street, everytime I see someone smoking, everytime when I don't keep my mind occupied. 
I want to smoke atleast every hour. Today when I was working I felt the urge to smoke for hours, today I was doing rather mindless work so it was easy to think about.

At this moment I would rather give up years of my life to just smoke. 


Someone please help. I'm not going to win this way.  I want to smoke, smoking was always the thing that helped me trough hard times. It gave me a relieve when I was having a workday of 15 hours. (For half I year I worked +/- 15 hours a day, not really legal and stuff). At those moments, cigarettes where a godsend.


I don't know what to do anymore.


Edit: I am thinking about it now. Maybe I should see a professional. Maybe I am depressed or something. I don't know.

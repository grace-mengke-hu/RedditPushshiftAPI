What 200 days has gotten me.

Smoked half a pack to a pack a day for 35 years. I quit cold turkey.

* I have gained weight.
* I have tasted food that has brought me to tears from the pure joy of flavor.
* For Halloween I went to a pumpkin carving party. The moment everyone cut into their pumpkin I got an overwhelming wave of pumpkin smell. I got a little choked up, I haven't smelled a pumpkin in years.
* My heart doesn't feel like it's beating uncontrollably. The feeling of anxiety is gone.
* Smokers cough is GONE!!
* My hands and feet are warm.
* My skin looks better, I have such nice color.
* Aside from the weight gain, I feel so much better. 

I can't wait to see what Christmas smells like!!

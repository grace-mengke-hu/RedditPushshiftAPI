Left outdoor swimming pool and it Hit me in front of my face

I was drenching from a public swimming pool and I was about to leave. Walking into the men's changing room to dry up... I see a guy with a pony tail packing his bags and there it was..... a cigarette lodged on the left side of his head and on his ears.

I thought to myself... wow addiction is a powerful thing. The guy's not even ready to leave or finished packing his things... it would seem that his conscious mind is distracted by the task at hand... However, his body language is showing what is the priority right now. He's in a hurry... focused like a sniper aiming to smoke. It is THE MOST important thing on his list right now: HIS CRAVING IS HIS TOTAL PRIORITY. 

This moment made me realize how grateful I am to be free. I used to be that guy. In fact, I can remember examples of being much worse. 

The nicotine Monster has no hold on me anymore. Thank God. I AM FREE

Rejoice

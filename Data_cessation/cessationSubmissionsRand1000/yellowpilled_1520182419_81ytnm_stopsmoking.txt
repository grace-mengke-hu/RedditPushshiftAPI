The feeling of being in control

Hey guys,

just wanted to share something with you. Since I stopped smoking I feel like I have way more control about my life. It still feels me with pride knowing that I escaped the cancer sticks and somehow this translated into me feeling like I can achieve way more than I do right now. I somehow lost faith in myself but quitting made me realize that I can do so much to shape my life the way I want it to be.

Im still in my early 20s, everything is possible. Just wanted to share this with you and if you're still smoking I hope you can feel this pride one future day aswell!

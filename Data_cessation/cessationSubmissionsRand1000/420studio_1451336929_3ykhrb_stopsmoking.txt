3 Months

Got a notification that today marks 3 months. Feels great to be nicotine free. Anxiety has almost fully gone away. My diet has gone back to normal (not eating cause I'm bored/replacing smoking with eating). And most of all I feel 1000% better about myself and I am more confident in myself. I know its still early to say but I am fairly confident I will never smoke a ciggerette or any nicotine ever again. 

Wanted to say thanks to this community and will continue to every month as this sub helped me more than anything.

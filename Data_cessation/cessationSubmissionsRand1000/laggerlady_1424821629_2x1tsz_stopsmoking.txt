Day 2 -

Okay, day 2 is a tough one. Brain playing all manner of tricks to try and get me back on the nicotine. Holding my own , so far, trying to not substitute food for smokes. I am even drinking herbal tea, which if you know me, I am not the herbal tea type, more a good rum and coke but better to slay this demon first!

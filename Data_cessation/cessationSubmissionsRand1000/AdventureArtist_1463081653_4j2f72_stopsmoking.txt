dat flair tho - 1120 days booya

Ah, the life of a non smoker... crisp, refreshing. Girls be like, "you smell so good". Baby powder fresh. Ash on ash? Nope. Burn holes in favorite shirt? Nope. Morning hack? Nope. Excusing myself from dinner? Nope. Leaving movies early? Nope. 

Smiling. Living. Energetic. Bright. Happy. Success. Success. See you over here, friends. Yup.

Hello Smokers/Ex-Smokers

So i'm currently on Day 4. It's been pretty easy to be honest, I've been a bit ill with a cold and cough, so this time round it's been fine, but i'll share my story! I went smoke free for 3 months, May - July. Then on a night out, i swear to god, I thought I could of got away with having a single cig. Massive mistake. I had about 5 that night in the end and by the end of the WEEK, I was back on 10 a day. Yes, it's really that easy and i know some of you will say "what made you smoke after all that time?" my honest answer... there is no reason. I genuinely believed I could of smoked that night and been fine. Well, it really doesn't work like that and so, until now, I was smoking pretty solidly and all I've gained since I started smoking again was weight, laziness and smelling of shit. Good luck everyone and remember, not one puff.

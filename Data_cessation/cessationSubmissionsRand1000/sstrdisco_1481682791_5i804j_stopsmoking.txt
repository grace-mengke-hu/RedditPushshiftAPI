Heck yeah, 600 days!

I'm celebrating 600 because I'm quite fond of the number 6. When I first quit, everyone kept saying, "it gets easier." That is a true statement, indeed. If you're just starting out, please believe that. Here's to being able to breath, taste, smell, and all the other great things that come with not smoking!

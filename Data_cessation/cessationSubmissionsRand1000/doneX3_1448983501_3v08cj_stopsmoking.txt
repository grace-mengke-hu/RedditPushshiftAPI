Week 2. Nicotine is a drug that helps anxiety a little. I can do better.

I previously quit and stumbled in Week 2. I'm struggling a bit at the same point now but I think I have an answer.

Week 2, I'm past physical withdrawal. Challenge is that something missing feeling. I struggle with Allen Carr's view that there is nothing pleasurable in smoking. Fact is, nicotine is a drug. It gives a little buzz. For some people, including me, it eases anxiety. I know it also causes anxiety, but I don't think it's an even sum. Neuro chemistry differs between people, and I think smoking helps some with anxiety, a little.

A little. Very little. Cigarettes are a cheap drug. Not in cost but quality. There are much better drugs out there. 1. Real prescription drugs for anxiety. 2. Illegal ones if that's your thing. 3. The dopamine rush from exercise. 4. Good food that you can now afford without cigarettes. 

Writing this down helps me put that pestering question to rest. Hope it helps you too.

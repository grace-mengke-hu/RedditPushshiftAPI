Two weeks finished

I've got two weeks under my belt. No smoke no nicotine. I was stressed and had some cravings tonight, I'm glad I didn't smoke. It is getting easier overall.

I focus on one day at a time, just stay focused on today and then be proud of each and every day you stay off it. Easy way, whyquit and this sub help too.

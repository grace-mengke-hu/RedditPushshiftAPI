Day 4...

This is where I relapsed last time and came on this sub to moan.  This morning, I felt the real urge to smoke again (must be a day 4 thing), but resisted to avoid having to post another relapse post under my user name.  I will not smoke today so I can go further than I did last time.  I really might be doing it this time

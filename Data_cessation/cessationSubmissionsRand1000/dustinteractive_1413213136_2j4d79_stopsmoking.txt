Thousands of cravings killed and this sub made it happen.

Recently, I posted a link to the quit smoking app that this sub inspired me to build during my months of quitting myself. You all gave me amazing feedback so I wanted to post an update to tell you how I implemented it.

We now offer the ability to go into settings and change your Quit Date (for users who quit prior to downloading the app).

We also have added more trophies, facts, and fixed several bugs.

For those of you who may not have caught the previous post. The app, QuitCharge, is 100% free and it's available for Android and iPhone. It has become an instant success and I owe that to my friends in this sub.

I'm always looking for feedback. Please tell me what you think! And keep being awesome!

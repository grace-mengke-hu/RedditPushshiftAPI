Dude, 1 Week!!!

Dude! It's already been a week! I got kinda sick a couple days ago, but I stayed in bed, ate some cheerios, chicken noodle soup, and grilled cheese sammiches until I felt better. Before, if I didn't feel good when I woke up it was outside right away to light up. I think my brain is starting to rewire itself. :)

I have been using my e-cig. But I've been taking a couple puffs maybe twice a day. If I don't have it, I don't crave it though. It's pretty fantastic.

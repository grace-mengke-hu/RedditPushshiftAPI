He so wasn't worth a pack of cigarettes

I had been dating someone. I thought he was perfect for me. Smart, nerdy, funny, etc. Last night, I saw a new side of him and the relationship is over. Sigh . . . I bought a pack of cigarettes. Because as we all know, smoking CURES EVERYTHING. <sarcasm>

My best friend quit almost 2 years ago. He is the reason I threw the pack away, came here, reset my badge and said "Girl, get it together" What he said was "So, you are going to show him by restarting a habit that is disgusting, bad for you, and horrible?" 

And he's right. I was so proud. Today would have been 28 days. Instead, tomorrow will be Day 1. I smoked. I'm still single. Nothing changed. The magical powers of cigarettes must have disappeared ha.

So, here's my honesty. 

And he picked the worst time. I outdid myself on Valentine's Day gifts. I tracked down a movie he loves but couldn't find and also ordered a print of a photograph he loved. (Can't find anywhere else. My friend is the photographer). Oh well, the picture will look great in my living room and I'll return the movie and use the money to buy a new pair of shoes . . . running shoes :D

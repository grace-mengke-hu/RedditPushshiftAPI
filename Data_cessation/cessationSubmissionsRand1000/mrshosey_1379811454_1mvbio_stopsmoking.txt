Oh the smell

I've quit for 132 days now, my husband still smokes in the house and car, and that's fine by me (We both agreed we would never make the other quit). Most of the time the smell doesn't bother me. But every once in a while it is just..yuck. Have any of you found a good spray or candle that kills the smell and not just smell like burnt flowers?

I'm at a cafe where I've drank coffee and smoked for ~12 years.

Day 4.  
I am sitting here working on stuff as usual. 
Not surprisingly, my brain eventually wanted some kind of break, what would have usually been a smoke break.  
I kind of went "ugh" for a second and then immediately realized I don't want to smoke AT ALL, but just need a damn break sometimes.  
I went for a walk.  
Got back to work.  
Feel great physically -- already way better than I did 4 days ago because I'm not ingesting poison every 3 hours.
Take that day 4.  
  
Join me in not smoking tonight?

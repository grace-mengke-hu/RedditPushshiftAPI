Depressed about my smoking habits.

Hi fellow quitters,
I'm 23 now and been smoking for 4ish years. I tried to quit a 100 times before but never made it past the first week. 
3 days ago, I just felt this urge to quit this bad habbit and threw away all my cigs, but by now I feel horrible.
I'm nervous the whole day, I feel sad whatever I do, and the worst is this feeling, that I will stay depressed the rest of my life if I don't smoke.
Since about the 2nd day, the strong cravings are gone, but I always feel light headed and like something important is missing in my life.
I forced myself to just lay in bed the whole day, so I won't just buy some cigs and start all over again, but I'm really scared, when I have to go to work tomorrow, I just can't bear it anymore.
What can you guys suggest me to do?
When will these horrible feelings go away?
I'm near to the point where I give up, to this devilish addiction.

Trying again - third time's the charm

So I've been smoking now for most of the last twenty years.   I quit about fifteen years ago without a second thought - just stopped.  Picked it back up a few years later, smoked again for several years.  That time, I realized I no longer had it within me to quit on a whim. 

I endured, though, and ended up using a vape to kick the habit.  Started with a crapton of nicotine, worked my way down to zero.   Thought I was good, gave away my setup, and then promptly started smoking (!!) again within several weeks.  Haven't tried to quit again since then, which was about two years ago. 

Determined this time to quit and stay quit.  Went and bought a small vape (Pico 85?  I think?) and some high nic juice to get me started.  No smoking in bars where I live now, so hopefully that'll help with the part that has always been my greatest weakness.  Wish me luck - glad to have this resource as I make my way through the hardest phases.

4 months!!

Today is 4 months for me!  Totally smoke-free!  No lapses, no "just one quick puff from my friend", NOTHING.  This, my friends, is the best I've ever done.  I feel fabulous!  Yes, I think about having a smoke sometimes--but the urge passes quickly.  

I used the app QuitGenius.  Please check it out if you're looking for some support.  :)

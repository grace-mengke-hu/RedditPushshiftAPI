I can not believe..

I have been a whole 32 days without a cigarette.  I remember back to when I was smoking and thinking how near impossible it would be to give this habit up, but now I have made it farther without a cigarette than I have in the past 5 years. It feels truly amazing.  No more mornings couching a lung up, no more episodes of extreme mucus, no more feeling like I NEED to smoke to make it through my day.  If you are still on the fence about quitting.. I urge you to give it a try.  Even if you fail, at least you gave it a shot and know what to expect. Quitting those nasty cigarettes is all mental, and I believe each and every one of you reading this can do it. Don't get me wrong though, I still have major cravings every once and a while but they reside and get less and less as time goes on.  Thank you r/stopsmoking for helping me on this journey. Much love.

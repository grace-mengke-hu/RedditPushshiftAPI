1-2 packs

I see alot of people writing about habits of less less than 10 cigs a day for a long period of time. I have recently turned 20 and i was at 2 packs a day for a year then cut back to 1 and everyone i knpw who smokes is around a pack a day so i always figured it was an "ok" amount and i guess im jist taken back at the amount i smoke so its what made me wamt to quit now

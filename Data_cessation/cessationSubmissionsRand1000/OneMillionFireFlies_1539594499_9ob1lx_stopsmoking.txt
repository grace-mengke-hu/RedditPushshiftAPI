I slipped after just 24 hours.

Barely 24 hours into my quit, I slipped. I am sharing this to declare that I am not down and out. I will reset my quit stats, and mention my consumption in craves. 

I need to remain hopeful, and not take too much of guilt to start my quit again. Otherwise it's downward spiral for me again.

Day 54 - Strengthen my Resolve. Remind me why I quit...rant

Not a puff no matter what! Smoking only causes additional stress in my life. It was taking away my time left to live. I’m afraid of getting cancer and not being around to see My son’s kids. I want to hug them and love on them like I do with My daughters kids. They need me to be healthy and strong. Not weak and sickly. Cigaretttes stink and are an embarrassment. I am not going to expose my family to second hAnd smoke. I have no right to do this to me or my family. Cigarettes bring nothing only take my life expectancy and health. It was all a lie and I will never ever be a slave to it anymore!!!

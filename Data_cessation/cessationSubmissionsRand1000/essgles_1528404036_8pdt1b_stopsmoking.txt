What keeps you going?

Day 15, cold turkey of my longest and most successful quit. I've been hit with a really low mood and lethargy today so just trying to remind myself of how I've got this far and what keeps me going. 

For me: Rediscovering my sense of smell, the people I love and want to quit for, feeling my lung capacity get better each day, the feeling of clean teeth, positive reactions, the highs that come between the lows, knowing I cannot and will not be a smoker at my next job, the smoke free app, sleeping better than ever before - even if the days feel impossible sometimes - and sour lollipops (seriously: they are a godsend for cravings). 

How are you getting through?

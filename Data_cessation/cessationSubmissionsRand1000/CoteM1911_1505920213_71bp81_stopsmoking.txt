First smoking dream. I always thought it was bullshit... it's def not.

Never was an avid dreamer. Had a smoking dream last night. Got drunk with some friends and smoked almost a whole pack. Had somehow 'forgotten' I quit and only remembered the morning after and felt HORRIBLE about it. 

Woke up this morning grateful as all hell. I thank the dream in a way for making it not a pleasurable experience at all. Only reaffirmed that fact that if I do pick up at this point I'll feel like a total asshole.

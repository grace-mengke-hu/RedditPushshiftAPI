Craved female companionship and cigarettes in my dream last night...

I'm quitting smoking on hard mode: little over a month ago, I took a plunge off the marriage cliff and into the murky abyss of impending divorce by moving out. I also quit smoking - figuring that now is the best time to cut two toxic multi-year relationships out of my life. So far so good, if you don't count 2x relapses when I smoked 2-3 sigs after drinking. Heavily. 

Fast forward to last night and I have this weird dream: I meet this really sweet girl and we're definitely clicking... when she asks me for a cig. I say sure and by habit reach into my car's arm rest, where I'd typically have a pack sitting. And then, still in my dream, I say - "Oh shit, sorry, forgot - I quit a while ago. I don't have any smokes". 

What I found bizarre is that as soon as I said that, I started craving a cig, but even in my dream I didn't cave and remarked on the fact that I thought something along the lines of: "If I try to impress her by driving and buying a pack, I'd be a smoker again". So, I just had to carry on that dream conversation without cigarettes.  :)

thought I'd share and ask if there's any significance to this or just par for the course.

Day 2. Lightheaded.

It's the evening of Day 2. The cravings surprisingly weren't as bad as they were on Day 1. Maybe it's because I avoided a lot of triggers today (caffeine, certain places). One should definitely go out of their way to avoid em early on.

So caffeine- and nicotine-free, I was having micro-naps for the first half of Day 2. I'd snooze watching my kid go thru his homework or reading a news article.

2nd half of Day 2 is all about being dizzy and feeling lightheaded. It doesn't feel like I'd reach a point where I might faint, but it's not that far off either. Is it because my body is still getting used to the extra oxygen?

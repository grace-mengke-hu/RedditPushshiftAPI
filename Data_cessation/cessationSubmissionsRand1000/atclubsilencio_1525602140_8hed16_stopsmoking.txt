Nicotine patches causing chest pains and an elevated heart rate?

I'm on day five of quitting, and still going strong. My doctor originally prescribed me some nicotine patches to help me with cravings. Since I had been smoking about 2 packs or more a day he put me on the highest dosage of 21  mgs. First day was fine, but then I noticed the past several days my heart beat would be racing a million beats every night and I always felt winded. Then I started getting these really awful pains that would come in spasms starting in the left side of my back, to the frnt of the left chest. Sometime feeling like they were just within my chest, rather than front or back. They were very similar to the cardiovascular related pains I've felt with other drugs. I'm hoping at least it is that, and not lung cancer developing right when I am ready to kick the habit. Though it would be darkly humorous. 

Has anyone experienced these symptoms with patches? Should I try cutting them in half and only wearing a smaller strip of them? Or even 1/4th of one? 

I'm actually typing this now to fight a craving, but it's passed now so I'm good. But I'm just hoping I don't have cancer or something.

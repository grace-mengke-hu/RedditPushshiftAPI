Day 0 - I wonder what tomorrow brings..

*Not sure if my badge is updated yet. I'm on my phone*

As of 2 minutes ago, I just had my last cigarette. I hope. A few years ago I quit smoking for 3 months. I used nicotine gum for a week, cutting down heavily. On he 7th day, I almost had a piece at 7 pm. Had one chew and decided it would probably be better to just go to bed. 

It was a glorious time. After a few weeks, I was in control and I could easily say no. It went splendidly, until about thee months in when I had a Thursday. Yes, a Thursday. It wasn't that it was a particular bad day, but not a good one either. I was a bit depressed, doing a project for work at a different office with people that weren't all that social. I was feeling a little bummed, so I decided I would have a cigarette. It tasted horrible, yet I had another, and another. 

Since then, I have tried and quitting several times. Heck, I even eat nicotine gum during the day. But not to reduce smoking. Im so addicted to the gym that I will litters loy take a piece 5 minutes after I've had a cigarette. A bad habit just got a lot worse - so this needs to stop. 

I want to quit cold turkey. The gum isn't helping me as it did before. I need a clean break, but from past experiences, this is going to be tough. Aside from the cravings, my body gets super weird after a couple of hours of not smoking. I literally feel like I'm drunk, and not in the good way. My speech is slurred, my vision is blurred, and I feel horrible.

A lot has changed since I started smoking again. I've lost around 70 kg and I am a healthy guy aside from the smoking. I am telling myself that if I can control my weight, then I can control the cigarettes as well. 

Here's to a new start. I'm going to sleep now. If anybody have any words of encouragement, I shall look forward to reading them tomorrow. And if anybody has any tips to avoid the blurriness, please let me know!

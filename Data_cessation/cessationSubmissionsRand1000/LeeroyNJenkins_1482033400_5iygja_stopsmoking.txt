51 days

meant to post yesterday when I hit 50 but got caught up at work - I feel awesome. I can finally take deep breaths and enjoy the very cold winter air clearing my lungs, I can finally taste my food properly and I can finally say I am disgusted by cigarette smoke. it hasn't been easy but like all good things in life you have to work hard for them and I don't plan on ruining it.

stay strong.

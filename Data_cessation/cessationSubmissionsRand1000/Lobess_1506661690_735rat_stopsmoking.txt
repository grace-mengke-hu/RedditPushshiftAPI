Nine Months Free!

Quitting smoking was the best opportunity to live life with true authenticity and seeing without the lenses that was veiled by nicotine.  No more sneaking a puff to settle my nerves, and that swelling feeling that if I did not smoke one, I was going to be 'lose it'.  No more waiting for 7/11 to be empty so no one would see the shame that I had to have another expensive pack.  No more Hoodie over my head while the 25 mph winds belt outside, irritating me because that stick was tricky to light as rain drops got it wet.  No more denying myself and my family on outings because I was so worried about the jonesing for a cigarette.   No more avoiding the dentist and doctors eyes when asked if I still smoke.  Nope, for nine great months, it has been pretty fucking freeing!  If I can do this after 31 years of smoking you can too!

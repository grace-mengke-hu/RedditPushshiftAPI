16 hours in, and I feel like breaking down and crying

Stopped on a whim yesterday, slept for about 6 hours and now feel like an absolute mess. My head feels dizzy, i can't concentrate for shit and I'm completely on edge. I have work in seven hours and I don't know if I'll get through there since I work at a hospital and that's super stressfull at times.
It's not an actual craving but just a constant feeling of complete dread.

But enough of the ranting, what can I do to get to the next 3 days until it gets better? Any advise is much appreciated.

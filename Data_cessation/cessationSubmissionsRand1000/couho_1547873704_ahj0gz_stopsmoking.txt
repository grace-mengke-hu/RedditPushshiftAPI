Question: triggers leading to relapses

I’ve been on this sub for a couple of months now, and have seen a number of comments/posts about relapses. As one who initially smoked 17 years (no more than 3/4 pack per day at that time) then quit cold turkey for 2 years just to relapse (due to error in judgment that “one night of smoking won’t hurt if drinking with old smoking friends”) for 5.5 years harder than before my first quit (at least a pack a day), I want to ask what the most common relapse triggers have been for everyone. We can all learn from each other, I hope? Here are some questions I’m interested in, I look forward to hearing from you!

1. How many years have/had you been smoking for?
2. How much smoking at the worst times?
3. What has been your longest smoke free duration to date?
4. Did you relapse?
5. If you relapsed, why? What was/were the trigger(s)?
6. How long did/have you relapsed for?
7. Did the smoking intensity increase after the relapse?
8. If smoking intensity increased, by how much?
9. What has been the most helpful thing for you to aid in your quit?

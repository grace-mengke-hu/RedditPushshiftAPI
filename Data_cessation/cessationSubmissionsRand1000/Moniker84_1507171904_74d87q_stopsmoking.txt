Mentally unhealthy

Lately it's been pretty hard for me to not smoke.  With the help of Chantix I was able to go 37 days smoke free.  Then during a manic episode I bought a pack.  I smoked for 5 days.  Once the pack was gone I quit again.  That was like a week ago.  
Quitting hasn't been easy for me.  Right away I knew it was going to take its toll on my mental stability. I am diagnosed bipolar 2 and unmedicated. I have always been able to maintain, but Something I've noticed here in the past week or two is that I've been diving deeper into a pretty dark place. 
I'm cycling very rapidly between mania and depression and each phase seems to be intensified so much by me not smoking. 

Today has been particularly difficult.  I've been having a panic attack all day long.  It's so bad that it physically hurts my chest.  I want to smoke.  Not because I need or want the nicotine,  but more because it's such a familiar old friend that has been there for me through many of my messy bipolar days.  

I am ready to be a non smoker but it's been so hard because quitting has made my symptoms so much more severe than usual.

How do you deal with triggers?

For most of us, alcohol is a trigger. For me, it's my main trigger. 

I know, avoid alcohol while starting off this journey. However, it doesn't matter if I'm 4 days in, 4 months in, 2 years in, I get triggered during one episode of drinking thinking (I'll just have one) and then I end up being a smoker again.

I just want to know how you all deal with your triggers? 

(For the record - I'm on my 4th day today and avoiding alcohol currently. just looking toward the future)

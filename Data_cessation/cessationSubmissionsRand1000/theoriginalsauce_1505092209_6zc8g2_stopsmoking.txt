Day 3

I'm on my 3rd day of not smoking and I'm not really having cravings for them. If I do get a craving I make myself do a really tedious chore as punishment.

Also I just had my wisdom teeth ripped out of my skull so that's pretty much the driving force behind being smoke free.

I know three days isn't as impressive as 3 weeks or a year but I haven't gone this long without a cigarette in 10 years so yay for small steps!

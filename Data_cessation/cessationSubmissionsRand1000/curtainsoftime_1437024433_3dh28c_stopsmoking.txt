Quitting smoking for someone who really loves smoking

I've been smoking for five years now and I've always liked it. I've been able to kick a lot of habits that could be called addicting. No more weed, no problem. Alcohol, simple. But for some reason I can't shake cigarettes. Recently, I've become a pack a day smoker and it's really burning a hole in my pocket. I've realized I can't afford it any longer. But I need them. I go apeshit if I don't have cigarettes on me. They've become a vital part of my identity. I can't even remember a time when I didn't smoke and I can't imagine what it's like to be without them. Every time I make a decision to quit within an hour I can't handle it and I'm buying another pack. I feel like this is going to be the thing that will ruin me if I continue any longer. But I just can't quit.

Inspirational message.

A man approaches you and says, "I'm running a training camp. It's like a boot-camp that is going to be both physically and mentally challenging, perhaps more than you've ever experienced before. During this time, you can continue to work, be with your family, etc. The hardest part will last anywhere from a few weeks to a few months. You can drop out whenever you want. However, if you succeed, I will pay you Â£60 per week for the rest of your life. You will also permanently gain an increased sense of smell and sense of taste. You will smell better for the rest of your life. Your teeth will no longer be stained yellow. You will feel and be healthier. Finally, your physical endurance will significantly increase. You just need to make it through. Are you in?"

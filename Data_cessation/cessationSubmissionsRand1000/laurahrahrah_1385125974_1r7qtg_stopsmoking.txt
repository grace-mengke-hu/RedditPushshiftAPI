11 days away from being quit for a whole YEAR!

I am so excited. Quitting has been the best decision I ever made. Last night for the first time in 5 years, I ran for 2 miles straight, no breaks! My lungs feel amazing and are propelling me towards much needed weight loss. Quitting smoking was the first step in many positive changes in my life.

For those of you at the beginning of your journey, I wish you the best of luck - you can totally do it! Whenever I am at a party, or a bar, and I feel tempted to smoke, I remember how horrible it made me feel. How bad I smelled, how people judged me, and all of the weight I gained. Remembering this keeps me away from it all, and pushes me in the right direction. Also, reading this sub has helped me through times when all I really wanted was to smoke. Thank you for continued motivation!!

Today is my 3rd day and I'm so happy right now!

I've been sleeping weird, eating less (I know!) but making sure I walk everyday.  I've jones a couple of times seriously but fortunately for me it's in the wee hours (when I should be asleep) and I don't own a car and a store is far away!  I just say to myself *self?  you can smoke tomorrow if you still want to real bad*......I go back to sleep and feel so proud of myself and grateful!  Woohoo!

50 days in!

I finally made it to the 50 day mark, and I'm so happy! This has been such a rewarding experience, and I'm so glad that I've had an awesome support system. I celebrated by auditioning for my first musical in 5 years so hopefully I'll get a role and be able to reap the benefits of being smoke free!

Day 3. Is the chain broken already?

Day 3. Odd twinge of a craving but mostly forgot about smoking today. Is the chain broken already? 

I confess I may have a leg up. I previously quit smoking for 10 years. I know life is better without smoking. Stupidly slipped back in. Been having a bitch of a time getting past day 1. 

But here I am at Day 3. Feeling fine. 

Another advantage.  I was absolutely determined to quit. I thought long and hard about what I wanted and did not want in life. Smoking had to go, no question. 

I suppose there will be challenges still, but folks, it can be done, quickly and easily. Best.

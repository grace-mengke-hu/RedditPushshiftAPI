Day 3, Smoke Free

I'm on my third day of quitting and I'm feeling great. Quitting smoking has always been a really scary proposition, but I'm finding out, it is all about your mindset. If you allow yourself to be intimidated, it will roll you over...but i've taken a very determined approach to this from the beginning...i've just been telling myself, doesn't matter what happens, i just will NOT smoke...i have rejected the thought very quickly even when a cigarette enters my mind...i won't even entertain the idea..so the cravings haven't been that bad...i feel good about this! Thanks you guys!

Excuse I kept using.

I remember other times I tried to quit I would justify buying a new pack by saying that this isn't a good time in my life to quit and I would be better off doing it when I'm in a happier place.

I'm definitely not in a happier place right now, times are harder than they've ever been. But quitting goes hand in hand with this, it's causing me to take up new better habits and to be more productive.

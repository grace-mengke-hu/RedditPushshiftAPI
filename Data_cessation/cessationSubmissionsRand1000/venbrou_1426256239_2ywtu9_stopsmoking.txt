I want to quit, but can't for fear of what I become...

About a year ago, I decided to try quitting. Not for my health or even to save money, but because I wanted to know if I could. It lasted three days, and in that three days I became a monster. I had zero patience for anyone, and I acted like a complete asshole towards everyone who cared about me. I wanted to know if I could quit, and found out I couldn't.  
If anyone else has had this problem and overcome it, then please... Share your methods.

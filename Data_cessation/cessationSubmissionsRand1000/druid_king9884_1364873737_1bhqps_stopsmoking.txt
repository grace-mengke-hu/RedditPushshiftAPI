Yes, I just posted a couple days ago, but fuck it. Just found out my dad has emphysema after over 45 years of smoking. If you value your health and your loved ones, quit right now.

That is all, I don't have anything else to say. Search my history for what I posted to /r/depression. I'm going to drink. Fuck this shit. Fuck cigarettes. Fuck big tobacco taking my dad's life away from him!

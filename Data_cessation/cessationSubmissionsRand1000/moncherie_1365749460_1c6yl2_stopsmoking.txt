Marlboro Subliminal

I came across a youtube McDonald's commercial from the 70's which included a Marlboro subliminal.  What evil means they used to target & hook young people.  It makes me less judgmental of myself & I am thinking of writing an 'I hate you' letter to the tobacco co in my quit process.

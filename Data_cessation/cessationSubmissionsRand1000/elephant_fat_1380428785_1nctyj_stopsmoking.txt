I'm having a hard time here

Hey, /r/rstopsmoking. I'm having some trouble, and I was hoping someone could help me out.

So, the good news: the thought of never smoking again doesn't intimidate me at all, and I don't miss smoking.

Now, the bad news: for the last few weeks, I've been under more pressure and stress, and I've been very close to caving a few times. This is the busiest I've ever been, and I'm now doing schoolwork or other work literally all day, every day. I'm very nervous about some applications I have due, and the thought freaks me out so much I want to smoke just for five minutes of relief. I don't know what to do. I think I need to work with a psychologist (I have a HUGE anxiety problem), but I just don't have the time right now. 

Does anyone have any tips that can tide me over for two months or so? After that point, I'll be less stressed and can see a shrink, begin regular exercise again, etc. These things have been really helpful in the past, but I just don't have the time now.

Oh. This day.

Today marks one week since I quit. I woke up with a HORRIBLE attitude. I work evenings and don't get home until 11:30....don't go to sleep until 12:30/1am. My kids consistently wake me up at 6 am while my husband (who goes to bed at 10pm) sleeps until 730ish. Anyway, I probably said the f word 10 times to my 6 year old this morning. I'm watching my friend's 2 kids who I'm not very fond of (in addition to my 3 kids). I get everyone loaded in the minivan to take some of the kids to school and I realize I have a flat tire. Call my husband and he's a complete dick about it.  Now I'm stuck here with 5 whiney kids and I can't stop hating everything and yelling and being the meanest mom/babysitter in the history of the world. I want a fucking cigarette right now. Good thing I don't have any here and I have no way to escape my current personal hell. I'm stuck. And I'm going crazy.

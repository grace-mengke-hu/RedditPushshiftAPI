Day two !

After spending the first day fighting temptations and chewing on ice cubes woke up today with the sense of relief that the first 24 hours are done.It gave me a confidence that I am finally doing it.Today the temptation is easier to fight as now my resolve is getting stronger to pass another hour and then another.Rather than thinking that I have to spend another hour without smoking I am thinking I am another hour free of cigarettes and moving away from there nasty hold.
The most important part is that I have slipped a lot in the past the moment I got over confident.I thought I have broken my habit and one won't hurt.That one has always led to many others as I have an addiction to nicotine.This time I am determined to not get cocky and think I cam smoke for a day or two and then get back on my quit.It is way to hard even after slipping for a few days to get back on track.I need a lot of motivation and sometimes it does not came for another six months or a year.I am not risking that pattern and staying away from cigarettes or good. Many other people are going strong with there quits for more than over a decade and I am putting their examples in front of me.
I am spending a lot of time reading other posts and it is keeping my morale up. Onto day three.

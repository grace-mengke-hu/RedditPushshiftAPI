Repeated quitter repeated relapse...but I am going to do it.

I've smoked since 13. 20 a day for over 20 years now. I feel unhealthy and horrible. Mid thirties and I'm out of breath just walking to the shop. 

I have a few packs left from some duty frees, I'm going to smoke them and I'm swearing each day I will never buy another packet. I'm mentally preparing myself. And I am going to do it this time. 

It's been a massive part of my life for most of my life. But I hate it now. My health is shit. I can't afford it. I'm tired of it.

I've got a vape with the lowest level nicotine you can get before zero. 0.3mg. I'll use that if I get terrible cravings but apart from that, I'm going to go for cold turkey.

It's difficult cos my SO smokes, has no intention to quit and isn't very supportive of me succeeding. But this I'm doing for myself. If I quit next week i can save Â£500 by Christmas. It's money I need. But mostly my health is my priority.

Sorry for the monologue. I'm indoctrinating myself!

I came SO CLOSE yesterday but I held strong!

I’m bipolar and I have these panic moments that usually result in me giving into temptation. I’m trying to quit drinking too, doing pretty good but yesterday I had a couple mid-day beers. I’m stupid broke, I have like $9, I walked to the gas station, sat down and contemplated a moment, visited this subreddit. And from somewhere deep inside me was able to conjur the will to turn around! I have barely smoked, I need to stop before I start, so to speak. My brother and dad are both nicotine addicts for 30 and 7 years respectively. 

When I woke up this morning, I was so glad I didn’t have to make a hassle out of getting dressed, going out in the cold just to toxify my body and regret the $8 lost. Instead my lungs feel great, I’ve got my $8 and today should be easier. Thanks for reading.

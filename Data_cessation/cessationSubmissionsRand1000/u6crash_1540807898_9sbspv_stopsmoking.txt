My mother passed away. I'm just over 9 months quit.

My mother passed two weeks ago on October 13. She was only 55 and died from brain cancer which she had for just over three years. She never had a bad habit in her life and also fought and beat breast cancer when she was 34. I'm 37 now and didn't start smoking regularly until I was 32.

Dealing with her loss is difficult. I knew it would happen, but I still feel like it sneaked up on me. In some ways I feel like I haven't experienced an appropriate outpouring of grief. It's fall and it would feel so great to sit out on the back porch and smoke half a pack of cigarettes. It's so difficult not to because I have no kids to worry about, I can afford it, and I've had to watch my mother die at such a young age when she did *everything* right. About the only thing that kind of stops me is that I know she wouldn't want me to.

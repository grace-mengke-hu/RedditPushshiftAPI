A Fellow Redditor Gave Me The Idea To Do The Math and It's Unbelievable!

3 Months, 90 Days, 1,800 Cigarettes NOT smoked, $720 saved, 150 hours of life!!


It hasn't been easy but it's been worth it! I'm proud of myself, I feel and look better and one of my favorite things about quitting, smell better! Never looking back!

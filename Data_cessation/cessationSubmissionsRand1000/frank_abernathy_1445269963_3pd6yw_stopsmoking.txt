Day 2, first day at work

So here is my story. I smoked ~1 pack a day starting when I was 19 (I am 26 now), and was an occasional smoker since I was 14. I quit this past winter, in no small part due to a lot of help and support from my girlfriend. 

It lasted about 4 months until summer hit and it was porch drinking weather, and one of my best friends came to visit from Germany, where he is living, and had picked up a solid smoking habit. 

I spent the next few months hiding it from my girlfriend, feeling shitty, etc. This weekend she found a cigarette butt and confronted me that she had known all along and was very hurt. I felt terrible, obviously, and told her I would quit for real this time.

That was on Saturday night. Yesterday was pretty easy but today is getting tough. It's my first day back at work and I have a fair amount of down time. Any tips?

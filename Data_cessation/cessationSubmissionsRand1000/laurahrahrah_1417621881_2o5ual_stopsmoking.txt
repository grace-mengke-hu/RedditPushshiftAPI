Today marks TWO YEARS! Woohoo! Thought I would share my stats for motivation!

So happy to have made it to 2 years. These are my stats according to my QuitNow! app, this is based on when I smoked 20 cigs a day at $7.25/pack:

Day quit smoking: December 3rd, 2012

Days without smoking: 730 days

Cigarettes not smoked: **14,609**

Money Saved: **$5,660.99**

Time Saved: 60 Days, 20 hours, 54 minutes

So I encourage all of you to keep it up! Think of the days and dollars you'll be saving!

WOOHOO!!!

8 months totally nicotine and cigarette FREE!! No longer a slave to nicotine and smoking. Huge thanks to Mr, Allan Carr and his amazing book. Withdrawal was so minor, cravings were almost non-existant. It can be easy to quit, even after 40 years and 1.5 packs a day! Also thanks to everyone here, from the success stories, to the relapsers, all modivation to me to end my slavery to nicotine.

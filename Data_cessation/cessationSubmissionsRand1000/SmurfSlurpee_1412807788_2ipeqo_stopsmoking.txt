23 hours so far.

It has been 23 hours since my last cigarette. I've quit in the past, but I always knew back then that I "wasn't really done" with smoking. This time I actually feel committed, and other than being a little manic, I'm doing well so far.

Here's to the coming smoke-free decades of my life!

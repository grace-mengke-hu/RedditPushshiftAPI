Making Another Go At It

Recently, my mom found out i've been smoking (hid it from her for 3 years). she's told me all she wants for mothers day and her birthday (also in may) is for me to quit, and since i've tried a few times i figure this is a good reason to make another go at it. My plan at this point is to do it at the end of the month, i have a week off (was going to use it to tour with my band so those plans were canceled so i pretty much just have a free week now), i work a customer service job so i want to try and get through the whole being irritated and pissy stuff as much as i can before i get back to work. do pre-determined dates work? has anyone had any experience with this? Can anyone offer me some advice?

I had a relapse yesterday and since then I have no cravings

I smoked a few last night along with some quality red wine. I couldn't resist. I know, weak of me.

But the craziest thing happened: I don't have any cravings when I would have them almost daily. I plan to stay away from tobacco in the future but I just thought it is weird that cravings are gone so fast.

Thanks for reading.

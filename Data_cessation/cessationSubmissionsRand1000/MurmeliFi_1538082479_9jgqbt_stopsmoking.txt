Hidradenitis suppurativa and smoking/quitting

I'm not sure if I have it, but if I do, it's not the most severe form of it. But still bothers me. My husband had it so bad his other armpit was surgically removed. Mine are little boils which hide under the skin and cause pain for a long time before I'm able to empty them. For a long time I thought they came from shaving. It was one of the reasons I wanted to quit, I know it could be 1000 worse and I don't want to experience the same as my husband did.

Since it's smokers' disease, I thought maybe some of you knows what happens after quitting? Will I get rid of it or not? Tried to google but didn't find an answer.

Don't know if it's a sinus infection or effects from quitting

I'll try not to be gross here. I developed a bad cold about a day before I stopped smoking. Although I feel MUCH better, I'm still coughing quite a bit and have a runny nose. The nose stuff is clear, the coughing stuff is...not clear. 

I don't want to get loaded up on antibiotics if this is just from smoking but the fact that I had that nasty cold makes me question it. Any advice?

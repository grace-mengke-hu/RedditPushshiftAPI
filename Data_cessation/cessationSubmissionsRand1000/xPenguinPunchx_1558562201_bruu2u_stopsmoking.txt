Nicotine-free vaping on Day 4

So I’m on day 4.5 of no smoking. It’s been a lot easier than day 2-3 but I’m finding I’m really sad about not smoking. I don’t have any desire to go back to smoking cigarettes , I don’t feel I want nicotine , it’s just the act of smoking that I miss. It’s almost made me cave a few times . I’m wondering if it would be stupid to buy some nicotine -free vape juice . I really disbelieve in vaping nicotine after quitting , I’ve had a bad experience last time I quit . I got addicted to the pen and eventually returned to smoking cigs so I definitely do not want to start that again . I’m just thinking if I smoke some without nicotine just to lessen the blow for a few weeks maybe that will help keep me away from buying real cigarettes . 

Any opinions or experiences ? I’m also concerned this is just junky thinking and it might make it all worse for me in the end . 

Thanks!

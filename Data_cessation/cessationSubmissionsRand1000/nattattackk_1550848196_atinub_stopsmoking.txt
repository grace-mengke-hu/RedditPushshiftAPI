Day 19 no smoking

for today’s mission, my app asked me to write down things that worked so far and why they did to help me stop smoking. 
And I do actually find it helpful and hope someone else does too! 

Patches - it really, really helped take the edge off . I just ran out of them today but I’ll probably buy the lowest dosage now and keep it up. It makes it much, much easier to say no, and it doesn’t mean you’re a failure! Anything to stop smoking. And for me the hardest thing to break is the habit which you’ll need to work on. If you have the physical craving subdued, you’ll be able to break the psychological ones much easier.

It’s also teaching me to manage stress differently.  Not having such a strong physical pull makes this much easier. I feel stronger, I feel healthier, and the mental habits that controlled me no longer do!

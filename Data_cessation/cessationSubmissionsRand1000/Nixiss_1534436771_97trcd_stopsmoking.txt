First step, second time quitting

I’m having a shitty time collecting my thoughts. 

I’ve smoked for 9 years - last year I got pregnant and quit for 5 months, then we lost our son during the second trimester. It was easy then because the smell/act of smoking made me want to puke. But then, with all that had happened, I immediately went back to smoking. I regret that so much. I’m kicking myself in the ass. 

Now it’s time to try again and I am feeling so overwhelmed with guilt.

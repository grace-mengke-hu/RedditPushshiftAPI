Another quit attempt starting 1st October

Yes I fucked up. Am back to smoking for last few months post quitting successfully for a month not sure why though. But yes this is it. Am gonna do it again and this time for the lifetime. 

My body won't suffocate anymore. Starting 1st October I start my quit journey hopefully a successful one this time. 

Need support from everyone out there. Thanks for the help and support last time guys. It really helped then I left reddit and joined hands with ciggrate. Shit man. Shit. Not this time. 

1st October it is. All the best to me and everyone out there. Love you all.

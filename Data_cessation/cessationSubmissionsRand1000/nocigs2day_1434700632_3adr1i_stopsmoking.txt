100 days came and went and I didn't even notice!

If I can do this anybody can, I smoked cigarettes for 37 years, at times I wanted to kill somebody at times I wanted to sneak off like a little kids to smoke behind the shed other times I thought I was going crazy but I've not smoked for over 3 months now and I feel miles better about myself and smokers stink.

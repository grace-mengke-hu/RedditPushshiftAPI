I'M SO BORED

I always get bored at night. Lately I've been getting up super early, so by the time 9pm rolls around I'm exhausted and don't want to stay up that much longer anyway.

Weekends are always different. I did a lot of stuff today, but now I feel lazy. I'm in that mode of "It's Saturday I want to go out," but I know I really can't because I have $3 to spend.

It's these moments, where I decide to do nothing, that I seem to sink deeper into my chair. I wonder what I'm actually going to do tonight.

I worked out today. I cleaned, I read all I could. I played hours of vidya, cooked food... everything I said I was going to do. Now I'm just sitting around bored as hell, not wanting to actually physically do anything but wanting to mentally have *something*.

Boredom is a huge trigger for me it seems and I'm not quite sure what to do... because I've done **everything** I said I was going to do today. And I think I hurt my shoulder/back working out so I'm totally like "Oh man I should just rest... and like... smoke cigarettes because they'll make me feel better."

Are there things I want to do in general? Sure, I want to write more and learn guitar. But my motivation to do anything is lacking right now. Doing something just for the fact that it's going to occupy me seems so... unfavorable, and I have no idea why.

Even just making this post helped, though.

ANYWAY I'M BORED AND THAT'S A TRIGGER
What you guys do when you're bored?

1 Month Blues?

I've been going strong, and have retained my desire to be a non-smoker for the past 39 days, but the past 5 or 6 days I've been hit with truly awful cravings.  I've worked through them and they've disappeared pretty quickly, but I've seen quite a few posts on this thread over the past few months from people who did well until month 2 or 3 and then relapsed.

To those of you who relapsed, and those of you who made it past: what was your experience with late on-set cravings, and how did you get past them? I'm doing okay so far, but for some reason they're just so much more awful then the ones I experienced when I was first starting out!

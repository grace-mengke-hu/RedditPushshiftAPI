4 days 6 hours in

to be honest guys, i'm a little nervous.

i'm four days in, and what always, ALWAYS happens when i see my best friend, who smokes and doesn't take me quitting seriously, is when i find myself smoking again.

that being said, i'm seeing her tonight, and just need some advice. how do you guys say no to smoking when your friends don't take your quitting seriously and almost seem to encourage you to smoke?!

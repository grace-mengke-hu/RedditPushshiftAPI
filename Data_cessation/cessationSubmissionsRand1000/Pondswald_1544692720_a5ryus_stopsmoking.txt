Got some questions - answers anyone?

I recently posted a very long post about wanting to quit in this sub, and you all gave me such great responses! So thanks for that! 

However, I have some questions. I haven't quit yet (I got a call with a coach today, first one. So was waiting - looking forward - to that), but now I'm doubting when is the right time to stop and how.

The obvious answer is NOW, and I know that. There is one slight problem I have though: all of my friends (and boyfriend, but outside) smoke. Literally all of them. This weekend I have two parties - one is the 30th birthday of a friend, the other is the second birthday of my niece - and everyone will be smoking, inside their houses. If I quit today/tomorrow, that will mean I'm on day 2/3 on Saturday, when the first party is. 

I'm kind of scared I'm making this impossible for myself by quitting right before a party where literally everyone will be blowing smoke in my face (not on purpose of course, they're not assholes). For two days straight. So I'm wondering if it's best to quit today/tomorrow (depending on my convo with my coach) or on Monday. I don't really want to put it off, but I also don't want to set myself up for failure. And skipping the parties is not really an option (especially the one of my niece. Also, I really don't WANT to skip that one). What are your thoughts?

The other question is about nicotine patches. I bought a pack (to give myself an extra push to quit already) but haven't used them yet, obviously. I know what they do, but I'm wondering if anyone has experiences with the patches and can tell me if they really do help. I get that it's no miracle thing. It's not like all the cravings will immediately go away. But a little help could be nice.

So what are your thoughts? And thanks for reading the long post, again. I promise, my future posts will be shorter ;).

I'm Baaaack.

For the umpteenth, gazillionith time.  20yr, 1-2 pack per day smoker. I've read Allen Carr (several times), I've tried patches and gum and lozenges and cold turkey and vaping. I've quit for boyfriends, babies, my husband, even "myself." I've had several successful-ish quits.  The longest I've made it was about 10 months. This time I'm going with lozenges as my main NRT and vaping for when the cravings are THROUGH THE ROOF.  I know cold turkey is the primary approach taken by this subreddit but I've never made it past 3 or 4 days going cold turkey.

Anyway, I think the big difference this time is that I really, truly am quitting for myself.  But not my current self.  My self in 10 years or 20 years.  My future self.  

If I try quitting for my current self I will always give in because my current self wants that immediate gratification.  She wants to feel sane.  She wants to feel "normal."  My current self just wants not to deal with quitting smoking.  

My self 20 years from now doesn't want to have COPD or lung cancer.  She doesn't want to be carrying around an oxygen tank.  She doesn't want to have a stroke or a heart attack.  She wants to be playing with her grandchildren and living life! 

Wish me luck.  Hoping I finally found my reason and that I can hold onto this when things get tough.  I'm going to keep living my life like normal and powering through, one craving and trigger at a time.  Here's to being a non-smoker. Forever.

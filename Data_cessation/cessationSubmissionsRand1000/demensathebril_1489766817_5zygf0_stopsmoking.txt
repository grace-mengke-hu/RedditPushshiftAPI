Airplanes are no longer the enemy

Today I'm flying for a couple hours to go visit family... And guess what? I'm not going to be super anxious when the plane lands to get off the plane and run outside to smoke a cigarette!

I'm almost to 100 days and while sometimes I *want* a cigarette, I no longer feel like I need one ever. I'm so proud of myself for kicking this addiction and I can't wait until I kick this cough. I already feel so much better without the constant desire for nicotine, I can't wait until my lungs have healed more.

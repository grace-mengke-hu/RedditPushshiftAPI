Fucked up

Made it 3 weeks. Had terrible day at work yesterday and today and smoked 2 cigarettes today. Been off of my antidepressants for 2 days because doctor won’t refill until I see him. Can’t get in to see him for 10 more days. I feel lost and like a complete failure. I am going to start over, but I am feeling very weak. Don’t know if I’m going to make it. FUCK!!!

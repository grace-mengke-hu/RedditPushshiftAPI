I've been off this thread for a while because I thought I was safe..

And I totally was :)
I haven't wanted to smoke since week one and it feels amazing.

I'm currently on holiday with a friend I haven't seen much of since I quit (she started a new full time job) and used to smoke with all the time. That was practically how we bonded.
She's a social smoker more than anything, barely smokes until she's out with mates or drinking or something.
We got to the hostel late last night in Barcelona, were given a balcony room and told we were allowed to smoke there. I said "almost makes me wish I still smoked, I'd have loved this"
Turns out I friggin love the balcony anyway, and I like it a lot more without smoke in my lungs.
So she went and bought smokes, she was smoking while we chatted and drunk on the balcony and I had the familiar "ugh" response to smoking but haven't been douchey about it. She even got me to hold her fag while she checked on her food and I wasn't remotely interested in taking a drag.
I feel like the me as a smoker is a million miles away. It was only 41 days and I can't believe I ever smoked :)
Keep going, newbies, this is such a good feeling.
And ALLLEN CARR - can't recommend highly enough. I quit for 6 months before and never felt truly pleased I was a non smoker. This would definitely have broken me back then - in fact a lesser incident did. But now I'm really genuinely happy about being a non smoker and I love it :)

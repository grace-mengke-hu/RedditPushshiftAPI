Don't let yourself get hungry

Just a reminder friends, hunger is almost an impossible trigger. And yet so easy to prevent!

We have to look after ourselves. As soon as you feeling a bit hungry, address it, snack, whatever. Don't let it get worse. 

I just had a close call - but glad I have worked out another trigger before I fell. Won't make that mistake again.

Question on Champix

My husband has now been on Champix for 11 days.  He was told they would kick in between 8 and 10 days.  He is now on day 11 and has no desire to stop smoking.  He's feeling really disheartened.  These were his last hope, nothing else has worked for him.  How soon have they worked for other people?

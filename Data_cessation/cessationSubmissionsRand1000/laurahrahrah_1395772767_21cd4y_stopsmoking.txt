Just want to share an added benefit of quitting that I've noticed

As I'm writing this post, it's been 477 days since my last cigarette. While it isn't easy and I still think about it occasionally, the benefits of quitting have been overwhelming. However, recent events have brought to light another benefit that I hadn't thought of before quitting. 

I quit smoking in Dec of 2012 and quit my job at the time in March 2013. I wasn't very happy at my last job, I felt like my coworkers didn't like me very much, I didn't bond with my supervisor or manager at all, and I was mostly miserable and unmotivated. When I started my new job, I had a fresh start:

-No one labeled me or thought of me as a smoker

-I was no longer taking hourly smoke breaks which each lasted 10 min

-I no longer had a crutch or distraction from my work

My job performance and others' perception of me in this new job is exponentially better than at my last job where I was the smoker. I find that I have been working a lot harder, more efficiently, and I'm receiving a lot of praise from management because of it. 

Sorry for the wall of text, but I just wanted to share this with those of you who might be looking for added motivation. Good luck to you all!!

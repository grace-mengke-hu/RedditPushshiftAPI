I feel like I should quit smoking, but I really enjoy it?

I've been smoking daily for maybe 6 months now. I really don't smoke much, probably 4 on a weekday and 5-6 on a weekend. I feel like I should quit, but I really enjoy smoking. If I can maintain my current level of use, is it really that bad? I'm just not sure what to do.

Okay I slipped up and had a cigarette today. Feeling kind of crummy about it.

I slipped up today, and despite telling myself I wouldn't I ended up buying a pack and having a cigarette.  I have just been stressed out with work and personal issues.  I started craving this morning and it just got worse during the day.  I finally cracked this afternoon.  

I talked to my boyfriend about quitting, but he doesn't seem quite ready to quit.  I don't want to pressure him, but I really want a partner to quit with me.

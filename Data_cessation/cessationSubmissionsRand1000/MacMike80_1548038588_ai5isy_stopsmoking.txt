Finishing day 20!!

Day 20 about to be finished!! This is awesome making it this far.  I feel better, I’m breathing better, smell better, more energy, all the cliches, and a shit load of money has been saved... it’s just a fantastic feeling.  I did have a few cravings today, especially when I was driving back from a few hours away from home, but I took some deep breathes and they passed.  It’s getting so much easier!!  The mission on the app was good too- “sit back, relax, deep breathes, and think about how well you’ve done.”  Thinking about it made me feel giddy!!
Quitting smoking can be done.  For the people just starting it can be done!!  Not another puff, no matter what!!
You can do it!!

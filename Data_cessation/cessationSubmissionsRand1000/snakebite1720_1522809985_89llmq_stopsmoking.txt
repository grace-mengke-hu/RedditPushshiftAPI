Got a party this Friday

So here's the deal I am almost.into say 4 after relapsing twice in last 20 days. Now on coming Friday there is a full night team outing which I can't avoid given I am the manager of the team. 

There will be drinks and all I wanna enjoy drinking but am afraid that that if I got drunk I might end up smoking. Need suggestions and help how to do and what to do to have fun and staying away from it. 

Though for now am firm I won't smoke but we all know after alcohol things happen. Will try to limit alcohol consumption as well. 

Please help I don't wanna relapse again.

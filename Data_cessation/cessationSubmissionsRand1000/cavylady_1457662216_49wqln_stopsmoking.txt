Day 1. Doing fine. But how do I deal with my smoking boyfriend?

So I quit for 11 years. Last summer I decided I would have one cigarette. Here we are 9 months later. Smoking became my crutch for stress - even though it actually makes me more stressed because I feel so afraid of the effect on my health. I am quitting with gum which works for me. I dont have bad cravings at all. But I have no idea how to deal when my smoker boyfriend is around. Any ideas? I really need and want to quit!

Weird nerve feelings? Anyone have this?

I’m almost two weeks smoke free and for about two or three days I’ve had the weirdest feelings in the back of my knee and in the arch of my foot. It’s hard to explain but it almost feels like a... nerve spasm? Like sort of a tingly feeling, a very faint discomfort, and a subtle need to jerk the parts around like a reflex test at a doctor will make you feel. I know that’s a very weird description but maybe if someone has experienced it they’ll know what I mean. 

Just wondering if this has happened to anyone in their quit journey—like it could be part of my circulation returning to normal? Thoughts?

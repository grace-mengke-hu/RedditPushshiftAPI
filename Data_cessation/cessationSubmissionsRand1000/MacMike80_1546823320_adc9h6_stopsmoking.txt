Day 6 was trouble

Had a little fiasco w one of my employees that turned in to a stressful situation.  Basically I had to shut the email notifications off on my phone so I wouldn’t see them anymore.  Also, slugged about 10 bottles of water in 5 minutes. I didn’t smoke as much as I wanted to... gotta go pee now.

Caught the junky in my brain trying to capitalize on some hard times today

My car broke down three weeks ago. Found out today it will cost 1/2 a months salary to repair. In the meantime I'm taking cabs to work. My refrigerator just up and died. I have some pretty expensive commitments coming up and I'm just a Lil stressed today. 
So the junky in my brain has quietly been at work. I saw a cigarette lying on the sidewalk earlier burning. Only a couple puffs had been taken. I wouldn't even need a lighter the junky whispered. It smells really good the junky whispered. No one has to know the junky whispered. NO! I said. 
Later I was walking the dog thinking about riding my bike. You should ride to the store and grab a pack of smokes the junky said, it's all downhill on the way home. I even had a vision of riding home one hand on the handlebars, one hand holding a cigarette. For a moment this line of thinking seemed reasonable. Then I told the junky to shut his fucking trap. 
While I don't get those hardcore cravings anymore I do find these thoughts creeping in on occasion.  
Never let your guard down! Not one more puff!!!! Ever!!!!

Made it to day 3! And I have some questions about physical side effects.

I got a runny nose starting yesterday but intensifying today. I woke up and had to immediately wipe my nose. I also have mild nausea and sweating. 
At first I thought I was getting sick but I really think it's the lack of cigarettes. Is my body flushing out all the toxic crap I've been inhaling? 
I also have a little throat tenderness and of course am coughing up a lot of phlegm. 

Sorry for the TMI. Also, thanks for helping me get to day 3!!! In my mind it's always been my biggest hurdle.

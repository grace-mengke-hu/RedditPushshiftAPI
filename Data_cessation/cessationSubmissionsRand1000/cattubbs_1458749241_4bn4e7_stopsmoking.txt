Gross Question...

So I had quit for two years, and a week before my two year mark I thought I could have just one. My 2 year mark would have been June 1 2015. So I have been smoking again since then and quit 19 days ago. When I quit last time I was still smoking pot, this time I had quit smoking pot about 2 weeks before I quit cigs. For the last 19 days I have been hacking up some of the nastiest stuff! I thought I was getting sick but it's brown, not green. Do ya'll think it's because I quit pot at the same time? I didn't have as much lung clear out as I seem to have now when I quit before. I can't seem to not be coughing shit up. Maybe with the quitting pot and cigs it's worse? Has anyone else had this experience where it just won't stop?

Stopped as of Today!

Been meaning to quit recently, just never found the *right time* to do so.  My pack had one left, I had only been having a cig or two a day for the past 2 weeks, so it was decided.  January 6th I have officially quit smoking.  I read a post a couple days ago about how OP was going to go have a smoke by sneaking one behind his GF but than realized that he was actually **quitting** and not *~~trying~~ to quit*.  It really hit home to me, and I believe in thinking what you are doing so I keep telling myself **I am quitting**.  No longer shall I ~~try~~.  I also wrote on a piece of paper what smoking has cost me, and I killed it with fire using my last butt.  I will be turning 22 on the 21st of this month, and I hope by my 23rd birthday I will have completely ridden myself of this habit.  Looking forward to being a really big dick for a couple of days, but a positive dick!

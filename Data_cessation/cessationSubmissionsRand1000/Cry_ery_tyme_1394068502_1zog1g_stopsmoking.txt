A question for you eCig quitters.

How well did going the electronic route go? I've been on the sub for about 6 months now and I've failed every single time. I went for a month without a cigarette a while back, and I felt great. But I succumbed to alcohol and had a moment of weakness which put me right back in to the cycle.

I've been working out and doing yoga almost every day, and it makes me hate myself even more for not smoking. I can't breathe deeply and my chest begins to hurt when I do cardio. I've been a pack a day for the last 3 years and I need some serious help. And suggestions?

P.S. - When I went my one month, it was because of you. I went on a fraternity trip with my brothers and almost gave in, but I posted on here and you all gave me some tremendous support. And it worked. So thank you all again.

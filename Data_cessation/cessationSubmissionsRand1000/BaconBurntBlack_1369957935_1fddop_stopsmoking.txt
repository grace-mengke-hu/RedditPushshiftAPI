Day 4 questions

I am having an okay time handling my cravings, and I feel determined not to relapse. That said, I have boundless energy now that comes in weird spurts.  It's good a lot of the time, but half the time its nervous energy that makes it hard for me to focus or lie down to go to sleep. Is this normal? When can I expect to normalize?

I keep resetting my badge

and I'm sick of it. I really want this to be the last time but I can never seem to get past 6 or 7 days. I have never been more disappointed in myself over anything. I feel like such a slave to these cigarettes. I am stronger and better than my addiction, you all have shown me that through your experience, strength and hope. I really hope I beat it this time, but all i have is today . .

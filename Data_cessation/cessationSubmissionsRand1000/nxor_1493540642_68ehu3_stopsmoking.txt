Thought it was over

16 days in and resetting.  I was drunk and a bit depressed and then it happened. Longest I have ever gone without smoking, and I really thought it was all over. I had been out at a party before and I had no cravings, so I don't know what happened. This morning I was at the verge of tears because of another failure, and since my parents are coming next week I was so looking forward to them being proud of me and I cannot bring myself to request a new badge already.

Just had to get that off my chest!

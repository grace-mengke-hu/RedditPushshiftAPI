When do the mental cravings end?

Today marks my 3rd week smoke and nicotine free! Yayy

But my cravings throughout last week were stronger than the previous two combined! It’s as though my brain is starting to realize I’m serious about this quit. I never did a ceremonial last cigarette or anything.. I just was hungover one day and didn’t want any. When I had made it 3 days or so I just decided fuck it, I’ll stick with it.

But this last week was brutal. And I think it’s because I introduced having a couple alcoholic drinks into my social life again. Nothing crazy, just some wine one day and mimosas another.

But seriously, for over an hour or more, all I did was think about going home and smoking a cigarette. I was cuddling with my girlfriends and you’d think that would keep those thoughts away.. but no. All I could think about was smoking, it invaded my thoughts entirely.

I’ve skipped going out a couple of these nights because just as soon as I decided I wanted to hit the clubs, all I could think was how it was okay to have a couple cigarettes. You know, my brain was rationalizing everything away.

“Oh, you can just be the girl that has a cigarette or two or three while she drinks. It isn’t a big deal, and is totallly sustainable.” 

Like, NO brain! Please! 

When do these thoughts go away? Do they ever? 

Or do you just sorta become the smoker that fights herself every night to not smoke. Because it’s hard to enjoy things when all I’m doing is fantasizing about sparking up. Ughhh

At least we made it to 3 weeks y’all! ✨💖

I'm about to slip and I don't really care...

So I just got a notic from the city department that I'm almost 10k in dept and my paycheck is gonna be confiscated/pawned.
I'm a nervous wreck right now and just want to smoke, I know that cigarette won't help me in any way but i'm severly depressed right now and just can't see any hope right now.. I'm not sure if I should just screw it and smoke since everything going down anyway.

Edit: Thank you all very very much for all your kind words. 
I love you all for keeping me from lighting that smoke. I really appreciate the time everyone of you took to reply to my post. 
I know I sound whiny but it was just too much for me in that moment. 
Thanks a lot to everyone here, I know I can keep going despite any problems wich may occur. 
Again thanks to every single one of you!

Yesterday at work....

I was juicing oranges at the bar, when one of our members stepped outside and I noticed him smoking.   I leaned over to my co worker and said, EWWW, he Smokes.  Gross,  At that moment I really felt like a non smoker!!!  People probably used to think the same of me!  Iâ€™d call this a win!

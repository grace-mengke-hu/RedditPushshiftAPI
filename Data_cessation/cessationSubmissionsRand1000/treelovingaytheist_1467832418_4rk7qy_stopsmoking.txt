So many great perks to being a non-smoker, but forgot how great this is...

Have been doing some traveling for the first time since I quit, and it is so great to fly without worrying if I'll be lucky enough to have some nasty, smelly smoking "lounge" during a layover--  Or if I'll have to wait until both flights are over and grind my teeth while people are taking forever to get off the plane when all I want to do is run outside and smoke two in a row. (Uggh nasty)  .  It is SO  nice to not have ANY of that smoking related stress  on top of having to deal with all the pains in the ass that flying provides anyway..    Oh, and I saved enough from quitting to pay for two trips this summer!  :-)

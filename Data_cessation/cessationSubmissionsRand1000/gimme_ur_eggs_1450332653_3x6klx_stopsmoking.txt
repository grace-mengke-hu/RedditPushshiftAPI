I've read Alan Carr's book 3 times, still failing miserably.

A little about myself...

I'm 35 years old. I smoked my first cig at 15. That was 20 years ago. 

It all started in high school because to me, smoking looked very cool. Now that illusion is gone - smoking looks like weakness/sickness (though once in a while, I go back to thinking that it looks cool for a small percentage of people, including myself. I'm aware that the brainwashing is deep, though I should know better)

 I've read Alan Carrs book 3 times (so there is no advice from his book you could give me that would help me - I'm very familiar with all his points), seen the vid 3 times, listened to the audio book, thought it changed me and that I was gonna quit.. It really resonated with me, but for some reason, I have failed quitting so many times. 

I try to quit every fucking day and it's wearing me out. I meditate for an hour everyday, I've been jogging twice a day, but still can't handle the cravings, especially in the mornings. I really hate smoking. Still can't figure out why I'm failing so miserably. 

That being said, we all need to rise above this. We are seriously wasting so much time talking/thinking about smoking. It's time to say goodbye, and FUCK YOU to ciggies!! Seriously, fuck you!!! Ahhh the misery/guilt/self-loathing... I'm ready to fight once again for health/peace/joy/victory over this insidious fucking poison that has high-jacked my brain.

Soon 2 months nicotine free

Currently I am on a 10 day hiking trip. I have done half a dozen of these in the past few years. I used to split my day into 1 hour chunks to have a smoke break, to rest, to enjoy the surroundings etc,  and after a hard day of 25 or 30km in the backcountry, in the subsequent euphoria I could easily smoke 5 or 6 before going to sleep. 

I was honestly afraid to make this trip since I thought I wouldn't enjoy the experience without cigs. This is a major hobby of mine so the thought of it having  been enjoyable just because those smoke breaks were always earned "the hard way" was depressing.

Indeed I have been proven wrong, it works just as well without cigs.

An interesting perspective 

I was talking with my girlfriend tonight about how I wanted a cigarette, but due to my different mindset this time I wouldn't have one. I was saying I didn't know if my cravings would ever pass. Not complaining...I've learned how to be stronger than the cravings. 

She said "you know...even if you had one, you'll still have cravings later tonight and tomorrow. The only difference is your streak will be broken."

Sound advice from a nonsmoker! Just a little encouragement for those who, like me, are more and more proud of their streak with each passing day.

Smoking me is a distant memory, 100 days

I smoked a pack and a half a day.  Every smoke break I chain smoked two.  In 100 days, I've not smoked 3000, that's just insane.  15 years of that.

It doesn't matter if it's hard or not, make quitting the most important thing in your life until it's not.  Being chained to an addiction is an awful existence.  Just follow your thoughts through the day, that addiction is driving everything you do.

We all had a day one.  We didn't believe we could really do it.  Yet here we are.

And thanks /r/stopsmoking, you guys are awesome!

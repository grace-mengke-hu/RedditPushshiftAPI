Became stupid after quitting?

Did anybody here feel they lost majorly on brain function for some time after quitting? I quit with vaping, but I felt very forgetful and incapable of any mental work after quitting. I remember once going out of the house,  it was such a pain and mentally taxing process to lock the two exits to my house. It was as if I was stoned out of my mind.

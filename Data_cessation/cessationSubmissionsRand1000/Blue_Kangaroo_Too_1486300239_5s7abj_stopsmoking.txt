What is the deal with down-voting on here?

Here we are, a whole bunch of vulnerable people. Some going through emotional hell right now. Some floating on the elation of being free. So why are there people out there bringing us down? I've seen really great posts where people are rightly proud of their achievements to not smoke. Posts where people are just starting out and are doing it with a mixture of excitement and apprehension. AND THEY'RE GETTING DOWN-VOTED?! We should be encouraging each other, respecting the differences in our quitting experiences and looking to help and support each other. Do people not realise how demoralising it is to see their post has been down voted? 

I don't get it! Quitting is hard enough without bringing each other down. If you're feeling crappy, don't take it out on a stranger. Bigging people up makes you feel better than bringing them down and that's a fact!

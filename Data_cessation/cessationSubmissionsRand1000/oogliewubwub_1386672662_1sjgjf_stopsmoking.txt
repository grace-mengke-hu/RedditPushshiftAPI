Day 1

I know what I'm up against. I've quit smoking several times in the past; the longest for 3 months. 
What always gets me is my subconscious saying "Oh, c'mon, you can have  just one".
This time I'm approaching it differently - I'm approaching it as a serious, life threatening addiction. I'm approaching it as if I were a heroin addict or alcoholic. 
I'm pretty sure I'm going to be a total asshole about the entire situation, though.
Wish me luck.

I find sunflower seeds helpful, maybe you will too?

Especially if I'm drinking I find sunflower seeds help me cope with the desire to do something to keep my hands and mouth busy (pls. no stupid comments) Peanuts work as well. Think of how good breaking open peanut shells is when at a tense baseball game! 

Thing is we have addiction to beat but also routines which  relieve stress for us ex-smokers. 

Hope this is helpful. :)

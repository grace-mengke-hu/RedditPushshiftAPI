How long after quitting are you unlikely to relapse?

Tonight at 9 PM I will be one week smoke and nicotine free. It's been tough, but not nearly as tough as I was afraid it was going to be, or has hard as I remember past attempts at smoking being. I feel amazing and my girlfriend/coworkers all think I'm a total stud for quitting and not becoming a maniac. 

I'm still worried.  I've made it this far in the past a bunch of times and caved. I'm really worried that I'll make it three weeks or three months, then just drop my guard after a few beers, bum a cigarette, and be right back to where I started.

It seems stupid when I think about it now, but I once quit for 4 years, only to smoke one drunken night at a wedding. After another 4 months of bumming off of people, I was back up to 30 a day. 

So, my question to the people who quit: When did you feel like you could trust yourself again?

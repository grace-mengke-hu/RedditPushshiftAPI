Nicotine Vapers... Did you notice physical improvements?

I'm wondering if former vapers feel improvements in physical aspects such as: blood circulation, throat mucus coming out, nasal, breathing , etc

Just asking as I know that cigarettes inject carbon monoxide into the bloodstream. But what about Vaping.  It seems more mysterious as to what kind of effects you would notice on your body. 

We were still breathing substances to reach our bloodstream but they just happen not to be the thousands of chemicals in cigarettes. Yet, I am wondering how the nicotine+flavour+proplyene glycol+vegetable glycerine affected your body health wise.  Have you noticed any improvements health wise?  What changes do you feel/see physically?

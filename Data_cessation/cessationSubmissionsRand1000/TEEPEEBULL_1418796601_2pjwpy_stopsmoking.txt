Here comes Christmas and the Holidays.... such a bunch of stereotypical triggers assocaited with this time of year. Are we perared? Here's the scoop..

Perared..WTF? Prepared
and I guess I can't edit the title...  


So here comes the family/holiday- pressures!!!!

The deadlines, gift phobia, money woes,...

Definite big time : parents- siblings- spouses- in-laws confrontations, dysfunctional family bullshit!

All the RIGHT REASONS to self-destruct(I mean, smoke)who could blame us right now, if we had a moment of weakness? Right?

Of course that moment of weakness will lead to resuming FULL BLOWN ADDICTION again. For sure, proven fact, it's a matter of time.

'Tis The season, the cold, the tree, the TV shows and movies, the smells , the feelings. - all associated with the "PAST HABIT"

It's going to take strength of purpose, and detemination to continue!!

If you have already started your quit journey, ahead of the "New Year Resolution" showboat parade(LOL)...brace yourself..

There's a reason most quits (about 95%) don't make it past 1 year.

It's partially because of milestones like this season, the family pressures and interactions, the brain/behavior associations. We have programmed our selves to react to THOUSANDS of stimulous, thousands of feelings...by smoking. By reaching for a cigarette when we feel lonely, left out, hurt, deprived, happy, relieved, ...were these really the reasons? How could a single same cigarette address such a different range of issues?

Think about it....

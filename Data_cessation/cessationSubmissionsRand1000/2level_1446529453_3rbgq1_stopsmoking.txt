Three months smoke free, 2,040 cigs down, 530.4 â‚¬ saved!

I still have some problems sleeping but jogging is helpful. I have a craving about once a week but it does not bothers me much.

On the plus side, I have much more energy, I even get anxious if I don't do more stuff! I am  able to concentrate for longer and find creative solutions at work, it was quite a surprise because I thought that cigs breaks unleashed my creativity, now I see that every kind of break works, smoking was a distraction. 

Each time I take a deep breath I feel the freedom from the continuous cravings that made me looking forward for the next fix, even at the cost of interrupting pleasant activities. Please take some deep breaths during your day, they are so good now, as a smoker I felt that I was about to cough.

The thought that makes me happy lately is: "I feel that I will not smoke a cig even if I were alone, injuried and dying in 5 minutes". If I ever relapse it will be just a stupid error, I do not want just another cig which will be followed, for sure , by thousands. I smoked for 16 years, during the last 2 years a pack a day, I am not allowed to smoke at work so it was not unusual for me to smoke two cigs in a row.
    
I cannot trust any good feelings/memories associated with smoking, they are just deceitful illusions caused by addiction. I am mad at nicotine, this drug created a junkie inside my brain. 
Every time the junkie conceives a deceitful thought to make me feed him and I spot it, he gets more quiet and more hopeless.
Every time I have a craving and say no, I am breaking free from a conscious or subconscious conditioning. Every time I live the same situation without smoking it gets easier.

I hope that everyone of you guys can get to the right mindset and then, after a deep breath, say: "most of the times, it is easier to be an ex smoker than a smoker"

I messed up. After 2 years smoke free, I intermittently took drags off my brothers New Port's.

I was visiting my family, and I guess my nerves got to me. 

I don't hang around smokers in my everyday life; I actively avoid them like the plague. However, I didn't have much choice as this is my family. 

I feel like shit, like I just got environmentally lucky these past two years. I feel like its only a matter of time before I relapse again. 

What scares me most is my innate willingness to ask for a Ciggy. My self control just went out the window. 

I'm back in my typical environment now, and haven't felt any cravings... I think I am going to freak out if I feel one though.

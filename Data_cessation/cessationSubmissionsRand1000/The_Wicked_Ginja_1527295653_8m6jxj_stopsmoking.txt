Day 5

Day 5 is coming to an end. I've been less of a monster today so I've been told. But, I was so angry earlier, I punched a wall. It's been an incredibly stressful week outside of quitting smoking. 
All I want to do right now is relax on my back porch with a cigarette.  Honestly, I'm tired of feeling crazy.  I'd like my old self back for just a little bit.

Got through the overnight shift without smoking.

Threw my pack away last night after having my last smoke.

I can't believe I did it with little effort, got through this entire overnight shift with nobody to talk to, nothing to do, without smoking a single cigarette. One more overnight shift tomorrow, and then I am off for three days.

I'm going to do it this time, I did it once before for two years, I just need to keep doing this tomorrow, the next day, following, and for the rest of my life.

Worst thing about quitting...

is smelling all that fine food my neighbors are grilling atm. I'm chilling outside with a drink, totally not craving a smoke, but that delicious burger they got on the grill. And freshly cut grass. The memories of childhood, when my sense of smell was unfucked is so worth the effort. Fuck cigarettes. I'm angry I smoked so long. Fuck, I need that burger tho....😵😍 🍔😋

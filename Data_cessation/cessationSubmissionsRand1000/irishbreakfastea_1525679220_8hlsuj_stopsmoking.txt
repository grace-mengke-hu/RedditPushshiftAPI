3 days complete!

Just wanted to tell you guys that I am still here, I never stopped trying to quit.  After the first failed attempt, and the second, and the third, and so on.  And now I am proud to say I have finished day 3, onto day 4.  To all of those who slip and fail, I say get up, brush yourself off and try again.  No one succeeds when they stop trying.  

I feel like I have learned something from each and every slip.  Things to avoid, traps to be aware of, ways of handling cravings.  I got experience.  And now I am so proud that I have made it this far!  

I love being a nonsmoker.  And I can't thank this subreddit enough for all the support :)

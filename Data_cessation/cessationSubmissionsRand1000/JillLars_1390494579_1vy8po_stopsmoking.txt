Day 5

Going on day 5 and things are going well so far.  I've been using a 14 mg patch, and puffing on my e-cig occasionally (primarily during my long commute every day.)  I've had a few cravings here and there, but they've been manageable, and I know that giving in to 1 craving will put me right back where I started.  I know this about myself.  I can't smoke 1 or 2, it's a pack a day or nothing.  I have to remember this.

I've been going to the gym and riding on my trainer at home in the evenings to keep myself busy and get healthier in the meantime.  I've been tracking my food and have actually managed to drop a couple of pounds.  I keep my desk stocked with dum-dum suckers and low-cal kettle corn to keep my mouth busy while I'm at work.

A couple of my co-workers quit at the same time and they've had a few slips, but I'm trying to be supportive of them while maintaining my own quit.  An e-mail went out to our company yesterday about a co-worker with stage 4 lung cancer.  Young guy, my age, early 30's...not a smoker, but I don't know if he used to be or not.  Either way, he's not doing well.  He's got 2 little kids (just like me.)  I don't want to be there.  I don't want to die of lung cancer, and I know there's no guarantees in life-I could get hit by a beer truck today, but why tempt fate?

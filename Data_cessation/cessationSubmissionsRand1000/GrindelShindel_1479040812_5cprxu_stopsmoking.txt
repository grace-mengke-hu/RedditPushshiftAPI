Feeling Low...

I am on day 6 now. The first few days I was feeling great and had a shit ton of energy. Now I don't even have a crave for a cigarette or something, but I just can feel that denying those cravings just lowers my energy and willpower somehow.
I am now at work and I probably should do my work, but I am just lying on a sofa, watching the clock and wondering how slow time can pass by.
Did anyone of you have this moment too after quitting?

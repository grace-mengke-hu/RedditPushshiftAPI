Know I need to stop, but can't seem to make my self want to stop.

I have been smoking for a very long time +30 years. I have at times took a "break" (When I was pregnant for example) however, once the reason I couldn't smoke is no longer the case, I always go right back.  
My problem is I have convinced myself that I like to smoke. I like the person I am when I smoke (not as nervous, not as moody). I also don't like to fail and every time that I have tried to quit and not succeeded is, to me, a failure. I put an enormous amount of pressure on myself about this. I am usually a very strong willed person and do not like to admit when I have a weakness so I avoid the fact that smoking is my biggest one.  
I tried the Chantex and seemed to have every dang side effect possible. Doctor finally took me off of it due to this.  
I currently am stuck in the house due to some kind of crazy thing that goes in and out of remission and so cannot get outside, do a lot of physical activity and so on and this adds to my frustration. I am having to learn how to be me, without being able to be the me that I have been for years and so I tend to cling to the remnants of my past.  
Smoking is my security blanket, my rebellion, my escape, my companion, my constant.  Setting them aside opens me up to a lot more than simply not smoking.  
The times in the past that I have stopped (don't like to say successfully because it wasn't) was never because I wanted to do it for my benefit. It was always to benefit another and now, I just seem to keep finding one reason/excuse after another as to why I keep smoking.   
Sorry for the wall of text, just wanted to voice my situation and see how others may of dealt with this. BTW, even just typing this and submitting is scary to me.

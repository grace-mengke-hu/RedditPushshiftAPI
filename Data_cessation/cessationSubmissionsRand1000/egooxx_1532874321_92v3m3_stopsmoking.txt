snapshot (smoking is dumb)

this is not interesting and i just want to write it down for myself. 
i roll my own cigarettes and i always smoke at my kitchen's window. my boyfriend and me wanna play fortnite now, i just wanted to have a smoke before we start. so i sit at the window and while i start to make my cig, my papes fall out of the window down in our garden. my foot is injured atm, so normally i'd ask my boyfriend to get them for me. but he's already playing and i know he'd nag about me smoking anyway. so i decided to put some shoes on and to limp down the two floors, even though my foot is hurting. worst part of this? it's the second cig i smoke, i smoked one right before the papes fell down. 
i then thought: i could just jump right out of the window just to get my papes. of course i wouldn't do this, because i would break my legs or even worse. it's a dumb action that would result in injuring myself, that's why i'd never do it. but... where's the difference to smoking? i chose to walk down the stairs in order to not injure myself by jumping out of a window, just to smoke two cigarettes that harm my health in a similar way. 

every night i lie awake and think about death and how i'm putting my life at risk, even though i'm so looking forward to my future. 

i don't know whether i'll make it tonight, but i'll try to quit as long as it takes to be successful.

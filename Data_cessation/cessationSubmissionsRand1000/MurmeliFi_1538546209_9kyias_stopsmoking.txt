I relapse at nights

In my dreams I smoke. Or they aren't dreams, they are nightmares and they are always the same. I smoke and then regret it. It's always nice to wake up and realise it was just a nightmare but I wish I stopped seeing them. Does anyone else see these dreams/nightmares?  Why do I keep seeing them?

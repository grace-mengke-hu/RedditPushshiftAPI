I am quitting on Friday.

I won't lie. I am feeling some kind of fear. I am anxious and at the same time excited to start my quitting journey. I tried in the past but I failed. My longest absence from smoking was 2,5 years. Wish this time be forever. I have to change a lot of stuff of my daily life. This is a new journey for me. If you have any tips or some things that worked for you please share. I can't wait to have more energy, save money and feel cleaner.

First time drinking last night and I didn't smoke!

Last night I went out and got absolutely pissed out of my mind for the first time and I didn't smoke. It was probably one of the most mentally challenging things I've ever done but once I lifted myself out of the low point and started to enjoy myself I soon forgot about those cravings. When I quit before I used nrt and didn't drink for a couple of months so this for me is a big achievement, especially as this time I have done it cold turkey. I was a chain smoker and smoking literally consumed everything I did. If I can do it then anybody can!

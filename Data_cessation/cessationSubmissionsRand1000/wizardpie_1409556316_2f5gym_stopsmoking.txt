The Dreams

Hi everyone,

So been successfully quitting cigs so far. Been kind of eating and sleeping ALOT, especially this weekend. Just had a dream where i was having a dream and smoked in that dream, woke up from said "dream" and thought i had smoked! Well, I actually woke up just a little bit ago and im relieved that it was all just dreams. My mind is seriously trying to fuck with me right now, also am thinking of qutting cannibis for a short while, i have already cut down dramatically since i quit cigs cold turkey. It takes mayeb one or two hits and i am done, just not sure if i should completely stop cause i know my dreams will get even more intense, even nightmarish when i stop smoking weed. Im not sure what to do, im not really smoking that much weed anymore and it would probably be good for me to stop for 30 days or so. Anyone have this type of situation?

Turning 30 today. Setting quit date. Would love support.

Smoker 12 years (YIKES) and somewhere along the way I internalized that quitting before I turned 30 was non-negotiable. But today is my 30th birthday. So it's time.  
  
I'm a serial quitter and have been on this sub a while. I've literally quit dozens of times, for days or weeks at a time, and relapsed.  
    
I know that today I'll be out celebrating life with wonderful friends and if I started a quit today I'd fail, but I'm thinking it through and setting a quit date for this week, so I can celebrate life by not slowly killing myself.  
  
Over the past 2 years of learning about this addiction and my relationship to it (via those multiple failed quits), I'm pretty well-armed with practical info and self-knowledge, but am posting on this sub for a little support as I set that date and go for it. I finally accepted a while ago that, for me, healing from addictions is/was a long process, and I'm not one of those people who was able to just wake up one day and quit, much as I tried and wanted to. It's been a long road of figuring stuff out, which has been useful on a lot of levels beyond just dealing with nicotine. As to nicotine, though, I've finally learned it's not actually complicated, and it doesn't have much to do with me. It's just a really, really addictive drug. The only way to quit is just to stop for long enough that the addiction is starved out of the brain and body, which doesn't even take that long, and isn't even so rough to go through. And then to know (and I do) that one fuck up is enough to restart the whole cycle of crap again. I know this, and it's time to put it to use.  Anyone else want to quit with me this week? :D

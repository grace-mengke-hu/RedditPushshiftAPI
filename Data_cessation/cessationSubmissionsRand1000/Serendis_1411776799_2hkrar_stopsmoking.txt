Accountability and Motivation

I'm not giving myself the opportunity to fail this time around. This quit *feels* different.

I've done so many things this time to cement it.  I wanted to write them all out in hopes that they might help someone else.

1) I told my children I was quitting. This simple thing, was HUGE for me. I looked my son in the eyes and told him I was going to try to quit forever and that I would keep trying until I could. 

2)I got a badge here and started posting here.

3) Sounds silly, but I put a post it note on my computer monitor at work with the date and time of my quit and little tick marks counting the days....it's like a badge I look at while I work...I don't want to tear that off and start it over...

4) I've jumped into my triggers headfirst.  Had conversations with my husband on the porch while he has a smoke, there's half a pack in my car and always some in the house, I've even worn my husband's hoodie to take the trash out, freshly smoked in with smokes and lighter in the pocket.  

5)Started exercising, just walking at first, now I'm running again.  This helps, SO much with the anxiety and cravings.

6)This morning I sat at the dining room table with my kids and moved ten days ($80) of cigarette money into a special savings account.  We're going to do that together every ten days I don't smoke, and use the money to go to Disney next year.  Kids printed the brochure and stuck it on the fridge, lol.

So.

There's a lot riding on this quit for me.  That's how I know....I'm honestly not even questioning it anymore.  I know that of it gets hard, I'll fight it and persevere, and if I slip, I'll get right back up. 

This is it, people.  I'm a NON FUCKING SMOKER.

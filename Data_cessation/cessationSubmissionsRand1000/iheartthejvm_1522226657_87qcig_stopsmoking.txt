Not smoking through a break up

My relationship of 2 years ended yesterday.

Over the past three days I've had several moments where I've really wanted to smoke, I've had some extremely negative emotions and dealt with some really heavy stuff. I'm going to continue to feel like complete shit for the next few weeks and months probably.

I know I'm strong enough to not pick up the cigs again, I've been through a lot already and I know that things will only get easier, having kicked my nicotine addiction I'm sure I can kick my addiction to my now ex.

Anyone else experienced this and have some words of wisdom for me so I can read over this whenever I feel like I might need a smoke?

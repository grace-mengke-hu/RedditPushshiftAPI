Cautionary tale on the side effects of smoking...

When I quit I started exercising right away, and I thought when I started jogging my lungs would hold me back.  Embarrassingly, this was not true.  Smoking makes you lazy, and I'd been lazy for over two decades.  My leg muscles had atrophied to such a point that they spit the bit on a jog before my lungs did.  That was a surprise.  Only now, 48 days and 25 jogs later, can I jog until my lungs burn and my heart jackrabbits.  Smoking had done ancillary damage all over my body, not just to my lungs and heart.

Something that gets lost in pop culture is people think smoking has long term effects and increases your chance at cancer and other old people diseases.  What needs to be shouted from the rooftops is that smoking is making your life worse Right Fucking Now.  Forget about Old You, you're fucking Young You.  That's not being made clear enough.

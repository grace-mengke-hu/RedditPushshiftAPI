Hooray! I made it! One year!

Hello fellow-quitters,

I finally made it! One year tobacco free! I have proven to myself that I can quit bad habits and that I control my own body, not some toxic leaves!

/r/stopsmoking was a great tool in maintaining my focus and getting help from other quitters. Without you guys it would be much harder! 

After a while I became less and less active on this sub, and the last months I was only cheering for other quitters. I didn't had the feeling that I needed to post something, or rant, or whatever. 

I killed the addiction, but I have to stay focused. Tobacco is an evil bastard. 

Remember! You can quit too, everybody is able to quit with the right mindset. I wish you guys all the best in the journey of quitting! I will still cheer for people when they post something, but I don't know frequent it will be.

Thank /r/stopsmoking for saving another addict!

Back at square one, no more slip backs

Hello fellow non smokers, I have managed to quit smoking thanks to this sub after 17 years of being cursed with such a filthy habit! Well, after some health issues emerged few weeks ago, in a moment of pure weakness I light one up... fast forward today, I think I’m more addicted than I’ve ever been, so here goes my rant for all the people who consider quitting: I can not stretch this enough, but you would not imagine how much misery smoking can bring to your life. From physical weakness, lost of appetite,  fatigue, bad breath, but the most important factor is the quality of the time spent with your loved ones (after getting addicted, you will not feel pure joy/happiness unless you have nicotine in your bloodstream). For me it remains the biggest mistake I’ve ever done, and my advice for all of you is to find joy in the little things in life and not in a dead plant that will eventually kill you because you were too weak to let it go!

Emptiness

I don't know if I feel this way because I'm not smoking or because I feel like the effects of cigs don't matter anymore. Everything is boring and tasteless, I'm anguished. It is not nicotine withdrawal, I've been on patches and using my vape. There's just that emptiness, the kind you physically feel swelling from your chest. I haven't smoked yet but I'm struggling to find a reason not to.

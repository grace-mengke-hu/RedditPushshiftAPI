Starting on day two...

Was walking from the train station towards work and this little voice in my head was just a-going. "Buy a pack, 1 won't hurt, no one will know". I just turned up the volume on my headphones and kept walking. I was pretty fuc\*ing miserable as it's pretty cold in Toronto today. As I was walking, I saw a young lady outside smoking, alone and shivering. I thought to myself "well, I don't need that at any rate". It made the walk to work a little better.

I still have this low level tension around me, but at least I don't have to run outside every hour or so.

7 days without a smoke

Feeling pretty good!

* running/weight lifting improved
* fear of dying a horrifying death isn´t on my mind anymore
* sleep improved
* smelling things is awesome
 
Even nasty comments from friends are great... "oh, you want to try to quit again... how cute... yeah we know how that ends... don´t kid yourself".

Thats a nice exercise in which I can practice staying calm without a cigarette ;D

Thanks to all you guys, you helped me tremendously!

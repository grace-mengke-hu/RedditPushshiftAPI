Craving super hard : (

I'm not in any real danger of relapsing, just wanted to share how frustrated I am that for some reason my brain has picked tonight to say "go on.... just a couple.... just buy a pack and smoke tonight, you've earned it, then throw the rest away to waste your money as punishment...."

I mean you know something is B.S. when it is somehow both a reward and a punishment at the same time. but its still really frustrating to just arbitrarily feel like doing something stupid and unpleasant would make life wonderful : (

Curse you nicotine! And curse myself, not for getting hooked initially which can happen to anyone, but for tossing my previous quits to the wind with the arrogant notion that it would be fine. Well here I am and its. not. fine.

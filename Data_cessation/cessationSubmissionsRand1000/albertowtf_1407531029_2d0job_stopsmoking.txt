push ups!

I dont know how I didnt think of this before. Its been very long since the last time I did push-ups. Almost as much as I have been smoking

The last cravings I had, I just drop in the floor and made a few push-ups. Cravings were gone

If only I had thought about this a month ago, I would already had a month of push-ups in my back :)

100 days nicotine free!!

It hasn't been easy, but it's been way easier than I ever thought it would be. Thanks /r/stopsmoking for the support these last 3+ months. 

If anyone reading this happens to be a lurker; thinking about quitting, I used a 3 pronged attack: this sub, the "smoke free" app, and the Allen Carr book. I didn't do any nicotine replacement. I'm sure there are other ways, this is just what I did. 

100 days in, I honestly think some of the anti-smoking propaganda that is so ubiquitous misrepresents how hard it actually is to quit. Don't get me wrong, it's hard and takes serious effort. But, it's completely do-able. Remember, you weren't born a smoker. Your default setting is "non smoker". All you have to do is stop ingesting nicotine and your body will reset to the factory default settings.

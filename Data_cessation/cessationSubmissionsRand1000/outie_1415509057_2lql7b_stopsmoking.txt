I had my first smoking dream last night.

By far the strangest, and possibly the most lucid dream I've ever had. 

I was standing in the gas station, in line to check out with a bottle of water in my hand. It wasn't just any gas station, it was the circle-k station own the road from my house. The eccentric, outgoing black guy with the slicked back hair was working the register. And like so many days before, he asked me "anything else for ya man?" And I replied, "yeah a pack of Marlboro lights." I walked out, grabbed the lighter from my glovebox and smoked one like the last 9 days had never even happened. 

I don't remember what happened next, but the next thing I remember clearly was a vivid scene where I was in my wife's car, every detail was there from the heated seat to the empty Subway bag and half empty dunkin donuts coffee in the cup holder... 
She was driving, we were talking, I think we had just left a doctor's appointment. Maybe her OB?

 So anyway, without a thought, I cracked the window and lit a cigarette. I got halfway through it and she looked at me and I realized that I had smoked about half a pack today and I hadn't smoked in 8 or 9 days prior to that... WHAT AM I DOING??!

I woke up feeling extremely guilty and dirty, and it took me quite a while to realize that it was only a dream, and I hadn't actually smoked. 

But despite this dream, all day long I haven't thought about or wanted a cigarette, so day 9 will still be turning into day 10!

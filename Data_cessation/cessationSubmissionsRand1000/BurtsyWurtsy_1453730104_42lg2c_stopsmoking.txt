Today I achieved something I thought was going to take me a lot longer

I realise I've not climbed Everest, or completed a marathon, but this feels like a pretty big achievement to me.

I'm in pretty good shape, I play football (soccer) twice a week and do a few exercises every morning, sometimes I even go for a run at lunchtime.

I work near Regent's Park in London & I occasionally will go running there. Usually I run around half the park and when I get back my lungs feel like fire. I've always wanted to run round the whole thing but I've just never been fit enough.

Anyway today I went out for a run for the second time since quitting...and what's more I blitzed the fucking thing. I hadn't intended to run round the whole park, I definitely thought I'd have to train more before I did, but my body was telling me to keep going, instead of give up.

Thanks guys for giving me the motivation to quit, I never expected it to feel this great.

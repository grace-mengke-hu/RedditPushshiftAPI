Day 9: No smokes, No Drinks, Yes Workout

Almost double digits for eliminating double addictions! Body and mind finally cleared of the haze and started back into my weight lifting exercises  yesterday. Used to workout five days a week for about 1 1/2 hours a day until alcohol and cigarettes took over my mind and lungs. Time to rebuild! Yesterday was chest and back/abs - today biceps and shoulders/abs! Time to lose this beer gut and get back to the life I should be living! Today I will not smoke with you

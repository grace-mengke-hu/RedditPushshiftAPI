Calculated savings from quitting

I have tried quitting multiple times in the past, no go. I recently spent 3 years without a car and finally got one, which was one of my new year's resolutions. The other resolutions were to either get a new job or go back to college, and to quit smoking. I'm already in the process of interviewing for a new job and feel like I have a good shot at it, so that may happen. Now I just need to quit, and I quit 2 days ago (ended up sick yesterday and missed work).

Going a bit crazy right now, so I wrote out how much I'll save by the end of the year from not smoking. Here's the results at $7/pack:

 * By Sep 10th, I will have saved $49
 * By Sep 17th, I will have saved $98
 * By my birthday (27th), I will have saved $168
 * By October I will have saved $196
 * By November I will have saved $413

And by 2015 I will have saved **$840**. 

That's just by the end of the year. However, I know a bunch of that savings will be spent on food to combat the dopamine-release cravings, but this is a little tangent I just went into while at work today.

5 months update

It feels good knowing that I can outsmart my own asshole brain (I don't know how that makes sense but it does) and that at least for this particular period of my life, I am the one who knocks. 

2 days ago I bought Saints Row IV and a bottle of wiskey, I made some lasagna and invited a friend over (who is a smoker). Needless to say I got shitfaced. 

My asshole brain tried to trick me when my guard was down, tried to kick me in the balls, but not this time. I didn't smoke at all, even though I was drunk and my friend smoked next to me. Fuck you brain and fuck yeah, 5 months!

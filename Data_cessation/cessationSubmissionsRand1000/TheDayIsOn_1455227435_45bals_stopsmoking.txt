4 Months Today!

I am living proof that you can quit.  I was a pack plus a day, unapologetic smoker for 28 years.  I loved it and didn't care. However, I decided to quit back in the fall, bought the patch and had it on my dresser for about three weeks. I woke up October 11th and felt horrible. Not so much from some drinking the night before but from the smoking.  It finally clicked for me so I finished the last 3 cigarettes in my pack and put on the patch at noon.  It has not been easy but I have enjoyed getting my health back.  I feel great, don't stink like an ashtray, I've saved $1,300, run 2 to 3 times a week and really enjoy not being a smoker.  The smell of cigarettes is actually repulsive to me now.  I still get an occasional desire to smoke but I'll never fall back. To all you new quitters just know that the first week sucks and all you can do is be stronger than the addiction. You have to really want to quit and you will if you stay strong.  There is no downside to quitting. Good luck everyone!

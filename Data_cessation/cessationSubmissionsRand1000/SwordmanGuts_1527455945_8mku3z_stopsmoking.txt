Quit 14 day's ago and just passed the ultimate test, I'm really done with smoking.

2 weeks ago, I tried to quit again and I still have not smoked. Like many, when I drink alcohol I always want to smoke more. I drank 2-3 times and did not end up smoking, which made me felt very good, but it was still not my ultimate test.

Yesterday, I went to my parents house and they smoke inside. Since I usually am alone smoking and have to go outside, I would smoke about 20 cigarettes a day. But at my parent's place, I would smoke around a pack and a half. It was also here that I started smoking back when I quit for 1 month in the past.

Well, I am proud to say that this time, I did not smoke at all, not even one puff. I got this, and you guys too!

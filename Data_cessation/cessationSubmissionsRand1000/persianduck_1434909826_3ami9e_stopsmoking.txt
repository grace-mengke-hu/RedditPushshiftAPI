Day 1

Yesterday I finally summoned the courage to read Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking. Last night I smoked my final cigarette. I know the next few days/weeks will be tough, but I'm excited for the challenge. I want to be free of these chains that have shackled me for the last 4 years. With family, friends, internet strangers, and a positive outlook I know I can do it.

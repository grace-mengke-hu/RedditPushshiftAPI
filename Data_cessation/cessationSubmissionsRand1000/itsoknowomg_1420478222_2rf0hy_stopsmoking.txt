Idea when quitting

I had an idea And i did it today, i recorded myself with a smartphone as a reminder why did i quit smoking when its still fresh.
Its for my future self, maybe when Ill be in huge stress or something. 

I think it might be very powerful reminder as thoughts get weaker over time. Especially if you Just stopped or want to stop. 


What do u think?

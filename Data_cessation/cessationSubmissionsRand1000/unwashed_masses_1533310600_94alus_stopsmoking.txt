100 days? Really?

The first week was really tough. Then each week after that was slightly less tough. And then.... all the hard part just kind of quietly disappeared into the background like a bad relationship. 

Your quit WILL GET EASIER AS TIME PASSES. Allow yourself to feel shitty. That is you healing. Roll with each mood swing, the anger management, the depression, the  brain fog. That all goes away. Just don't smoke today. That's all you need to do.... just don't smoke today.

Reading Allen Carr's easyway to stop smoking really helped.
Everyone in this sub really helped. 
Rewarding myself helped.

With the money I saved, I bought a puppy. She is so much more fulfilling than cigarettes ever were.

Please. Don't smoke today, and do something beautiful with the money and health that you save.

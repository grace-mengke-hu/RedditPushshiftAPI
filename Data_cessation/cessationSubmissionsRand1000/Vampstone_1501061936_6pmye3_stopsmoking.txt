I smoked a pack in two weeks

And now I keep thinking "I already put my self on risk for cancer, no point stopping now" But how true is this?

If I stop smoking(I think I can, I only do it when I'm REALLY bored and maybe a bit lonely) 

Did I already fuck up my lungs for life, or do I still have a chance of keeping them healthy if I don't smoke ever again?

Excuses we give to return to smoking, it truly is a mind game

I always used to break under pressure, however, I'm starting to understand that nothing is worth damaging my health. 

I would say 'I'll just smoke until I start earning 'x' amount of money at work and then I will quit. Enough is enough, I've got a good e-cigarette now where the threading doesn't break, I think this is the last time I ever go back for sure

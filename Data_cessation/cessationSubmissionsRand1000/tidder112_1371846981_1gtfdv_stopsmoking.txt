I have finally reached my goal, now I know I am officially an ex-smoker.

Unlike a lot of people here, I am fairly lucky that I only started smoking at the end of a bad relationship; Which was ~2 years ago, and I have been quitting unsuccessfully for a year.

I have a very addictive personality so it was not a challenge for me to get hooked on smoking, which I was mature enough to know was bad for me, but at the time, did not care.  It was filling a void and it was a definite cry for help.

I am happy to have a family that does not smoke and it was with their help that allowed me to finally quit for the last time.  I hated the judgement they gave me, I hated that I had to try and hide it, but in the end, it was my family who really showed they cared and really wanted me to stop.  I was going to do what I wanted regardless of their opinion about it, but I understood why it bothered them, and I am not just talking about the smell.

This SubReddit, along with the badges, which acted as a incentive helped a lot.  I also found an android app called QuitSM that really helped me stay focus.  The numbers going up was what kept me stable, and every day instead of pulling out a pack of smoked, I pulled out my phone and stared at those progress bars.

I did it!  I am not out of the dark yet, but the smoke is clearing and I see a future where I can say I am a non-smoker, and I hope that future is a bright one.

I wont relapse, this is the farthest I have gone, and I earned that badge.  I am going to collect them all. Smoker-Non!

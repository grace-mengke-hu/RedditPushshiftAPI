Week 4. Need a /r/stopcookies sub

Week 0. Quit smoking. Joined /r/stopsmoking. Doing fine.

Week 2. Found myself drinking more instead of smoking. Quit drinking. Joined /r/stopdrinking. Doing fine.

Week 4. Eating way too many cookies. People leaving them out for Christmas. Carb addiction, I suppose. Need a /r/stopcookies sub.

Yes, addictions of diminishing concern. Mostly joking. Bit serious. Probably will wait till January for a diet.

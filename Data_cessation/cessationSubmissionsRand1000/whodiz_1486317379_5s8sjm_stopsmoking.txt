How long does the insomnia last?

I've had it since I quit and I can only sleep after 2am even tho I'm tired. I just toss and turn. Has anyone had insomnia that lasted this long? Any ways to combat and sleep earlier? I have been exercising too. 

Would appreciate some advice and tips! I don't get sleep at night and spend my lunch breaks taking naps :/ thank you!

I relapsed, what a waste of effort.

Today was supposed to be my eleventh full day without cigarettes, today was a festival, I knew it was gonna be tricky, but I was confident before I got drunk that I wouldn't have a single puff.

I got drunk, and I just didn't think properly, my defences were crushed like nothing, this was my first time getting properly drunk since I quit, but I underestimated how fucking hard it is not smoking when I'm drunk.

I don't know what I'm hoping to get out of posting here, now that I'm fully sober out of the festival at home it's just hit me what I've done.

I was starting to beleive this was it, this was THE QUIT.

For fuck sake.

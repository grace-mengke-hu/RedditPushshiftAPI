Self destructing and surprise cravings?

Hey! It's been a while :)
I didn't post at the 2 months mile stone because I was so over it, I forgot to. However, I've had some weird, unexpected cravings the last few days.

So after like 2 weeks, the smell and the look and everything was gross and post Allen carr reading I just pitied smokers. I don't know whether I'm just getting re-accustomed to it because I have so many smoker friends, but it smelt good again yesterday. I don't want to be back to it smelling good!
AND I have this weird thing where when something bad happens, especially if I feel "neglected" or ignored by someone, I have always jumped straight to self destructive tendencies and it makes me feel better. For instance "fuck them, I'm going to smoke" as if that's going to punish them or something. I know it won't, and my smoking was never about them or in anyway connected to them, and they probably wouldn't even know, but my brain has gone back there a few times recently. I thought I was past that :/
How do I break this idea that self destructing is a way to cope with sadness or stress? Big question, I know! Doing nice things for myself really doesn't feel anywhere near as satisfying. It's like I need a way to express my anger or something.
And the other one is that the other day, I missed the sensation. I ignored it and went to the gym and that seemed to help. Weirdly, not being able to breathe properly or strained breathing seems to be what I was craving! Haha.
(I sound like a crazy person. I promise I'm kind of normal, sometimes)

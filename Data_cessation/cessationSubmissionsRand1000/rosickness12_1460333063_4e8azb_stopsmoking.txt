41 days was a record. Just reset it and didn't crave the cigarette.

Last night I had a few smokes. Had no desire for a smoke but did have the desire to hang out with smokers and BS.  This bar is a place in my hometown with a history for me. Hanging out with strangers and smoking on the patio is something I've done there a lot in the past. Time to stop going there for a while.

Working on day 5, gonna keep up with the daily posts I think

Something is working here and I don't want to mess whatever it is up. So sticking to the same formula. Wake up, get ready, make reddit post, go to school, come home, clean house, cook dinner, game, sleep. I'm just going to do that every day until this all gets easier to deal with. 

This morning I feel somewhat better but given how yesterday went that *could* be a lie. We will see how the day goes I suppose. 

I think what happened yesterday was that I just got really fed up with the situation. I don't like feeling this way or telling myself over and over again that it's worth it. I'm annoyed at this stage and I just want it done by now. Those feelings were harder to deal with than withdrawal or cravings.

Withdrawal has reduced again today though, so maybe the rest will get easier too. 

Sorry this one is kind of a downer I'm just tired :/

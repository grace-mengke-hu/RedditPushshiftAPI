Day 3: Sitting at work, nothing to do...

...and it is getting really hard to not go outside for a smoke.
Time is flowing slowly when there is nothing meaningful to do. Private Internet use is not allowed. Currently writing on my phone.
I'm bored and my mind tries to convince me to go for just one small cigarette. But I will be strong. I don't want to fall back to day zero.

Edit: I finished the day without a cigarette. Thanks for all your support!

Edit2: I still vape. But that is at least less harmful than normal cigarettes :-)

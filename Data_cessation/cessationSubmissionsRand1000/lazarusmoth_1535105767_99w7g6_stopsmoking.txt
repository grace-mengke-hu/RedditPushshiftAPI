Day 1, evening. Ready to quit quitting.

I'm writing this to try to see if this horrible feeling passes. I just ate dinner, and afterwards I'm hit with a really strong nicotine craving. My legs and feet (which have been feeling tingly all day) start hurting like they've fallen asleep. I'm dizzy from the intense waves of craving as I write this.

There is a disturbing rationalization that is at the back of my mind, about why I should just go to the store and pick up a cigarette and fuck this quitting thing:

I don't care if I die or not. I don't really care if I see more of my family or not. Smoking is my cowardly way of ending my life, one stick at a time. 

I'll wait another hour. I'm not sure if I'm pushing through with the quit after that with this fucking rationalization in my head. Any advice or words of support or insults most welcome.

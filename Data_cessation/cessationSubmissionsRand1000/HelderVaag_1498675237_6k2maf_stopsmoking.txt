It is day 3 and things are looking up

Aaaaaah the sweet feeling of being nicotine free. Yes, I felt like killing a coworker yesterday and yes, tears did flow and yes, I felt like a smoke would save me but guess what?? I did not smoke and today everything just looks a little bit better. I just wanted to share that with you, especially those going through a rough time. It will pass. It truly will. Just wait and see what happens and I can guarantee you: You will start feeling better soon! You got this.

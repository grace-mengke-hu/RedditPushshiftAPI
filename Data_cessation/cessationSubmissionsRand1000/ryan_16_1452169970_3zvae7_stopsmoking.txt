4 days / weird ass dreams

From my app: 4 days smoke free, 35 down, $12 and 03:29 saved!

Been fighting some of the strongest urges, even in my dreams. The other night I dreamt I was smoking a huge ass cigarette, 3 feet long and 6 inches wide. I felt guilty and then I woke up lol... Last night in my dream I vividly remember I went through all the work of mending a broken cigarette back together, only to look at myself in the mirror and resist the urge to light it up. Weird shit, but those icky sticks fucked my mind up. But on top of all the mucus and mouth sores, I am happy and proud of myself.

edit: Oh, and I used the money I saved to buy an Old School Runescape membership. Takes me back to those days before I ever smoked. Also it's still a rockin game.

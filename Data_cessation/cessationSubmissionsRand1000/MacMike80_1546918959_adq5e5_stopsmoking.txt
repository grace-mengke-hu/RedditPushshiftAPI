Day 7 was as tough as expected

I was worried about today since last night.  I had a personnel issue w one of my employees that I had to deal w today.  First I had to make a two hour drive there (driving is a trigger).  My employee is smarter than everyone else and knows everything and has been having the same problems w her work since day 1.  13 months after her first day it was time for a reckoning after much patience working w her to improve.  I didn’t come down on her that hard- here’s the kicker- her boyfriend (who works in another dept) called the president and said to the effect of “he’s picking on her; she’s one of the best reps he has; something needs to be done about him; my girlfriend is at home crying right now; I don’t know what to do”.  Once I got back to the office I took an ass chewing because i “should have approached this more gently”.  I took the speech from superiors, than dropped every single picture of her work in their inbox since this last August and asked if this was acceptable work, and when the right time to get more firm is; I havnt heard back yet.  Regardless- leaving the reps zone, and leaving the office later in the day I was pissed and wanted to smoke so freaking bad.  But instead i came home and punched some pillows for a while (I’m really usually not an angry person, but was tonight) and took a melatonin.  I AM a non-smoker.... I had to say this about 50 times while my throw pillows took an ass kicking.  Going to bed now- day 7 down.

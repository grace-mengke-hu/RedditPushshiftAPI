2.5 days in and smoked

It’s just so hard. I’m a single father of 3. I have my kids 90% of the time. I get very moody then feel bad for being a grump around my kids. Smoking was my way to deal with the stresses of having no friends and absolutely zero help with my kids. I work from home, I have no friends, and I have a stressful life being a single father. I know these are all excuses but it’s really hard to break any of these habits and triggers.

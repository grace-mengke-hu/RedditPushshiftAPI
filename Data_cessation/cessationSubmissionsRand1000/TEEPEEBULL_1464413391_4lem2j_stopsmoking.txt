700 Days Nicotine Fee ! WTF? My THOUGHTS

Here's the deal - I wrapped it up 700 days ago. Smoked from age 17-50 (33 years) Quit for 2 years...almost...missed it by about 3 weeks..
Then Quit again on June 28 of 2014, so 700 days. on May 29.
I'm getting real close to 2 years again and I am thinking about the whole circumstances that led to me falling off the wagon and smoking again. There was some unexpected crap going on at around 300 days, but I want this bad... and beating the two year milestone is very big to me! So I'm celebrating 700 days but watching that 2 year thing as a very determined 2 year MF'er! Who was RIGHT THERE...and f'd up.
AMA.....please.

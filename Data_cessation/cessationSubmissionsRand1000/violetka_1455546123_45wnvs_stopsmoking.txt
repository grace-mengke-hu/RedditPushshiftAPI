Embarking on day 3 !

I slipped 2 and something days a go, and had to restart my counting of smoke free days. It was the beginning of my 10th day when I slipped. however the thing is that while unpleasant, this slip was not fatal. I find it quite easy now to be smoke free, compared to the beginning, to my real day 2. The most important thing is to immediately go back to non smoking mentality and non smoking efforts, so that at least the physical aspects of the quit/withdrawal will not be present once again. So while it was a moral loss, I did not have to again have a real day 1 and a real day 2 and a real day 3 with all the nervousness and anxiety assosciated with them.
Anyway Welcome to my new day 3! And may the force help me not to smoke today! I feel proud and empowered by this quit. I have decided to make further lifestyle changes...do a lot of sports and start yoga breathing exercises. I always wanted to do yoga, asanas and pranayama, and now is my chance. so many more exciting things that are way better than the stupid cigarettes, I cannot believe I smoked for so long.

As Allan Carr says : smoking gives you nothing, but takes away so much.

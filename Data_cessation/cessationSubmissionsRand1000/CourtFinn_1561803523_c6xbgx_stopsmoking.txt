Today is going to be really hard!!

Going to an event that’s outside relaxing in a chair and listening to about 5 bands and people don’t have to get up and smoke. You can literally sit in your chair have a beer and smoke, and i’m going with all smokers except 2! It’s a 10 hour outdoor concert. I’m thinking about what to bring to help. Any suggestions?

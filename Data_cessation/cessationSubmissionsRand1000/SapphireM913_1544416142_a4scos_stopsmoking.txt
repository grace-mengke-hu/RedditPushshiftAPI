Long time no post, but it's been a bad day.

Quit date 8/1, patches and lozenges. It's kind of a weekly up and down now, rather than a daily one or an hourly one. It's been very very down. My boyfriend forgot about a play he was supposed to attend with me today, so I embarrassingly flew solo. The play was amazing and filled my heart. I got home and checked with my sister to confirm our plans for this Friday, my reward for making 1 month, tickets to Harry Potter symphony... Her step daughter is flying into town that day. She has to bail. This was so important to me.

I'm losing my job at the end of the month. I'm having surgery in a week and will be on opioids for a week, and that's what led to my last failure, I crave cigarettes like nothing else when I'm on pain pills.

I need some strength. I need some help. I need to feel like there's a reason to stay quit because right now, everything hurts. My heart hurts.

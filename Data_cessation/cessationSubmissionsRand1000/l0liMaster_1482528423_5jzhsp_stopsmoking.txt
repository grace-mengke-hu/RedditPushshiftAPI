I wanna quit smoking but all of my friends smoke

I started smoking around 2014 and have been on and off in terms of quitting. I mainly started because of the stress-relieving effects that the nicotine had in my body. I was 17 at the time.

In between then and now I've tried quitting via vaping and just cold turkey but vaping always has me still craving a cigarette because I still have the nicotine in my body, and probably would not bother vaping if I couldn't have the nicotine. I just really love the way it calms my anxiousness and the little headrush I get.

But now I'm 19 and I dunno if I just have weaker lungs than average but I already have a lot of trouble breathing sometimes and usually after or during a dart my lung/chest area gets really tight and uncomfortable.

I want to quit mainly because of high blood pressure risks as well as just the fact that I don't want to be in physical pain while trying to relieve stress.

My main issue though is that 99% of all of my friends smoke, and I can speak from experience that it's really difficult to resist the urge when all of your boys go out for a smoke and you either have to sit alone or go outside and just stand around while everyone else smokes. I always either end up smoking, whether sober or more often after a few drinks.

How can I quit? I don't want to have to ghost all of my friends for months while I get past my addiction.

Stat wise I smoke a pack in between anywhere from 2-4 days. Usually 2 pack/week. During stressful times or heavy partying it goes up to half pack/day but it's never the norm for me to smoke that much.

Any advice or feedback would be appreciated, thank you

Today is my birthday, and I won't let me be a potential deathday.

I'm 22 as of 41 minutes ago and I've been smoking since I was almost 12. That's ten fucking years, and a year short of half my life. 

I've tried quitting countless times in the past. I've stalked and commented in this sub reddit for quite some time, and it's time I make a change. I'm quitting today. 

For those of you who are just starting the quitting process and will most likely feel stress and aggravation feel free to private message me. Quit buddies are most welcome!

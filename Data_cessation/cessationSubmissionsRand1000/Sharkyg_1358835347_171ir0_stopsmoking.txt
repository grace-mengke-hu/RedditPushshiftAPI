Day 1 after quitting.

Yesterday was my 1st day of quitting. I kept account of craving. It was 9:30am before going to work(Co-workers were happy that I did not smell like shit) I am happy I controlled my craving. Again was at 11:30am. Then after lunch.At tea break. Again at 6:00pm and last after work hours around 8pm. But I managed to not smoke. And it is 11:45am here Iam at work managed to avoid morning smoke(Changed my way to work so that I can avoid cigrette shops). Iam posting it to avoid the craving Iam having now(feeling desperate chewing my pen poor pen will die today).

EDIT: It is 2:30pm now. 1 and half day with out smoking.

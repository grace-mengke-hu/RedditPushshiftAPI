One week.

So I hit the one week mark. It wasn't easy, but it wasn't hard either. For all of you doing it... good luck, I will gladly help motivate you and we can be quit buddies! Stay strong! It was so much easier after day 3. 
Also, I want to tell you... what I did, besides the money jar (where I would put the amount of money a cigarette is worth). I drank tea. I drank an unfathomable amount of tea this week. I blew through so much tea. I find it tasting better since stopping smoking. And Thank you all so much for your support and encouragement! You are wonderful!
So how are you guys? How is quitting going for you?

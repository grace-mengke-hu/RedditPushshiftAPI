Cool. 2nd star!

I wasn't sure the calculation this subreddit uses to decide when to change the star from a 1 to a 2, but its quite evident that a month is counted as every 30 days. 60 days quit today and feeling great. Muchos more energy than I have had in years. Skates 12 kilometer on the Rideau Canal last night in 1 hour 8 minutes. 

I am finding myself more "quick to anger" since I've quit smoking. Not often, but more so than when I used to be a smoker. I also find my emotions range more deeply too. The only thing I can think of is due to  the chemicals in Cigarettes or the nicotine itself that alters moods to be less severe. Hopefully this will settle down...

Happy to be here today and joining you all in not smoking cigarettes today. Enjoy the day all...

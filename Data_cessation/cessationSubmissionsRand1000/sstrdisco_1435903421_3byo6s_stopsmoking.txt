Please don't shut down /r/stopsmoking in light of Victoriagate

I don't know what happened with Victoria or Reddit or the mods - I don't know anything about any of it. I am aware of subs being set to private in solidarity, but please don't do that here. I, and so many others, need this sub. I hope everything works itself out, but in the meantime, please don't make this a closed sub. Thank you.

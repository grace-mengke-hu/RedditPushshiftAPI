Day 9, feeling very lazy

Physically I am almost ok, I even have a little more energy. Psychologically, I feel a bit empty, it is like I am dealing with a loss of something dear. I am postponing and reducing my chores, but this lack of enthusiasm  bugs me. Has anybody experienced this? Would you be so kind as to help me with some suggestions?
P.S.: I love this subreddit, thank you guys

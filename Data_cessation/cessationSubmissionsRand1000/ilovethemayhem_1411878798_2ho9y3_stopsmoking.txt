Drinking?

I want to go out and drink with my friends but I feel as though there's no point if my cravings will be strong and I won't be able to smoke. Like there's no point to drinking without smoking. I know this isn't true and I don't feel it in other aspects of my life, but I don't want to stop enjoying alcohol because of this. I know I'm not depriving myself but it FEELS like I'm depriving myself. What do?

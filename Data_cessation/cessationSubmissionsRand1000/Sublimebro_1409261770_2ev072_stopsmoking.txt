Something I noticed about a bad mood while being a nonsmoker.

Sorry I haven't posted here in a while! I promise I didn't forget about you guys, I've just been busy with exercise, work, and what not :) 

I was in an awful mood all day and this is what I noticed. 

Awful mood while I was a smoker: "I probably just need a cigarette, smoking is causing my bad mood. I'll just buy a pack and smoke until I feel normal again"

Today I couldn't use that excuse. Today I actually had to find the problem of my bad mood and I was able to work on fixing it. There was nothing clouding my judgment and I was able to focus on what was causing my irritability. 

This isn't something extremely amazing but I hope you quitters can relate and the ones thinking about quitting or are in the early stage of quitting have something to look forward to. 

As always. Thank you, /r/stopsmoking for all of the support. I quit cold turkey January 28th and I feel great!

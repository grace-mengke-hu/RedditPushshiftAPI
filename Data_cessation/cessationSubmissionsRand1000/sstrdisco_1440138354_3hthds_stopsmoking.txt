Hey, 4 months!

I was house sitting this weekend, far from home and the like. I stopped at a gas station to fill up and thought, "Oh, I could buy a pack of smokes." And it was just that. I "could" have done that. But I did not and it was nice to know in return that I am starting to really think of myself as a nonsmoker.

So grateful to be at the 4 month mark. If you're new to quitting, please keep going. It gets easier.

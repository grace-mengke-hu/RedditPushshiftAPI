Ta-Dah! One month r/stopsmoking!!

Thank you for the help & encouragement.  R/stopsmoking has been a daily stop when I've felt vulnerable.  And what an oddly insignificant thing a badge may initially seem but it actually has become a source of pride & the simple thought of resetting my badge has helped overcome challenging circumstances.  E-hugs to those in the baby steps stage of this endeavour.  It gets easier & the feeling of success is cumulative.  I am free!  I wish the same for you as well!

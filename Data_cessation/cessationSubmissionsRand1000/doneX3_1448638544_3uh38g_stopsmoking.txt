Day 5 checkin. The weekend temptation to indulge.

It's Friday, end of a heck of a week. 8 weeks into a new job, I finally managed to quit smoking. I actually changed jobs to get my health back. And here I am. It's the weekend. Time for a reward. Time for indulgence, a little badness. Time for a ... smoke?  Nope. I'm past physical withdrawal but feeling the first real psychological pull. I won't smoke. I'll find another way to indulge. Eat some pizza, drink one too many beers. Any novel suggestions?

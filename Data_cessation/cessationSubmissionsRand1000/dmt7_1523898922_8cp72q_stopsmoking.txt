Big Deal For Me! One week in as a Non-Smoker

The first week was not really as brutal as I thought. Granted I'm on Champix but was on it last time and started smoking after a month, stupidly thinking "oh yes I can have just one"...let me tell you...you can't! I feel like when I quit the last time, I was mourning a loss. This time I shifted my mindset. I told myself how much I hated smoking, how it was aging me, how expensive it is and how much I stunk. Basically every time I had a smoke I would berate myself or repeat the negatives- Whatever works I guess...hope this helps someone that is struggling as I think this mindset has truly has helped me.

Any hookah quitters out there?

I've been trying to quit a few times but I keep myself coming back to it. The hookah lounge in my area is where a lot of my friends like to hang out, and while I know I don't need to order a hookah to be there, I find myself unable to stay away, or abstain or go off a vape. Any tips or advice? I appreciate it.

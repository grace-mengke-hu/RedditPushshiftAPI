Just had my first real craving...

And so I went for a walk. The walk felt good and took my mind off the obsession. For the rest of the night I'm surrounded by non-smoking friends and family. I'm not worried about relapsing, I don't feel like relapsing, but the support and fun that we'll have will help take my mind off this feeling.

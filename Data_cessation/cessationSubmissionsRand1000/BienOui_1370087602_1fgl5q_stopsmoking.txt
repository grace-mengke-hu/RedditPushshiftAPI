I used to be a smoker and now I'm a runner! To all the folks with a new badge: You CAN do it!

I smoked for over 20 years.  r/stopsmoking is incredible, the people here are so supportive.  In my early days of quitting, this sub reddit is what kept me going and got me through.
I still have cravings from time to time, and I had a slip up along the way. I've gained about 12 pounds but I've started running with the help of r/c25k.  I love that I CAN run, now that I can breathe! 
I wanted to stop by and give back some of the support and encouragement that was given to me. Oh, and I wanted to check out my flair...55 days, Woot Woot!

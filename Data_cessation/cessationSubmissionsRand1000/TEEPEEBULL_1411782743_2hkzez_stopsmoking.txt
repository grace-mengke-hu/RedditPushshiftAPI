I've Been Waiting 90 Days to Say This...

Fuk You nicotine- and still Fuk You.
Milestones are nice and give reinforcement for the reason I began this journey after all these years of being a slave . Too many !!!!
Started my daily habit at 19. Kicked nicotine to the curb at 52.
(Kept fighting the thought that there's no difference if I quit now, damage is done and all that...but NO, that's addiction talking again)
Way too long I allowed this drug to control aspects of my life and deteriorate my health. No more man, I keep it real day by day.
Thank Redditors for keeping this sub going , I read more than I post but I appreciate everybody's stuff here.

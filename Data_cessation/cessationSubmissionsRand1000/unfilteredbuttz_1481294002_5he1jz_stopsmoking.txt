Beware: Postings or comments reporting simultaneous Cold Turkey with nicotine and other things

I've been seeing a few posts and comments here and there that are alarming.  Either a poster or commenter have decided to quit nicotine along with another vice suddenly with the cold turkey method.   They usually get an "atta boy!" or "you got this!" even though they mention they are experiencing unusual syptoms which are explained away with "everyones different" .

There was a commenter who explained that he quit nicotine and alcohol and was experiencing disorientation and hallucinations.
I am not a doctor nor do I need to be to see this as Delerium Tremens and at risk for grand mal seizures and Death.  He didnt need another upvote, he needed to be rushed to an emergency room.

If you see anyone report far out symptoms do a little prodding and encourage medical help.

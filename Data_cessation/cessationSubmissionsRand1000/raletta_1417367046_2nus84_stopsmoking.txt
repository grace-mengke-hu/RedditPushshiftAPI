Starting tomorrow-Need motivation

A few days ago I decided to quit on first of December. I started smoking a few years ago and now I am almost 25 and I want to quit now before it is too late. 
My biggest concern and the reason that I didn't try to quit earlier is that my motivation isn't big enough. I made the decision because I KNOW it is better for me (my health,financially,...) but I don't have the feeling that I WANT to quit. Most of my friends are nonsmoker which makes it easier and my first step was to tell them about my plans, so I have a little pressure from the outside. 
I think smoking is just one symptom from underlying problems that I have. I lack self-discipline and self-worth. I don't take my own health serious enough. I drink too much, eat too unhealthy and exercise not frequently enough. I hope I can work on all these problems, starting with quitting smoking. 
What was your motivation for quitting besides the hard facts?
I think I have to write a list to keep me motivated. :)

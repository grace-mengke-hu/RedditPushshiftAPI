How do you deal with the crushing depression and suicidal thoughts?

Because that shit is making it hard to work right now lol. 


It's also making it hard to get along with my husband, who is also quitting. We both get sensitive, and start arguing because one person will make a joke the other person sees as an insult (when normally we never would). But it doesn't feel like nicotine withdrawal until we look back at it later. In the moment, it feels very real.

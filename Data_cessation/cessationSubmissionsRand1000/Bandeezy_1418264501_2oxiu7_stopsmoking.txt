This time is the last time

So first and foremost, I want to say thanks.  This sub has played the roll of inspiration...to guilt trip.....and now I guess I'd describe it as a friendly reminder.  

I've been saying I should quit for about a year.  Started some half hearted attempts over the past few months that ended with minor issues which I deemed big enough to deserve a smoke.  I've gone weeks before, but it was always painful and for someone else.  I know I'm only 3 days in, but I'm actually quitting because I want to.  And honestly, it's felt far too easy so far.  I went out to the bar last night with some friends who smoke, and stayed smoke free.  Today I flew to NYC for work and met some co-workers out for dinner and drinks.  Just got back to my hotel, still smoke free.  Like I said, it's still very early in my quitting process, but I'm extremely confident I can do this.  I'm running, going to the gym, eating healthy, and I just feel good in general.

I'm 27 years old, smoked at least a pack a day for the past 8 years, and have been smoking regularly since I was 15.  I hate my cough, I hate how I was always leaving the party only to come back 5 minutes later smelling like an ashtray, I hate how I refuse to play sports anymore because I can't keep up.

This is it.  I'm really done.  And I just want to say thanks for making first consider quitting, making me feel horrible for when I'd start smoking again, and for reinforcing me now.

We all have the flu but mine is the worst...

My daughter caught the flu at Chuck E Cheese (aka the deepest level of hell) and passed it to her dad and now me. The flu shot/mist is a joke this year so we have all struggled with body aches, headaches, fever and a cough. I've been sick for twice as long as the rest of my family and it's all in my lungs. It's like I can feel the weight of tarry mucous in them... And when I cough, it's coming out in every color imaginable. 
I'm at just over a month of no smoking and haven't had any kind of gross stuff coughed out before this. Is this just a gross flu thing or a "I need to get my lungs checked out" kind of thing??

Day #50 done, onwards!

The thing is, smoking is not a habit of mine anymore however not-smoking is! Yes every now and then cravings come usually mildly, they are easy to handle. I really can focus on what I'm doing. I can work, play music, play games for hours without any breaks! Let's proceed to our adventure and thank you all.

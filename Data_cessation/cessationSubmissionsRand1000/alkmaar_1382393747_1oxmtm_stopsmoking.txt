So I took a few drags...

Of hookah. First time in 5 months. That too cause some really old friends of mine were over and wanted to go.

I rejected all offers to smoke cigarettes but took a few drags of a strawberry flavored hookah. It felt good! But not good enough to send me spiraling back to the intellectual pacifier.

Cheers boys. This counter ain't going back anytime soon!

Also I have a flu. Maybe its got something to do with the weather change but I was told to expect this during the first two weeks. Anyone care to shed some light on it?

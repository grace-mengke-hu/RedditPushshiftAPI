Would I be stupid to start using e-cigs now?

I'm 2.5 months in (doing cold turkey) and have been doing ok but the last few days I've had what feels like a lot of stress going on and for the first time yesterday I walked past the newsagents and was tempted. I've somehow convinced myself that if it gets bad using zero nicotine e-cigs would be ok. Do you think I'm setting myself up for a bigger fight long term or is it safe to use it? I've ordered some online so have a couple of days before they arrive to decide. What do you think?

Why can't I breathe?

It's Day 5, and I can honestly say I breathed better when I smoked. It feels like there's a cork in my windpipe. Like the air isn't making it all the way to my lungs. If this keeps up much beyond 2 weeks, I'll go to the doctor (I'm scared of the doctor, especially as it relates to my smoking...I just want my body to sort everything out ya know?)

Has anyone else experienced WORSE breathing after cessation?

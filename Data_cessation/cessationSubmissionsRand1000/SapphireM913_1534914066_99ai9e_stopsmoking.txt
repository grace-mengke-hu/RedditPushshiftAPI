Week 3. And we hates it!

Three hours ago I officially hit 3 weeks. My apps say it's tomorrow, but dammit, I need the win today. I worked 12 fucking hours doing a job that I'm not even supposed to be doing because I was volun-told to help this team, I signed off my computer for the night, and a MASSIVE craving hits. Fucking huge. Worst one to date. I know 3 weeks is a rough point. I am prepared for this. But the only thing that kept me in the house is the massive amounts of construction around me, and that it'd take 20 minutes of driving to get to the open gas station a mile away. This sucks. This just sucks. Especially because now I'm angry and won't be able to fall asleep and I'm already sleep deprived. Eat a bag of dicks, smoking. I SAID EAT IT.

Oh, and thanks, mother nature, for my monthly gift. I needed that today too. Asshole.

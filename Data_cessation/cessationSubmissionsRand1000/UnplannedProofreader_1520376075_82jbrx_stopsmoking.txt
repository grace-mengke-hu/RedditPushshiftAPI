If you haven’t been gifted a free audiobook on audible, I have Allen Carr’s ‘Easy Way to Quit Smoking’ to give.

Just pm me your email address and I’ll send you the link.  If you don’t use audible, you’ll have to get the app.   It was helpful to me to be able to lay still and just listen to his words without any effort on my part.  The quitter’s tension is killing me lol...I’m all for being as still as possible for as long as possible.

I know everyone is entitled to one gift book through the service but I’m not sure how many times it will let me give one.

Edit:  I got the title wrong...it should be “The Easy Way to Stop Smoking”.

A week away from beating my personal best

This time I decided to just do it and not keep track of my progress.  It's been easier for me to not focus on the time and just get through the days.  
This morning I happened to look at the calendar and was very happy to see that I have made it 31 days. Not one slip.  Not one puff.  31 honest to God nicotine free days.  
This is my 4th attempt since I initially quit in August.  I am so proud.  I think my brain finally came round to the  idea that I don't smoke.  I really don't.  I don't need it and I sure as hell don't want it.  
31 frickin  DAYS!!

What is causing the kick that comes from smoking, when plain nicotine doesnt deliver?

I know that smoking's psychological addiction might be much stronger than the physical. I've read a lot about nicotine, too. But i keep wondering, all the replacement therapies (gum, vaping, patches) deliver artificial nicotine, right? But AFAIK none really give the "kick", that overwhelming, intensely satisfying brainflood that comes with the first inhales of a real cig.

Now, i'm happy it is this way because at the moment the gum keeps my cravings well under control but i still clearly feel i'm taking steps away from my addictions, and definitely not just clearing my trigger situations. It can't all be mental?

So what is it physically that makes a cig so different from NRTs? Any or all the other chemicals inside? The lack of oxygen-to-brain after the first inhale?

Any pointers to read up on this might help me understand more about my addiction, and that can't be bad :)

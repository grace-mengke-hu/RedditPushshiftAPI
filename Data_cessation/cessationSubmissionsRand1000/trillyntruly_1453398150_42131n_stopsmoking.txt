A little over a year, do not give up guys!

Last December/January I was in a slump in my life. I felt like a failure due to my many failed attempts at quitting smoking, and things just weren't going too well for me. I finally had my last cigarette January 19th I believe and here I am today. My life isn't perfect but comparatively, I'm in an amazing place and still moving forward. I haven't had a cigarette in a year and I recently cut out weed from my life too. I've had a great and eventful year and I know the trend is going to continue.

For those early on in their quit, or still toying with the idea, or still struggling with it, I only ask that you do not give up and take it one day at a time. Eventually it'll be so easy to not smoke it will surprise you.

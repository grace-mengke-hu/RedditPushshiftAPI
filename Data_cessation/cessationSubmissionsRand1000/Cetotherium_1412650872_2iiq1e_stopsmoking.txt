Patch placement for active work?

I've decided I want to give the patch another shot before I try a non-nicotine medication, but I found at work they tend to peel of quite quickly as I am constantly moving around and lifting various objects (I'm a carpentry framer). Anyone have any tips on how I can get the patches to actually stay on through a work day?

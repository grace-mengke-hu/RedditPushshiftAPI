72 hours in.

I honestly thought today was going to be the easy day. I thought that the worst was behind me, I was wrong. I was still as amped up as the last two days, trying to straight face my bursting anxiety. I now have coffee stirring straws that I chew and twirl, they help. My mind still has a hard time focusing on for extended periods of time and I get frustrated knowing that my mind isn't right. Each day brings me closer to not feeling this way any more. I just want all of this to be over with. I don't want to smoke I just don't want any of this any more. I just keep telling myself:
This isn't forever.  
This is worth it.

What was the thing that kept you smoking?

For me it wasn't so much the nicotine itself, but the fear of going through hell when quitting and then spending the rest of my life craving for cigarettes. Quitters had told all the horror stories about not ever really letting go and it freaked me out. 

I'm at 4,5 months and I wish I knew it could be this easy. I used a small dose of Champix for a while and NRT too (though Champix sort of blocks nicotine) and while I had my share of the emotional rollercoaster, it was easier than I thought. Champix and NRT helped me quit and Allen Carr's book helps me stay smoke-free. If I had withdrawals, they sure were not what I imagined: mood swings and itchy skin. When a month was passed, I felt that the "quitting part" was over. Maybe even sooner than that. I had  a total of 12 cravings and they were all in September. My quit date was Sep 1st. 

So don't let your fears stop you. It might be easier than you think. And if struggling, I highly recommend Champix and Allen Carr. The way that book changed my thoughts on smoking and quitting was and still is very powerful. My husband quit too and isn't struggling at all. 

Please don't scare people who want to quit. :)

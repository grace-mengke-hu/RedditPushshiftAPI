Day 1 : again

I'm quite low on motivation, I basically quit because I run out of cigarettes and can't be bothered to buy new ones.
This is not my first try but I feel like I need something new in my life and I remember the feeling of having a bit more energy and being able to breathe better and I want that. 
Also I'm getting tired of putting a lot of money into smoking.
I've been a bit stressed and anxious lately and used that as a reason to smoke even more when I should be going through my stuff.
I'm tired of being depended on cigarettes and I don't think they are helping me with my mental health even though they calm me down for a little while.
I haven't told anyone yet that I've quit, not even the people I live with ( they are luckily smoke free ) maybe I'm afraid that I can't do it and I will let myself down and others.
I'm not feeling too confident yet, already anxious when I will get a craving. 
Well it doesn't hurt to try.

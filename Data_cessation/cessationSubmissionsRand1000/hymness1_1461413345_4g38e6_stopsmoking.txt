4 months, no cheating, and everything is mostly fine!

Today I'm celebrating my 4 months of smoke-free life! I'm pretty proud of myself, and it's easier than I thought.

I used Zyban for the first month and a half, I'm not sure it was working, the first month was like hell. Everything went back to normal when i stopped using this drug.

Yesterday I went at the bar with my friend. I quit because he quit, one month before me. It didn't work for him. He was there in front of me smoking his cigarettes, and it wasn't even remotely hard at all for me.

I think I'm free. Sometimes it still bugs me. For a short moment of time, I get angry for having quit. Not that I feel the urge to smoke, just that... I don't know :P But for the most part...

I'm free :)

Thanks /r/stopsmoking, you've been a part of this :)

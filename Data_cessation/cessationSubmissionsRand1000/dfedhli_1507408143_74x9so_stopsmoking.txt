I have arrived at 0mg in my vape!

After a long, sometimes difficult, taper I am pleased to announce I have arrived at 0mg and am jumping off the nicotine. In a few days the last of the nicotine in my system will be excreted and I'll have officially taken care of the nicotine devil. New goal: vape the 0mg less and less until I don't vape at all.

Wish me luck!

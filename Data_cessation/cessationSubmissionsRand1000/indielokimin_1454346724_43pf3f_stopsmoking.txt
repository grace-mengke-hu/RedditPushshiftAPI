Tip: If you want to quit smoking lay off the booze

As we all know, alcohol lessens your inhibition, but it's also a huge trigger for people who like to burn a cig after having a few. Nothing is more difficult than attempting to quit smoking while remaining a social drinker. You might not smoke when you're sober, but smoking every time you're drunk is a bad habit alone, and has more debilitating consequences. It took me over 20 times to get to where I am (45 days), and I was only able to make it this far once I stopped drinking altogether. I was able to make this decision because I realized that in all the times I relapsed they all involved me with a bottle in my hand. So if you want to save your lungs, give your liver a rest too. It will suck, but it will pay off in the long run.

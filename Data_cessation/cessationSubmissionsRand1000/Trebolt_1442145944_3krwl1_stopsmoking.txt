Yesterday i realized, that quitting was the best thing i ever did!

I'm a passionate longboarder and i live in a small town in germany and we have this road only for bikes, boards, rollerblades and stuff. and its about 30km long, the time before i quitted smoking was horrible, i could only skate ~9km and now, almost 20 days without a single puff i managed to skate the whole road! needed to do 2 little pauses (halfway in and 3/4) but hey! :) i'm so proud that i finally managed to do it! 

Now let's do some sports, get in shape and live a better life! :)

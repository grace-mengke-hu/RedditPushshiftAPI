I'm so livid right now.

I quit 6 days in advance of my original quit date by reading that Allen Carr book. I've had next to no withdrawal symptoms, and the morning sickness has eased up quite a bit. This isn't what I'm mad about though. 

My husband was supposed to quit smoking as well and supposedly did... Until his brother ratted him out to me today. I realize that I can't make him quit and he has to come to that decision on his own. I'm mad because he broke his promise to me that he'd quit and stay quit. (He's aware I'm mad and doesn't seem to care much, but bottling it up right now isn't going to make me feel better.) 

I just don't know what to do right now short of launch Kindle on my phone, sit him down, make him read the book, and hide his cigarettes. Like it'll do any good though. Ugh.

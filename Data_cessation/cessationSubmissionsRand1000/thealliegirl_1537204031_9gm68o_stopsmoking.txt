Day 4 of being a NON-smoker and the struggles are REAL!

This is ***beyond*** challenging. I'm 32, a smoker for 16 years. This is my first GO on quitting ever. 

&amp;#x200B;

Day one was simple, keep myself busy.

&amp;#x200B;

I downloaded *Smokefree* app.  It's helpful with adding in journal entries and logging cravings. Seeing the time, I've been smoke free makes me want to keep going. The saving money too and health aspects are helpful too. 

&amp;#x200B;

Day two, woke up crying. Knowing a quick trip to the store and $10, would solve my problem but fought through the temptations. I was in a funk all day and couldn't keep tears out of my eyes. I took a nap and when I woke up, some friends had invited me out to a comedy club. I need that. A good laugh and distraction. While there, one friend had asked me to join her for a cigarette. My friend declined for me, as I probably would of jumped on the chance (and after having a drink) but I thanked my friend for reminding - I need to say NO!

&amp;#x200B;

Day three, cleaned the day away. I felt like I had to be productive to prevent another melt down on being a non-smoker and fighting the cravings. I washed my car and made sure to get all the ash and smoke smell out to my best ability. *I smoked heavily in the car*.  I took some time after cleaning and enjoy the sunshine, was nice to relax and got some fresh air... that truly smells good. Later, I went to a friend's house and talked to them about quitting smoking, one of them is a social smoker and another, who I had no idea was smoking, admitted she's fully addicted and buying packs often these days. No one smoked in front of me but after leaving, I wanted one BADLY! Even asked my friend, "Can I go buy a pack, have one, and I'll give you the pack to hold onto?" She said no. I even though about it after dropping her off at home but held strong. I then realized, I did not have on the patch while at the friend's house and put it on as soon as I got home. 

&amp;#x200B;

Things I'm doing to help myself through this progress:

* listening to a sleep hypnosis podcast at night 
* using the patches
* talking about it with loved ones
* keeping busy, with cleaning and organizing 
* Using the app to keep myself accountable

And here's to day four - thank you for reading and hopefully it helps or you can relate. You aren't alone but **YOU ARE BIGGER THAN THIS!**

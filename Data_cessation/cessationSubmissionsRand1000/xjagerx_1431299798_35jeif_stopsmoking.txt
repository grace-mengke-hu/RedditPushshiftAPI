Today I cried four times and punched a wall twice and made it through my second day.

According to Quit It, it's now been exactly 48 hours since my last cigarette (although I resent that, as I had ONE shortly before writing [this ranty mental breakdown the other day](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/35bvp0/i_dont_want_to_quit_but_i_have_to_quit_for_work/) so in my heart, if not reality, it's day 3) and life is hell. 

I have cried more today than I have in the last few years combined. For the first time in my life, I punched the wall out of sheer frustration. I was able to get some work done, although it was only 384 of the 5,000 words I have due on Tuesday. I feel sick and my head is pounding. I skipped a good friend's birthday party because I knew if I left the house I'd crack and buy a pack. Today is honestly the most fucking miserable I have ever been in my life. 

And yet, despite trying to rationalise it all day long, I have not gone to the shop which is round the corner and bought a pack of cigarettes. Despite knowing that freedom from all this is a few bucks and three minutes away, I haven't smoked. I'm proud of that, I really am, but days like today - of sheer depression, anger, and being unproductive -- aren't a viable long term solution to not smoking. 

I hope that something changes when I wake up in the morning, because the only thing worse than smoking is facing another day like today. I don't even want to quit, and could probably survive the 3-4 day chunks I'd have to be smoke free at work with a patch, but I thought I'd try. Going through these sensations when you weren't looking forward to quitting, excited about quitting, and have no motivation for quitting rather using a vape/NRT for a few days at a time, is torture. 

But still, I defeated today. I guess that's something. Who knows what tomorrow will bring.

Was told it's not the smoking sensation that I miss but the nicotine instead.

Hey I get it nicotine is super addictive but isn't possible for me just to miss smoke from a cigarette going into my lungs. Can't I honestly just miss that feeling. If it's just the nicotine I miss then why do others trying to quit using the patch or gum or even a vape with nicotine in it relapse back to full on smoking again?  Riddle me this quitters!

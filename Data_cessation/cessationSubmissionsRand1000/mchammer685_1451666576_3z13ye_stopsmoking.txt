90 days nicotine free! I'll put my stats in the comments if any of the new year resolution folk need some motivation.

So far I've saved $373 (and our family has saved double that since my wife quit too). 

I've not smoked 1356 cigs. 

I've saved 5 days and 15 hours (time I've not wasted smoking a cig) 

And my pulse rate, oxygen levels, carbon monoxide levels, circulation, and breathing are all at the level of a non smoker. 

You can do it!

+100 time quiting

This is the first time I've posted here. I don't really know what to write as I've tried and failed over the last 3 years so many times. Where do I start???

Some background is that I quit smoking around 13 years ago for 10 YEARS. How did I start again? Well all it took was a week away on holiday, few few drinks to be social every night, then the odd cigarette just with a beer, turned into buying a pack to smoke the next day. I WAS HOOKED AGAIN.

I quickly switched to an E-cig, thinking I'll be able to get off these easily. But little did I know it has been far harder that coming off normal cigarettes. 

For the last 3 I've  been going between using patches and  E-cigs. I have had a month smoke free at best, but I always fail.

The trouble is that I can always just think it's just one wee E-cig to get my through that hour. I can smoke and my wife won't find out, I seek away too the shops and smoke and there is no smell. But I'm still totally hooked on nicotine and get the relief from a craving.

I seem to get so depressed after about 2 weeks and smoke again. It causes a lot a trouble with my wife as the see's that I'm never getting of the patches. I always causes arguments when she asks how it is going. 

I'm 4 days now smoke free. I'm finding this the hardest 4 days trying to quit. Maybe because I know this is my last chance to quit before I start a new job with lower wages, so I don't want to waste money on my nicotine addiction. 

Sorry for the long post

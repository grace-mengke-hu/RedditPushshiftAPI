80

Goodness me, it's been 80 days. 

I'll tell you what, I've had a few moments where I would've caved if someone offered. What a scary thing! Serves as a reminder that we need to put ourselves in good situations.

I want you all to know that you inspire me every single day. I know that if you can make it through day 3, day 14, day 21... I can make it through that 5 minute craving.

So, here's to you! Ya'll helped me get to day 80 and I'd love for you to come along for the next 25,000 days. In fact, I think I'm gonna need you to. ðŸ˜‰

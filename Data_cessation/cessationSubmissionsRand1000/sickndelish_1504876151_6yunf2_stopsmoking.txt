SUPER close call last night

Yesterday I celebrated 3 weeks smoke free. The last week and half have been smooth sailing. However, I went out for dinner and drinks with a friend last night, and I began obsessing over cigarettes. It basically ruined the evening for me. I couldn't enjoy myself or pay much attention to my friend. Instead, I was distracted by the intensity of my fixation. It was so strong that I was sure I'd cave and buy a pack on the way home, which gave me this horribly disappointed feeling. How I managed to get home and go to sleep with smoking I don't even understand. 

This morning, I feel glad that I didn't smoke, which was expected. However, I feel a bit tired and worn down by the experience. I feel like I had a real battle last night. Honestly, it scares me how difficult it was. I truly do not want to go back to smoking. I want to achieve years smoke free. I don't want to think about it any longer. I don't want it to be a part of my world.

Nevertheless, I'm entering the last week of my first month as a non-smoker. I look forward to completing this milestone. I'm going to be very careful not to hang out with smokers or allow myself more than a drink or two. Thanks for letting me vent!

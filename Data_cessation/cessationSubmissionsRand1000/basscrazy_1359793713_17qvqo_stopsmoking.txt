Two weeks today! 

So I've hit the fourteen day mark. Feeling fuckin' amazing. Did an 8.5km, 300m hill climb today (thats up to the top and back, pretty steep) and felt great. I've ran 50km in the last week. I feel fucking awesome.

Whoever is quitting smoking, take up running. It makes you feel great, and you can see improvement every day you run. It's brilliant.

As usual, thank you r/stopsmoking, you guys are all an inspiration, and have helped me immensely. I nearly had a moment of weakness the other day. A girl I was hitting on at a bar was smoking, and offered me one. I was almost about to take it, and then thought "Fuck that, that means I'll be right back to day one when I report back to r/stopsmoking." So I didn't take it, and just ended up taking her home and fucking her brains out. Cheers guys!

3 weeks in, feeling the first days after quitting were the easiest

It's getting quite hard for me now, 3 weeks after I quit. I am eating 24/7 and I am far more anxious and stressed than the first days. I need to be doing something at all times, and even if I do I feel anxious. I guess I didn't even believe in myself the first days, and I somehow thought I was going to smoke again sooner or later. But now that I am starting to think that maybe I am actually quitting, my body starts asking for nicotine so fucking hard, wanting to regain the cigarrete after coffee, in the work break and so on. I am walking on the thinest ice right now, right here.

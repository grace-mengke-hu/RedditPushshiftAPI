Dreams of failure?

So, lately, despite me keeping my vows and not having smoked a single cigarette for 223 days, especially in the last week i've been having dreams where I smoke up to 5 cigarettes in a single *episode* I don't remember what exactly happens in these dreams but i do remember old friends and a "one cig won't get me addicted again" mental state. Is this common? Is this the last step towards salvation? 

In my waking life I haven't had trouble staying away, despite having smokers all around me.

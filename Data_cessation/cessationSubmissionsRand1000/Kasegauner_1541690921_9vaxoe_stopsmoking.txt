Six Months, I really can't believe it.

Six months ago I had my last cigarette after 15 years as a smoker. I will never "need" one again. I get to be a non-smoker for the rest of my life, and that feels really good. 

In September I started a Couch to 5K program, and this morning my fat ass actually ran two whole miles without stopping. I’ve never done that before in my life, not even in school. For a perpetually overweight kid like me, that’s huge. I’m pretty proud of myself and just wanted to brag a little.

Quitting smoking and plan for it

Hi guys,I am a half a pack smoker for 6 months and I want to quit.My main reason for quitting is that I don’t want to smoke and then risk it affecting my stamina as I love playing football and would be willing to give up anything for it.I started quitting 5 days ago and yesterday I smoked 5 sticks and today I am on my 4th.My reason for smoking is because it makes me less depress and more awake during the day.I already ordered 2 bottle of caffeine pills and hoped it can keep me awake during the day so that I would make my boss angry.I also bought a lightbox to use it when I first reached office and so at night I can go to sleep.I don’t want to masturbate and smoke anymore,I will do what it takes to quit both of these

[2 Months] Checking in and Feeling Weird.

Well, all, 2 months have hit now, and generally I'm feeling better. Although, last night and today, I feel a bit of a craving. I'm feeling kind of low right now because of work, and I think that's what causing me to have this issue. Any one have an idea of what I can do to feel better without breaking? I'm going to the gym after work and working on a costume, but still.

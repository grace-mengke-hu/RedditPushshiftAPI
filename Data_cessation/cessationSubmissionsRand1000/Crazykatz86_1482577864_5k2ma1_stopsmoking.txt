Day 13

So I was really nervous about going out for the first time since not smoking.  My husband and I ha da brief conversation before we went out to establish that no matter what we would not but a pack of cigarettes even if we were just going to have just one.  There would be no just one cigarette just tonight. There would be no bumming cigarettes off of anyone else.  I've lost to many quits to the idea that I can have just one just tonight.  I think I'm doing much better this time around

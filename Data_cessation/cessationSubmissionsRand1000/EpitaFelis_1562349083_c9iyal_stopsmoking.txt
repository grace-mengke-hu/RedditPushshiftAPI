Damnit, I slipped.

It's festival season, I met an old friend, she's a smoker, I asked her for one without thinking. It was nearly automatic. First it tasted weird, then good, then I felt slightly sick.
That was two hours ago, and while I didn't have another urge, I can't stop thinking about it either. I'm so scared this will affect my progress badly. I want to be done this time.

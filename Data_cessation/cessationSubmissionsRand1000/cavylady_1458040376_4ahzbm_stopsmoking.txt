Help! Day 6 and I am giving up nicotine gum today.

Quit last Thursday and I have been using nicotine gum which really helps, 2mg gum 3-4 times a day. But I need to be 100% nicotine-free. I have seen people chewing gum for years. So I am off it today. I have a quiet day working from home, no stress. Yet I feel super nervous about quitting 100%. Anyone have any experience of coming off nicotine replacement?

Can't sleep, stressing about something dumb.

I tried to start my car today and of course the battery is dead. It was too late in the day to go to an auto parts store and check it. I had my brother come over, help me realize that in fact it must be the battery, but I still worry. I feel as if the stress is killing me.

This is one of the reasons I smoked for so damn long. I couldn't shut my mind off, I had to chain smoke. I don't know if its always been this way or if it was just when I started smoking. This little stress has caused me to completely not be able to relax until I'm able to solve the problem.

The issue isn't even that big of a deal... Really I know it's just the battery, which is something I can flipping replace with just a small fee and the battery is ready to be retired since I've had it since 2007. The issue is that even the littlest bit of stress causes me to freak the fuck out. I guess people who don't smoke stress out too, and even the littlest bit of car stress is a pain in the ass.

Really, I needed a damn place to vent. Smoking will not make this problem magically disappear, but just make me feel like shit and sad that I fucked up. Over the last 7 hours I've had to tell myself over and over again that smoking is stupid and it will NOT fix a damn thing.

Thanks for letting me vent. This too shall pass.

Day 4

I have made it three days so far and am currently halfway through my fourth. The first two days weren't too bad but I am really suffering now. My mood has deteriorated and I am constantly irritated. For myself and for the well-being of my housemates and work colleagues, when can I expect the cravings to die down or become less frequent? Thanks!

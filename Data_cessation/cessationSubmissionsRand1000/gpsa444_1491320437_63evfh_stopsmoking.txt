Nicotine 100% gone

So, the nicotine is 100% gone, according to Smoke Free app. I guess that means that it's only the big monster that I'm up against now. 😐 At least now it's one-on-one!  

The recommendations here for the app and Allen Carr's books have been very helpful. Working on staying resolved.

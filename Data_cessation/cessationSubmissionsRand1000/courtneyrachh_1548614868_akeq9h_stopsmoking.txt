Been trying to quit for months to no avail

alright y’all, I am desperate. 

I’ve been smoking for the last decade. I quit for health reasons five years ago only to take the habit back up a year later. I’ve tried everything I can think of, no drinking, patches, gum, keeping myself busy, eating a mint, setting a timer, etc but I keep failing. It’s killing me inside to know that I’ve completely changed all of my other bad habits but can’t seem to shake this one. I only last five or six days before giving in.

At this point, I am desperate for any and all advice on how I can ACTUALLY quit for good.

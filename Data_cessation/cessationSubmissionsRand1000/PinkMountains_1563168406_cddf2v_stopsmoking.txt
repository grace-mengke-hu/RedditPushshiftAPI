ONE YEAR TODAY!!!

I promise it can be you! I’m so fucking excited and proud of myself. 

I realized today because I was at a bar where a ton of people were smoking. I still think to myself “smoking looks fun” but I know logically it would be gross to actually do it and it’s terrible for me and addictive as hell. And I was like, I think it’s been a year! I checked my app and hell yeah it was!

Anyway, my advice: not one puff ever! and tbh, I had to quit drinking too. It sucks for a while but it stops sucking and it’s so nice to not be controlled.

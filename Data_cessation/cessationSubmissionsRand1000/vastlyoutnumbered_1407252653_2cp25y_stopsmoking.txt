So when can I start bragging?

Hi guys, so coming up for three weeks now and I'm feeling good. I've been exposed to social drinking situations, high stress situations and deliberately exposed myself to situations where I would normally light up. I've successfully defeated my cravings and remained smoke and nicotine free.

I want to start telling people that I've quit and bask in some of the glory but after three weeks I don't want to look like a tool, I have no idea what's around the corner. Watdo /r/stopsmoking?



Edit: Thanks guys, time to make a post a FB status!

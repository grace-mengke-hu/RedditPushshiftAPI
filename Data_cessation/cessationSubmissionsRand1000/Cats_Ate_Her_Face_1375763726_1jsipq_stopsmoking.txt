Lucky number 13? Not so much on day 13. Stupid emotional rant inside.

After kind of a crappy evening, I got hit with a super craving.  Now I'm sitting here crying, feeling like a complete asshole because I'm crying over a craving.

I still haven't caved though.  I guess that's worth something.

I'm just feeling sorry for myself, I guess.  I haven't really told anyone that I've quit.  I can't just announce it on Facebook, because my family doesn't know that I smoked, and I care that much about appearances and all of that bullshit.  I don't feel like my husband's being supportive, but with the way things have been going lately I don't really blame him.

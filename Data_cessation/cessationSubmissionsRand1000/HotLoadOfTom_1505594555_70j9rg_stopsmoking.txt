I feel good about this quit! 4 weeks no smoking 3 weeks no nicotine.

I used the patch for a week to get into the habit of not smoking at work and build a routine. I feel different about this quit. I have even began drinking and getting drunk without smoking. I feel like getting drunk is the ultimate test for ex smokers. I am very proud of myself. But, last time I quit it was for a month so I know not to let my guard down. Exercise is what I did differently this time. I recommend if you're quitting just go for a jog after work or when you have cravings take a walk.

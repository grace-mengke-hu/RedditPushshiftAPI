My last cigarette was 8:30am on Monday, august 7th

Obligatory "Ive posted here a thousand times before."

It was a hell of a weekend leading up to that Monday.

That Sunday night I decided to quit on Monday. Of course, Monday morning came, and the pack was still on my desk. I grabbed it on my way out the door.

I smoked a cigarette that morning. It was a brand I didnt even really like.

Within 5 minutes I got a headache. My whole body screamed dude nooooo and I felt like garbage. You know. Like you do sometimes when you smoke a cigarette.

I said out loud what the fuck am I doing and threw the pack out the window.

It takes a long time to reassess your relationship towards something. Cigarettes used to be cool and made me feel dangerous; young wanna be bad boy shit.

But if I smoke, I don't lift, and if I don't lift I don't get stronger. If I smoke I don't get cooler; I get weaker.

Smoking leads to smoking, lethargy, and eventual cancer. Not smoking leads to... not smoking, more energy, funds, and eventually, confidence.

Don't rely on your willpower. Rely on the plan. The plan works. And the plan is obvious: Just don't smoke.

Day 9, weird dreams.

I've been having non-stop dreams about me being at a party or a friends house and lighting up with him/them. In the dream after I'm done with the cigarette I feel like a total piece of shit and a failure. But then I wake up shortly and realize it was just a dream, and that I'm still clean.

Kind of a positive mind-fuck I guess? Anyone else experience this?

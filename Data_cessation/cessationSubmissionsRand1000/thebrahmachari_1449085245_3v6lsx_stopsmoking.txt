I have smoked 250 cigarettes in my entire life. Will I have erectile dysfunction from this?

Background: HS XC runner, really active until I got to college. Got busy and lazy, put on ~30 lbs in college. Smoked for 6 months, a pack about every two weeks, and lost the 30 lbs by smoking and not eating. I'm scared now that the next time I want to have sex, I won't be able to get it up. Is this all in my head or do you think I have done damage?

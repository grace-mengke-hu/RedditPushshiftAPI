Badge upgrade!? I've finally done it!

I missed my one week mark! and my badge is cooler looking! I'm gonna wear this thing with pride. This community is amazing. It's shit like this that makes me love reddit. Sure I may waste time on it, but on the other hand, it got me to quit cigarettes. And that's gotta count for something.

Day 1 complete

I quit smoking [yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/4ef0ur/will_not_smoke_again/) and I have been waiting to post this since the last one hour.  I successfully stayed smoke free for the first 24 hours. There are no major cravings and I crossed the first major mental barrier on my way to work in the morning. That is the time I smoke daily and I often take smoke breaks at work. But not today. I will continue to post my progress here. Thanks for reading this.

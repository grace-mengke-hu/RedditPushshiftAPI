Resetting my badge after a two-week long relapse

I thought I could handle being an occasional smoker like I used to be. It started with me asking for a drag. Then I bummed one and then another. Then I bought my own pack and another and another. And soon enough, I was back to smoking full-time. I underestimated nicotine's power. I really learned my lesson.

What makes it worse is I'm not allowed to smoke because it activates an enzyme that digests my schizo meds faster and lowers the level in the blood. Smoking made me more anxious which made me smoke even more. Shit cycle.

Now I've bought e-liquid with nicotine again (I was vaping 0mg for a while there) and have managed to make the transition oday. This morning was my last cigarette.

Wish me luck for this time!

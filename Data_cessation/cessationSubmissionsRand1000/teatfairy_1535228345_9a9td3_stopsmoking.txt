Bought a pack. Ugh

But I have not smoked!! Things have been kind of hectic lately (school starting, I start a new job soon, etc) and my brain is still trying to go right back to that coping mechanism. 

I also just got done back from a vacation and the whole time I was there I was fighting the urge to bum a smoke. i have no idea why! 

I won't be throwing them away but I will give them to a friend who has not decided to quit yet.

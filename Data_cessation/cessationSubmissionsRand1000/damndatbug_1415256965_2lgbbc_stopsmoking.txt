I managed to make it to day 3

I had a huge craving yesterday (posted here), and I've managed to overcome it. To be honest, I felt like I'll step on someone's head. The interesting thing, however, is that after that I didn't feel to smoke anymore. Not even the morning cigarette. Is this it? I must be doing something well..

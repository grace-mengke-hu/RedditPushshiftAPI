1825 days (5 years) without smoking

What a milestone. I never thought I could get this far. During the first 2 years it felt like if I could mess it up anytime. I still had some cravings but never allowed myself to take a single hit. And now, I can't even stand the smell of cigarette smoke and the idea of smoking is as compelling as swimming in a pool of shit.

I want to thank this subreddit. Reading your stories was crucial to my success.

Caffeine cravings have spiked. Anyone know why?

So I caved recently. Before Christmas I spent about a week smoking weed and tobacco mixed joints recreationally.

After Christmas I was preparing for exams and stress/anxiety got the better of me. I have ADHD and my medication dose was increased recently. I also was avoiding taking any of my emergency supply of benzos during this time to help with the panic attacks/anxiety because they made me useless at studying. In desperation I rolled myself a cigarette and proceeded to smoke 10 a day for two weeks throughout the exams. 

As usual I gave myself and everyone around me all of the excuses. But somehow I managed to stick to my word.

The day of the last exam, I walked out had a cigarette and stopped again.

That was just under three weeks ago. It was probably the easiest quit I've ever done. I was anticipating it being a repeat of before. Somehow however since quitting I've noticed a genuine craving at about 11am everyday. This is usually the type of craving I'd get for a smoke but somehow this is satisfied quite well with a strong cup of coffee. Genuinely I'm associating the craving more with coffee and less with nicotine as the days go on.

I do drink tea daily and coffee maybe a few times a week but I'm not one who's "useless without my coffee".

I find it strange to feel this type of intense physical craving for coffee. Can anyone suggest what it is? Maybe just a stimulant effect resulting in a combination or nicotine, caffeine and my meds ?

Anyway, I'm happy to be a nonsmoker again. Feels so much better. Although I infrequently indulge in cannabis I think I'll be avoiding tobacco at all cost, I just can't trust my head to not get hooked

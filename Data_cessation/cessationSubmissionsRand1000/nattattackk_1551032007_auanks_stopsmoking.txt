What’s the furthest you’ve gone for a smoke?

This was a really interesting question in today’s mission on day 21 lol and it got me thinking. I’ve done some pretty extensive things. I remember once I was driving (number 1 place for me to smoke) and my lighter fell under the seat. I almost got into an accident trying to get it on the highway. 
Ridiculous. I’ve pulled out soggy ones from under car seats, I fished them out of the garbage. It feels pathetic now, that I let it have such power over me. Anyone else care to share?

First post #day17

This reddit and its users made me create a redditaccount! Using the app Smoke Free (actually the paid version because, hell, saved 70 euros allready).

Last year I quited for 1 month, but sneaked a lot of sigarettes in the weekends. This time I am more serious and committed to stay a non-smoker (love calling myself a non-smoker :) ). 

Apart from feeling like I might cry all the time, I actually don't really have a lot of cravings!   
So yeah, that's it for my first reddit post. Keep up the good work, and let us not smoke tonight together.

hey!

So its me Alec again. I smoked my last cigarette today or atleast I hope so. Tomorrow is gonna be the first test. I told myself: "If that Allen Carr dude is right, then I should not feel compelled to smoke as much if I just skip that first cigarette in the morning." So thats what I`m gonna do. I hope that in the long run if I ever feel compelled to light up, I can come here for moral support and reasons not to. So far I have only posted once on this sub reddit and that one post actually helped quite a bit. So lets hope I can do this!

See you all soon!

Dreaming

Does anybody know at what point do I stop dreaming about smoking?  Last night I dreamt that I finally lit up and was really pissed that I had to reset my Smoke Free app.  The other night I dreamt that my 8 y/o was smoking and we were cool with it, but were afraid he was going to burn down the house.  WTF?

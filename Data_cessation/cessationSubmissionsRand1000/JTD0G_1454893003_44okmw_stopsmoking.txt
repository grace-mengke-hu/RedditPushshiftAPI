I've quit smoking to fart, get acne and mouth ulcers.

So I've quit smoking since New year. Not a resolution or anything, I broke my arms and the doc told me to stop. So it was a quick cut down and over the last two weeks I've had none. Now I've got one painful ulcer, spots are back, awful gas and constant hunger! Not, going back after this. Smoking really messes you up.

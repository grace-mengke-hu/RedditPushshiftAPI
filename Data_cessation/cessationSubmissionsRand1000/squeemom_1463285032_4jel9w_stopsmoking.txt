And then there's that.

So.  I had a slip tonight.  Things were going ok.  They really were.  I was SUPER irritable.  And I might have had a panic attack which I think was due to low blood sugar today (apparently I need to eat more frequent smaller meals when I'm a non smoker? Or drink juice.  Maybe I should be drinking the juice.). Honestly though, I wasn't feeling all that bad.  The nicotine lozenges were taking care of all but a little tiny bit of the physical stuff.  For me it's all mental right now. 

There was a surprise party for my best friend tonight.  She's one of my remaining smoking friends and she just happens to be the person I started my habit with a whole 20 years ago.  I kept saying it was a bad idea to go.  I left the house to go anyway.  I bought a pack of cigarettes.  If I was gonna go down I was gonna be "in control" of it.  I tripped over a mental hurdle and decided I was gonna smoke until my ecig arrived.  For the sake of my family members.  So I wouldn't be so mean.  (STUPID EXCUSES ARE STUPID!!!!) I smoked one and then I got a text from another friend before I even got to the bar.  She's pregnant and she wanted me to take her e-cig stuff.  And that was the end of that relapse before it even got off the ground.  I went to get the stuff and I threw the cigarettes out the damn window.  (Yes.  I littered.)  I didn't end up going to bar.  I sent my BFF an apology and headed home.  It's not time for me to go drinking yet.

I'm resetting my thought process.  For some reason I had in the back of mind that I needed to slip.  I needed to be reminded of why I quit.  But it really wasn't necessary.  I was doing just fine before and I'll be doing just fine tomorrow.  LET'S DO THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!

P.S. Cigarettes taste gross.  And I got immediately congested.  Like 5 minutes after I smoked it my nose was stuffed up and my throat was thick with crud.  It sucked.

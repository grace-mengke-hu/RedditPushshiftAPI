Today is a great day not to smoke

Yes, it is.

What I have learned so far:

1. Don't fight or trade with yourself. Just don't smoke.
2. Don't define yourself as a quitting smoker, but as a person not related to smoking in any way.
3. Don't *try* not to smoke, make a conscious decision not to smoke today.
4. Don't make it forever. Just don't smoke today.

Today is a great day not to smoke.

Hope that helps.

EDIT: About *today* vs *forever*.

It is usually a very hard decision to change your life *forever*. Like getting married or moving to another country. And lots of deep fears are getting to the surface.

You don't have to fight them. You don't quit *forever*. You are just not smoking *today*.

That helped me once to quit for 3 years.

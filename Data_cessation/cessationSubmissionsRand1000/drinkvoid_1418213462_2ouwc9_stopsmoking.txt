Progress of replacing cancer sticks with fitness

3 months ago, when I quit, I started to replace my habit with some healthy exercise instead. For the first month I tried running, but to be honest, that faded quite quickly, running just isnt my thing (at least as a fitness tool for 3-4 times a week). 

So instead, starting the 2nd month of my quit,  I got into bodyweight exercises and they were way more up my alley for several reasons (can be done at home, no financial investment, etc...)

I took a photo of my progress every Wednesday and today was the first time I compared images. I am sure you can bulk up way quicker than I did if you set your mind to it, but man I was impressed with myself nonetheless. Here, [have a look](http://i.imgur.com/xPCkItR.jpg) (semi-NSFW). The first time in my life I can clearly see that I have made a fantastic decision for myself. It absolutely shows. Cigs/Cannabis held me back for SO LONG.

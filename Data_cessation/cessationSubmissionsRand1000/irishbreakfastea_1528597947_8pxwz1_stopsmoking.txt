Needing support

I have been going on this up and down roller coaster for months.  Stopping and starting.  It's exhausting.  I want to quit again.  I have the gum even.  I am upset that I keep going back.  I'll flush my cigs down the toilet before going to bed, swearing to never smoke.  Then in the morning, before I even make my tea, I am off to the store to buy a pack.  It's been on repeat like this for a while.  I will not accept failure, I keep trying.  But god damn guys, I am struggling.

Just needing some support.  I will not stop trying. thank you

Finally ready to do this.

Hey guys, just wanted to introduce myself, as I'm sure I will be here leaning on you for support. After 10 years of heavy tobacco and marijuana use, I've finally decided to give them both up. (yesterday..) 

I smoke cigarettes all day at work, and then come home and mix tobacco and pot and smoke spliffs all night. I know that quitting smoking is pretty tough - I once quit for 6 months, only to foolishly think that I could puff an occasional cig now that I'd "kicked the habit". I'm especially nervous to quit both of my vices cold turkey, because I will be withdrawing from 2 different drugs.

The reasons for me quitting are varied... but my main concerns are health and money. I'm a cyclist... why the fuck would I smoke anything? I'm pretty strong and in good shape, and I feel like the exercise has kept the worst effects of the smoking at bay, but it will catch up to me. How much stronger/faster will I be when I've finally kicked it for good? I've been with my GF for over 5 years. I really want to ask her to marry me, but I spend all of my extra money on pot and cigs. It's pretty pathetic, but I'm probably spending close to $300 a month on this shit, and I can't save any money because of it. We live comfortably, but extra money goes to smoking in some form or another. 

In the end, it's obvious to me that the drawbacks of smoking outweigh the "positives" - all of which are an illusion or a lie I tell myself. I know what I'm in for more or less, but would love to hear from anyone who has successfully quit pot and cigs at the same time.

Have a good day everybody =)

Passed the ultimate test, food and drinks

2 weeks in, had the ultimate test yesterday. Went out for food, and then  a couple of beers. 
Forgot all about it while eating, had a 1minute craving after the 2nd beer but nothing that insane.

Looks like not smoking is starting to settle in. 

Come join me for a smoke free ride people!

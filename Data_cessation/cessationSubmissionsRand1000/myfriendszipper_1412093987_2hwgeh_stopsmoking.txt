Does anyone else really like the smoking dreams?

I totally love that when I smoke in a dream, I wake up feeling guilty as shit, and then realize I didn't actually smoke and am very relieved. Its like reassurance that even just one cig totally nulls my progress, and that I would definitely regret it if I ever did give into the temptation.

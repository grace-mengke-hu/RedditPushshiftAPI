Planning to quit. Need advice on how to prepare!

I need some advice on how to mentally prepare to quit smoking.

 I've been smoking 2 packs a day for 16 years. The only time I've been able to quit was about 10 years ago when I got on Wellbutrin. I lasted 2 months until I got drunk at a party, lit up, and was right back to 2 packs a day. I've tried to quit many times since then, but never made it more than a few hours. 

I'm starting Wellbutrin tomorrow and going to try again after I've been on it for a few days. This time around, I have 3 little stressors (my spawn) to contend with. I really don't like being a parent, and my porch is my only quiet, clean space where I can be away from their noise and the wake of destruction that they leave all over the house.

If I'm not chain smoking on my porch, how do I deal with reality? I have a feeling that if I continue to come out to the porch to escape, it will be a strong trigger for cravings.

Btw, I've read the Allen Carr book twice, and it did nothing for me. 

Also, for those of you who took Wellbutrin/Zyban to quit, how long did you take it, and was it difficult to taper off of? (I quit taking it cold turkey 10 years ago with no problems, but my body chemistry is a lot different now.)

Have quit for more than 2 weeks, but still grumpy, sleepy, anxious, hostile. Is this normal?

Today for example I already had two 40 minute naps in addition to 7.30 hours of sleep. Yesterday i slept almost 12 hours! I am wondering when can I expect all to go back to normal? Of course I am happy about not smoking and not feeling "drugged", however I am a bit worried about the whole thing.

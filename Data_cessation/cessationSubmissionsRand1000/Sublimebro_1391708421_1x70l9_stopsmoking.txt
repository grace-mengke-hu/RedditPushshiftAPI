The pros to quitting smoking that I have noticed so far. (9 days)

If you're early in quitting smoking I would recommend making a list like this. It has helped me a ton whenever I crave a cigarette. Just scratch down a few things that you've noticed since you've quit, then whenever you crave a cigarette remind yourself why you don't want one with your list.


* I can smell again! I remember walking into Walmart around day 3 and I could actually smell all of the fruit and vegetables. Amazing feeling.

* Food tastes amazing.

* I have a surprisingly larger amount of energy throughout the day, especially while I'm working out.

* I can breathe easier.

* Higher sex drive, my member works better, and an orgasm feels 5 times better (This one surprised me).

* I don't smell like a cigarette so my confidence is much higher. I'm not always having to chew a piece of gum or be worried about my smell before I talk to a girl.

* The bags under my eyes have disappeared.

* My skin is starting to look healthier.

* Waking up with more energy

* I'm not chained down to a smoking craving every hour.

* I'm saving about $40 a week.


If you're new to quitting just remember that it does get easier, and the cravings do diminish. 

Good luck!

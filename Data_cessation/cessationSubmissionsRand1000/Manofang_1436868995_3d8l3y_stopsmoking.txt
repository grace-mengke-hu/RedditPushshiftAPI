Got my star!!

Today is day 30 without a cigarette and I'm feeling (and breathing) great I come to these posts everyday and read the stories good and bad and they motivate me to not pull into the gas station and for that I say thank you every one that post on here you probably saved my life... I had a weird dream that I was in my old life and smoking again and when I woke up I could taste them in my mouth believe me when I say I died a little inside and then threw up... that was horriblei hope that doesn't happen to often.

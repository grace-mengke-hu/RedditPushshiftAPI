Out of the Smoke-Cloud...

Hi all! In 20 hours I'll have been nicotine-free for two whole weeks. After lurking on Reddit for 5+ years, now is the moment to get involved, for no greater reason than to say a huge thank you to everyone on this sub! Genuinely I've replaced cravings with r/stopsmoking. 

My quit has so far mirrored much of what I've read on here and it's been so useful knowing that other people are experiencing the same things I am, and reading about their success is a huge boost. I've been trying not to avoid triggers as I want to re-programme my brain, but I have been avoiding drinking as I don't feel like I can lower my inhibitions at the moment... However I'm pleased to say that I managed a night out without a smoke. When all the pubs and shops had closed, seeing my friend run out, charging around the local streets in the cold and rain looking for somewhere open, desperate for somewhere to buy a pack, it provided an excellent visual representation of the madness to which cigs can drive you. Just two weeks ago I would've been right alongside him, thinking that was normal. Scary thought.

So thanks again everyone, I wouldn't be at this point without you! Even though it's early days I feel this is the one, especially with all you guys with me. Good luck to you all, and I look forward to contributing in the future.

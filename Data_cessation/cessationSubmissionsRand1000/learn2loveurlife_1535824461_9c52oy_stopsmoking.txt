Just completed day 5 cold turkey. Anxiety,low grade depression,irritation, anger, cravings are noticeable.I'm constantly repeating to myself that "hey just a few more hours then dinner then bed, just hold on.Don't act, hey it's anxiety,come on man you these all are withdrawals and you can do it."

Day 5 was better than day 3. But it is still a very unpleasant and kind of gloomy in my head of course . I am not expecting any miracles from tomorrow morning. I know life is going to suck for a few more weeks. Cigarettes are out of consideration. I need to get rid of this shit man. Being a slave to cigarettes is a real pain in the ass. I need to cry now while listening to music and dancing myself to sleep. Fucccckkkkkkkkkkkk, fuckkkk, fuckkkk, fuckkkk

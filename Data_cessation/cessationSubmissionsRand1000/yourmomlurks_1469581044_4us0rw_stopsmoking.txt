366 Days. You can do it.

I wanted to do a big post at one year but this little one will have to do. 

I played around with tracking my cigarettes smoked, various apps, etc.  This is an important step...just measuring what you want to improve will help.  Admitting you want to quit is huge. 

A year and one day ago my boyfriend had a serious talk with me, about my health, about losing loved ones to cancer, etc. About how we'd been talking about a baby. 

I had been cutting down for awhile, but I finally realized for non smokers, "just one or two" is no improvement...it is the same as an addict saying they only had "a little bit" of cocaine or that there's just "an ounce" of dogshit in the bed.  Smoking is gross. 

The next day I put a patch on my ass and did not look back.  Previously I quit with gum, but after chewing the gum for several years I had to go on the patch to get off the gum so this time I cut to the chase. 

I did the patch for a few days and then quit that too.  

And here I am now, smoke free...and my smoke-free little baby is 13 weeks old :)

You can do this.  Just decide and don't look back.

Also if you want to know how high the mountain is, my boyfriend said I visibly stopped thinking about it/craving around 3 weeks and he knew I was totally done and not going back at 6 weeks.  It's not too bad. You can do it and it is totally worth it!

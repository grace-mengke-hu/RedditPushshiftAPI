Smoking in the winter

I drove past a grocery store today.  There was a woman on break having a cigarette. It was 15 degrees outside with sleet and wind.
She did not look like she was enjoying herself.  
Reason #999 why I don’t miss smoking!!
And as an added bonus smoking in the cold makes you smell even worse.   It’s been a month but this time   Quitting feels so different, so good!!

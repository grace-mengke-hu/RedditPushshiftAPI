Walmart as a non smoker...

Walmart by itself is hell.  I absolutely hate the place. Today I had no choice but to go.  So I gathered myself and prepared for the worst. 
It's the beginning of the month and anyone who has ever been there knows that means complete chaos.  So there I am waiting in this lovely line for what seemed like decades with my tornado of a 2 year old who refuses to sit still and my older child who has this idea we are on a shopping spree and is listing off all the things she wants.  Lord it took all my patience.

 I made it to the front of the line where I was attempting to retrieve a money transfer just to be told that I needed a reference number.  Shit.  So I step aside to handle that. I'm trying to balance my 2 year old who refuses to buckle and make my phone call.  It's so much of a circus that it's almost funny.  I can only imagine what all the people in line are thinking.  But fuck em.  I can't worry about that. So anyways after some work I manage to get everything straight,  pick up the transfer and proceed to quickly grab diapers and run to the registers.  

By the time I get outside I'm about to die. Stress,  embarrassment,  sheer fucking overload.. and I'm greeted by a face full of cigarette smoke. I literally started to cry.  Nothing hysterical, but the tears rolled down my face.  Fuck I'd give anything in the world for a cigarette at that moment....  Anything except the 18 days nicotine free that I've earned... 

So instead I pushed my basket with the tornado 2 year old while my other kid went on and on about some fucking thing, to the car. I managed to get everything unloaded and made my way home.  Man oh man did I want to smoke today,  but I didn't.  

Days like these kill me but they also show me that if I can make it through them without giving in,  that I am better because of it. It isn't easy but it's worth it.  I just can never let myself forget that.

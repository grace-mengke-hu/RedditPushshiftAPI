Lack of sleep on day 5?

Hi all, 

Today marks day 5 for me. Im going cold turkey and cravings have thankfully been easing up. However, last night was probably one of the worst nights I've had so far. No sleep at all. 

I felt pressure mounting in my head(like it's going to explode), oversensitive hearing and my jaw tightens and doesn't want to relax. Deep breathing exercises help but only temporarily. This carried on all night, preventing me from sleep. 

Has anyone else experienced this when giving up?

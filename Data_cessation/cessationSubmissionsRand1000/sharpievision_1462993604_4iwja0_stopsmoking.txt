9 days in

I'm 9 days in and feel good mostly... Except I'm exhausted. Is this quit related? Has anyone else experienced this? My cravings aren't that bad and have greatly decreased in frequency, I just sleep all the time. It's hard to wake up in the morning. Once I get out of bed and get going things are easier though. Any ideas?

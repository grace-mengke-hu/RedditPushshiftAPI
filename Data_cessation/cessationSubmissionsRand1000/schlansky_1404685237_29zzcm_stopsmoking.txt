Will say goodbye to cigarettes on 1st of September 2014!

I have been smoking half my life now (for 13 years) and I am convinced that this is enough!

I will quit after my research project is finished on 1st of September.

Dear Cigarettes, 
Welcome to Dumpsville, population: you


See you guys in September!

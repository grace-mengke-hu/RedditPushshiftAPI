115 days ALREADY! YEAH BABE!

Quit 115 DAYS ago. Am proud of myself. 
And smokers around me, who hear this, pretend like this is not a big fuckin deal. 

Yeah, right! Everytime you have a person like that around you - ask them: When was the last time they lasted 115 minutes without a cigarette? EXACTLY.

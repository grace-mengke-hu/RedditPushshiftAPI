Is it bad I need to hear "Good job!"?

 I tried to quit smoking in March but couldn't deal with the extreme bitchiness and emotional breakdown that happened.  It was mid\-tax season.  

I decided to try again.  I haven't smoked in 20 hours.  I'm listless.  I'm emotional.  I'm just blah.  It finally clicked for me, though.  My SO that was quick to roll his eyes when I'd buy a pack of cigarettes for the past year \(I was going to quit last year and didn't\) hasn't really acknowledged my quit attempt.  He knows it's been 20 hours, which isn't a  long time.  But, for a 24 yr pack a day smoker, it's huge.

It finally dawned on me that one of the reasons I'm so emotional is that I need someone to tell me I'm doing a good thing.  Someone to give me an attagirl. Because this sucks.  It's hard.  I need someone to recognize that.  Maybe it's selfish of me.  But, dammit, I need it.

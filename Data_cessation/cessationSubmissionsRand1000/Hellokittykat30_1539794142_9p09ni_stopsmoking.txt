Since I've quit smoking

My skin has gone to shit
I eat everything in sight
Gained weight
Irritable
I feel almost as if I wander around like a ghost.
My throat is killing me
This fucking cough that I didn't have before.
I can smell everything. 
Crazy ass dreams

This is the worst quit I've gone thru. I feel like I'm getting hit with everything all at once. I feel like shit. I hate everything. Rawr.

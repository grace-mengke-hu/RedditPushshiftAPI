few months in now

Okay, I have been a non smoker or a few months now and I have to confess, when I quit, I really did not think I would actually stop smoking. I had read Alan Carr and had said, Yes, I can do this, but deep inside, I really did not think this would work! I remember after a month of non smoking being really pissed off because I figured that I would have given up by then and started again! Now it was too late and I REALLY HAD NO EXCUSE.  I am so happy that I let myself down by actually quitting! I feel so incredibly better now.  Never underestimate yourself. You really can do this!! I also have to admit that when I had  dream the other day that I was smoking, when I realised that it was a dream I hurried and finished the smoke!! I will never smile again in real life and maybe I am a bad example but I am a non smoker and honestly, if someone like me a quit a pack a day habit after 40 years, you can do it.   Use whatever trickery you need to do it. All is fair in this fight!!!

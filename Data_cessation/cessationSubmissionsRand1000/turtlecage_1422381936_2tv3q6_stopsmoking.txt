Beginning my journey

The last time I quit, I was quit for 10 months. I almost made it one year without smoking, but then I was in a horribly traumatic situation that led me to smoke again. It was my decision, and a dumb one. I threw away my one year mark. 

I want to quit again. I am cutting back before I stop completely. 

Most recently I went 13 hours without smoking. For many of those hours I was napping, but I still count it. 

I am so sick and tired of spending money on these things that only make my life worse. 

Here's to new beginnings. Wish me luck.

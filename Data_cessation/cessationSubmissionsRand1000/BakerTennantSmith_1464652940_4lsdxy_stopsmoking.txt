Hello. It's been a while

So I quit a while back and was doing well. And then I unquit.  Stupid but is what it is. Anyway, I notice at work no one smokes. I don't want to be "that girl" that goes outside to smoke so I typically do not smoke for the 8 hours I am there. So I tell myself I can quit for good. I no longer drink. I meditate. I'm working on caring for myself. It's time for the biggest problem to go. 

So here I am again. Better late than never.

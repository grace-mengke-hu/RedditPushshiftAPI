I miss... the romanticism, what do you use?

First off, I've not caved, I'm still going strong on day 162 and not having any cravings in the classic sense.  Though I do have a nagging sense of romanticism about smoking, a sort of daydream I find myself turning to, I wonder if that's what happens at this stage, when you've taken control, cravings are gone, so you can look back and assess.

Now this man looks like me, similar age, similar philosophical stoicism he turns to when he smokes (as I did).  Seeing him chill on his stairs on a nice day, toking on a pipe (I never smoked pipes, unless for weed), it all makes me nostalgic for the identical times I had with myself...

...I remember those smokes in the cool winter air, where the smoke sat heavy around me when there was no wind, ice white against the blue sky. The intake of breath was both crisp and cool in the morning air, the warmth of the cherry faint against my fingers.  I would ponder, and always relax myself by exploring thoughts, knowing that life wasn't perfect, I wasn't perfect, I had this filthy habbit, but damn did it feel good in the season's embrace...

I'm not religious like this guy, I think he's married with kids which I don't share with him, so we differ on many levels... but when he's sat there, waxing lyrical and considering existence with his trusty pipe, the smell, taste and feel of the moment is so visceral, and I yearn for such moments again ...

What do you guys do to satisfy that sentimental void?

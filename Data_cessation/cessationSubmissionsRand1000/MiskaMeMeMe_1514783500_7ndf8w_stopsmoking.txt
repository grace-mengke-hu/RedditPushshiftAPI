I did an New Year's Quit. You can, too.

I am almost at 1,100 days smoke free. And believe it or not, it gets better every day. Don't think that because it is a 'cliche' to quit on New Years that it is 'OK' to start again. Or that it won't work. IT WILL. No matter when you decide to quit, that is the important day.

And, quitters, if you stumble . . . if you fall and stub your toe, don't despair. Know that quittin' ain't easy and try again when you are ready. It took me a few times before the quit took.

Lastly, buy and read Alan Carr's book. It is amazing. I tried and made it pretty far a few times. But after reading his book I never smoked again.

Good luck, good quitting and happy 2018 to all you /r/stopsmoking out there!!!

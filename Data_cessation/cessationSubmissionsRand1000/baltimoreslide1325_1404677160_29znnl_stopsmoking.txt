My nicotine addition set up "gates" in front of every pleasurable activity. Understanding that is helping me easily resist cravings.

I realized a few days ago that my nicotine addiction had set up "gates" in front of every pleasurable activity in my life.  
  
Pick up a book? Can't enjoy that without a cigarette.   
Pick up your guitar? Can't enjoy that without smoking first.  
Social? Can't enjoy that without a cigarette.  
Etc.  
  
But really what I think is happening here is that these are activities that normally would have released happy dopamine in my brain. 
But my brain doesn't release dopamine normally anymore because I'm a nicotine addict.  
  
The reason I have to smoke before or during any normally enjoyable activity is simply that my brain knows dopamine *should* be released at that time, but it cannot release the dopamine without nicotine. Thus it has set up a "nicotine gate": you want to happiness? Smoke now. And after hundreds of repetitions, my brain just knows the association between the two activities: playing guitar? smoke now.  
  
In order to get the happiness I would have gotten anyway, I now need to pay a nicotine toll.  
  
So: beating cravings on these enjoyable things is just a process of deleting one gate, one tollbooth, after another.  
  
Realizing this has REALLY helped me override some of my strongest and weaseliest cravings over the past few days. Anyone else relate?  
   
Good luck everyone!

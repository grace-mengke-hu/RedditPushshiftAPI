Day 5, i just slipped up.

I dont completely hate myself, but I do. Had a few puffs. Put it out. Tasted like shit. And now I have heartburn of all things.

Is there not some clockwork orange-type therapy I can get into?
I'd gladly sign my life over to such a program right now. Ugh.

On the upside, I chose the cigarette over a baseball bat, so I haven't hurt anyone but myself (yet).

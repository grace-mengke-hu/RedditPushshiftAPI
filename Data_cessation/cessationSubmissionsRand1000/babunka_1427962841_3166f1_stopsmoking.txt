My room smells girlie!

I always thought that real woman smell of flowers and other nice things and I always dreamed to be that way. I dreamed that my SO thinks of me when feeling a beautiful scent. Instead I used to smoke A LOT in my room, when I was young and stupid I even kept my full ashtray in one of my drawers so that my parents wouldn't see it. So gross! Even smoking at the window couldn't stop the stinking cigarette smoke. But now I just had a bath and my room smells of lavender, aloe and all my cosmetics, sooo sweet ^_^!

Lost control... but took it back again.

I failed. On day 215 I failed. It was a very tough day, but it wasnt that tough, not to bare it, it was rather that I have decided to have a smoke. I bought a pack. I had one. And aftee that... it was like my body wanted to catch up for the  7 months. It was like I could smoke 5 cigarettes at once. I smoked half a pack. On the next day I woke up as a smoker. Two with the coffee, one before lunch, one after,one in the afternoon, 4-5 in the evening with a beer.. and on the next day, Saturday, I woke up with heaviness in the chest, coughing my lungs out. I knew that if I don't make myself stop again, I will never stop. Only I know how it felt those two days - the weekend. Coughing and feeling so bad.... But, long walks, a lot of water... I am on the right path again. I didnt change the settings in the apps I use, because I dont want to start from the beginning. I prefer to be a non-smoker with one time off the line. 
Anybody on the same page? I dont feel cravings, I am at the same time disappointed by myself that I slipped, and proud that I managed to take back the control. Should I start the countdown again? Should I delete with a rubber the 7 months... and count again, and say, I am a five-days old nonsmoker? Can't do this.
Any oppinion would help.

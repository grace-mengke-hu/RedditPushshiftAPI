Day 5: ...

Day 5 today. I am the most angry, frustrated, pissed off person in the entire world. I feel like I am going to explode, and actually feel quite faint.

Wen't drinking last night, didn't smoke but the temptation was insane. Had a fight with the wife about something stupid. I kept my cool big time though, so it blew over quite quickly.

This morning I am struggling to keep calm. I have really difficult work to do, and I am struggling with it. On top of that I keep on getting interupted, and on top of that I keep on having to fix a team member's work. Then on top of that there is another work issue, that is incredibly taxing to deal with.

I don't crave a smoke at all. I am just so incredibly angry. I have spoken to our one project manager and told him I'm stepping away from email and his problem for the rest of the day, because I will explode and say things that won't be helpful.

I am putting the hard work on hold and carrying on with other, simpler stuff for the day. Just a few more days and I'll be out of the storm.

It's been a long time since I checked...

Pretty Ill at the moment, viral...Fluish... but it was the first time in years that I saw a medical professional.  She congratulated me on my quit almost 2 years ago.  The support of my family and friends goes far beyond!  Having said that, it felt really good to be told 'Good job' by a perfect stranger.  I'm about to sink into sweet cough syrup slumber but for those still struggling; It is well worth it; and with any hope you will look back and say, HOLY SHIT! That was easier than I thought it could be! Stay song folks, stay beautiful Motherfuckers!

Day 5 - I feel good?

Day 5 for me, I’ve noticed things and wanted to see whether anyone else noticed these things whilst quitting..

- for as long as I remember, I’ve had headaches most days. Sometimes it’s just been there in the very background, but a couple of days each week I’ve had thumping headaches for years. I haven’t had a headache since I quit 5 days ago. This is extremely abnormal for me.

- I have more energy, so much more energy. I’m used to getting home from work, eating and collapsing in bed and doing nothing until I fall asleep as I have no energy. This week I’ve been getting home, doing chores, mowing the lawn and even then still feeling like I can do more? It’s odd, in a good way.

- I can smell everything! Good and bad I can just smell things I couldn’t before.

- my partner hugged me and told me I smelt nice. I wasn’t even wearing perfume!

Today’s a good day. I’m enjoying being a non smoker.

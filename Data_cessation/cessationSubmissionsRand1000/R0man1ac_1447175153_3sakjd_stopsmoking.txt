Almost 48 hours without any nicotine.

I know I'm posting a lot. But it really does help me so that I can come back to the post and remember why I am doing this again. 

Yes, again. I started smoking when I was seventeen. A very dumb idea. Neither of my parents smoked but my grandparents did. I was offered a cigarette by an older guy I had a crush on. Went down hill from there. 

I quit when I was 22, just out of an abusive relationship. I quit for just almost two years. And then one day about a year ago I was driving a friends friend from the airport. Was offered a smoke. And now here we are again on day two of quitting a year later. 

I am going on a family vacation November 26th with my boyfriends family. I have been a closet smoker the last few years. Ashamed that my two years were destroyed in an instant. The last few family vacations have been torturous as we go often and I am finding myself making excuses to step away for the cigarette. 

I know the mistake I made last time was smoking that one smoke after two years. I thought I would be able to handle it. I know better for this time. 

I am done for good. Between the stopsmoking app (which I used the first quit), and the support from this community, I know I won't pick up another cigarette. 

I'm already feeling better. It's easier to breathe, I don't have that smokers cough. I also feel like I have more time for the activities I want to do, instead of smoking when my brain screams at me to.

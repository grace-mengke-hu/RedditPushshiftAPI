Things will get better

111 days without smoking. I Smoked since I was 18 and now I'm 35. A package a day, I was never able to stand more than a week without smoking other times I tried to quite. I thought there was no solution for me. I would be a smoker all my life and that thought used to make sad. Last time I decided to give a shot again, I decided to stay focus and keep it going no matter what. I used to read many people saying that with time cravings would go away. By the first month I was really exhausted because my cravings were not going away. Instead, they looked stronger every day. Nowadays, i still think in cigarette sometimes but not as a craving. Like some nostalgic moment, where I don't want to go back. Like an over relationship that I want to move on from, and I think I finally am being able to move on. All this to say, things will get better. Believe me, I also had trouble to believe when people used to tell me, things will get better.

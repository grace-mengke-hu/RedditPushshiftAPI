Relapse and repeat

Well! With the changing of the seasons from winter to spring and then spring to summer, I found myself having social cigarettes. These remained "social" or, "when I have a beer, I'll have a cig" cigarettes for pretty much this whole time. It escalated from a smoke a beer to, a pack a night if I'm out and drinking with friends.


Last weekend I smoked 2 packs in two nights and I'm just over it... Again. 

Today I guess would be the beginning of day 6 so I want to (regrettably) reintroduce myself to this subreddit. 


I had quit for almost 6 months (dec.-May) and then got back on the smoking train. I went through a lot this past year, and I don't really hate/blame myself for smoking these last couple months. I did what I felt necessary to remain alive and somewhat "happy." 


That being said, I'm starting to feel that my life finally returning to "normal" status and I'm beginning to approach a new beginning in life and hopefully a promising future. 


So, it is time for the 2nd act. Round 2 of quitting smoking. I'm going to re-read Allan carr's book because, even though it was repetitive and boring, it was sort of motivating/inspiring. 


Last time I quit I was a lot more motivated to do so; this time I'm just moving on. Idk if I'll succeed like last time. My heart was way more into it then, but if I've done it once I'll do it again. 

Au revoir

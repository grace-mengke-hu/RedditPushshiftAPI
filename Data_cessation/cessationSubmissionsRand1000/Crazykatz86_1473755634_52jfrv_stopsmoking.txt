2 days no cigarettes

So over the past two weeks I have made 4 attempts at stopping cigarettes. I seem to have this problem though where I reward myself for my good behavior with JUST ONE cigarette.  I am trying to get my resolve in order and tackle this once and for all.  However I must admit working overnight shifts interpreting EKG strips is incredibly boring and lonely definitely making it difficult to keep myself motivated.

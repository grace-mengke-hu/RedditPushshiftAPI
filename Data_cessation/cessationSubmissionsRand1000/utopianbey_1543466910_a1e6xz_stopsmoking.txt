Sad

Relapsed after 40 days. Damn it! Although I am not smoking a pack now like I used to, but still it feels sad that I have to start over. There are some upcoming events in my life right now, they are going to be life changing for me, i think this is the main reason of why I relapsed, I think I will try again after january 1.
Still I am trying make commitment that no more than 2 cigs a day. So weâ€™ll see.
Have a good day everyone!!stay strongðŸ’ªðŸ’ª

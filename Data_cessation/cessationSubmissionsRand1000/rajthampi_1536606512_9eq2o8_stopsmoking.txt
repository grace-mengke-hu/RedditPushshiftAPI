Well, I smoked, yet I think I am back on track

Guys I did smoke less than 15 cigarettes during my last trip to india for approximately a month time. Well, the stupidity was to prove myself that I could say NO after just one, which kept happening alternative days... Back in Kuwait now and I have already said NO to minimum 2-3 invitations to join smoking.
I have the full confidence that I can once again go 100% smoke less &amp; start feeling good about self.

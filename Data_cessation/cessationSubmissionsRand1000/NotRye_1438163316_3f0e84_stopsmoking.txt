100 Days! Woo Hoo!

I started smoking at the age of 17.  I'm 29, now.   And this is the longest I've gone without smoking.  Sure, I quit a bunch of times over the years, but those attempts were nothing more than breaks because I always went back to smoking after a few weeks or months.  

My Grandmother died of lung cancer, back in 2010.  She was a lifelong smoker, well for the last 50 years of her life.  All my life I had known her as a strong woman.  But the last year or so of her life, you don't want to know.  It was ugly.   

But having seen what I saw, it still wasn't enough.  I kept smoking cigarettes like a fool.  I couldn't stop.  I was a slave to nicotine, just like my Nanny was.  And I had pretty much resigned myself to a short life.  I thought I'd smoke until it killed me.   

But then I found you guys.  

This time, I know that I'll never smoke again.  If it weren't for /r/stopsmoking, I never would've had the support of people who'd overcome the shit that I was going through.  I never would've read Allan Carr's book.  Without both of those factors, I'd still be a smoker, and I'd still be paying through the nose for the priviledge of destroying myself.  

Thank you.  Every one of you.  Y'all have literally saved my life.  

I may not be very active on here, but just know that I love each and every one of you.  

Keep up the good work!

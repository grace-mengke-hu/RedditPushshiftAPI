32 days and I can't breathe

As a disclaimer, I have severe allergies that I'm getting injections for and Spring is tough anyways.  But my chest feels super tight, might be congested but I am coughing unproductively.  Lots of sinus symptoms.  But just can't get a deep breath.  I have not been coughing upanything, and have been surprised about that since I've smoked for 25/26 years.  

I have really been enjoying the deep breaths I've been able to take, so this is concerning me.    I'm sure it's not life threatening,  it just feels bad and makes me feel anxious.  Anyone else have this after this many days?  I'm not going to smoke again, I'm resolute,  but not sure how to ease this tightness and shortness of breath feeling. 

Edit:  I also just realized I have forgotten my iron supplements for anemia, which can cause shortness of breath.  Taking it now, hoping that's it and this isn't my new normal!

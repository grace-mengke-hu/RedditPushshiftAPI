Smoked after 24 hour streak.. no change in how I feel

I felt like crap and decided: fuck it, I'll smoke. I don't even feel different, maybe withdrawals are easier to manage than I thought after all. In a strange way it has motivated me more to stop. So if you feel like smoking to get over withdrawals, don't even bother! I only smell bad now and feel like my throat is sticky.

Just threw away all my remaining cigs. Let's do this!

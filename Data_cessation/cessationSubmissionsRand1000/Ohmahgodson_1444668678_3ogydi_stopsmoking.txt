You WILL get cravings after you think you beat it. DO NOT get discouraged!

Last week I've found myself with a few intense cravings during a particularly stressful time at work. 

The little monster was doing his best to try to convincing me that having cravings 8+ weeks after quitting was a sign that I'm not ready. I started obsessing about smoking again just like the first day quit. I found myself getting really discouraged.... but you know what happened? Nothing. The cravings passed (like the always do) and I still wasnt smoking. 

I continually reminded myself that "all of the things currently happening would STILL be happening - and be just as bad if I were smoking". Smoking doesnt reduce stress. It creates it. 

This is just a reminder to those who get a particularly nasty craving, DO NOT give in! It will pass just like all the others.

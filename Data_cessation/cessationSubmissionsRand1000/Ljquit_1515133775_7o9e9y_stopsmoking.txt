The learned addiction is very annoying and persistent.

I’m packing our caravan (I think Americans call them trailers?) for our annual 3 week holiday, and my cravings are back, out of the blue. I thought they were behind me, but here they are. I think it’s because I had a little routine all the other years - pack a bit, sit down and have a smoke while I think what else to pack, then pack a bit more then have a smoke etc. You get the idea. I think this is just part of the habit part of smoking as, after 10 months, I’m fairly sure the actual nicotine addiction has gone provided I stay off the smokes. Just thought I’d come to this sub, as I have at each struggle during my quit, both to read and respond to others posts, and to vent a little. Thanks for reading.

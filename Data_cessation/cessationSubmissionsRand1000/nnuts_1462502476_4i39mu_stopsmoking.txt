Three days nicotine free - how to proceed?

So I've been thinking about quitting for awhile - I bought an ecig for when I can't smell like smoke, but hadn't actually tried to make the switch.

Then came a few weeks ago, when I spontaneously picked up a package of NRT patches and decided I wasn't going to smoke for 'a while.'  I let myself use my ecig whenever I wanted.  I went several days without a cigarette, then stupidly bought two packs and smoked them all in a few days.  Back to the patch - another several days with only a very little bit of ecig use.  Then (sigh!) another two packs in three days.  Clearly, this is not getting me anywhere!

When those two packs were done, I didn't buy any more.  I didn't put on a patch.  I haven't used my ecig.  Right now I'm three full days without any nicotine.  Absolutely no idea how to proceed.  Exercise, for sure.  Maybe a zero-nic juice for my ecig?  

Is this time going to be any different than the others, since this time I'm nicotine free?  If I feel like I'm going to give in, should I use the patches again instead?  

Thanks all for reading - and good luck to everyone else making the leap!

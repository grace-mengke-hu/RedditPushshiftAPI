My biggest Achievement till date

So today morning i woke up and got ready for work, ate breakfast and left. While on the way it hit me. I hadn't thought about smoking all the while. Just so you know I was the guy who used to Light up directly getting outta bed. It was one the reason why i quit in the first place too.

This might be a small thing for you all. But for me it's a huge achievement, If you would have asked me 2 weeks back if would get outta my bed without a smoke, I might have asked you to fuck off.

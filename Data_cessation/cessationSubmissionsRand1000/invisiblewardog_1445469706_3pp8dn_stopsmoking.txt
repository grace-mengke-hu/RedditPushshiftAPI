Had a bad morning...but was fine

So my rear windshield [exploded this morning](https://www.reddit.com/r/Trucks/comments/3pmo00/another_f150_defrost_casualty/)...I got to work and realized this would have made me smoke four in a row, but I never even thought of it despite the small amounts of smoke coming from the window.

Checked my progress and saw that I passed the 1000 cigarettes avoided mark!  If you were to lay 1000 cigarettes end-to-end, you would have a line of cigarettes about 70 meters (about 230 feet) long.  Incredible.

As always, thanks again.  This sub has helped tremendously.

Nicotine patches and joint pain?

Hi everyone! I haven't had a smoke in 25 days, and I've been using nicotine patches to help me stop. Since I started the patches, I've had pretty intense pain and stiffness in my wrists, and to a somewhat lesser extent, my knees and ankles. Does anyone else have this issue? Thanks for all your advice, and good luck everyone!

Edit: A week later, no patches, pain is finally gone, and still not smoking!

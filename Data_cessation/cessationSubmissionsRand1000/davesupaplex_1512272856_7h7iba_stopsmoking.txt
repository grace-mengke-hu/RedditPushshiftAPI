I really wanna quit but I can't

Thing is that I'm going back home during christmas vacation, and I keep convincing myself that if I quit now I won't be enjoying my vacation, I can't really imagine myself around my friends back there and not smoking, but deep deeeeeeeeeeep down I know that quitting is the right thing to do. 

Man this addiction is really disgusting, I never saw it coming, and now I hate myself for not being able to quit. 

Every night I lay in bed my heart beating really fast lungs heavy as a rock I tell myself that it's time for me to stop, but it never really worked (except for a few times for a couples of weeks) 

It's not the first time I write here and defo not the last time. Props to everyone in here who was able to go past the addiction, and best of luck to every smoker like me who tryna quit. &lt;3

Enjoying the extra money &amp; time

I have quit 7 months ago...I have been a smoker across different countries and it was not easy to plug in my app the data on how much I used to spend in cigarettes. So I gave a very conservative estimate of that number. All the same, I already saved about 700 USD and it is really nice to get occasional treats. 
I am particularly enjoying putting more time and money into skincare. The combined effect of quitting smoking and having a more regular routine can be really rewarding. 
I'm always late for everything and busier than I'd like to be, but I have heard some people in this community saying that they miss the routines that used to go with smoking. I think skincare can totally feel that void!

Difficulty breathing feels wet, pain in stomach, presseure in lungs, lymph, snot

Quitting smoking is the easy part.  They say 3 days and nicotine is out and its all in your head.   

This is bullshit.  The pains the many pains.

Sometimes its like i cant breathe it feels wet a cough that will never come up.

I wake up every day with phlem on my throat couphing up mucus.

I eat food and try to eat healthy but my stomach and digestion is fucked.  The other day shooting pains gas crazy i couldnt sit down had to stand and move around.  Ripping huge gas all myght my girl was freaked out and slept on couch.

I cant sleep at night.  I wake up at like 5am and just stare into nothing and my eyeballs itch.

But i know all this is my body trying to temove the toxins and heal itself.

I want a oxygen tank to help with detox and breathing.  

I have been doing breathing excsrcises.   One of them is a lung cleaning excersise.

Deep breathe people its the best way.  Take 4 breaths really deep every hour of the day.  Deep like your hikding your breath under water. 


If you ever see me with a smoke in my mouth... punch me in the face!

Did you quit drinking coffee in order to quit smoking?

I've never been a coffee drinker but coincidentally as I am more successful in quitting smoking than ever, my Dad and Sister have visited and have brought coffee.  Now I'm a coffee drinker and it triggers cravings which last as long as the coffee.  After 3 years I was able to beat the alcohol and cigarette correlation. I can drink a little or at time quite a bit and hang out with smokers finally with no craving.  Can the same happen with coffee?  Good thing is I don't have access to smokes while drinking coffee.

but I love smoking......

I quit smoking 4 days ago (I'm using the patch, and I smoked 10-12 cigs a day)I wanted to quit, sort of. I like smoking. I like the feeling, I like holding it, I like inhaling/exhaling, I liked opening a new pack, flipping the lucky etc. I didn't like the smell, taste or the cost. I've been smoking since I was 14, I'm 28 now. I quit for maybe a month or two at a clip cold turkey and HATED it. I used and ecig for a few years. But I was still tethered to a nicotine addiction. God forbid I misplaced it, or the battery died, or I didn't have juice. Full blown withdrawal panic mode. I'm just trying to stay motivated. I also quit drinking a month ago too. What to do with myself with no bad vices!?! I was waiting for the 'holy cow I feel so much better'. But I don't. My lungs and my breathing feel no different. I feel like I'm in a constant state of anxiety just dying to get a puff. I'm using the patch to deal with cravings for now, and it does help. But I miss the process of smoking like hell. I just dealt with 3 sh*t customers in a row at work and I wanted to practically eat a bowl of cigarettes. I also thought I would be saving more money. I downloaded an app and it said Ill save around $1800 a year. That's it?? That is a lot of money to me up front, but over the span of a year, I really thought it'd be more. Not sure what kind of response I'm looking for. I suppose I'm just venting. Tell me its going to be ok!!

Allen Carr... Quite impressive!

I am currently reading the "EASYWAY to quit" by Allen Carr.  I have decided to take his advice and smoke until I finish the book.

If you have not read this book, please stop putting it off.  I thought it would be another convince yourself to quit - Self Help book.  So far it's not only been amazingly informative, but it's actually quite hilarious!

PLEASE check it out.  And as he says, "If you don't quit smoking after reading the book, what did you lose exactly?  Nothing.  However, if you quit after reading it, think of all you have to gain!" (Paraphrased....)

Here's a link for the PDF:

[EDIT] Personally, I think chapter 21 is the best!  If you're going to read it though, don't just jump there to see why.  It will ruin the whole idea...

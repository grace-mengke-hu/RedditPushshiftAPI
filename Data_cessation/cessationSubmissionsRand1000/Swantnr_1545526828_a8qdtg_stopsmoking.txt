Could Use Kind Words

Hey guys. I've been lurking and even actively participated in some of the threads here. Unfortunately, I'm at day 0 today and I have been for the last few months. I have tried this time and time again. I read Allen Carr's book. Ive tried vaping, gum, lozenges, and the patch. I've had the most success with the patch. It got me off smokes and I was able to complete the program but I caved again.

A bit of backstory: I'm 23 and I've only been smoking since I was 17. I frequently go to the gym. I have a very loving, caring, and attractive partner. I never graduated college but I make enough money to stay afloat and I've never been the person to buy cigarettes, booze, or weed over things like rent. Smoking has gotten to a point where I feel nothing but utter disgust. This habit is stopping me from my dream physique. Can't smoke and run, amiright? I don't have a problem in bed, but I know that if I quit, I could get even better. It is so incredibly frustrating to know that this little cancer stick has that much control. I often have conversations with myself thinking "if I can't do this one thing for myself, how will I ever achieve my other dreams?" It goes beyond just body health. I want the mental strength and willpower to quit this nasty parasitic habit. Where I live, "my brand" is about 8 dollars a pack. Multiply that by 7 and we have 56 dollars a week.

I apologize for rambling, but I'm just asking for a few kind words. I'm not sharing with my family and friends that I'm quitting. This is my battle, but a few kind words from strangers wouldn't hurt. And to anyone who has succeeded, is succeeding, or is contemplating the path to success, I'm proud of you. You can all do this.

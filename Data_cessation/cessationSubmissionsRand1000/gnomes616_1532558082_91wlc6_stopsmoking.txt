4 years!

Today (well, tonight) makes 4 years since quitting cold turkey! Even now, there are some bad days that make me want to pull my hair out, but even that is better than wasting my life in smelly alleys and stoops puffing away years of my life.

I'm less than a week to the end of my grad program, and if I hadn't quit I might not even be able to get my dream job. Many private hospital groups are moving toward not even hiring people who smoke, which while kind of an "invasion of privacy" practice, I totally understand wanting people doling out health advice and practice to be healthy themselves. They even include nicotine in the pre-employment drug screen.

For everyone in the thick of it, don't give up! It does get better, even if it feels like it won't right now!

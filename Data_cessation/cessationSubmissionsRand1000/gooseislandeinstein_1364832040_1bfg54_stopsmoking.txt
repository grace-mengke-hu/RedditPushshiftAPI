Six months quit today! Where are my stoptober quit buddies?

I am so excited to be six months quit. I struggle still, but each time i say no to a cigarette i get further away from that person i used to be. The hardest part for me was drinking and not smoking. But its just like anything else practice and will power gets through it. The easiest part was quitting while at home doing anything else. The benefits are never ending. Every time i walk up stairs and am not out of breath i think to myself i've won. I'm getting my health life back together and its awesome. I feel better than ever. If i can do it so can you! Keep on saying no.

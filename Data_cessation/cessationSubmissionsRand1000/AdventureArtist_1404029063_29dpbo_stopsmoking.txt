437 Days: I am a non-smoker, and it feels great

I imagine you there, you've made the decision to quit, I'm proud of you. This isn't your first time quitting, but you're ready this time, and you're here getting support, community, comrodery. You're smart to be here, reading this, and the other posts here. 

I know you're itching, grinding, pacing, sweating, but for real, it's all going to fade so far away. You've decided, that's it. You've quit. That's it. Get through these few days, then a week, then a month, then six. 437 days I don't even think not a single thought about smoking. Not a single fuck about the vile habit that did nothing for me and isn't even missed, not a bit.

You got this friend. Not One Puff Ever. Good riddance.

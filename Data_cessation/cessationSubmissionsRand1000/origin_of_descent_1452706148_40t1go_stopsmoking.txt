The dream has changed!

I am about two months shy of being 2 years smoke free. Sometimes I pop on to encourage others in their battle. I post less often because I just don't think about smoking often anymore. But last night something new and exciting happened. I'm sure we all have dreams in which we smoke or are tempted to. Last night was the first time in a dream (that I recall) that I announced to the offered cigarette: "I am not a smoker." I woke up smiling because of that. Keep going, champs. It gets easier!

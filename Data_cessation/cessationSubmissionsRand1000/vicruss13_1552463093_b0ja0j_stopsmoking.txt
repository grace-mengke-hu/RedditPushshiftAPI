Has anyone else?!

Thereâ€™s something Iâ€™ve been struggling with the last couple of days and at first I thought Iâ€™d just ignore it but Iâ€™m starting to think if I donâ€™t address it then itâ€™ll start causing more problems! ðŸ˜¬ 
Iâ€™m day 16 smoke free, (would have been 33 but I had a lapse and reset the clock) week 3 is always where previous attempts have gone wrong, but this time felt different, the last couple of days though Iâ€™ve kept going to light a cigarette outside before I remember that Iâ€™ve quit, it seems to happen when Iâ€™m home more than anywhere else, there isnâ€™t even any ashtrays, lighters or cigarettes in the house, itâ€™s really frustrating me especially after the first two weeks went quite well! Has anyone else suffered this an any tips for getting through?! 
Sorry for the long waffling post! ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜‚

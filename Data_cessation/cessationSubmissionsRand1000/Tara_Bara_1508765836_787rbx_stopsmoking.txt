I need a new vice!

So I quit smoking, and am seriously thinking of quitting drinking too (I have a hunch I have a problem with alcohol). I'm working out and eating healthy, and to be honest, I'm boring myself to tears, lol.

Why do I feel the need to have a bad habit? It's almost like being perfectly healthy is too dull to be worth it. Maybe that's why I smoked for so long...at least it was KINDA rebellious! Am I the only one who feels this way?

Anyhoo, what do you all recommend for a bad habit that doesn't involve slowly killing one's self?

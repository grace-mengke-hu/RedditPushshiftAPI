Patches Step Down - What can I expect?

Wednesday this week is my first patch step-down. I started on Step 2 (wasn't a heavy smoker, Dr recommended Step 2 to start), I've been at 14 mg for 6 weeks. I'm scheduled to step down to 7 mg on Wednesday for 2 weeks, then done. I have lozenges as needed. 

For anyone who's quit using patches: what can I expect on Wednesday and the days following? Will the rage and cravings and mind games start again? I've gotten to the point now where I'm not thinking about cigarettes every day, maybe once a week, and I need to know how much steeling myself I need to do.

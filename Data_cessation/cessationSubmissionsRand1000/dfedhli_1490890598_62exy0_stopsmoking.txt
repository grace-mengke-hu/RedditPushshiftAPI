Resetting my badge again

Shit. I relapsed again for a few weeks. Smoking lowers the levels of my anxiety meds in the blood. So when I smoke I feel more anxious and stressed, and then I smoke more to compensate. It's a real vicious cycle with me. I'm confident I've got it this time though. I was clean for about 3 months at one point. Wish me luck.

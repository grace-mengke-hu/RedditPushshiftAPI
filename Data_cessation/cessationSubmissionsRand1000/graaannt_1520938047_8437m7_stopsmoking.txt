How do you deal with cravings?

Just wondering if people have their own unique ways of dealing with cravings that they’d be willing to share on this thread? Had a really bad one for the past hour or so and I’m pretty sure if I drink anymore water I’m going to drown myself from the inside out. Any help would be super appreciated! :)

Let me just smoke real quick before we leave.

That’s what I said this morning as I was racing around and after I said it my daughter said, “Mom” and I stopped what I was doing and was like where did that come from??  I wasn’t even thinking about having a cigarette at that moment.  

I have been smoke free for about 8.5 months.  

I suppose this morning was a nice reminder I don’t need to race around and squeeze in that last smoke before I head out the door.

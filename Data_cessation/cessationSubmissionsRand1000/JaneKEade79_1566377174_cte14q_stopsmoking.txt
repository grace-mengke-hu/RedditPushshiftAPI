4 Days Smoke Free = 100 hours

4 days without smoking and I'm feeling amazing. My heart is full of pride. I'm so so proud of myself.  I feel so much healthier and have more energy. I feel free. I can smell and taste everything although sometimes that isn't a good thing lol ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤¢ğŸ¤¢ğŸ¤¢ğŸš¾ğŸš¾ğŸš¾â˜£â˜£â˜£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£ğŸ¤£.  The benefits of not smoking by far outweigh the benefits of smoking. All you get from smoking is no money, bad cough, stinking of smoke, horrible looking skin and teeth, bad breath, yellow fingers, a cold from having to go outside to smoke, stress, no energy, less time for other things and an early death. All of this is what keeps me determined to beat this and become a non-smoker for good

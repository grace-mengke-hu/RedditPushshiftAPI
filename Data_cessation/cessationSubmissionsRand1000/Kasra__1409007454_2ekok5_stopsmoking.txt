Day 35 - if I can do it, you can do it

Hey all, just wanted to post to say thank you...without this subreddit I definitely wouldn't have been able to quit. I've been through a really rough patch with my depression and could easily have resorted to smoking, but coming here and reading your posts has kept me smoke free. Thank you a million times.


Too any one reading this who is thinking about quitting or in the beginnings of quitting...you can totally do this.


Now for 35 more days...

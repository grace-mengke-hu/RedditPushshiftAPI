Four Days

Smoked a pack a day for 14 years. Quit cold turkey. Hasn't been easy. Days one through three I hibernated, spoiled myself binge watching TV, coconut popsicles and frequent naps. I forced myself to run. I cried, a lot. I've been irritable, moody, emotional and just a complete mess.
Today I went out and ran errands, faced the dreaded car ride without smoking. It was fine. I brought a coffee and went about my business. You know what's amazing? I can smell everything. Wet salty air, perfume on people yards away, my disgusting ashy car. It's the first positive physical change I've noticed, and I'm so excited and inspired by it. 
Here's to another day!

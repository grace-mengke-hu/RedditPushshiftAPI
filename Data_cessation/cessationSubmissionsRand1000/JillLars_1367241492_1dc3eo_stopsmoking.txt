Starting Day 3, back to work.

I'm on day 3 of my quit.  The weekend went alright because I was outside enjoying the beautiful weather and had plenty of things to keep me busy.  Today I am back to work.  I work with a lot of smokers (including some "quitters" who liked to bum smokes from me.)  I have an extremely stressful week coming up and I'm nervous about maintaining my progress.  I stocked up on gum and I'm working on my deep breathing.  Any other suggestions to deal with stress at work without puffin on a cig?

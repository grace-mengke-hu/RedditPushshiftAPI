Brain fog...

I totally missed half if my art history class because I thought it started an hour later than it really did. Sigh. This idle time is killing me. I know I there are things to do. I'm currently in a losing battle with myself regarding curling up into a ball. I didn't sleep well last night and my anxiety/depression is overwhelming. 

But I'm sticking to my plan. Just focusing on today, if I smoke that's okay as long as I try again. Even if it's a week later. I don't care how many day ones I have to have I'm doin this.

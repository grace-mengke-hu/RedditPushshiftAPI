Mind Games

This is the HARDEST thing I have ever tried to do. I feel like I am going crazy. My mind is working against me, as if it is it's own person. I have been thinking really depressing thoughts/frustrating thoughts out of the blue, and then find myself thinking "well, I guess I should just go buy some cigarettes because I can't deal with these thoughts." I know it is just happening because of the addiction, but this is worse than a craving. It's literally making me miserable and it is almost unbearable.

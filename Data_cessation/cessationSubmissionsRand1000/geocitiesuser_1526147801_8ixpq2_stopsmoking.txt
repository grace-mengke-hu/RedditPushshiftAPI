A little over a month. Two packs a day to cold turkey.

Doing really well. No coughing, no more insomnia. I'm pretty sure most or all withdrawal symptoms are gone.

I'm finally back to a place in my life where I don't think I can blame my shit attitude on cigarettes or withdrawal lol :)

Chin up everyone! 

It's really only the first couple of weeks that are bad.

I think I have the worst part behind me.

Even though, I'm just 7 days in I got pretty drunk yesterday evening with my smoking friends, and there wasn't even the slightest hint of a craving the whole time, I'm really proud of myself right now, even if it doesn't sound like a great accomplishment. Thanks to all of you guys!

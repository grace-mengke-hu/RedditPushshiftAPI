What was the biggest benefit for you of quitting smoking?

For me personally it is the mental clarity or energy I am experiencing. 

For the first month or so I suffered from terrible brain fog. Even simple tasks, such as locking the two doors to my house when going out, became difficult. Then once that cleared up I could focus so much better at work and be more productive. I am giving the credit to quitting smoking. I still vape, with nicotine, but still the mental clarity I experience now i much better than when I was smoking.

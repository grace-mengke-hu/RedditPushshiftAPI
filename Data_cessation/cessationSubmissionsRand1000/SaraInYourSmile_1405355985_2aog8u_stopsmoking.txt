One week, and I couldn't be happier!

Today marks 7 days of non-smoking for me, or as I keep reminding myself, the longest I've ever gone without a cigarette since I started smoking (7 years ago).  I can't believe the joy quitting has brought to my life.  I was despondent at Day 3, but Day 4 was better, and Day 5 was better than that, and at Day 7, I'm feeling like a million bucks!

I have an incredible sense of self-worth and self-pride.  I stayed away from alcohol this weekend as well, and really didn't even feel the desire to drink or smoke.  Next weekend I will be going out to have a beer or two, because I know I can't just avoid being social forever, but I'm feeling confident in my ability to stay strong, and keep reminding myself of the terrible feeling of Day 3, and the wonderful feeling today :)

Thank you so much for all of the supportive comments I've received on my posts.  I'm trying as much as possible to spread that positivity to others who are struggling, and hope we can all continue to share our struggles as well as our triumphs! 

For any of you reading this who are just starting out, and struggling with whether it's worth it...it is, it totally is.  Stay strong, and remember there are others out there feeling the same way.  You can overcome the addiction, and freedom is worth every bit of sweat and tears you may shed!

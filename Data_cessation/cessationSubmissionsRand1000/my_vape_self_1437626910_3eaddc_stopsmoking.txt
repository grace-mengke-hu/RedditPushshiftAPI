You can you use your votes to help people quit smoking.

[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/3e9pxq/relatively_light_smoker_can_i_continue_smoking_at/) was downvoted to zero when I saw it.  

It is not the most artful question:  "Can I continue smoking at the rate that I do without significant health risks?"  But we get a lot of people who wander in.  They thought "I want to quit smoking."  They searched, and here they are in our front foyer.

If you see these posts, please upvote them not because you think it is a good question.  Rather upvote them because you are glad they are here.

p.s. the replies to the post were nice.

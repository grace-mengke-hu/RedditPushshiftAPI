4 Months Smoke-Free, over $1,000 saved, and almost 2,500 cigs NOT smoked! Wow!!!

For all those just starting, keep one foot in front of the other. Make it your goal to get to tomorrow. Soon, the days are easier and now I am rarely thinking about smoking. It does get easier although I will honestly say I didn't fully believe that at first!   Keep strong!!!!

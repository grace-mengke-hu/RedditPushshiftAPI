Quitting is quite enjoyable sometimes :)

Some things that have helped:
1. walk.
2. deep breaths.
3. the knowledge that cigs do nothing.
4. talking to people.
5. easy situations.
6. the joy of being a non smoker.
7. the money saved and the splurging I have done. a nice Bluetooth speakers for the morning. an expensive phone cover for the day. also about to arrive, a noise cancelling headphone to make up for the quiet time during smoke breaks. 
8. to be really honest, I have only had one really overpowering craving and my friend refused to let me borrow his cigarette. so yea, friends have worked.

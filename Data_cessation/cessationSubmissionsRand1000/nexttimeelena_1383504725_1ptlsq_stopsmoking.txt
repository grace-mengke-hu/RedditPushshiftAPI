I convinced myself that I don't want to quit.

Well, as the title says. Tomorrow it will be 8 days without a cig, that is the most I have ever got, and I don't even feel that I need them, just scumbag toughts as I recall: why am I even quiting? i don't want to smoke, it is unhealthy, i have nicotine stains, awful caugh and terrible headaches. I don't even enjoy cigs, only the first maybe second smoke. I don't have money. Yeah, but lets smoke, I mean think about the sitting on the bench, it is cold outside and you just sit and smoke. You need a cig. You want a cig. You can't quit them. The guy you like smokes, your friends smoke, everyone smokes, go buy a pack tomorrow in the morning.

I am a bit crazy but yeah, this is conversation with myself so please help me please!

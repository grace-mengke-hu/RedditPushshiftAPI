I bought a pack

Today is four months im smoke free, i had huge urge to buy a pack, i had Long self talk with myself before i bought it. Well it happened, i bought for satisfaction, i did it. 

In work i went outside, took a cigarette, stood there 10 minutes not lighting it, having self talk all the time. There hours passed, i went outside with cigarette again, stood there for another 10 minutes... 

After work i went home, but before that i sat on a bench in the park, again playing with a cigarette. I just couldnt Light it up, i couldnt do it. If ill do it i will lose all self respect, i will be a hypocrite... But still, they are in my mind.

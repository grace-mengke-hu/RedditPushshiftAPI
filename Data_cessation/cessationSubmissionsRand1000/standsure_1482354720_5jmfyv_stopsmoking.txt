1500

Quitting cold turkey is the best thing I ever did.  Just over four years ago Australia introduced plain package it for cigarettes and as I watched the vendor searching for the least offensive picture, I knew it was time. 

I was about two months sober (long story for another sub) and was more than willing to quit. 

I'd reached a point where I'd have to fight back the dry retching to finish a smoke. My body would try to vomit if I smoked  too quickly and I had to smoke quickly. 

The glamour had long gone. 

So I put them down a cigarette at a time. Making it a game helped. Look at the geographical  freedom being smoke free gives me.  

I can walk anywhere I want, I get my breaks back at work. 

I've saved about $10,000 (calculated at the $14 a packet when I quit - the price is around $25-30 these days)

I started smoking at 14 and made four or five serious quit attempts. 
I didn't quit after reading the Alan Carr book the first time I read it. 

But I never quit quitting. Each time I got better at it. 

I promise if I can quit, you sure as shit can. 

Peace.

Forgot to put my patch on this morning. Don't feel a difference or have any cravings. Should I quit the patch it keep going? 8 days smoke free

Hi guys. I'm on 2nd week of a 26 week NRT program through my local hospital. It's going great and I do nt really have any cravings. Smelly farts are the biggest side effect right now, lol.

Anyway like the headline says, I forgot the patch this morning and I don't feel a difference. What to do? Should I keep going on the patch for a few more weeks at least or should I use this opportunity to quit nicotine all together?

I know we're all difference but I was hoping someone would share their experience with me :)

Day 5: A huge career path is closed for me today

I've entered a psychometrics exam (in another city) for changing my career path to something very well paying kind of guaranteed path. However I've failed it with 2 tiny mistakes. I'm very stressed and I have 6 hours until my flight back home. The fucker is calling me, but I know it won't help anything. I don't want to smoke.

The beginning of a new life

I just smoked my last cigarette. I previously quit for over a year. When I decided to quit my job to focus on school, I became stressed and stupidly smoked a cigarette. That’s all it took. One smoke. I was hooked again. Well, after smoking for about two months straight, I decided to quit again. I want my health back. I’ve found I’ve spiraled out of control with my health since that first smoke. It’s time for a change. I can do it, I know I can.

Positive Affirmations

I wish there was an app for my phone that notifies me messages from Alan Carr's book every hour or so. I feel really good after reading it and feel I can stop, then I forget a lot of the teachings and decide I need to smoke. Is there any kind of stop smoking apps out there like this?

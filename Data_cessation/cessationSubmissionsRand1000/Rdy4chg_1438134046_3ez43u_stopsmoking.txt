Bad craving

My buddy and I live together. I quit nicotine almost three days ago. I haven't been around cigarettes since then. I caught a wiff of one at work yesterday but it was only walking by. Like 5 minutes ago my room mate lit up in front of me cause he's having a bad day. I had a hard time concentrating on what he was talking about and my heart rate was erratic and I couldn't sit still. The smoke smells pretty bad and it made me cough too. I resisted having one though. Thought I'd share

Facing my demons again.

In January I quit smoking. It wen't great. There were tough times for sure, but I was motivated. It lasted until 1 April, when my wife had a miscarriage. I fell off the wagon big time.

What followed was months of being shitty. Smoking, drinking, stopped exercising. Just generally being shit. 

Wife got pregnant again 3 months ago, and I had all the good intentions of quitting, getting back to being great - but ultimately didn't

Today I am pulling myself together. 

I had my last cigarette this morning at 06:00, and only because it was the last one in my pack. I built myself a little quit app over the weekend to help me log my cravings and give me some goals to aim for (it tells me I quit 3 hours ago!). I hate smoking. I hate being overweight and out of breath all the time. I hate the idea of being a shitty father that can't fight the fight to be a better person. It's time to get better.

The next few days are going to suck, but I am treating it like I'm just a bit sick. The symptoms will go away, I just need to look after myself.

I wen't for a run this morning when I got to the office, and I feel pretty good. I can feel the pressure in my chest building up to want a smoke, but I think I can fight it today.

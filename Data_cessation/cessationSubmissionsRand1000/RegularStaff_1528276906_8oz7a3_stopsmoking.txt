on my way again

had to reset my counter at the weekend, but feels good to have my badge moving in the right direction again

Only 5 cigs in 33 days but I felt it was enough to reset my badge. 

Havent smoked since sunday am, so really is 72 hours, but I wanted to start my badge on a day when I hadnt smoked at all.

Good luck all, wont smoke with you today.

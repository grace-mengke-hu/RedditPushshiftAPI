Black stuff in my phlegm

I guess it's a normal part of quitting but can I take something to help speed the process up? Musinex? Hot water vapor? Rhino horn? Shove a coat hanger down my airway and wiggle it around a little. My lungs hurt I'll try anything. 

Ignore my badge. I quit 4 days ago this time for good I just can't figure out the auto badge bot. 



Not one more drag no matter what.

I used LSD to help me quit

My last cigarette was last Thursday. Friday I took a half of a dose of LSD. I still had a ton of cravings for nicotine! However i felt as if I was able to objectively deal with the cravings better. Plus I was in a better mood and was able to laugh at the cravings! On day three I still had cravings, but they were more like an annoying mosquito bite to be ignored. 

I've been smoking for 12 years. I have seriously quit somewhere between 10-20 times. The longest I have refrained from tobacco is 3 months.

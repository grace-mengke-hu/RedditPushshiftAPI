On day 10 and spending some time in this subreddit and you guys have me worried!

My day 1 wall of text submitted here was a short story of sobbing and frustrations I was feeling that particular day. Okay, nothing wrong with that, there's a lot of that for everybody's first day.

I'm now on my 10th day! (haven't gone this far before EVAR!! :D)

BUUUUUT

I'm seeing all of these posts of people on their 20th, 30th, 50th, etc.. day and they've slipped up and smoked! I'm pretty worried that that's going to be me. I've been avoiding going out to the bars and things like that with my friends because it's still early in my quitting and I don't feel that I'm even close to being "out of the woods"

Eventually, I'm going to have to go out with my friends on the weekends again. I can't just avoid the people in my life because i'm trying to quit smoking! I just hope that I have the strength to be able to remind myself that I don't smoke anymore. It'd be even better if by that time I am so over cigs that I don't even want one at all. I won't know till I know, I guess.

How long was it before you really felt like you were straight up a nonsmoker and just about nothing would make you want a cigarette? Because so far, 9 full days hasn't been long enough at all. (not that I thought it would be btw)


Either way, 10th DAY TODAY! WOOOOOO

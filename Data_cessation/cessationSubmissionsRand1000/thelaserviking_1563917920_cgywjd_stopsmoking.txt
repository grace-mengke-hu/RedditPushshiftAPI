Day 198. Today I bought a new car.

When I started my quit journey over six months ago, one of my goals was to use the money saved to help purchase a new car. In that 6 months I saved about $2000. Without that money I wouldâ€™ve easily fallen short of getting the car I set out to buy. 

Today is a good day.

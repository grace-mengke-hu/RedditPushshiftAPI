Good news

Made it through day one and only about 5 hours left of day 2. Someone told me at work today that my attitude is too happy this morning. Maybe it's cause I got good sleep last night from no nicotine in my system and/or its because I'm proud I've made it this far. Whatever it is, it's nice to hear from someone that changes are happening because of my choice of freedom from being an addict. Still a struggle every day since it's only day two but it can only get easier and better!!

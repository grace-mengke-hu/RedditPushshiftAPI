Day 6

Today I’m happy!!!

I am so proud of myself for choosing health. I’m excited for all the good things that are happening now and that I know will continue to evolve positively the farther my quit date resides in the rear view. 

I’m more kind to myself.  I’m more aware of myself relative to others. I have more confidence.

Past experience tells me this is a dangerous time, as I have often relapsed when I cross this threshold and put my guard down. Not this time.

This time I am on the attack. Now I am ready. I will not falter.  I will not back down. I will not waiver.  I’m committed to myself.  I choose health.

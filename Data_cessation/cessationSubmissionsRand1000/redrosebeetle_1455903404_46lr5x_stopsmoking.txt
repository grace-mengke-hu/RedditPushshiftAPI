Am I the only one who comes to this forum just to look at my badge?

Yeah, I know it's only been 5 days for me, but, I like to come here and look at my badge and think, "If I smoked today, I'd have to reset my badge..... Look, five pretty little smoke-free days."  Today is also my first day without nicotine (I think the patches were just prolonging my misery), so wish me luck.

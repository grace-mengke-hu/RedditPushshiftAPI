What is the easiest way you've tried to stop smoking?

No one in my family smokes but my aunt who I see not so frequently. I want to quit but I live with 3 other people and we all smoke. My boyfriend and I even smoke in our room. I work in a place where people reside and my boss smokes and 7 out of the 10 residents smoke. I'm surrounded by it.

I want to quit but am unsure where to even begin. I went three days without smoking when I got my wisdom teeth out, wanted to try to quit then but was craving them too much. I even tried to cut it down but found myself day after day increasing to my normal amount.

It's habit that when I get in my car, I light a cigarette. And if I'm stuck in traffic on my way to work and still have ten minutes til I get there I light another.

I've always thought of trying the patch, but how has that worked for you? What else would you suggest? At this point in my life, it's more that I want to save money than anything else.

Back again after falling off the wagon for a few months.

Well, at the end of last year and the beginning of this year, I quit for a couple of months. Then life, work, relationships, blah blah blah stress excuses and all that jazz.

Today I quit. I went back to the gym this morning and I enlisted one of my buds that's a coworker to help coach me in making healthy gym habits and keeping me accountable for smoking. He is actually a certified trainer so, I'll be lean and mean by the end of the year.

Time to breathe easy and drink lots of water. At 26,I've been a smoker for about 8 years. I can't believe I've been killing myself this long...

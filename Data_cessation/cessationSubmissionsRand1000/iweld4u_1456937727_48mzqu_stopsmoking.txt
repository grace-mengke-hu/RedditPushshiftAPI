Numb/Furry tongue

My mouth and tongue have felt funny since the day I quit. Was wondering if anyone else had this problem. Tip of tongue and back of throat feel numb, was coughing up some horrid bitter tasting phlegm for awhile. Was at the doctor over the weekend and she gave me pills for chronic bronchitis. Sorry about the gross stuff, but was wondering if anyone else had this or if it is all the bronchitis? Sad thing is I have been smoke free for just about a month but have not felt good for even one day.

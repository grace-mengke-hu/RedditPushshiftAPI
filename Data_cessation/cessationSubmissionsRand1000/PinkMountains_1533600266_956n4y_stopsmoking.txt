Unpopular Opinion: Quit Drinking at first

Ok ok maybe you can handle it, but if you are anything like me and smoking and drinking go hand and hand, hear me out! 

I decided to quit drinking and smoking at the same time. I have quit tons of times before this, and it has made it so much easier I’m actually mad at myself for not figuring it out sooner. I was so desperate to hold on to drinking (another problem for another sub) that I was ruining my chances of quitting smoking. 

4 days into quitting smoking, I had one drink. Literally from the moment I had my first sip to the time the effects wore off, I was thinking about smoking. The lizard brain had taken right over. 

In other news, I’m so excited to get to one month!

TL;DR: I’m at day 23 and quitting drinking at the same time made quitting smoking 100x easier.

Got my 1-month star and my SO followed my lead. Now I post bad sailing metaphors for you!

I spent 20+ years waiting for the _right time_ to finally quit smoking for good. I've had a few good runs along the way... the longest quit attempt lasting about 6 months. For the past few years, I've been married to a smoker: always wanting to quit, but waiting for her to be ready to quit with me (we smoked the same brand, so there were always _my_ cigarettes around the house). One day I just decided that I needed to stop waiting for the _right time_ and embark on the journey. I realized that we were just enabling each others' addiction.

It turns out that I was waiting for her to commit to quitting while she was waiting for me commit to quitting. Now we're both smoke-free for at least a few weeks. I'm counting my days and she has had a few slips along the way, but I'm not keeping count for her (that's her personal journey). It's been pretty incredible to commit to charting the non-smoking waters and steering the ship - come hell or high water. 

As of today, I'm as committed as ever to sailing ahead. My wife is following me out to sea but she doesn't have the /r/StopSmoking armada to back her up. But I do, and I know that there are others who are navigating the same murky waters. I want to be a guiding star anyone who is looking for one... just for this first month of quitting... so that you know that this adventure is as worthwhile as it is challenging. 

Don't wait for someone else to take the helm for you. Take the wheel and steer beyond your comfort zone. There will be waves and high water, but you are the captain of your own ship... and I'm about out of sailing metaphors. Take the helm and go watch _Pirates of the Caribbean_ if you want some more weird sailing inspiration... just don't smoke today!

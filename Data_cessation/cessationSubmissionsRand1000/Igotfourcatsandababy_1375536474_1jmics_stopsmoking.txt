Have to stay strong!

I play music at our state fair just about every night for the next two weeks. Booze, girls, and CIGARETTES. Fucking everywhere. So close to breaking down last night, and I couldn't remember how many days I had accumulated. I actually thought to myself, "When I get to 60 days I will celebrate with one. Just one."

The fuck if I am.

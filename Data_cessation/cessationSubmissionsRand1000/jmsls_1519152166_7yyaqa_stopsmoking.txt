10 days without smoking, of course I need to get the worst flu I've ever had.

It was going so well, starting healthy habits and studying. On friday I went to the gym friday with minimal withdrawal symptoms, it was the second time in ages I exercised. I went on to use a machine after a guy had just finished and moments later I see that same man coughing like his life depended on it and having a runny nose, which filled me with rage. How the fuck dare this person make me sick whilst I'm already struggling with quitting smoking, weed, alcohol and all other drugs?

It's now monday and of course I'm really sick, unable to do anything productive really. My coughing hurts a lot, I hope I don't get bronchitis afterwards. I was finally so excited to be improving myself, I know it's not a rational thought but I just don't feel that same motivation and inspiration anymore. I was hoping to keep that ball rolling. Hopefully, when this sickness is over I can easily get started again because it already took me so much effort to even get started.

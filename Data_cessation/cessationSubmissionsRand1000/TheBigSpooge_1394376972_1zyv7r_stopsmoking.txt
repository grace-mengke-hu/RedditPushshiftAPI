goddamnit i want a cigarette

how do you deal with depression and wanting to kill everyone, including yourself, when quitting?

Update:  I feel like I'm going to throw up, my head hurts, and I have tons of work to do before tomorrow.  Should I push through and hope I recover enough to get some work done, or should I knock myself out with a couple Ambien and try to get it done in the very early morning?

I haven't forgotten about you r/stopsmoking

Excited to say that this is the first time I have came to this r/stopsmoking subreddit in over a week :) That doesn't mean to me that I have forgotten it just means that I am not thinking about smoking nearly as often as I was. When I first quit I was in the subreddit a TON! It helped me tremendously to read that other people were in the same boat as me. So happy to say that this has gone much easier than I had thought it would be. Thank you all for your support! And to the ones on the first week... it WILL get easier. I promise don't give up! 

SEE my little icon is a star now who knew!

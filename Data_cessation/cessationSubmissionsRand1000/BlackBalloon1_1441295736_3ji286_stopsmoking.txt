"If you're tired of starting over, stop giving up"

I found an interesting clip of a TED Talk, but this quote stood out to me.

This past week has been a real struggle, but sometimes it gets easier for a few hours. It's good to have those short breaks. I don't want to start over again, I am tired of it and I hope I don't have to.

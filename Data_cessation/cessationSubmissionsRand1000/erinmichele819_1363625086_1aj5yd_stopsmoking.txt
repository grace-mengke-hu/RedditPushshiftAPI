I have the book, I have the date. What is next?

For those of you that used Allen Carr's book to quit, how did you do it? Did you read a little each day or all at once? Did you smoke while you were reading or stop before you started the book? Did you use patches, gum etc? 

My date is actually tomorrow so I'd love your feedback. 
Thanks!!

I’m Scared

    So I was able to quit for a significant amount of time, felt good, felt free, honestly felt like I was out of the nicotine trap.   Because of this naïveté and false sense of security, I started having the occasional cigarette here and there, they initially tasted disgusting but I kept smoking them to get that romanticized “buzz”.   Here am months later, a pack or so every few days, where I have “fallen in love” with cigarettes all over again; that imagined sense of peace and need for smokes is back in full-force and I’m an addict yet again.

    With it being April 1st and the first month of warm weather and springtime, I figured now is as a good time to quit as ever so I can be free and back on track come summer.   I know if I don’t do it now, I never will.  I’ve also reached the point financially that I can no longer afford to smoke, but with a personality that’s already inherently anxious and neurotic, I hate to give “the idea” of my only coping skill and emotional crutch.   With so many relapses in the past and the horrors of withdrawal fresh in my mind, I’m absolutely terrified of giving quitting another go.  Thanks for listening.

A Little Thing: Morning Routine

I used to get up, smoke, eat breakfast, smoke, shower, and then smoke.  Literally every step of my process was punctuated with a cig.  That means I'd smoke 3-4+ times before even leaving my house for work.  It was a lot.

A side effect of smoking so much while getting ready (which I now realize I did mostly did out of sheer procrastination/anxiety) is that I spent a lot of time smoking.  When I quit, I notice that suddenly I'm ready to go 15-25 minutes sooner.  I have this pocket of time for myself.  I'm not worried about being late.  My mornings, although sometimes riddled with cravings, are overall much more peaceful and productive.

I'm grateful how quitting smoking changed my morning routine.

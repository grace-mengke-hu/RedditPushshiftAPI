So glad to be free of it. I didn't realise how it dictated my actions and life.

Last weekend my husband and I spent the night in the city (about 3 hours from where we live) to see a show. It was so good to be able to book a nice room and not worry whether it had a balcony, or having to catch the lift down to stand outside to smoke. On the way home we went to a huge shopping mall where we bought lots of clothes etc and saw a movie. Spent about 5 hours there, and we didn't have to find an exit to go outside to smoke. Also, all of this was financed with our 'not smoking' money. I've been putting it aside since we quit. It's just so nice to be able to focus on enjoying the show, or movie or whatever and not be thinking "How much longer until intermission so I can smoke". The cravings are pretty much gone completely now, only the occasional thought pops up, but is easily ignored til it passes. So glad we quit after nearly 40 years smoking. Why didn't we quit sooner?!

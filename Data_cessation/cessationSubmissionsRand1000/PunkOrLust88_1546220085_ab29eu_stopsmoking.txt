Here I Go Again...

Made a resolution to quit smoking when I turned 30 on January 28 of this year.  Well, it is now December 30 and I am still a smoker after spending the last three months starting and stopping quits every other day.  Made it a month, but blew it, so here I am trying to stop smoking yet again.   I may not have quit when I turned 30, but if I can stay strong tomorrow, I can at least leave 2018 behind as a new non-smoker.   This one has to stick because I just canâ€™t take the back and forth flip-flopping of smoking and quitting and then smoking and quitting again, I need to break the cycle once and for all.

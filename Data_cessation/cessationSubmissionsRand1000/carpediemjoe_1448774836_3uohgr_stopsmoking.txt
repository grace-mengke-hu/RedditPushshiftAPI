Longing for the 50s

I heard about this sub through the Smoke Free app. First timer to Reddit.

I need your guys help. I am in love with the 50s. Dressing up. Drinking and smoking at work. Etc

I got married a month ago and we have a honeymoon baby on the way so I want to quit smoking for my wife and child.

The problem is I feel like quitting smoking is giving into the lameness of modern life. "Don't drink. Don't smoke. Don't eat red meat. Don't eat carbs" blah blah blah, basically eat lettuce and be boring all day.

No smoker thinks it is good for their health. BUT is quitting smoking just another way we live less to live longer? Carr says the life of a non smoker is way more enjoyable than a smoker. I think that's true in 2015 since smoking is banned everywhere (who wants to stand out in ten degree weather). 

I just need your help guys. I'm desperate. I haven't smoked for two weeks. Have been using snus so I don't flip out. I'm a believer in Carr that I should just cut off the nicotine. But I don't want to give in to modernity. I have been drinking heavily after work now to cope with the cravings. I watch Mad Men and 50s movies all the time now so I get to watch people smoke since I can't. 

Do any of you struggle with longing for the 50s? Have you found a way forward? I pretty much want to cry all day since I quit smoking. 

With a heavy heart.

I want to escape this shitty evil slavery...

Please don't think I'm weak...I've smoked pretty much my entire life (started at 12 and since 18 I've been a heavy smoker. I'm 38 now.

In the last year my health is going to shit. I can't breathe well and get a lot of pains in my chest. I don't want to die, but it's like the more stressed I feel about it, the more I've smoked.

I'm downloading Allen carr again, didn't work for me before but I'm going to give it another go. I don't want to get into ecigs cos they just make me feel sick and NRT is just keeping myself hooked. I'm going to quit on boxing day. I have one pack of cigs left and when they are gone. That's it. I'm not buying any more of these evil shitty things.

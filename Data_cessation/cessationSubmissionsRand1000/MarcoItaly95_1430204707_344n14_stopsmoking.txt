Again me

Day 9.
I am positively shocked (don't know how to say it in other ways, I'm Italian) by myself: I am standing against smoke and in strong cravings, for now, my discipline is very strong.
There are a lot of situations where I can just ask for a cigarette, but I find myself stopped by the "soldier" part of me and I feel very happy.
But I still suffer of strong cravings, sometimes. For example just now I thought about having one, even if my home is empty. And I felt a great desire.
It looks like that I haven't realized yet that I will not smoke anymore in my life. Even in 60 years' time (I am 20).

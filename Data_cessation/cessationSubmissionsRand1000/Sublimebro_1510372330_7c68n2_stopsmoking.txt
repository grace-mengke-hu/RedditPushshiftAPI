I’m running a 10 mile race next Saturday

Hey guys! I hardly ever post here anymore as it’s been 3 and a half years since I quit. I still think about how much this community helped me when I was here. I actually wasn’t sure if I wanted to make this post. I don’t consider myself an ex smoker anymore, but just a non smoker. I decided to give an update anyway and hope this post helps inspire others. 

I just wanted to check in and tell you guys that I’m running a 10 mile race next Saturday and I expect to run about 8:30-ish miles. In January I’ll be running my first half marathon. 

Since I’ve quit I’ve been through so many different adventures with health and fitness and 2017 has been dedicated to running! Wishing you all the best of luck.  If I can do this, so can all of you! The amount of different doors that will open up for you once you quit smoking will be incredible. You’ll be amazed at where your life ends up on this journey. 

Also I just want to mention that after 3 years I don’t remember the last time I got a real craving. You know, one that makes you want to get a cigarette and you have to fight yourself to not get one. When people tell you that the cravings never go away, understand that sometimes what they’re referring to is just a minor urge or a nostalgic feeling. Not the cravings that you’re experiencing the first month. Not the mental battle you have with yourself to drive to the gas station and buy a pack. I tell you this because hearing that the cravings never go away was always so frustrating to me. But after a few years of not smoking, I assure you the cravings do go away.

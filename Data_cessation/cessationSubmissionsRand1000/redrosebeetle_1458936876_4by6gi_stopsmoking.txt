I Know I'm a Non-Smoker Now!

I just got back from a trip to see family.  I had every possible smoking trigger thrown at me over the course of five days, and I won!  

Here are some triggers I faced:  

* 2 8 hour long drives
* My family
* Random strangers who want to fuck with me (long story)
* Being in a casino
* My family
* My family
* Did I mention my family?  I think I might have missed mentioning that once or twice.  :-P  
* Alcohol (on a related note, I may have drank a tiny bit more than I wanted to, but, overall, I feel pretty good about staying in my comfort zone there, too, and not letting my family pressure me into drinking more or drinking more to cope with family).  

Overall, it was a lovely trip (please don't let the above list make you think it wasn't).  I'm finding new ways to deal with my family in a constructive manner instead of passive aggressively smoking cigarettes the entire vacation.  

Also, when I got home, a shipment of perfume samplers I ordered from Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab had arrived!  I ordered them as a reward for not smoking and figured since I can smell them now, it's worth their higher prices.  Loooooooooooooove the smell Arkham.  It's awesome.  

And happy 40 days to me!

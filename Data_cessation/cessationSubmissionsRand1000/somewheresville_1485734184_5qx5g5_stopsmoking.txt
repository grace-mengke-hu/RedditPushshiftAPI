4 years + a couple days

Hey everyone, just popped by to brag and to offer encouragement (but mostly brag). I just blew past four years without a single drag on a cigarette after 23 years as a pack a day plus smoker. It was pretty gross at first but that faded away after a month or so. Now, I only remember my quit anniversary because my phone app reminds me.

I used a combination of lots of running and lots of knitting to keep the cravings at bay. I'm currently training for my 3rd marathon and I've completed 5 sweaters and numerous pairs of socks. 

That's all. I'm pretty proud of myself and I thought I'd share.

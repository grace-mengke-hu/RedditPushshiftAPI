Still holding strong since the new year

Really wanted to check in, I realized I passed the 3 week mark and didn't even notice! 24 days in and I'm feeling so proud of myself, and I feel like if I can do this, I can tackle just about anything else! I love having this great support system and I am so thankful for each and every person on this sub who has taken the time to reach out and lend words of support and encouragement not only to me, but to everyone trying to better themselves. You guys are the real MVPs!

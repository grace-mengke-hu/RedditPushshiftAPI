12 steps and cigarettes

I am so grateful for this subreddit and all the people struggling, and it seems like even more, succeeding in giving up tobacco. I feel like I've reached a point in my unsuccessful quitting where I'm constantly on the cusp of being ready to give them up for good, gaining knowledge (Allen Carr, Freedom From Nicotine) and understanding about this addiction...but I keep relapsing. I have not had a drink in more than 5 years but I feel the cigarettes go so hand in hand and were raised in the same soil as my (former?) alcohol problem. I am wondering what kind of success people have had with Twelve Steps and cigarettes and also inviting anyone interested to read the Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions book with me here, I'm picking up my copy from the library later today. Thanks!

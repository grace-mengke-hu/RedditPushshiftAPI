Been a smoker since I was 15. I am 23 now and today is the first day of stopping!

Feeling pretty good. About 10 hours down. No major cravings as of yet. I am using a patch and the only thing is that it is itchy as hell. But still going. I am a father now and I can't think of a better reason to quit than for my baby girl.

Edit: Thanks for sharing your stories guys. I am not selfish enough to think that I'm the only one going through this. But it's still great to hear from other people.

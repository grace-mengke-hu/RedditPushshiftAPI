What if...

What if you smoke only a couple of cigs during a week. A special “me time”, where only you sit relaxed, with a cig, do some meditation, some breathing exercises. Just 2 cigs a week,  once a week and no more. I actually do not think that it will do you any harm. I think that the problem is in the amount. Of course if you smoke 10 cigs or a pack per day, you’re f.ed. I believe everything in life must have a balance. 
I am trying to quit right now, been 23 days since I quit.  Feeling wonderful. Cravings are not that bad that they were in the beginning, and it is getting easier and better. But why totally cut yourself from it? It is like having a couple of beers once a week. I don’t know. I am trying to make some research on it and find the best option possible.

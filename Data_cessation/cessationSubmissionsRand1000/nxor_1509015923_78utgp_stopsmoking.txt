Half a year!

I can't believe it! I am so happy to be rid of cigs. Going out has become much better, and I am paying a lot more attention to my health in general. Even went vegan! Everything is better. Can't wait for the end of the year to celebrate my birthday a non-smoker for the first time since 2007!

Thanks to all of you for helping.

Edit: THANK YOU SO MUCH!!! :) Your responses gave me a lump in my throat, you lovely fucking peeps!

My one week milestone

Happy anniversary to me! 
Today is my one week mark and I’m feeling pretty good. I felt it would be beneficial to document it here amongst all you supportive people. 
I started smoking when I was 16 which was 7 years ago and I was instantly hooked. I very quickly (within my first few weeks of smoking) became a pack a day smoker. 
Now I’m 23 and I became so tired of the chore of smoking and last week at 2 packs a day I said fuck it, bought a NRT device and threw away a pack and a half of smokes. 
I’ve been so happy this past week with my decision and the way my lifestyle is changing and that feeling is overwhelming any possibility of regret for not smoking anymore or any want to go back to it.
I appreciate anyone for reading this and wish you all good luck on your quitting journeys as well.

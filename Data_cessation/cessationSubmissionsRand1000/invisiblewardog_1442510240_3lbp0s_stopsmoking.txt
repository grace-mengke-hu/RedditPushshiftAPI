Melatonin?

I know many of you are cold-turkey and no other help...but I was curious if any of you have used melatonin to aid in quitting?  

I came across a research paper from this year and posted it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3lbkv6/melatonin_administration_alters_nicotine/) in /r/science.  

The full paper, if you are interested: [Melatonin administration alters nicotine preference consumption via signaling through high-affinity melatonin receptors](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-015-3886-1)

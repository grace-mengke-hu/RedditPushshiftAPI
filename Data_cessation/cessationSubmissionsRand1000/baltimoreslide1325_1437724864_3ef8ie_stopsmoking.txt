What else changed for you/did you change in your life after you stopped smoking?

I read a lot of posts from folks who say that quitting smoking triggered other positive changes in their lives--sometimes major ones. One person told me that, for them, quitting was unexpectedly a "revolution of the self." Others note that they did new things with the newfound time and health and it's adding up. What else changed for you after quitting, or what else were you able to change for yourself after quitting? (And how did quitting smoking trigger those changes, if it did?)

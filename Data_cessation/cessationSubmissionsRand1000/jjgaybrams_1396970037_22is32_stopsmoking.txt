I'm 5 days in, my head is killing me and I can't sleep, but for the first time in years I really got to enjoy the smell of a rainy day

So like I said in the title, things are going rough. My head has been throbbing since yesterday, and I have been having a terrible time sleeping. Work has been extra stressful without my little smoke breaks, but there have been perks I'm noticing.

I didn't realize how weak my sense of smell and taste had become. Food tastes better, I'm breathing a little easier, and my favorite thing so far has been smelling the spring weather in a way I haven't experienced it in over six years.

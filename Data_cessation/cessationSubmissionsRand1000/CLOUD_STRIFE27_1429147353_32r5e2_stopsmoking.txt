Quit 10 weeks ago and went for a 1 mile jog today...

and my goodness, my lungs were hurting and I had shortness of breathe for a good 10-15 minutes or so after.  In my state of exhaustion, I started Webmd-ing myself into a panic wondering what was going on with me.  COPD?!  Asthma?!  I smoked for ~9 years and I'm 27 so I'd like to think it's just my lungs getting used to things and not a long-term issue.

I thought I would have an easier time running after quitting a couple months ago.  Has anyone else had experiences like this?  Am I overreacting? Obviously, a doctors trip is in order for myself too.

EDIT: You guys are the best and most reassuring group of people on this website.  It makes me happy to know a support group like this is just a click away.  Thank you!!!

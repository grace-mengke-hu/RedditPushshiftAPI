9 months

By this time, everything is easier relating to no-smoking. I love being a non smoker, not having to stop at the news shop for a pack. I don’t go out at -7 celsius degree to inhale. I feel healthier. I’m just happy for every anniversary relating to quiting. Hope I’ll never put a ciggarette in my mouth.

Tomorrow is day one

I've had a few decent quits recently going ten days a few times and feeling really good about it when I did so. Now I'm back to quitting tomorrow morning as I've been smoking steadily and heavily for the past few weeks. I'm excited to get some days under my belt again and stop smoking for good. 

I'll be doing it one day at a time and I'll be consistent on this sub as it really helps. Everyone's posts are really great to read, thanks all

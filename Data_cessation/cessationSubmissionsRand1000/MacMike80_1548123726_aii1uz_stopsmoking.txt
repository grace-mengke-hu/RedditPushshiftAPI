Day 21.

Man alive!! Day 21 is almost done!! I can’t wait to get the three week badge!!  To think on nights like tonight, where it’s 19 degrees (I love Wisconsin), I might be at the bar w my buddies and going outside after every drink to smoke, freezing my ass off (can’t smoke in bars in Wisconsin).  Whether it was raining, snowing, freezing, hotter than hell I would be outside puffing my brains out.  Man, I feel stupid now.  All the money I spent.  What a waste- i probably could have paid for a house by now.  I had a few cravings today.  But they passed quick.  One was worse than the others because I was bored, but it too passed.   I went and did laundry tonight- there was a young couple doing laundry too and going outside to smoke- I was watching them out the window freezing.  I felt bad for them.  Can’t wait for the badge.  And ten more days till a month smoke free!!
All the people just starting out- you can do this!!!  One minute, one hour, one day at a time!!

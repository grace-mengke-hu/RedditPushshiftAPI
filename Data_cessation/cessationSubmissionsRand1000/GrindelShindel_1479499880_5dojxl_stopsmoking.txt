Quitting smoking = more energy

Today i met with two friends. Both are smoking. I thought i would struggle not to smoke. But it was fine. And apparently I had a lot more fun compared to when i used to smoke and hang out with them.
We laughed a lot and i had so much more energy to keep the conversations nice and vivid.
I also noticed that when i used to smoke i always had this subtle feeling of regret. This really can push you down and take away your energy.
So long story short: Face situations in which you used to smoke and you will see you are going much better now not to do so!

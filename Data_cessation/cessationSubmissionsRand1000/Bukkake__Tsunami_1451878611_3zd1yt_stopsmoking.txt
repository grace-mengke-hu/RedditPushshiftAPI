So it's real after all.

[My last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/3z0yug/this_is_not_a_new_years_resolution_i_accidentally/) got almost no attention, which makes sense because it was pretty wishy-washy. I wasn't entirely certain if this was gonna be a serious attempt.

Well, today I gave away all my leftover tobacco and cigarettes. And I installed an app for people who quit smoking. I'm 30 minutes away from 5 full days.

There's a serious fear of failure now that it's real. That's a good thing. I think I'm on the right track.

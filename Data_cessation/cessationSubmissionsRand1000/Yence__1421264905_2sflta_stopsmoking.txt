After one week smoke-free I'm struggling. Don't know what to do with my stress.

Although I can come up with reasons why I quit and all I just feel like I don't give a shit anymore and that it all wasn't that bad after all to smoke. Argh I thought the withdrawal symptoms would be getting better, but the cravings only seem to get worse.

Besides cravings (that used to pass, but today it's suddenly a lot worse) I have occasional stomach aches and I eat like a pig, but nothing too bad.

Day 3 - there was a cigarette on the counter this morning!

It's 5:30 am and the very beginning of day 3 for me.  I came down the stairs this morning and when I went to start my cup of coffee,  there was a cigarette sitting right there in front of the coffee maker.

I'm sure my husband meant to grab it on his way out the door to work this morning,  but he left it there by accident.  Was not a good way to wake up on day 3 for me.

AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I flushed it.

I considered not flushing it. I looked at it for a good minute before a I grabbed it up and chucked it in the toilet.

Now I'm sitting here drinking my coffee writing a post on reddit instead of smoking a cigarette. 

I'm in a bad mood now....and trying not to be miffed at my husband. 

*sigh* here's hoping to a smooth day at the office!!!!!

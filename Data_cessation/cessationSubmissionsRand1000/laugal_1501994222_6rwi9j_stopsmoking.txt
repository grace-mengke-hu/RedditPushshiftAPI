A smoke free mission politely asked me to share what has worked thus far so I will.

Smoked 2 packs a day for almost 15 years, on day 19-20ish. Doesn't seem like alot but this time am not fighting my imagination so I know I have won. I am still on vacation from work so I go out all the time, drink, am around smokers constantly at indoor bars and every other imaginable tempting situation and am not phased this time. Right at first I drank more to compensate which was very weird for me but oddly enough it worked. My friends are still kind of in shock that their resident chimney is out and about and smoke free.

Simple version, if you slip just try again. Don't use thia as an excuse to keep slipping. I used to read posts on here just to find those where people slipped so I could justify doing it myself (manipulative asshole brain compartment running rampant). I started quitting in December with good and weak attempts since. This time it just worked. To sum it up, there are no magic tricks, don't hide from the world, best reason I can come up with is that... I just never quit quitting even when I quit quitting for a moment I quit the failed quit with a new quit remembering that the whole point is to quit til you wanna quit quitting so badly that you just quit quitting and just fucking finally enough with the quitting shenanigans and quit already. 

...and when you get the Aha! moment it feels fucking awesome.

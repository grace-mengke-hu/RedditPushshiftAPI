Woo Hoo 7 Months

Here we go again. My monthly pat on my back and big thank you to Allan Carr. His book made it easy for me to quit. I tried and failed 100's of times. 1.5 packs a day over 40 years (average: 289,600 cigarettes, 14,480 packs and around $75,000.00) Today I am a non-smoker. I didn't attempt to quit. I wasn't trying to quit. I QUIT! Mr. Carr spoke the truth about smoking, why we think we smoke, nicotine addiction and dispelled all the bullshit lies about smoking and quitting. Quitting is only as hard as we believe it to be. Armed with the truth, it was EASY to quit this time. No withdrawal, no cravings, no NRT. Done, finished, good-bye cigarettes. Thanks everyone here for your help.

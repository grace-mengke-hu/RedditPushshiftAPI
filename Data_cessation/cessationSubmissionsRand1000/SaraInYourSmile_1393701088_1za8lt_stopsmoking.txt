I made it!

Day 3 was so much harder than I thought it would be.  I got some great advice from some of you guys yesterday though, and just kept reminding myself to push on because it will be worth it.

I was concerned last night about going to a party with my friends, but went, had a few beers and didn't touch a cigarette! I won't lie, there were tempting moments, but I pushed through, and I felt so incredibly happy this morning when I woke up.  I'm so proud of myself, and just want to tell you guys who are on Day 1, 2, 3, or beyond that it gets better and it's totally worth it!  I feel great today.  Much happier and my lungs are clearing up.  Push through it guys, you're worth it!

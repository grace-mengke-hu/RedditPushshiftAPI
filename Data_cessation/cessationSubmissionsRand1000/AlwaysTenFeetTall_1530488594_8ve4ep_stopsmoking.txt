6 years smoke free!

Hey, just wanted to drop by and say:

YOU GOT THIS.

I am six years smoke free as of today.

2,190 days

$11,000 not spent on cigarettes.

I used this subreddit just like you all. I tried to quit multiple times and finally it stuck.

Hang in there. You got this... if you mess up, hang tight, and try again. You WILL eventually succeed and it will be LIFE CHANGING.

Since quitting smoking I have gone on to run a bunch of marathons and ultra-marathons. I have a whole new life I never thought was possible.

I don't even remember ever being a smoker. It is just unreal.

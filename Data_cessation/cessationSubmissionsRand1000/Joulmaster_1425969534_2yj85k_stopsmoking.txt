That "AHHH" moment that cigarettes give is actually an ancient evolved part of our brain chemistry only to be used, after we actually have done something useful to our survival.

Something about this realization, and realizing that dopamine isn't just something you should be able to trigger made me really contemplate the mental effects of smoking. I want to be happy and I think all of us deserve that for once. 

To elaborate: I have started to notice I get a real feeling of that "AHHH" after I clean my house, take a shower, or really expend work that I know should be done. I used to only get this feeling with cigs now I can feel the effects starting to shape my behavior into a generally positive life style.

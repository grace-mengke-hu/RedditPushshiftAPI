8 Days in and I don't get it... it seems easy. I don't buy it.

I smoked the last cigarette 8 days ago. Almost gave up on Sunday but didn't let my stupid addicted brain beat me at this game of wills. That was my only difficult moment.

Other than that I've been finding this easy. Waaay too easy. I sometimes remember "yeah, smoking one after a big dinner... that would be nice" or smoking one when I'm just standing waiting for something, just to pass the time. But it's easy to just say "no way". Too easy.

**So, my question is:** any of you ever felt like it was really easy in the beginning and then faced a week-long or month-long withdrawl stage eventually? Or, on the contrary, for some people it's just easy. They just give up and that's it?

I appreciate any feedback! Continue staying strong, dear colleagues of mine in this quest for a healthier life!

EDIT: Oh, and btw, I quit cold turkey. The thing I do when I get cravings is to put a toothpick in my mouth and simulate a cigarette. This makes it even more ridiculous! I mean... is this really what it takes to quit smoking? Toothpicks? I REALLY want this to be true, but I'm too much of a pessimist or a realist to buy this.

EDIT2: I see some people think I'm just bragging for writing this. Although I am happy that this is going ok for me, the idea behind this post was to ask the questions above and not to say it was **easy** to quit smoking. Now I understand it was a very, VERY poor choice of words. I never meant to imply something as moronic as that.

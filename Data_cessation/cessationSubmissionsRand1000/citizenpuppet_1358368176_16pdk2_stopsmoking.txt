The effect of smoking in cinema/television

Last night, I went to see "Gangster Squad," and even though I was on day 45 and had absolutely no drive to light up a smoke, I regardless found myself drawn to the characters' onscreen smoking, almost in jealousy. Of course, I abstained, but still found this sensation curious. 

So, I guess... let us not forget the power of these evil cancer sticks, they are not be underestimated.

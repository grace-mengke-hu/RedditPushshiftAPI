Ran my first 5k!

Well, not quite, since whomever was leading the pack took a turn when they weren't supposed to.

My pup and I ran our longest run, 2.87 miles (according to fitbit), in 30:22. Our best distance, our best time, and it was fun! I didn't feel like I was going to keel over, just kept moving...

I know I wouldn't have ever been able to do this while smoking. I've never felt more amazing!

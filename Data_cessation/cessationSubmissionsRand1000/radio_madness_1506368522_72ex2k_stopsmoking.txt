I can't seem to make it anymore

I'm so depressed and really beating myself up that I can't make it more than a couple hours anymore without failing. I had quit for 20 days, then fell for the "just one". That was the worst mistake I've ever made. Since then I've made it another 3 days, then failed.

Now, as if some cruel joke I can't make it even a day. I'll toss my smokes and make it for a few hours then get more as if on auto pilot.

I'm really discouraged, and if I could cry I would. I don't want to smoke, but it seems like now I've just reinforced it further. I've read The Easy Way twice. The first time is what got me to 20 days. There is no "ah ha" moment anymore.

I don't know what to do

Brain fog!

So I came on here and saw a bit ago that my flair (got the badge yesterday) was still saying 3 days, even though I told badgebot I quit on 3/25/2019. Shouldn't I have passed the 4 day mark if I literally quit at midnight, the moment it became 3/25? 

Anyway, so I thought about it and figured I was thinking wrong or there was a time zone issue, so I msgd badgebot again and made the date 3/24/2019. Now it shows 5 days, lol. That is definitely wrong. I am on my 5th day, but haven't completed 5 days. 

I feel like an idiot, but cut me some slack, b/c I'm still early days, lol. I just msgd badgebot AGAIN, changing it back to the true, original 3/25/2019. No more messing with the badge. Badgebot knows all.

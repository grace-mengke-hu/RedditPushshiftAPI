My best run so far!

Sitting here cooling down after my first 2 mile run in under 20 minutes :D I want to finish a 5k in under 30 minutes, so this is a good start.

I never ran while I was a smoker and I'm generally out of shape. I'm not overweight but I would get winded easily. This is something I would have never tried as a smoker as it just felt like too much work to actually feel improvement.

Keep at it ex-smokers. We are getting better everyday :]

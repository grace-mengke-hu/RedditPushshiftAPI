Coming up on 24 hours

This is the longest I've ever gone with no cigarettes and no nicotine replacements. I smoked for nearly 5 years and had to quit because the cigarettes were messing with my meds. I'm honestly grateful for that because without it I'm sure I never would have stopped. I also quit drinking not too long ago.

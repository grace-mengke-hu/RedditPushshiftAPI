My final quit

It's time. After 13 years of solid smoking and two years of concerted and failed efforts to stop, tonight I will smoke the last cigarette of my life. 
I read Alan Carr again. I'm starting Wellbutrin tomorrow morning. Everyone I know knows I'm quitting and supports me. I know my triggers, I have my backup plans. The only thing left is to inhale the shit deeply one last time and exhale forever, gladly, no looking back, free at last. 

I recently quit drinking and found that subreddit community so helpful and am encouraged with what I've seen here, so thank you all for sharing your successes and struggles and keep going strong.  Smoking has been a crutch in the past three sober weeks but I see right through it and am happy to be taking steps to better my mental health rather than keep feeding it smoke-filled lies. 

I'm going to check back in a few hours as I take the last drags of my last cigarette. Any words of encouragement would be so helpful, and I'll keep checking in as I progress in the coming days and weeks. Thank you all.

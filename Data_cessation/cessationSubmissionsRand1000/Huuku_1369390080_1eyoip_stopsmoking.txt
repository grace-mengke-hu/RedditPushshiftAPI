It's been 60 days

Hey, I'm just passing by to say that today my smoke free days count to 60 :) One of the things that helped me make it so far was this reddit and I want to thank you all.
 
You guys are great. It's not just only the support and the nice advices. What motivates me is that I see so many people qutting successfully here and also a lot of guys leading their own fights together with me.

After 60 days which I believe are neither a lot nor a few I have found a rather unexpected side effect from not smoking. It has boosted my confidence. After all if I can go without smokin for 60 days, having smoked for the last 9 years, then I may well be able to do someething more. So I've started to live healthier overall - I've been working out quite often, stooped eating such huge ammounts of junk food and started to pay more attention to my health.

I hope this lasts as long as possible and want you to know that you should be given credit for that too. Wish you all luck not only in quitting smoking but in every little or big struggle that you are having with yourself.

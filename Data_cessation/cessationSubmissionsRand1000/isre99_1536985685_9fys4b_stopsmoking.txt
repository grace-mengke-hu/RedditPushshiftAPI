Intense cravings and disorientated/foggy feeling

**Background:** 19(M) who started smoking around 15. It was pretty much smoking on and off till I turned 18 when I could buy cigarettes. I became a real smoker my 18th year. Light cigarettes and 1-3 per day/Max. About 4 months ago I realized that the light cigarettes I was smoking no longer gave me the buzz I enjoyed or the nicotine craving I needed. I didn't really want to become addicted to cigarettes but all that smoking caught up to me eventually. So I moved onto stronger cigarettes and increased my intake (3-4 cigs per day). However, I then found myself in a huge mess. I couldn't concentrate in class if I didn't smoke. I couldn't read if I didn't have my nicotine. I would get restless and my body would beg for that fix. Worst of all, I was a closet smoker so I couldn't really satisfy my cravings when I wanted to. However on 9/12, I smoked my last cig before class.

Ever since I quit I've been feeling very disorientated and in a constant fog-like mode. I'm slow to reacting and things are not as sharp "up there".  Accompanying the horrible mental stuff, I've had nothing but nonstop cravings. I feel worn out and just want to smoke but I keep telling myself no. I miss smoking in the early-morning before the sun came up or before the sun went down. I want those euphoric rushes again when I exhale the first drag of my cig. I would smoke enough cigarettes to make me feel buzzed in that particular moment which is what I loved. My hands are sweaty and homework is difficult for me to get done. Reading is like torture knowing that I can not reward myself with a smoke at the end of a chapter. Has anyone had similar symptoms? What advice would you guys give me? Anything is appreciated.

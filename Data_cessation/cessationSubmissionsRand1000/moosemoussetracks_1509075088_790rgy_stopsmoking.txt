6 weeks, 3 weeks...

6 weeks ago tomorrow I started taking Zoloft to treat my depression and OCD.  It came with some side effects, but overall I started feeling a lot better.

Better enough, in fact, to quit drinking.  Tomorrow will mark 3 weeks since I had my last sip of alcohol.  (I know, I should've stopped as soon as I started taking Zoloft, but you know, addiction.  Also, I owe a big thank you to r/stopdrinking!)

6 weeks ago tomorrow, 3 weeks ago tomorrow...maybe it's the OCD in me, but I really like the idea of bettering myself in 3 week intervals.  Tomorrow sounds like the perfect day to quit smoking.

I'm half-laughing at my own reasoning, but I'm serious about quitting.  I've wanted to quit smoking for years now.  But it's been awhile since I've gone even 24 hours without smoking.  Tomorrow I'll really need your help.

I've got my of copy of Allen Carr, a pack of cinnamon gum, and some sour patch kids.  Anything else you'd recommend?

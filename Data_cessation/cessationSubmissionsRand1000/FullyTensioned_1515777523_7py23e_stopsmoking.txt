Today a little grumpy

I'm closing in on the end of day two and it's been a pretty constant struggle to not bite anyone's head off.
Luckily seemed to have largely pulled it off. Maybe a little snippy now and again. Really hoping tomorrow is easier being the weekend.
Was always my plan to be on day 5 on Monday when work kicks off in earnest.
Hope my cunning plan comes together. Good luck all of you with your quits. You've all been a big help to me so far with mine ðŸ˜…

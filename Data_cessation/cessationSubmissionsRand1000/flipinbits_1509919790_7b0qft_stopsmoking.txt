Slipped Up

I was out with some coworkers for drinks on Friday then decided to hit up a club solo after the group split for the night. I was pretty confident that smoking wouldn’t be an issue since I’ve been to several bars / concerts and have had very little problems staying away from smoking for the last 20 days.

Well, without the spectacle of a concert or the friends to keep me distracted I fell back on old habits and found myself outside socializing with the smokers asking to bum a smoke. One dude hand rolled me a cigarette which didn’t taste nearly as shitty as I had hoped. 

That’s it though. I had 1 cigarette and was disappointed with myself for about 10 minutes. I decided that it would not deter me from from my ultimate goal. 2 days later, I’m back on the wagon. I haven’t had a cigarette or the urge to buy a pack since.

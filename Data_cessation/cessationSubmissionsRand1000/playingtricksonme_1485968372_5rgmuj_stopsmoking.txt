Going to the dentist for a cleaning

I haven't gone in 3 years and the last time I went I was a nonsmoker. I'm worried they will be disgusted with me and the damage I've done to my mouth from smoking for a year.

On the plus side this should help me stay away from cigarettes because I won't want to mess up the cleaning.

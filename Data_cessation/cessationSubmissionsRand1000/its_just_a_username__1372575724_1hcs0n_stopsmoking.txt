3 months smoke free, never made it this far before!

Guys, I made it to 3 months, I never thought I could do it. It feels good not being addicted anymore. I started jogging the day I quit smoking (and I still do it today). Jogging really helps.

Sometimes I really wish I had a cigarette, just one, but I know that one is enough to ruin all of my progress and make me start over from day 0. So I won't do it. Be strong people!

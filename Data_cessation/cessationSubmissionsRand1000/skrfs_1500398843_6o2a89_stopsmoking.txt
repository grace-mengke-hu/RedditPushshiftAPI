Should I re-read Allen Carr?

I haven't smoked in 40 something days and for the most part, it has been pretty easy (aside from the first week). I still have cravings every day but they are getting easier to brush off. I am also able to go out and drink with friends who smoke without too much difficulty. 

My biggest concern is seeing people who have gone years and relapsed. Would there be any harm in re-reading Easy Way for precautionary reasons? 

Thoughts?

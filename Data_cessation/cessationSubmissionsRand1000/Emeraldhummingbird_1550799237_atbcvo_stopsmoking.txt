When you know better, do better

I approached this quit differently because I realised something about myself I hadn't thought of before. That is, I'm not just addicted to smoking I'm also addicted to the thrill of taboo smoking.

I grew up in a strict religious household. To be honest I started smoking to rebel against my mother who was unbearable at times and it gave me a mental escape from an abusive childhood.

That said I kept smoking a secret because it wouldn't have gone well for me to get caught.  I always got a major thrill from getting away with it. Until of course I was so addicted it could no longer be hidden and I had left home really young anyway.

I realised this thrill was still ingrained in me though because every time I've tried to quit in the past I have experienced that same thrill of sneaking ciggarettes which has been my undoing every single time. The more I got away with it the more I enjoyed it, the more I sabotaged my quit.

I realised if this time was to be different I had to not just address the addiction but acknowledge the fact that I also get a rush from smoking in secrecy. I never really understood why I kept failing but it finally all clicked and I realised I was only cheating myself and just how important not one puff ever is.

Truth is  I can sneak a smoke any time and nobody would know, I could get away with it. But here's the thing I would know and now that I know part of my craving is just chasing a thrill it's less appealing. I know better now so I'm going to do better. I'm now focusing on getting my thrills from being a better and improved version of myself.

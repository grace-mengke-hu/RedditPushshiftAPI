16 days smoke 3 and boy what a hellish first 2 weeks I have had

Cravings have been unbelievably to a minimal maybe 2-3 meltdown moments when I nearly caved but gladly did not but some of the withdrawals I have had have been horrible I have had swollen tonsils for 3 weeks now I had horrible neck pains down one side tension headaches so so very tired at stupid times and I go to sleep so early of a night now and I have yet to start coughing up any phlegm or nastys so I reckon I have more to come but on a positive I'm still feeling positive towards my smoke free future

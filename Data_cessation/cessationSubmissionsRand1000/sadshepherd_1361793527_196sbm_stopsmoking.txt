Whoops, smoked a few cigs on Saturday. Time to reset. 

Was drinking and seeing friends bought a small pack and smoked half of them, sharing the rest out. I've had a complete lack of discipline week with regards to food and exercise too - so I can see why it happened. Time to get back on track. I regret it, because I'd reached 40 days and told myself thats when you start wanting to smoke again and I was going to re-read Allan Car before it happened but I didn't manage it. I thought I'd make a post and become re-integrated with the community here at stop smoking again. *Feels sheepish*

The woman in the elevator.

Just moments ago I went down stairs to check the mail as I do every day at 3 pm. I enjoy this short little break from my desk even though it is very short and I'm only checking the mail. Since my office in on the 8th floor and I wear heels everyday, I ride the elevator to spare my poor footsies. On my journey back upstairs after retrieving the mail a woman entered the elevator lobby the same time I did. Once we were on the elevator and the doors closed it hit me. A giant wall of smoke. It was as if there was a lit cigarette in the elevator car. I actually gagged, which is unheard of for me (yes, my bf loves that ha ha.) She snapped at me and said,"You better not throw up in here. It'll make this elevator smell horrible!" I shit you not, she actually fricking said that. My jaw would have hit the floor, but I didn't want to chance inhaling the smoke that was still billowing from her lungs. She got off a few floors before me, but that didn't quite get rid of the smell. As soon as I reached my floor I sprayed my perfume so I could smell something pleasant again. 




I'm so happy I don't smell like that anymore, because I know I used to be the smokey woman people were trapped in the elevator with.

Stopped buying two weeks ago. Need to stop bumming!

I haven't bought a pack since June 14th, which is the longest I've gone since I started 17 years ago. I've bummed here and there though - coworkers, neighbors, friends. I've been successfully through the ringer of triggers too without a cigarette. A fight with the SO, drinking alcohol/coffee, grilling outdoors - all things where I "had" to smoke while doing it. I've been going days just fine and then the craves start creeping up on me. Last time I bummed was Saturday: 3 cigarettes, I was pissed at myself the next day but I just told myself no more. 

Last couple nights though have been really really hard! I kept looking out my window to see if a neighbor was outside. Now I'm at work and I'm feeling it so bad. I know if I bum one I'll feel bad for doing it, but these cravings are making me a basket case!

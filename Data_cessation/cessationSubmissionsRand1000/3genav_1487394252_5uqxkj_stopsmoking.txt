Two weeks smoke free!

It pretty much happened by accident too. I was always half assedly trying to quit, and only smoked when I drank (sometimes I'd buy a pack when I knew I was going to be drinking and craving some smokes that night and then smoke the rest throughout the rest of the week), but over the past two weeks I just haven't had any. It feels great. I went three weeks with no smokes over Christmas break, and now these past two weeks, and now all I get is the small, short lived craving every now and then.

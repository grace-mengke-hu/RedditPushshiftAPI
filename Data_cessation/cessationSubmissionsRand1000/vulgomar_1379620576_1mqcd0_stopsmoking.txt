Day 4, some struggles, some victories

Hey, everyone. I just wanted to come here, honestly to pat myself on the back. I've struggled with quitting for a long time, but I finally found a program that really clicked with me ([Freedom From Smoking](http://www.ffsonline.org/) if anyone is interested).

Anyhow, today was the first day that I really had any urges at all, but I handled it really well and I'm incredibly proud of myself. I practiced my self-talk, saying out loud that I do not want to smoke and that the urge will pass, and then I called my buddy for a long conversation about my reasons for quitting and my successes so far.

That's really it, just feeling good about myself and wanted to share. Thanks for the support!

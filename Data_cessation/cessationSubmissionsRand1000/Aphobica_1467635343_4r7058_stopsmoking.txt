4th day.

Woo!

The junk in the back of my throat is already clearing up, and breathing in seems to be easier already. I do notice that I'm very irritable lately so I'm trying to avoid people for the time being. I start back work tonight,  so I'll be fighting a whole new set of triggers. If I can make it to Friday, I can drop them for good. 

Hope everyone is having a good nic-free 4th of July :]

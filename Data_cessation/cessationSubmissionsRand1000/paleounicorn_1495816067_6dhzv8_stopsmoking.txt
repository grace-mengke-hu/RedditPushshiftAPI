Day 3 & feeling it

My quit knock on wood hasn't been horrible these 3 days so far. But I'm stilling here at my desk starting to become angry and upset because I legit will never be able to just enjoy one. I'm an addict. I can't bum one from a friend when I'm drunk or just randomly because just one will lead to the start of my addiction again. I know it's the nicotine monster trying to mess with me, but in 2 weeks I have a weekend planned to go to a parade and drink. I'm already freaking out about it. Is it natural? My cravings haven't been horrible and I don't want to be a smoker ever again.

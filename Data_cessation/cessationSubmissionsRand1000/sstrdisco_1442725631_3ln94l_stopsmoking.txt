Oh hello five months!

I just hit the five month mark and am happy to report I'm still smoke free. The cravings have eased up (though I still have them), breathing keeps getting easier, my taste buds are still changing, my sense of smell is also still changing, everyone who knows I quit is super proud of me, and most of all I am proud of me. I also hit a point where I focus less on recovery and more on living. It's been a nice change.

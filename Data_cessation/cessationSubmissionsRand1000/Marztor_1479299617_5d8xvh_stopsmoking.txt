Insomnia causing absentmindedness

So I've been really struggling with insomnia since I quit and this morning it just got silly.

Drove all the way to work and had made my coffee before realising I had put odd shoes on.

Didn't get any better when the door handle snapped in my hand when I went home to change.

If I don't laugh I'll cry but at least I'm not tempted to smoke!

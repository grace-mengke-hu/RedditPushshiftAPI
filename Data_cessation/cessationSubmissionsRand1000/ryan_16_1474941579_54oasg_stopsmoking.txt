hey, it's been a while

decided today I should quit. I went and bought a $40 vape pen as that helped me quit in the past. on another note I got over my budding alcohol addiction. drank every night for a month this summer and made real good friends with the doctor. blood was fine as of a few weeks ago and I can now enjoy a weekend night of drinking with the boys without feeling hooked. drugs don't mix well for me due to my antidepressants. breaking the cycle one step at a time. please join me in not smoking tomorrow.

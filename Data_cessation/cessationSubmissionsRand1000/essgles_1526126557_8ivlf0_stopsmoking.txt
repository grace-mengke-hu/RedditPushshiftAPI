To quit or not to quit?

Me: Time to quit smoking! Better throw away my cigarettes and grit my teeth through the next few days.

Also me: You have ADHD and two exams to worry about. Now isn't the time for brain fog. Buy some cigarettes!! 

Advice needed guys. I feel I may be putting my MSc exams at risk as I know withdrawl always hits me hard. First one is on Wednesday and today is my third quit attempt in three days (my longest quit was around 2 years previously). 

What do I do? Wait for the end of exams or just try and get through it ?!

Craving a cigarette? Don't give in! YOU GOT THIS!

It's been a really long time since I've visited this sub. The sub that pretty much saved my life. I just wanna give back a little bit.

12 year smoker - pack a day

I read Allen Carr's book and quit cold turkey a little more than a year ago. Best decision of my life. 

So I honestly didn't think it was possible when I first quit. I thought there was no way in hell I was gonna have such a huge number next to my star up there. But...

Days 1 - 3 passed (hardest days ever). Week 1 was over with and I had no idea how I was going to make it to a month. A month later WHAT A MILESTONE! Then another, and another... Hang in there, it's going to get better, I promise. If it didn't -- I'd be killing for a cigarette right now. 

Cravings will do 1 of 2 things. Either they will get to you and make you go to the store, buy that pack, open it up, and smoke that cigarette or it passes. LET THE CRAVING PASS. Hang tight. I know it's all you can think about right now but just wait it out! When it really got to me, I would visit this sub, read a bunch of encouraging posts, and write a little post myself. Half way through, my craving is pretty much gone!

I can't even remember what it's like to be a smoker anymore. I am a brand new person. Just get by craving by craving. 

YOU GOT THIS!

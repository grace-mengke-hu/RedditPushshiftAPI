Hi, my name is Sebastian, and I'm on my first day without a smoke.

I just thought I'd better leave a mark somewhere, so I would have a harder time finding excuses to start again. This is not the first time I tried to quit, I failed many times throughout the last year. But this has to be the real deal, smoking just generally stands in my way in all regards. So: Hello r/stopsmoking, my name isn't really CrazedPsycho, and I quit smoking today, september 23rd 2016.

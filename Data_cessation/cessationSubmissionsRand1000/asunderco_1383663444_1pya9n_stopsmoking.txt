Thank You r/stopsmoking!

One year. . . I didn't think I'd ever be here, and I wouldn't be without the help and guidance I received from all of these caring people I have never even met. 

Also thank you for implementing the badge system. It kept me on my path multiple times during hard cravings where I would look at my small number and not want to have to see that same number twice.  

I can't thank all you strangers enough. Congrats to all my *non-smoking* redditors. Stay strong. 

Cheers.

1 year. Posting today because I will forget about smoking again by tomorrow!

The first 3 days. Physical withdrawal. It's the only willpower grind. Eating cheesies and doing runs worked and counteracted each other.

3 weeks. The mind game. Breaking all the automatic associations, breaking the habit. Will doesn't last long, but being resolute does. You have made a choice to quit smoking and you are sticking by it. No looking back. This makes it all much easier.

3 months. The emotional challenge. Turning over the 1000 stones. I used to smoke when .... I enjoyed a smoke when .... The guard is going down so there are risks of getting caught unexpectedly with a sad feeling, that life would be better with an occasional smoke. All lies.

1 year. A recent ex-smoker cannot believe that smoking truly sucks. The best they can do is think there is a tradeoff, the "joy" of smoking vs their health/money etc. I can tell you with certainty that I pity smokers. What a sad addiction I got sucked into. I am much happier without it.

I am very proud of quitting smoking for a year. Honestly, I rarely think about it anymore, and when I do, I smile because I have quit for good. I wanted to come back and post at 1 year but honestly I couldn't remember the date, and by tomorrow I will have forgot again. 

Brave on warriors. You are on your way to absolute freedom from smoking.

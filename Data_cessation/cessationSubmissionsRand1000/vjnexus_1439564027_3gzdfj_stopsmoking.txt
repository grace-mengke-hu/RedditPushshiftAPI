You are all dicks and I hate you, but dammit you're right.

I quit the gum cold turkey 2 days ago. 13 days since a cigarette, 41 hours since nicotine of any kind. This is hard, but knowing you guys are here and know what it's like helps. I am stronger than this. And I don't really hate you all. I'd hug you all, but I can't stand human contact this second.

Edit: 80ish hours and going strong. Cravings come and go, but I get through them. Grumpy. Strong. Time to clean the basement.

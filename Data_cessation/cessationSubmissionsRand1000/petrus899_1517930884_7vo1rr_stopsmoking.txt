Really weird dream...

So in about 5 hours I'll officially be on day 2 of my quit. Last night I had an insanely vivid, yet mundane dream- I found myself sitting at my work desk and all of a sudden had this overwhelming craving to smoke. In the dream I ended up caving and had the smoke, but woke up immediately after feeling kind of sick. I was able to fight through the cravings the day prior, but I just found it really weird that I gave in so easy in my dream. Anyone else here ever experience something similar? Should I anticipate that this will be a reoccurring thing for awhile? Any feedback would be much appreciated!

Day One.

I'm out of work and living with my parents for a while to save money and get back on my feet, and that financial situation is making it really obvious how badly I need to quit. Both my parents are moderate-heavy smokers, however, so that will be an extra challenge. 

I've quit for shortish periods twice before, 

For a while, I was on bupropion as an antidepressant, and it did totally make me stop smoking. However, it also completely screwed up my mental space, and once I was in hospital because those pills had made me *try to kill myself* I totally relapsed on the smoking. 

A year and a half ago, I had pneumonia, and didn't touch a cigarette because I absolutely could not. I think I had one cigarette over the course of four days. When I recovered, I was using an e-cigarette for about three months, but somehow ended up back with tobacco. 

Tactics I use already are playing solitaire on my phone to keep my hands busy, and applying lip balm any time I have the urge. 
I suspect my two biggest challenges will be boredom and my smoking family. 

But I have six cigarettes left in my pack, and I'm going to keep those around as long as possible (my goal is to still have smokes in that pack by the time they hit their expiry date), and not cave and buy a new pack. 

I'm posting this here, because I know my need to keep my word will be a good factor as far as willpower goes. 

So, let me know what to expect, some techniques for dealing with the issues I'm concerned about, and just general support might be groovy.

I keep wanting to make milestone posts but I keep forgetting!

I'm at 804 days now so that's 2 years 2 months and 2 weeks since my last cigarette, I guess that's sort of a milestone right? I take it as a good thing though that I don't think about coming here as often as I used to but this community has been amazing for me and I want to thank you all for that!

To all the new quitters: you can do it! Don't give up!

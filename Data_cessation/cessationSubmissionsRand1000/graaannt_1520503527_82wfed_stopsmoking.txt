Does anybody else get this?

So I quit last night at 8pm (GMT) and I've tried quitting before but failed but I'm determined for this to be the time it happens. However; I get a really weird sensation, for want of a better word in my forehead and in my jaw at both sides. It's not pain or tingling or anything like that, but it feels like something is there. I don't quite know how to explain it.

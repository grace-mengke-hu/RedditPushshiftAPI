Thank you guys for the perspective!

Sometimes you read posts here, where new quitters thank some senior quitters for their insight and such. I would like to turn the tables for once and thank any new- or not-so-newbie here for their stories of struggle. I had a phase with some more urges a few weeks back and you guys reminded me of what a long way I already came. And also as of now, I'm feeling a bit low and you guys remind me of what I have accomplished almost a year ago. So thank you, thank you for the perspective! Have a great day!

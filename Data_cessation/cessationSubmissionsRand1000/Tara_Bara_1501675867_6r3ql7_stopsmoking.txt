One Week

Not sure if my badge has been updated yet, but I'm officially 1 week into my cold turkey quit. Smoked a pack a day (more or less) for 19 years, and I'd be lying to you if I said I don't miss smoking, because I do. There are some days I pray to God to send a meteor crashing towards earth just so I can justify going to the store to buy a pack. He never sends one.

I'm not sure what's kept me going the past 7 days. Mostly the fact that I literally can't stand looking myself in the mirror anymore, so long as I'm disrespecting myself by smoking. One perk to quitting I HAVE noticed, however, is that by taking care of myself in this one (very important) way, I put a lot more care into the other aspects of my daily existence (everything from making my bed in the morning, to flossing my teeth). Put another way, I'm "giving more fucks" now because I'm giving the biggest "fuck" of all...quitting smoking. 

If that makes any sense.

I know Allen Carr's a big hit on this forum, and I did read his book. Another person who's made a huge impact on me (and not just the quit, but yeah...the quit too) is Jordan Peterson. He's a clinical psychologist, public speaker, and professor at the University of Toronto. His snippets on YouTube are so profound, it's like being hit over the head by the sledge hammer of truth with a capital 'T': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0Qm8I2cCAE

If you're struggling, definitely listen to his stuff. I'd be surprised if he didn't help you. Good luck everyone.

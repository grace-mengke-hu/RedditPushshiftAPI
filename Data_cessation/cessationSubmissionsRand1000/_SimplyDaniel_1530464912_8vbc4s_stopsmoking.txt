Day One

Day one, all over again, I have to reset my badge which I will do after this post. I bought a pack and then smoked it till I smoked them all. It started when I was drinking with a friend. I'm not sad I'm more in pain because my chest is on fire and I feel groggy and it was really hard for me to get up this morning. Just another reminder that we have to stay vigilant and also this is why smoking sucks.

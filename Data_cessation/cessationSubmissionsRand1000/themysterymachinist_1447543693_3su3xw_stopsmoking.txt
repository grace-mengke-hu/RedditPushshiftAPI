Fell Off the Wagon, But I feel Good.

Yeah, so yesterday sucked, not only because of the Paris attacks but because I got two spam emails from a very dear friend of mine who died in May, and heard from my ex boyfriend and I decided, ok, stepping off this wagon. 
I woke up today and had a headache, and I realized, yeah, not the best way to deal. I feel actually enriched by it tho. And its been a great adventure this week, feeling my body recover, my lips get pinker, my brain working fully. 
Maybe failure isn't failure at all, but a sort of compression/expansion like breathing- we fail, we try, we fail, we try, we try, we try, til we succeed. 
NOTHING will stop me trying. I will never smoke for more than a day, and those four days I earned are a drop in the bucket to what I shall earn. 
Life without smoking is ACTUALLY BETTER. Its better. Period. I am really getting this through my thick skull now. 
If you rue your failures, you will only succumb totally to failure. Failure means you stop trying. And no way will I stop trying this time. 
I hope you guys made it through for another day!

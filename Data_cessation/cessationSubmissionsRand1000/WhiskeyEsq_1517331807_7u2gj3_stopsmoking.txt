Quit before 30

I'm 50 days cigarette free and just turned 30 yesterday. I so want to be able to say I quit smoking before turning 30. Going strong so far. There have definitely been temptations, but staying strong. Know that just one will have me hooked all over again. Thanks for the support here, as always!

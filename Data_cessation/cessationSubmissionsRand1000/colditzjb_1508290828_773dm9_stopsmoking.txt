Harm-reduction: vaping and cigars?

I'm having a hard time drawing a bold line between smoking and not smoking. I've had no cigarettes for 5+ days, and this is a big deal for me! But, I've been vaping and smoking occasional cigars to get me through the tougher times. I'm telling myself that this is a step-down and that I can give myself some initial leeway as long as I don't pick up another cigarette. Is that legit?

Any harm-reduction folks out there (e.g., vapers, cigar smokers), or people who have strong feelings about that being a terrible idea? What say you?

P.S. If Allen Carr has some incredible advice about this, please do help me out with a summary. My book has not arrived yet, so no need to tell me to buy the book. Thanks!

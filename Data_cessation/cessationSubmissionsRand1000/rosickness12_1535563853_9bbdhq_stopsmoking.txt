The addiction is long gone. It's the nostalgia I can't kick.

It's like an old friend I had good times with but vow to go separate ways just to run in to them again. I can't kick the bar patio and chatting with a smoke. It's not the typical I smoke when I drink scenerio. It's only that patio and talking with friends or strangers. Easy to say don't go to restaurant bars. I went 100+ days last year. Eventually I'll be at a patio.

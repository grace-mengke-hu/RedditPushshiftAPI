One week.

I've made it a week! It feels amazing. The last few days have been heaps easier than the first few. Once all the nicotine is gone, it really is just about not smoking. Just don't. Some things I've noticed are:

- Support is great. My husband, while still smoking, has been an incredible support. He no longer smokes near me, in the car, even tries to hide at home, which I don't think is necessary, but it's nice. He even surprised me with flowers and a sweet card to celebrate this week. In the card he mentioned that I am an inspiration to him. This makes me so psyched. I would love for him to quit too, and I hope by him seeing that it's doable and even easier than we thought, he will.

- Cravings suck. But then they're gone. In previous attempts at quitting I would all out avoid any potential scenario where I would smoke. Bars, parties, even places around my home where I used to smoke. This time I'm just living my life. I did shy away from alcohol for most of the week, but yesterday I met a friend for drinks at a bar. Plenty of people were smoking, and I was fine. Of course there was that little nagging thought, still romanticizing the idea of having one. But as soon as it came, I dismissed it and moved on. This is huge for me, and I hope it continues.

- Honesty. I have tried to quit many times. Many times I have failed. To be honest, this is the first time I have really quit. That one puff does count, it does start you over, you can't just have one cig and still be quit. I always had a justification for this. Oh it was just a puff, I'm still a week in. No, I wasn't. And not only because it meant I smoked, but because it reintroduced nicotine into my body. No wonder it was so hard. No wonder the cravings wouldn't cease. Because I was still smoking. Now that the nicotine is really gone, the cravings are fleeting and mental. My body feels great, and it doesn't need to smoke. And neither does my head. 

Anyway, I just wanted to give an update, and try to reach anyone in the first few days, or maybe thinking about quitting. Do it. Do it. Do it. Keep going. Don't smoke. I'm just taking the first steps of this journey. Seeing the support here has been truly inspiring, and adds accountability to quitting. Thank you all very much for that. I hope I can go as far as most of you!

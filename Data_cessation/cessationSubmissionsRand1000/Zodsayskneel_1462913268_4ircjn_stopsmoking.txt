Broke. Stressed. I WILL NOT SMOKE!

Due to extremely strict budgeting during a tough financial time, and an accidental charge to my account which should be reversed soon, I have literally -$34 in the bank until I get paid on Friday. I could easily bum a cigarette from a co-worker to ease my stress, but will it fix the problem? Of course not. Does a cigarette somehow speed up time? Nope, only brings the end closer.

6 days in, experiencing really terrible anxiety - is this normal?

I don't know if my badge is still there but I've requested it to be removed because I fell off after 5 months of quitting back in May 2017.

Decided recently to try and quit smoking again, so I had my last cigarette on Dec. 26 and haven't touched any since.

The last time that I quit, the most difficult parts for me were the first 3 days (I couldn't sleep at all for those 3 days) and digestive issues (constantly having acid issues, indigestion, etc.)

This time, I went through the same problems sleeping during the first 3 days. However, this time around I'm experiencing some really bad anxiety. There are a couple trigger points that I can recall but those 'issues' are technically resolved but the anxiety hasn't went away.

It's an actual physical response I feel in that there's this tightness and discomfort in my chest and I keep feeling like something bad is going to happen. I overthink the simplest situations/scenarios and have mini panic attacks or break down over things that aren't really that important. 

It's fucking with my relationships with others a lot (especially the girl I'm seeing lately) and it's really starting to worry me.

I wonder if this is just a side effect of withdrawal and quitting or if there is maybe a deeper rooted issue that smoking was concealing until now?

Wondering what the thoughts of others in this sub are, please let me know! It is appreciated.

Also, Happy New Year!

Study breaks are better without a smoke

I'm at about two and half weeks in, and this has just hit me recently. It's nice to go outside and just take everything in--smells, sounds, the sight of nature, etc. Before, I would try to appreciate everything before I lit up, but cravings would distract me too much. Also, there was the smell, worrying about how others saw me, and on and on. Study breaks with a smoke felt "dirty". 

Now, I can go outside, take a break, and come inside feeling truly refreshed without that halfway-pleasant halfway-unpleasant nicotine "buzz". Trust me--it's a lot better.

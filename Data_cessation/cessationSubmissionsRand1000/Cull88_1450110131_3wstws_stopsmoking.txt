Sick of lying to myself

everyday is the same "i'll just smoke today, THEN TOMORROW i'll quit". "i'll just smoke THIS LAST FAG, then i'm done". What a load of bullshit. Utter drivel. I've realised the only time you want to quit is as you're smoking and when it's finished with, when your addiction is being fed/is fed. That is what you need to feed off, the fact that in that moment, your correct decision in your brain is working. Again, last week, I went 4 days and started again. I can't keep lying to myself! So, here we go, one last time.

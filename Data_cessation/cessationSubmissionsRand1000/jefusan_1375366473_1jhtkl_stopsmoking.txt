Smoking and Depression: A Reminder for the New Crop of Quitters

There have been [several](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/12ifu6/smoking_and_depression/) [posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1b656w/smoking_and_depression/) [about](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/pqne6/some_thoughts_about_what_i_have_learned_aka_what/) [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/xby8u/how_to_deal_with_the_postquit_depression/) [before](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/foe7m/existing_depression_and_quitting/), but I thought it might be prudent to remind people that not everyone feels their body and mind get back to normal three days after quitting. It's possible that your smoking may be an attempt at self-medication for an underlying chemical imbalance.

From [PsychCentral.com](http://psychcentral.com/library/depression_smoking.htm):

> New research has suggested that there may be something in cigarette smoke that has antidepressant properties, which explains why cigarette smoking is much more common among depressed patients. A survey of 3,000 individuals in the St. Louis area confirmed that lifetime frequency of major depression was more common among smokers than nonsmokers (6.6 vs. 2.9 percent) This study also demonstrated that smokers who reported at least one episode of major depression were less likely to succeed in smoking cessation programs than smokers without depression (14 vs. 28 percent). These findings have been confirmed many times over.

> There are thousands of chemicals other than nicotine constituents in cigarette smoke, of which one, or several, may affect mood in much the same way as a group of antidepressant medications called monoamine oxidase inhibitors or (MAOIs). These MAOIs effectively increase levels of specific neurotransmitters involved in the regulation of mood. Smoking, therefore, may be a way for depressed individuals to self-medicate depressive symptoms. Consequently, healthcare professionals who offer smoking cessation programs should offer depression screening and be prepared to address underlying mood disorders as part of a comprehensive smoking cessation program.

This isn't to say you shouldn't be quitting, or that fluctuations in mood or energy levels during your quit necessarily indicate clinical depression. I'm just suggesting you keep an eye on yourself while you go through this major life change. If, weeks or months down the line, you can't shake the lethargy, lack of motivation or libido, feelings of sadness or emptiness, or suicidal thoughts... don't hesitate to talk to a doctor. It could be that quitting smoking put you "off your meds" and they need to be replaced.

Myself, I'm hoping my complete lack of energy, motivation, and enthusiasm for the future is a temporary side effect, but I'm preparing myself for the possibility that I may need additional help.

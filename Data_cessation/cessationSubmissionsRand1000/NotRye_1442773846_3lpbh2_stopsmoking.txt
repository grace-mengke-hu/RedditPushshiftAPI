Do "smoking dreams" ever stop?

So today marks my 5th month of escaping nicotine addiction, and it seems that at least once a month I dream that I cave in.  I get that it's normal for ex-smokers, but does it ever stop?  I guess this is a question to those who've gone 1+ years without smoking.  

It would be nice if there ever was a time when I didn't feel that panicked feeling of knowing I messed up - sure it's a relief when I wake up but still, it's stressful at the time.  

Anyway, keep fighting the good fight, y'all!

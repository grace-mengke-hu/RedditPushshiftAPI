Struggling BAD

I just hit 3 weeks yesterday, and was going to stop posting on here because i felt secure in my quit, but today has been brutal and it's not even 10am. I am a nanny, and at my current job the father is a fucking ASSHOLE. He decided this morning to yell at me for not saying hi to him when i said hi to his wife (who was in the baby's room with the baby). I didn't even fucking see the man until he came downstairs and went off on me. I stood up for myself this time. Fuck that. I told him I'm a grown ass woman and that he was not going to continue talking to me that way or i would leave. Long story short... He kept running his mouth then left, and then the mom got on my case telling me that's just how he is and i needed to ignore it and blah blah blah. She left for work, and now I'm just sitting here, fucking stewing over this interaction and pretty sure I'll be fired this evening when he gets home and all i can think about is how much i NEED a damn smoke. This is my first major altercation since quitting, and I'm really worried it's going to make me slip. I know it's junkie thinking and that i am in control of my choices, but I'm feeling really "fuck everything" right now and could use some support.

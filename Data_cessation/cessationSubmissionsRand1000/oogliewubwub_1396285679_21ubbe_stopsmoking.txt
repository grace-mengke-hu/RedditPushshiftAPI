I did it. Tomorrow will be 90 days.

I now walk over a mile each day - up two giant hills without stopping.  I smell better, my taste buds are back, I can smell things and I can breath.
The smell of cigarette smoke actually makes me a little sick to my stomach these days. The cravings are few and very far apart. I am so glad I made the decision to quit (after over 20 years of smoking). It was so hard but SO worth it.  To those of you who are just starting out: Keep it up! You CAN do it. Just grit your teeth and realize it WILL get better!

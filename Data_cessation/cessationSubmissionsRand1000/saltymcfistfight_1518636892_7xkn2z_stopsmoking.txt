11 months smoke free, until my girlfriend left.

She doesn’t use reddit and I’m not taking things well. She helped cure my depression and help me quit smoking. When we met she had no friends, so for over 2 years i helped her get some. 

Her mother and father drink a lot. She loves drinking too, i’m not a fan of it all after my dad passed away from drinking heavily. 

It was going worse and worse for us and just pushing each other away, she now has friends to go out with and gets black out drunk every friday night and sleeps the weekend away. 

I miss her so much, not who she is. I can see her depression and drinking getting worse and worse. I miss who she was so much and I would do anything to have that girl back. 

Went a bought a pack of cigs to help me get through the next few days, before I knew I bought a second pack. My life was amazing with her and I took it for granted. I just need some encouragement to not buy the 3rd pack.

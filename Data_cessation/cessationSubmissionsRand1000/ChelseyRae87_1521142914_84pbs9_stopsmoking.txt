Driving without smoking is normal???

Okay so I have always smoked in the car... Like chain smoked. I would light up as soon as i started the car and then keep a cig lit while i was going. My mom and dad drove like this my whole life. I thought it was what people did.

 When i started driving was when my habit really picked up. Now that i have quit, my car has contained my hardest fought battles. Yesterday I was driving home, and I didn't have a craving really, but i reached for my pack in the door, out of habit i guess, and then i laughed because i wasn't even experiencing a craving, meaning i clearly smoked for no reason a lot of the time. 

I then thought about how my parents always smoked in the car and how i must have learned the habit from them and then started really paying attention to the cars around me and on the opposite side (hello standstill traffic) and noticed that NO ONE was smoking. Literally did not see one cracked window or cloud of smoke. I was the abnormal one for so long doing what I thought grown adults did with their lives, but to really see how i was alone in my habit really struck a chord with me. 

I am learning something new about this addiction every day. I make these little discoveries that really hit me because i feel like the last 15 years of my life i have wasted so much time and money on something that was only normal to me because of my parents. Mind BLOWN y'all. 

I'll never touch another cigarette, and not only that, I'm also going to work hard to get my dad to quit. My mom passed 3 years ago from complications from her lifetime of smoking. She was only 68. My dad is now 78, just had open heart surgery 6 months ago, and is still smoking at least a pack a day (used to be 3 packs!!! ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±). Time to get his shit together i say.

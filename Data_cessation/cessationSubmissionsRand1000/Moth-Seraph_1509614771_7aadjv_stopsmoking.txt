2 days, 18 hrs in. Here's my story.

30 years old, female, been smoking about 11 years at a pack a day. Have quit a few times but never more than a month.

When I was 15 I got cancer (long reason. Not gonna go into it unless asked for more details, non smoking related). Since the age of about 5 have had emotional issues, and from cancer on, been suicidal and depressed, though it's mostly under control with meds. Even heavily medicated, still just "don't want to be here" though. Etc etc. Blah blah blah.

So about a month ago, I got severely sick. Haven't been that sick since chemo treatments zapped my immune system. COULDN'T breathe. Lungs felt full of fluid and felt like I was drowning for more than 2 weeks. I may have depression issues, but I decided that? That's not how I wanna go out! 

Also, I live in a shitty apartment and have been wanting to move. But it seems like everywhere else in this city is either too expensive, or smoke free. 

I'm going at this cold turkey but I'm questioning that decision. I've used patches with great success in the past. Have done it cold turkey too. My biggest thing is the "habit" part. The routine of it all. And I work at a gas station so I'm gonna have to handle the things, physically. I only work weekends, but I'm scared, guys. So far as long as I stay inside my apartment, I'm fine. Because there's nothing to smoke here. I'm safe, here. But I'm wondering how well that will power is gonna hold up outside. And at work. 

I'm struggling today with it. Depression is spiking, doubt creeping in, and dunno if I can do this suddenly. This feels awful and I just want it to be over already so I can move on with my life!

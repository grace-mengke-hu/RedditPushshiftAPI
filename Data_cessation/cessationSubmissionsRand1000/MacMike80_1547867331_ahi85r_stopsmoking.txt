18 days done

Finishing day 18.  Had one quick rough craving that passed in literally 15 seconds today.  I’m hoping the worst has passed but know there will be some situation that makes me want a smoke.  But I’ll kick that cravings ass like I did the last 18 days.  
Everyone just starting- you can do this.  I was smoking at least a pack and a half a day, more when drinking involved.  
If I can, you can.

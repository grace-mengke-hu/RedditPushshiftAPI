Anyone else feel bipolar while quitting?

My anxiety has been through the roof. I've alternated between paralyzing anxiety and manic action for like the past 9 days (I quit 4/9 at 7:39pm). 

I am stacking a lot on my plate right now, which I unfortunately can't control. I quit drinking 2 months before quitting smoking, but also got fired from my job on 3/16 and went through with the quit anyway. 

So essentially I'm trying to balance pursuing claims against my previous company with looking for a new job with taking care of my mental health with quitting smoking, so there's a lot there. So maybe my mania is just a result of inordinate amount of stress due to everything going on.

Buuuut I wanted to check and see if others go through the same thing. Anyone else go a little crazy when quitting smoking?

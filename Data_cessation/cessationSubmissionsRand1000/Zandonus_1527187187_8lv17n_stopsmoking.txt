It's been a while.

I've not checked in for a long long time. Thank you, fellow humans, for all these days. The first 10 were hell. the first hundred were harsh. These other 1000 were a breeze. In the last 500, even the nightmares stopped. I really hope it's going to be as pleasant for you guys, as it was for me. Without the help during the first year from this community, I wouldn't have made it. Just decide.

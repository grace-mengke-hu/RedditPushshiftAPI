5 days in.

5 days in and feeling great. Today was my first day of class since I quit, and not going out for a cig in between classes nearly broke me.

I'm noticing so many positive things about myself, like having a better sleep schedule, eating more regularly (and healthily), and starting to smell and breathe better.

Every day it gets better. DisneyWorld in three weeks with a three year old-- ain't nobody got time for no energy and a nicotine addiction!

Screw it, I'm going to step down my patches to step 3 today.

I have a few days worth of step 2 left but that would leave me stepping down midweek, so I'm going to do it today. I'm a bit hungover so that'll mean my cravings are less as standard (fuck I'm glad I don't have to smoke, that would make me throw up I think). I'm off down South to stay with a friend this morning but it'll be a chilled weekend.

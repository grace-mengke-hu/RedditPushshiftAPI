Tonight, my co-worker that I'd normally occasionally smoke with asked how long it had been since I went out for a smoke. He was wondering if I wanted to step outside. It felt really good to be able to tell him that'd it'll be two weeks tomorrow!

Then he complained about blood sugar and went for a smoke.

Like the title says it's been 14 days. I am still having tons of cravings! I have mostly been replacing it with food and weed.

I am pleased with my decision to use LSD to quit. Would recommend 10/10

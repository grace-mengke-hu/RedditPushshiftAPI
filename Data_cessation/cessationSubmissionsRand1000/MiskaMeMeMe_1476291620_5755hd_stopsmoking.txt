Keep on truckin' you quitters!

All of you out there feeling like you can't do it or it is too much hassle, take heart. You can do it and the effort is worth it 1,000 times over. 

No more thinking, "Do I have cigarettes?  Do I need to buy some?" No more smelling like cigarettes. No more finding time to smoke. No more stressing about getting to that next smoke break.

Looking back now on my smoking self I'm glad I said goodbye to that person. I'm not ashamed of who I was. I was a nicotine addict. But I'm glad I found r/stopsmoking to help me realize I, too, had what was necessary to quit smoking.

My two main weapons were my dismay at my need for nicotine and Allan Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking. Once I understood WHY I was smoking it was possible for me to short circuit the cravings and keep focused on the folly of 'just one' and the benefits of being smoke-free.

If you are thinking about quitting know that it is possible as lots of us here can attest to. Not simple. You may stumble along the way. But there is a non-smoker within all of us just dying to come out.

If you are in the process of quitting but feeling the urge: stand strong. It will go away and it will get better. Believe it or not soon will come a day you never even think about smoking.

If you quit: Let others know how great it is so they can push past the urge, defeat the crave, and join us.

Just made it through a challenging weekend!

One of my favorite places to smoke...camping on the Rogue River.  I was surrounded by family and friends I typically drink and smoke with around the campfire.  It was very difficult, but by day 3 red vines has replaced thoughts of Joe Camel.  

I also used to really enjoy smoking and chewing on the river, but just managed my first raft trip without!

The first of many!  Woo-hoo to me!

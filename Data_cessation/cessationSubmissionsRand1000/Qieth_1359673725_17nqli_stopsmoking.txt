Day 10 - My local kiosk is beginning to suspect something

I still haven't told most people about me quitting cigarettes. The only people who know are my co-workers. No friends, no family, nobody.

I go to the local kiosk almost every day. You know, for just random things. I almost always buy my cigarettes there, but I obviously haven't bought any in the last 10+ days.

So I go in to get a coke, and I say "Just this". The guy - you know, the usual guy, Safi is his name - says "Anything else?" and half turns towards the cigarette racks. I say "Nope". "Really? You sure?", he asks. "Yep, I'm good" I say and swipe my credit card.

He looked at me with that odd look in his eyes. I think he's on to me...

Another campaign.

Yes I failed. And it does feel like that as I really got nothing out of it except a good old proper sense of failure. So going to pick myself up. Do some research and try and put in place measures to stop this. Mentally I can be strong but I am no where near cognitively where I need to be. Felt like a smoker trapped in an ex-smokers body. Not an ex-smoker just yet but if I can do what I need to do and find the foods and thoughts and behaviours that can help them I'm gonna start this evening. Won't lie in my own self pity. And for you guys and girls ex or not it's great to be around people why try and succeed.

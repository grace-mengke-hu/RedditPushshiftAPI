Everything that could go wrong did go wrong.

Today was a tough day. A long day at work fraught with arguments with clients and errors with computers. This was followed by my car breaking down on the long commute home. 

After getting home, I accidentally tripped and knocked over a shelf containing some prized collectible glassware, smashing a few of them. These belonged to my late uncle and were of great sentimental value to me, so of course this devastated me. 

But I didn’t cave. Every ounce of my being was screaming at me to make the trek down the street to 7/11. But I didn’t. And I’m going to take that as a victory. 

Just had to get that off my chest. Tomorrow is day 4. Wish me luck.

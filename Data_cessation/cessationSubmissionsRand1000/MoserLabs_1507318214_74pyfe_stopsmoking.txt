Whelp. I did it.

Made it a thousand days.  My wife and I quit about 2 and a half years ago.  It took me a bit longer than she took, but settled on the fact that I need to quit for health and expensive reasons.

Every day I remember that I am one cigarette away from a pack a day habit.  Trust me, it gets easier with time.

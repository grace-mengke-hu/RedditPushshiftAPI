39 days and I still feel hungry... practically all the time. What gives and when does this stop?

Edit: Figured out that nicotine had been suppressing some of my hypothyroid symptoms. So I changed my dosage and we'll see if that helps. Thanks ladies and gents :) 

Edit #2: I also took a bag of butter lettuce to work with me and munched on that. That helped and didn't rack up my carb intake.

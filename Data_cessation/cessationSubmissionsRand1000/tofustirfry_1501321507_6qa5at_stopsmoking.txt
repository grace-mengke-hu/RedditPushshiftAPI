Day 17: 1 mile, Chest/Back/Abs Lift, No smokes, No drinks

20 minutes until midnight and walking home after I hit my mile run. Beautiful night with thousands of stars above me. Today was a great day of accomplishments which had sat for months/years undone. Found a new restaurant near me which was nice:-) looking to buy a good road bike on Craigslist. Used to do 100 mile bike rides and need to get back into it even if I start very small. Baby steps. It's the nice thing about looking at quitting forever instead of just taking a break: I feel no rush to immediately get back to my peak state - I have time and will get there if I keep trying and go slow so no injury happens.  

Anyone else run/lift/bike or swim today?  Enjoy your night or morning:-) Thanks for being here for me to journal - really has been incredible especially since I never really write my thoughts down.

Night night world. I will not smoke or drink with you

Why do you want to stop??? List/game

I'm 28 days in now and I know from past experience being overconfident and cocky and be my biggest downfall at this stage. I forget why I wanted to quit in the first place.

So in the hope of help both myself and any others struggling with remembering why we choose to quit, why not work together with a list. 

Rule are post one reason each and try and not repeat a reason from another reply.

Hopefully, I get a reply and people don't think this ideas lame

Third week has been difficult, but I've managed to keep my quit!

Whew. Whoever said week 3 was hard wasn't kidding. 

Wow.

The challenge was purely psychological, but it was wickedly persistent, and my mouth actually physically watered at several different points this week during heavy cravings.  I made it through it all and tomorrow I will wake up to day 27 smoke free, but there was a day this past week that rivaled day three in terms of difficulty for me.  
I cried and I got pissed, but the difference between week 1 me and week 3 me???  My ability to cope has improved dramatically. I know it's all a bullshit mind game that my addiction is playing with me, but just thinking about how strong a hold it has on me and how profoundly it makes me *feel* when I have a craving, it makes me infuriated.

I laced up my shoes, and even though it was pouring rain....I ran. I ran and ran and ran. 15 miles. I listened to music and ran in the pouring rain. I didn't smoke.  I haven't had a craving since then, and that was three days ago.

I started walking the day I quit, and it turned to jogging, which turned to running....exercise is an INCREDIBLE coping method for the woes that accompany a quit. 

It was a rough week for reasons other than my nicotine addiction drama.  Work was insane, my personal life has been a little insane.  I'm so glad to be sitting here at nearly 11 pm on Saturday sipping some scotch, writing this post.  It's the first time I've been able to log in for a few days...hope everyone is hanging on and doing well!!!!!

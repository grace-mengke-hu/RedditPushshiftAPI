1 Week of Freedom

Today is my 1 week milestone. So much easier than I expected. I knew this week would be stressful because where I work we had a new store opening and I knew we would be busy!  

Every time I think about lighting one I can't imagine why I would! It made me feel worse than how I do now as a non smoker. 

I was a 20-25 a day smoker. I didn't think that was bad until I started talking to my coworkers who smoke as well and found out they smoke 10-15. Makes me sad because if I can quit I know they could quit. It's not as hard as your brain makes it out to be!

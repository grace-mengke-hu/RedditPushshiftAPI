Some tips that helped me shatter my previous record of 11 days clean

I won't ever claim to be good at quitting, especially since this current run of not-cigarettes is my 6th attempt, but I had a breakthrough and figured it couldn't hurt to put some advice out there.


**1) You need to find a reason to quit.** - Motivation is the first, and most important, step. And it needs to come from you. If you quit just because people say "hey dude, that's bad for you", it ain't gonna stick. We have all realized how dangerous of a hobby smoking is, and I think it's a safe assumption that we've all found a reason to quit. For me, it was the constant throat/chest infections leading to chest x-rays because "it could be emphysema." So terror is a powerful motivator. But you need to quit for yourself.



**2) Don't turn the task into a mountain** - When I was a kid, I was way in to wrestling. Specifically Eddie Guerrero, who I thought was the bee's knees. I watched his documentery movie, where he talked about getting through his drug/alcohol addictions. If I remember  goodly, the words he used were "If I say I'm going to quit for the rest of my life, that seems like an impossible mountain to climb. But if I say I'm not going to drink today, that I can manage." And that's the attitude that saved me, and I know can help you too. Forget that you don't want to smoke for the rest of your life. You don't want to smoke at all today. And when you wake up tomorrow, you won't want to smoke all day again. Don't look at the future in 10,20,50 years from now. Look at the next 24 hours. Stay clean, 24 hours at a time, and let the years happen on their own.



**3) There is no 'trying' it again** - This may be a moot point, since I'm probably one of the dumber people to be on the internet, but I slipped up so many times because of the thought process of "oh, it's been X days, I can have one without slipping." Wrong. Addictions are sneaky cunts, and they'll get you whenever you can. I've had friends who quit for 5 or 6 years, had a smoke at a party and inside of a week they were back on a pack-a-day diet. This is probably something that differs between each person, but just be careful that you don't put yourself in that trap.


That's all I got. The first few days and weeks are always going to be rough. But it's never too long before you start to feel better. So be a quitter!

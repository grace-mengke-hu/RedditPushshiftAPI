Always be vigilant

118 days in, haven't had a craving in a while. Maybe a week, maybe a month. It's been so low on my radar I have forgotten about it, and that's when it hit.

I started rationalizing. It's one smoke, I'm not an addict anymore blah blah blah. 

Of course I'm an addict, that's why i immediately started rationalizing it.

Never let your guard down.

Another day 1. (rage)

So, I waited all morning to decide whether or not I was ready to commit enough to reset my badge. 

This is actually my third quit. The first two were easy comparatively speaking. I just put them down and made mental notes of all my reasons to quit whenever I felt the urge. This time, I'm struggling. I think that it's stemming 100% from unresolved anger. 

I've never been an angry person. I don't have any skills for coping with anger. I just want to numb it back in whatever way I can. Recently, that's been cigarettes. 

In February, I found out my partner had been having an affair last year. I've since gone through a roller coaster of emotions that eventually led to me wanting to try to work it out with counseling, and smoking half a pack a day to avoid dealing with the anger. 

It's a bit of an overshare, but I suppose I need to give enough of my backstory to know what type of help to ask for. I'm in the middle of moving two states (in a week), and can't get into a counselor until the move is done, but I rage so bad, I want anger management. 

I will end this rant with a question, I suppose: What are your strategies for coping with anger? What helps you simmer down or work through it? I'm open to any and all suggestions.

The hard part is over?

Okay guys, so I made it to 84 hours without a single cigarette! I've read in multiple places that it gets significantly easier after 72 hours and I just wanted to know if it was true. It's been easier everyday already but there are still cravings sometimes. I'm so glad I've made it this far and I couldn't have done it without all your support and stories.it feels great to know I'm going to be able to do this and I'm 100% confident I'm going to beat this. I've already saved myself from over 80 cigarettes!! That is insane to think about and I've already saved what like 30$? I just wanted to share my success with you guys since you're the ones who got me here :)

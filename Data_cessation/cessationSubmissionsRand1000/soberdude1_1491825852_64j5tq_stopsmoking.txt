1600

Grateful!!! After a 40 year, pack and a half a day habit, knowing in my heart I was going to die a smoker, today I can celebrate 1600 days totally cigarette and nicotine free. Tried and failed every possible method of quitting. On the advise of my son, I read Allen Carr's book,"The Easy Way To Stop Smoking" and quit like I turned off a switch. Somehow I was just done smoking. Never going back. 

Quitting is possible. And it was easier than I ever imagined.

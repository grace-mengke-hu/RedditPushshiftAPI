It has been one hell of a year.

I can finally say that I've quit smoking for good. No more waking up feeling like crap everyday. No more struggling to walk up stairs. No more struggling to keep up with people while walking down the street. The ability to taste again. The ability to smell again. The ability to live my live addiction free. I"ve stopped worrying and checking my pockets every time I leave the house. I've started to enjoy life without smoking. Enjoying the added time to my day. The added years to my life. 

It wasn't easy for me. In fact it was quite hard. for the first couple of months i screamed and yelled and got angry for no reason. I gained some weight because I ate my way out of smoking. But after three or four months i started taking everything with stride. It clicked. I struggled with drinking and smoking and eventually i got over it. It is nothing for me anymore. 

I could not have done this without this sub. Seriously. people ask me how i quit and i say reddit. I know it sounds crazy but having a community of people who know exactly what I was/am going through to be able to ask questions of and come to for support really helped me out. I did use the patch to quit smoking as well.

Congrats to all those quitting. I have reached something that many people never believed i would quit and sometimes myself i never thought i could go a year without it. 

Im going to keep on quitting and celebrating the fact i am a non smoker!

EDIT: if anyone has questions ill be happy to answer them!

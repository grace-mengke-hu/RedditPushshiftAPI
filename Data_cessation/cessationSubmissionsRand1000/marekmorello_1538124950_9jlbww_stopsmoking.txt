1500 days

1500 days ago, I made one of the best decisions in my life. I regret nothing. 

If you're struggling, let me tell you, it gets easier. Hang in there and focus on not smoking TODAY. Tomorrow, it will be a tiny bit easier. One step at a time. You will never be completely safe from relapsing, but the thought that you used to smoke, will get more and more absurd.
You can do it.

Peace.

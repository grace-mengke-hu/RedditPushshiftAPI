Day 5, mostly get urges when bored.

I'm on break from school at the moment so I'm kinda just moping around the house. Was a pack every 2 days guy, recently upped it to a pack a day. Weirdly enough I haven't really had much withdrawals, but then again I don't work full time or have many responsibilities so that's probably why.

Just wondering if anyone is the same as me, and gets urges when bored and nothing to do. I want to fill in the void but I don't really have any hobbies.

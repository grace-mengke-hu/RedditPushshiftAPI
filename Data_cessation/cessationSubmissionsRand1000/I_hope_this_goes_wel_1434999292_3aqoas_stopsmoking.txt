I've been thinking differently lately

I First off, I just wanted to see my star again.

I don't crave anything anymore. I can go into bars that are filled with smoke while drunk and still not have any cravings. I even had to hold my friend's cigg for him the other day - nothing. However I am now starting to think about how much I miss it. I've read Allen Carr's  book about four times and I remember the part where he says you shouldn't feel jealous of the smokers. But that's what I'm starting to notice about myself. I'll see someone go out for a smoke break at work and just think "hmmm kinda wish I could do that." I honestly hate this feeling so much because I feel like there is still that potential I could smoke again. Should I read the book again? Should I watch his two hour movie? Will this feeling pass (it's been going on for about two-three weeks now)?

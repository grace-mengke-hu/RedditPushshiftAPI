Two Months: "Oh, was I a smoker?"

Was I ever a smoker? 

I don’t relate anymore when I see a smoker walking in front of me. I don’t think “oh, that used to be me, I remember that sweet taste.” I don’t remember that; it seems so long ago. And I could give a fuck about it.

I’ve lost a bunch of weight, I walk 25k+ a week, I don’t smell like shit anymore (besides after said walks), stray ashes don’t cover my tables and chairs, and I’m not constantly running to the 7-11 to grab smokes at 2AM . 

I can’t tell you when this transition happened, when I stopped even giving an ounce of my consciousness. In full disclosure, I had quit smoking for four months, succumed for 6 weeks, and have now been quit for another two months. What that means and why; I don’t know, but I’m quite aware that we’re never fully cured, just currently a non smoker.

Still, my addiction to nicotine currently resides on the bottom of my running shoe next to the road grime it is. I’m going to keep scraping it’s corpse against the pavement as I walk further away from the smokers life I left behind. Keep at it friends, and you’ll be there too.

Put the fucking cigarette down right now and get here.

Peace.

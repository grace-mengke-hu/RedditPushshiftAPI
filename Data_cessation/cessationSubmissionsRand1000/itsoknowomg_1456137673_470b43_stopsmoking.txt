14days.

It seems like im addicted to reading stopsmoking/nofap, because i do it everyday and i just cant stop it. 

I remember though it stops later on when you get like 2-4 months, maybe sooner, but this is one of the best daily reminders. 

By the way guys, do you celebrate when you hit a milestone like one month for example ? I didnt do this yet so im wondering in what way it is good to celebrate ? How do you celebrate ?

anyways, thanks for support and stay free

Smokers in movies and on TV....ugh

I watch a lot of historical TV dramas and British TV.  Last night I was watching Call the Midwife and I got so annoyed by all the smoking!  I honestly don't mind it when it's part of a character or part of the plot (like the lovely episode where Dr. Turner sees a cancerous lung for the first time and decides to quit smoking) but often the actor is taking a solitary puff and then just holds the damn thing.  Like...what was the damn point?  I know that there's a drive to be historically accurate, and smoking was a very prevalent part of society in years past.  I really just hate seeing it now, even when it's on TV.  Does anyone else feel this way?

To everyone planning to quit for New Years

Stop today. Stop today and never look back. 

I successfully quit three years ago today as "practice" for quitting on New Years. If you think it will be hard or that you need cigarettes I will recommend what changed everything for me. It isn't about quitting. If you stop smoking you are not losing a crutch that helps you relax, not losing a tool for focus, not losing a source of enjoyment after a meal, and not losing a social prop. You are gaining your freedom from an accursed death-stick that never helped you or gave you pleasure in the first place. 

My recommendation is to completely change how you see cigarettes. 

Recommendation: **Pick up and read Allen Carr's Easyway to Stop Smoking.** 

Pick it up from the library, bookstore, audible, or check it out from a virtual library on OverDrive Media. I don't care how you get it, just get it. Give yourself an amazing start to the new years and be free to enjoy life more than ever.

About to hit the 48 hours!

and i'm feeling dog poo. Irritable and i can't concentrate! I finished Allen Carrs book too and I must say, it has helped because I definitely don't want a cig and I now know that I never will! but christ, I am in a mood, trying to be positive, but I actually feel like I want an argument with someone haha! one last thing, anyone thinking about quitting please man up and just go cold turkey! I know its hard, but all you need to do is get rid of nicotine, i'd hate to be on NRT for months and then have to go through what I am then! much easier just to get it out the way

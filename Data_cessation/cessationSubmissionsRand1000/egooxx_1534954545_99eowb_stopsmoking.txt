i really need a "shh, that's normal, everything's okay"-comment right now

hey guys, 
i'm working out, i mean, i'm literally working out right now, but i needed to take a 2min break because my lungs hurt so much. i worked out regularly this year but stopped 2 months ago, so i'm not in peak form. in addition, i've eaten the whole supermarket shelf with sweets and crisps when i quit smoking 3 weeks ago so yeah, it's understandable that working out is a little unpleasant. 

but honestly. i've only done 20minutes of veeeeryyyyy light cardio and still my lungs are literally HURTING because of all the air that i suddenly feel. it's hard to describe. it feels like my lungs can't bear all the fresh air anymore. i always read how great breathing feels when you quit but i don't know, it hurts. it burns. 
is this normal ??? i've been smoking for 10 years and i'm 24, so i guess my lungs maybe don't remember what air actually is but will this go away? 

i also got a very bad runny nose. that appeared one month before i quit and has gotten much worse since. my nose is stuffy all the time and i sneeze 40 times a day on average. 

so.... how long does this take to heal? should i go see a doctor? 
maaaan i want to work out again but in this shape, i'm not capable of doing more than some yoga -.-

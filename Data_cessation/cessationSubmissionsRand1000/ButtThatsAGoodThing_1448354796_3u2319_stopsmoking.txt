No more cigarettes! No more wasting money, time, health!

I've usually been the stereotype couch potato, I am 1,79m (5'9") and did weigh 60KG...
but 2 months ago i started doing a lot of sports, I started doing MMA, drinking protein shakes and generally increased my workout to get more energy during the day.
I really notice that Smoking is a killer during sports! Yesterday i did run 10KM and by the end i was spitting green gooey stuff. (Just a friendly reminder to my self what was happening inside my lungs....)

I've been smoking for nearly 5 years now (Holy shit, i never actually realized this...) with up and down from 0.8 to 1.5 packs a day. 
In this time i've stopped smoking twice for 2 monts and twice i've given up... 

NOT THIS TIME! I smoked my last cigarette 3 hours ago and I AM DONE! Keep positive! 
-Health 
-Hygiene 
-Money 
-Time spend efficiency (I want to become successful in my job More than any of my colleagues! I will need to make the most out of all the time i have!)

I'd like to thank everyone who has posted their support on this sub-reddit!
And also I want to wish all the luck in the whole world to the people around me that are going through the same thing!

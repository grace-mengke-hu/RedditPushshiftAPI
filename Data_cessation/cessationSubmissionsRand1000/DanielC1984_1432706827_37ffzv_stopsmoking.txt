Quitting whilst partner smokes

Anybody have any advice about dealing with second hand smoke from partners. Keep waking up feeling like I have been smoking even though I haven't and go through the feelings of withdrawal again. It's getting to be annoying now as he keeps stopping and starting. Even though he smokes outside. I'm not going to smoke but it's starting to get me angry. He smells like an ashtray and I no that I probably did too three months ago but it feels like the ashtray is being rubbed in my face.

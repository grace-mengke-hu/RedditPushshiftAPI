Still here...still smoke free...and I got thru a really bad week.

It's pretty cool actually - if I could get thru this horrible week...and especially thru Wed (and boy was I constantly tempted with the "fuck it"s Wed late afternoon/evening)...then that means I can handle most of my stresses. It's not easy...but now I know I already did it.

Thanks for being here!  Y'all really helped me stick it out.

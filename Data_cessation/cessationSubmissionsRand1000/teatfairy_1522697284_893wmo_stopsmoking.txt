Just celebrated 2 weeks!

Holy shit, I seriously never even fathomed I would go one day without craving cigarettes. I still get tiny pangs of cravings but they go away really easily. And omfg they smell so bad.. I can't believe I walked around smelling that way for 14 years. Its weird discovering all the things I can smell and taste now.

I am so damned proud. I plan to get a gym membership now I that I can actually do something without wheezing. Thank you, ever improving lung capacity!

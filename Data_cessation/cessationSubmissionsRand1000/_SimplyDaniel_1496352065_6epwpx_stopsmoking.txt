Three Days In

Monday May 29th at 9:30am and smoked a cigarette consciously, every breath of smoke I inhaled I felt my lungs hurt. I closed my eyes every inhale to fully feel how my body felt. I've been waiting to quit for the past year or so and honestly, I had given up because I kept on making excuses and going back. But, as I smoked that cigarette consciously I realized that it's doing absolutely nothing for me other than killing me quicker and making me smell horrid. I had 15 left in my pack and threw them away I feel certain about this quit. I smelt the freedom of being smoke free at 9:35 am that day. To those trying to quit I know I'm only three days in but smoke that cigarette consciously and fully observe yourself. 

Three days in and my anxiety levels have decreased A LOT. I feel  a lot more clear headed, more focused and overall happier. We can do it guys!! Let's change our lives for the better!

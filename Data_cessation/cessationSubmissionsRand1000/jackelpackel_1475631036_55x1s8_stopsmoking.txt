Dealing with bad anxiety

On my one month of not smoking I kinda smoked a little bit of a cigarette, but since then I haven't picked up another one.

But due to my awful depression and bad anxiety that gets to the point that I'm actually making myself sick. I am fighting the urge not to drive to the store and buy a pack. So far I'm doing good, but on the other hand I'm afraid I might slip.

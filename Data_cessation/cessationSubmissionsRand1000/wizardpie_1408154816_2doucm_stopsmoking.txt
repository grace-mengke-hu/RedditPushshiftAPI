Quitting again...

I have been smoking since i was 17 years old, i am 25 now. I have quit for 55 days at one point in my life but i always justified my way back into it. I recently made an attempt about 3 weeks ago, i quit for 9 days cold turkey, i was about to turn 25 and i wanted to start over... I have a few drinks with freinds for my birthday, and lo and behold i have a ciggarette in my mouth. I smoked my last cigarette in my pack today. I dont want to do this to myself anymore, i just want to skip the first week of quitting again, i work with smokers, i live with smokers, wish me luck!

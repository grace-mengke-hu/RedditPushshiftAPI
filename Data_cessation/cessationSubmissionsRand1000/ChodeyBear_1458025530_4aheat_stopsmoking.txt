I smoked, after close to 2 years

So things have been getting on top of me lately. Tons of stress. Smoking has crossed my mind lots lately and yesterday I went for it. I essentially am in a bit of a 'fuck it, I don't care if I die young' mood. 

What I do know is that the cigarette didn't particularly make the situation better, but it did seem to slow things down. 

I spent the evening with a bloody awful headache. 

I'm in 2 minds as to what's going to happen now. I was reluctant to post this as I'm not sure I want people to tell me to get back on the horse. I feel like I owe it to this sub to tell you what's happened.

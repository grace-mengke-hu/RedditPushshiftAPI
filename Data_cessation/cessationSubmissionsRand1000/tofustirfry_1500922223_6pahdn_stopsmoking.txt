Day 13: No smokes, No drinks, Yes weight lifting

Just opened my eyes to day 13 - one away from two weeks! Officially the longest I've been without a cigarette or nicotine since I started back smoking two and half years ago. A few people smoked near or around me last night - enjoyed the smell - lingered on the thought of enjoying one - moved on with my life. It wasn't an addictive craving where all of a sudden I needed one - more like missing an old friend who had passed away 13 days ago.

Got my fifth day in a row of solid 2 hour weight lifting in. Finally remember to take a before pic to understand the sense of progress that will be happening at the 30/60/90 day marks of stop smoking and stop drinking.

I know I keep saying this, but holy fuck does the world smell! Good and bad but so intense - it's like I've been blind and can now see. Truly remarkable.

Off on a backpack trek. Today I will not smoke with you all!

Starting Day 2

So yesterday was he first time in a very long time that I didn't have at least one cigarette. There have been many days where I don't smoke, but i would always find a way to have that smoke right before bed. I had some trouble falling asleep right away yesterday but I have woken up today refreshed. Yes, I am thinking about having a smoke, but I am also thinking about how it's just the addiction talking. I just poured another cup of coffee rather than going out for my routine morning ciggy.

Everyone has different motivations for quitting. Other than the obvious (my health), I'm trying to create a healthier, fitter lifestyle and smoking doesn't fit in anymore. I'm also an incredibly lonely person. I used to smoke when I saw other smokers, thinking maybe I could fit in somewhere, you know? But, as I should have seen, smoking doesn't make me a better person or friend. 

I am on a path towards self-improvement. It's taken me a few months to whittle down my bad habit, and I know there's months more of work to do. But this is one of the first mornings that I actually thought I can be the better person--physically and mentally--that I am desperate to be. Maybe, just maybe, someone will notice.

If you've read this far, thank you. I just wanted to share some insights. Stay strong!

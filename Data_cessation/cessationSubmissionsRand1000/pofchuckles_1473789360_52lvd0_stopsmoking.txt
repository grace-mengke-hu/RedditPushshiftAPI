Quitting smoking and Diabetes

I read online that a womens risk of developing diabetes returns to normal after a year of quitting. I have been trying to research for a long time to find out what a mans risk is. All I can find though is articles saying about how your risk of diabetes goes up of you first quit and of course web md saying it takes 10 years and infact for 3 years your risk goes up. How can you risk of anthing go up and not down after stopping smokig? This seems wrong to me. Can anyone  please give me a link or information on how long it takes of diabetes risk in men to return to normal as I can find one.

Thanks

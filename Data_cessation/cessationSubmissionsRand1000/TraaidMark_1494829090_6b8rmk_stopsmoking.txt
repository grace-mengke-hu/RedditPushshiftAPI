Day 0 - I need to be honest with myself.

2 years ago I managed to quit for a while. Since then, I have been quitting almost every day. I have come on here and I grabbed my badge only to have to remove it again a few hours later. The app that I have has been reset so many times, I might as well just delete it.

But doing that would mean that I am giving up on quitting, giving up on my dream to be a non-smoker, giving up on me. So I haven't deleted the app.

So the problem isn't the cigarettes. It's all me. I lack the discipline to suffer even the slightest, and the motivation to just get through that one craving. I hate that I smoke, I despise it, but if I simply blink I'm standing outside with a smoke in my hand wondering wtf just happened.

So then this post is my accountability. I will get my badge, and reset my app again. I will make a post here every single day for the next 30 days. I will do my best, and do my best without stupid excuses.

I haven't smoked a cigarette since 06h45 this morning, and I managed to get through 2 cups of coffee at work without a single smoke. 

If I smoke today I'm not only letting myself down, I am also letting you guys down. You guys are always helpful, you are always fighting the fight and suffering the pain and getting through it. You are doing it, and I want to be in your club rather in my shitty one, so I will do my best to prove my worth here.

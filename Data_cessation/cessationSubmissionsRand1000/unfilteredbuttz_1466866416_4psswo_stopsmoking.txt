Not Smoking and Hangovers.

I stopped smoking over 4 months ago. The first 30 days I did not drink. i notice I no longer get hangovers when I go out drinking.  I did realize that when I smoked and drank together a large part of my hangover was a smoking hangover.  Now I'm able to shake a hangover off in an hour. Not necessarily seeing this as a bonus though as it hangovers definitely kept overdoing it in check. Anyone else experience this?

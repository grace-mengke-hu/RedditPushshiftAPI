When some of your "still smoking" friends are desperate to see you fail :-(

I am on 550 hours so far, its not alot, but I am feeling very positive and determined that this is now my life change, what I find so annoying though is I have 1 or two friends that have spend thousands on trying to quit, using every program or gadget that is out there, only to start smoking shortly after..     These same friends almost seem adament to see me fail, because they also know me so well, they know my triggers, so they will constantly try and get me to "have that drink"  or   "have that one smoke" Almost as though it will make them feel better ..  I decided to quit cold turkey, have never spent a cent on trying to quit, but also believe that you really need to want to quit, and I think that no matter how much money you spend on trying to kick the habit, it can only work if you commit to it mentally.   
My choices now are that for the time being, I am rather spending more time with the supportive friends, even the ones that smoke, I think its important to have that support from the ones you hold nearest to you during the beginning phases, and the ones that don't support need to take a back seat for a while till they get over themselves...

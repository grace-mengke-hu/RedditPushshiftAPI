Today one year ago I made my choice

I has been exactly one year since I once again decided to quit. Since that moment I haven't had a single cigarette. It was was easier than I expected. I guess what really was at the basis of completing this one year is that I took the decision on my own, with no pressure and without doing it for someone else. I believe this is the way to do it. You can make it too when you really do it for yourself.  
  
This subreddit has been through the year. I've jointly shortly after I decided to quit and everyone heer has been supportive all the time. Seeing so many people fighting smoking is just inspirational and the fact that so many of you have succeeded made me confident that I can do it too. Cheers.

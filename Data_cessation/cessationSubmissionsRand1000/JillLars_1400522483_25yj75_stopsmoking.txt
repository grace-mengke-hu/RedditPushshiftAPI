Spent a bunch of money this weekend

I decided on a whim to take my family to a Twins game yesterday at Target Field.  I bought 4 tickets and brought my 2 boys along.  The kids had never been to a game before and of course wanted to try everything- nachos, pretzels, hot dogs, cotton candy, etc.  When we were done my husband and I thought- ouch, we just spent a ton of money on this excursion.  I checked in with my smoking ap later in the evening and noticed that I've saved $444.00 in the last 2 months of not being a smoker.  That more than paid for our Sunday baseball excursion!  It's amazing to think of how many more fun things we'll be able to do when I'm not throwing away 50 bucks a week on smokes.

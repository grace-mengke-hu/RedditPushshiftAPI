I slipped

I slipped, not once or twice but thrice in a day.
I have been completely smoke free for 7 months now. Have had many drinks in between but never touched that awful death stick. Dont know what happened today. Had few drinks and took three consecutive cigarettes. As though what I went through to quit didn't matter at all.
Now I am afraid. Is the dark side taking over again?
Can't afford to let it. I am obese and diabetic. Most probably have few ailments right around the corner. I quit just because of that. Now I don't even know what happened.
What happened?

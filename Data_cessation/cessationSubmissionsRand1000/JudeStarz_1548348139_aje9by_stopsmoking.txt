Smoke free for 7 days! It's not a lot but I am so very happy!

After 4 relapses these past two and a half weeks, I still can't believe it. I was at work when my stop smoking app reminded me to be proud of my achievment. 

I struggled so much on day 3 and 4, I didn't know how I would continue, while entertaining thoughts of surrendering (yet again). 

I am just so thankful for this day. Thank you thank you thank you!!! 🙆‍♀️

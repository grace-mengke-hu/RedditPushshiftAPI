Mild pain in the chest after dreaming of smoking

Hello guys, so I quit 24 days ago after about a year of smoking. It's going pretty good so far, I'm just having mild cravings in stressful situations.

But one strange thing I have noticed is, I dreamed of smoking 3 times since I quit, the most recent one was yesterday and every time this happened, I woke with a slight pain in my chest, as if I have smoked a cigarette after a long time. I have no problem breathing though.

I thought I was sleepwalking (and smoking during that time) or something like that but I asked my roommates about it and they told me that I'm not. I also remember that every time I smoke in my dreams, I am in a stressful environment (in my dream).

Any thoughts on what this could be? Is it just my lungs recovering after 24 days or something?

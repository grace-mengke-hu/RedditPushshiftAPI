The Third Day... sheesh...

Any insights on the third day and why the cravings are coming like machine gun fire?  I woke up, felt great and even told my wife that I felt like momentum is on my side.  A few hours later and I'm entering my third craving into the app on my phone - beating day one by this time of day.

I'm lucky enough to find this comical - at least at this point - because I've been in such a good mood about quitting so far (which has really helped overall, I would say) - but what gives?!?!?  Is this the reaction to the last little bit of physical nicotine leaving my body?  Is the whole day like this, or just a little after the 48 hour mark?

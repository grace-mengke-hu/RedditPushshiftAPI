30 DAYS!

Sooo... I got here, wow. I simply can not describe how accomplished and happy I feel. I am happy for not being a loser. I'm young, I'm almost 19 and I have been smoking for 3 years. I assume quitting as soon as possible in your life is for the best. One thing I noticed is that I have been sleeping really badly in the last while. Is quitting smoking the reason?

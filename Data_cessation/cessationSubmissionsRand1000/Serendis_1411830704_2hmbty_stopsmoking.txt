Uninhibited SNUGGLE!

Having a bad craving (bad argument).  I'm going to write this down and by the time I'm done, I'll be fine....

Both of my kids (10 and 7) came downstairs this morning all groggy eyed from a good nights sleep...I was in my recliner watching DIY shows on HGTV while drinking my morning coffee. Both of them crawled under my blankets and into my lap, snuggled close into my chest and settled in, my hair surrounding them...breathing deeply. 

I sat there and a massive wave of happiness rushed over me.

Before, I would have immediately tensed up and attempted to try not to breathe in their direction, pull my hair away from them and worry about the smell....this morning....I sat with my kids, huge smile on my face, held them so tight with NO anxiety at all.  I just enjoyed them, and enjoyed the moment. The moment that lasted so much longer than it would have before....because I wasn't stressed out, trying to get to the mouthwash, or the next cigarette.

Not smoking has taken SO much anxiety out of my life.

Quitting made me feel more anxious the first few days, but oh my goodness....the anxiety level of my day to day life is AT LEAST half of what it was before.

Incredible!

I'm going to go poach some more snuggles now....because I can! ;)

I feel better now!

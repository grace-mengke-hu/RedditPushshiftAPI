Day 5 and quitting alcohol

The European football championships start today. I am in Bc do For the next month I work from 2pm onwards and I get to watch every game and then go to work which I think is an awesome distraction! Anyway in the past between 2010-2014 I "quit" smoking about 20 times. I used to have a very social life and all 20 of those times I failed the moment I touched alcohol. Most of the time it was quit on a Monday drink Friday/ Saturday so I'd fail day 5 or 6 a few times day 8-16 I'd fail and 3 times day 19-25. I drink a lot less now. In fact I've had two nights of drinking since April 1st. I've never enjoyed drinking as much as everyone else so If needs be I am prepared to give that up forever to. Is there anyone else who quit drinking and smoking? Or failed dozens of time once a drink hit on the weekend?

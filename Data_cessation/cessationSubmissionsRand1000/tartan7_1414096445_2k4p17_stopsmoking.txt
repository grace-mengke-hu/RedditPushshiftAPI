Does the urge to smoke ever completely go away?

Does the urge to smoke ever completely go away? With the help of nicotine patches I find that I don't think about smoking throughout the day (which is awesome) but occasionally I will smell a cigarette and think it smells really good and want one (but not unbearably so).

Almost 2 weeks. Still sucks. Getting better.

13 days without cigarettes. 3 days without cigarettes or nicotine lozenges. 

I'm still feeling cravings occasionally,  but they are less frequent and less intense than I would have predicted. Tomorrow is a work day, so the stress from that could be challenging for me. 

I'm not going to smoke, though. I've made it too far now. Soon I will be able to say that I've gone all day without even thinking about a cigarette and that will make it all worth it.

What would happen if I had just one...?

I'm using the Cessation Nation app to track my stats as I quit, and one of the great things about it is that it shows the health benefits in terms of percentages. For example, right now it shows that the nicotine has left my body 100% and dependence on nicotine is 29% gone.

My question is that if I were to lapse and have just one cigarette, would this immediately undo all my hard work. Would I be starting again from 0?

Two months!

My biggest worry was that I'd think about smoking for the rest of my life. Well, I do still think about it but not nearly as much as I thought about it while I was smoking. "Do I have enough cigarettes to get me through the rest of the day? How long until I get a break from work so I can go outside and smoke? I'm almost done with this cigarette, should I light another since I don't know when the next time I'll be able to will be?"

It's much better now. I get urges but it's more like when you think about what you wish you'd said to that jerk that one time. It bugs you, but then you move on.

Anyway, my life without cigarettes has been great. Congrats to all you other quitters out there and to all you who haven't, make the jump. You can do it and it'll be amazing.

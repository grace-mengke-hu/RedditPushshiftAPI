10 Months

Best decision I made after a 33 year habit that became a secret addiction.  It is hard to relate to that person who rushed home to refuel her nicotine addiction in seclusion.  I am not going to lie, I still think about smoking and miss the nicotine sensation.  But with so much more clarity, I know how much it robbed me, financially, mentally, emotionally and physically.  Nothing good came from it.  And like Golem, I sickly yearn for it, sometimes, but with a weaker and weaker craving sensation..  I am a non smoker.  I kicked it.  And I am never going back to it again.  10 Months!

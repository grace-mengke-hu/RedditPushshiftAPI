Anyone else getting offered cigarettes a lot and being told he will relapse?

Hello,

I live in a country with +50% smoking rate. Pretty much everyone I know smokes including my parents. Quitting smoking is something that rarely happens successfully here. As in I only know one person who successfully quit smoking and he did it by leaving the country.

Anyway, that's besides the point. I'm 10 days off after 5 years of smoking 1 pack a day. And a common reaction with my friends upon being told is to smirk and offer me a cigarette. Of course I laugh it off and reject. Some even persist. Telling me a variation of "meh, you'll relapse eventually anyway, might as well do it now".

I know that you'll tell me to get other friends but we all know that's not how life works. I just laugh it off and come back with something like "Don't assume everyone is as weak willed as you" and smirk back. Of course there are very supportive friends, some that even stopped smoking in-front of me which I really appreciate. And there is this one friend who put off his cigarette the moment i told him I quit and few days later told me he is quitting with me. Also my family is very supportive. But those people are the exception not the majority.

It's really getting annoying. I didn't relapse yet and if I were to relapse it won't be because of these situations because they really make my blood boil. If anything this is making me more determined not to relapse as everyone is pretty sure I'm relapsing eventually which sucks. But as I have a bit of a "fuck you" attitude this is having the exact opposite reaction, if that makes any sense.

Anyone else has similar experience?

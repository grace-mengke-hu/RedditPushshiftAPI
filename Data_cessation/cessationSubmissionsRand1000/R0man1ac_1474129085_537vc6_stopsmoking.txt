36 hours in.

Well I'm gonna do it this time. 

Posted yesterday after 24 hours. It seems so mediocre considering previous attempts to quit. My longest attempt was over a year. My shortest was a few hours. 

I've been a serial quitter for about four years. I know I can do it, because I've done it before. I know I can break the addiction. Because I have before. 

The hardest part for me isn't the actual quitting. It's the actual staying quit. Even after quitting for over a year I always had that nagging in the back of my head. 

Your stressed. Just smoke one. You'll never go back to being a full fledged smoker. And I was fooled each time. 

I've tried quitting in every single way I can think of. 

Nicotine replacement. 
Patches. 
Gum. 
Hookah pens with no nicotine. 
Hookah pens with a little nicotine. 
Vape pens with nicotine or no nicotine. 
Allen cars easy way (worked for a good while). 
The only thing that has ever really worked for me is cold turkey. Which is what I'm doing again. 

Posting and reading this subreddit makes the cravings go away. Thanks guys.

Week 1 down!

The weekend was my biggest challenge yet having to DJ and be in a club atmosphere for the night. There’s smoking everywhere! I survived by substituting cigarettes for lollipops 🍭, sheer determination and the knowledge that there are non smokers out there who don’t even know this struggle and I want to join them!!! Honestly, had a great night. Was more engaged in the present and with those around me as I wasn’t always thinking about Ky next opportunity to smoke. It simply wasn’t an option so I could stay focused on where I was! Stoked!

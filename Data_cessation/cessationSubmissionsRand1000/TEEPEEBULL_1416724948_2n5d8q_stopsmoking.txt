This sub is called Stopsmoking. So all forms of NRT are OK to post?

Since the intent here is to kick the habit (am I showing my old skool underwear? Im 52,)

Are all NRT legitimate methods OK to post? The sub is callled " Stopsmoking"" right? So that seems the only criteria. (Mods?)

Lemme speak to my own post...   stop smoking, to me, meant- off cigarettes- NUMERO UNO! That meant off nicotine too. Worked for me.

Anybody gets off cancer sticks ...I like it. Anyhow.

How do you get here? Go Smokeless!!That's the point of Stopsmoking subrReddit, right?

Go smokeless ?,which one? How?  What Method?  (cold turkey, chew, vape, nicorette, patch, snus, hookah, invisible fence, laser, mace, rubber bands, Nickelback CD's? )

So.... StopSmoking Cigarettes...numero Uno!!!!   Split hairs o0ver how that is accomplished- at a later date.......... step in the right direction should not be discouraged is the point I'm trying to make.

I wanna be helper, more than i wanna be a preacher.

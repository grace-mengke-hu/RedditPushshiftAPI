Quitting is easy.

Quitting is easy. If you tell yourself and believe that quitting is easy, it will be easy. If you tell yourself repeatedly how hard quitting is, then it Will be hard. 

This is working for me. I treat my quitting as an easy to do. Bonus: it reinforces my Will not to relapse, because I dont want to lose an easy battle, i wouldn't like feeling like shit because of having lost something that was easy to win.

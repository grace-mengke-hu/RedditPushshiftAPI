3 days ~18hrs

I don’t know if it’s the Champix or what, but here I am at 3 days 18 hours and my worst craving was relatively mild (3/10). 
I have had many, many opportunities to pick up a smoke since I quit but I just don’t. I don’t want to not do I care to. 
When ever I thought about it, I’ve actually just said “no” or “nope” and I’m over it. 
I haven’t felt anxious, irritable, angry, or anything. I feel lucky. 
Also, holy shit I can breathe significantly better! I wake up and don’t feel any need to cough! That makes me so much more giddy and motivates me to keep it going. I’m not giving up and not giving in.
Things are great so far:)

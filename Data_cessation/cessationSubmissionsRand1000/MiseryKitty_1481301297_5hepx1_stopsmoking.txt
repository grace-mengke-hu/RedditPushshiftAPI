Tonight it will be TWO WEEKS!!!

Two weeks just feels unreal. I never thought I would get this far again. I've been tempted far too many times while drinking but I have managed to stay clean. My coworkers also smoke but I have managed to stay away (though I have been so close.)

Today I found out my grandfather has passed away. It'll be an emotionally trying time. I hope I can keep clean. Wish me luck, quitters!

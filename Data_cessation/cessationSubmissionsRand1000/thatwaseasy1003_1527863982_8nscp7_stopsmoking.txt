Any positive quitting stories?

I’m not trying to offend, and I really like this community, but every time I stop by this board when a craving hits all I see is people on day 3 ecstatic that they’ve quit or whining from people who are months in. Anybody that has quit for a long time that gets no craving? That’s actually happy? I know you guys are out there - share your story.

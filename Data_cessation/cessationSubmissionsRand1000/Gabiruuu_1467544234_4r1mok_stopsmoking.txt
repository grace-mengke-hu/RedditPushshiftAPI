Yesterday I got so wasted drunk

Yesterday I got so wasted drunk and not for a single time I thought about smoking! 

It really gets easier with time, even in a night out, but don't let your guard go down. What I always keep in mind is that I used to love to be a smoker; but I love so much more to be a non smoker! So, that's the trick. Enjoy the fact that you're a non smoker and it becomes easier everyday. ðŸ˜‰

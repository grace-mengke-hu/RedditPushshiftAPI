Has anyone experienced getting a sinus infection?

It's been 22 days since my last cigarette but the last few nights, my lungs started feeling really heavy as if I were smoking again. Now yesterday and today I've been going through this awful sinus infection. I'm just curious if anyone has any idea whether there is some sort of correlation there.

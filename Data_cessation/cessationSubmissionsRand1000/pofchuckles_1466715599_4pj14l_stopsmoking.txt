Day 17 the struggle

Headaches, not a heavy cough but a light cough over the last 2 weeks, fatigue I mean I have never ever been this exhausted and yesterday I had my 3rd ever panic attack when playing soccer I thought I was having fun the I left went home sat there for 10 minutes then felt fine.

When does the headaches/fatigue end?

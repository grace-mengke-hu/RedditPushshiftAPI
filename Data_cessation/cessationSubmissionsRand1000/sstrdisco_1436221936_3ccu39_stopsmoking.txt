Looking forward to sight-seeing as a non smoker

Tomorrow I get to go to Detroit for a few days. I LOVE the Motor City. LOVE. The last time I was there, I still smoked. I planned a lot of what I did, and did not do, around smoking. Not this time! This time, I'm going to go where I want, when I want, stay as long as I want, and just enjoy myself. What a huge relief to not be planning my life around something that kept me from doing things. I'm really joyful about that.

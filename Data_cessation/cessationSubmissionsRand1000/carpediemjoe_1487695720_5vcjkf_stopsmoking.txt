I go to meetings four times a day.

Hi my name is Joe and I'm a nicotine addict.

This sub is my NA meeting (Nicotine Anonymous) I go to four times a day.

I check it when I wake up. At lunch. When I get home from work. And before bed.

I'm on day 114 but having read the posts on here I know how easy it is to fall back into being a pack a day smoker.

It works if you work it. Keep coming back.

I have overcome meth addiction, nicotine is even more evil than meth.

In 2001 I quit meth. It had been a hellish 2 years, but one day, after several suicide attempts, losing most of my back teeth, being covered in self harm scars, experiencing psychosis...I said to myself "No more of this". I went to bed and pretty much didn't leave it for 2 weeks. I went through hell of cravings and stuff. And I never was the person I was before meth again. I get depressed, I'm always anxious, but yeah I did it!  It's so long ago now it feels like a different life.

Now nicotine. 

Multiply the time I spent on meth by 10 and that's how long I've smoked. It's nowhere near the effect of meth, in fact it's a shitty buzz that does nothing but stop the agitated feelinh I get. 20 a day for 20 years. It's robbed me of my health much worse than meth. It's a slower more insidious process. I hate it so much, but keep failing at quitting. I want to quit more than anything. I'm going to the doctors to see if I can get champix, I've tried everything else, any advice is appreciated!

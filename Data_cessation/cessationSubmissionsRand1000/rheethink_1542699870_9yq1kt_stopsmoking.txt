$1k wager - 23 hours in

Okay. My bones ache. My chest hurts. I've had two anxiety attacks and I almost cried in the shower.

I decided to jump the gun on my $1k wager to wait smoking for one full month (no vaping allowed either). Cold. Fucking. Turkey. The bet officially starts at midnight (PST), but started 23hrs sooner. My thought process: if I can't do 24 hrs, I have no hope of completing the month.

So... It seems I can get through at least 24 hours. I want to punch a crying baby's face. I don't feel well. I hate myself for making this bet. I've made a hundred excuses about why I should be allowed to renege on this bet or lie.

But... I won't do that.

And until I can justify why smoking one cigarette is worth $2k, I guess I'll have to stay strong.

FML.

You know how I know I'm done for good this time...

I went to Vegas for four days last week, got drunk off of my ass, gambled with two of my buddies that still smoke and not one single time did I have the thought cross my mind that I was missing a single thing.
All that ever did when the smoke would come near me from anyone, was think, god, i do  not miss smelling like shit.

Having said that, I'm not stupid enough to believe anything more then this, one drag is all it would take to undo everything I have done, I will never smoke again, not because I am cured of the addiction, but because I know better and will not let myself fall int to that trap again.

And what a difference, because the last time I was there 2 years ago I was smoking at least 2 packs a day.

On the Fence

I quit smoking two years ago, and I've been off the wagon since late June.  I've been compulsively lurking this subreddit again, I guess because the urge to quit is welling up inside me again.

But to be honest, the thought of quitting depresses me.  The headaches, the cravings, the irritability, the brainfog, the slip-ups that ruin my self-esteem, my SO offering no support, the teeth-grinding, the weight gain, not knowing from minute to minute if I'm going to pick a butt off the ground and light it.  I never, EVER felt normal the entire time that I was off nicotine.  I always had this tension in the back of my head that gnawed at me and made me exhausted all the time.  

Is it really worth it?  Especially when I don't even know if I'm going to succeed this time?  Is an early death really THAT much worse than living a long life feeling like my head is in a vise?   

I'm not looking for advice or motivation per se.  Just wanted to get this off my chest mostly.  All mentions of Allan fucking Carr will get my immediate downvote.

Edit: changed "willing" to "welling"

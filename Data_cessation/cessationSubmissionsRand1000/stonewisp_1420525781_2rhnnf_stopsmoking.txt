Thoughts & Encouragement

I came here for some encouragement and to leave some as well. It's been helpful reading everyone's stories of success and even difficulties, as I'm a New Year's pledger feeling those cravings right about now. I quit cigarettes in the beginning of 2014, and quit electronic cigarettes for 2015. 

While I have been very proud that I no longer smoke, this year I feel like I still have vaped just as much - or even more than I smoked. With greater addiction and intensity; it is more easy to chain-puff on an e-cig inside than to chain-smoke cigarettes. Not entirely sure how much nicotine I've been using. Probably somewhere between 30-50 mg a day? I'm not entirely sure if my math is right or not. Regardless, I think it's too much, and it feels like I'm still always aching for a puff.

Addiction feels like the greatest challenge of my lifetime. It's constantly dogging me, nipping at my heels just when I think I've gotten away. Buddhists consider addictions as extreme attachment - or a means to quickly alleviate our dissatisfaction with our lives and present conditions of them. It's constant running, and you only realize that when you stop to look around. 

If you choose to use nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) like the patch, nicotine gum & lozenges, or even the electronic cig, know that you are still petting that addictive beast that chases you. For me, I have to watch myself over the next few weeks and really examine my thought processes, and watch for that voice which rationalizes the next smoke; "just this once" smoke, the "last time" smoke, the "I'm feeling shitty" smoke. It's not the cigarettes you need to boot from your life, it's the part of yourself which wants you to continue to smoke.

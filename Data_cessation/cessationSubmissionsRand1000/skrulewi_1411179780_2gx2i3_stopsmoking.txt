Ultimate Frisbee Tournament Tomorrow... I can breathe!

So, I got 171 days today. Tomorrow I go to an Ultimate Frisbee tournament.

Last night I actually had a craving for cigarettes again. Can't remember when... exactly... I was driving home, and I imagined going to the 7-11 to get some, and taking a few drags in my car. How nice it would feel, in the end of summer air... FUCK IT.

Tomorrow I go to an Ultimate Frisbee tournament. For whose who don't know, it's going to be about 6 hours of wind sprints. I gave up ultimate frisbee when I was smoking. It became an impossibility.

My recovery from cigarettes allows me to participate in my favorite sport again at a high level. Period. I give it up, and I give up my sports. The money, and long term health, I have a hard time wrapping my mind around. The sports? I can see that shit. 

When I was smoking, I would vomit every single game on the sideline. My circulation couldn't handle it. 

I haven't vomited once since quitting. Here's to 6 months, in a few weeks!

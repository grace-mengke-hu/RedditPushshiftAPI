200 days. Wouldnt have even known if i wasnt reminded.

As it's said, ad neasueum, it gets way easier. Check my history if you want to see the struggles I had in my earlier days. Now, I pretty much never even think of it. I forgot I had a quit smoking app installed, and today it decided to send a push notification for my 200 days smoke free, 4000 cigarettes not smoked, and over $2000 saved. 

Feel free to ask me anything if you're struggling. I've had struggles of my own, and would love to help if I can.

One hundred hours smoke free!

I wasn't able to post earlier due to being at work. But I am now one hundred hours into my quit!

I have rarely thought of a cig since around this time last night while I was offered one by a guest. (I work at a hotel and the rooms are all non - smoking so all of the guest venture past the front desk to walk outside, and usually offer me a smoke.

Luckily I haven't given in! I can already feel the difference in my breathing. The support from you guys is proving to be much help!

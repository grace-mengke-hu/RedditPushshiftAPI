Sleep Problems

Very close to the two weeks mark, my sleep problems haven't gone anywhere yet. 

I don't have trouble falling asleep, but then almost every night, I wake up in the middle of the night and can't fall asleep again. Now, a typical night for me is to go to bed around midnight and get up at 4 am.

Anyone experiencing similar sleeping disorders? Any idea when do they cease?

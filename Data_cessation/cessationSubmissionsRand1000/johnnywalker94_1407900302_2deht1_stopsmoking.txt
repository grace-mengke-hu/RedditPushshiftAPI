I'm not going to break(day 2)

Although two days does not seem much, it is the longest I have ever gone without a cigarette in years. My vape ran out of charge today and had a slight thought of buying a pack. Luckily I grabbed a stick of gum and said I can wait for a nicotine fix. I made it home and charged my vape with no more cravings. I'm so glad I did not relapse so quickly and will remember to keep my charger with me. I want to quit and hopefully the first time i try, I make it. I will be going out with a friend who is quitting as well tonight and I hope I do not relapse. I will try to post every day so I can stick to quitting and hopefully I can quit at an early age before it is too late...

Edit: My friend and I just talked about how great quitting was and how we should continue. I'm sure if we both quit we will do great.

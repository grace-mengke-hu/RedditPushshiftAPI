39 days? When did that happen?

Seriously, after the second week the major "give me a cigarette right now" cravings just.. left. Granted, I had only been smoking for four years, but wow! I really didn't expect that. 

Smoke smells horrible to me now, but I do sometimes think "I really could smoke right now," but it's so easy to tell myself no. It's interesting to see how easily I say yes to new challenges, now that I know I've conquered nicotine for well over a month. 

If I, a weak willed teenager can do it, surely you all can, too.

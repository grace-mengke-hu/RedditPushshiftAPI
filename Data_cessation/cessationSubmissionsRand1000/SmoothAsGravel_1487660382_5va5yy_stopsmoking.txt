I know cigarettes do nothing for me but I keep on smoking!

I've been smoking for almost a year now and I've tried to stop since I realised I was buying my own packs regularly. Being 17 when I started ( 18 now) I never imagined myself being a smoker and I was so against it my whole life. Since then I've lost so much of myself to cigarettes. Hiding it from my parents, my girlfriend (now ex) and later on from my friends when I said I quit but kept smoking behind their backs. So much of my mind is spent on waiting for my next cig at school, when I'm at home or even when I'm with my friends. I've tried so many times to just throw away my pack and end up buying a new one 1-4 days later and in doing this I've spent all the little money I earnt. There have been weeks where I've thrown my pack away and bought a new one 3 times in the same week! And mind you this is in Australia where cigarettes cost almost $25 a pack. I've read Allen Carr's method, watched the video and every possible YouTube video you can imagine. I even stopped for one whole week and ended up relapsing again. I'm so sick and tired of quitting now I can't even make it a whole day without buying a pack by nighttime. 

Sorry for the rant but I had to get it off my chest. I'm still gonna keep trying but the battle between the addiction and my hatred for cigarettes has taken a toll on me.

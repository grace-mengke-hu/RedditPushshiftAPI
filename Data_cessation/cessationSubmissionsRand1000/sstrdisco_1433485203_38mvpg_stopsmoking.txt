When did your sense of smell really kick back in?

For as long as I can remember, I've always thought I had allergies. When I quit smoking, I also cut out all the allergy medication, to see if it wasn't just the cigs. My nose is still runny and I'm still congested, just not as bad. And while my sense of smell has improved somewhat, I'm wondering if it will improve more.

I did go to the Dr. today, and I've been assigned Flonase. If that doesn't work, I'll try something else.

So anyway, when did you feel your sense of smell was back to normal?

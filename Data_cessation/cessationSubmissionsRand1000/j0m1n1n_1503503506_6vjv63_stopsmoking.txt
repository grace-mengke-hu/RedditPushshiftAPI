I want to eat all the things, all the time

Between quitting smoking and increasing my cardiovascular exercise, my appetite is through the roof. I can't seem to stay full for very long. One of my jobs is bartending at a restaurant. I get *one* comped meal each shift, but it's not enough to keep me full. I've been eating lunch immediately before I go to work, then waiting as long as possible to eat dinner, but I still get unbearably hungry again before my shift ends. I've been paying full price for a second dinner each night.

I'm not really worried about gaining weight since I'm very active. I'm more concerned about the expense of having to eat so much. Bringing my own food to work isn't really feasible. Do you have any good strategies for managing your appetite?

1st time checking in a while

Its been rough, but everyday seems to get easier... I feel so much better, my energy levels have increased significantly, I feel more disciplined and am able to get more done... Do I still get craving, yes but do they go away if I ignore them, yes.... I made it through my 1st night on binge drinking since I quit.. Honestly I would have smoked that night if I didn't have good support around me.  I bummed a cigarette from a friend and put it in my ear and was sniffing it...Kept telling myself I wasn't going to but when I was able to sneak away to find my lighter I would have.. Luckily a friend grabbed it out of my ear and stuck it in his bum... Didn't want it after that... Gotta love family and friends lol... Well heres to another day of not smoking!

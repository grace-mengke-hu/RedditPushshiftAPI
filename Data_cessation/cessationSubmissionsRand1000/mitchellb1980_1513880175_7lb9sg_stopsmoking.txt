Non smoker view of smokers and money...

Being this far out of smoking there is something I notice common with a lot of smokers....

The constant griping about money/negative attitude to things costing money...

Example, co worker griping about his GF wanting to go out to a pricey resturaunt for her Son's Birthday Dinner because it will be a costly meal ($50 per person)...

Not saying I'd be thrilled about a meal that much either, but wouldn't be so negative about it...

Guarantee he smoke a pack a day at 13 or 14 bucks without thinking about it.... but its something I have noticed, and I know I was guilty of it when i smoked as well, watching every penny yet blowing a ton of cash up in smoke...

The negativity definitely creeps in easier as smokers, that I know for a fact...

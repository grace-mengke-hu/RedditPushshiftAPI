All you New Years Quitters - Be strong!

I decided last year to quit. 02JAN2015 was my quit date. I am smoke free for 2015. All desire to smoke is gone. Cigarettes are a distant memory.

It is not all roses. First few days are rough, first few weeks are uncomfortable. But then you just gradually forget about the smokes. But it is well worth the effort.

You can do it! And come back here next year to let us know about your accomplishment.

My Cessation Nation app stats are

363 days since quitting
$1,818 saved
3,640 not smoked

Happy 2016!

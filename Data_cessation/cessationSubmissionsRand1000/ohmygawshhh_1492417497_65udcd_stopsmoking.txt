Weight Gain with quitting?

I know this sounds bad but I practically live off coffee and cigarettes with the occasional bowl of rolled oats and yoghurt or a diet coke in the mix, seems so much worse as I am writing and then reading this back. But does anyone have any personal experience to share on weightgain associated with quitting? I really don't want to gain weight. I also don't want to die of lung cancer either? Or have a saggy dead wrinkle face.
Any tips on healthy snacking as a replacement or things to take your mind off it? I feel like I'll dive headfirst into a pool of chocolate and bread if I stop.

Thanks!

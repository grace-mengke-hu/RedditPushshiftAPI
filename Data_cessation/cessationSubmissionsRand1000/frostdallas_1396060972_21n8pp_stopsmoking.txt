Had a victory a few days ago.

I quit 45 days ago because, as a vocalist, I couldn't compete with the best while sporting a pack-a-day habit. I just couldn't. My challenge to myself to become the best I could be would never happen like that.

On Tuesday night I had my first show since I had quit smoking. I was nervous… but it went great. I could actually carry the performance without gasping for breath and faltering halfway through the song. My voice was strong, powerful. The high I was on after coming off stage… after thinking I'd never perform that well, ever… I almost had to go outside to keep from breaking down. I can't even imagine what possibilities lay in store for me years from now, when my lungs have truly recovered.

To those of you who are wondering if it's worth it… it is. Find your reason to keep saying "no" to cigarettes, whatever that may be.

If your job depend on your steady hand and quitting makes you have shaky hands, take a few days off, or ask your boss to reassign you to a less delicate task for a month...

Realise how you are always nervous waiting for your next cigarette. You think life is this way, because you cant remember when it wasnt this way. Its the last cigarrete you smoked an hour ago what is making you tense now, not life.

I can see clearly as the sky this now after 53 days... 12 years smoking and this is my second try. I wish I had quited before. Tobacco brought this stress to my life... but it was so constant and subtle that I took it as the base line for life. IT IS NOT!

Smoking for a year and still struggling to quit

Ok so I'll give some context, I'm 18, I was a vehement anti-smoker until one day I got very drunk last year and someone offered me a cigarette, which in my mindless state I accepted, and so it began.

I've been smoking now since May last year, longest I've gone without a cigarette is a week, recently been trying very hard to completely get rid of them from my life, made three days last week and three days again but had a stressful day and thought one wouldn't hurt. On day 2 of not smoking currently.

In my sober days it's not so hard, and I think I'll be able to make it til next Saturday, but the thing is I don't know now how I'll enjoy my big night out to kick off summer next weekend without my cigarettes, I really just can't imagine a night out or being drunk without them, every single time I've been on a night out I've smoked. 

Until last night I was going to keep buying fags while I was only drunk, but I realised that this is stupid and I'm still wasting money, but goddam I don't know how I'll enjoy myself without them for situations like this. 

I guess I'm making this post to become a part of this community, been lurking for a while, hopefully this will help me.

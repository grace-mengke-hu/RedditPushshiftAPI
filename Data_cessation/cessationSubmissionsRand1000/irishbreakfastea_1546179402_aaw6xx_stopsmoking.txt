Down to two cigs a day. Should I try a vape?

I’ve been smoking for 15 years, with a couple of successful quit attempts in the last ranging from a few weeks to one year.  In the last for months I have cut down to just two cigs a day.  One in the afternoon after lunch and one in the evening after dinner.

I’m proud for making it this far but I want to quit smoking entirely.  However I feel these two cigarettes are still controlling me.  I’ve tried nicotine gum, it helps but it’s just not the same.  I’m thinking of buying an e cigarette.  I’m in the UK right now and the Public Health agency of England has been going on the news saying smokers should switch as its 95 percent less harmful.

I’m so close to quitting and part of me wants to do it without aids, but I haven’t been able to stop he two smokes a day.  Should I give it a go?

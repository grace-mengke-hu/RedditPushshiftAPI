Want some high fives for your quit? Go see your dentist! 😃

Went for a cleaning today, my first one as a non-smoker! They were so excited for me, everyone was giving me congratulations and high fives haha, it felt so good! I’ve been telling them for the last year or so that I was working my way towards quitting so it felt like having my very own cheerleading squad there today, so that was fun! 

Almost at the two week mark and feeling good. I’m still on 3/4 of a step 1 patch so about 15mg (I’ve been cutting them down by 1/4). The other morning I was like, “well why don’t I just not bother putting it on today and see what happens?” Uh no. We’re gonna do the step downs haha. That’s ok! I am not ashamed to need the help, I’m just happy to not be smoking. I see the doc this Wednesday and I’m going to ask him to just give me the step 2 (14mg) patches though, seeing as how I’m basically already there. Hopefully in a couple more weeks I can get to step 3! Looking forward to it.

Hope everybody’s having a not horrible Monday! 😁

Everytime I quit I get a little closer to the goal.

Reading some of people's stories have really helped. I have been quitting again and again but realised new things on the way. At first I could only quit for a day or two with patches. Then I really impressed myself with a week. Such a big deal for me but didn't really mean anything to the 'never smoked' crowds. I realised that I ran out of patches on one attempt and didn't buy anymore. That's when I learnt about will power. I think that didn't just teach me how to use my inner strength not to smoke but I could use will power on many other things. I eventually failed again. I learnt that patches don't work for me and sometimes I can have bad quits and good quits but I need to really believe in me. I went cold turkey with no patches or gum and this time I went for 9 months! I really surprised myself. Unfortunately stress seems to be a big trigger and an unexpected loss of my 2 year old niece really hit everyone in my family hard. I literally saw her the week before she passed away and that was to celebrate her 2nd birthday. It's been really bad and I lost a lot of myself. I didn't really care about anything or anyone because I don't understand why she is gone. I have got to the point now that I am ready to quit again and this time feels like the last. I'm seeing money build up and I have learnt talking to loved ones about why I'm stressed without burdening has helped. My willpower is high and this time it has been tough but im tougher.

Having a "thing"

On Day 1 of not smoking at it occurred to me... Part of smoking is having a "thing." A thing to do when you are sad, a thing to do to celebrate, etc. Have any of you who have quit for a long time found something to be your new "thing?"

I imagine a week from now I do something awesome at work... And what do I do? Just stand up and put my fists on my hips and stare off into the distance? There has to be something. 

Drinking seems obvious but you can't do that at work or before driving. 

Thoughts?

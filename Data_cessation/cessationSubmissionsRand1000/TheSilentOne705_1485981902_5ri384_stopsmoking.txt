I, too, have gained a star on my flair

And I don't feel much different than when I was smoking. There's differences, sure: I breathe easier, I'm a little more energetic, things smell and taste a bit stronger, and I'm a bit more clear headed.

But all in all, there's not a ton of difference. Surprisingly, that makes me want to NOT smoke EVEN MORE. I'm having too much fun in my life. I'm making more costumes, I'm planning more events, I'm examining my life a bit more, and I'm getting outside more often. I'm taking charge of my life and my schedule a bit more. I've got some of the COOLEST plans coming up for this year and I'm excited to do them instead of jonesing for a cig.

And it's ALL YOUR FAULT, /r/stopsmoking. Yes, you heard me. All yours. So now it's time to get to the next goal: 2 months. And then 3. And then 6. And then a year. And then on and on, until it becomes such an ingrained habit to resist that I don't even have to think about it anymore.

What are the actual tips to help people like me stop smoking?

I'm 22, I've been smoking since I was 14 but it wasnt as bad.  I'd usually smoke whenever someone have it so it wasn't everyday. It became frequent when my convenient store clerk started selling it to me when I was 17 when he found out I wouldn't rat him out. I started smoking 6-8 times a day or depending on the mood. I would finish a pack when I'm at a party or when I am really bored. I don't smoke when I'm at home as I always keep myself busy by playing MMO games, and also when my relatives are around. 

When someone asked me how long ive been smoking, I told them I started when I was 14 and it gave me a sudden realization that I've been smoking for 8 years. It felt so quick and when I think about how I've been smoking disgusts me.

I want to change and I haven't smoked for the past 4 days. I'm here cause I can't seem to hold it in anymore and whenever my friends lit a cigarette, I would shake and crave. The smell, the feel & texture is what I miss.

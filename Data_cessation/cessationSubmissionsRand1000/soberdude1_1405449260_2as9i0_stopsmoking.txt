600 DAYS!!!

Grateful to be a free man today. With the knowledge learned from Mr. Allen Carr's book, this quit was easy and it stuck!!! Keep up the good fight everyone. Struggling? Can't hurt to read the book and learn the truth about your nicotine addiction and all the lies we believe that keep us smoking.

No patches, no gum, no pretend cigarettes, cravings and withdrawal that were so mild, quitting was easy.

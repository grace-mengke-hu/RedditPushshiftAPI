1 Week done. Using Step 2 nicotine patches this time

I have been trying to quit pretty hard Singh March this year. Tried going cold turkey and failed after 13 days. Tried using nicotine gums and again failed after 14 days. This time giving a try to patches and seems going good. 

The good part is this time am not having that feeling of missing or giving up something but instead feel release from a trap and getting control of my life back. Though few people say NRT is not good but I say do anything and everything to get yourself away from bloody ciggrate. Because as per me nicotine is fine but the popular source of getting it which is the ciggrate is not good . 

What say people?

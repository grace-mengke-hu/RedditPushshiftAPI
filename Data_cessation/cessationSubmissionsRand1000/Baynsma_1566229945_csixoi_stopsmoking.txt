Hang in there! It's worth it.

Motivation for anyone quitting right now: After 6 weeks of not smoking, I come here to happily report that I am more or less free of my addiction. I feel like a non-smoker. I don't think about cigarettes, I don't crave them, I don't feel like I've "given up" anything. I feel like I'm free of that inconvenient and expensive habit. I feel more disciplined, in control and proud of myself. It wasn't difficult. I just decided, I'm not going to smoke anymore, and so I haven't. I watched all of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, which if you've seen it, every character basically has a cigarette hanging out of their mouths every scene. Not once was I triggered in the slightest. I don't think about it, I don't miss it. Just more time for me dancing inside instead of freezing outside or thinking about my next cigarette! I've also cut down on my eating and am much more in control of myself generally, so I'm losing weight and feeling way healthier. So yeah, in the past I've found it difficult to quit, but this time is surprisingly super easy, and I'm as close to sure it's for good as I can be. I honestly sit with people smoking all the time without the least craving or discomfort. The only discernible difference is, when people smoke near me, I enjoy the smell. So I find it quite pleasant, which is a good thing, as you'd expect that to be when the cravings hit. And for those dealing with cravings - remember to **breathe deeply**, also remember that you're not missing anything, remember it's not forever, and remember you'll thank yourself for it - also remember it's OK to fail, and that each time you try and quit, you get better at it. But you have to want it. It can be hard to break habits if you're co-dependant with other people - but try moving house, living by yourself, changing environments etc. I'm here if anyone wants to talk about it.

Getting back on the wagon...again.

Quit for about 3 weeks the first time, smoked a pack, quit for a little over a month and then fell off the wagon hard last week (smoked probably 3 packs over the week.)  Picked up some more nicotine patches this weekend and got back on the wagon yesterday.  If I keep trying, eventually this will stick right??

I am ashamed of myself.

I was not smoking for 101 days.

Yesterday a friend came by.

Even though my badge was initially ment for cigarettes, i did share a joint with him.

I am NOT proud of myself, i feel deep remorse.

I did not smoke cigarettes though, and i intend to do so for the rest of my life.

But just because this shitty joint got tobacco inside i am feeling like i broke my vow.

Should i reset my badge?

EDIT: I did reset my badge. Tobacco is tobacco, even this small ammount. Let's hope this time it will be longer :)

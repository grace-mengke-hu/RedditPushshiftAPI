Oh god the mouth ulcers

I haven't had sores like this since childhood; it wasn't even necessarily a smoking thing; I'm just not generally prone to them. 
But I'm two weeks in now and I have the biggest freaking ulcer ever, and it is driving me mental. This is apparently fairly normal, but auuuugh. 

Just some advice on dealing with the discomfort? I'm not accustomed to it, and it's making to difficult to eat and not poke (I, admittedly, tried to lance it last night, which didn't work and really hurt).

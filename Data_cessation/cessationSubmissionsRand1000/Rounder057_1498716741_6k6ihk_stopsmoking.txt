I made it a week!

A full 7 days from jump. Cold turkey! No vape! No gum! No patch! Just skin crawling anxiety and a drive to be healthier. Here is what I have realized in a week. 
It seems like more people have started smoking since I quit. Every where I look somebody has a cigarette in their hand! 
I have all of this extra room in my pockets! It feels weird now, like I am missing half of the things that I own, turns out they owned me. 
I can smell when some guy just had a smoke. I must have been in denial about what I thought I smelled like. Hand sanitizer and gum was not the cure all I thought it was. 
There is garlic in this meal?!? Hey! There is garlic in here! I can taste the garlic!
It has been a rough road and I know it still is a process but I already like the me that doesn't smoke so much more.

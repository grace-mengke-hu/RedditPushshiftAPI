I could handle everything... except travelling. Now I'll start over. Day 2.

I conquered my cravings one day at the time. I was ok with my friends smoking near me. I studied and passed all the exams. I did not touch a cig for 44 days. Then I went to work abroad for the months of june and july. After 3 hours on the train I got to my first destination. I IMMEDIATELY felt like having a cigarette. It was the first time I was reaching another city and not taking a cig out to smoke. It almost physically hurt. I went all day craving. Eventually, after 24 hours of non-stop cravings I ended up negotiating with myself. I'd smoke while I'm abroad and I'd stop again when I'd come back to my country.

It was stupid. Yeah. I knew the cravings would eventually stop. I was too weak.

Now... I'm back at Portugal. My friends don't know I stopped stopping, so I will just try to convince myself that nothing actually changed since before the summer, that I'm still a "non-smoker". It will be hard again the first few days. But it's all my fault and I know I have to deal with the consequences. Now it starts again. I will not spend my hard earned money in fuckin' death sticks anymore.

Thank you for your attention.

My appetite is back in full force now.

Food tastes more amazing than I remember and I want to eat all of it.
My old routine was to smoke after coming home or to suppress food cravings when I know I shouldn't eat that little Debbie, and now I have unknowingly replaced it with a bowl of ice cream or pita chips and hummus or pepperoni and cheese on crackers. I can't stop. My appetite is out of control and I'm blaming it on the lack of those cancer sticks. 
It's getting to the point where some items of clothing are much more snug than when I last wore them. This is a problem, because I don't want to buy new clothes. The old me would just give up and start smoking again to drop the excess weight, but new smoke-free-way-to-be me is going to have to buck up, tweak my diet, and start exercising. In fact, I think I'll replace my afternoon snack with a short 15-30 min workout. 

It took me five years quit because I didn't want to be fat. It took 41 days being smoke-free for me to realize if I don't want to be fat, then I have to work for it instead of using something that is slowing killing me as a crutch.

Thanks for taking the time to read my little story.

One week in - better than expected!

So one week ago today I abruptly quit smoking - I've been thinking about it for awhile but hadn't really intended to try until after the holidays.  Something snapped inside me and I decided not to buy another pack - instead I went to the local vape shop and picked myself up a small mod and some high nic juice.  I can't really explain what's different this time, but I'm still 100% certain I will never, ever have another cigarette.  

Probably because I'm only giving up the additives, not the nicotine, my withdrawal symptoms are easier to handle than I'd anticipated.  I've definitely still had some mood issues (though, admittedly, I'm prone to those on a good day!) and I swear my aches can't all be from the cold front that's moving through, but it's been nothing like quitting cold turkey.  I know NRT (and vaping specifically) isn't helpful to everyone, but I definitely credit this first bit of success with me being able to seamlessly swap out my habits.  

I'm afraid I might be jumping the gun a little bit (the ecig sub definitely seems to think so) but I'm dropping my nicotine level today from 12mg to ~10.5mg.  I'm haven't been limiting my intake at all so far, and I'm not starting yet, but I'm going to do a better job of keeping track of how much juice I'm going through.  I mixed up 20mL of 10.5mg today, and when the 12mg I've got in my vape now runs out, I'm taking the leap.

There stands a chance that I'll be nicotine free by the holidays - and even if not, I'll be three months into a quit I hadn't even expected to start yet!  I've never felt this confident at this stage - bring on another week!

86 days and having a craving out of nowhere, just figured I would post and kill some time

Just killing some time while I wait for this craving to be over. Don't really have the motivation to do anything so just kind of going zombie mode and mindlessly browsing the internet.

It's been 86 days now, I feel a lot better, most of my daily life is undisturbed. I blend in really well with the environment now, and my brain is pretty innocent. A couple of times I've gotten comments like "Oh how I wish I was young again" in response to me just being me, which felt pretty good, because while I'm young, if you would have seen me the past years, I would have looked more like [this](https://i.redd.it/ylr3nyblxfpy.jpg)

I'll stop boring you guys now, adios amigos

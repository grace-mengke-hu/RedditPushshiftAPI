Anxiety and panic attacks, huge triggers

I really feel like if I had some nicotine available I would break right now. Idk maybe I should grow up and learn how adults deal with anxiety. Don't smoke, it would help you forget your anxiety for about 5 minutes, then it would return and you'll just light up another.

Going to drink some water and do my best to keep my resolve, realizing this feeling is just a feeling. It will pass.

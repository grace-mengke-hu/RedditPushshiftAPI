Third "real" attempt, and feeling really weak today

Trying to quit smoking is one of the most frustrating things I've ever had to do. I keep trying and failing. I turned 21 recently, spent a good amount of time binge drinking with friends - therefore smoking as well. I'm finally coming down from my bender and also trying to quit smoking for the third time now. I've made it a week so far but every time I smell smoke, eat a meal, or get stressed I instantly want to light up, and I feel like my cravings are getting worse from the first couple days. Luckily where I live right now getting cigarettes is quite a task, so I've been able to talk myself out of it when I really am dying for one. Today though I am feeling really, really weak. I'm so stressed with work and I just want to smoke. 

Are the cravings ever going to actually get better? Am I still going to have these triggers forever that will make me want to smoke?

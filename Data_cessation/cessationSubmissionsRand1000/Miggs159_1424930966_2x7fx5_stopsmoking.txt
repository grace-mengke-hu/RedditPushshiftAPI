Day Three was easy peasy

Day 3 was a lot easier than I thought, my cravings went down, I even held a cigarette in my hand and had no desire to light it. I have a long journey ahead of me but I like what I'm seeing. For all of those who just started or thinking about it.. just go for it you have everything to lose if you don't. Thank you for all the help and positive reinforcement!!!!

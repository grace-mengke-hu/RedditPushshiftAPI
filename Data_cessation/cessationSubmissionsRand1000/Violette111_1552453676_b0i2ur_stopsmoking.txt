To all nicotine gum users...I quit nicotine gums 4 days ago...what withdrawal symptoms / side effects did you guys experience?

I was a smoker for 10 years, a pack a day and I’m smoke free for 2 years now. I used nicotine gums to quit and it was quite successful except that I was addicted to the gums. I can’t believe I’m over 3 days nicotine free now but I’m starting to feel brain fog and a little sleepy / drowsy during day time. Is this normal? Maybe it’s also because I quit coffee. 

Are there any other side effects / withdrawal symptoms you guys experienced? Any reports of weight gain, skin getting clearer, headaches?

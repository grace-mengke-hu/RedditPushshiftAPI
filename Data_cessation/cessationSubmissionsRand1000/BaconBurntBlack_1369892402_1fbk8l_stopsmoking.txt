I joined this subreddit a month ago on a whim, and I've tried quitting a few times, but failed each time. But there's now light at the end of the tunnel!

I've tried quitting a few times in the past month, and while I was able to cut back significantly, I always ended up walking to the drug store to get a pack after a few days.  The cravings were just completely in control of my brain.

But there's hope! I'm currently finished with Day 3 again, and I can honestly say that it is the easiest its ever been! I think I've adjusted my brain by *trying* to quit so much in such a short time.  Paired with a new diet and exercise, it has slowly gotten easier and easier for me to get through the day without lighting up.  I think I can really do it this time :) and if worst comes to worst and this time doesn't work out, I will keep fighting the good fight because I know the next time I try, I will have even more control over my cravings, and there will be less nicotine in my system to fight against.

Anywho, I just wanted to express my thoughts and give a shout out to this subreddit, you are really changing my life.

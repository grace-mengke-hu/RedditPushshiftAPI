I feel pathetic

I was smoke free for a long time. Then I rewarded myself with 1 cig. Then friends would give me cigs at parties. Then I bought a package myself for party... My SO is angry at me. Last evenning we were at a party and nothing would stop me from smoking. She said some sentences to me like: "Nice of you that you quit smoking" - sarcastic, "If you want then smoke", "I don't believe that you will stop smoking anymore". I love her so much and I did it to me myself. I could be almost 1 year non-smoker and I'm reseting my badge today for good. I don't feel pathetic actually.

I am pathetic.

Guys. Please don't smoke. Don't make your life miserable

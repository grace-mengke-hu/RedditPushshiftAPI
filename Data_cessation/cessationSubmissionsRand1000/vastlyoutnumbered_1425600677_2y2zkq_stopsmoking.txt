WTF? Sudden Craving

So I've had a a bit of a shit day today at Uni and when I came home I had a real strong urge/craving/memory for a cigarette. I don't have any in the house and if I did, I wouldn't have given in (I'm way stronger than that after 200 and 30 odd days). It just felt, so, weird. Do any of you guys get random cravings years after you quit? Or, is this a first year thing?

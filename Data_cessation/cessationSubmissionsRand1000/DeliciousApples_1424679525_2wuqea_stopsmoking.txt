Managed a party with no smokes!

This was my worry. My friends have a lot of impromptu parties and they all smoke. I had one of them all night being like "if you need a cigarette just grab one!" so temptation was there but I managed. Proud of myself. Chest is already feeling loads clearer. So here's to not smoking!

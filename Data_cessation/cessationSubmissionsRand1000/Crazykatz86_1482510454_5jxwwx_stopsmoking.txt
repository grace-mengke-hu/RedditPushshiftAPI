Day 12 and going out...

So I have not had any alcohol since stopping smoking.  It seems like all my previous attempts at not smoking were thwarted by alcohol... that and a lack of willpower. Today is my day off and the hubby and I are going  o see Star Wars I've been waiting to have a day off where I can actually enjoy it followed by dinner.  I'm kinda looking forward to a nice glass of Pinot but I'm a lil nervous about cravings.  So far the last 24 hours have been pretty good... how do you guys deal with alcohol and not smoking?

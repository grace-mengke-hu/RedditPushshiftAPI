One year smoke free!!!

Oh my gosh. It's not that I can't believe I have accomplished it but a year ago I wouldn't have believe that I would be here. I remember thinking how hard it was the first couple of days. Maybe even weeks but all I remember are the first days. 

Two weeks after I quit I had a miscarriage. Even through all that stress and sadness I still never picked up a cigarette. I knew I didn't want it to be for nothing and I knew I was going to try again for a baby so I didn't want to go through that pain again. 

Here I am 17 weeks pregnant. To celebrate this beautiful day of 1 year quit my husband and I are holding a small gender reveal party for all the people in our lives that supported us through our miscarriages. 

We found out two days ago we are having a boy and we couldn't be happier. I cannot thank this subreddit enough for the support you gave me to keep staying quit. 

I had many questions in the beginning. I would read other people's struggles and knew I wasn't alone and that they were doing it so why couldn't I?! So I did. And here I am. I feel normal again. Just like I wanted.

I want to share a story with you guys. Read if you think of smoking.

Hi. Been smoking for 3 years and stopped as the badge says. I should reset it but I'm on the phone right now using app. If I already reset my badge just FYI I was clean for over 9 weeks. I didn't stink, I was happy, I started to run over 10 km in less than 2 weeks! My SO was motivating me and she was happy I quit this horrible addiction. Everything was great until one stupid day when I bought a pack.I tell you guys. 4th day is the worst. If you go pass through it you will have less and less need to smoke, of that I'm certain. The most important thing I learned is to avoid the toxic environment where you were smoking. Eg. Don't go to a parties when you quit, don't play league of legends if you need a small puff just before game. Don't meet with smokers for a while if it will help. Often, smoking comes with alkohol. Don't go to a parties, you just can't. If you want to go back to drink alcohol start slowly. Like 1 beer in your home and see how do you react etc. With time, add more beers to menu and go more and go back to your old environment.Another good advice i can give you is to read this sub reddit. Read it when you want to smoke. When i was reading this i thought it just reminds me of smoking and doesn't help. Not true! Read, comment and share your experiences with others. This community is the greatest of all the reedits.Don't be like me and surrender because you have worse day. Everyone has got worse days. It is all about how do you go through this hard time.I'm sorry for my English. Not my native language but i think I made my point. Stay motivated . IMO quiting smoking is best decision a smoker one can make in his life.

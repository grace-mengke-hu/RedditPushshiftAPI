It's been two months since I quit

I already went out bunch of times with friends to drink/hang out, not once were I close to lighting one up, it's a great feeling to not be a slave to this addiction and it's sad watching other people destroy their health, especially my parents. I'd really like to talk to them about quitting but I know it's of no use unless they realize the harm themselves.

Keep telling yourself that you're not "quitting smoking", you quit.

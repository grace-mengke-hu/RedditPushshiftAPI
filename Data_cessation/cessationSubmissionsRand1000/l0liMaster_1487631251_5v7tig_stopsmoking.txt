Officially past the 2-month point!

I think this is the farthest I've ever come. Only took like what, 4 tries? haha. 

You can do it!!! Free yourself from the shackles of nicotine!

I do still crave occasionally but not nearly as much as I used to or thought I would. Life's a simpler time when it's not revolving around smoking. Don't need to plan my budget to fit in my packs every week, don't need to take that 5-10 minute break every half hour that I'm doing work, don't need to be wary of the nasty smell of filters on my fingers.

It's pretty great. Get 'em!

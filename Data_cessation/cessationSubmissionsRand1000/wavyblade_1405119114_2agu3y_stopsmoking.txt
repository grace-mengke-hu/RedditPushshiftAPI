it's been just over one blessed and magically wonderful year AMA!!

it's been quite awhile since I've been around here, but this community was instrumental in helping me destroy the nicotine demon I was harboring.  I'm going to make visits here more often and encourage those still trapped to break free, I owe it the ones that helped me.  AMA!

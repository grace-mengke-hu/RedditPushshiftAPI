Broken Badge (frozen at 159 days)

Has anyone else had this problem? I quit smoking on the day I joined Reddit, so my badge and Reddit age have always been the same. 
But the last 5 days my badge hasn't changed, it should be 164 days but only says 159 days. 
I've messaged the mods but not sure they got it, maybe I should remove it and then request it again?

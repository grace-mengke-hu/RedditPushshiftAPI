Epic fail yesterday, back on track today.

Yesterday sucked.  Plain and simple, it was just a terrible, terrible day.  I bought some cigarettes and smoked almost the entire pack (I think I had like 3 left at the end of day.)  Put a patch back on this morning and I'm trying again.  Just gotta stick with it I guess.

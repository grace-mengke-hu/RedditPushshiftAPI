Whoa! Dreamt of smoking after 8 months

Used to smoke pack/day for over 20 years. Never thought I could quit, but now I’m 8 months nicotine free.  The cravings are minimal and have been for the past few months. Out of nowhere...last night I had one of those vivid dreams about smoking and I woke up craving big time. This really caught me off guard! I didn’t do anything and the cravings have passed, but this still freaked me out. I guess the point of this post is to educate that you must always stay vigilant against nicotine. This drug is “smart” and will strike at any point of weakness. Stay strong everyone!!

74 days and loving it

So on new years eve i saw nothing was going well for me, so i ended up smoking at least a packet and a half in just a few hours. And the day after i was a wreck, apart from having a hangover, and that was the day that i stopped smoking. The money i saved is being put aside so i can use it to reward myself with something later on.

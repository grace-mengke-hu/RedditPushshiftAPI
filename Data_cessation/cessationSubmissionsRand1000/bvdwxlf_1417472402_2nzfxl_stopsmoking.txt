Day 36 (!)

So this is the longest I've ever not smoked after I started. Feeling great, much healthier and cleaner :) 
One thing I noticed is I still get pretty strong cravings from time to time, does anyone else experiene this? I feel like they should've at least decreased in intensity, that they have not done.

Anyway, as someone in the +1 month- club, a word of advice. The craving goes away. That's something many people don't remember when struggling with quitting. The uncomfortable feeling is temporary, and if you can distract yourself only for 10 or so minutes, you're more likely to not smoke. 

I smoked in a dream last week. Even in the dream it was very anticlimatic and didn't taste as good as I thought it would. I felt so shitty when I woke up, until I realized 'twas only a dream.

Keep up the good work everyone!

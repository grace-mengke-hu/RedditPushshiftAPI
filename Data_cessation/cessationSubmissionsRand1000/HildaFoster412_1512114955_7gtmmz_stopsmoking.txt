4th Month’s Reflections

Hi everyone, hope you all are doing well in your journey. I just wanted to share with you what’ s on my mind while I read a few posts on this community. 
I was reassuring someone who was worried that the cravings might last for a long time and I said that for me they went away very quickly. But if the cravings are long gone what am I doing here? 
I asked myself that question and I realized that my motive is that, as a neo-ex-smoker, it is important to be humble and keep in mind that more committed and determined people than one might happen to be have lapsed. It’s important to keep in mind that lapses are not necessarily the end of the world, but are seriously destructive, dangerous, always painful. They must be avoided! Reading the posts of people generous enough to share helps me cultivate the readiness I need for moments that right now seem very unlikely to arrive, but that are known with certainty to arrive. People who quit for a long time relapse.
So, my message for people who have just quit a few days ago is, don’t think that being here after months or years from the quit date means that you are always going to obsess over cigarettes. This is very rarely the case as far as I know, and it’s definitely not true in my case. My message for people who are already on their 3rd or 9th or whatever month smoke free, keep watching yourself and don’t smoke another puff no matter what.

Hope this helps someone out there :)

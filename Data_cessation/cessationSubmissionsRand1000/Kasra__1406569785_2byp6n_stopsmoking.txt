Going into week two...

Whew. This past weekend was very hard. I fought off so many cravings and if it wasn't for my husband I'd probably be calling myself a smoker today. So glad to have his support and reading this subreddit has kept me motivated as well! Thanks guys! 


I feel like my positive attitude is slipping away and my depression is coming back in force... Hopefully I can stick with this.


What has everyone experienced in their second week of being smoke free? Anything to look forward to?

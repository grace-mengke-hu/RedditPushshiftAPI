My 3 sons😊

Our boys 22,20,17 and hubby are so proud of me, it feels so good. I’m a lil over 3 months and we were watching tv and one of those horrible smoking commercials came on and my youngest smiled at me and wanted a fist pump👱‍♀️🤜🤛❤️.  I’m also noticing how much more time I have with them and doing family stuff with them and their girlfriends. We are all thinking of a 5k next year!

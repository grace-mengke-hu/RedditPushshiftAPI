It's a new week!

This is my first Monday as a NON SMOKER!! After I took all the kids to school this morning I took myself to Starbucks. Routine Monday morning stop for most,  but for me it's a treat I never allow myself.  That shits expensive.  But Today because I made it through the hardest day so far yesterday,  I treated myself without second thought.  It was a small reward,  but one I freaking earned.  I'm so proud of myself.  I'm doing this and it feels GREAT!  Happy Monday my non smoking buddies. Let's make today the best day we can!  And do something nice for someone.  It's a high better than nicotine.

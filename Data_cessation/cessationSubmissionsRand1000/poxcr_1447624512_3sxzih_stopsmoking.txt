3 months

Well, it's been three months since my last cigarette. It has not been that tough, using a ecig for the first couple of months as nic replacement. I switched to nic free vapor about a month ago and haven't looked back, I just vape a little at night. Now I can even hang with smokers and tell them how bad it smells. :-P

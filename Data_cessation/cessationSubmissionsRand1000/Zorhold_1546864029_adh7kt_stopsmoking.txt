Rebounded after only 2 days

Well, i drunkenly gave in yesterday after 2 days.
I then realised it was because i didn't prepare enough for what quitting actually meant, this addiction is just the worst. I'm gonna give myself until Saturday to prepare my next attempt by making a list of why i dislike smoking and a list what quitting will help me with. Just try again and again until you make it.

Does anybody have any tips for me to prepare myself for what comes during and after these 5 days? I already use the Smoke Free app, so there's that. Thank you, everybody!

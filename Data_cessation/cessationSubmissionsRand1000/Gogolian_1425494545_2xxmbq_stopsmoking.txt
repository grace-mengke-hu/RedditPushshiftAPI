I just hit 3 weeks being a non smoker.

Hello again.

I must say i feel ashamed by how little i come here to support you guys. Forgive me on this one :)

Yet, I would like to share some tips with you which i belive helped me a lot so here i go:

A little bacstory is: I did quit 3 weeks ago after listening to allen carr's audiobook, and some other online resources. I'm 28. I was 13 years, non-top 1,5 pack a day smoker, with previous quitting failures.

I thought smoking is part of who i am and helps me think. I cannot belive of how wrong i was.

Although i didn't use any nicotine substitutes, i do not agree with carr's idea that it's pointless, and i do not agree with other things in his book as well but that's not the point anyway.

The first 3 days were defineatly the worst. Cravings all the time and constant looking online for resources, help and techniques on how to deal with them. At this point the techique of tensing my whole body (with eyes closed) and releasing the tension was one of the best. 

There was just one thing on my mind during days 1 - 3: "Whatever you do - do not smoke. Anything is better than smoking."

I wanted a strategy. I needed a strategy.I knew one thing: I cannot just ignore smokers and move my eyes away from any smoker that i see in my life - that would be stupid and pointless.

Trying to just "force" it wouldn't be much help either. 

So i started seeing each craving as a battle from which i gain experiance to go onward. (Yeah, just like an RPG game (final fantasy forever!))

Every time i saw a smoker and a carving went in i immediatly went to battle mode (not litteraly though, that would be scary).

What it involved:

- Reminding myself that **HE** is the one that is poisoning himself not me.

- Reminding myself that **HE** is the one that is kidding himself into thinking this is enjoyable.

- Reminding myself that **HE** is addicted, and i just have minor withdrawal symptoms that will go away in few seconds

- Reminding myself that **HE** is the one that lies to himself everyday every moment even, not me anymore.

- If I smell the cigarette I immediatly cough (even if i dont need to) to teach my brain anew that this is bad. (Neural coorelations. Science bch!)

Then, if i needed more:

- Trying to imagine this situation as i would never been addicted in the first place. How would it feel?

- Reminding myself that the carving will go away in 3 min tops.

- Reminding myself of how long do i not smoke and how good it is for me. (Trying to remember long therm benefits)

- Take a really deep breath (NOT WITH THE CIGARETTE SMOKE EXHALED FROM THE OTHER SMOKER THOUGH!!)

And last but not least:

- Remembering my own oath to myself on top of the bridge in Warsaw, when i broke all my remaining cigarettes and threw them down with pack and lighter down to the Wis≈Ça river. :)

I cannot belive it was 3 weeks ago! Feels like forever!

So now i feel great, carvings are really, really rare and i started doing sports (which i always wanted but was to short-breath to do). 

The main thing is: I am still myself.

There's more to that... I am more myself than i remember being for the last 13 years...

I feel like a 17 year old again.

I kind of feel robbed of part of me when i was a smoker, and on the other hand, relived that i got my freedom and the other part of myself back :)

Don't get me wrong: I still have problems, but i deal with them the same way i dealt when i saw a smoker - just without cigarettes.

**TL;DR:** Don't just force it or ignore it. Cope with carvings and learn on your own how to deal with them. You'll get experiance and the next carving will be easier to deal with. Repeat untill happy, and can look a smoking smoker in the eye and smile :)

PS: Right now even in my dreams i reject cigarettes that my friends are giving me and i'm proud of it :)

Thanks for reading and stay strong, i love you guys.

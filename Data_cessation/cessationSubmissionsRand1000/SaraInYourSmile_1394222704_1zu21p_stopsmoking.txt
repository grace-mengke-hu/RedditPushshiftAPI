Day 2 is going well

Day 2 is going pretty well so far.  It's a Friday, so I've already made a plan to just stay home and play video games tonight instead of going out (don't want or need the temptation).  I'm not having very many cravings, but I know my bad days are usually 3 and 4, so I'm trying to brace myself for that.  

It's really hard feeling like I can't socialize without smoking.  I want to make whatever sacrifices I have to to quit, because it's one of the most important things in my life right now, but I also just want to be able to enjoy my weekend with my friends.  I know myself well enough to know I don't have the discipline to do so, and I want to succeed this time, so I guess I just need to suck it up for a while and make a few sacrifices! 

Anyone else going through this struggle right now? How are you coping?

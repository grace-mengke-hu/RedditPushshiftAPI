I'm back...day 4...little embarassed...rdy to join the "not going to smoke today" club ;)

So about 10 months ago I quit...for about 2 or 3 weeks.  I learned a lot and am now ready to try this again.  Getting over a cold (my fears about breathing spurred me to quit)...so today is day 4.

Today will be first hard day...I'm recovered enough from cold that smoking doesn't gross me out....and my alcoholic husband is drinking today...and smoking is my coping mechanism for the binge drinking.  (Note - I'm NOT blaming him for my smoking  - smoking is my habit and my issue to deal with).

I'm a little embarrassed cuz the last time I tried quitting, I jumped in wholeheartedly into this subreddit.  I started off active...it waned as life got busy...and I disappeared when I stopped working at not smoking.  BUT...I ain't letting a little embarrassment stop me from coming back.  I want to use all the tools I can. And I know it can take a lot of people many tries.

So hello again.  Here's to making it a SUCCESSFUL day 4.

I know there's a lot of you not smoking today.  I want to join the "club" and not smoke today ;)

Thanks for listening ;)

So It begins.

This year I'm not going to smoke a single god damn cigarette. You know why?  
  
It's slowly killing me.  
It makes me smell like shit.  
It fucks up my teeth.  
All my friends hate it.  
I can't enjoy a movie for an hour before I have to pause.  
My sex drive is low.  
I can't smell anything anymore.  
It makes my car smell terrible.  
My grandfather died from it.  
It's trashy.  

Cheers to you guys. I've been smoking a pack a day for the last 4 years and today I'm done with this shit. I'm going to invest in gum and sunflower seeds. I promised the woman I love that I'd quit, and I need to stick to my word. I'll probably be posting in here quite a bit, so please don't get sick of me. I love you dudes. Thanks in advance for the support.  
  
HAPPY NEW YEARS!

Over 9 months quit and had to overcome the stress of 2 miscarriages

I quit smoking about 2 weeks after I found out I was pregnant the first time. 2 weeks after I quit smoking I lost the baby. I don't know how or why but I still didn't cave in and start smoking again.

I guess I looked at it like "the pregnancy wasn't going to be for nothing". 

Then I got pregnant again - lost again. Vicious cycle of loss. And yet I still haven't picked up a cigarette.

I'm pregnant again now and I'm super scared. More scared than I was the second go around. But I can promise you this : I'm so damn proud that I don't have to worry about quitting smoking again.

Stress city! Vent

Just started and had to remove my badge. As soon as I settle in, some stupid crap pops off! Been telecommuting to move out of state for the past two months. Informed her when she asked months ago that I needed 8/1-8/3 at the latest. With a week to the move date, she informs me that the property will not be ready until the 14th. Now I have to pray I can extend my notice in my current rental and pay half a months rent and I just want to scream. I'm so mad, I'm shaking!! Luckily, my moving truck reservation change didn't change my quote, and the silver lining may come in the form of a few more paychecks to save, but as of this moment, I'm furious, and I gave in because I have no self control at all! Hopefully when I reset my badge tomorrow, it will actually count for something :( I feel so discouraged.

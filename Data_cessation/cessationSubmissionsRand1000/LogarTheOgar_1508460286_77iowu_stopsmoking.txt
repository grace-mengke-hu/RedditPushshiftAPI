Compulsion for Consumption

Ahh the dreaded 18-day reset. It seems each time I "quit" I start off with more and more confidence, but always reach a specific feeling that I can't figure out what it is and it just breaks me.

It's really strange. I suddenly have this compulsion that I need to consume something to "feel better." I'll start to have a bad day and I'll think "I just need a..." and I'll be better.

I think it's because I'm so used to using cigarettes to regulate my mood that now once I get past a certain point when I start to get stressed or something, my brain naturally says "well just put something in your body that'll fix it."

Problem is, I do, and I came home and ate EVERYTHING and then got all stressed because broooo the calories though. And then on the way to someones house I bought a pack and now I'm back on day one. I woke up with a splitting headache and was like no fucking way dude.

UGH, anyone got any cheat codes?

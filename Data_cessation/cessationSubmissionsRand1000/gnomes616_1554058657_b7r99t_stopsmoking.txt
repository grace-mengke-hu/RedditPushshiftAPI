Lots of dreams about smoking lately

Hi r/stop smoking

Among many of my anxiety dreams, including zombies and being randomly fired from my job, include some instance in which I start smoking again and then put off quitting because it was so awful to go through the first time.

I quit in July 2014, so having these nightmares crop up periodically after almost 5 years leaves a lot of anxiety waking up. 

Luckily, it's still just nightmares. Me and the husband are still both thoroughly and happily quit.

Anyone else want to share your smoking nightmares?

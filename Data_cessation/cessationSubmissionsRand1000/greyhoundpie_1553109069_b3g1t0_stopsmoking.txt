17 days smoke free. Been on the path for 21 days. Didn't put one on yesterday and today and I feel fine. Safe to quit?

Hi friends.

I get the patches for free so money is not an issue. I'm only on step 2 (14 mg) and still have 23 weeks of my patch program to go. What do you guys think? Should I just stop wearing it if it works of is it beneficial for me to stick with the schedule and probably go to step 3?

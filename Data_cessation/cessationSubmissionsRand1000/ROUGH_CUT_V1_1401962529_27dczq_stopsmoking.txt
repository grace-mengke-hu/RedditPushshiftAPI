Lung healing... feels strange

I stopped 6 days ago, it’s not my first attempt, I’ve been an intermittent regular smoker over the years = months of daily smoking, then stop for months, pick it up again.  My lungs… they feel really weird.  I especially notice it while I’m sleeping, like something is happening in there, and it disturbs me and wakes me up in fear, “Have I completely demolished my lungs? Is this ever going to feel normal? Is cancer growing in there?”  It’s not pain exactly, it feels like mutations (for lack of a better word) that changes locations now and then plus a a moist/charred feeling when I breathe in and out, like I still have smoke residue in my lungs as though I smoked within the last few hours.  Been coughing more lately than the first few days.  Can anyone relate?  Can anyone shed light on when lungs will feel normal again?  Would some running and cardiovascular exercise help or simply exacerbate the feeling?  I’ve been doing about 10 mins a day of at home exercises.  Anything dietary or vitamin supplement recommended?

I'm afraid to quit.

On October 1, 2014, I made a big stink to my friends about quitting. I declared confidently that I'd simply never buy, smoke, or want another cigarette again. Yeah, okay. It's May and I still haven't. I came close in February, when I was on vacation for 2 weeks. But the day I came back I bought a pack and immediately smoked all of it. Every cigarette I've had since October has been a little blow to my confidence and made me feel more distant from my goal. And then I realized that I'm simply terrified of quitting. Smoking has been a daily part of my life since I was 19, and I'm 26 now.

Maybe someone else can relate to this, but I believe smoking has actually increased my anxiety. I have to start off, take breaks during, and finish literally ANY activity with smoking. It's like smoking is interwoven into everything I do, which basically sums up how addicted I am. If I don't have that, like, coexistence with smoking and [enter activity here], I feel isolated, or scared, or even nervous. Going about my day without smoking at all, like today actually, makes me feel like I'm treading water. Or like I'm holding my breath and a cigarette in my mouth is the oxygen tank that keeps me alive. I'm going through insane nicotine withdrawal as I write this in my office at work, but I can't be afraid of this anymore. What is it I'm afraid of? Feeling light-headed and irritable? NOT feeling that all-too-familiar rectangle in my pocket? Driving with the windows up because there's no smoke to let out? These tiny minor changes are at first really petrifying, but I think we've all been there. Does anyone else have that initial fear? What did you do about it? Thanks for reading my withdrawal-induced rant.

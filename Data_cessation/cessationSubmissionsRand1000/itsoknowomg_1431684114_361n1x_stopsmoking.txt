Hey there

So its 5 months already and i thought ill share some insight also. After 4 months it was Hard and i went to buy vaporizer without nicotine and i used it two days... after that i really had little to no problems, now i just keep it in case but dont smoke it or i have desire... Thanks for all the support, lets not smoke today, good luck :) 


Edit : wrong month count

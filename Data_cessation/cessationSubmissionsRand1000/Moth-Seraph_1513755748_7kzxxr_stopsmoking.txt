Switched to vaping

I know I only traded forms of addiction. But vaping seems better. I'm still struggling with controlling the weight I'm gaining, and I think my breathing problems are weight related. BUT I tried to smoke a cigarette the other day and choked on in and threw it away. But there's no more smokers cough and I'm so happy to be rid of the filth of ashes. My apartment is finally smelling better.

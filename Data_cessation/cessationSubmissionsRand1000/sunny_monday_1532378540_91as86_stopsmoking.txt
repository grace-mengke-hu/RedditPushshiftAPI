Why does quitting make me want to cry?

Seriously.. I am not a crier. This is the 3rd? 4th? time this year I am attempting to quit, and.... again, I want to bawl my eyes out. Not because I miss cigarettes, or for any reason in particular. I am just weepy. 

This happens every time I quit. If this a physical withdrawal response or is my brain just messing with me?

More success when I don't keep track -- just a thought

I'm the sort of person who if I tell myself I'm on a diet and start counting calories/pounds I will without fail go spectacularly off the wagon. And after a dozen or so quitting attempts, I've realized that, for me at least, it's the same with smoking. 

Usually I download a quit app and check it several times a day to keep myself on track, but that has not worked at all. I'll slip up and then smoke a whole pack before I know it and then stress over having to reset the app and start all over. This time around, I decided to go without the app (I do have my badge here but that hasn't been setting off my self-sabotage alarms as I only check in here rarely) and have had much more success. 

The trick for me seems to be learning to not think about it -- both with dieting and smoking. The more I focus on it the less successful I am. Just a thought -- I hope you find this helpful.

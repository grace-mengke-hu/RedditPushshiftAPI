I'm officially depressed.

Ok, maybe not officially but, fuuuuck. I've been really trying to sound and actually be positive about this whole thing. I'm not even off the nicotine. I'm vaping the shit out of my ecigarette. I want to be happy about this. This is something I want to do. 

I have essentially hated everything since I quit. Which is normal quitting behavior for me. I've been mean. Grumpy. Rude. A general asshole to everyone including my own family. 

Over the last couple days it has evolved into zero interest in doing anything except crying.  I don't want to go anywhere, clean anything, care for my own kids. I just want to sit on the couch or lay in bed and do nothing at all.

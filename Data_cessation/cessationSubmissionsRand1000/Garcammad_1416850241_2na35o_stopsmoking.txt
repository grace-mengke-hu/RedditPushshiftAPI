40 days! Went to 0 nicotine on my vape today...

First of all, I can't believe it's been 40 days! With that said, I've been cutting back on my nicotine, from 6mg for the past 3 weeks to 0mg today. This is either stupid idea doing this at the stress of Thanksgiving, or a good idea doing this at the stress of Thanksgiving because I'll (hopefully) be too busy to think about it. 

However, going to 6mg (started at 12mg) really didn't affect me that much. A couple days of dizziness and a little brain fog but I was fine other than that. We shall see! Stay strong quitters!

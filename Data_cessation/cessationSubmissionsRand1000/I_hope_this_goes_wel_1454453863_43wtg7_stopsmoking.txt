This has been the best year of my life. And it will be for you too.

A year ago I smoked my last cigarette. Actually 3 cigarettes. I recorded myself smoking my last one and saved it to my phone. I had a tendency to get drunk with friends and cave so I figured if I made a message to my future, potentially weak, self I would be able to prevent another mistake. I did read Allen Carr's book.... 4 times. But you know what? I never quit trying to quit. I can't count the amount of times I caved. 3 days... "too stressful." 1 week... "we all die anyways." 3 weeks... "my family likes me more when I smoke." 2 months.... "Just. One. Cigarette."

Your brain is going to try to trick you. Don't let it. There may be a lot of things in this world that you simply cannot control. But your thoughts, attitudes, and emotions are the only thing you can. 

Never, never, never forget your why. Why are you quitting? Why *did* you quit? Why do you ~~want~~ **need** to quit? 

What needs to happen for you to look back on this current year and say with 100% certainty, "This has been the best year of my life"?

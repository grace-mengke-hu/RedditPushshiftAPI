Relapse after 44 hours mostly because of this forum

I post bout quitting looking for support and maybe get 1 reply. It's not this boards  fault my wife wouldnt get up except to tell at me that Iam acting crazy.......... she told me to go smoke. It's not her fault

I called my dad and he told me to go smoke

Idk Ihave problem with depression and Ithink quitting smoking is just gonna push me to the edge. My blood pressure off nicotine this afternoon was the highest it's been in a year... there's no relief in sight. My life is fuckinuseless. I am one fight away w mu wife from bein homeless .... 

Does it really matter if I smoke if the rest of my life is so fu king shitty????

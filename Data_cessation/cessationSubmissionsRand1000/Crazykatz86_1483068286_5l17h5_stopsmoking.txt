Had a setback today is day 1 again

Yesterday after working an intense overnight shift I had to see a doctor in reference to some medical problems that I've been having.  As the specialist that my doctor was on the phone with was talking about my signs and symptoms I could unfortunately hear the specialist on the other end.  My doctor was quite convinced that I was experiencing a pretty drawn out benign medical problem and was just doing the consult due to length of symptoms.  The specialist I could hear says fro my doctor there is no way that is possible your patient has a brain tumor. Thankful for good insurance I proceed to have bloodwork drawn and spend 40 agonizing minutes in an MRI machine.  I then proceed home where my husband who has been unemployed for about a year now initially due to lack of work in his field followed by medical issues of his own had gotten a phone call for his first promising job interview in a while.  I was trying to stay off drinking in addition to the smoking but for some reason waiting on the results of my brain scan it just seemed like a fairly good time to drink.  And I guess we  all knew where it went from there.  I had two cigarettes.  Got my test results today and while I am dealing with some medical issues I do not have a brain tumor!  I am a bit upset to be back on day 1 but I made it through no smokes today and trying hard not to beat myself up to bad over the relapse.  Sorry for the really long post.

A day 4 rant. Transitioning into a new phase of withdrawal

Anyone who's quit and relapsed before can probably understand my own bewilderment about why I put myself into this position again.

Quitting cigarettes is aweful in the short term. It feels so horrid. 

My eye has stopped twitching at this point. That "itch" to smoke is mostly gone, I've finally stopped constantly touching my face like a weirdo. I'm getting a little more calm....

But my thoughts are cloudy. My mood volatile. My hunger levels are up and down, and the INSOMNIA. I struggle with sleep problems even without quitting, but last night I could not sleep even with sleeping pills.

It's cool, I know this all passes. Let this be a reminder to myself why cigarettes are so horrid. 

On the bright side, I'm breathing easier already, I feel generally healthier, my sense of smell and taste is slowly coming back.  I don't feel like I'm going to die when I go to the gym anymore, after just a few days!

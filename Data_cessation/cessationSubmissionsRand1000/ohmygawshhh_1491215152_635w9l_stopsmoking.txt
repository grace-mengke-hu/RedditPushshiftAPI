I'm a lurker, I want to stop, I know I can, I've stopped in the past. Plus facial changes?

Hey Guys! 
I really want to quit smoking, I've been two weeks alcohol free and I want to completely flip my life and get rid of all the bad stuff, except for maybe chocolate (Please let me have one vice) lol. 
I am still trying to organise a quit date. So I wont apply for a badge yet, but does anyone have any advice for me on this? 
And can anyone tell me about the changes they've noticed in their skin and faces? Not that I'm quitting purely for vanity, Its also sending me broke lol! 
P.s good on you all for being quitters! :)

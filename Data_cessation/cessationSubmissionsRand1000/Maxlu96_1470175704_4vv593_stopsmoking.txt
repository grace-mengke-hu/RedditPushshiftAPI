What can I do to help my lungs?

Hello,

I quit smoking 73 hours ago. I started when I was 15, that was nearly 5 years ago. Ive smoked around 30 cigarettes a day, but it got heavier and heavier on my body. I could feel it degenerate every day, my lung burning, always out of breath. Unable to do sports, gaining absurd amounts of weight. This sunday, I had a sudden moment of epiphany. I was outside smoking when I felt a very bad pain in my chest. I threw the cigarette away half-smoked and decided that very moment I was going to quit.

It is difficult, but I am more than willed to go through this. I want a healthy body, a pretty one, I want to do sports and feel good again. I did not smoke in the last 73 hours and even being near smokers grosses me out because the desire to be healthier is so big. I cant even smell it anymore. But I was wondering what I could do to help my lung regenerate. I know it is near total destruction, but I want to help it get the toxines and mud out.

What can you suggest?

In big support of your desire to quit:
Max

Forgot how long its been since I last smoked

I actually forgot how long its been since I've smoked last until I really thought about it. I haven't been thinking about it much, and when I do think about it, its in a negative light.

I had a busy couple of days helping a friend move, and got really pissed off at two of my friends who said they'd quit with me but didn't.. One was the friend that was moving and ohhh the stress of buying a house... The other friend had no excuse. 

I was angry for an entire minute until,  while carrying a chair to the truck through a cloud of smoke, the anger turned to pity. How unfortunate for friend #1 that not only did he have the stress of moving, but now he'd have the stress of nicotine withdrawal in a few hours. How unfortunate for friend #2 that he'll have to kick withdrawals again to quit and stay quit, or otherwise just remain a smoker. 

And I, with my newfound cardio stamina, had no need for a "smoke break" although I did feel taken advantage of since I did most of the carrying of things....  Lazy shits.

And then again I was hit with the pity and now, a self esteem boost. No more will I be judged or looked down on for being lazy, weak, or just an ass. Not disrespectful for smoking near someone's open car window or front door, not smelly or unpleasant to stand close to... 

These were my inner thoughts while I helped my friend move, and not a foul word did I mutter about my friends who didn't have it to stay quit with me this week.

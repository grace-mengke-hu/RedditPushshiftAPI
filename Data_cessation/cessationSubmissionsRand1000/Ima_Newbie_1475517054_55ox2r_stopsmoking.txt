Over 50 days smoke-free. Occasional cravings. Never want to go back!!!

So I haven't posted in a while, but I'm still going strong. Coming up on two months smoke-free!

I haven't gained weight this time, like in the past. I attribute this to being on a low-carb diet (which I was already on for a few months prior to quitting smoking.) I just don't have the food cravings this go-round, which I am thankful for. I have actually lost 4 more pounds since I quit!

Yes I still have cravings. They are irritating and short-lived. I do not actually want to light up a cigarette. I just crave what it represented to me... a break to contemplate, a reward, an act of motivation (ie: I'll smoke a cig then I'll vacuum.) Yeah I know I can still 'take a break' or 'reward myself,' it just takes time to erase the thought of smoking from the mind totally I guess.

To clarify... I do not want to and do not intend to smoke. I'm just weighing in on the fact that occasional irritating cravings do still pop up. I hate it, but it is what it is.

Be strong, folks!!!

It has been a tough day today.

And I don't even know why.

I've been sitting here most of the day doing school work, studying and listening to some relaxing music. For some reason, I've had craving after craving, almost as if I could smell it, taste it again. After one craving passes, another follows a few minutes later. I don't want one, but my body is saying otherwise for some reason today. I'm approaching my three month mark, I'm not giving up now.

For no reason at all, it's just a bad day.

Hang in there quitters.

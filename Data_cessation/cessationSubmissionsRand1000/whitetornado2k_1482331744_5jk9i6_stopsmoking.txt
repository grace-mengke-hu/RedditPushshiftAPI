Smoking in my dreams...

Good morning, fellow non-smokers!

The last few nights I have been smoking in my dreams. In the dreams, when I realize I'm smoking, I immediately put out the cigarette and I feel super ashamed of myself. I remember saying "Dammit! Now I have to start all over again!"

When I wake up, I have no cravings to smoke, thankfully! I've gone over 100 days now with no setbacks, so it's really weird that I'd all of a sudden start dream-smoking 3 nights in a row. 

Has anyone else experienced this? If so, how long did it last?

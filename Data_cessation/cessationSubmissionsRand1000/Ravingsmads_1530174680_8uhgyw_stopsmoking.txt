A message to the younger smokers. Cancer isn't a reason for quitting!

Sent this message to a young 17 y/o redditor and I thought it will be of use to the other youngsters here. (I'm only 22 myself).

Fuck health, fuck living til 105 shitting and pissing in a bag, fuck not getting cancer because it will probably be cured by the time we are 50 anyway.

Here is the real reason why I quit smoking :

You will smell like shit, girls will be disgusted. You will have to leave your friends and go smoke when you guys are in non-smoking areas. Watching cinema will suck, going to malls will suck, flying will suck, and those things will suck more and more in the future as the world is becoming more anti-smoking.

Furthermore, you won't be able to go hiking with friends, you won't be able to go swimming for extended periods. Your twenties will feel like your thirties and your thirties will feel like your forties. Also, you will get tired having sex and start panting like a dog. Chicks aren't impressed by that. Imagine being tired after 30 seconds of humping,  trust me it FUCKING SUCKS!

Also, you can use your quit to your advantage, I'm learning to coal draw ATM. I use my cravings to do something productive instead and get a natural shot of dopamine.

I'm underweight so I either eat, draw or exercise when the cravings hit. I'm accomplishing more after I quit smoking than I did in months before I quit.


So here, those are some reasons that you might actually give a fuck about. Let me know what you think, and if you do decide to quit let me know and we can keep each other accountable if you want.

Just remember: Not one puff, no matter what. As each puff when you try to quit will feel way better which will reinforce the addiction ten-folds in your brain. Your brain will be like "oh, now I know why I used to like this thing, better reinforce it so we don't go on extended periods without it again".

So yeah, Cancer and health issues weren't why I quit.

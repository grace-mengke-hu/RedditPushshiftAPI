I give Smoking a lot of Credit for this...

I have grown to hate and resent smoking so much, I feel that in the process I have neglected to give smoking proper credit for All of the Good it actually did for me!

Allow me to make amends, right now.!~

Smoking should get credit for relieving the symptoms that it created.
That's actually ALL that SMOKING does for us addicts!!

1. We smoke

2. We become addicted

3. We get withdrawl feelings because of smoking

4. We smoke to relieve the feeling we got because of withdrawl, from smoKing

5. That is EVERYTHING smoking does for you!

Does nothing for stress, guilt relief, concentration, people dying, parents busting chops, people dumping or rejecting you, job losses, pet losses, boredom, decision making,  etc....

Get a grip on that and quitting becomes easier!!

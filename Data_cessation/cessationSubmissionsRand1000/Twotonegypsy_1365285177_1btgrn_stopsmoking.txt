I got drunk last night

But I didn't smoke.  I actually didn't even think about smoking.  I walked pass these two older men smoking and it smelt like shit to me.  I did not want to be like them, a slave to nicotine.  And I wasn't!

All of us can do this!  Five years of smoking and the only thing I have to show for it is... nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  Well, nothing positive at least haha.  There is no reason to give in.  There is no reason to go back to being short of breath everyday.  We have everything to gain from not being addicted to cigs:  Life.

Day 2 coming to a close

So, as the title says, I'm almost at the end of day 2. I'm losing my mind.   I took a 3 hour nap today because I felt like shit. But, the craziest thing is that I want to cut myself. As a teen, before I started smoking, I self-harmed.  I would essentially black out and wake up with cuts on my arms when I was under extreme stress.  It stopped when I started smoking. 

I've noticed my irrational anger and depression is back. I see a blade and dragging it over my skin comes to mind. Obviously I self medicated with smoking. I know I need to see someone.  But, how do I get through the next few weeks?  I don't think I'll hurt myself.

My SO is pissed at me right now because smoking "has been on my mind a lot lately".  I snapped at him. He's one of those people that can just stop smoking and never smoke again.

I realized smoking was the only real thing I have for myself.  That's another reason this sucks. 

Sorry for being all over the place. That's just where my mind is today.

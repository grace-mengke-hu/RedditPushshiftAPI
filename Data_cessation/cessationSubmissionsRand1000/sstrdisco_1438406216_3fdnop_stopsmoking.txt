100 days!

I can't believe how terrified I was to quit smoking. I was afraid of feeling withdrawal symptoms forever, and always panicking because I'd never smoke again, and a million other nonsense things. Bottom line, I feel great! Smell and taste are returning for me; I don't stink; the nicotine stains are fading from my teeth; my shampoo smells great; my perfume is lovely; my clothes smell clean; the faded cigarette smell is gone from my house; I'm not kept up at night with smoker's cough; I don't sound raspy and horrible in the morning; my voice isn't as low pitched as it was; I've got extra scrilla; I'm not hiding a horrible secret from my family anymore! One of my favorite things is being able to breath! I don't feel like a heart attack waiting to happen, I'm not scared that I can't ever catch my breath. My other favorite thing is I feel more active and motivated to be active. At some point, I enjoyed being physical and the older I got the more I smoked and I just stopped. Now I'm exploring sports I never thought possible. And! I don't feel tied down to anything. With my nicotine addiction, it was always about, "Where can I go that I can smoke and that won't take too long so I don't have to go long without a smoke?" That chain is broken. My husband is super proud of me! My friends are super proud of me! I'm sure if my cat could speak, he'd tell me he's super proud of me!

An addict is never out of the woods, but this has gotten easier and I am grateful. Thank you to this subreddit and the wonderful people here who have supported me. You're lifesavers <3

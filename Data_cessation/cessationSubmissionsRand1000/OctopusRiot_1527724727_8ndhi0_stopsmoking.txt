I made my mind up while standing in line

I had finished my last cigarette and was gonna stop to buy another pack. Well the guy in front of me took forever. During that time, I looked at all of the prices for cigarettes and realized that this is crazy. I’m a broke college kid trying to afford these things. And I’m going to school to be a teacher! I can’t smoke and be a teacher! 

So I bought gum instead of cigarettes. Wish me luck!

Hello!! (Again?)

I think ive posted here before during my past attempts to quit. So if I have a badge, its wrong. I cant seem to fix it on my phone though. Anyways!

I quit smoking today, I'm using the patches and unlike the other times today actually went okay. Before I would just sit on the couch thinking about how I couldn't smoke. But today when that started up I got up and did the dishes, it helped a lot. There's even like half a pack sitting on my kitchen table (my SO smokes) and I barely paid any attention to them. I am super proud of myself. I know ive got a ways until I'm out of the woods but it would be cool to get some ideas on healthy stuff to snack on and keep myself busy. I have plans to get some sugar free cinnamon gum. I was wondering if there was anything else that will help take the edge off!!

To be honest I'm not actually supposed to chew gum because it makes my tmj flare up and usually ends up in a lot of discomfort, so if anyone knows of some good gum alternatives I would appreciate it!

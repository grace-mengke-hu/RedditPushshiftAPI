Day 3. Advice on going out to a bar with smoking friends.

I smoke from at least half a pack a day to possibly two when I go out drinking. The last cigarette I had was Tuesday around 11:30 at night. It has been a weird experience so far. Wednesday I preemptively took some ibuprofen to combat the headaches at work. Luckily it was a slow, low stress day. Yesterday I had school, luckily it is a non smoking campus so I didn't see or smell anything... So it has been fairly easy, so far. I have not really had crazy urges, its just been sitting in the back of my head that having a cigarette would be the best thing in the world, like all day/everyday " go have a smoke it will be fantastic". I just say no, but then the voice in the back of my mind comes and asks me five mins later... I haven't used patches,gum, pills just an increase in caffeine. So any help on staying strong on day three while drinking and hanging out with friends that smoke? 

UPDATE: Ended up being a very low key night. Played a few games of pool, and thats about it! The hard part started after I got home. Too early to be home on a friday night and super bored. I have been keeping occupied by listening to the songs that redditors suggested that the astronaut play in space from the thread on the front page...Its not helping much, very close to saying "efff it" out of pure boredom.

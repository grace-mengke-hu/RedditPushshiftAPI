No more hiding

So for the past month I have been hiding from the world. Today I made it past 2 big hurdles. I went to my parents for a garden planning session. It felt odd not to step out for a cig. Its the first time I've been there since I quit. After I left there I went to my first bonfire since quitting. People were smoking and it didn't bother me. The smell didn't piss me off and I didn't want one at all. It felt refreshing, like freedom. I know that its not over. That I can't let down my guard. But Damnit this feels like freedom... And freedom feels fantastic. I'm so happy to be a non smoker today.

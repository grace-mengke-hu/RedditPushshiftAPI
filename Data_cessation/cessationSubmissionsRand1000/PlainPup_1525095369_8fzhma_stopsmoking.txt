Smoke filled dreams

It’s been almost 3 months now since I’ve stopped smoking. Occasionally I’ll have a dream that smoking becomes a necessary thing to do because of the plot. I always end up rolling myself two cigarettes in the dream before I can move on to the next thing in it.

Interestingly enough, when I wake up not only do I think for about 30 seconds that I have smoked but I can taste it as well. It’s awful! It tastes like I ate an ashtray at some point in my sleep.

Is this my body pushing out the last of the garbage that is left over in my lungs? Or is it just my brain just making the taste up?

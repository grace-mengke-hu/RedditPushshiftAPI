45 days without smoking!

Cold Turkey is going well here - but I've just been hit with a cold and a nagging cough that feels like a smoker's cough and like its related to the quit. 

It started out as my ears feeling blocked about a week a go and eventually felt like a full blown cold, but now seems to have settled as a cold and a cough just sitting in my chest nagging me. Is this still the body cleansing itself of 14 years of stupidity? Any tips on how to fast track through it? 

All of you quitting out there, well done! And keep going!

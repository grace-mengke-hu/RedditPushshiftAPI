9 Days ago I posted this..

"still smoking, still hating myself! went a few days again, only to buy cigs.. again. I've tried for so many months now. I quit in May for 3 months with Allen Carr and it's just not working, I've also read "freedom of nicotine" and that isn't working either, the funny thing is, is that I know smoking is bullshit, but the anger, dread and hatred I get after a few days smoke free, always drives me back... Urgh, running out of ideas"

and now, i'm currently 106 hours smoke free :) (didn't even know it was that long until i just checked my app!) and i'm doing fine. Pretty angry and ratty the first 2/3 days to be fair, but I feel a lot better now, the last 36 hours have been pretty fine. Everything I posted previously was just rubbish excuses. Good luck everyone, stop making excuses like I did, no better time than right now! Every time I set a "quit date" it made it infinitely harder. The "just one more fag" does not exist, it's a lie and you all know it! I want to beat my record of 86 days... I can do it. Oh and I've quit cold turkey.

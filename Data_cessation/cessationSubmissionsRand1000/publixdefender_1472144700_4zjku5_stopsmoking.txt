Thoughts on Cigars?

I have almost hit the 200 day mark (sans I did smoke a couple cigs after a big fight a couple weeks back with my SO but didn't get back on the wagon and even have fought a couple really tough cravings afterwards but kicked its ass so I considered it a victory and left my badge as is)

I was wondering what are the thoughts on having a cigar on occasion. I enjoy having some adult beverages and smoking cigarettes was always something that went along with this. Now that I have been smoke free and can have drinks and not be tempted to smoke cigs, what harm can come (aside from the obvious of mouth cancer and the nastiness that is smoking) from having a stogie to mimic the motion of smoking but not inhaling or catching a tru nicotine buzz?

Any thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated!

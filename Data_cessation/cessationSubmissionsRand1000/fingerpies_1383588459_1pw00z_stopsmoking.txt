Weird victory!

First, I have 34 days smoke free. Which is AWESOME. :)

Today I was cleaning my apartment, and found a rolling machine and cigarette holder. I opened it up found cigarettes and immediately went "ew!" and threw them away without even thinking. 

It was such an exciting moment that I wanted to share it!

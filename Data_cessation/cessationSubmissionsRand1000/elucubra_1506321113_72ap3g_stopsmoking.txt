I have quit. This time is it. I made a few false starts for a few months, but this time, re-reading Carr's book has made me commit much stronger.

Throughout the summer I've been half assedly quitting, often going a few days before relapsing.

I've fully quit a few times, and then started back, months or years later, for the stupidest reason, hating the smell and taste, and knowing I'd regret it. 

This time I started reading Carr's book while smoking, as I had done before, and halfway through, and three cigarretes in, I put the last one out. 

It's been three days. Nice smelling days. Not-having-to-run-outside-every so-often days. Not worrying-about-having-enough-filth-sticks-to-last-me-the-night days. 

Very few pangs, and those quickly quashed by my brain. 


I'm on my way.


Carr's book works for me.

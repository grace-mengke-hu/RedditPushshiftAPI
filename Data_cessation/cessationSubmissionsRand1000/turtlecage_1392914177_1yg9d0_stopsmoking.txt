First time being sick since I quit

I quit on August 25th and I am sick for the first time since then. 

I'm so grateful not to be smoking! I can't imagine this sore throat and stuffed sinuses being filled with tobacco smoke. I remember getting sick while I was still smoking and how I would continue to smoke cigarettes and not even enjoy it, in fact I would dread every cigarette. 
:) And I'll bet that my throat will bet better faster than it used to while I smoked.

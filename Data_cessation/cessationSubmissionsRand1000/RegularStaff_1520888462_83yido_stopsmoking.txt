reset my badge , sadface

reset my badge, my son fell in to the corner part of the door and cut his head open, was waiting for ambulance (looked worse than it was) and the nicotine monster took his chance and I caved as his mum was cuddling him. (i didnt just leave him to bleed, lol!) Counter is reset for tomorrow, but I need to be ready even if i get caught off guard. Was only day 2, but it saddens me that I have to start again. My son is doing fine, and will be having some steristrips applied.  Roll on tomorrow and I will beat this shit!

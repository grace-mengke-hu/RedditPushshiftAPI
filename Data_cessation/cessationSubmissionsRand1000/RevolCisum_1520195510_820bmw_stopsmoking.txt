26 years of 1 to 1.5 pack a day

I quit on Feb 28, but slipped up 2 days in.  I have PTSD and my nerves were buzzing.  Every sound or frustration was sending me out of my skin.  I was trying to quit cold turkey thinking of it like pulling a bandaid off fast.  But I was having to take benzos at night just to get any sleep.

So, I'm starting over.  I quit once a couple years ago for 9 months using nrt for only a week or 2 in the beginning.  I gained a ton of weight, have lost it all now, so, I'm prepared for that if it comes.  Weight is better than smoking and one thing at a time.

I'm starting over, starting today.  I am reminding myself of all the things I hate about smoking in hopes that I can switch my perception from "I am missing something I love" to "I'm getting rid of something I hate".  

Nicotine withdrawal is no fucking joke.  Especially,  I think, if you have any type of mental health issues.  It's been my go to coping skill since I was a teenager. At least, I've convinced myself of that even though I know it makes anxiety worse and I'm tricking myself.  

Cross your fingers for me, I need to get this done.  I'm running out of health and time and have already done so much damage to my body.

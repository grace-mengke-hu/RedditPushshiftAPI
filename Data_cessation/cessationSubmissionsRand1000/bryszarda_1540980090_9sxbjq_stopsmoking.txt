Lost my job yesterday and resisted to smoke

Dear guys,

I haven't been active on this sub before but I will really need your support these days.

I have tried to quit smoking for years and been changing quit date on my SmokeFree app a  thousand times.

Yesterday I lost my beloved job I was fully committed for and I thought I'm doing great at. I'm still shocked and in a feeling of deep injustice, but there's one thing I'm proud of - I resisted the crave at this very stressful moment. Actually I'm feeling more motivated than ever. Maybe it's a kick I needed to start being a person I wish to be and take back control of my life.

I'm enjoying my deep and steady breathing now and going to yoga classes today !

Keep your fingers crossed for me.

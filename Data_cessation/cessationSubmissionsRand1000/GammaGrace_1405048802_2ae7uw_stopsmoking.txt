Guys, I'm serious this time, OK?

I've been trying to quit for the past year. I've probably reset my badge on here at least 20 times. This time, though, I have some pretty good motivation. I just watched my sister die at the age of 43. No, it wasn't smoking related, but she did take her life for granted and pretty much let her health deteriorate. So, watching her waste away, all I could think was **I don't want to die young.**

I don't care if I lived to be 120 while smoking everyday. I want to stop being stupid. I don't lie to myself and say that smoking isn't bad for me. So I am very aware of the consequences of smoking. I'm sure the majority of smokers are. I'm tired of hurting myself. Tired of being a slave. Tired of people giving me shit about how I smell and look. 

It isn't about how long you'll live. It's about the quality of that life. It improves so much the instant you stop smoking. 

Anyways, it has only bee 72 hours and 12 minutes. I know the hardest part is yet to come. I feel so confident this time, though. I'm just tired of it. I know I have some hurdles to get past. Like drinking and not smoking. I'm kind of tempted to have a couple tonight, just to celebrate and get over it. 

Good luck to everyone else. We aren't alone and we don't need a cigarette to be our support system.

Cold turkey ain't for chickens and apparently I am one.

 A year ago I quit for 2 months using the patch, then lit up again (just to try it) shortly after I was done with step 3 and I'm sure you know where that led me. I have since tried going CT several times and always found a reason (usually quite lame) to light up again. I completely agree with the theory behind CT and that NRT simply delays that final break, but I need that crutch, that help. I just got home to find my box of patches from Amazon had arrived, and today I signed up for a smoking cessation class being offered at work starting on the 13th. I will check in here for inspiration. I wish there was a daily pledge here similar to the one on r/stopdrinking. There isn't, or at least I haven't seen one, so I will have to pledge to myself and the universe every morning.Or maybe my chickens.  Please send vibes o'strength. TY.

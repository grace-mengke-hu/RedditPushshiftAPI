Going home to smoke my Last Cigarette

I just finished Allen Carr's Easy Way over lunch, and I cannot wait to go home and smoke my Last Cigarette. I've been cutting back the last year, and thought that I was doing so much better, but after reading the book I realize that being a Special Occasion Smoker (ie not bringing cigarettes to work, only smoking at night during the week) was making me even more miserable than if I had been smoking a pack/day.  I'm really excited to become a non-smoker, and experience  all the good things it will bring. Whether it be tasting food in a new way, being less winded in the studio, or just having a clearer complexion, I am really looking forward to all the good things 2015 will bring.

Happy quitting, everyone!

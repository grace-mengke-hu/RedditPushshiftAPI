One month down, and you all are the only ones who know. Thanks for being so supportive.

I haven't told anyone I know that I'm trying to quit, not even my wife. They obviously know that I haven't been smoking when I'm with them, but I've been hesitant to say "I quit" to anyone. I'm not sure what it is, but too many times before I've declared to everyone that I've quit and then been embarrassed when I fell off the wagon. Does anyone else feel like this? 

Anyway, without the encouragement of friends and family, I've been turning to /r/stopsmoking, and you all are great. You have been a real help to me keeping motivated to add one day at a time to that count beside my name, and I'm grateful to you and proud of myself for making it one month.

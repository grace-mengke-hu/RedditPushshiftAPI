Thank you all...

Without all the great advice from you, fellow redditors, I'd never come this far. In the beginning, 300 days without smokes seemed like science fantasy, but now that I'm here, I can't wait for 600.

I was frequenting this sub and [whyquit](http://whyquit.com/) all the time when it was the hardest - then I almost forgot about it for months at a time, but I always came back either to remember what I fought or to encourage new quitters as best as I could to try and return some positive influence others had on me. 

Thing is, I realize that smoking is now out of my life, but that non-smoking really is like long-distance running and that I shall not forget how quickly I could be right back where I started.

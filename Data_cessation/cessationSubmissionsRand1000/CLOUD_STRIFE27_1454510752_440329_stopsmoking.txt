I got my smiley face today, it's been one year!

Hang in there everyone!  While it seems to be a daunting and seemingly impossible task, quitting smoking is VERY possible.  While I don't forget that I used to smoke, it gets easier and easier everyday to deal with.  

Stay strong and join me in not smoking today.

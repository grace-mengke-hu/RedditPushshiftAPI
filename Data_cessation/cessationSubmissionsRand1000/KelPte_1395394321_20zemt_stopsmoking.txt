Double star and thinking...

...why the heck didn't I quit sooner :) 

Day 60 is HUGE for me as pack-a-day smoker of 17 years but it all got quite easy after 3rd week. I still think about smoking once or twice per day, but mostly that's only a thought of type "Oh, I used to smoke in this situation! Well, so glad I don't anymore...". I still get an occasional "craving" maybe once per week where I imagine that lighting one would be nice, but these are also easily dismissed and are virtually NOTHING compared to those from first weeks.

I am starting serious running (>10km) again and am also training climbing harder than before and generally feel quite great. But now I also notice more than before how much damage smoking really caused me - I don't feel bad, but I can see that my lungs and throat are healing quite slowly and that they will take quite some time to get to normal. While I was still a smoker, I never paid any serious attention to my body and that's one more thing that was really bad about smoking. I was scared to face the fact that I'm damaging my body on purpose. Well, that changed! :)

All in all, I'm really really happy that I finally quit and that I'm successfull so far. It was not easy and nobody should expect it to be, but it's the road I'd gladly take again! I encourage you all to try or continue - it's worth it! 

[edit] Also, I really should thank to [no-bullshit whyquit](http://whyquit.com/) site which really helped to educate me and to all of you fellow redditors who encouraged me in times of crisis. You're the best! :) Be strong and see you in another month :)

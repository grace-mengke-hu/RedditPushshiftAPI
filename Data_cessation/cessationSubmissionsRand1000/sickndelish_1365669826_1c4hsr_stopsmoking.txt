33 days - 1000 cigarettes avoided!

It's really cool how as time goes by we quitters continue to get healthier and further from our last cigarette- regardless of whether or not we were paying attention. It's like a little bonus that makes everyday better than the last! 

On day 33 I'm still coughing up a little gunk now and then- feels good to get it out. Went to the dentist and got my teeth cleaned this week, then got some whitening paste and mouthwash. Teeth look better already.  More and more frequent moments of conscious peace and acceptance of where I'm at. Saved over 300 bones already. Wrote a 6 page essay today for my history class without taking a million breaks. I could go on and on

Can't wait to see what's coming next!

Stay strong fellow quitters- smoking is not the answer!

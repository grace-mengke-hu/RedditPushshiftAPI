59 days but an intense new wave of cravings

I've gone 59 days, cold turkey. I keep feeling more energetic and optimistic by the day. My body is showing all sorts of signs of physical recovery.

BUT over the past week or so a fresh and intense wave of cravings has hit me. I dream about smoking. I watch cigarette reviews on YouTube. I can't stop thinking about them. There's clearly no physical element to this anymore. It's purely psychological, and at its root is the -- wrong, terribly wrong, I know -- belief that there was something profoundly enjoyable about smoking that I am now missing out on.

Help.

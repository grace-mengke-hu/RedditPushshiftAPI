12 days, 21 hours and 6 minutes

I haven't posted on here since the day I quit, so I wanted to update you on my progress. Days 1, 2 and 3 were the worst days ever. I had a full-blown panic attack on day 2, right outside the gas station. I drove there to pick up a pack and somehow I was able to convince myself to drive away empty-handed. It was so tough! Once I beat the first three days, I gradually began to feel better. I still had cravings but I kept telling myself that I didn't want to go through days 1, 2 and 3 again; that was motivation enough to not give in. For those of you just starting out, just know that it does get better with time. I no longer get the crazy cravings. I've gone out to bars with friends that are smokers and I haven't felt the need, or want, to smoke. I'm energized and refreshed. I feel like I've overcome a huge obstacle and I am extremely proud of myself. You can get through this too. Hang in there. I believe in you!

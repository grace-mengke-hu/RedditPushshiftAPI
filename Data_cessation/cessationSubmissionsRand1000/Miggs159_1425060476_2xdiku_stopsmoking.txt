5th Day and I feel weird....

Yesterday was Day 4 and it was incredibly easy, my cravings were super super low and when I saw one I didn't even want it. However, I'm getting these weird feelings and thoughts throughout the day. 

1. This seems too easy to be true 
2. I dreamt about smoking 
3. It feels like I never smoked a cigarette in my entire life

Either way this is going really well and I am very confident in not smoking another cigarette for the rest of my life. Let me know what you guys think about those three things mentioned above they kid of freak me out. None the less thanks for the support!! You guys are awesome!!!!!

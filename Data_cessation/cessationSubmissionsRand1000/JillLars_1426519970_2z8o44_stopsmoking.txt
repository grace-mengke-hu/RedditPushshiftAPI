Woot! 1 Year!

I did it!  I made it 1 year!  This is officially my longest quit yet- previous record being 362 days.  With that being said, I know that my work will never be done.  I will always have to be vigilant and remember that I can't have "just one."  

For those of you early in your quit- just remember to do what works best for you.  I used an e-cig and lowered my nicotine gradually.  This allowed me to form new habits while tapering my use.  Now I am done with the e-cig completely and it wasn't even hard to give up- a few cravings here and there, but now I'm onto bigger and better things!  Good luck to you all, you can do it!

Am I sleeping better?? 

Its been a little over two weeks since I last had a smoke. I usually wake up anywhere from 2 to 5+ times a night. I feel like that has decreased drastically. IS this a thing or am I making shit up, I could be making things up, Idk. now that i think about it i woke up to turn over about three times last night.

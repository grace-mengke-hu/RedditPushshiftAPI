I just realized today is my fourth week cigarette-free!

This is insane. Yesterday I was extremely tempted to falter but I stayed strong. I drank plenty and was at a bar that was filled with smokers. It was really a difficult time for me but I managed.

Also, I haven't really used my vaporizer that I bought. I haven't used it more than twice this past week. It's one of those shitty Blu re-chargeable e-cigs and it stopped working properly after 2 of the tiny cartridges.

I feel good, guys. My throat almost feels like new!

I really have to thank this subreddit. It's always in the back of my mind when I think about smoking.

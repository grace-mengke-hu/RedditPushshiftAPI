3 things that helped

Just passed the 3-week mark and feeling pretty good.  Just wanted to share the 3 things that have helped most up to this point.

1. Acknowledging the addiction:
Accepting that I'm an addict, in the same way that some people get addicted to alcohol or illegal drugs, has helped me to treat the problem with the seriousness it deserves. And I know recognise that, just like any other kind of addict, just one taste of my particular poison will have me hooked again. I know this to be true, and realise that I will always be a nicotine addict, for the rest of my life. 

2. Water and chocolate:
I put a slice of lemon or lime (or both - woohoo!) into a refillable bottle of still water and carried it around with me. Being hydrated - and the vitamin C - helped flush the toxins, and the sharp flavour distracted from cravings.  Also, for a stubborn craving in the early days, a Riesen Chocolate Chew. The biter dark chocolate helped satisfy the taste for a cig, and the chewiness outlasted the craving.

3. This group:
I'm not big into social media, so when the Smokefree app told me to join this group, I was sceptical. But I've found nothing but support here. I've been able to be more honest here than I have been in real life sometimes, and it helps so much to know we're all in it together and supportive of each other. A week or so ago, I was so cranky and frustrated that I could have murdered someone, but people here talked me down - thank you!

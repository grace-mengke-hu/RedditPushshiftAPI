It's OK if You Can't Understand Life Without Cigarettes

If you're still smoking or recently quit and can't imagine what life is like as a non-smoker, you aren't alone.

I remember when I was still smoking I had thoughts like "what do people who don't smoke do at work all day. just sit and stare at the screen? what do they do for breaks?" Or thoughts like "how do you take a break after you finish a big project at home?"

Now that I have been smoke free for a year and a half I still can't tell you exactly what non-smokers do in these situations, but there is no void. Non-smokers don't struggle with sitting at a desk all day because they aren't going through cigarette withdrawl. And you don't need some "reward" after you finish a project around the house... you just live your life and you don't need these little rewards all day. You're just peaceful and happy and not anxious.

As a smoker you think you need a reward after everything you do because the reality is you are going through mini-pain-withdrawl the whole time you aren't smoking. And you sure as hell feel like you need some sort of reward after going through that for 45 minutes to an hour.

Sorry for the rambling but just had the realization and thought I would share.

Worthless butt under my shoe - F You

My dear friends: Fuck cigarettes. Wanting to make you ugly, and slow, and gray, and frail. Trying to cover your apartment with ash, your car with ash, your clothes with ash. Wishing you cancer and death and despair. Hoping to give you and your parents and your children and your lovers sickness and sadness and loss. Conspiring to take your money, and your choice, and your strength. Fuck cigarettes. 

Proud of you all. Just make it through a couple days. You got this.

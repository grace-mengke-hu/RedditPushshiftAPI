Day 16: the urges are real today

Y’all, I have been dreaming almost every night that I’m smoking cigarettes. It’s really rude of my brain to put smoking front and center because I wake up really wanting to smoke. The immense power of addiction is truly incredible. Nothing about smoking cigarettes is appealing, and yet I’ve been jonesing for a smoke all day. 

I am just trying to remind myself that I am stronger than those pathetic little cancer sticks and that my willpower grows every time I say no. 

Don’t quit quitting, quitters!

Had a dream about smoking last night

Just wanted to talk about this because it was such a weird dream! But kind of reassuring in a sense.

In the dream I wasn't actually smoking, I was just holding a cigarette, about to light it. Then I stopped myself, thinking what a waste it would be to throw away that great feeling I've had since I quit just for one smoke, and how easily I'd get addicted again.

Then I looked inside the pack and there was already one missing. Somehow dream-me just KNEW I had already smoked that one, so I had already failed at quitting. But my reaction wasn't 'oh well, then I might as well smoke this second one since I've failed already'. I was actually disappointed with myself, knowing I'd have to go through withdrawals all over again. Dream-me was immediately determined to not smoke again. 

I woke up with that feeling of regret in the pit of my stomach. When I realised it was a dream I was so relieved, lol. It's also kind of typical of my emotions during my quit so far: I'm not feeling a huge craving to smoke again. I'm mostly feeling anxiety over somehow losing control of myself and smoking again when I don't really want to - which is kinda what happened in my dream.

It's so weird that even in this fantasy world where I could literally do anything, I want to quit smoking so badly that I hate myself for relapsing and immediately quit again, lol.

Anyway, long story short: had a weird dream about smoking. Anyone else have those? Can anyone relate to that fear of losing control and giving in in a moment of weakness?

One Month 100% smoke and nicotine free after 20 years of smoking!

It didn't hurt that I got a nasty cold, but I quite 30 days ago.  I barely notice cravings.  In fact, I don't "feel" cravings as much as I think about the fact I used to smoke.  Especially when I still cough in the mornings.  Smoke smells horrific. I feel much better, but I'm still stuffed up.  Anyway, smoked for years, started 20 years ago.

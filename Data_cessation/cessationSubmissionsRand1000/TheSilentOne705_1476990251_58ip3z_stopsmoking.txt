Well, that lasted for a long while. [Restart]

So, yeah, long streak (over 200 days!), but it happened and I failed. Lots of reasons; no excuses. I know what happens when I go cold and just how I act, so it's just as well that I'm getting it over with so that my Day 2 happens right as my weekend begins.

Day 2 is my WORST part of the 3 Day cycle. I'm snappy when everything starts clearing out, and I don't want to inflict that on anyone else, but if it's a quiet day like today, I think I'll be OK.

So, as I finish my tea and get ready to go home for the evening, I'm going to remember one thing: constant vigilance. I need to find better ways to deal with the pressures that cause me to smoke. Luckily, I have friends that involve me in their projects (which helps a lot!).

Keep at it, all you awesome people!

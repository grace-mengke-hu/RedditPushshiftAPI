I always fail in the morning. What advice do you have to help me out when I wake up craving tomorrow?

Mornings are always when I fail. The first smoke after waking up was always the most precious to me, and I can only make it to about 10am before I cave and go buy a pack.

What are some things you did to prevent this?

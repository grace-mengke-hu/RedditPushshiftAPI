100 days! Make the decision everyday to stay a Nonsmoker. You got this.

If you had asked me a year ago if I would be a nonsmoker today, I would have said, "Fuck off". I was one of those guys. Smoking was my only guilty pleasure, and it was mine alone. 

I made the decision out of the blue to quit, not pressured by anyone or guilt tripped into quitting. I made the decision by myself for myself. 

I am humbled.

Thanks okes!
We all are nonsmokers! And we will keep it that way.

23 Days cold turkey. Last night I was high, and I was unable to think properly and wanted to smoke a cigarette. I almost convinced myself last night. Instead of smoking I ate hell lot of bad foods.I do not regret at all. I'm happy.But I need to stop getting high or drunk for at least first 3 months.

You got this! YES, YOU!!!

My 8 year anniversary of quitting smoking was July 1. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was someone who tried many times before I succeeded. Never give up. 

&amp;#x200B;

YOU CAN DO THIS!

&amp;#x200B;

Since then I have run 4 road marathons, RAN 50+ miles 2x, and am training for a 100 miler next year. Your body and health can recover and the time is now!

And for those wondering how I quit, it was a variety of things. I tried patches numerous times along with nicotine gum... hated both. I read part of that book everyone always talks about. I took the first 6 weeks of Chantix... that did the trick for a bit. When I finally quit for good in 2011 it was the tiny mint Nicorette lozenges and just being fucking done.

All those years I was a smoker I thought cigarettes were helping me with anxiety and were a way to relieve stress which in actuality being in constant withdrawal from nicotine is what was stressing me out!

My brain I telling me I can't do it.

I had 1 cigarette yesterday and I haven't had any today, having my vape is really helping me but I still have these time when I think about how great it will be going a whole day without a cigarette and know that I can do it. 

And then there's this part of my brain that tells me "you're going to have a cigarette today." I say (sometimes out loud if I'm by myself) "No, I'm going to try not to smoke one today." Then I get this knot in my stomach and the urge to smoke. 

Why is it so hard to fight that part of my brain? Like every one that I've had tastes worse than the last. I don't want to smoke another after I smoked the last but the urge is hard to fight!

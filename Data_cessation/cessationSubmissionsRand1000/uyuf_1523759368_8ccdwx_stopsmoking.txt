Always feeling cautious

This is my longest attempt at quitting that I've done thus far. In the past I've made it to milestones like 10 days, 2 weeks, three weeks, but that sense of satisfaction tended to slowly decline as I felt that I was "out of the woods" and no longer had anything to aim towards. What I realise now is that I wasn't even close to being free from smoking. 

I'm closing in on 50 days now, which if I went back a few months I'm sure I would have seen that as a very long period of cessation, but I still feel like I'm in the early stages. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm trying to stay as cautious as possible, as I know that although 40+ days may seem like a long time, something unexpected could happen that could tempt me to relapse. 

Not really sure what the purpose of this post is. I'm feeling great and happy with myself, cravings are pretty rare and minor, but I still deal with a great deal of fear that I could end up smoking again. But it's this fear that I love the most, as it motivates me to keep going.

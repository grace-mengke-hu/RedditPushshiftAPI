So many more dreams than I'm used to having!

So, six months ago, I was smoking about a pack and a half a day.  I drank fairly heavily at least a couple nights a week, and the nights I didn't drink I'd take a few doses of Nyquil.  This was status quo for... well, for quite awhile - months, at least, maybe longer.

About three months ago I switched from Nyquil to Nyquil Cough and finally to Unisom - decided the acetaminophen was a bad idea given my drinking, and discovered that the doxylamine succinate does a passable job of getting me to sleep all by itself.

Then, almost two months ago (!!!) I quit smoking cigarettes.  I still use nicotine (via a vape, I'm currently at 5mg after starting at 12mg) and I still drink a couple times a week, just not as heavily as I did before.

Anyway, in the past couple weeks, I've been noticing that I'm dreaming again.  It's been a long time since I've been aware of any dreams - years, I think - and somehow I've woken up with fragments of dreams several times in the past couple weeks.  Most of them, unfortunately, are bad dreams, but not all - and honestly, it's the fact that I'm aware of them at all that has me surprised.  Has anyone else experienced this??  I've changed so much in the past few months that it's hard to pin it on the smoking, but this just seemed like the right place to ask...

I'm back...

I went clean for a few months. Then a stressful job at a paper mill, where everyone was smoking, I started up again. So now its back to square one. 

The annoying thing is that I have done this so damn many times, I know exactly how this is going to process out. Day 1...pissed off at the world. Willing to punch a random baby for a smoke. 

Day 3 to Week 2- hacking up a fucking lung as my body gets ride of this shit. I will feel sick as a dog and utterly miserable. 

Week 3 to Month- Start feeling better. Feel like an ass for not doing this sooner. Then someone will smoke next to me and I will want to cry. 

I swear to fucking god quitting smack seemed fucking easier than this...

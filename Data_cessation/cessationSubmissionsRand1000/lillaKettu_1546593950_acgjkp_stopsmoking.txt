Day 6 - mixed feelings

So 6 days... tomorrow I will been smoke free for a week so I'm proud if that. 
I don't regret that I quit smoking but it's been two very hard days for me ( just bad luck i guess ) and the thought of never smoking again freaks me a little bit out.
I know I should just focus on one day at a time. 
I don't think I've had a single craving for two days, been going for long walks and I haven't touched sugar since new years so things are going well.
I just want to keep you all updated on this journey and be honest about my thoughts because even writing everything down helps me get my mind in order.
Also a little backstory: I'm 23 (F) and I smoked for 7-8years, I just quit one day, didn't really think too much of it, I just didn't want to buy any more cigarettes and I've just been without them ever since. I used to smoke around 1 pack a day and this is my third time quitting ( second serious time ) but this time I really feel confident I can do this .
How are you holding up ?

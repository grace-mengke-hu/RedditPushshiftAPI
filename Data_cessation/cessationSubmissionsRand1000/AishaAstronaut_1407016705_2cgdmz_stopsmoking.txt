Drunk and surrounded by smokers last night

And I didn't touch a cigarette! They even sold them in the pub we were in and I joked about it to my sister but I genuinely wasn't even considering doing it for real.
I sniffed the smell in quite deep when all the other girls lit up and immediately felt bad and disgusted by it. The initial smell seemed nice for a second and then it was just kinda gross and weird.
The odd thing for me is that I always liked the smell of smoke even before I was a smoker which is why the whole "it's disgusting" argument never worked on me. I quit for my voice (I'm a singer in a band) and the money more than anything. But yeah, the smell was nice for it's own sake, not making me wanting to smoke myself - just like before I'd ever smoked! :D

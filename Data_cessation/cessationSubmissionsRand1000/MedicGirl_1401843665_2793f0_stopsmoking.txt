Need a bit of Moral Support. (Day 4)

Today has been an extremely stressful day...like ready to pull my hair out sort of day. My Vape isn't working correctly; the battery keeps flashing dead even though I've had it on the charger unless I'm trying to use it. The shop where I got it is closed today and I don't have the $150 for one of the newer models they have at the only other shop near me.

There's a little bodega right on the corner, not even a block away that has a huge ad for the cigs I used to smoke right in the window.  Right now, my goal is to limp through with the Vape until the morning, but I need all the moral support I can get. One of my roommates is a chain smoker and has gone through almost two packs today. He has no want or desire to quit and while he hasn't directly affected my efforts, I can't get any quitting support from him. My other roommate believes that since he smoked one cigarette fifteen years ago and hasn't smoked since, it's all just a matter of will and doesn't understand how I'm feeling/what I'm going through.

Here's to a shitty Day 4.

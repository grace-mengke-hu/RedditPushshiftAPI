Over a month and going strong!

Hey all, I don't really browse here as often nowadays as I don't really think about smoking and I rarely crave it now after  about a month of quitting.

Cold turkey is the only real way IMO to cut smoking, the 3-ish days of nicotine withdrawal is terrible but it only gets better from there.

And don't vape unless you're vaping with 0 nicotine. Don't mean to sound preachy but seriously I've tried and you need to flush out nic as quickly as you can.

Thank you to your support and this community for being there to just talk with and sympathize with during the first rough week and a half.

I honestly can't believe its been over a month already, here's to keeping it going til the day I die!

As an asthma sufferer, I just unlocked a life achievement.

Asthma sufferers will know what a peak flow is, but to those who don't, it is is a person's maximum speed of expiration, and it's measured with a device called a peak-flow metre. You basically blow into it as fast and as hard as you can. 

For my entire life, my average was 350-400, however never excelled this. Whilst smoking, it dropped to the mid 300s. 

I did my peak-flow this morning after 2 weeks of no smoking and I reached the highest reading I have ever had in my life. **SIX HUNDRED**. 

That, my friends, is a life achievement unlocked. I am now on par with non smokers, how incredible is that?!?! My asthma, which was diagnosed as chronic (at age 2), has almost disappeared!

Keep going with the quitting guys, if this is the benefits happening to an asthmatic, imagine how amazing your lungs will be if you aren't!!

I am on top of the world right now.

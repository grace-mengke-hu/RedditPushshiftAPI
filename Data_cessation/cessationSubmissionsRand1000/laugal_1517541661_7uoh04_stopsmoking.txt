My favorite part about being 6+ months as a nonsmoker...

I have so many other things in life that I now have time to better and work towards. I don't notice cigs anymore, some people are just weird and fiendish and like smelling shitty and blowing smoke. Wait, how did I ever think that made sense? Couple packs a day for 15 years and it only took 4-5 months to really be free? It really gets ridiculously easy. You all have got this!

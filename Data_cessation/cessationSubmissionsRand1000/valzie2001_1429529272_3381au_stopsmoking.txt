Finally slept last night, 5 days today!

So I finally slept last night all night without waking every hour or having mad messed up dreams!! I did buy a vap pen yesterday, one with zero nicotine, and it helped so much when I had those terrible end of day and my will power to keep fighting it off has dropped dramatically!!! This morning I had zero craving for a smoke when I woke, and no reason to take a puff off of the vap pen either!! I don't know the pro's or con's for the vap pens, but I know I needed something to get me past the intense withdrawal symptoms!! This is my personal best for going this long without giving into the cravings!! I would always make an excuse well just one smoke won't hurt, but it ALWAYS DID!!!!! I'm pretty proud to make it 5 days, I know it isn't many but to me it feels like a huge achievement!! :-)

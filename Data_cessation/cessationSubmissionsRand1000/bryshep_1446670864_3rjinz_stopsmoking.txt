The Royals Parade!

I went to the Royals parade yesterday, and drank all over Kansas City. I didn't think of smoking once! It was nice! 4 months ago, I would have had to break away from the crowd to get a cigarette in. Instead, I got to enjoy every moment of the parade with my friends, and I didn't feel guilty standing where there were kids around. To all of you who are just starting, keep going! I still have a day every once in awhile where I think about smoking, but the days when I don't think about it are beginning to outnumber the days when I do.

I am a little over 4 month in now...

It's funny. I still get these old thoughts go through my brain...like a smoker echo. I was sitting here, doing my work...and I thought to myself "*I should go have a cigg real quick while nothing is happening.*" Its been months since I quit, and I still get these urges from time to time. It's really weird. I feel like they are stronger now then they were after only a one month. Anyway, it seems the urges don't go away quickly, and in my case, they seem stronger sometimes. However, I will be ever vigilant, and be *stronger* than the addiction. Stay strong quitters.

125 day check in: A horrible start to a new year.

The last two weeks of my life have been some of the most challenging, horrible, and stress inducing weeks that I have faced in a long time, and at no time did I want to light up.  Just to show that even in the worst of times you do not need a smoke, let me explain what happened.  

Sunday before Christmas I lost power to my house when an ice storm hit.  I spent a lot of money on hotel rooms and food, because my kids are too young to deal with no power and no heat.  My boys spent Christmas in a hotel room, and Christmas dinner of McDonald's because we lost our food.  

Six days later we got our power back on for 2 hours, then we got a power surge in the house when two unrestrained power lines were blow against each other by the wind.  The surge took out many of my appliances, my PC, and oh my furnace...  I ended up having to spend even more money on an electrician to come out and clear the home and restore power, but that was not until day 7.  

The next day my mom called me and complained she was not feeling well, and needed some help.  She had lost power and tried to tough through it but got sick in the process.  She went to the hospital that night, and spent three days battling a nasty flu she is better now but staying at my home so we can monitor her. 

Finally I got a call from my school and they discovered I did not have enough money in my financial aid to cover my final class, so I am scrambling to find the money to take care of it.  

Through all this, not once did I light up, think about lighting up, or desire a cigarette, Lord knows I had good reasons, but they were never good enough to put my life back on that path. 

TLDR: No matter how bad it is, it is never worth picking up smoking again!

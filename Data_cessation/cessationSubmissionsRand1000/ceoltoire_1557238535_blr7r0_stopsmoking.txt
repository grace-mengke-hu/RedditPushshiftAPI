Fractured a rib - any of you experience this before?

Still waiting around in the hospital. Every doctor and nurse I’ve met so far has told me how important it is to not smoke with this injury and to make sure I deep breathe every 2 hours to avoid getting a chest infection because I can’t cough (it’s just excruciating). Anyone experience this before and have any advice?

Anyway, it all seems like weird timing. I just finished reading Allen Carr’s boot camp and I’m ready to take the plunge... this has added some extra motivation to the desire I’ve been building up. 

What’s holding me back is the fear of losing a friend, which I can objectively look at as an illusion... but I’ve made every cigarette my reward for getting through something, especially when I cut down to 4/5 a day over the last year. 

The other thing is the fear of success in the sense that whenever I’m quitting, I feel bombarded by the guilt of smoking for the last 11 years. I feel like I’ve cheated myself out of good quality life and years ahead of me. I’m 25 now and even though I eat well and am really active, I still can’t eat over how stupid I was to start and how ignorant I was to continue for so long. This past year I’ve been on antibiotics 3 times and had a string of infections. I’m sick of feeling weak. Even 3 a day makes me feel shitty now. 

I know I just have to go into it open minded and with a positive attitude. But any other insights/advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for listening.

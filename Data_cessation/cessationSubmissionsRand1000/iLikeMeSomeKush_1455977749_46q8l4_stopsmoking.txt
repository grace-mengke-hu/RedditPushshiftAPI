Question on different method

Okay I read an article somebody linked me about how quoting cold turkey is supposedly the easiest way to quit smoking, but today is my day one and the cravings get kinda overwhelming at times if only for a few minutes. Has anyone had luck with just cutting down a little bit at a time, like from a pack a day to a half pack to a quarter pack ect? What is the difference in success rates? I don't want to use patches or chew gum, I'm not at all interested in those options but it seems to me that cutting back a little at a time would be easier. Any input or experience on that?

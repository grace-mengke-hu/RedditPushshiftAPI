Request for a PDF copy of Allen Carr's book

Hey all, I just wanted to see if someone could send me a copy of Allen Carr's magical stop smoking book. My badge number is a few months inaccurate, as I recently fell into the classic grad school stress relapse. 

I had been smoke free for a little over two years prior to this, thanks mainly to Carr's book. Unfortunately I can't find my PDF copy of it, so I would really appreciate any help you guys and gals could lend me.

Thoughts on dating and smoking...

Another reason I'm proud of quitting smoking: I recently meet this awesome guy online, yesterday we finally traveled and met up to spend the day together. It was awesome and I'm very hopeful of where this will lead. 

Now, while talking about everything under the sun I said aren't you glad I quit smoking because now I smell great? 

He said, we would have never met up if you were still smoking- that's the #1 deal breaker for me. 

It made me stop short and think about all the dating opportunities  I must have missed due to the stink that followed me around everywhere. How the label of being a smoker is enough for someone to miss out on how fun, loyal and affectionate I am. 

And can I really blame them? I stank, my breath reeked, I was constantly out of breathe, not to mention my whole life revolved around when I would have my next smoke and I was slowly poisening myself one smoke at a time. 

So to the single newly ex smokers out there (or those thinking about quitting) - just think about the new chances you have! Your dating world just expanded exponentially. You are off the deal breaker list, and it's a great feeling :-)

My fourth attempt, with a lot of added motivation. 20 days in.

My last full cigarette was December 24th, 2013. Between then and yesterday, I didn't have anything to smoke. Yesterday I had half a Belmont just to see how I'd react, and I was happy to see that I couldn't do it without a coughing fit. So that proved to me that at least my lungs are *soooo* over it. 

I only smoked for around two years; since I started college. It was social at first, maybe two or three a day, then I built up to a pack a day because I had a few hours between classes and wanted to kill the boredom of waiting. So now I know that **boredom is dangerous**.

There were two things that motivated me. Well, one thing. My grandfather, who smoked two packs a day until he was almost 50 (started when he was 12, Italy emirate?) got throat cancer. I've seen what it's like, and I'm terrified to be in that position.

On boxing day, bronchitis appeared, and I spent a week on my ass having a lot of trouble breathing. That week was a good way to not be able to smoke while trying to quit. It was not even an option, so being really sick straggly made it a lot easier.

I'm not totally sure why I'm posting this. I guess this just seems like a good place for it. Today's a bummer day, it's nice to have a place to journal this shit, you know?

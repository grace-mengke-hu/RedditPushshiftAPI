On day 2, thought it would help to talk about it.

I've been a smoker for about 15 years, tried to quit several times. Trying to save to buy a house, and I can't stand spending so much money on it anymore (8.50 a pack in my state). I don't want to wake up with a sore throat anymore, hacking up phlegm for 5 minutes, wondering how much closer I am to a terrible disease. Anyway, just thought it would help to write this out and share. Take care everyone.

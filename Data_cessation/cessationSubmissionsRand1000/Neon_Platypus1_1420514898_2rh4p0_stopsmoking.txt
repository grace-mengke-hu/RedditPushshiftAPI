I don't think I'm ready to quit. Could you guys give me tips?

I've failed to kick the habit multiple times in 2014. Multiple times, lasting anywhere between five hours to 5 weeks. I've seen how much I improved by not smoking, and I know that I felt way better when I wasn't constantly craving. Well, for the New Year I promised myself I'd take this "quitting" more seriously. My flair hasn't been updated, I just smoked from a newly purchased pack because I've been sitting on my couch all day bored as hell and not sure how to replace the time I spend outside. And I know that I don't want to smoke... I just don't think I'm actually prepared to quit. 

What do I mean? Y'know... I don't really know. Maybe it's the addiction telling me I need it, maybe it's because I just actually don't feel the need to quit, even though I know how much better I am without these things. The New Year's resolution didn't work one bit (but whose does, really?) and I need a new game plan. I need advice, and you guys have helped me in the past, but unfortunately I refused to listen. 

Does anyone here have a regiment/plan/guide to quitting? For example: What do you do when you feel the urge to smoke? What do you replace the time with? Advice like that, really.

Sorry for the wall of text, I just need some guidance in this process. Please and thank you.

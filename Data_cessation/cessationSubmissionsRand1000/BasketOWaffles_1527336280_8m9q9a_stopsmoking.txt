Give me advice on how to push through cravings!

Hello everyone! I am a 24 year old, and I've been smoking for just over 6 years. I've quit twice in that time, once for about a year and a half, and once for about a year. But I always gravitate back towards this vile habit. I'm a carpenter by trade, so nearly everyone im in contact with daily smokes at least a pack a day. But I just had "the talk" with my fiancee for the third or fourth time, and I know if I quit and then relapse she is out the door for good. I've tried everything but a RX. In the past I've found the patch helps alot as it's a physical deterant, your not supposed to smoke with a patch on. But every time I quit I always end up smoking again eventually. It makes me feel like I'm a lost cause, that I'm locked into this for the rest of my life, and that I can't get off this stupid ride. Give me words of encouragement and tips, and methods you've used to distance yourself from other smokers. Help change my mind set, and my life! 

Thank you for your time, this subreddit seems awesome. Although I still feel like I'm hopeless, I hope with the awesome support I've seen on this subreddit can help me walk the straight and narrow. My life(literally) and my future wife/kids- everything I've wanted and have been working towards since highschool is on the line.

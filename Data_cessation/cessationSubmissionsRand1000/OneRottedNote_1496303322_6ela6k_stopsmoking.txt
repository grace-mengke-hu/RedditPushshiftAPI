Still going

53 days, no cigarettes, no cravings, no sense of loss about nicotine or anything related to it, no sense of guilt, shame or other negative feelings.

Quit cold turkey

Lots of exercise, good food, water, sunshine, music, reading, spending time with those I enjoy spending time with, planning a new life and enjoying how I think, feel and act.

Yes Allen Carr helped the most....it still requires willpower and conscious decision making

The worst bit was the first 2-4weeks, I beleieve the body was healing....and for me it hurt after 15 years of systematic abuse. Bt it does get better.

It has been the best thing I could of ever done!

Thw Reality we never want to believe in...

I WANT TO QUIT SMOKING BECAUSE I SHOULD NOT HAVE STARTED AT THE FIRST PLACE.

Smoking is neither bad nor good but actually it's dumb to smoke. Our body is a machine which is not meant for this but for bigger and better things. 

Am feeling motivaited today on my own. Have a party tonight and my biggest test to remain smoke free and I know I will remain smoke free.

Wish me luck guys and good luck to all of those trying to quit.

Someone asked me to go outside for a smoke today in a business setting (trade show)...

And since I'm a non-smoker now, I politely declined. And guess what? I didn't miss out on anything. There was no top-secret conversations I missed, or relationship building suffering. He just said good for you, we will catch up later... and then we did.

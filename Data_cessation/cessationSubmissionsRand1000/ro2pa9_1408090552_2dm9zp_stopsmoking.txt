Let's put some more motivation in here. (2 years!!)

Hi. I would like to thank all of you for the support, that has helped me stay strong for 2 years today. One part that was very important for me when stopping smoking was buying stuff with the money saved. And last week I just finished my battlestation that was all paid for by the money saved and I want to show you. What are the things that you bought or are planning to buy with the money saved?

I want this time to count

I lack discipline in a lot of areas in my life. I use smoking as an outlet for anxiety and as an escape from everything. I also believe that it appeals to me because it is a very self-destructive action and I am, if anything, self-destructive. I've quit for about 6 months before and got back into it but now I'm deciding to quit for good. I'm sick of it. I hope this works. It's been a week so far.

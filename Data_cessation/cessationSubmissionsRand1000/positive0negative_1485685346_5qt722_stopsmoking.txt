I chose to fall for it.

I went out and had a few drinks (which I had stopped doing when I stopped smoking for this very reason and more) with all my close friends who smoke, and I totally chose to fall for it when someone offered me a smoke. I smoked four, actually. I feel super frustrated. I had stopped checking this reddit and have been experiencing a higher level of stress, so I see where my habits contributed snd I will be HAPPILY getting back into non-smoking today but jeez louise, it's a huge reminder of my triggers and what can happen.

Thanks for listening!

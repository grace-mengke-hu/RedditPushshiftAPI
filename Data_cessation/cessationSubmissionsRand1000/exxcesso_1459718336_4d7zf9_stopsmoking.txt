Sorry guys...

...I wasn't strong enough. Yesterday was rough at work and at home. So I bummed three cigarettes off of coworkers/neighbors and I gave in. Today I'm in the midst of a 16 hour long shift, I already bummed one off a nice co-worker. 
And to think that I almost made it a week without cigarettes! I'm ashamed and angry at myself and my lack of self control. This is yet another way in which I've lost control of my life. Most days I can fight the chaos, but this weekend has been tough and I have been weak. I won't bore you with my rant. I'll be re-setting my day count after I submit this post.

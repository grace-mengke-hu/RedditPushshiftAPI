Least expected moments to consider relapse...

It's been over 10 months since my last cigarette, and in my mind things have been going better... a better sense of self awareness, worth, and appreciation of life -- as it relates to people around me; a sense of giving others the benefit of doubt;  significantly cut back on alcohol consumption (though that's the next thing I want to work on still); many less unstable moments with my partner on any given night; etc.........

But it takes just one man in his vehicle to yell at me as he drives passed me that I "shouldn't cross on a red light!!!!"; when in fact, it was paved in his lane as he was turning to "yield", and I didn't have a "red light".

It takes just that one encounter to make me insecure yet again, to think of going for a cigarette.

Guess what, nope.  I can't do it.

Because, as many on this subreddit know, it's just not one puff no matter what.

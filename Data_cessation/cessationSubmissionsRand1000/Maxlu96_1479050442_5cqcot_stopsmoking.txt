What did you buy with the money you saved?

Just got over 100 days. I have this system where I spoil myself with the money I saved. I now have 600 Euros to spoil myself but dont know what with. Not a travel guy. Any suggestions? Also, to those struggling quitting - it feels amazing to have 600 Euros I would not have had otherwise.

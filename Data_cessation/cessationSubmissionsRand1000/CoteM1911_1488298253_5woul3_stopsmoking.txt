Holy SH*T, I forgot my patch this morning...

AND IM TOTALLY FINE GUYS............ I woke up at 6 this morning, usually put the patch (step 2) on around 8 it's now 11am, and I'm at work and just realized I forgot it this morning. I only realized it cause I was itching my arm and didn't feel the smooth patch there. Wish I didn't remember, because now I can't stop thinking about it, but still the craving isn't that serious, if there really even is one. I might just be making it up in my head. 

Today was my 16th day of no smoking, and 16th day of being on the patch. I'm not sure if I'm gonna toss the patches just yet. But I do want to see how far I make it without wanting to climb a wall like the exorcist.

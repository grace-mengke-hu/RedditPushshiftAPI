Forgot to post - one month down!!!

I did it!! Thank you guys so much for your support, I feel better and better every day!

Got a 12km fun run on Saturday I'm participating in on Saturday - I did the course last week for a trial in 55 minutes. Could barely run three km when I was a smoker - now I don't even bat an eye at a 15km run. 

Life is beautiful!!

Day 26 starting to feel a whole lot better!

My body is repairing and healing itself which is a great feeling. not long until i get 1 month. I'm still coughing up tar which I'm sure will take a few months until that is over. My sleeping is becoming better, My smell of food and trees is returning. Life is good!

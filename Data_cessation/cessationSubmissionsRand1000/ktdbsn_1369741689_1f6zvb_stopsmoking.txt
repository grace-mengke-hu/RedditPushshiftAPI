At a party, my boyfriend and I were the only non smokers.

I found myself thinking "I wish I still smoked so I could join in" when they all went out to smoke, and then when they decided to just stay in the house, I still thought the same because then I wouldn't mind the smell.

However, I did stay strong, and I am still smoke free (though my lungs don't agree with me, due to all the second hand smoke.)

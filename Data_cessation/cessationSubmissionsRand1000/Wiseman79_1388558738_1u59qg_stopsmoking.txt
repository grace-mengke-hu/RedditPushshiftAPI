My first Major Test of Stress (18 Days of Smoking)

So here it is the major stress which is making me look for a way to calm myself, My boss has had trouble paying me, claiming it was an error with the bank and he will resend it. He is normally on time for the last 2 years, however, I can't get paid today (New Years) but tomorrow is my last hope because I have bills coming out Friday and I will get big charges if I don't pay them.

I told him I need it by tomorrow, I am sure now I have reminded him he can do one of those same day transfers like he has done in the past.

I have no desire to smoke because my E-Cig is just fine.... I just have a day full of tension/anxiety now waiting, hoping it makes it my bank on time :(   Plus one of my fillings dropped out and I have pain in my mouth :(

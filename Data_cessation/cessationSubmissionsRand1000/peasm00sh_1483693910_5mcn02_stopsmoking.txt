Quitting related insomnia?

So I'm coming through day 4 (yay!) and the last three nights I've been suffering from insomnia. I've read that this can happen with nicotine withdrawal and I'm wondering if it is because I've chosen not to use NRTs.

Any tips for dealing with it? I had to take a day off work and started hallucinating at one point which was pretty uncool.

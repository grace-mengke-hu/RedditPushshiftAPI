Still using NRT lozenges

I'm at 5 months smoke free, but I don't want to give up the lozenges yet.  I'm using the 2 mg, not sure how many a day.  A tube if 24 lasts me 2 or 3 days ish.  I don't even think it's the actual nicotine as much as having something to do when I feel stressed or frustrated. 

The guidelines are you should be done with them at 12 weeks.  I'm assuming that they are far less harmful than smoking.  Any thoughts?  I researched online and can't really find much about risks of continued use.

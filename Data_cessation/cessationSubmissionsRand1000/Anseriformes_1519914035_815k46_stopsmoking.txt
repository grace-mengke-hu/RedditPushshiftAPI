Day 5 and 25 less cigarettes smoked! This post is for all you out there who want to take the leap to smoke-free!

I was a "secret smoker" at 3-5/day only at home. Those few cigarettes were *precious* and my reward, especially at the end of the day. If you're reading this and you've yet to quit and are just sticking your toes in the water, this message is for you!

Just like you I started lurking on this sub. I read these posts for about 6 months probably. I enjoyed reading everyone's successes, and their failures really discouraged me. However, the positive outweighed the good, and I would often see those who fell down and got right back up on their quit feet and were lifted up by the community!

**Seeking Medical Assistance**
I selected a family care doctor in my network who specialized in lungs and respiratory illness and made an appointment. He prescribed Wellbutrin instead of Chantix because he said he has more success with Wellbutrin and the side effects aren't as terrible for *most* patients. The plan was to begin Wellbutrin 2 weeks prior to the quit date and continue smoking until that date. At the quit date replace cigarettes with nicotine gum and if necessary, patches. I was very wary of taking the Wellbutrin because I was afraid of side effects. It's been totally fine, no adverse side effects to report.

**Allen Carr and EASYWAY**
Right after I began my course of Wellbutrin I came across many posts about Allen Carr's book. At first I was like, "Not for me. Self help books have never done it for me," and I moved on. I saw it enough times that I decided to check it out. As I was reading it I was getting excited to quit. His method to replace the **fear of quitting** (fear of not enjoying certain occasions or activities w/o cigs, fear of failure, etc.) really resonated. Every time I've used the Willpower Method and felt like I was "giving something up" instead of **choosing to be free of addiction**, I always came back around at some point. I quit 4 days early. I finished the book.

**Managing Withdraw**
Carr insists you do not use nicotine replacements. The Wellbutrin is probably responsible for lessening the severity and intensity of my cravings, and therefor, I don't have any desire to take in any nicotine now that I've quit that will otherwise post-pone my nicotine withdraw phase. It doesn't fit with my cessation plan but, I just can't bring myself to do it, and I don't *feel* the need for it (thanks Wellbutrin!). My cravings are not the intense kind that I used to have when I was denied a cigarette for any given reason...you know the feeling; panic, anxiety, excitement. It's not there..there's a subtle and fleeting thought of it but not intense at all. 

**Self-Encouragement &amp; Planning for Triggers**
Every day I congratulate myself on making this leap. I fantasize about the next camping trip, next night out with friends, the next vacation, where I'm **not smoking**. That said, it will be some time before I do some partying or smoke some weed...alcohol and pot were personally some major triggers for me. That said, my nonsmoker friends do not feel that any of these activities are less enjoyable because they aren't having a cigarette, and **all of my friends were once smokers**. I'm the last domino to fall. 

**Support from Others**
My best friend is the only person besides my husband who is aware of this journey. She used to be a smoker, so she understands my struggle. She was very excited about my quitting and very encouraging. My husband...well, I don't know that I can say he's been a particularly great cheerleader. He was always indifferent to my smoking, and just as indifferent to my quitting smoking. He doesn't smoke, and he refuses to label me as a nonsmoker. He calls me a Recovering Smoker and says I will never be a nonsmoker and always a Recovering Smoker. It's hurtful. I've told him so. He's not the emotional type so I wonder if I just have different expectations. I disagree with him. My mother hasn't smoked in 30 years (she's 63) and no one would consider her a Recovering Smoker. When I was getting pumped about quitting I shared with him all the reasons; he replied smugly that he didn't "understand why I didn't just quit before, then..." I'm trying not to let it get me down, nor am I going to read into it too much. **I'm doing this for me**.

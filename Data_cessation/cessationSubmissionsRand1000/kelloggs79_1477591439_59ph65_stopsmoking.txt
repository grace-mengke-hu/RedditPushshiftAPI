So, I'm currently part way through day 11 of not smoking.

I'm using patches which seem to have worked for me. I was worried the first few days as it just seemed 'too easy'. Don't get me wrong, I have had my fair share of 'I could really use a smoke' moments!! 

I've had a really tough time at work the past week, with today being one of the worst and really stressful..... But, I am pleased to say, I have NOT given in and reached for the smokes ☺️. Feeling kinda proud of myself just now.

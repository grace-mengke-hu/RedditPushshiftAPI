Didn't smoke for all of 2017 \o/

Just realized I managed to not touch a single cigarette during all of 2017. Also apparently I'm almost 400 days without touching a stinky death stick.

Believe me, mates. It literally hurts in the beginning... but then it gets easier. So much easier. You can all do it!

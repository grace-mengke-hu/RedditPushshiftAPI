I need words of wisdom and a voice of reason.

I quit smoking on April 17th of last year.  I was pregnant so I didn't allow myself to have much choice.  I just did it.  After 20+ years of smoking and multiple quit attempts (and successes and failures) I was sure this was it.  I was finally done.  My husband quit in January of 2013 so it seemed only right that I should keep up my quit after baby was born. 

She was born December 10th.  At first things were going good.  Then, two weeks ago I went to the bar for a drink with friends and I smoked 4 cigarettes while I was out.  I went the whole next week without smoking.  No biggie.  Right?  Last weekend I went out again and smoked, again.  I told my brother in law I wasn't going to buy a pack.  That was my defense against starting again.  Last night I went to my mom's and I smoked again.  Today?  I bought a fucking pack.  I bought a stupid fucking pack.  I don't even like it.  They taste like shit.  They make me feel like shit. They make me smell terrible.  I'm like the mom in This is 40, outside with my robe and my hat and my gloves on.  Hitting the mints and the smell good spray when I come back in.  

This is dumb.  Why am I doing this?  Why don't I just stop?  My life was fine without cigarettes, great even!  Everyone I know who smokes wants to quit.  I was quit.  This is stupid.  Still, I can't bring myself to throw this pack away.  I'm doing the whole, well, I just won't buy another one after this.  When, what I really need to do is stop this before it becomes a problem again.  Because if I smoke this whole pack, I will buy another one.  Tell me how stupid I'm being right now.  Lay it on me.  Lay it on me good.

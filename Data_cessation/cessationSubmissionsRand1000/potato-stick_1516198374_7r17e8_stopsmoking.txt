Day 6- Mind Games

My gums are bleeding like a mad man- a side effect of quitting smoking which indicates that the insides of your mouth were sucked dry and are now getting back to normal. It’s scary to experience nonetheless.

This literally made my messed up brain try to convince me to google if quitting has more painful side effects, in order for me to feel that if going cold turkey is more harmful than helpful, then I should smoke at least one cigarette a day to ensure the process is smooth. Lol. I told my feeble old mind to shut the f up. Not going to give in this time. It’s time to give my body a chance at life it deserves.

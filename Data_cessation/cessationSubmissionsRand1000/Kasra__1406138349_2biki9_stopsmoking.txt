Day 3

Woke up feeling pretty good this morning. I've dealt with depression since I was a teen and I'm beginning to think smoking might have had something to do with that because I don't feel quite so down...for now.


I am having a hard time dealing with a coworker who talks way too fucking much. I mean come on, I don't give a shit about your life right now SHUT UP.
Sigh. I don't know how to actively tell this person to give me some peace so I've just been listening to music, hoping the ear buds are a good indication I don't want to "talk" (more like sit there and nod and smile ffs).

Also, my throat hurts.

But I got this. :) the cravings are less intense today and I am feeling quite proud of myself. I hope everyone has a wonderful day!!!

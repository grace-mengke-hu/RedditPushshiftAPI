One Week Down: What were/will be your ex-smoking milestones.

Last time my quitting anniversary was more important than my wedding anniversary to me. Probably hints at why I'm now divorced. This time I'm quitting for my new family (including me since I want to be part of it for as long as possible) and will consider their birthdays to be the milestones by which I celebrate my control over my addiction.

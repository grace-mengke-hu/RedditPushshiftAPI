It's weird.

I've "quit" smoking several times this year, and then jumped back on it. I think the longest I've made it is 5 days. I've decided to give it a bit of a different approach this time around.

I listened to Carr's stop smoking audiobook last time I stopped and it really helped. Going to re-listen again to aid me and not drink.

What is weird to me is how productive I became when I ran out of cigarettes. I could have no money at all for days while smoking and be uncomfortable with it, but when I ran out of cigs then I'd become manic. Suddenly I could scrounge up fifteen dollars in change hidden in old bags and clothes and drawers. I'd wake up early, energized. I'd have tons of ideas of things to do, and couldn't stop cleaning. I'd get my pack with my newfound change, smoke one, and sit there thinking "I don't really want this". Then suddenly I'm tired enough to go take a nap. Ideas go away. And then I'm anxious. I used to think cigarettes took away anxiety but Mr. Carr is right when he said it makes it worse. 

I think about how my lungs must look. When I'm off of cigarettes I finally feel the damage to my lungs, and when I'd smoke it'd go away. 

The dumbest thing to me though...
I am very cold by nature. In fact, my skin will retain it long after I return into a warm environment. I am not anemic, and sometimes I have to shower to get warm again. This in mind, I'm perfectly warm in my house. It's 30 degrees outside. I put on 3 pairs of pants, a shirt, a hoodie, a jacket, a carhart coat, long socks, shoes, 2 hats, and put the hoods up on this coat at 10pm. For what purpose? To smoke. To stand outside for 15 minutes, get cold, smell gross, not be happy with smoking, and drink a bottle or 2 of water. I have to wash my hands and face afterward because I hate the lingering odor. I go shower, I dry off and feel comfortable, then my brain says "Ay! Let's go have a cigarette!". It's madness. I'm ready to end the cycle.

Who else feels fucking awesome about being a non-smoker?

I just feel really great today!!!  I am proud of me, my friends and family are proud of me, hell... I am even getting props from my boss!
To all those out there struggling, you are strong enough to be free and love the life you are in.  Keep it up you glorious bastards. :)

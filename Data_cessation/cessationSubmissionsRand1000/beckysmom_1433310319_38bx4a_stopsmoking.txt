A welcome 'first'

Today marked the first time that I hopped in the car after a long, busy day at work & didn't crave a cigarette!

I typically smoked to "de-stress" after work. (De-stress, meaning my nicotine addicted brain needed a fix!)  The habit of lighting up in the car after work was so ingrained that it triggered a craving every single day. 

The realization that I didn't have this particularly annoying craving made me so happy that I just wanted to share & celebrate this small victory. Yay! Go me!  :-)

 Hang in there, fellow nonsmokers.  It does get better.  One day at a time.

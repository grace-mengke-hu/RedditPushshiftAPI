Gonna quit. Would like to share.

Hey guys.

So after 10 years of smoking from age 18 to 28, I want to quit,  starting today. I've tried stopping a few times, but never gave a serious effort. I feel that I just have to stop though. The thing is, I feel like shit because of this addiction. The reason why? My wife doesn't know I still smoke.

Yes, I know. I'm a complete ass hat for hiding it. I have no one to blame but myself for this bad decision and I'm not going to make excuses for it, not anymore. So I'm going to stop, today. I'll be going cold turkey, facing the urges and cravings that I rightfully deserve.

2 years ago, I was diagnosed with advanced periodontitis, caused from smoking and poor oral hygiene. I did stop for a while, but secretly gave in to the cravings shortly after. I've lost 20% of the bone mass below my gum line so far. I have improved my oral health and stopped the progression, but I'll never really be healthy until I quit. 

So if you guys don't mind, I'll be using this page as a bit of a support network. I'll try to post every so often as an update and hope to encourage others here.

Again, hey guys, I'm Aphobica, and this is day one.

Am i in the clear yet?

I can feel the addiction dying, it has been slowly going away for the past 2 weeks. But it's not gone completely yet, and that worries me. I know that smoking will only make life worse, and i don't want to smoke, but it still crosses my mind.

When was your transition from "quitter" to "non smoker"?

10 days down and...

... I feel great. This quit has gone much better than ever before, and I don't see myself going back. In addition to quitting the smokes, I also started running, something I've been wanting to do got a long time. Now I'm doing it! 

I'm all over the physical withdrawal, and I realise that the rest is just mental. This does cause some problems for me, because in the past I used the physical feeling and the dizziness as an anchor for doing good and being om the right track. Now I feel fine - could say, I feel like I've just had a smoke, without the coughing, wheezing and smelling like.. Well, smoke. But my hands and my mouth can't quite comprehend that I feel this way WITHOUT smoking, so they feel a bit restless. But I can get over that. 

10 days, wohoo!

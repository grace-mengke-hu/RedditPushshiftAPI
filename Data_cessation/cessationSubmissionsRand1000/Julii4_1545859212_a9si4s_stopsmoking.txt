Dumb

Oh why, oh why have I persisted? I remember my first stupid cigarette, I nearly puked my organs out. Yet I kept smoking and now that I'm finally addicted, I've had enough of it. The bittersweet irony... I really want to quit. I had 7 serious attempts so far. I'm preparing myself and want to quit in 4 days. I really hope this attempt will work out. It's disgusting and since I have an obsessive personality all my mental energy goed towards it. Pfff

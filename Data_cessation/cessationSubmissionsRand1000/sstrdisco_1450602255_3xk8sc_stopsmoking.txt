Today's been a hard day of cravings

It's been a few months since I've had one this intense and it's bad. I've done lots of deep breathing today and have been focusing on staying calm - I've had a touch of anxiety today. On the plus side, I know this won't last and in comparison to where I've been, this could be worse. In the meantime, I feel sort of like shit. Meh.

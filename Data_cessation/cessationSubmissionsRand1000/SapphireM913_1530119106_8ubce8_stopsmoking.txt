How do you know when you're "ready"?

I've tried and failed so many times I lost count. I've justified it over and over, I've lied, I've snuck around, I tell myself I want to stop, I need to stop, but... I haven't. People say "you have to want to for you" and "you have to be ready to let it go". 

What was that moment like for all y'all? Was it a subtle, internal thing, was it a ton of bricks falling on you?

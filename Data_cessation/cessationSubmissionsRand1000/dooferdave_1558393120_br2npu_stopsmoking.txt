Just passed 5 years. After 28 years smoking I can say that I am now a non-smoker.

I ride 6k/yr (150+ miles a week) on my bike. I ran a 5k last week. I just got my numbers. Other than a little high blood pressure (150/79), I had great numbers. No cholesterol issues, glucose is good. HDL at a 70!

Feels good! 

This sub has been a big help. I have been on here since the beginning, reading and getting a lot of motivation and confidence. I really didnt want my badge number to be meaningless. Plus since I quit with a vape, I was very active early on helping those trying to quit with the step-down method of vaping. I dont recommend it to everyone because everyone is different and we all have our motivations, reasons, fears and habits so there is no one-size-fits-all solution. That is just what worked for me.

To be cliche', keep up the fight. It's really about "not smoking today". remember that. one day at a time. To all of you people in the thick of it, congrats on your journey. Take this sub for what it is, a bunch of quitters just like you doing what your doing and going thru what you are going thru. Each in their own way. Stay the course and you will be through it before you know it. Everyone here is super helpful even if you feel you have nothing to offer. its not true. The sub as a whole is what it is about, not you or me per se. My post will fall off the new page and it will become a part of reddit history soon enough. The sub however will live on and be here for you and the quitters after you. I feel good that I add a small part for a short time to what this sub is about.

To those that came before me, thank you. I needed it.

Cheers to /r/stopsmoking for being there for so many when they needed you most.

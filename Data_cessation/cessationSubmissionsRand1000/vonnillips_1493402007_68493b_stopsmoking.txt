Having a hell of a tough one today boys

I woke up this morning with a severe craving that hasn't let up at all. Dunno what might've triggered it, but it's there.

I'm not gonna smoke of course but this is easily the worst cravings I've had since quitting. I was fortunate in that I virtually had 0 physical withdrawal symptoms so the worst of it for me has always been mental.

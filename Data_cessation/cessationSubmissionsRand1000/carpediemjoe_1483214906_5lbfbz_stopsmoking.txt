Hypnosis for Post-Quit Depression

Hey guys,

I've posted on here before the hypnosis YouTube video I used to quit smoking (https://youtu.be/Iy6A1IOkIsM). I'm 62 days into my quit and still smoke free.

I've been struggling with depression quite a bit since I quit so I found this hypnosis YouTube video by the same guy but this one is for depression. It made all my anger and sadness go away. If you are looking for something to try give it a shot. Only takes 15 minutes. Here is the link: https://youtu.be/c2s2bVWWu7A

Happy New Yea!

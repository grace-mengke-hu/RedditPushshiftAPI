2months tad√°

Well i dont even know what to say, its gone really fast and im looking forward to be still a non smoker. I would like to elaborate more, but i just dont really care about smoking. Its past and it will stay that way. Good luck guys, stay strong, ty for all the help on my first month and happy non smoking Valentine <3

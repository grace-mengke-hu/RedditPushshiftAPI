This is weird

I expected many different symptoms of withdrawal and being a non-smoker.  But I'm wondering if anyone else has encountered this.

Practically every day, and sometimes several times, I accidentally bite my tongue while eating.  Now this happens to everyone from time to time, but since quitting it has happening all the time.

Anyone else?

Oh, and I still haven't figured out pocket organization.

5 days strong, quitting several bad habits at once.

I'm 5 days smoke free and feel pretty strong. I've not only quit smoking, but also drinking and unhealthy eating (including no meat for the time being) I think because I piled on so many changes in behavior, each craving pulls my attention away from the other and is kind of keeping me on my toes.

Today I focused on eating right, learning new ways to eat tofu. I realized that it's 7PM (I'm in Asia) and I've been so caught up in food, I haven't even thought about smoking. 

I knew that it would be hard to try to modify a bunch of behaviors at once, but I never thought there would be any benefits.

Has anyone battled to quit a bunch of stuff at once? I'm usually pretty good at week one, the raw craving week, and awful at week two, the "fuck it" week, like I've already proved it. Let's hang in there friends, and kick the Nico-monster's ass.

EDIT: spelling

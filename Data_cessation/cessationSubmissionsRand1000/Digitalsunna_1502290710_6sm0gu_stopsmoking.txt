My mind is trying to trick me

16 days smoke free but still using nicotine, patch and mouth spray and in my mind there is like this low level chatter of "smoking is gooooood" and it's driving me nuts. I'm constantly battling my own sneaky thoughts and I feel exhausted. Couldn't make it in to work today, too tired and feeling too depressed. All I want to do is just sleep, and then sleep some more. I can deal with the tiredness but I'm just so scared that I will believe the chatter and smoke again, I don't want that, but at the same time I do. Arrrghh.

Update: Got rid of the patch and spray yesterday and am nicotine free now. Thanks for the advice.

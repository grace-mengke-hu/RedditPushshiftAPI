My smoking dreams are getting wierder

What's weird is that I just was telling my wife that I haven't had a smoking dream in a while then last night I dreamt that some guy was smoking and I grabbed his pack and just simply smelled one of the cigarettes out of the pack(unlit) and handed it back. 

I remember how it smelled and I am not sure if it was the real smell or not but it smelled funny. Anyway, he said "you can have one" and I just said "nope, I don't smoke anymore". I had a slight craving right then and there but it went away.

ciao~  we got this.

Let's talk about dreams

I had a dream last night that someone gave me a cig to hold and I took a drag out of habit. Cue immediate panic and a dream debate on whether or not I should just finish the whole thing. The funniest part was that I was so disappointed with myself because I knew I would need to reset my counter back to zero! 

How amusing that this little ticker is something that subconsciously gives me a great sense of pride, so much that I was panicked to have to start over again!

Now on a related note- how have everyone's dreams been? I have had some pretty intense dreams as of late- wake up heart pounding sorta stuff. It's like the emotions I feel in dreams are amplified x 10. It's been over a month and I'm still having them occasionally. Anyone else?

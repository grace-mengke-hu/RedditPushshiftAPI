70 days and I have been sick the whole time...not sure if it's quitting or just getting sick

Yes, yes, I have been to the doctors. about four times over the last two months.  I've gone from having a cold to an ear infection and back to a cold.  I've had antibiotics and flonase prescribed.  Still congested.  Nothing so bad that i can't go to work, but super annoying. 

It probably isn't all from quitting smoking since nearly everyone I know is also congested, had the flu, some have had pneumonia, and others have had ear aches too.  I think it's just a bad cold/flu season.  

But the point is that I have yet to really breathe like the non-smoker I am!  I am so frustrated!  Obviously, I'm not going to smoke, but arrrggg!

No idea where else to put this.

It's been something like 45 days since I had my last cigarette. I'm doing good. I've managed to not smoke while dealing with stress at work. I've managed to not smoke after fights with the wife or kids. I've been pretty proud.

But, I just found out my buddies three year old son has an inoperable brain tumor and has been given three months to live.just doesn't seem fair.

I'm sitting in my car in front of a corner store. I just had to get out of the house. Right now, I'm having a hard time seeing the point in not smoking.

I'm not gonna smoke. and I'm not looking for comments to help me feel better. It's just like I said, I really have no where else to put

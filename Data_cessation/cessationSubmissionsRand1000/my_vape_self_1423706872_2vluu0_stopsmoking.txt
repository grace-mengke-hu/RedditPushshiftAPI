Just had my Cake Day

The other day, when New England weather and business travel collided, I had my cake day.  

In case you don't know, Cake day is the 'birthday' of your reddit account and you get a little wedge of cake by all your posts during that day.

So one year and two days ago, I made a promise to myself.  I was going to find my way out of the maze.  I was going to leave behind the tag of smoker. 

I created a new account for my quitting self.  As I happened to be using an e-cig with nicotine, I chose the name my_vape_self.  

I would say that things are going well.  I have more milestones coming.  One year without a cigarette and then one year without nicotine (that is the flair).  I do not count the days.  But I do love a good Birthday.

Cheers my friends.   ***Let's do this.***

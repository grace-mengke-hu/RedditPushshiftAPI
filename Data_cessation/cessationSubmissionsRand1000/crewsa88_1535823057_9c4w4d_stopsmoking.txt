Last resort PATCH and ECIG

I have been trying to quit smoking for three years now. I’ve gone cold turkey in the past and never make it over two weeks. My boyfriend keeps threatening to leave me. The pressure to quit is overwhelming. The stress he generates triggers desire to smoke. The constant sniff inspections to my hair is humiliating.  It’s a no win situation for me.

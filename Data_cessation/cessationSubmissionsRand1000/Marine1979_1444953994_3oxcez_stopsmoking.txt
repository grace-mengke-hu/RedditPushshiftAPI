Hooooraaa Two Weeks

Watch what you pray for cause you just might get it! I am still so new at this freedom from bondage of the nicotine. Now I feel some anxiety along being elated at the same time. Now I don't have to try and hide the stench from smoke around my family friends and co workers that took so much energy from my life. My breathing has improved and my skin color has changed and toothpaste taste different. 

I really need to take this 
One day at a time

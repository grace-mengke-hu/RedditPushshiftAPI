50 days. I'm more proud than I thought I would be.

I decided to do something crazy this time around. I told *everyone* about it. Fucking everyone. Even random fucking people I bumped into at sports, strangers on the street, girls I was dating, my parents, my brother, every friend in the world.

I was terrified to do that because how fucking stupid would I look if I go back?

Well, that's still true. I would look stupid if I go back. But I know the truth: I wouldn't judge someone who went back to smoking. I know how hard it is. I'd just think, oh well, there goes another one. 

But what keeps happening is this: people keep bringing it up. "How are you doing with quitting?" "Still quit?" "Doing good on the cigarettes?" 

Now every fucking day, I get to tell someone that I'm doing OK. People really fucking care. Even people that are struggling to quit are telling me they are proud of me. Now, I know this sort of cheap ego-boosting is probably not good in the long run, but for the first few weeks, it's been really amazing to see that I really am not alone in this. People around me care about whether I smoke or not, because they care about my well being. They care about the effort I put in to keep myself healthy. 

I'd put that message out to anyone willing to hear it.

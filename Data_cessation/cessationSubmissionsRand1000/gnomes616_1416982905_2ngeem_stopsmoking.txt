124 days, checking in

Hey r/stopsmoking, I hadn't checked to see how long it's been since I quit so I figured I'd say hi! I stopped keeping track last month, today was actually 4 months since I quit (July 25th) and I barely even noticed! I walked past someone smoking what smelled like American Spirits and it was awful D:

Things have been stressful, and there's been a lot of tears and frustration at work and at home (what with the husband quitting, too), but I feel lucky to have not had it as bad as some. We've been able to stress each other out and come back down, and my coworkers have all been fabulously supportive. I had a bit of a blow up with a heavily pregnant coworker, and when we had a hash-out with everyone, another coworker said "Jesus, we've got pregnant-and-swollen-ankles and quitting-smoking over here, no wonder it's an emotional wreck!" It was a good time!

Hang in there, everyone, the only way to go from the bottom is up!

Drinking alcohol in the early days

Wow! I knew it would be a tricky milestone but was not ready for that! A couple of drinks and it was all I could think about for over an hour, the strongest craving yet. Had to leave the pub in the end. How soon before it's safe to go back out again?! Going out for a meal tonight which I am now slightly concerned about! Any tips on how to cope in those situations?

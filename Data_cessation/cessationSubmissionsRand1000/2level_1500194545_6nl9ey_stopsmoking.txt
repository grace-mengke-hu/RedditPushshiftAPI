Missed the 2 years mark

Yesterday somebody was smoking near my table and I realised that I quit 2 years and two weeks ago. 
It is a relief,  no more being miserable while waiting the next cig,  no health concerns, more energy, one thing less to care about.
This forum helped me a lot,  best wishes to all of you

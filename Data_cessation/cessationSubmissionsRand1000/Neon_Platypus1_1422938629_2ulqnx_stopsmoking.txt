I'm finally finished!

I just finished Allen Carr's book. I just extinguished my final cigarette. I have never inhaled that deeply, that strongly, and regretted every breath. My lungs felt like they were being charred, I pretty much suffered through the last puffs. I brought three cigarettes outside with me, as a last hurrah, but broke the other two in half before even finishing the first one. I extinguished that little bastard with a smile, and now I'm giddy as a school girl typing this out. 

I've "quit" in the past using the Willpower Method ("cold turkey") but it never worked. I always succumbed to that little bastard. But now I'm fucking confident as hell and I don't care who knows. I'm ready for the withdrawal, I'm finally free of those things. 

Fuck yes. Guys who haven't quit yet, I sincerely suggest that you read Allen Carr's book. There are free PDFs online if you don't want to spend the measly $12. It's so simple, it's so worth it. And the entire time, you wonder why you even started in the first place. 

Wish me luck, guys. I'm sure I don't need it, but it still helps knowing I got this sub behind me.

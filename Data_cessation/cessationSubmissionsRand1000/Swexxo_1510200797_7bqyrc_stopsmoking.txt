16, smoker. I want my sanity back.

I'm 16, and I'm aware I should stop while I can. After many failed attempts, after many packs flushed down the toilet.. after many cigarettes inhaled-I wish to stop. 
Do you have any advice? Any literature I should read? 
Smoking has yet again snuck back into my life, with only myself to blame. 

Please help me.

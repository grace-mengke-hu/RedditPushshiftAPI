The hospital scared the smokes out of me

Since I started smoking only a year ago, I was still in the social smoker/I smoke for pleasure phase. I had my first taste of the power of the addiction in March, when a weeklong vacation resulted in me smoking upwards of 30 cigarettes a day. To put this in context, I usually smoke 2-3 a day, and never wanted to smoke any more. After the vacation, I toughed out the withdrawal, but went back to 2-3 a day soon enough. I always thought it was fine this way, after all, 2 a day won't kill you, right? 

In the last week of July, I was hospitalised for dengue. I was receiving 8-10L of IV fluids a day, and my blood was taken every 4 hours. This meant tubes everywhere and constant needles. Since I had so much liquid being pumped into me, I had to pee 10 times a day, and since I wasn't allowed to get up and go to the bathroom, had to do it in a bottle. Just the humiliation of having to wear a slutty hospital robe with my ass hanging out, while peeing into a bottle and handing it over to a disgusted nurse, all the while with a terrible fever and headaches made me realise I never, ever want to be hospitalised again. If it was so bad for something like dengue, what will it be like for lung cancer? For COPD, emphysema? For a stroke? When I will have to crap in a bedpan? When I will suffer in a blinding white room, surrounded by death and unable to talk? The horror! 

Even if 2 cigarettes a day are not going to kill me, there is no way in hell I will take that risk. No chance. Being sick is one thing, but losing all control is another. And every time you smoke, the nicotine takes over the reins of your body. Quit now. If you are not able to, go to a hospital ICU/ward and stay there for a couple of hours. The suffering is terrifying.

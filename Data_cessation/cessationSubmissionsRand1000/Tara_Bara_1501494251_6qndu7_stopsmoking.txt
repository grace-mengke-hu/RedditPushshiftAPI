My Biggest Trigger

I was looking back on my previous relapses and noticed they all had 1 thing in common...I was doing something celebratory/social just before. Could be anything from going out to eat with coworkers to attending a concert, but at some point during the event, my addict will start talking to me. I'll find myself not being able to wait to get out of there so I can go to the gas station, which I promptly do!

I don't want to turn into a hermit, but I'm only on Day 5 (ignore the badge), and I think learning this about myself is huge. Would it be terribly wrong to isolate myself for a few weeks (to the extent I'm able; I still have to work)? I know they say to not change routine after you quit, but I'm still getting my sea legs here and want to protect this quit at all costs.

Any advice would be appreciated, thanks!

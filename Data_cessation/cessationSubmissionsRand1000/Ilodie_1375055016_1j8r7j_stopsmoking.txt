Friends are not being supportive.

A lot of my friends are smokers, and while my best friend has been making a point of a) not smoking around me and b)congratulating me every day for not smoking, my other friends have been less than supportive.

Examples:

"Well just get a drink in you, then you'll start again"

"You'll cave. It's ok if you do! You just always cave"

"I wouldn't talk about how you're not smoking so much. When you cave it'll be really embarrassing"

While I have noticed that I've been maybe a bit... ebullient about not being a smoker anymore, I haven't been incessantly talking about it. Nor have I been pushing it on my friends who aren't interested in quitting.

Anyway, thanks for being supportive, /r/stopsmoking!

So here I am!

Posted yesterday as I've been reading Allen Carr's EasyWay over the last 3 days. Previous quit attempts have failed, but I have always felt like I was giving something up. I would go to bed feeling sure I'd smoked my last but by the morning that excitement and resolve had been replaced with a depressed feeling of loss, followed by panic. 

This time I allowed myself a couple this morning and then had my last whilst reading "The Final Cigarette" chapter. Every time I have a craving I tell myself "I'm free! I don't have to do that to myself any more!" And it already feels like a more positive experience. Ok, it's only been 3 hours but even when I was smoking whenever I wanted, I would have been champing at the bit to get outside and smoke by now. So far so good! I do not want to smoke. I am now a non-smoker. Long may it continue :)

Best of luck to everyone else quitting the poison, and here's to a better quality of life for all of us!

EDIT: why are people down voting this post?!?! What the hell is wrong with it/me? That's really sad!

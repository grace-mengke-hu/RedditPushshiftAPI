"Just one" is how we all got here in the first place

It's day 22, cold turkey. The honeymoon of this being my "best quit yet" is over. On the morning of day 15 my entire mood changed and I spent the entire work week miserable. But last weekend, I went out Friday and Saturday, drank, and did not smoke a single ciggy.

Today Im getting symptoms of the quitters flu, and I know a cigarette would make it 1000x worse. I cant breathe and Im constantly sweaty and my nose is clogged and my head hurts and...

Ive been preparing myself for the future cravings pretty well. The first and second weekend I made plans with exclusively non-smoking friends. This past weekend I everyone "Im coming to the bar, but dont let me smoke."

I didnt even ask for one, I just chewed my gum instead. I was pretty proud of myself for training myself to do that.

Now Im going over in my head the counter thoughts to "Well one wont hurt you."

We all forget that just one is exactly how this mess started. It was just one, after school, that a friend who has long since quit gave up. We didn't even like it, but the next day we had another. It became a terrible habit and we got used to regulating our emotions with nicotine.

I want a cigarette, but What I REALLY want is the release of all my emotional tensions. So Ill just have to find that elsewhere. (I could use some advice on this.)

TLDR "Just one" is how we got here in the first place and just one will be how we return here with our tails between our legs.

Just one is too many.

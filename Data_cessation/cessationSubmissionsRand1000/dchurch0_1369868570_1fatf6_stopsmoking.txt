I suck at this

I said I was going to quit about a week ago, and only lasted one day. Pay no attention to my badge, as it is a lie. I will update it again once I finally forge ahead with quitting.

I've been lurking on the subreddit since then trying to gain motivation. I think my mind is finally set to make this happen.

The key is that I can't try to quit. I just have to quit. Plain and simple. Not one puff ever from now on. I know I can do this, I just have to make sure I stick to it and don't give in to my mind's stupid rationalizations. 

Honestly, I've been scared to quit smoking (and drinking) because my life is pretty boring in the evenings and on weekend. I don't have any kids or responsibilities once I get home from work, so I drink and smoke to pass the time. Couple that with the fact that boredom drives me INSANE, and you can see where I'm at. I've come to realize, though, that there are hundreds of things I can do to pass the time, and I hope to explore those options in the future.

I found an awesome quote on another self-help subreddit (/r/stopdrinking) that really got my mind spinning in the right direction. I've since posted it in a couple of threads here in stopsmoking. 

I have it saved as a PNG file which is now the background image on my computer, so I can always be reminded of these wise words.

Here it is:

Don't think about not smoking for a year, or a month, or a week. Don't give yourself an ultimatum.

Just think about not smoking today, or not smoking this hour, or not smoking right now.

Look at your hands. Are you holding a smoke right now? No? Great job! You're doing it!

See, that wasn't so hard after all.

There's nothing to be scared of. You've already proven that you're capable of not smoking right now.

Now do that again.

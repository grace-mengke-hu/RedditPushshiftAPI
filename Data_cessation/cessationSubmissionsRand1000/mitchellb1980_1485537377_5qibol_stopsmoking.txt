Small changes matter...

So I've quit however many days ago now, my Dad has taken notice, he and Mom both still smoke a pack a day.
Prior to my quit, they both smoke like chimneys in their vehicles.

noticed something while out with dinner last night, a small thing to some, but on other level's very huge to me.

Sister's birthday, they drove from their house to the restaurant, maybe a five minute drive away. Neither of them smoked there, no big deal, knew Mom had one before we left. Dad lit one up after we got out of the truck, which I instantly noticed and was impressed by, that's his subconscious way of approving of my quit.

After dinner, they both lit up outside, I get in the truck, dad put his smoke out early, mom get's in the truck and opens the window all the way. Dad's effort definitely wins there, Mom is so far gone that she thinks an open window makes a huge difference. Honestly at this point I can handle being around the smoke, could not care too much if they smoke in the vehicle with me or not kind of thing, But appreciated that dad went out of his way not to force me to smell it kind of thing :-)

Thought I would share that, with hope that one day, this all sinks in to him and he finally gives it up as well... Baby steps

Quit smoking 24 hours ago, and am now struck with a wave of sadness

If "wave of sadness" doesn't make sense to you then I'm sorry because I've no idea how else to explain it. Anyway a few days ago I finished my "last" pack and decided to quit. 48 hours later I found myself buying not a single pack but *an entire carton*. Why? I'm really not sure. I guess I simply couldn't imaging my life without smoking. Upon fishing the first pack from the carton, however, I felt really foolish and like I wasn't in control so I sold the remaining 9 packs at a loss and actually felt good about that. That feeling ended 12 hours ago was replaced by a crushing sense of sadness and depression. When will this go away? because with cravings I can deal with, but this agony is unlike anything I've ever felt (and I was diagnosed with schizoid personality disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder and major depressive disorder 10 years ago). Oh, I'm 28 and I've been smoking for 10 years. (And no, smoking didn't cause all my life's misfortunes... though it may have been a trigger.)

Dreams about cigarettes

As the title implies, I've been dreaming about the things. I quit a little over 2 weeks ago and my past 3 or so dreams was me smoking a cigarette. Not sure what it all means but I don't want a smoke when I wake up anymore. Maybe my self consciousness only thinks it's getting nicotine.

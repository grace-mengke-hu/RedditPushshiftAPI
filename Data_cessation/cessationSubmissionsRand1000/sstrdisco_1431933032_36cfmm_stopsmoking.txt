I did not smoke.

Tonight was my first night out in a party type setting. A girlfriend of mine had her birthday party tonight. The group she invited largely consists of smokers and people I've always smoked with. We went bowling and after we all stepped outside and everyone lit up, I stepped a bit to the side. No one asked me if I wanted a smoke; I did not ask for a smoke; I romanticized wanting a smoke, but recognized that and changed my train of thought. It wasn't my favorite experience, to be around that many smokers, but I got through it. I'm proud of myself. That could have been a moment of weakness for me, but I chose to keep my shit together.

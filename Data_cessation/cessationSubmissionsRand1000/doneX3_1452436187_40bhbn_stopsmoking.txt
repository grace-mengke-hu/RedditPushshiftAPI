Ghost of Emphyseme Future. Yikes.

I've quit for 49 days and feeling very good about it. Mostly forgot about smoking. I noticed for awhile I kept coughing up junk, and thought, ew, good thing I quit now before things got worse. Then last week I had a nasty flu with heavy congestion. Still hacking it out. I imagine that this is what emphysema must be like. Hard to breath. Coughing out junk all the time. Ghost of Emphysema Future. Yikes. Not going back to that shit, no way. 

Have a great day. 

Edit. Corrected spelling of emphysema. Can't fix title.

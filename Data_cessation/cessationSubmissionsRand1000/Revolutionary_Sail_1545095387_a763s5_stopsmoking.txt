90 days completed, but smoked 1 cigarette today.

I had a bad day, fight in the office, there no fuck attitude towards the employees relapsed me and i went and smoked one thinking that would help but that doesn't make any difference but now i am regretting it and worried that 
WILL I BE GOING AGAIN AND SMOKING?
Please suggest somethings to stay motivated and deal with such situations.

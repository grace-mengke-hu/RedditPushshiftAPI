Failure. Resetting to make it right.

Right now I'm waiting for the bot to change my quit date to today. My badge used to read 224. A magic number. My failure was not today, it has been a while.

I have to make it right now. Back when I didn't smoke, I told everyone that it isn't so hard. Resist for a few minutes and I was okay.

I'm counting on myself. I will make it right this time.

Just had my second vacation as a nonsmoker.

And while it wasn't as hard as the first, it was different. More...of a romanticizing nature? I would see someplace where I had previously enjoyed a cigarette and I would...I felt like I missed it. So that was a new situation for me; it wasn't a craving, it wasn't a trigger, it was a...I'm not sure how else to describe it. Overall, it felt both comforting and uncomfortable at the same time. I even thought how easy it would be to buy a pack of cigs. At any rate, I stuck to my guns and did not smoke. I treated these thoughts as triggers/cravings and I did as I normally would, I just went on about my business.

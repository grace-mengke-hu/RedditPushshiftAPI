18 days now. thank you subreddit

Hi,

i dont smoke anymore and i dont even have any desire to do so.

one thing scares me: it was really easy, once i spend one week not smoking. why didnt i stop two years ago?

if you read this and you are still smoking. just stop, it is not as hard as you think. you just have to not light a cig for a week, afterwards you will not want to do so anymore.

btw: you will feel better for many reasons: you dont harm your health anymore, u smell better, ur breath is better, u feel like you won, you can do sports... etc.

to sum up: it really is worth it and it is not as hard as everyone thinks. good luck with becoming a non smoker

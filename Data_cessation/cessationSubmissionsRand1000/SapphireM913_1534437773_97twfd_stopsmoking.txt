2 weeks, cravings are kicking my ass today

Yesterday was 2 weeks. 14 whole days. Longest I've gone since getting divorced, when I started.

My 2 week reward was ordering a new pair of custom Converse. You can actually design everything, side colors, inside fabric, laces, eyelets, stripe, rubber color... Everything. I love doing this, because when I wear Converse, I feel most like ME, and these are designed by me, so yep, they are perfect. They're a treat though, so making it to 2 weeks was an awesome reward.

Today? Cravings are literally hitting me in waves every hour. They haven't been this bad the whole time. I have no focus, I am verging on stabby (I thought I'd exited the "everything sucks and I'm probably going to murder you if you look at me or breathe or think" stage), I don't know what the hell is going on. I got a reward! My brain should want to continue on the rewards path! I have some bitching rewards set up for 1, 2, 3 months. 

STAHP, BRAIN, YOU'RE FINE.

Day 2, and I feel like clawing my eyeballs out

First of all, Merry Christmas y'all (At least it's Christmas here)

I didn't smoke yesterday and didn't buy a pack so I figured I'd try and see how long I can not smoke to gauge how difficult it will be to quit smoking for 2017.

It's only day 2 and I have to say I'm really feeling it. It's hard. The cravings are eating me alive right now, I spent half of my day just antsy and irritable and impatient, feeling like I really need it for myself to feel normal. It's 3:25am where I live and I can't go to sleep because I'm craving so badly. 

I just want to curl up into a ball and pass out or die but I'm just awake and uncomfortable. That's one word that can describe withdrawal for me - uncomfortable. You're not sure exactly what part of your body is bothering you but there is some sort of discomfort permeating through my entire body and my mental state. Sometimes I swear I can smell and taste my cigarettes even when there's no second hand smoke even in the air.

I know I've still got a long way to go, but at least when I look back on this hell I'm going through, it'll stop me from starting smoking again. 

I actually want to claw my god damn eyes out, scream and flail and just chainsmoke an entire pack but I'm gonna resist. Merry Christmas everyone.

Quitting while living with smokers

I've been smoking for 25 years and not only know that I need to quit, but I want to quit. My husband smokes and isn't ready to quit. We also have a roommate who smokes. Any advice on successfully quitting while surrounded by it? My husband is a pushover as well. Anytime I'm struggling (I've tried quitting several times), he willingly gives me a smoke without any resistance at all. I need to get this done for multiple reasons, but always feel like I'm setup for failure. Any advice or tips would be most appreciated.

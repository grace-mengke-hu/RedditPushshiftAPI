I finally want to take quitting seriously!

It has only been about 24 hours for me and I have been trying to quit over the past couple of weeks. I am twenty years old and started smoking around fifteen. Over the past few weeks I have been telling myself I need to quit and have been telling my friends so too. Although I go twenty four hours here and there quitting, I just can not seem to quit for longer than that time. I want today to be the day where I start taking quitting seriously and start looking towards quitting for the long term. I am using a vaporizer and trying to just not pick up a cigarette. This is my first time even quitting and have not made such attempt like this before.

What tips do you have for me to resist the urge of smoking and what pitfalls did you experienced while quitting for the first time? How should I avoid smoking while with my friends?

[90 Days]

With every milestone that I've reached, I kept saying that I never thought I would've gotten here.  I think I'm going to have to stop saying that.  Now I know I'll reach them all in the future.

I just wanted to say thank you to all of you because your stories, helpful words and successes have been a big part of why I made it here today.

I have a big party tonight and lots of people will be smoking.  I'm going to use tonight as more confirmation that I can reach my goal.

I know I have a long way to go to beat this thing (60 years or so), but with /r/stopsmoking on my side I don't see myself not having the strength to succeed.

Thanks and the best of wishes to everyone reading this.

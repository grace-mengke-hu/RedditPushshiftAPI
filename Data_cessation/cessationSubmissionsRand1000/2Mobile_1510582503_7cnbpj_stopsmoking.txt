Is it in my head or is it real: A question for you vapers

I have been a pack a day smoker for almost 30 years and I havn't had a cig since last thursday (solid three, almost 4 days). I have been vaping like a freight train since, so I am not missing any nicotine nor should be withdrawing from it. But today, I am a pissy son of bitch, my body hurts, and I am anxious as hell. Is this just me wanting a cig for the sake of a cig, or am I possibly withdrawing from something else besides nicotine?

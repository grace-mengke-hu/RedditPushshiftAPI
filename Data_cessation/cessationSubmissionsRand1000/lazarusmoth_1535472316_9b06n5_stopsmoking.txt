Day 5. Nicotine monster still kicking weakly.

I still give any craving, even a weak one, a wide berth. There's still that voice that says, "You've proven to be the master, surely you can take one puff and show that you can control it now." 

Very devious. I still need to delay, get a drink of water, and take a few minutes to breathe. It's kinda sad that I prolly wouldn't ever be rid of that nicotine whisper. Just hoping for even one day where I don't think about smoking.

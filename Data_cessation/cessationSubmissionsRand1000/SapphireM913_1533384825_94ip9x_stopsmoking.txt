2 giant hurdles yesterday

So I'm on day 4, this time with patches and lozenges. Two of my biggest hurdles were always sex and drinking. I went to my friend's house last night for our bi- weekly dungeons and dragons, everyone was drunk (not unusual). I wanted to drink so badly, but I also didn't want to jeopardize my quit at all, so I stayed sober. One of the group smokes. I couldn't even smell it on him after he'd come back inside. Afterwards my FWB asked me to come over and I'd been dreading this. Not the sex, but the after, the "I'm SO relaxed, let's just go outside for one". Didn't even think about it, and it turns out it's a million times better to cuddle and fall asleep than to put on clothes to go outside, stand alone on the front step while he's inside, and go back in wanting to cuddle but knowing I now stink.

I still get cravings. I'm still tracking them. But with the patches they're like a 4-5 and last 5 minutes, whereas cold turkey they were an 8-9 and I was white knuckling my life for 15-20 minutes. Concerned for when it comes time to step down, but that's a problem for Future Me.

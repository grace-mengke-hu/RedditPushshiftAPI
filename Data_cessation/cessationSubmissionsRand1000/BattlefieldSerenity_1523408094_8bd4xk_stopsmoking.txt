aaaaaAAAAAHHHHHHG DAY ONE

I APOLOGIZE FOR THE CAPSLOCK BUT I FEEL LIKE I HAVE ALL OF THE ENERGY. ALL OF IT, IN THE WORLD. ALSO IM EXHAUSTED AND GOING TO BED. 

I get normal again, right? Like, I'm not always going to be this crazy, kinda dickish guy I've been today? I'll be a more sane, dickish guy like I used to be in a few days? Or a few weeks?

I'm never going back to nicotine. But if I really gotta work on my personality I wanna start now!!!! If this weird guy who was out today is just because of withdrawal or change in habit, then I don't have to worry.

Ah. Going to sleep. Will respond when I'm back.... IWNSWYT

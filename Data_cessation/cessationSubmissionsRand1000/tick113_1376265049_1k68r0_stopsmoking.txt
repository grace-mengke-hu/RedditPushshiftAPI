11 days and forgetting

The last couple days have been rough, including several close calls.  I realized that much of the nightmare smoking is already fading from memory.  In fact, I was reading John Polito's Free From Nicotine today, and he actually covers this.  It's natural for the brain to "forget" the bad.   He recommends writing down all of the misery to help you remember.  I kind of wish I had done that.  I'm not sure I was prepared to forget how awful it all was so fast.

So to those just starting, walk through your day and write down how the addiction drives every decision, how awful it feels, and how much worry it causes.

On a related note, I like Polito's book so far.  I've read EasyWay at least a hundred times.  I get it, but I don't.

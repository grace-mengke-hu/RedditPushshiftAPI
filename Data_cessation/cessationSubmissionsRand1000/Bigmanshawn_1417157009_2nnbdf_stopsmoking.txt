Smoking Nightmares

Do these subside after time?  They seem to be getting more and more prevelant and they are starting to put me on edge and freak me out.  I sometimes wake up really worried that I did smoke.   The overwhelming guilt and anxiety from these nightmares are crazy.

Also day 56, still fighting the cravings and urges.  Easier little bit by little bit, what an EVIL fucking substance nicotine is.

I relapsed on day 25, after getting high, within 30+ hours I smoked some cigarettes,5-15. I restarted the counter and now it's been 73 days and 2 hours that I didn't smoke a single fucking cigarette. And I must admit I'm happy and in peace today. Life is getting better and clearer,

Brain capacities are improving as more O2 in blood stream, less chemical exposure in lunges. I have been trying to quit quit smoking since last 400 Days. Seriously, there has been many attempts and many miserable and silly relapses. Once, I learned and kept giving it another try, it happened. And I am absolutely confident now. I'm going to hit 100 Days before 5 Hours Of New Year. I'm already very excited about it. It's a nice experience when you can enjoy your life without cigarettes, even more. I feel normal again, like, no matter what happens or how irritated I'm, I don't think about cigarettes, my brain is losing the neural network which associates stress to coping mechanism (cigarettes /sugar /etc). And I'm proud of myself.

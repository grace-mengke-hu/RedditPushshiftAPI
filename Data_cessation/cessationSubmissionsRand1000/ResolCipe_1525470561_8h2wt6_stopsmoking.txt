Need to get nicotine out of my system quick

I've been trying to quit for a few months with very little success. The best I've gone was 5 days. This stint has been about 2 days, including today. Here's the problem. I just been been called into an interview for a job that tests for nicotine. Its a hospital job, didn't think I'd get a call back but now here I am. How do I get nicotine out of my system quickly? I have maybe 2 or 3 weeks to accomplish this. 

Tbh I only really smoke where I'm currently working. It's a retail job where it's very easy for me to break down and buy them. If I get out of where I work now I know I can quit for good.  Even though I'm jonesing right now hopes are high. 

Also any advice on getting through a stressful work day without smoking will be welcomed

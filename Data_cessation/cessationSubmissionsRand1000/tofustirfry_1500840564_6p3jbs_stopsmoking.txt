Day 12: No smokes, no drinking, yes weight lifting

Day 12 here and making breakfast with a clear mind. Sleep is still all over the place but enjoying night walks, backpack trips, weight lifting sessions and zero regretful moments. Heading out tomorrow to jump in waterfalls and camp under fruit trees with the dog and girlfriend. Today is prepping the gear and deciding on the food for the trek:-)

Enjoy this Sunday - one which I will not smoke with you on!

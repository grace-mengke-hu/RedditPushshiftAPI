After almost 20 years of smoking, 6 months not a puff!

	I have hit 6 months as a non-smoker.  It’s great!  I feel a lot better even though, I’ve been through a lot of illness and ickiness.  I had a cold for almost two months, enough phlegm to fill a Ford Fiesta hatchback at least once, and times when I wondered if I was just going to forever stay that way. 
	I can say now that it appears I’m getting better and better.  I am shit at exercising, but I do feel I can do it if I want.  My breathing is a lot easier, my blood pressure is down some, heart rate is more stable, sleep is finally better.  Overall health is improved.  
	Do I crave cigs? I smoked for 20 some years.  It was a daily habit, an hourly habit and I guess those impressions on life are hard to get rid of.  So on occasion I get flashbacks of my smoking years.  But, I mostly get them at odd moments, like the other day I picked up a bowl I had discarded egg shells from a hardboiled egg I ate earlier.  The random memory crossed my mind when I would be carrying a bowl or tray of ashes and cigarette butts to the garbage and how utterly messy that was compared to eggshells.  Then I thought about how the ashes got over everything. So I do think about cigs, not in a good way though.
	 I don't like the smell of cigs.  I thought I would always like it, but it turns out I hold my breath and try to get away when I can.
	I really struggled for years to quit.  I was trying to quit at least three years before I finally did.  I wish I knew why this time was the one.  But really all of that three years was part of my process.  All that relapsing and back and forth was part of my journey I guess.  I would have preferred to quit a long time ago, but even though I relapsed dozens of times, that didn’t prevent me from finally quitting for good.

Went to an Oscars party. Got drunk. Didn't smoke!

There were a couple girls there that left about once an hour to go smoke. A month ago I would've joined them every time, or even initiated the trip downstairs and outside to go smoke. Instead I stayed behind with the other non-smokers and held fun conversation during the commercials, and we were there when the show came back from commercial. I looked right at that pack of cigs by the front door every time I went to the kitchen to refill my drink - and felt *nothing!* I had fully expected my inhibitions to cave on me after a couple drinks, but not only did I not have to use willpower, the thought just simply never crossed my mind!

I can't wait for the day when I no longer feel self-congratulatory over not smoking, and it just resonates as every-day life stuff.

Thanks guys.

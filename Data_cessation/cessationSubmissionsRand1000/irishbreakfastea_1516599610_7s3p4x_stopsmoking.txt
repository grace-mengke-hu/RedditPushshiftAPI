Went 7 days cold turkey, had a piece of NRT tonight

Well guys, I hope this is an open minded forum and I don't catch any flack for chewing the gum.  After trying to go cold turkey the past 7 days, I had the most insane withdrawals tonight and decided to chew a piece of 2mg nicotine gum.  I really wanted to go cold turkey guys, but I really wanted to NOT SMOKE even more. I have to say right now, 45 min. after chewing the gum I feel more at ease.  I made the right decision.

I think I put way too much weight on the the Allen Carr method, which says that ANY form of nicotine (patch, gum, lozenge, spray, and so on) is basically asking to fail.  That was a mistake.  I don't want to follow any method that is so all or none.  The most important thing to me is not smoking.  Do you guys have any similar experiences?  At first, I felt like beating myself up but now I think that is stupid.  I have gone 7 FULL days without a single puff of a cigarette and have had two pieces of gum since I quit (one piece on day one and one on day seven). 

I guess I just want to say to anyone out there struggling with cold turkey, it is not the only way.  Anyone who says there is ONE way to quit is being dogmatic.  It might be the best way for you, but for me I needed this.  I was really suffering, more than I could ever imagine.  Crying uncontrollably and feeling scared that I would just give up.  For me, I felt like this was the right decision.  And I am so proud that tomorrow will be day 8.

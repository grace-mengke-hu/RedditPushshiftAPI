Fitness is already improved

I'm 9 days into quitting and I've already taken a full minute PR off both of my regular runs (2.25mi &amp; 5k), and I've been running for over a year. My lungs/breathing itself never held me back, but my muscles would fatigue -- likely, they were not getting efficient oxygen to them, due to the smoking. Now the muscle fatigue sets in wayyyy later in the runs, if at all! It's great motivation to keep the quit going.

I smoked.

I screwed up. After 267 days. I had my baby and I was thinking about smoking quite a bit, feeling like I was going to mess up and start again.  So then I convinced myself the way to avoid starting again was to have one to remind me why I hated them and why I quit in the first place. (Stupidest rationalization. Ever.) So I had one while drinking with one of my smoking friends on Friday night. Then I had 3 more before the end of the night. I haven't smoked since but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't still thinking about it. A lot. I let that stupid monster in. First in the form of romanticizing the cigarette and then through actually smoking. Now instead of feeling like I *might* mess up I'm feeling like I'm pretty damn close to square one. Stupid stupid dumb addiction.

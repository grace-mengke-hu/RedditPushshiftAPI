Dream About Smoking

I had such a vivid dream last night about smoking last night... I think it was because I had driven for 8 hours straight and the entire time all I could think about was how badly I would love to have a cigarette. 

Then in my dream I did and the person with me looked at me and said do you know what you just did?  I said... I do... I just threw 1 month 2 days and 2hrs down the drain.  It was so real... I had to question myself this morning when I woke up.  

I know I didn't smoke and I am so proud of myself for pushing through those cravings.  I know that the moment I rattled off in my dream the exact month, day, time I threw down the drain that I was so incredibly disappointed in myself.  I definitely do not want to feel that disappointment in real life.  

Good luck to everyone and keep pushing through your cravings.  I'm over a month in now and still have the occassional killer craving... but I will not give into it.

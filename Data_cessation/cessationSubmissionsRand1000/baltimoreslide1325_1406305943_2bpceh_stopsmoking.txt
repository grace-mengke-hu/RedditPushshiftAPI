Successes

Yesterday afternoon was awful, but then in the evening, rather than continue to hide, I decided to just go out and do stuff and live my damn life as a nonsmoker. I am a musician and have shows coming up this weekend that will be my first real ones as a nonsmoker, so last night I found a random, crappy music open mic to do, just to test out how the vocal pipes are working, since they've been weird and adjusting, and to see how performance anxiety fares as a nonsmoker.  
  
Everything was fine. I didn't crave a cigarette once.  
  
I even had 2 drinks just to see if I could do it.  
  
There's usually a bunch of awkward social shit that happens after open stage performances, sometimes good and sometimes bad, but when I was younger and doing open stages I avoided this by going out to smoke. This time, I didn't crave a cigarette at all--I just politely dismissed myself when I didn't feel like talking anymore. Actually, since I didn't stand around and smoke, I was less trapped in those interactions.   
  
Took a nice, long walk back to the train; saw lots of smokers and totally didn't feel like doing what they were doing.  
  
I know there will still be tough moments and I have to stay on top of it, but DAMN it was nice to just go out and not worry about it for a while. I really feel like I can conceive of being a nonsmoker who basically never thinks of cigarettes. That's a thing I can do now, I can see it on the horizon. That seemed so impossible so recently! Hang in there, people!  
  
And, truly, you guys have NO IDEA how grateful I am for the support on this sub. Thank you.

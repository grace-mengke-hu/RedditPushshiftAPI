Vaping ?

I watched some videos and read some stuff about Vaping, it "seems" to be "alot" safer than cigarettes.


So its very appealing to me ofcourse and it would banish my "craving" at least, and i could lower nicotine in take after time.


Im not searching for approval, but whats your experience and if its good idea after 4 months, does somebody have same experience ?

Never give up giving up

Started at 15 - unfiltered camels

Read Alan Carr's book four times between 2000 -  2012 

Stopped *except* for social smoking for four years 2004 - 2007. I counted this as quit then, but realize now it was binge smoking. 

Last cigarette ten months ago, and not bought another packet. 

wobbliest on day 3 and after day 10 calmed right down.

*smoked 25 years. Trust me it's way do-able.

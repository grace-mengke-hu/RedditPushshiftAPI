Anyone find they get shortness of breath only when they donâ€™t smoke?

I have smoked a pack a week for years and years, and to be honest I have never really noticed much of an impact on my health. I have no doubt there has been some impact though. That said, anytime I go a few days without smoking I find I get the worst shortness of breath, but if I smoke again it seems to go away. Has anyone noticed this during their quitting process as well? I really want to just stop altogether, but I find this side affect strange.

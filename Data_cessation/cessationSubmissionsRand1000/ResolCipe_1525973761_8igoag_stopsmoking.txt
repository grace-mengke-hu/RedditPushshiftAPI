Made it 6 days and saved 30 bucks

Tbh I can't believe I made it 6 days. i treated myself to a  book I've wanted for a while. Figuring I was aloud to spend 10 bucks. The cravings are there but the cranky feeling isn't as much. My brain is trying to romanticize smoking and I've almost tripped up a few times (yesterday was bad, my brother in law left his pack on the kitchen table and I could've bummed one so easily) but I feel more in control each day. I'm doing my best not to binge on junk food but yesterday I did eat about 6 or 7 cow tales but i mostly eat apples to curb any cravings.

I got angry. I got stressed.

I went for a walk.

I didn't take any money.

Which means I didn't potentially risk myself in the shop.

Which means I wouldn't have the chance to buy a Â£12 pack of cigarettes and smoke one all in one desperate hit as a pathetic excuse to calm myself down.

Which means I wouldn't feel obliged to smoke the rest.

When I'm struggling and need immediate relief - I need to go for a walk without my purse.

First smoking dream

Should I expect more of these? What have yours been like?


Last night I had my first smoking dream. I bought a pack, and all of a sudden, I had zero control over my actions. I wasn't just smoking, I was flying through a pack, in my car of all places (I haven't smoked in my current car ever, and haven't smoked while driving in over a year). 
My dream freaked me out. It was so realistic. I felt ashamed and sad about my lack of control. 

I guess in the end, I'm glad I had it. It was kind of a "hey, you really can't even smoke just one". 

I'm a nicotine addict, but I'm 18 days a non-smoker!

18 days!

I also stopped drinking, but not really due to alcoholism or anything. I just knew that if I drank I’d lose this battle of quitting smoking. Yesterday I had 2 mimosas on a brunch date with my friend, and adding to that I was quite full from salmon egg Benedict!! 

I went home, with a mild buzz, and I was dying for a cigarette. At day 17! 

But I didn’t smoke one. I was good. 

Yayy

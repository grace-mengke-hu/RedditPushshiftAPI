Anyone else been stuffed up since they quit?

I stopped smoking regularly 3 months ago with a few cheats up until the beginning of November (18 cigarettes on 8 occasions)
I know it's cold season but I feel like I've had a mild cold since I stopped. I haven't been able to enjoy the return of smells & taste & although I'm not coughing, my voice is all scratchy.
Is this just all the crap coming out of me? Any idea when I might expect to smell properly again?

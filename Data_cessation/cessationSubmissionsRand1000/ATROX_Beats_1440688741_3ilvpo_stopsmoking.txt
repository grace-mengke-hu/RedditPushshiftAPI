Yesterday, I smoked my last cigarette.

This morning, I threw away all my cigarettes, most of my lighters, my ashtrays, and my roller. It's been about 11 hours since my last smoke and I don't really feel like I need one (although I've tried quitting before, and I know the hardest is usually day 2). Anyway, wish me luck for the next couple weeks. See you on the other side.

Edit: In case anyone cares, I had been smoking about a pack or more per day for about 8 years. Glad to finally be done with it. It's the end of day one and I already notice a difference. I'm still withdrawing pretty hard, but I feel like I can actually breathe, and it's awesome.

Edit 2: It's only day 2 and I already feel much better. I'm still craving like a fiend, but this was the first morning in months where I didn't wake up with chest pains and I wasn't hacking up green shit. I'm already loving this.

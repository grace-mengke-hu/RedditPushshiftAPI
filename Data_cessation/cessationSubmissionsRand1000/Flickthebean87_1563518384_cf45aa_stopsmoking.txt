My dad asked for a nicotine patch at the hospital and the doctor ripped it off after I left. He says the nicotine is the problem. Wtf?! I’m on day 3 and don’t plan on using the patches past day 4. Can someone explain?

I’m a bit upset because my dad has been a 30 year smoker. I get that nicotine in general isn’t good for you, but I don’t agree with this if my dad is only planning on using it for a few days. (To take the edge off) Can anyone explain why he would do this? I figured as far as cigarettes go, all the chemicals are far worse than just the nicotine alone.

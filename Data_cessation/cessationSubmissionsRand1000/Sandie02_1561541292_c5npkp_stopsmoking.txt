Itâ€™s been 12 Days smoke free for me

Hasnâ€™t been easy getting here, have had good and bad days really
Iâ€™m staying strong and smoke free
Joined a gym even and have a savings account now
So what really helped me is a app smoke free and also realizing you canâ€™t just have one
So they taught me, not another puff, no matter what 
It helps
That and faith

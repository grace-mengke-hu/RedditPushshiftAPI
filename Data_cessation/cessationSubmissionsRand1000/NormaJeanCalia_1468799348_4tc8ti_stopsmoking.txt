Need a replacement for my morning smoke. It's the only smoke I love.

My morning routine, that I love. 

4am. Wake. Drink pre workout. 
430. At the gym beast mode with weights til 6. 
615. Poop
630 watch sun rise on my porch. Coffee. And cigar. No kids yelling at me. Phone isn't ringing. No husband discussing bills. No pressure. No demands. Endorphins surging. Muscles ache from growing. Perfect. 

Now I will say I smoke 3-6 times a day.  These little things called Capone cigars.  They have a filter and are the size of a cig. I honestly hate the rest and could less about as long as I have that first peaceful, quite one in the morning. 

I know that even one isn't good. And I need to stop them all. I've quit before and what usually pulls me back is a) stress b)needing a moment alone. That's it honestly. 

I need a way to do my mornings without the first one that I love so much. Advice? Tips? Encouragement? Appreciate it all

Scared to fail again due to weight gain

So I got a prescription for champix which worked really well for me in the past. I have failed previously because I gained so much weight and bloated like crazy! I actually looked 9 months pregnant. For the record, I'm female 114 lbs and am almost 50. I am a closet smoker (don't smoke at work) &amp; basically I'm at the point where I am so sick of smoking I can honestly say I deftest myself for continuing to smoke. It is making me sick tired and broke. Also not gonna lie while on my quit for the month I did indulge in food. I believe the weight gain caused my relapse. I was working out more but we all know that diet is crucial. Also I felt like I was so bored all the time...not much of a fitness buff. Growing up as a child I wasn't really active. Any tips here? This time I want and need for this to be the right time.

I have a question for those who have quit, I want some encouragement

Has anyone else just tried and failed and tried and failed, and what finally made it stick?

I have tried to quit smoking dozens and dozens of times in the last 6 months.  I have made it 7 days here, 3 days there, 2 days, 10 days, etc.  Buying a pack, smoking a few or half and then throwing the rest out.  I have done this so many times I have lost count.

I am beginning to feel really sick and tired of all of this, and I want to make my next quit stick.  I would really like some encouragement.

I really, really want to quit guys.  I have to quit.  There is no other option.  Please share your stories, do you have any that are similar to mine?  What finally did it for you?

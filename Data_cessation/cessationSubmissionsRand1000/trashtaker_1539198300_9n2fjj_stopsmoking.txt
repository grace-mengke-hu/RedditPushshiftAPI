Almost 4 months down and I freaking smoked today

The last couple of days have been hell at work, hell in my personal life, hell in general.  Also, I suffer from depression and it's really been kicking my ass today.  I'm almost 4 months down, but I totally smoked one yesterday and 3 today.  I feel terrible about it.  I feel like a total failure in all aspects in my life.  Any strides I had made are now undone.  You know what?  It didn't taste bad or make me feel worse... I enjoyed it.  The pull is still fucking strong.  How do I cope?  What do I do?  I'm so lost, and I feel really alone and ashamed.

Sorry for this terrible post.  I'm sure this isn't what others who are quitting needed to hear.  I'm just having a very hard time.  I feel like I've let everyone down, especially me....

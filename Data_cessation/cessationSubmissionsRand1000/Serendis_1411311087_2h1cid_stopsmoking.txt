Day 6 - So much better

Day 4 was awful.  By far the hardest day for me - yesterday was Day 5 and I am honestly shocked at how different it was from Day 4.  I had one small craving later in the evening after dinner that was SO EASY to squish.

I know I'm still a long way from being out of the woods, but getting out of the initial rage-stage is a huge relief. I feel great this morning! I can taste a full week free from nicotine tomorrow morning. Woohoo!!!

Managing Mental Health While Quitting?

Major depression is nothing new to me. It came on when I was about eight and has been a constant in my life ever since. For the most part, I've come to accept it and live with it. 

Regular ol' depression is manageable for me. However, nicotine withdrawls seem to trigger something much more difficult: intense urges to self harm. My cravings for a cigarette are actually quite mild: I automatically reach for my pack, realise it isn't there and go 'oh, right'. That's it. 
However, I have this chest aching obsessive desire to make myself bleed. It's really bizarre and frightening. 

I know that it is the cigarettes causing this, and I don't want to use it as an excuse to keep smoking because a habit that causes severe suicidal urges is not a habit I want-- for obvious reasons. 

I was on one week quit and I caved. I have no intention of picking the cigarettes back up, but I need to find an effective means of managing my mental health. 

I do have a counselling appointment scheduled, but that isn't until next month. 

What can I do to keep myself safe in the meantime?

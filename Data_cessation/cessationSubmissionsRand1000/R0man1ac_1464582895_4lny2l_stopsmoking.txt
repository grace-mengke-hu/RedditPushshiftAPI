Resetting AGAIN.

I'm trying not to be too hard on myself. I've been trying to quit now for the last year.

To be fair, I have only smoked about four cigs in the last six months. But I reset every single time I do. Just because I feel like I am lying to myself and to others if I don't.

I'm still proud of the progress I've made. I still feel better. I'm still working out, and running. I used to smoke a pack a day. It's been rough for me to just not smoke ONE. 

I went for about five months and smoked one. Reset the badge. Went another two and a half. Reset the badge. Resetting again at two weeks.

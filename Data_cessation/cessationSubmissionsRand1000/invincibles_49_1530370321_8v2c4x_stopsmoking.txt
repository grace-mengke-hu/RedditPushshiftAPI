Need some help on perspective

Hi. I quit smoking 21 days ago. I was one of those devoted smokers, 20 to 30 a day, smoked alone and really enjoyed the silence rather than the cigarettes. Finally managed the effort to quit. Now, even though it's been 3 weeks and despite knowing all the mind games I feel a great sense of boredom. I need someone to tell me that it passed for them and describe it a little to me. You would understand what I am asking for if u were a smoker like me.

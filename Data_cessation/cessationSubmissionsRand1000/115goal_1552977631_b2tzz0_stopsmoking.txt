After a relapse, it’s been hard to quit again but this morning I smoked my last for good.

I was smoke free for 60 days before giving in two weeks ago and I came here to moan about it, and while I was inspired by the community, I still couldn’t seem to go more than 24 hours without smoking.

But today I woke up and smoked one cigarette before going to my new job and I was thinking about how tired and terrible I feel, and so I started to search up reasons to quit again. 

Guys: I’m officially a non smoker. This is my truth and I demand to stick by it. I’m not even gonna let this be a struggle. I refuse. It’s all in the brain and I’m the boss of this brain so!!!! No more funny business. 

Wish me luck x

DAY ONE. I'm Gonna Need You People.

Hi everyone, i just started posting on here a couple days ago and I just never realized how much I really needed some support til now. 
I have always been the stubborn, lone-wolf type who figured it all out on her own. I can't do that now. It never worked and so now I am gonna do this. 

Like I said in an earlier post, I have suffered from depression my whole life and that dopamine hit is the main reason why i can't stop. Scratch that, DIDN'T stop. 

So, I quit smoking Sunday, had a nervous breakdown Sunday night and last night fell off the wagon. Normally that would make me push my quit date to the next Sunday- nice little trick, I've played it for months!!!!
But not this time. I am getting back on the wagon and I am going to use this resource and lean on you complete strangers. Because I realize you GET IT. I don't think, my whole life, I have taken this addiction as seriously as I do now. I realize, after Sunday, that this is a real, brazen, stealthy enemy who will pimp-talk me into killing myself any way it can. 
This shit is going to be hard. 
Also i curse alot. I hope everyone can deal with that. 
Most of all I want to get through this so that I can eloquently put people straight, just like a handful of users have already done to me, and I can't thank enough. If i could one day help someone out a tenth of the help I have already received in these scant few days I would have felt it was all worth it. 
Thank you to everyone ahead of time, and I will learn how all this works, karma etc, so if I am not giving proper cred I still haven't figured it all out. In more ways than one. I'll get there. We all will. 

Thank you.

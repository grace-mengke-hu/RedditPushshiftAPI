I need help. Give me a specific reason you want to quit smoking.

I’m around the one month mark and I cannot stop wanting give up.  It would be so easy to drive to the corner and just give up.  It feels to me that if I’m having a day like today after 4 weeks, then this is my new normal.  I’m just going to feel moody and on edge and physically uncomfortable for the rest of my damn life...or I give up and smoke.

Remind me why we all wanted to quit other than the obvious things like avoiding lung cancer.

I’ll even start.  Long flights.

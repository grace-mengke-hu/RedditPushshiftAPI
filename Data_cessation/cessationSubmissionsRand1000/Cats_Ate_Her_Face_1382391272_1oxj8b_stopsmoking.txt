Having trouble slogging through Easy Way...any advise?

I quit last year for about 6 months.  It actually went pretty well, withdrawal-wise, but I stupidly started up again.  I tried quitting again this past July, and went about 2 months. This go-around I had HORRIBLE withdrawal symptoms; headaches, serious depression, anger, and other things that I've just blocked out at this point.

I decided that I'm going to try doing the Easy Way method.  I went to the library and got the book...and I just can't get into it.  I'm a pretty voracious reader.  I just can't get into his style, and he feels too fake-humble.  

Can someone smack some sense into me?

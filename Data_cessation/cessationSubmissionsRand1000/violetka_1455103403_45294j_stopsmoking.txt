embarking on my 7th day

Hi everyne. I am starting my 7th day...so have made it almost a week. Yesterday and today I have horrible cravings of just having one.  I keep resisting this urges, but i think thta i must work on my inner deep motivation, so that i can be sure to chase these thoughts away. I keep telling myself "the more you smoke the harder it will be to quit". I also try to focus on the negative aesthetic effects, such as skin, hair, teeth, and most importantly--lungs. I am a very vain person so I think a little "it ages you 20 years" can't hurt. Mostly Itry not to resist the craving but to relax in it and breathe and tell myself that it will pass and reaffirm "I choose not to smoke today". It is like a death of a person. "The cigarettes have died, they have passed away. You may miss them, but they are not comming back and you just have to live with it and power through it." (I am sorry if this is too cynical for some -comparing cigarettes to a person, but it helps me)
I have no idea why yesterday and today I am having such a hard time compared to previous days...

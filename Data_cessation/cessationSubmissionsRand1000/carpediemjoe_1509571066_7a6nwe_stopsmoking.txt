â€œFor more than 40 years, cigarette companies have been banned from advertising on TV. That's about to change. In a bid to punish the companies for purportedly hiding the risks associated with smoking, they'll soon have to run new ads that warn of the risks. The ads are part of a settlement to a lawsuit. Unlike the anti-smoking ads we've seen from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the Truth campaign by the American Legacy Foundation, the twist of the knife here is that the tobacco companies themselves will be producing and paying for them, and the message they'll be delivering is a stark one: The cigarette giants were essentially trying to kill you all along. Beginning in late November, both Altria (NYSE: MO) and British American Tobacco (NYSE: BTI) will run ads that are between 30 and 45 seconds long that explain to viewers via voiceover that "Altria, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, Lorillard, and Philip Morris USA intentionally designed cigarettes to make them more addictive." According to The Wall Street Journal, another ad acknowledges, "More people die every year from smoking than from murder, AIDS, suicide, drugs, car crashes, and alcohol, combined."

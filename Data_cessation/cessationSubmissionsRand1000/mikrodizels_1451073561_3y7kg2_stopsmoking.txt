I want to smoke due to nostalgia. Help!

The Carr's book refuted everything i had in my mind...but damn. I remembered the ''good old days''. I wanted to take myself back to those times. A lot of good stuff happened then and i smoked in that time period. You know what i'm talking about. I smoked for a good while. Thats the only thing the book did not talk about, and I have this feel that I could smoke and remember them. Please knock some sense in me.  
I bought a pack of smokes. **I smoked one**, did not feel good. Should I toss them away, or should I go through with the pack and relisted the audiobook. I just don't know anymore. Perhaps something did not gel with me. I need advice.

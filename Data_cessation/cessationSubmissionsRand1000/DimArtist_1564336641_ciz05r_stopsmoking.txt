I failed but I will try again (PLEASE HELP)

I was smokefree for 36 hours. In these hours I was feeling sleepy and frustrated. I didn't have any energy at work and I was feeling depressed when instead of going to the smoking lounge to take my break like I used to I went to places where I was feeling incredibly isolated and sad.

Last night I had a severe craving and I had some kind of quaver in my body while I was sleeping. My crush smokes 5 cigarettes a day, she can control it and I envy her for that.

The biggest obstacle for me was to change habits in my daily life. I was feeling so much prepared. I had confidence. When I lit the cigarette I started crying.

I don't have the money anymore to smoke. I feel so much pressure that I can not handle it. I don't want every day of my life to be like that. Yes, I want to stop but not to feel so miserable. All this time I was feeling gloomy and my mind was stuck in the cigarette

So, what should I do? Limit the amount of cigarettes that I smoke? Take NRT gums and spray? Quit cold turkey again? And yes I have read Allen Carr's book and it helps but the addiction seems to win.

I wish I could upload a screen shot of the app to tell you I am fine but I am not.

I don't know if it's mental or physical but I think it's both. 

I want your help. Please.

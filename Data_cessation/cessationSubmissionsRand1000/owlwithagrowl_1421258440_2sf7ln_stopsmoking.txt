120 days = 4 stars = ~1200 cigs not smoked = ~$300 saved.

I love my new smoke-free life which still sucks at times but at least I am not killing myself anymore with those cancer sticks. I never thought this possible after 30 years of smoking and umpteenth attempts to quit. Also a big thanks to the /r/stopsmoking community. Y'all are great!

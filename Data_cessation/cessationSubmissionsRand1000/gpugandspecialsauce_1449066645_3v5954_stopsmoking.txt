Major relapse

No excuses. I was weak. 

I relapsed on Thanksgiving while we had family and friends in town who all smoke. I'm stopping again today. 

Now to figure out how to handle Christmas with the same people around. These people will not refrain from smoking around me and I can't really avoid them unless I want to spend Christmas alone. I've had so much depression going on this last year that I don't think a solo Christmas is a good idea.  

Thoughts? Tips? Suggestions? 

Also- how do I get a new ticker?

Smoking dream.

I’ve just had my first smoking dream in forever. It was crazy, I had a cigarette in my hand, sitting out side the back and I said to myself no I don’t want this. i ended up lighting it and having one puff and then decided to put it out feeling stupid for losing 20+ days. I then walked back inside. in my dream I heard myself say “ it’s just a dream go and enjoy your smoke”  then went back outside and had another one. I’m glad dream me is enjoying them lol. I woke up and laughed, no cravings the last 4 days and no more missing the habit. Nice try brain but apparently my subconscious is on board this time.

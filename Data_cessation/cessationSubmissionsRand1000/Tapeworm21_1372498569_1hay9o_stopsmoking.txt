You're making it harder than it is. Here's why.

So you just quit smoking.  Well done!  Unfortunately, you're reading threads on r/stopsmoking saying how after 2ish years the person caved in and went right back to the habit. 

Well guess what?!

Not all of us caved in.  We stayed quiet, did what needed to be done in life,  and you never heard about it.  We are the other half.  We read threads about how someone else smoked a cigarette after 8 months.  We refuse to do so and lack any interest to follow suit. 

Bottom line... I'm sick of reading threads on how you caved.  You're weak.  

Those of us who continue the struggle are happy too.  You're not the first one to fight this fight.  Trust me.

100 Days of Freedom

To anyone on day 1 or just thinking of quitting, YOU CAN DO IT!  Just over 100 days ago I picked up The Easy Way to Stop Smoking by Alan Carr.  Since reading it I haven't so much as thought of smoking.  I can go out drinking all night and not smoke.  I can go for a run and breathe.  I spent much less time outside in the cold.  My car smells better.  I don't have to wash my sweatshirts as often.  I have more room in my pockets.  I don't have to worry about running out of cigarettes.  I don't have to be the only one to go outside.  If one person reading this can post a similar post in 100 days that would make this all worth it.

Choose to live and breathe freely.  NOT ANOTHER PUFF!

It actually DOES get easier

Wow. So I'm 33 days in (actually had to check), and I don't really think about smoking much anymore. Maybe a little craving every other day. In fact the only reason I posted this is because I realised I'm still subscribed to this sub.

Basically this is just a boost for anyone at the beginning who's struggling! It actually DOES become easier and much less of a big deal day by day. It's just a gradual ramp down into not caring so you don't notice until you're through the nasty stuff.

I'm not naive enough to think "oh I'm totally fine now forever", but the hardest bit (those first two weeks especially) feels like a distant memory.

So to all who are about to quit or those just in it: chin up because it does really improve! Good luck and put in that effort!

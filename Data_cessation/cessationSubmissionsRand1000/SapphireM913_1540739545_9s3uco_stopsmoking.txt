It feels good when people root for you

I'm nearly 3 months in, I feel like I've finally got this licked. My neighbor also works at the gas station down the street where I used to always buy my packs. We'd also see each other outside the apartment when we took our breaks, or when we'd come home for the day, etc. I came home recently and she said "did you quit? You're never out here anymore." Yes ma'am I did!! So yesterday I went to get gas and went inside to buy a Powerball ticket. I'd been doing pay at the pump so I wasn't tempted by going inside. She was there, and she looked at me and said "I'm not selling you cigarettes!!!" It's really good to know that even if I did have a moment of weakness, falling back into my old habits would be even more difficult.

The last record

Previously, my longest span of non-smoking before relapsing was 4 months. That was over 10 years ago. I just realized that I broke that record some time ago. Since my very first cigarette at age 17, this is the longest I've gone without one.

I believe I got it this time.

Actually, the title of this post isn't entirely correct. There is one more record to beat - those 17 years of non-smoking I started my life out with. See you guys in 2033 ;)

As always, thanks /r/stopsmoking.

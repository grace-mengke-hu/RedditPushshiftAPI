I’m really bad at this :/

I thought it would be easier having medication this time. I thought I was feeling stronger than before. Then I woke up this morning in a panic - today’s the day!

Hell, I didn’t even make it to breakfast! I want this so bad, I want to be healthy and not wasting money on poison. But I just get in such a state when I realise I can’t smoke anymore. 

Right now I’m just pushing myself as far as I can go without smoking... but I am still smoking :( Tomorrow is another day, I guess. 

Sorry for the vent, I just didn’t know where else to go with it. I really hope you’re all having more success than me because failing at this sucks!

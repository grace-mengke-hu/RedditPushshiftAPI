Anyone else feeling better mentally/emotionally 2+weeks in???

First week was rough and my depression was noticeably worse, but I'm closing in on two weeks and i have found that my depression seems to be lifting. Anxiety seems better too. Every time i overcome a major craving, get through something without smoking, and learn new coping mechanisms that work for me i am healing myself mentally. The pride and sense of accomplishment have helped me to feel happier and more mentally clear and positive. The fog has lifted. I'm feeling great, really solid in my quit and i have not been this perky and sociable in years. Loving life as a non smoker!!!!

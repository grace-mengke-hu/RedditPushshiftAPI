Oh My Days! 3 weeks after 9 years

I have had headaches,insomnia,fatigue,cold symptoms, a cough, very very very bad anxiety for about 5 days during week 3. Yesterday I woke up and felt a different person and today I feel like a different person like somebody who has been missing for 7 years. Hopefully quitting smoking defeats anxiety for good. About to go to work and actually looking forward not afraid of freaking out. Side note I have put on about 11 pounds in 3 weeks haha! I have eaten like a pig I was hungry every 2 hours but now that's under control. I used to be a very fit (looking) 210-220 pounds guy who played rugby,squash and liftting weights. Over the last 2.5 years I stopped that and didn't do any sport and over the last 6 months I realized how impactful the smoking was in relation to trying to get fit again! I hadn't really noticed before with always playing various sports. I'm currently a 235 fatty so I don't care I put on the extra 11 pounds (looking forward to joining the positive body image thread/before and after pics and becoming a sexy mofo) Never again will I smoke because for first time in years I feel happy as normally even when I'm having the time of my life when i light up every 45 minutes the guilt is so much. Looking forward to playing soccer this week and not having an anxiety attack and I can't wait to start jogging. OH! and I cannot wait to have an extra what 4,000 in my bank account to travel more! I'm currently travelling and I have done that with like 4,000 a year less than I should have. Disgusting

p.s still got slight aching gums/toothache. Anyone on the week 2/3 blues don't give up and I'll still use this sub every day for a long time but hopefully I don't need to put any anxiety posts up myself just help other people.

Questions about setting a quit date

So, I stopped drinking. My last drink was on Feb 9th. My thinking is, I'll be prepared enough to stop smoking on April 9th, after two months of sobriety.

Has anyone here used to quit date? Where they successful? Did quitting come accidentally, without notice?

What sort of thing should I expect, besides just the cravings? What is this quitters flu I keep reading about?

Do people quit better cold turkey? Or using nicotine patches or the like?  Any personal experiences?

What resources have you found helpful? 

This time needs to stick. I absolutely cannot keep living this way.

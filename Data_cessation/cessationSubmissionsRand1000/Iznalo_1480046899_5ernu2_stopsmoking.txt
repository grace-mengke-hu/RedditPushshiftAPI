Thankful to be a non-smoker. 200 days today!

It's been a journey - very difficult at first but so much easier now. I still get the very very occasional craving but it's quick and manageable and usually when I am drinking. I continue to remind myself not one puff ever! 

Thanks to this sub for all the reinforcement.....looking forward to the one year mark!!!  Happy Thanksgiving!!!

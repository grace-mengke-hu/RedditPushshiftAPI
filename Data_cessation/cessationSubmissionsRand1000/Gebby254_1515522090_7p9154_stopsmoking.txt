There are a lot of new people here due to the time of year and I wanted to tell you all that I am cheering for you and that it IS possible.

My biggest tips for success were... 

1) Keep the matra "Not one more puff. Not ever" alive inside you.  Sometimes you need to battle for a day... sometimes a minute.  Live by that rule.  It's the one thing that you cannot break, no matter what.

2) Treat yourself to ANYTHING else for the first two weeks.  Want that double bacon burger you never let yourself get?  Have it for lunch today!  Who cares?!? It isn't a smoke!  It helps to look forward to things besides smoking.  Do whatever it takes.

3) Go for a walk or jog after a few days.  It's amazing what some fresh air after you stop feels like.  The feeling will justify why you are quitting.

4)  Check this sub and check it often.  Refuel you mind for the fight.

Go get 'em guys.  This was the best decision of your lives.

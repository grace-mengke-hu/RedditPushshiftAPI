Partner is starting to take up smoking again

I'm still smoke free after a minor slip up. It strengthend me to stay on my quit and never let that happen again. The problem is my partner is starting up again. First one. Then two. Now a box. And saying the same excuses I use to say. I will be fine. I will stop tomorrow. 

My main issue is the smell is soooo bad. I hate it. I woke up today feeling like I had smoked by receiving second hand smoke. I said to my partner no smoking at least 30mins before bed. I'm worried that it will bring my cravings back or that everyday will become a withdrawal.

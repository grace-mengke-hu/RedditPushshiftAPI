Day 12 complete

Cravings are gone. I am not worried about cravings anymore. But I had [shortness of breath, tightness in chest](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/4g0uhh/trouble_breathing_after_10_days_of_quitting/) and little chest pain in the last 2 days. I went to a doctor to be on the safe side ant got x-rays done. Nothing wrong and everything is fine. I guess, since it started after I quit smoking, I think these are side effects of the lungs cleansing itself. There's no other explanation. Anyway, I am fine, and I think I should not be hypochondriac and worry about every little thing. I am getting little phlegm too, with no cold. Probably the mucus is coming out of lungs. Anyway, I am doing great with cravings gone. 

I was running daily and stopped it on Day 11 worried about shortness of breath. But I read online that I should continue cardio and try to breathe deeply to help lungs heal itself? Is that true? Thanks for reading.

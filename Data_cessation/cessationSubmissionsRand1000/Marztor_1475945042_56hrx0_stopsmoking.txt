Accidentally weirded out a smoker by following behind them a little too close

5 days in and walking along the street behind a smoker. 
It was only when they turned round and said "can I help you?" that I realised I was way too close. 
Red face and hasty apology later I realised they had been smoking my preferred brand of cigarettes (Marlboro lights (gold, whichever). I didn't cave and ask for one though

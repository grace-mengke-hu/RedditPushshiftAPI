Back at it again

Iâ€™ve posted multiple times. This time HAS to be the time I quit. To prepare myself, Iâ€™ve set my quit date to be tomorrow. I downloaded the Smoke Free app. I have a buddy to quit with (my mom ðŸ˜Š) and I know both of us will be successful. We have to be. 

Iâ€™ll be back to post progress updates. Iâ€™m also forcing myself to post when I have a bad craving or feel like Iâ€™ll lapse. I need to do this. I donâ€™t want to be unhealthy anymore. My chest hurts in the morning from smoking, I have a persistent phlegmy cough, and I smell like an ashtray.

Thank you for listening and I look forward to posting more! Have a fantastic holiday!

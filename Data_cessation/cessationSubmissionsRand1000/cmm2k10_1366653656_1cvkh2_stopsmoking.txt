Two Weeks Today.. and TIL

Well I have officially made it 2 weeks today. After smoking a pack a day for 15 years I feel pretty damn good about it! I haven't died from not smoking yet and I haven't killed anyone either so we are on the right path. However, TIL that smokers stink.... Today was the first day I was in a public place and a girl walked by me and man she smelled horrible... I want to say "I never smelled like that, that girl just has chain smoked for days on end and hasn't showered" but.. we all know that is bullshit I did smell like that... EWWWWW
Here is to never smelling like that again!

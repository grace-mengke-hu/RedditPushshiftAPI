I'm 3 weeks quit yay for me, but now what?

My question is for anyone that quit after a long smoking habit of like 30 years and then post-quit,  not knowing what to do with themselves? I would love to be one of those people that suddenly loves the gym but if I'm being completely honest, that likely won't happen. I also think I need to define who I am without cigarettes. Any recommendations on books or even exercise programs for the quitters?

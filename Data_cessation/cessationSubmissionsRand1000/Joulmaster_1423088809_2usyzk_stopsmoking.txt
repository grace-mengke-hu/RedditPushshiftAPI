Hey successful non-smokers, could you do something to help those of us struggling or just starting out?

I have attempted to quit more time's than I can count. Sometime's I will make it about 2 weeks and everything FEELS so different. Even walking feels different like there's more kinetic energy just within my body without smoking. Anyway, Could you maybe describe some of the best parts of how you felt now that you have quit? Thing's that stuck out that smoking made you forget.

Quitting smoking New year's resolution

Quit smoking on New year's day after smoking 30 years!  On day 6 and it's really starting to kick in good. I started with a 21 mg patch but it made me really sick, throwing up sick so I switched to the 7mg patch. Used it a couple of days but it was giving me bad headaches. The past couple of days, just been using nicotine gum for cravings. Not too bad. I find the evenings are harder after dinner and the rest of the night since I used cigs as a way to relax. I went through 3 pieces of gum tonight, quick!  It was tough. I was at one point sweating for a cigarette. Dang. I finally got up and took a long bath and that helped a lot. Back to craving, not as bad now but I feel a little ting like I want one. I really want to do this and have tried several times before. Longest I have ever gone is a month. I hope I can go longer and get rid of them for good.  One big secret is not having any butts around and no cigs around, or else I would have been done and back to it. I'm thinking I may should go back to the patch so I don't get in trouble like I did tonight. I came very close to caving in but I made it barely. Again, helps not having them around at all. I'm having night sweats too, waking up in sweat and with a sore throat every morning, blowing my nose a lot in the morning and blood coming out, never seen that before in the mornings. Feeling hot inside my body where my lungs are during the day. I have periods throughout the day where I feel really good and very different but I like it. I wonder if that is how it will one day feel at the end of all this

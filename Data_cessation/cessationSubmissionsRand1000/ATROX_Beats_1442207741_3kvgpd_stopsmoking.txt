Since I've quit, my anxiety has really subsided.

When I was still smoking 1.5 packs a day, I was having panic attacks left and right, sometimes needing as many as 3 doses of Ativan per day. Don't get me wrong, the medicine worked to stop the anxiety, but after a day of 2 or more doses, I'd feel really tired and distant and disinterested for a day or two. But in the last 18 days, I've only had 2 panic attacks, and they were both in the first week of my quit. It feels so good to not have to worry about each day's inevitable panic episode. 

I still have some social anxiety to deal with, but it's not causing me to have debilitating panic attacks anymore. It kind of seems like just a moderate annoyance now, and I'm taking steps towards learning to get over it. I've actually found myself interacting with other people, sometimes even going *out of my way* to do so even if I feel sort of uncomfortable, something I would never have done before. I would never have guessed that quitting smoking would have made me feel this good.  Now the only things left to overcome are the residual smoker's cough I have and the little bit of weight I've gained since I quit. :p

All this is to say that quitting smoking will not only do wonders for your physical health, but it will also massively improve your mental health as well. I feel more free than I've ever felt, and it's because nicotine is not controlling my life anymore. Cheers to all those quitting with me! And to those who need to one final nudge to take the plunge, let this be it. Quit smoking and get your life back! :)

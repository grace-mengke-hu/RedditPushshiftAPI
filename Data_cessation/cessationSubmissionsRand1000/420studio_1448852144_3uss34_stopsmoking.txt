2 months

Officially 2 months nicotine free, 300 dollars saved and over 900 cogs not smoked. still have cravings sometimes and I still think about cigs daily but it sure is a hell of a lot easier than it was a month ago. Time is flying by and I feel like I'm officially over smoking and that feels amazing. I need to start losing this weight though...

Anyways wanted to say thanks to this community I wouldn't have lasted at all without you. This is still my go to for when I crave badly and I appreciate everything this sub does.

My excitement is beating the habit!

So I posted, I don't even know how long ago, about how I was fed up and not going to use any supporting aides in my endeavour to quit smoking. I lied. My 10th day free of cigarettes will be successful as of this Friday, and that day is my birthday. I only came to the conclusion today thinking about how I succeeded the 7th day and am about to enter day 8. I am absolutely ecstatic.

I will honestly admit, vaping has helped me a lot with the habit. Standing outside waiting for my bus in a crowd of smokers, admittedly, not the most comforting situation, but I didn't have an urge to ask someone for a smoke or to go buy any. The excitement of not being a smoker as of 10 days on my birthday is thrilling enough to not have one. I'm happier than ever. 

Thank you /r/stopsmoking you're a powerful supportive community. Inspirational!

Setback :(

I went out last night and apparently I smoked.  Does it really count if I don't remember it though?  I mean, obviously it does for addiction purposes but, it hasn't changed how I feel about quitting and I still feel confident that I can quit.  I can't stop beating myself up over the 2 hits I had last night.

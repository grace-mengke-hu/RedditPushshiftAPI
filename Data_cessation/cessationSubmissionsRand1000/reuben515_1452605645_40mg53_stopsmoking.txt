90 days! Its easier but its not over

90 days today, and I'm psyched. 

It's so much easier, but I've quit for almost 5 years before.  I know how easy it is to slip up. After all that time as a nonsmoker, I went right back to a pack a day within 6 months of the first drunken puff.  It's really all about not starting again, no matter what.

Looking back at the past 48 days ...

I think the hardest thing I did was to take the decision to really stop, and  to be absolutely sure about it. Once I had done that, everything else was just the logical conclusion of that decision being played out in front of me. I feel so fantastic, healthy, and liberated. I wish everyone could feel this way. After 20+ years of a pack a day, I now know for sure that I'll never have to smoke again.

Please, make that decision. Stop today. You can be 7 days nicotine free next week, and live a long a happy life without an addiction clouding your judgement and choices.

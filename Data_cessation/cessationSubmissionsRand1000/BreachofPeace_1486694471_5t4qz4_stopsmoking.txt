I just discovered the gifs in the Smoke free app

After using the app for almost a year, I just noticed the gifs that appear when you "tap when you have completed" the missions.

The new amusement and encouragement is so helpful right about now.

Disclaimer: I haven't actually been quit for almost a year...more like a month (and countingðŸ˜ƒ)...gonna make it this time.

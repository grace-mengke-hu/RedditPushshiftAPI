I tired of quitting quitting

I quit on Jan 1st and did not smoke for 6 months; however, last  month I relapsed. It has been horrible ever since. All my attempts to quit smoking have failed. Don't know how I did it the first time but it seems like no matter what I do my brain finds a way to justify smoking. I tired of this. I am quitting and this time I am going to stay quit. Wish me luck!

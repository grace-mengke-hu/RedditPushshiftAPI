I can't stay quit.

I'm 22 and I've quit 3 times already, in the past year. The first time lasted about a month, second time two months, third time I made it to four days. I don't understand why my willpower is so weak. I have tried different things to distract myself, to help cope with things (exercise, watching tv, drinking a bottle of water, a nap, etc) and it'll work for a little bit, but then that technique kind of dies and stops working. I smoked two cigarettes last night, and they made me feel...dirty. Like, my body felt unclean and just kind of gross? I can't seem to stay quit. If anyone has any advice on how they did it, please, help.

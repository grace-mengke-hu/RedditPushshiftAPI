Just feeling so blah - not even sure it's the (lack of) smoking

Honestly, I'm not exactly sane under the best of circumstances, so these feelings are nothing new.  I'm still using nicotine via a vape, so I'm still getting the 'important' drug and the action.  For some reason, though, I just feel so out of sorts.  Almost disconnected from everything.  I'm not really craving the real thing, all that much anyway, though the thought is crossing my mind a lot more the past couple days than it has the past couple weeks.  

Apparently it's been seven weeks since I quit - I've cut my nicotine intake by over half, including going nicotine free at night and when I first wake up.  I'm still proud of myself, mostly for the money saved, but I just feel a lot...  foggier? than I have in awhile.  Again, it's totally possible that it's just part of my normal mental health cycle, but since it coincides with me thinking about cigarettes a lot, I can't help but think its related.

Not sure what I was going for here except a chance to vent some of these mixed up thoughts and perhaps find some solidarity in other quitters.  Strength to us all!

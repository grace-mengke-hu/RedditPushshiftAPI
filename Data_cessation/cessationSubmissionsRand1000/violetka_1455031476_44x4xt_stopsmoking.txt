my day 6! of not smoking is beginning

I am beginning my day 6. I have may cravings strangely enough. Most of them psychological. I kee thinking of having just one. Another thing is that "oh it is so easy to quit, just have one and quit again". Now the most dangerous part of the journey starts ---the one where the addicted mind starts to appeal to you using vanity and arrogance. "oh you have such a strong will. just having one cig wont do anything to you. you can always quit. you are the queen of you". Fuck you mind, and piss off with your lies. If t is so easy to quit how come i am smoking after os many years? How come I am not at all living the life of an athlete/dancer/yoga whatever, but of a sad chubby smoker?

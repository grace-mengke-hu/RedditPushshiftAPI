I think I'll feel sad when I quit

Today is my last day smoking. I set this date when I quit drinking (two months ago) because I was worried putting down the bottle would be more difficult for me than it ended up being. I used those two months to emotionally prepare to quit smoking.

To prep myself mentally, I am reading Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking today, cover to cover. I'm a little past halfway through right now.

Interestingly, as I began to write this post, I realized stopping drinking was easy. I had no more desire to drink. I had lost that desire, and had realized that all of my reasons to drink were excuses to avoid what I actually wanted to do, but was afraid to do. The moment on the morning of February 10th that I made the decision to live sober, I had lost all of that fear.

Back to today - halfway through the book, and I am recognizing that I used the past two months to prepare myself to face my fear of quitting smoking. Fear was the emotion for which I needed to prepare.

Fear. 

I think when I put down that final cigarette later today, I'll feel sad. I think when I remember tomorrow morning that I am not smoking, I'll feel sad as well.

But for some reason, it feels like a good sadness. Like the type of sadness that happens when you experience intense, emotional relief. That type of sadness that makes you happy to be sad, because for once you're being honest with yourself.

I'm sure I'll be posting more in the near future, but I don't know if I'll directly address this post... Right now my posts today are more of a log of my emotions and thoughts than subjects to be discussed at set times in the future.

:) I look forward to joining you on the other side, the happy side, of life. Even if I get sad that it took me so long.

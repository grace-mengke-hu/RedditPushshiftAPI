"Find something else to suck on?" - my Doctor

I went to the doctor for what I thought was a sinus infection, because my ears were really sore. She told me that it wasn't a sinus infection, my ears were fine.

The post nasal drip I was experiencing was not from a sinus infection, but from a combination of acid reflux (which is part of why I quit) and smoking cessation; something about my nose hairs. She told me that all the gum I was chewing was putting all kinds of pressure on my jaw joint (thing?) and causing THAT to inflame which leads to some low-grade ear throbs, which was also exacerbated by my increased caffeine take and losing nicotine's ability to process caffeine quicker; PLUS all of the hard nuts (lul) I was eating as a coping mechanism because I like to impulse chew and didn't want to eat potato chips because... well they're potato chips.

The things I was doing to improve my health were hurting me.

Of course, she said "OBVIOUSLY the bigger part of this is that you keep not smoking, but maybe find something else to suck on?"

I liked smoking... but I like not smoking more.

Sooo what do y'all suck on? (SFW plz)

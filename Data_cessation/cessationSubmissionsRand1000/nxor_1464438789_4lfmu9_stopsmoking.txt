Failed, again. I am worried that I can't get past this.

Spent a week enjoying the non-smoking person I was until Friday end of finals and I had a few smokes and a lot of drinks. I was so happy being a non-smoker and working out every second day, and I am infinitely disappointed that I once again succumbed. As a result I am worried that I will keep going through this cycle and never really be free.

How did you get past this? I have read Easy Way twice. :(

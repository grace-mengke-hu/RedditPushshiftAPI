50 hours in.. Feeling Success

Doing pretty well my first 2 days (cold turkey, 10 year smoker), took a lot of the advice I found here including reading about nicotine, watching the youtube video (I put it on when I go to sleep) drinking juice, suckers, gum, sunflower seeds, and using this community as support and I personally feel I have what it takes to quit this nasty shit. I've made it through 3+ hour drive, stressful job interview and a dentist appointment which always freaks me out. Hell Yes.

I have also found that changing my daily routine up has been a huge help. IE: backing in instead of pulling in to my parking spot, drinking tea instead of coffee and not drinking it in my car, listening to smooth jazz constantly, and even switching where I normally sleep. All these things and zero cigarettes make me feel I have a new life and a jump in my step. We'll see if I continue these antics as I begin my non-smoker life! Thanks for reading.

DR-TL: All the recommended tips on this subreddit and changing up my routine has been a huge success so far

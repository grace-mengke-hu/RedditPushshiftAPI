It's the Little Things

Since I've quit smoking 8 months ago I've had just a couple of urges to pick back up but they last just a few minutes. 

To keep me back on track I think of the small things that make me so grateful I quit in the first place. 

I don't smell bad. I pass by people who smell so bad from smoking and I think "did I smell that bad?!"

I don't feel like I HAVE to have something to calm me down. I just don't get stressed like I did. It's like it made me more stressed. 

I don't have to worry about getting smokers wrinkles.

And the biggest reason I'm glad is that **I hate bugs and I hate heat. It's been a super buggy summer and and super hot summer here so I'm so thankful I don't have to avoid bugs in the dead of the heat.**

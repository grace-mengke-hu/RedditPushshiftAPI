You will have good days and bad days

I am now at 78 days. After the first week I didn't really have a problem. I made it through panic attacks and stress at work. Recently I have been having major cravings. It's hard. It sucks because I have made it this far and I hoped this would all be over. It gets easier, but every now and then you may get hit with this weird craving. Just take a deep breath, focus on what you have accomplished, and come here and post about it. I can do this. We can all do this.

How I used patches to sucessfully quit. (How I relapsed three years later is subject of a post in r/stupid)

When I quit last time, about 4 years ago, I decided to try patches. I asked my pharmacist, who calculated the dosage from the number of cigarettes I smoked a day. She explained that I should use the higher dosage for a month, the medium dosage for the second month and the low dosage for the last month. The prospect of dragging the quitting  process for over three months did not appeal to me. 

Since I had quit once before, I knew that the worst for me were the first three days, and then the following week. I decided to tweak the patch method as follows:


I bought and used the intermediate dosage, instead of the higher dosage which was recommended, and only for three days.

The fourth day  I put one patch in my wallet, to be used in case of an urge. I threw it away after a month and was smoke-free for over three years until I was stupid enough to start again.

My rationale was that I wanted to lower the impact of physical withdrawal the first three days, which are the worst, by lowering the nicotine intake, and at the same time dissociate the nicotine from the oral reinforcements.  After the third day, I did the actual quit, but with a much lower nicotine content in my body, and with a safety net in my pocket.

It worked for me.


This time I'm cold turkeying.  11 days in and quite fine. Only the occasional mini urge in social smoking settings.

By the way, one powerful concept when quitting and getting an urge, is: "When getting an urge think of what happens if you don't smoke that cigarettte...

NOTHING! you just keep on breathing normally!  (instead of self suffocating)

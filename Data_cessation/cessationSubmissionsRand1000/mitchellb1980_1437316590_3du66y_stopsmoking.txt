Smug proud feeling...

Was at a friends helping side a garage yesterday, and his Mother in law stopped by she's a pack a day smoker. He mentions to her that I'm 34 or 35 days smoke free...

She looks st me and says oh wow, but it was really hard to do right?

And winked,  I looked back and said no actually, not going to lie, it was actually really easy, I Read a book and I was done...

I tell you, that confused look on her face was priceless, but I know that same look, it's a look of wonder... she asked what book etc, same one my buddy had used when he quit 5 years ago.

Just all in all was a really good feeling, and I hope she at least reads the book, what's the worst that could happen

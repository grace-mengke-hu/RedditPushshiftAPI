Feeling like a million bucks!

Today is Day 17 and I am feeling on top of the world! My anxiety and panic attacks have disappeared, my stress levels have decreased dramatically and I’m no longer hiding from things...I’m confronting my issues head on and it feels amazing!! Before, I would smoke and wish my worries away and continue to brush things under the rug and hope that one day they’ll just go away. Ever since I got rid of that crutch, my severe tendency to procrastinate flew right out the window!! I’m loving life smoke-free!!

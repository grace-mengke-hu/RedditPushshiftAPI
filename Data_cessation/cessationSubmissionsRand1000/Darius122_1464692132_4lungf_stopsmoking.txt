I've ran out of happines of being a non-smoker

At first i felt wonderful that i made througt the whole month after 4 yrs of smoking  , now its just a an ordinary feeling. I know that i will not get back to cigs , but i dont feel motivated as i was earlier.. i cant imagine what it will be like after a year, if i feel depresed right now..

Not a Success Story. Have been trying to quit for the past one year.

For the past one year I have lurking/occasionally posting on this sub. You guys are great and congratulations to everyone who has quit successfully. 

I on the other hand have gone to bed every single day for the past one year thinking I won't smoke tomorrow but have failed every single time. The max that I have gone without smoking was 4 days and that was only once. It's frustrating as hell because I cannot find the reason to why I cannot stop although I have many false reasons to continue. During quit withdrawal times those reasons seem very real even though I know they are not. It's just plain stupid on my part that I continue servicing my addiction.

Dreading my plans this weekend

Going to a bachelor party tomorrow - which will be on my third day since quitting tobacco and marijuana. 

I'm really dreading it on a number of levels - there will be booze (which I love to mix with cigs and weed), there will be smokers of both substances, and I will be reeling from the dual-withdrawals. It seems selfish for me to bail on my buddy's bachelor party though.. I'm a groomsman in his wedding, and I RSVPd to this event quite a while ago. Really though, I'd rather just be at home avoiding any potential trigger.. 

I suppose I will just have to deal with it... any advice for staying strong during the early stages while out in public? Or should I just develop a sudden case of "the flu"?

Hope everyone else is doing well and kicking tobacco in the nutsack!

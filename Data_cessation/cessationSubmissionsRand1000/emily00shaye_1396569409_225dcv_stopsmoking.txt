About to start the journey.

I have been smoke for at least 5 years. I have tried to quit in the passed probably 5 times and each time i gave in and found myself smoking more cigarettes a day then i did before i tried to quit. I have less the half a pack left and after i pull the last cigarette out of the box i am determined to make it the last one i smoke. Im scared. Iv tried this many times before and i really wanna kick the nasty habit. 

I have found myself doing school work, daily chores, just taking my dogs outside to use the bathroom, or just doing nothing makes me get the urge to light up.

I used to jump horses and it is physically demanding sport. I moved states away from my home town after my parents divorced and my mom was a drunk. (I lived with her because my dad pretty much took off). She was a pack to two packs a day smoker along with most of my family. I pick up my first cigarette at the age of 14 and i still smoke at the age of 17 almost 18 as of right now. I tried to ride horses while in the early stages of smoking and i still had the lung capacity to continue to ride. I stopped riding horses for about 2 years because my mom stopped taking me, until i really wanted to ride again. I couldn't ride like i did and it really put a strain on lungs working them so hard. My mom has now stopped drinking but continues to smoke. This is where im stuck. If i get a withdrawal i feel like ill just get one from my mom. 

I stopped riding for good because of smoking.

I regret it. I was born to be on a horses back. I really want to ride again and have a career doing what i love to do.

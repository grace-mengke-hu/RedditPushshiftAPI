Fighting of cravings

So after the last two comparatively easy days today is a difficult one.The weather has been amazing today and nice weather is always a trigger.Since last night it has been raining and I have been craving a smoke.It has been more than 12 hours now and I have craves that come after every few minutes.It's like I am having a mental withdrawal.  The other day someone told me that I am more hooked on the idea of smoking and I wholly agree to it.Since it has been four days my junkie thoughts are telling me one won't hurt and I can go back to be a non-smoker.I know there is no such thing as one so I have been fighting down the craves.I went to the shop from where I buy cigarettes and got myself an ice-creme instead.I am still bugged by the thoughts to smoke one so I am posting about it as previously it had helped me a lot.Hoping tomorrow is a better day.

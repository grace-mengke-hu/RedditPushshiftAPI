100

(ignore flair - day 101 starts at 6pm today)

I've had my ups and downs, weak moments and close calls, but I haven't touched a cigarette in 100 days.

It seems strange to think I really smoked for all of those years. I'm finally starting to feel "normal." I was at the bar the other day and someone was lighting up a smoke. Part of me wanted one, but it was such a tiny voice that I didn't even have to try to silence.

For those of you just starting out, it **definitely** gets easier, and it's so worth it!

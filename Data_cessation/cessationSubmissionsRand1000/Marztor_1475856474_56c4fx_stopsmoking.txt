It was all the little nudges that made up my mind to quit

I've smoked for nearly 20 years. I've quit a few times for short periods but have always gone back to it. This time I'm more determined.
It wasn't one thing that made up my mind to quit and I didn't rush into it.

The final nudge was a passing comment about stoptober from a person I have immense respect for.

Ten minutes later I'd ordered an e-cig and downloaded the Smoke Free app and set my quit date for the following Monday. 

4 and a bit days in I'm still feeling positive and although I'm having"wobbles"  I haven't succumbed yet. 

I have a feeling this weekend is going to be struggle but I will succeed

Day 18

Day 18 and my chest infection is disappearing, yet I'm still spitting up lung butter, my lungs must be so clogged its gross. My vision is a lot clearer too I have noticed, that hazing eye sight I had before I quit is gone, the dizziness has gone too, and my short breath has gone. I won't smoke tonight or tomorrow or the next day. Bye bye poison!

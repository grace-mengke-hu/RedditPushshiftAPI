Constant cravings... When they let up for a moment, it's wonderful.

I quit once for three years, and after a bad night in the hospital combined with a nasty fight with my ex, I picked up the cigarettes again- and I really had to work to get addicted to them again. Ugh. Stupid me.  
  
My birthday was last week- I just turned 29, and I'm trying to quit again. I listened to Allen Carr twice, and I thought I was ready, but since I put the cigs down my brain is CONSTANTLY in withdrawal. I've only seen calm twice, and for two minutes each time, since my last cigarette. I can't focus on ANYTHING. It's driving me crazy.  
   
Physical symptoms are mild to non-existent. Just a constant small headache (thinking this is psychological) and coughing.  
  
What do I do? Am I not ready to quit, did the book not work this time? Or is that just the little nicotine monster trying to undo everything? I literally can't escape the cravings, please help!

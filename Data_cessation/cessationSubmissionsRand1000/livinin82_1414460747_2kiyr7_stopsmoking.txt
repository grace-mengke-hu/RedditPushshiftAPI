Tomorrow makes 6 months!!

I started smoking when I was 14.  
  
I'm about to turn 27, and when I realized I had been smoking for over 12 years I was devastated.  
  
I have triplet brothers that all gave me dirty looks when I would smoke, all my life. They told me they hated it, as well as other people that truly cared.   
  
I went to Counterpoint Music Festival in April of this year. I knew I would be taking my brothers to Bonnaroo Music Festival in June and I do my fair share of "recreational enhancers". I decided Counterpoint would be my last time smoking, because I simply didn't want my brothers to make that face every five minutes when I wanna smoke cause I'm some kind of high on something. So at Counterpoint I smoked an obscene amount of cigarettes. Like so many that I felt tar caked on my teeth in the front and back. I remember that last cigarette I had, and how awful it tasted, and how done I officially felt. It may be one of my most vivid memories.  
  
Over time I ended up going to 7 festivals this year...doing many drugs, and having every opportunity to smoke a cigarette, being a weed smoker and someone who drinks, and especially one who smokes after sex. It is safe to say after being tested, having them in my hand (holding them for someone else), having them offered to me, and seeing packs lying around the house, I am officially done with smoking. You can be, too!! I subscribed to this sub when I was not so serious about quitting. I have lurked, and waited for the perfect moment to make myself known. I can honestly say you have all inspired me, and I am here now to inspire you!! Thank you all so much!!  
  
  
Bonus points: I quit on my mom's birthday!!

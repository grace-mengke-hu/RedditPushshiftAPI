6 months clean

Started this process 9th of jaunary. 6 months clean now. Looking back, I remember imagining this process would become a real nightmare. But know this: it only takes commitment and force of will. Some will think you won't be able to make it, you will even believe them sometimes, but reality is cravings and bad mood and anxiety and this stressful need to smoke will disappear sooner than you expect them to. Just don't give up and give yourself the chance, because you will feel as rewarded as your body will be.

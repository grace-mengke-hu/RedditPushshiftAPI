Women Quitters - help/advice needed

Ladies. I'm coming up on my first period after quitting. I'm curious your experiences and trying to gauge expectations. Normally, my PMS symptoms are beastly, I want to kill everyone but I want a hug like nothing else. I crave salty, carby foods, and sugar. Pure sugar. Cramps, minor bloating. I smoke more and move less (lethargic). 

The last few days of quit have been hell. I hate everything. I am battling my brain from 4 PM until I go to bed. I cannot imagine surviving this getting worse. 

Question is this: were your first period symptoms stronger or easier after quit? (Jesus, please say easier, but also be honest, if I need to mentally prepare for worse, I need to know)

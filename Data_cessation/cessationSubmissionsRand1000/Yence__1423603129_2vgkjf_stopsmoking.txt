Suddenly a lot harder again

So I've quit for about 35 days now but suddenly the urge to smoke has become a lot worse again. I could think of reasons why this is happening (depression, boredom) but I can still rationalize these away (I was just as depressed and bored before i quit smoking, only back then I was also unhappy about the fact that I was a smoke so it was probably even worse).

I live in a 100 year old house that has been converted to appartments but when one of my neighbours starts smoking in his appartment (which he is allowed to do), I can smell it. Apparently it gradually seeps in through his ceiling and through utility shafts. I only noticed this after I quit smoking. So it often reminds me of smoking when I'm home.

I also gained a bit of weight - at the moment this is not a big deal but I will not accept gaining more so I should adjust my eating pattern or go outside and actually move more often. But I don't want to do that, sigh. It's probably just the depression that makes all this seem like too much of an effort to deal with, I don't know... But I just start wondering wether I care enough...

Probably somebody needs to put my thought pattern back on the rails. I've been doing fairly well, I haven't quit for so long ever since I started smoking (fourth attempt).

Some things like partying, drinking coffee,... no longer remind me to smoke. The cravings still happen quite often though (about 5 times a day) especially in the evenings after a meal or while drinking.

I've been waiting for weeks for the regular cravings to go away but I'm still struggling everyday (however the craving goes away after 5 minutes max.). But smoking too was also a struggle for me. It feels like smoking or not smoking, it sucks either way...

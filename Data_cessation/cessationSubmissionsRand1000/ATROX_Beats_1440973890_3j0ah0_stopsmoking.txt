I feel pretty incredible.

So I'm at the end of my fourth day smoke free, and I feel like the proverbial "3 day hump" you always hear about is actually true. Yesterday, I felt like the withdrawal was too much to handle at some points, like I was gonna cave any minute. Today was totally different. I woke up feeling great, and I made it through the entire day with only a few minor cravings. I feel like I'm through the worst of it and everything from here on out will be a cakewalk in comparison. I'm excited to finally distance myself from this addiction and get on with my life. I'm ready to get healthier and be happier. 

This sub is awesome, by the way. I found it a few days ago and it gave me the confidence to quit cold turkey. You guys have been a really great support structure (I don't really have one IRL), and I can't thank you all enough. Here's to the upcoming weeks, months, and years of smoke-free living. :)

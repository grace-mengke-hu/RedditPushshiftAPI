Quitting tomorrow. Cold turkey. Hubby is not... tips?

Yeah, so I have been getting tired of cigs. I hate the feeling of being a slave to any drug, and it sucks that I have to plan around this shit. And for someone who fucking hates the sound of coughing, I am surely not doing enough to percent COPD. Also it's expensive lol. 


I figure tomorrow will be a great day for it. Hubby and I are donating plasma tomorrow, and I can't smoke before we go because it makes my pulse too high, and I can't smoke for at least 5 or 6 hours after because I will pass out. We will be there for 6 hours, so I am already looking at around 18hrs without a cig if you count all the time I will be sleeping ha. So I figured I would just extend that! 


Issue is: hubby isn't ready to quit just yet. I understand that, but it's gonna be hard. Y'all got any tips on quitting when the person you live with isn't? I am thinking about getting myself some suckers, and will definitely be taking a lot of naps. Anything else particularly helpful?

Trouble breathing after 10 days of quitting smoking

It was all going well, but from yesterday I am having trouble breathing. Initially it was tight chested, but now I am having trouble breathing. 10 days since i've quit. Is this normal? Or do I have to get xrays and stuff? I know most people would say go to doctor to be safe, but I just want to know if its normal. It's not continuous out of breath, but few times, but I am worried if its something big. I woke up in the middle of the night and now I am having trouble breathing.

Edit: No cough. I've never coughed while smoking too. I've smoked for 11 years and quit some 10 days ago. I am 34 now.

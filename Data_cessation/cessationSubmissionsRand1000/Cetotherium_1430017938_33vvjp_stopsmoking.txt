Giving cold turkey another shot, worried about work.

I've come to realize that patches or gum aren't going to be effective, so I've decided to try to cold turkey it again. I know it generally takes 3 days for the withdrawals to go away, and I'm worried about that 3rd day at work on Monday, worried that I won't be able to focus or will lose my temper with one of my co-workers or my boss. 


How did others out there deal with the stress of quitting at work? What should I do if I find myself losing my cool?

My body has been weird since I quit.. Please help if you can..

I quit smoking two weeks ago, still had the remnants of flu in my system so I'm not sure what I was coughing up for the first 3 mornings, it stopped for a few days and now it's back with a blocked nose and a itchy throat as a bonus prize. Please let me know if this is natural, I've never quit for more than a day and I've been smoking for 7 years.

Starting again.

I've been a stop-and-start quitter for most of the last month. I forgive myself for messing up (had a major stress thing happen and I caved) but am tired of the back and forth. And of my circulation sucking.  
  
I've made myself reset my badge every time I've messed up, and I'm hoping that the annoyance of doing this multiple times will have taught my brain to just wise up and be done already.  
  
So here I go again. If anyone has any advice for a stop-and-start quitter in terms of how to really reach escape velocity on this thing, it'd be much appreciated. (Otherwise, I'll just do what I gotta do: not smoke!)  
  
Mainly just posting here again for accountability, though. Thanks everyone and good luck!

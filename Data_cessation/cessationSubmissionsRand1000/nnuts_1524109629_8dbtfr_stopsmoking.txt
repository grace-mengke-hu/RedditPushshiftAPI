I don't know when I last had a cigarette

So, I quit last fall, using a vape, but I didn't totally stop - I'd bum a smoke every once in awhile when drinking.  I just realized today that I don't remember the last time I did that.  It's been at least a month, I'm sure.  How much longer?  I haven't a clue.

I don't know if I'd have believed that to be possible this time last year.  Keep with it, guys, it's totally doable!!

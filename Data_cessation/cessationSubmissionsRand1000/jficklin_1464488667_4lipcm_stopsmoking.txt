Family smoking around me

So I'm home for the holiday weekend. My mom has been a smoker for years on and off. We used to smoke all the time when I came back here to visit. 

I called early this week and explained that I'm quitting. She said she wouldn't smoke around me. Less than 10 hours in though she has had a few. I know I can't be angry at her or expect her to quit because I am, but it's driving me crazy. This coupled with a bunch of recent stress and I feel like in going to crack and have one.

Can I get some support here? Anything would help. Thanks gang.

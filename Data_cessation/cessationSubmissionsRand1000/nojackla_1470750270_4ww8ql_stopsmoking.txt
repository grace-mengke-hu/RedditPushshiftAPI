Made it a year! You can too!

You can do it too. I don't have any special reserves that you don't have. I'm smart but not super-smart. I'm not athletic but I'm not a couch-potato. I've had some really bad things happen to me and some really great things happen. 

I'm just a regular guy like you and I've been where you've been. I've been at that place where you wake up coughing and you know, KNOW that the smoking is killing you. You're getting dressed at 1am because you have to run to the convenience store so that you'll have cigarettes in the morning and you hate yourself for having to do it. You have to duck out during get togethers because you've got to smoke. You can concentrate during meetings or movies because you're thinking about cigarettes.

But I stopped and you can too. And it's hard sometimes in the beginning but it gets easier and easier until you really don't think about it too much. And as hard as it is, it's not as hard as hating yourself and hating what smoking is doing to you.

You can do it guys. I believe in you!

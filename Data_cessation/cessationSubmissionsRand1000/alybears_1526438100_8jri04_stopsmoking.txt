Phlegm in throat with vape?

Hey, everyone. I’m on day 4 of my quit and I have been using a low nicotine vape as a bit of a crutch to help with me getting through this. (2 pack a day smoker) 
I’m sure most of you have experienced the coughing and hacking up of mucus and all sorts of goodness from your chest throughout your time smoking.
I’m still experiencing this lightly and I’m curious if I should blame the vape or is this just residual effects from my smoking as I’ve only been off the cigs for 4 days.

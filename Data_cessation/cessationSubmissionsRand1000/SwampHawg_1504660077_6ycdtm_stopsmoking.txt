Day 6, so I'm thru the barbed wire.

The cumulative toll of beating down every craving over last 6 days (and Nights!) is fatiguing.  

One thing you don't learn til you quit smoking is how your brain has diff parts.  The craving first hits the lizard part of the brain, which then transmits what seems like good news, it has a craving that it knows can be satisfied to good pleasure.  It takes like half a second for your frontal lobe to catch up to what's going on, identify it as a nicotine urge that we are now done satisfying, and put its foot down like the adult in the room.

And my frontal lobe is real sick of this toddler.

Ace up the sleeve though, focus on that newly oxygenated bloodstream and get some exercise, be your own best friend.

Wherever you are, cheers and good luck.

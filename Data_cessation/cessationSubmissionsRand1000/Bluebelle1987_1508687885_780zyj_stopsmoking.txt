34 hours smoke free

I feel kind of like my brain is squishing itself,  but also my cough has cleared up a lot on its own. When I do a deep breath, at the bottom exhale, itâ€™s very grainy and gravelly. I am trying to do this deep breathing more often to try to clear my lungs faster. Just the idea of all the tar and disgusting filth stuck in them, especially on my exhales, grossed me out.

But I still have that urge to have that euphoric light headed dizzy feeling.

Thatâ€™s just my brain.

Another thing that has helped? Completely stopping smoking in any vehicle for the past week before quitting. Makes my car smell better and Keeps me more accountable, as driving is a huge trigger for me.

Also downloaded easy way for women as an audio book and have been listening to it basically non stop. Will likely listen to it again. Highly recommend the audio books if you need to do a lot of driving.

Anyway, thatâ€™s where Iâ€™m at.

I am anticipating horking up a bunch of black tar and stuff. When does that generally happen? Anyone have any luck with homeopathic expectorants? Or any other expectorant to help with this process? 

Thanks all. Feels really good to know that I can talk to you all, knowing that you all know exactly what Iâ€™m going through too. ðŸ’• grateful for this community!

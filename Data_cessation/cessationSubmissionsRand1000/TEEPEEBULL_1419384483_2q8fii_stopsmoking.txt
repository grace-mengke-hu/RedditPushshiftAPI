Quitting does not cause withdrawl

Smoking causes withdrawl. 

When you are an active smoker, (performing the regular nicotine maintanence) you are constantly going through through cycles of withdrawl and the replenishment. Over and over again.

If you are a smoker, you are a nicotine addict.

Remember this:

If you don't feed it, you don't need it !
Break the cycle and you can beat it !!

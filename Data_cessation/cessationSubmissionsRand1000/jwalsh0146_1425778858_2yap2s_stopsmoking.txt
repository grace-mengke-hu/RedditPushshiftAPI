Almost 7 days but big cravings

Idk why I'm craving I've been using NRT, but it's not working. I'm using about 2 pieces of gum a day and a few puffs of a blu cigarette here and there. I've also been running all week and lifting (I've always done that though). I also think I've gain 15 lbs in the last month. I've quit twice this month, obviously not successfully. I take bendryl to sleep the last week, puts me out cold ,good for the insomnia. 

This might just be an attention whore post but I'm hurting.

Edit:
I appreciate your responses guys.helped me make it out of last night w/o a mishap

When will my lungs feel better?

I quit smoking cold turkey about 14 days ago. Currently I'm 24 and have been smoking since the age of 16. It seems like my lungs are in more pain than they were when I was smoking. I actually have more of that shortness of breath feeling (or at least I notice it more). Oddly enough, this makes me want a cigarette because part of me feels like it will smooth this feeling. Any ideas?

Chain reaction of goodness from quitting

I don't think I'm the only person this has happened to but... for those of you who are still smoking and wish you were a non-smoker who was eating healthy and exercising... there is hope. When you quit smoking a chain reaction of positive outcomes flows from that.

I quit 165 days ago. Around day 120 I decided that since I beat the nicotine monster my next goal to focus on (since I rarely thought about smoking at that point) was to lose my gut. So I quit drinking alcohol (I'd replaced nicotine with alcohol and was having 4-5 drinks a night) because it is empty calories and just not good for you in general. And then I realize I eat like crap (eating tons of fried food and huge portions) which would make it super hard to lose weight. So now I eat super healthy (salad, carrots, apples, oranges, eggs) for every meal. And then I got the motivation to work out to quicken the weight loss. Keep in mind I haven't worked out since high school and I'm 33. So I bought a $50 exercise bike off Craigslist and have been biking at night and taking the stairs at work. They call it the Sweatflix diet, exercise while watching Netflix shows haha. So far I've lost 10 pounds in a month!

Thought I would share. I've wanted to be where I am now for the past ten years and it is surreal to be here. Hope you guys have a positive experience quitting like I did.

Been a week. Urges have reduced.

So I noticed I had urges to smoke particularly when I was bored. My body didn't really want it but I was just so used to doing something when not much was going on. Initially I thought I'd do a couple of push ups every time I had an urge to smoke. That didn't turn out as expected because I'm a lazy piece of shit. So instead I've kept sliced cucumber (Sprinkled with salt, mango powder, and paprika) in the fridge. It's a pretty cool (Quite literally) way overcome a craving. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3I0mJ2RfU0) video works as motivation whenever I feel like smoking. That's it for now. Just wanted to say hi to all of you! Cheers! :)

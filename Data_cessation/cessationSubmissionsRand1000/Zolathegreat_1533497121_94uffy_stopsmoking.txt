Joel Spitzer videos are not monetized!!!

I was angry at some people on this subreddit for reporting my good will to share an information about Joel Spitzer. He doesn't even take donations. He is a professional with 40+ years of experience. I wanted to share how he helped me. But for some reasons, people here reported that. But, that's a mistake. How can I regain his honor? He is amazing human being. He deserves it.

so can I quit if I just run out of smokes today?

what's stopping me? I guess my day will suck. Or will it be amazing because I'm quitting smoking?

i've been at it for 14 years now -_-

MY LIFE IS AT ITS WORST POINT IN HALF A DECADE I NEED TO DO SOMETHIN DIFFERENT. Smoking isnt my biggest problem right now but it really IS MY BIGGEST PROBLEM :[

How did you quit? Cold turkey, gum, patches, e cig? I have all at my disposal I’m just curious what everyone’s experiences are!

I think cold turkey is probably the easiest in the long run, I’ve been reading Allen Carr’s book which makes me question myself every time I smoke, so that is helpful. I’ve also been more mindful of how my body feels and I am aware it doesn’t want cigarettes. I’m just wondering how you became a non-smoker, and if you used medication or an e-cig, are you still using them?

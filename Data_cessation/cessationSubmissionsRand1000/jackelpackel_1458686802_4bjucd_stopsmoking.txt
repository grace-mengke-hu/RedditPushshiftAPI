Quitting for the thousand time

I've been smoking since I was 14 years old. I still remember that day like it was yesterday. 16 years later here I am worse than ever. I'm chain-smoking 1-2 packs a day. My drug habit is what made me chain-smoke worse. Last week around Thursday. I developed smokers cough. I just wouldn't stop coughing every 3-5 minutes and mucus was really thick when I did.

Now since I quit (again) yesterday. My coughing as improved a lot. I cough now every once and awhile. No more mucus coughing. I'm also doing this cold turkey. No nicotine gum or patches. I know that if I can do this without patches. I can do anything.

I am struggling with my mind trying to justify smoking. You should hear the reasons and excuses. I'm trying to stay strong and resist. It's going to be hard, but the end-result will be worth it.

Only thing is how to live with someone that is smoking and doesn't want to quit

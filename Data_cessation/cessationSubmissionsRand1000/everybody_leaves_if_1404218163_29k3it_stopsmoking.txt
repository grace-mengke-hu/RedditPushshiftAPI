Day Five and HURTING

Oh my god, day 5 SUCKS. Woke up today with my whole head in pain, as if I am dehydrated or missing caffeine or something. Actually it feels like somebody hit me in the face with a metal girder, right across the jaw. My stomach hurts and I feel bloated and gross. The pain in my head is so bad I can't concentrate. This is what I get for being a dummy and inviting nicotine into my system to set up shop and push me around for years on end.

Well you'd think me saying how bad this is - and really, feeling AWFUL right about now - would make me want to smoke. well FAT CHANCE! Now that I am properly educated about the fact that smoking only seemed to brighten my day.... it was an illusion. I felt like crap (and am feeling terrible right now) BECAUSE i smoked. As bad as this is to endure, I know it is the addiction thrashing around in its death throes, and one day it will never bother me again.

EDIT: Then I learn with horror that the reddit badge counts days successfully smoke free, not which day you are on currently, so it's not day five at all! D: Just kidding, the numbers mean nothing to me, only my health and happiness.

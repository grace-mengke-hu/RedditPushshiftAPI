Cigarettes killed my great aunt and uncle

They died at a young age, 42 and 44 to be precise, both of lung cancer. I was very close to them, as they raised my mom after their brother (my mom's father) drowned when she was 7. They were also there for us when my dad walked out on us; I was just a 2 year old toddler. They never had children, so I was the closest thing to a child they had. My aunt went first, then three years later it was my uncle who passed away. I grew up watching them smoke half a pack a day. The smell of cigarettes was comforting to me, and when I turned 18 and smoked my first Newport, it was love at first breath. Today I'm 21, and I am addicted. I've noticed my lungs decline over the years and I often struggle to take a full breath. It's almost like they're tired of being poisoned. Yesterday was the anniversary of my aunt's death. It was also the first day in 3 years that I didn't smoke. I'm going to beat this addiction for them. I'm going to beat it for myself. I refuse to leave this world in twenty years. I have too much to do. Wish me good luck; I'll need it.

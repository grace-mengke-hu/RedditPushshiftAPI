I was here before. Didn't smoke for about month and then returned to smoking... Quitting again.

As a title says. I want to do it. I know how awesome I was feeling when not smoking even couple of days in a row. I am fit person, I workout a lot. Not smoking would help me a lot with exercising, meeting new people(new GF perhaps), my money problems and ofc overall mind and physical comfort.

I stoped yesterday after 4 pm. Today I'm going to cut my lovely beard(not that big one, but I look better with it). What for? To show myself that I'm staring new life today. I want my beard to indicate how long I'm not smoking. I think I will add some pictures of my shaved face later.

Day one is OK, no big need for cigarette, except that I think about it once every 10 minutes.

Thanks for reading. Maybe I will write comments here to motivate myself - like a diary. I don't know yet.

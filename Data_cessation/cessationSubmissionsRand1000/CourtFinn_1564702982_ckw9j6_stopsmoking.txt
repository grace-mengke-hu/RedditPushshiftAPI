Chantix vs Champix commercials

Just curious the Chantix commercial here in the states has a turkey as in cold turkey but it’s actually warm turkey because that’s how you are supposed to use it, slowly cut down, is the Champix commercials similar? Just wondering 🤔BTW used Chantix for a month and a half and loved it! 3 months 🚭🙌👱‍♀️

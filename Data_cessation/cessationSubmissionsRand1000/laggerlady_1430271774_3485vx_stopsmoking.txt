It has been awhile

It has been over 2 months since I stopped smoking and I just want to let the awesome people of this subreddit know how important they have been in my quit. I am 57 years old and I have smoked for over 40 years! That is scarey. What is even more scarey is that I am an insulator and have spent my life working with asbestos. It is a known fact that anyone who works with asbestos and smokes has a 50 percent bigger chance of developing cancer than a non smoker, and I still smoked.  I lost the vision in my one eye due to macular degeneration which is made worse by smoking and I still smoked. I knew that I was killing myself and doing damage and I still smoked! I understand how easy it is to make excuses and say why we love to smoke - I have done them all. Trust me, none of those excuses are real, they are all the addiction beast playing with your mind. I feel so much better since I quit, I ran 6 kim today at the gym - me! an old lady ex smoker! You can all do it too. Talk to all the great people who are hanging around here who have done it. Don't get upset when we tell you that your addiction is giving you bullshit excuses, cause it will! Know that it gets better, it just takes time. You owe it to yourself, give your body the chance to get over the addiction! Don't let that horrible little fucker win, you deserve better! Thanks especially to Jonesy who was there for me and helped me through some tough times, I hope I can be as helpful to others. I am a non-smoker!!!!!!

72 day and I’m ready to deal with everything else now

I’m ready to handle the things I said I’ll do it when I quit smoking... well I’ve started running. Ive packed on the weight during my early quit and now I’m running!! It’s insane to me. 

What are you doing now that you waited until you quit to do?

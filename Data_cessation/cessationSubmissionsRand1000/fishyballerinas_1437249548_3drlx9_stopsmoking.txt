Just a check in!

Hey! To all you new to quitting, just know you can do it. One minute, hour, day, month, etc... I'm amazed at the progress and I'm racing my bike and love it. 

Some advice:
1. Always delay going and smoking if you get the urge. Just 5 minutes can make the difference.
2. Find an activity that make smoking look stupid. Mine was biking and it has helped so much.
3. Ask family and friends for help. 
4. You don't need it. You never have.
5. Remember, it is hard to do. Don't let anyone tell you it isn't hard, but you can do it. That is the one thing I don't agree with Allen Carr, fuck that shit... IT WAS FUCKING HARD TO DO. Sometimes, it was incredibly simple as well. You have to take the good with the bad. 
6. Don't be so damn hard on yourself. When you start to self doubt, distract your brain with cat pictures, podcasts, porn, whatever to stop the negative thoughts for a while. 

You can do this!

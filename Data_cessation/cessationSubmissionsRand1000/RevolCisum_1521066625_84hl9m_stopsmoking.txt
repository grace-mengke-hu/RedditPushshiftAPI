Having a nicotine lozenge

I know I'm giving in to the addiction, but this is better than smoking I guess.  I was really struggling, and seems I struggle a lot at work.  So, I will try to not use too much nrt, just enough to get me through, and get off it all again on days off.  I just cannot smoke again.  And trying to make it easier on myself.  :(

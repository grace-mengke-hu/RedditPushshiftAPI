Spent a few hours in a smoky house yesterday

It was awful. The house smelt, it was hard to breathe. I thought about asking my friends to open a window but it was absolutely freezing so didn't. I had to have a shower when I got home as I could smell it in my hair and today I have a sore throat. 

First time I've been to this friend's house since quitting, and it didn't trigger any cravings for me. Just reemphasised how shitty I used to be to my lungs. I'm sorry lungs!

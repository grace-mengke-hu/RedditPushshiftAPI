Anything I can do to rehabilitate my teeth?

I'm gonna keep this short, but I think I might not be the only one who is interested in this:
Does anyone have any experience with/knowledge of products or methods to help restore healthy (looking) teeth and gum after a decade of heavy smoking?

Happy new year everybody!

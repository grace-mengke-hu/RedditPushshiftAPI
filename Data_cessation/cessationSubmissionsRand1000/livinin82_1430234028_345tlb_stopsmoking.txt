Today officially makes one full year.

I can't begin to describe how good I feel. All of my friends have gone back to cigarettes, I am officially over it. The nightmares with me smoking in them are over. The ability to say no is organic, seeing or smelling them reminds me of a previous version of myself....and I don't wanna hang with that version.....girls that smoke are unattractive.

Smokers love to be stressed...they want to get to that point where everything is too much and they HAVE to go have a cigarette. Fuck that. Deal with your problems and don't resort to shitty tar sticks. Why would anyone wanna put a butt in their mouth anyway??? This isn't Human Centipede.

Happy day!!! You can do this. They're gross.

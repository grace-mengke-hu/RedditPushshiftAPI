Smoking & drinking

Hi!
First post in this subreddit. I started taking Zyban at the beginning of September & stopped smoking regularly September 11. BUT I haven't stopped when I drink. I've realised it comes down to the fact I don't (can't?) think about not having one after I've had a glass of wine or two. I don't buy any but my other half smokes & he's a softy so always caves when I ask him for one.
Any suggestions or tips to help me on those nights? It works out that I have 1 or 2 on one weekend night but I want to stop completely & then I can come off the Zyban.
Thanks for your help!

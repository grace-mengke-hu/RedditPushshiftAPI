Day 3: 24 yr smoker, cold turkey

Day 1 blew
Day 2 blew almost as hard 
Day 3 so far: I feel fantastic. Euphoric, even. Cravings steadily less, motivation to quit increasing. The things peoplle say abouy taste and smell are true. I have bad breath. I have probably always had bad breath while smoking, but now i really realize it. I smell things from across the room that i once had to be right next to. Im starting to believe that the things ive been hearing about how hard it is to quit smoking for decades now are false. It's not hard if you truly want it. Sorry if you feel differently but dig deep if you do and make your mind up. Man up. Feels easy. F smoking. Are my eye bags shrinking? I think they are. On day 3? I must be crazy. No, i was crazy to smoke 24 years.  I forgot what life was like without it, but i feel like many limitations have dissolved and i have more capacity for enjoying life.

Never again. To be continued.....

Day 4 - Feeling Dirty!

Day 4. Going a bit stir crazy. Don't want to actually smoke but feeling very aggressive and a bit unhinged. I just want to do SOMETHING but I don't know what.
My chest is also really starting to hurt, I feel like I'm dirty on the inside. It's gross. I wanna throw my lungs up and get a new pair. I'm such a moron for smoking for so long.

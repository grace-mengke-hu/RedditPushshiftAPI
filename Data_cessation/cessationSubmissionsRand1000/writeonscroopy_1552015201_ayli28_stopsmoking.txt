Don't be a dummy like me and smoke again after being quit for almost a month

I posted a couple days ago when I stupidly smoked a pack after being quit for about 27 days. I just finished Day 2 Smoke Free (again), and I feel like shit. My throat is sore and extremely dry, I have a headache, my body aches ... I could be getting sick for real, but honestly I think it's just "quitter's flu" rearing it's ugly head. The three weeks before that, I was feeling great, going to the gym every day, and losing weight. Now I just want to sit on the couch and stuff my face with junk to try to forget how shitty I feel. 

Just wanted to give some encouragement to folks to not be like me! If you've been quit for a few days, a few weeks, or even a few months, don't have one more puff! I bought a pack, had one cig, then just "had" to smoke the rest. It was so not worth it. 

I won't smoke with you today.

Day 2 for me, couple things that have helped

Just a few things that are keeping me from lighting up that I thought I would share

Pistachios have been a godsend. Satisfies the hand fidgets and oral fixation plus they're super healthy and delicious.

I googled pictures of smokers teeth which wasn't as soul curdling as googling images of meth teeth. Seriously, the next craving that hits just do a quick image search and scroll until the nic fit passes.

Lemons, lemonade, anything sour. I have these little packets of crystallized lemon that I used for a baking venture long past, but I just tear open a packet and dump it on my tongue. It's actually a double whammy bc the vit c is so important while going thru withdrawal and the sour makes you forget about the craving.

I've also been brushing my teeth like crazy and flossing. Helps. 

Hope these help yall and pls add if you have any other tips

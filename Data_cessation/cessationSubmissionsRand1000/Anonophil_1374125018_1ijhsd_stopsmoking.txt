So I missed my anniversary

Hi friends, I just realized that I'm at 398 days.  Please don't think I'm bragging, or that I'm trolling for up votes.  I'm not.  I actually intended to check in at a year and post the obligatory "yeah me!", but I didn't.  Somehow it passed me by.

Truly, I owe of all of you a heartfelt thanks.  I remember checking in at various times throughout my journey, explaining how I was feeling and each of my little challenges throughout.  Some of you commented, but I suspect most of you (like me) just took a mental note of some anonymous stranger on reddit who's passing yet another milestone.

I can't believe I'm where I am today.  Smoking is so not part of my life anymore.  But I still fear it.  I fear the addiction and what it did to my mind.  When I'm with smokers now I cringe, not because I'm judging them (I'm not!) but because I fear what would happen if I would "accidentally" take a drag, or perhaps I (irrationally?) fear what would happen if I breath a little too deeply the second hand smoke.  But really, end of the day, the challenge is so minor.  

I enjoy life more now than I even did.  Sure, I still have personal challenges, and I still look constantly for personal improvements.  But none have ever been as hard as quitting smoking.  

For those of you who are just starting with your journeys, keep it up.  Figure out how your mind works.  Read Allen Carr's book, or whatever you need to do to try to understand why you do what you do.  Smoking is an illusion.  Don't think it's something you will miss.  It's an *addiction*.  It's NOT enjoyable.  It never was, it never will be.  Your human mind is smarter than Pavlov's dogs'.  If you can beat this, well, I'm pretty sure you can do just about anything.  There is a light at the end of the tunnel.  It may seem a long way away, but like any journey once you're on it you'll eventually get to the end.  

Cheers

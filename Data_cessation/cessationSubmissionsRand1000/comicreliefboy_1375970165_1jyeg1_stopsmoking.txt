Anyone have some advice for a novice quitter?

Over the past year I noticed I've been smoking more and more. I'm up to 17 or 18 cigarettes a day, sometimes even a whole pack. I live in Pennsylvania and I smoke Camels, which at Wawa (any PA smokers know this is the place to buy them) are about $5.50. What's distressing to me is the fact that the money is becoming less and less of an object, so long as I have a new pack every day. I even bought a pack in New York for $9. The girl behind the counter said I should quit. I said she should mind her own business. See? I'm even becoming a prick over smoking. At this point in my smoking career I seriously cannot begin, take a break during, or end any activity without smoking. Like having one before, during, and after a movie. Every break at work, commuting to and from work, and the list goes on. 

Anyway, I want to quit. Badly. However the duality of my anxiety and addiction doesn't get my anywhere at all. I get terrified when I picture myself quitting for good. I know it's ridiculous, but I guess that's what addiction is. I leave them in my car on purpose and immediately turn around to get them. I hate it, I really fucking hate it. But I love it too! 

Shit!

Can someone provide some ACTUALLY effective baby steps, or mental techniques, or even words of wisdom?

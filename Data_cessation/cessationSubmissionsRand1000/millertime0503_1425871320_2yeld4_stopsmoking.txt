Third time's the charm.

I got the courage to quit for my first time ever after 12 years of nicotine addiction, in early February. I loved those two weeks of my life as a non-smoker. But I relapsed. I was depressed and stopped caring about anything. Despite that, I decided to quit again. I didn't have the same resolve. I knew that I needed to but my heart was not in it.

Those failures give me some fear. But I know that fear is one of the biggest reasons to smoke. I don't want to live my life in fear.

I know that life can suck sometimes, but smoking does not help with that. I'm sick of this shit. I want to be free, regardless of anything else.

I smoked my last cigarette tonight. It was disgusting. Good riddance. The badge reset and request is in -- and this time? The number will just keep growing.

Worst mistake

Well guys I fell off the wagon but I'm going to try again eventually but that's not why I'm here....
I'm here bc my biggest mistake wasn't starting up again but hiding it. I start up and was smoking again for about a week or two without my wife's knowledge but she did eventually find out. I was ashamed of starting up and I knew she wouldn't understand so I kept it from her. This hurt her a lot, she was more upset with me keeping this from her than she was about be picking up this bad habit again. 

All I have to say is if you do fall off the wagon don't hide it bc the fallout and guilt from that will be far worse than just telling them and dealing with their disappointment.

I know this sounds a bit disjointed, I'm just trying to get my thoughts out.

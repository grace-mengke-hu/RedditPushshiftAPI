Normally I would've bought a pack of cigarettes, instead I splurged at a coffee shop.

Yesterday on my way to class I walked into a coffee shop and got a delicious coffee drink and a giant piece of pumpkin bread. It was delicious, especially with my reforming tastebuds 

I was happy because 12 days ago I would've used that money to buy a pack of poison. 

So guys, REMEMBER!! There's a whole different life for anyone not smoking. Going to a coffee shop may seem small, but I haven't done it in months! 

You can do this guys. So can I. :)

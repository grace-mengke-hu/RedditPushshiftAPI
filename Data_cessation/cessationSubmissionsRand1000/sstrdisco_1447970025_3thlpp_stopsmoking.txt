Sense of taste & smell still changing!

Every once in a while, I get noticeable improvement for taste and smell. It had been a couple months since the last, but just this past week I had about three days of marked improvement. It's crazy the things I can smell now. Anyway, if you smoked for a long time and you're worried about these things, hang in there. It takes time for your body to heal, but changes will come.

Just a quick PSA: Cravings go away 100% completely.

It's been quite a while since I had my last cigarette by now (thanks to Mr. Carr), but I don't think I had even the slightest hint of cravings in the last year. I can sit in a smoky bar, getting hammered, people smoking around me, and there's nothing in me that wants a cigarette. Literally nothing. It's like I've never been a smoker in the first place. So guys - fear not, keep strong, and the most important tip of them all: There is no such thing as "just one cigarette". 

We're all gonna make it, brahs.

Exercise

Does anyone else have a newfound LOVE of exercising?  I feel that when you're a smoker you shrug off jogging or exercising as often as you'd subconsciously like to just because your lungs can't handle it.  I would go to the gym semi regularly when I did smoke, but since I quit, I'm at the gym 5 times a week.  I also jog on the treadmill at home or go out for jogs/runs 3-4 times a week.

I love it.

Tomorrow’s day 7- good night and wish me luck

Day 6 is wrapping up.  Had a tough couple of hours today due to some work stuff.  I fought through it and didn’t smoke.  Tomorrow i have to start my day w a 2 hour drive to deal w the work stuff that happened tonight.  I’m a little nervous because the car is my biggest trigger.  I’m a grocery distributor and would light up after each store I went to- didn’t matter if I was there for 10 minutes or two hours; or if the next store was across the street- I was smoking that cigarette.  I’m going to bring lots of snacks and water for the ride; and not let my employee frustrate me.  Wish me luck.  
As I typed this my 6 day badge alert popped up on my phone.  Made it through 6 days.  I Am a non-smoker.

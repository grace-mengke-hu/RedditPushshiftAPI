Smoking and anxiety?

I have been trying to quit all together for the past year or so but keep on relapsing. I'm currently reading Allen Carr's Easy Way to attempt to quit. Ive always had minor anxiety nothing to serious. But my mom passed a few months ago and my anxiety has sky rocketed and so has my smoking. I went from 10 a day maybe, to almost a pack to a pack and a half. What I'm asking from previous quitters that dealt with anxiety has it helped your anxiety a lot? How was your mindset after quitting?

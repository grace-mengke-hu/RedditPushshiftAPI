3.25 years.

Hard to believe it, but the math checks out.

It took a few tries. Wasn't always easy. But I am positive that anyone reading r/stopsmoking is reading it because they know it is time to quit and they want to quit. 

And reading all the success stories of people who smoked their last cigarette weeks, months or years ago is proof that you can quit.

Last week I deplaned after at 10 hour flight. The old me would have been completely berserk until I lit up and sucked in that hot smoke. But now I stroll outside with my luggage and see the puffers outside getting their fix and I feel liberated.

Keep it up, keep it rolling. It only gets better and easier as time goes on.

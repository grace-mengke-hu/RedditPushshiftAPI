A couple of tips I found on my own

It is SUCH a nice day today in North Texas, it is one of those days I can smell fresh air and my dog's farts in such exquisite technicolor, I used technique #2 almost instinctively. At one and half years, I feel I may be able to contribute these two tidbits:

1. The oral thing. This may seem weird but stay with me: when I first quit, I felt a tightening in the back of my mouth and top of throat, pretty much where the smoke hit. What I found helps is (do this when no one's looking) to open my mouth as wide as I possibly can - as if I was going to try to fit a baseball in it - and then stick out my tongue as far as possible, just pushing that muscle. Take a breath or two. I dunno why, but it helped.

2. Ten big breaths: feel a craving? Take ten deep breaths, first breath deep enough to make you sit up straight, and imagine - *visualize* - the (somewhat) pink tissue of your lungs expanding like the sponges they are, doing their job. Next breath and each subsequent breath, just go through the oh-so-very numerous reasons why quitting is a really really good idea and smoking is stupid. Enjoy oxygen! I rarely made it to breath #10 before the craving was gone.

Good luck everyone.

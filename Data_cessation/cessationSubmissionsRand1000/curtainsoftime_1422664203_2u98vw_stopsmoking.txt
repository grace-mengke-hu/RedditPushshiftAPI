My Problem with Alan Carr's Book

So, I spent the majority of today reading Alan Carr's Easyway to Stop Smoking in the hopes that it would help me quit. I was excited by the beginning of the book because it promised that I would be able to quit without any effort. Unfortunately, I continued to smoke afterward. My problem is when he says that smoking is not enjoyable. We just do it because we have an addiction. Once we realize it's not something precious we no longer feel like we're giving something up. But I actually enjoy smoking. I enjoy filling my lungs with smoke and I don't think cigarettes taste bad. And so I really do think I'm giving up something.
I admit I have only read about half the book today but I think I've got the basic gist of it. Nevertheless I still continue to smoke.

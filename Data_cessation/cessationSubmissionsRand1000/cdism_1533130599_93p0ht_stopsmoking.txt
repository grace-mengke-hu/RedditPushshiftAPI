Two Years!!!

I have never been more happy about not doing something! Two years today! I am nicotine-free! Started smoking at eight years old and I was a pack a day smoker since I was 12! Having vaped for two years, I tapered down my nicotine in the last year and found easier to stop in the final days. Simple, but not easy! If you are trying, keep going! It gets easier! Have a great day out there! Breathe easy!

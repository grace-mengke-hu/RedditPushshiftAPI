finally going to quit

I have no choice but to and I am stubborn as a mule. Today I only had 3 so far, a major difference from my usual half a pack to a pack. I'm trying to go 4 hours or more between each. Tomorrow I want to have no cigarettes. I know Cold turkey can be hard but this will be the 3rd time I've done it. The other 2 times it was because 1. I was underage and not able to buy them 2. I wasn't allowed to have money to get other buy them and 3. My parents found out and I want allowed to leave the house for a week.  This time will be harder. I was able to hold off for a few hours today because I mimicked the motions of smoking with a pen. The cravings are strong and I know they will be very strong for the next week. What can I do to help these cravings and urges? Currently as I type this, I won't lie  I am having one and I feel like shit for doing this, but I am enjoying one last one. I'm going to focus on the hours, like 9am tomorrow will be 12 hours then 9pm will be 24 and try to get through the next 72 hours.  Any advice at all will help and encouragement eill be greatly appreciated.

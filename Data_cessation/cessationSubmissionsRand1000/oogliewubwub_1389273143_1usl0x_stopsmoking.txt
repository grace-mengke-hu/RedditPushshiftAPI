I am really struggling today

Believe it or not, I'm on day 9 and struggling harder than I did on day 3. What gives? I don't GET IT.
I'm an absolute mess. My house is a mess, I don't want to interact with my kid. I burst into tears and lost my temper over the most ridiculous thing ever. 

I feel like I'm headed for the nut house. I honestly feel at this point that it might be worth it to just smoke so that I dont' harm myself or someone else.

What the HELL. Everyone said it would get EASIER, not HARDER.

Edit: Thanks those of you who were encouraging. I did make it through. I did not have any more meltdowns, I just kept myself firmly in hand. I do know it is the addiction talking, I was just baffled as to how bad it was yesterday.  This morning, on the other hand, I did not wake up craving a smoke and actually had coffee with breakfast with no urge to go outside to light up. Maybe I'm through the worst of it now. Maybe not. At any rate, I didn't smoke. So there.

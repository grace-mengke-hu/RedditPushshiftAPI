24 hours in, because I didn't leave my house today.

Wanted to quit for a while now, the longest I've gone is 4 months since I started smoking about 5-6 years ago. Cleaned the apartment today and found my ecig. Ran out of Blues last night. No announcing it to my husband who's seen me try and fail too many times, I don't want to disappoint him. Just, wish me luck on my way to work tomorrow, hopefully I don't stop anywhere.

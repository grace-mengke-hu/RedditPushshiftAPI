2nd week of Champix/Chantix, have cut right down without even noticing

And also way less depressed.

Is this a thing? A very welcome thing. 

I wasn't expecting it and hadn't read anything like that before but I'm feeling noticeably less depressed than usual in the last two days or so and I'm wondering if anyone had similar results. 

Also, how did the drug work for you? I'm still a bit anxious about quitting, more of security/habit thing but I noticed I went from about 30 cigarettes a day to about 5 without even trying or noticing. Is that how it works?

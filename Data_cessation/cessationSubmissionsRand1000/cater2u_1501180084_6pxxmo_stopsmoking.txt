How to stop thinking about smoking?

2 days in (caved SO had to restart). I'm at work and I can't stop thinking about smoking. I'm trying to justify smoking but then have to remind myself this is a DRUG ADDICTION that is nasty and gross. I really need to get work done but I'm so obsessed with smoking. How do I lessen these thoughts?

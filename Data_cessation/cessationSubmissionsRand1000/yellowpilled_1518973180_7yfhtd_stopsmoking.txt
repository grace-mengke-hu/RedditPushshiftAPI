100 days smoke free

*atleast in my time zone*

100 days as a non-smoker - life is great!
I don't have craving anymore and saved more than 480â‚¬ already.
I felt I could never get rid of them after smoking a pack a day but when I can do it, you can do it aswell!

Read Allen Carrs book and remind yourself why you wanted to quit in the first place!
Wish you all the best and I'm blessed to say I'm a non smoker now

I haven't smoked since Monday...

And I keep a cigarette on my tv stand, so I see it every day.  On one hand, it's like a constant temptation, since I can light it up at any time, but I mainly see it as a reminder that I *choose* not to smoke.  Does anyone else have any ways of dealing with their newfound freedom?

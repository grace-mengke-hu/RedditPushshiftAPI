8 days!!!!! NICOTINE FREE!!!

No patch, no vape, no smoke, no chew!!! No nothing! 

I have felt like a busy beaver chewing the hell out of toothpicks! ;) The habit still gets to me... I will be driving and reach for something that is not there. I will find myself in the kitchen and suddenly realize why I am there. BUT! Not today nicotine! Not today.

Thanks for reading! Hope you have a nicotine free day!

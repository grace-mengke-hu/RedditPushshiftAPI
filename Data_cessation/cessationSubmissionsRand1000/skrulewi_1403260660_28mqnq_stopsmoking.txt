80 days today. I've stopped craving cigarettes every day. It's down to about once every few days.

This is a hard thing to gauge because I don't NOTICE when I'm not craving. Whole days will pass where I will not even THINK about smoking once. It still comes, once every few days, usually visually. I'll see someone smoking out of their car, and I'll get triggered a bit, because I loved smoking in my cigarette chariot, blasting music ect ect bullshit bullshit.

Smelling cigarettes is another thing. I fucking hate it now. I used to love the smell. I'd step into people's smoking circles to inhale the smoke, anticipating my next smoke. No longer. Now it's awful.

I don't know exactly when this started to happen... sometime in the last month or so.

If you are in the first month, it gets better. The second month was still tough as well. The third month, I know in my guts that cigarettes won't cure my anxiety, they won't make me feel better, and most important, I'm not thinking about them constantly. I'm just getting on with life, and breathing deeper every day.

Thanks for everyone's support. Knowing this place is here, and my badge is here, and that you guys are here, has been a huge help. Here's to 3 months...

Trigger replacement ideas/help?

So, I'm in day 2 now.  Not too bad so far, but not great either.  Last night, I discovered one of my smoking triggers that I didn't realize was as strong as it was.  So, I like to play FIFA online.  It turns out that after each match (15-20 min apiece), I'd be a little tense, and therefore I'd go smoke to chill out before doing it again.

So, that's a HUGE trigger for me.  I need something to replace the smoke, without resorting to a giant bin of candy (and frankly, carrots are only so interesting).  Any ideas for something that easy to keep nearby that it's awful for me, but won't go bad (ie needs to be refrigerated, etc)?

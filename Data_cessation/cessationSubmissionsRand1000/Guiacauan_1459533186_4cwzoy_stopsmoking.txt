Ocasionally smoking.

Day 6 here, and it's very tranquil.


Like i repeated in other posts, i'm working out a lot, it's very helpful to keep stress at bay.

I'm waking up 2 hours earlier.
I'm getting pissed for things i didn't before. (I'm kind of using this to explode some things up that was bothering me for a long time at work and at home, very girlish i know, but when i bitch about something and i know i could use the fact that i stoped smoking as an excuse it's kind of awesome. Like a girl at PMS.)
I feel like my eyeballs are going to popout once in a a while.

But overall, i've made my decision, but:

Does anyone here ocasionally smoke a pipe ou a good cuban cigar? I have a felling that its my damn brain luring me back, but i feel very confident that i can enjoy a good cigar once in a while and still manage to not smoke cigarettes all day... does anyone here pull that off?

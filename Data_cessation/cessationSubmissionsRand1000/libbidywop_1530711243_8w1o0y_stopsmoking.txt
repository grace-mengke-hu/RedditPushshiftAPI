Day 2! I can't believe i made it!

Independence day indeed!! 34 hours and counting! Just had a good night's sleep surprisingly, and going to walk  my dog and not get short of breath, and go to the gym. Life is good

Also got a party later but I don't drink so if I'm super tempted I'll just drive home. I don't wanna screw this up.

Back... Again!

So I quit "for good" last year and made it maybe 2 months proper before lapsing back to drunken cigarettes and then hiding from my colleagues, before honestly smoking full time again.

I'm trying again having had an operation where my doctor informed me that if I need to have another operation, they won't because I'm a smoker and it won't heal. So I'm pretty shit-scared about that.

I can't remember how to stop eating my way through the cravings, and I can't exercise as a diversion at the moment because of my operation - help appreciated because I'm starting to crack.

Some of my concerns about quitting and why I am afraid to try to quit again.

I have been smoking about half a pack a day since I was 17.  I'll be 24 in one week.  I have tried to quit 3 times and eventually went back to smoking every time.  At this point I almost feel as though it's impossible for me to quit for the following reasons:

1.  Almost all of my best friends smoke.  I spend a lot of time with people who smoke and talk about smoking a lot.  I can't just stop being around these people.  

2.  I have an incredibly high stress life.  I go to law school, and work in a law firm that practices a very stressful area of law.  I never smoke when I'm at work but it's almost as though I spend all day looking forward to the cigarette I will have in my car on my way home.  It's only going to get more stressful.  I take the bar this year! 

3.  I enjoy drinking.  A lot.  I'm young and I like to go out with my friends and have a good time.  Any time I have tried to quit before, "drunk smoking" has been my downfall.  I can usually handle cravings until I start drinking.  

4.  I'm so afraid that quitting will result in weight gain.  

I am wondering if I should just wait until I am out of school to quit... 

I really want to quit because I feel so unhealthy.  I experience a smoker cough, shortness of breath, and I really hate smelling like smoke.  Additionally, I just generally hate the fact that something so small as a cigarette has such an impact on almost everything that I do.  I hate being judged for being a smoker.  

I guess what I'm looking for is help.... I honestly feel like I'm alone in this because none of my friends that smoke understand my desire to quit.

How I currently view smokers.

Hello,

This post is just a rant but it reflects the different way of viewing smoking from before to after I decided to quit. Before I decided to I viewed smoking as just another cool drug that some people choose to do. I'm very pro-drug and I did every drug I could get my hands on but only got really addicted to nicotine.

However now when I see someone smoking, be it a normal guy in the street or a badass in a show like mad men I think something more like : "What a loser who can't manage his addictions".

I know this might sound condescending because it is. But really smoking isn't at all fun. When I smoke weed I get high every time, when I take LSD I trip everytime. It could be fun a fun or a disasterous experience but it's an experience nontheless. But nicotine is literally the stupidest drug there is.

It's only fun the first time for the addict. It's fun for the people who manage it and only smoke it socially and occasionally but I forfeit that right when I got addicted. It's not fun for me and it's off the table now. For me it's just something I had to take to feel normal, like oxygen. You might enjoy a fresh breath of oxygen after holding your breath but breathing itself isn't enjoyable.

Fuck nicotine. 3 days into my quit and not one puff ever again no matter what. Well, except if I ever get "fuck you" rich but that's it.

Day 12 - Quitting Hookah

.... It's been so easy lately, I've almost forgotten I quit smoking. Until I get around the friends who still smoke hookahs like chimneys. Then you feel like the "lame" one, even if they're supportive. Your vape doesn't taste the same, you don't want to smoke too much weed. It's hard not to take a puff. 

So, I did. And just held the smoke in my mouth, not even a full drag. I couldn't! I spit it out and started coughing and laughing, telling them "I don't miss this at all."

They can have it. I don't need it, and now, I don't even want it. I wasn't ever sure I'd get to this point without nicotine, but I'm really happy I have. 

Day 12 and going strong.

Reset my badge after 460 days.

Met up with the roommate for some drinks. He smokes, as do a number of people I work with. Maybe just one cigarette? Yeah, let's see how it feels. Hmmm, that's not too bad. Oh, you're going to the store for smokes? Get me a pack of L&M's before we go see Mad Max.

Woke up with half a pack left this morning. Broke them into the trash, and now I'm coughing and trying not to get too discouraged.

On the plus side, Mad Max was awesome.

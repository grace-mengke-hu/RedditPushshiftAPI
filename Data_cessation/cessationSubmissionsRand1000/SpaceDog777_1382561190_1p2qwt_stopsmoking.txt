A good friend of mine died.

A good friend of mine died 4 days ago when a driver did a u-turn around a blind bend my friend drove around on his motorbike. His funeral is tomorrow and I'm not sure how I am going to make it through the day without cracking.

The only reason I havn't had a smoke yet is because I would tell him every time I saw him what day I was up to and we were planning a celebration for when I reached 100 days.

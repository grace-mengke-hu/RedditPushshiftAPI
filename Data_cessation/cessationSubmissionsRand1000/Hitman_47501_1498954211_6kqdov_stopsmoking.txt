This has been a crazy ride!

I have quit cold turkey one month ago after 15 years of addiction. Unlike the vast majority of quitters around here, i must say it was not easy for the first 20 days and not 7... I'm still depressive almost all the time, and I still carve for cigars even tough i haven't touched nicotine since I quit! Hope you have a better time quitting for me it was hell the last month

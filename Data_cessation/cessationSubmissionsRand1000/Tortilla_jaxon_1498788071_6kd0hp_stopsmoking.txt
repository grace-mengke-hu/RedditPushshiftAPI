Let's de-bunk nicotine's lies. I firmly believe that replacing lies with the truth enables us to live in freedom.

Here are some of the lies that I believed about smoking and nicotine use:

1. Smoking helps me concentrate.
Truth- feeding the craving just silences it for a short while thus the user immediately feels as though they can concentrate better. The reality is that the craving was demanding attention so you couldn't focus on anything other than feeding it. 
2. Smoking helps with stress
Truth- smoking creates stress. None of us are calm when we have a craving. We're tense and fidgety. Our nicotine levels have dropped since the last smoke and now our bodies are under stress to feed the next craving. Think about the last time you weren't able to feed the addiction for a long time. Were you calm? 
3. Smoking helps me cope with negative emotions or circumstances.
Truth- It's actually a way to avoid them. We wouldn't say that alcoholics deal with negative situations or emotions in a positive way, would we? Drug addiction = avoidance. 
 
These are just a few I thought of. What are yours?

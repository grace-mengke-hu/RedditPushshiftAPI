How much time is there in a day???

It's been 10 days with out smoking (cold turkey), and today I discovered that there's a shitload more time in the day than I thought there was before. I'd always felt rushed and unable to concentrate to get everything done. Today, I've smashed through everything I had to do and more and I feel amazing for it. 

I might actually discover that life is less chaotic as a non-smoker. Anyone else felt like this?

If smoking is mostly mental, and physical symptoms are imperceptible, then why don't herbal cigarettes work?

Smoking is 99% mental and physical addiction is practically imperceptible - this is one of the key principles of the EASYWAY method. Why don't herbal cigarettes work, then? Theoretically, if a person switched to herbal cigarettes overnight and was under the belief that they're the real thing - they wouldn't be able to tell a difference. They would believe that the cigarette is relieving stress and still get the desired effect, correct? I'm a little flustered with Allen Carr's method. I know that it works. I know that I'm supposed to quit. I get that it technically "gives me nothing". So why am I still smoking?

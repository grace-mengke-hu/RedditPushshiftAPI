Ok, this time I'm gonna try something different.

My most recent quit attempt was the best ever, 10 days, then on the 11th day I gave in when I was drunk and smoked.

I've been smoking lightly now for the past few days since, it's pissed me off so fucking much, I just want to quit for good for fuck sake. Never wanted to start in the beginning (got really drunk and someone offered me one) 

So this time I'm gonna try something new, I'm not even gonna smoke weed for the next few weeks either, as over here we roll with tobacco (you don't really have a choice, weed is harsh asf to smoke without tobacco)

I'm gonna get drunk, however, and I'm going to force myself not to smoke, to break that association, it's going to be difficult, very very difficult, that's how I broke my quit last time, I will have someone physically fucking restrain me if I have to though. Fuck fucking cigarettes.

My longest streak ever.

Since I started smoking in March 2014, the longest quit I have ever had was 14.5 days (involuntary: I was in a different country where my minor status did not allow me to purchase cigs). My second longest quit came with a bad illness, at 12.5 days. 

After this illness, I was required to get blood tests done for a couple of days to make sure everything was alright. My lowest point came when, one day, after I smoked and gave blood, I bought a whole fucking pizza and ate it, just so I could have a cigarette that would "feel good". I wasn't hungry, wasn't craving pizza, nothing. I wasted all my money just so I could have an "after-meal" cigarette while I was out of the house. After I ate the pizza, however, as I walked back home, I realised how pathetic that was, letting the addiction waste all my money, not just through cigarettes, but other things to enhance cigarettes. And that I really could not afford to go lower. So I stopped, right away. 

It has been 15 days since then! It feels wonderful, and a lot of this feeling is thanks to you guys. Bored all day with nothing to do, it's very easy to just have a cig now and then. But everytime I wanted one, I came here and it reaffirmed my certainty that cigarettes are useless and disgusting. Thank you all for the support, this is going to be an infinite streak!

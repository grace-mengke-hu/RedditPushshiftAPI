Quit smoking and haven’t smoked in 4 weeks and have terrible anxiety.

As the title states I haven’t smoked in 4 weeks and cravings are mostly gone but I honestly now feel anxious and depressed. This started to happen since week 2 of quitting and has been increasing over the weeks. I just feel terrible I have been working out which staves it off for a for an hour or two but it comes back. Any tips or advice how to handle this.

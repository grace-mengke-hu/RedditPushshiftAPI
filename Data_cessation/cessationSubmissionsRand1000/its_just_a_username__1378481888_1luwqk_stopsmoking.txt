I am a little bit annoyed by non smokers

It bugs me that my GF, some members of my family and some of my friends (all of them are non smokers) used to bitch so much about the fact that I smoked:

"When are you going to quit?"
"Come on, quit already!"
"I don't want you to get cancer!"
"Why are you spending money to poison yourself, are you stupid?"

They didn't skip a chance to make me feel bad about it. Now I am almost half a year smoke free and they congratulated me maybe once or twice for quitting and that was only in the beginning. Now when I overcome a craving and I need some reassurance, I have to brag about it in order to feel better: "hey, I am 150 days smoke free, hurray!" and they reply something like "good for you, man!". 

They never say it if I don't mention it, it sound so ungrateful. It's not like I did it for them, but if you are going to protest so passionately about something, use the same passion to show that you are happy that you finally got what you wanted.

At least you guys are here, you understand what I'm going thru and what I'm talking about.

It's just that sometimes I would prefer a compliment from a person I know in real life.

That was my little rant

I can't believe it's been thirty days! Now what?

I can't believe it's been a month! I was literally counting the hours during the first few days, and week-two was not pleasant, but now it all seems to have gone by in a flash.

I don't miss smoking, most of the time anyway. I had a bit to drink during Thanksgiving and actually told my SO (a smoker) that I wished I could have a cigarette. She said no, and the craving passed in about 30 seconds.

So, I am really worried about relapsing. I can totally see myself in six months, thinking "I'm not addicted anymore, I'll just smoke a couple per month" or some such nonsense. I know from past experience that if I even take a drag from a friend's cigarette, it will evolve into bumming cigarettes, to a pack a week, to a pack a day.

Has anyone had any close calls after the one-month mark? If yes, how did you overcome the temptation? Any advice for me going forward?

Also, to those who want quit or who are just starting out: Don't be afraid! Every time you overcome a craving, the next one will become easier. The anxiety, the restlessness, it's just the death throes of addiction, and it passes. Sink your teeth into your withdrawal symptoms and you'll win.

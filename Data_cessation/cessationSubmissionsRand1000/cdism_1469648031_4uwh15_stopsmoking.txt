700 days no alcohol and 4 days no nicotine.

I am feeling pretty good about both today! But still going pretty crazy ;P ! I smoked a pack a day since I was 12 and vaped the last 3 or so years (44 yrs old now) and progressively went down in mg - last Sunday I was puffing Zero completely and put all paraphernalia away Monday night. Any tips, suggestions, recommendations? Much appreciated!

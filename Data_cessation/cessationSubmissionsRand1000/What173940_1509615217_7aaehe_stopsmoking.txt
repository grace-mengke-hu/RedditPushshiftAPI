Uncomfortable

I'm going to try again in a few days. But I'm quite a heavy smoker and when I quit I'll bump into a few things.
When I don't smoke I feel uncomfortable. Especially in social situations. I don't know what to do or how to behave without a sig. It's sad I know, but I couldn't find any advice on this online.
Does anyone have experience on this and tips?

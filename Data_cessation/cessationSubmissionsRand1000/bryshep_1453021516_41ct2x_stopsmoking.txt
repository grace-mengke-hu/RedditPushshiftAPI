Has anyone had a slipup and gotten back on track?

I've quit for the past 6 months, and have been doing great, then me and my partner got in a fight. I smoked one, then vacation led to a few more, and now I have a pack in my pocket. Tomorrow after work (I'm a night shifter), I am going to throw these stupid smelly things away and start over. Has anyone else done this before? I feel like the cigarettes are reclaiming my brain, and I'm really nervous.

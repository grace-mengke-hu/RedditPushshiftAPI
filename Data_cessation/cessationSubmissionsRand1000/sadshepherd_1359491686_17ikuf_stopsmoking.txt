Some strange things that I haven't noticed people talking about/ a few questions nearly 2 weeks in

Before I start just want to say am extremely happy to be not smoking - get very strong cravings in the evening still but I don't care. Nearly caved a few times - to the point of holding a cig in my hand before giving it back to my friend - but did not!

Every morning I wake up and my lungs feel strange. Almost like that seared feeling of smoking the night before. Often my heart races extremely quickly too. I haven't started coughing anything up yet and I wonder if that has anything to do with it. Why haven't I coughed anything up? I've noticed no changes in smell or taste - other than the general feeling better about myself and not feeling sick all the time and hating smoking. 

I really want my body to purge everything out but it hasn't! I feel exactly the same as when I smoked.. I'm not producing any mucas or sputum or anything but my lungs do feel quite odd. Almost like a burning pressure. Any ideas? When did you guys start physically recovering?

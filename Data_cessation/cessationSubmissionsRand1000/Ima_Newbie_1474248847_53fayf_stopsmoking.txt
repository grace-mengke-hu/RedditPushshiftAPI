For anyone having a rough time of it the last couple days...

I just wanted to mention that we had a full moon last night, and it has some effects on the human body. For me, the few days surrounding a full moon always mess with my sleep. (I woke up every couple of hours last night.) I've felt a little extra on edge. My mood has been a little more off.

If you are skeptical about the effects of a full moon, I won't play holier-than-thou with my thoughts. I will throw in that the rate of births tend to go up during a full moon, and any teacher will tell you students are out of sorts during a full moon!

I just wanted to throw it out there in case it gave someone a little encouragement that they may feel increasingly better as the hours tick on (until the next full moon, lol.) In any case, don't give in and smoke... just go shout at the moon to leave you the hell alone. That alone will make you feel better (and give your neighbors something to talk about, hehe.)

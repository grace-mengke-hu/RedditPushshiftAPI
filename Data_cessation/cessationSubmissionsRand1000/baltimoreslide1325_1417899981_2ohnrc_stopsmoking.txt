I seem to get an edgy, bummer feeling after the initial withdrawl--around weeks 2-3. Tips?

Hi all,
I'm an on-and-off quitter since April-ish and I've made MAJOR progress: I've kicked a ton of mental triggers, often go at least a week.5 without smoking, etc. The trouble is that I do keep coming back. I chalked this up to drinking for a while, so I quit drinking, but I actually think there is a different problem going on.  
  
I think around day 9 or 10 I always feel a particular kind of on-edge, bummed out, less-than-connected, less-than-energized feeling. It's like a nervousness and a feeling that I cannot 100% engage with what I want to do. I'm used to being a fairly mentally intense person, thinking a lot and working on stuff, and around day 10 I usually get the feeling that I cannot reach that level of intensity for some reason.  
  
In the past, around this time I freak out a little, have a glass of wine and a smoke, and then return to non-smokerdom--except that this (no surprise!) has already become a slippery slope where I'm feeling more cravings.  
  
I probably have a certain degree of depression/anxiety/whatever but I'm used to dealing with these head on.  
  
I no longer fear days 1-7 but I *do* fear this weird day 10+ ennui. Can anyone help? I really want to just get past it into freedom land. Not having to destroy myself to feel normal is awesome and I want it all the time and consistently.  
  
Mega thanks to all and good luck!  
  
TL;DR: I seem to need a cigarette every 9 to 10 days or I get an unpleasant ennui that freaks me out. Asking how to get past that stage with minimal pain.

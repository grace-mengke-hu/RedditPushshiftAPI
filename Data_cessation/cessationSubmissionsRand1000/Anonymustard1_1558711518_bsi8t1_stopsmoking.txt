Day One!

I’ve been at it for about 3 months now. I can see the doom in the future though as my brothers been using chew for 7 years and my dads been using nicotine gum for 20 years. 

It seems the only way I can quit is if I literally don’t have enough money so I’ve left my money a days transfer away lol. I couldn’t get a pack right now if I wanted to and that’s the way it has to be since my willpower will fail if I can afford it. 

I’m also 5 days alcohol free which is the longest I’ve had in a year and a half. Trying to turn a corner at 29 y/o.

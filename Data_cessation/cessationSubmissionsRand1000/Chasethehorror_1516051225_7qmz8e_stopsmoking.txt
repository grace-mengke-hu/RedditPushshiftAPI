Is the one month mark technically 4 weeks or from date to date?

So I quit Wednesday, Dec 20th, and I'm wondering if I should celebrate my one month this Wednesday when it'll be four weeks exactly, or on Saturday when it'll be January 20th? I've been back on my diet/exercise routine to kick the pounds I gained from quitting and over the holiday, but figured I would treat myself with my favorite sushi dinner to celebrate. I also maybe wanted to brag a little bit to people. So how did you guys calculate it??

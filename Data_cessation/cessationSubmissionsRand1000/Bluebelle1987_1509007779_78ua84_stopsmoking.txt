Day five... went from needing lots of sleep to not being able to sleep! ðŸ˜³

Laying here awake, thinking about how great it would be to have a cig under the stars to help me fall asleep!

But no!
Not one puff ever.

Today may be challenging, but weighting out how good my body feels since itâ€™s been healing.... not worth having another cigarette and undoing all the hard work my body has done.

But why body?! Why are you keeping me awake?!

Aaaa. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜ž

Day 2: 24 year smoker, cold turkey quit

Comparisons to Day 1: 
Less cravings, think about smoking about half as much. At least 60% better concentration and focus. Seems like quitting will be easier today. Sense of smell starting to enhance, didnt cough up any crap this morning. (Sorry, but truth)

Still feeling very strong, much better progress than i thought i would make for my first attempt after a 24 year smoking career.

My advice to those looking to quit day 1: Have your last smoke beforee you go to sleep the night before. Youll then have a head start, 8 hours or so, into the first day. Much easier to quit while sleeping. Then take a nap in the afternoon after work or whatever to make it even easier. During the day walk off the worst cravings. Ive been walking at least 4-5 miles per day even a few weeks before i quit. It helped me prep for quitting and helps me sustain. Will also prevent gaining quitter weight.

Hour 66. I am losing my mind.

I can't think of anything other than smoking. And it feels like everything smells like cigarette smoke to me. I also can't find joy in anything anymore. Not movies, not tv shows, not even gaming. It's as if smoking made these otherwise boring things fun. I get this surreal thoughts that make me think I'm going crazy. I would appreciate some support.

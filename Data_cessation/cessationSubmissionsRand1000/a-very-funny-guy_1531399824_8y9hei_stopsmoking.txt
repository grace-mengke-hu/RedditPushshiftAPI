I was enjoying this new life but now not smoking is getting to me

I broke my all time record yesterday, I'm on day 9 now of not smoking any cigarettes. 

And I should feel so proud, so happy, but since yesterday I've started feeling down, it's getting to me that I have no vice anymore to occupy myself with in the day, when I get stressed I have no release but shouting and punching shit now, so much my neighbours told me to quiet down earlier. 

I see all of my friends still smoking, still enjoying their cigarettes, and I know I COULD SO EASILY GO BACK TO IT. I thought my spotty Chernobyl looking face would die down and go clean with my quit, but the spots have only grown ever more, I'm just as depressed as I was before I started.

I really want to fucking pack this shit in for good. But I'm losing morale, fast.

Grateful on Thanksgiving Day

What a perfect day to be grateful. Quit smoking on Thanksgiving day in 2012. Tomorrow I'll celebrate 3 years completely free from cigarettes and nicotine.

From a pack and a half a day smoker for 40 years to total freedom all thanks to a simple instruction book called "The Easy Way To Stop Smoking" by Mr. Allen Carr. 

Tried and failed every possible way to quit, some methods more than once. Learning the truth about my nicotine addiction, being made aware of the lies I believed about why I thought smoked and the lies about how hard it is to quit, I finally realizing that I wasn't going to die from a craving. This made quitting easy this time.

Grateful to my son, who introduced me to this book. Grateful to be a non-smoker today. I highly recommend this book to anyone who's ever thought, "I can't quit" because you can.

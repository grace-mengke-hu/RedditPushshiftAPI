went to the bar and didn't smoke

I had a quick hang with my friend at the beach. a couple of people were smoking my favourite cigarettes and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't vaguely tempted but I stayed strong. 

not drinking definitely helps. there's nooooo way I could do this while drinking. no idea what that's about.

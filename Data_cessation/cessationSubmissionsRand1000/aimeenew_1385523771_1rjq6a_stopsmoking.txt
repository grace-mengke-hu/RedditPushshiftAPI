6 weeks and 5 Days

I quit smoking on October 10th - a month after I found out I was pregnant.  2 weeks later I miscarried.  Despite the intense sadness I was going through I didn't give in to nicotine.  I didn't want this pregnancy to be for nothing but sadness.  I quit smoking and I am so proud.  I feel that that baby that couldn't be saved actually saved my life and I will always be grateful.  I am still very sad about our loss but I have never felt better mentally and physically.  My wallet is even happy! :) 

I will hit 7 weeks on Thanksgiving day so I will have something to TRUELY be thankful for.  So proud!

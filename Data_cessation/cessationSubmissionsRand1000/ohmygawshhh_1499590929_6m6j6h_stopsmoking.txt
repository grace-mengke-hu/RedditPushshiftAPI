I tried a different approach, tomorrow is day 3 and I'm a non smoker.

I had my last cigarette on Friday 07th July at 11pm, I stayed up to listen to an app I downloaded called Stop Smoking In Just Two Hours, its so cool. It just unbrainwashed me or something. It opened my eyes to the fact that I dont want to be a smoker, I never wanted to be a smoker. I just fell into it and I really had to try to become a smoker. 
Today was harder than yesterday but I had a bad sleep lastnight. 

Everytime my brain gives me that 'craving something' feeling I just acknowledge it and then remember that I don't need to smoke anymore, so I just starve it to death. 

Feeling good today, maybe ate too much food but its all baby steps :) 
Can I have a badge reset and I promise this time I wont put nicotine anywhere near me.

3 weeks!

Hey fellow quitters! Today is my 22nd day of being a nonsmoker. Things are going pretty good. I do get cravings occasionally, but nothing that would force my lazy ass to the store to buy smokes.


Unfortunately, I've been experiencing horrible cold-like symptoms for the past 5 days. Buckley's is my new addiction it seems. Hopefully this will pass soon...


Hang in there everyone and thanks for the support! :)

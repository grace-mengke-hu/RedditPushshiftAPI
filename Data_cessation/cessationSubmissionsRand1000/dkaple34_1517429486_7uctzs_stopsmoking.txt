Share your best nightmare!!!! My favorite is...

As you know quitting can cause nightmares, especially while on NRT or Chantix.  Today is day 30 and I have had one every night since quitting.  And they are vivid- haha. 

This week I had a dream that I was at a party and everyone was smoking.  I wanted one so bad but knew I had to resist.  Rather than smoking I did heroin instead!!!  WTF???  I woke up soaked in sweat believing I was now a heroin addict.  Oh the joys of quitting!!!

Post you favorite dream and share with the group. I know Iâ€™m not the only one and think this will be humorous. 

*PS- if you are a former heroin addict I apologize.  In no Way is this intended to be unsympathetic with real users.

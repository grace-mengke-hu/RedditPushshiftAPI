Day One here. Woke up with a lot of confidence. 1PM and cravings are working overtime.

I'm trying not to let it get to me. I'm trying to think of it as a feeling of beating the cravings into submission. I've got a paperback Easy Way copy sitting next to me that I finished months ago, but I'm hoping I've retained what I need to know to get through this.

I feel like I'm going to eat all the snacks and chew all the gum in the office. I feel like I can get through the work day fine, but I've got a bunch of stressful personal life stuff going on right now, so once I get home I don't know how I'm going to do it.

I've been lurking for months, and I was hoping my first post in r/StopSmoking would be about how easy it was for me to quit. Yet here I am trying not to freak out on day one. I'm almost 35, been smoking since I was 18, about half my life, and I want to be fucking done with it.

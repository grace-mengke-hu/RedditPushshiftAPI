The store clerk looked confused

My wife was working late, and I stopped at the local 7-11 after work yesterday to grab a six-pack.  I went to the register and the clerk, who recognized me from my every-other-day visits, asked, "Anything else?"  He hadn't seen me in a week.

I looked behind him to the wall of tobacco, in all its glory.  Cue the instant 10/10 craving.  $13 I wasn't about to spend (I always bought two packs).  I smiled and said "Not today.  And hopefully not tomorrow."

He gave me the   o_O   face, until he realized what I meant.  He smiled and said "Good."

One week down, many more to go.  It's getting easier, but is by no means easy yet.

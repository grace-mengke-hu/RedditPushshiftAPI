25 hours in...

I picked a terrible time to quit. I'm studying for a life-changing exam next week, dealing with family drama, and putting together a big project at work.

but... I know these things would be easier if I could do them without cigarettes. So I'm quitting so the next time I have to deal with something, I don't have to smoke to do it.

Happy 2 Years to me!!

I got one of the strangest tests ever along this past weekend and I'm here to let you know I still hate cigarettes!!


If you are 1 hour/day/week/month/year/decade in keeeeeeep goiiiiiing. 


The human mind is stronger than whatever it conjures up. Want to stop and I promise you will!! 

If I ever come back saying I did (which won't happen) I want you all to rip me a new one.

Love you guys thanks for inspiring me!! As a bonus my last day was on my mom's birthday. What a great gift to a mother!

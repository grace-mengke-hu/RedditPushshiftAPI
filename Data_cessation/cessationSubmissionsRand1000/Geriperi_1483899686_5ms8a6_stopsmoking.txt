About to start the process, a little piece of advice would be great

So I decided today that i want to quit smoking, but I know I can't quit directly from my 25 avg cigarretes a day to 0. Thats why I thought I can start smoking 10 or so per day for a week, then 9 the week after and so on. Do you think it is a good way to do it? Any advice would be great, thanks in advance

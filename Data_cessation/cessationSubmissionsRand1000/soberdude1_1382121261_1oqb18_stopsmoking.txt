Eleven Months!!!

40 year, pack and a half a day smoker here. Celebrating 11 months totally free from the slavery of cigarettes and nicotine addiction. "The Easy Way To Stop Smoking" put me in the correct mind set to finally stop slowly killing myself. I rid my body and life of tobacco and nicotine once and for all. Felt no need for patches, gum or pretend cigarettes. Cravings and withdrawal that were so mild, I didn't even notice them. It actually felt like I turned off the smoking switch. Grateful to Mr. Allan Carr and Reddit. Quitting is as easy as we believe it can be.

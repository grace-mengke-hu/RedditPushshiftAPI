More energy

Is an increased amount of energy a widespread phenomenon among people who quit smoking?

I mean, I did expect to have more energy, because I noticed in the past that whenever I felt productive in the morning, the first cigarette usually destroyed that. However, today is kind of shocking to me.

This entire week is going to be hell. I switched from night shift to early morning shift over the weekend. On Sunday I got some bad news which made it even more difficult to fall asleep, so I only got about 1.5 hours of sleep. Monday I worked for 8.5 hours, then had 3 long appointments afterwards. After 14 hours of work and work-related stuff I even resisted the urge to buy some fast food and went home to cook instead (WHAT?!). I went to bed right after to get 8 hours of sleep.

This morning I woke up and I feel GREAT. Like, seriously, damn. I was so goddamn productive yesterday and I can't wait to get more shit done today. If I smoked one cigarette right now, that would change into the opposite. I might even cancel my afternoon appointment.

I'm not entirely sure if my newfound status of "nonsmoker" is the sole reason, but it sure can't hurt.

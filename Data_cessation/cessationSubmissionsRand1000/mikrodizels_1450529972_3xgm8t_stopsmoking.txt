Here I go, back to square one.

God dammit, I was 2 and a half years in, maybe even more, even quit the subreddit after a year, because I did not even need to visit it anymore and I stopped counting the days, It was just taking space on my subreddit bar. Thanks to Allen Carr, I did not want to smoke, even when drinking and on social occasions.  
I even smoked about 1 cigarette a year on occasion, just to see what it was like to smoke and every time I tried it I just didn't see the point, and It reinforced me that i did not need cigarettes and they were disgusting and made me sick, because they were. It was going so well. Time after time I checked the subreddit I quit, just to see that Smiley-face star with a number like 537 or something and said to myself "Wow"... But I did relapse this november, because I wanted nostalgia, bought a small pack of smokes and was convinced that I wouldn't relapse. Yet I did, and It became a routine. Stupid boy...  
I'm starting again after a bit more than a month of smoking that I have done now, going to re-listen the Carr's audiobook and smoke my last ciggy when I am in the last chapters, like I did previously, since It worked so well the last time.  
I just wanna say, even after 2 years, maybe once a month, or even more rarely as time goes by, there will be a 5-minute time period, where you will consider starting again, and all you gotta do to is respond to yourself mentally [like this](http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x9/vandar_photo/Batman4.jpg) and it goes away. You will forget about it, while you are busy with your life. After a period of time, you will reflect on the past and be like "Hey, I completely forgot about my need to smoke this week/month/quarter/whatever, this is what not smoking feels like and I love it" My downfall was that, even after all that time, I gave in to a micro-moment... Those 2 and a half years with no smoking were great.  
Wish me luck, hopefully I'm dropping smoking permanently.

Thank you to everyone on this sub.

A few days ago my girlfriend and I broke up. She has never had much a childhood as she looked after her younger siblings and didnâ€™t have too many friends. 

After 11 months smoke free i went bought a pack... and then a second. I posted on this sub about it and got some amazing advice. Tonight she and I went for drinks, and talked it out. We are not getting back together, at least not until we both sort ourselves out for a while. 

I will not be buying a third pack, because of you guys. This sub may help many people quit but it is also helped me with other issues. I stay subbed to this to see peoples smokefree journeys starting. 

Thank you all who commented, and god bless you all for being there for each other every day.

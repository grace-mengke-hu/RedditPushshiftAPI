Fourth day, can’t get out of bed

After smoking for six years I’m trying to quit while actually on a family camping trip in SC. Lots of reasons to quit but I guess the big reason is I someday want to get pregnant and I’d rather be ready when the right time strikes. I’m on my fourth day. I thought day one cravings were the worst but I had a crazy one last night on day three. I started getting thoughts like “the guilt of smoking would be easier than the difficulty of quitting.” Today, I’m so depressed I can’t get out of bed. I sort of know cognitively that the cigs would taste bad even at this early point, but I still want them. I’m using the patch after trying to quit cold turkey multiple times. I’ve been chewing regular mint gum to help, but my mouth is covered in sores from all the chewing. Feeling like today is the day I’ll cave. Hoping i find strength.

Finally quit nicotine lozenges!

53 days into my quit, but I finally gave up NRT on Saturday night. It's been over 36 hours with no nicotine. It's not easy, but it's getting slightly easier. I can't wait for the detox to be over with.

Just excited, exhausted, and ready to startt the next chapter of my life, nicotine-free.

Struggling on Day 10

Most days have been manageable, but yesterday and today have been tough.  I'm guessing bc last night at 9:30 pm was 72 hours 100% nicotine free.  I really don't want to go back on nrt, but I have plenty left since I only used it for about a week.  I don't want to smoke, but I'm emotional and struggling to self soothe in other ways when those emotions pop up.  I still feel pretty crappy, which isn't helping either.  Curse the inventor of cigarettes, ugh.

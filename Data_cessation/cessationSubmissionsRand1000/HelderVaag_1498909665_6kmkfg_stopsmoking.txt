On holiday with smokers

The sound of the water, sand between my toes, sounds like a dream doesn't it? Well.. I am on my 6th day of the quit and surrounded by smokers, which is making my holiday being filled with anxiety instead of enjoyment. I really hope I can get over it and start to relax.. Any tips?

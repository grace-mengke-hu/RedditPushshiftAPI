Why do (did?) we smoke? I know why I did...

-"Smoking kills." 

-I know. We know. All of us know. 

-"Why do you smoke? Are you stupid?" 

-"Yes." I say, laughing. 

-"Seriously."

Well...

I started in a somewhat unusual way. Later than most people as well. In 2009, 2010, I was 24-25... I started smoking pot with some friends. Before I started smoking I was going through a depresion. Pot actually acted like an antidepressant. It actually helped me at that point in my life. A lot. We mixed tobacco. I very rarely smoked cigarettes at the time. Sometimes it would feel good. I'd feel a little light headed. A little high. But the nicotine came to me almost always mixed with the other stuff. I used to smoke almost every single day. I would smoke sometimes just a little. Sometimes a lot. In 2011 I stopped smoking pot. For good. I felt I didn't need it anymore. I was feeling better with my life. And it was so easy... it didn't feel like I stopped using a drug. At all. I didn't smoke cigarettes as well. Until one night, about 6 months later. I was drunk. I smoked a cigarette. If felt good. It felt REALLY good. I felt I missed something. The nicotine. I started smoking casually from then on. Nothing too much.

Then, at the end of 2012, me and a girl I was with stopped seeing each other. The depression came back. I started buying packs of cigarettes. I felt better. This was my new "antidepressant". Life stopped sucking so much. For many reasons. I mostly started enjoying being alone. And the cigs were there with me. I was never truly alone. I started enjoying going for walks by myself. I went to live and work abroad. The cigs were my companion. I crossed Europe several times from West to East and back since 2013. One of my favourite things ever since that time, has been to randomly go to a coffee shop terrace in Bratislava, Slovakia. In Lviv, Ukraine. In Madrid, Spain. In Lisbon, Portugal. Sit down alone with a good book. Or sit down with friends or friendly locals. And smoke. The cigarettes were always there.

Why do I smoke? It made me feel better in my hour of need. And I like it.

It is also killing me. I will very likely die younger because of it.

I don't believe we are going somewhere after we die. It really makes no sense that I'm shortening my lifespan because of this. Since I turned 30 in 2015 I've been thinking of leaving behind this habit. My throat feels weird. "Why the fuck do I keep doing this?" This doesn't make sense. "Maybe I do want to kill myself. Slowly. Not in a fuckin' dramatic way like cutting my wrists or some stupid shit like that. But by knowingly giving myself cancer or heart disease. Yeah. I deserve it. Fuck you, me! Well... I'm going to smoke another one." And then I would smoke another one. But now they didn't taste as good. They haven't been tasting all that great lately. "I should quit... but I don't have the strenght to do so... and I'm going to work abroad again during the whole summer... and they're so cheap in eastern europe..."

Last week I reduced my usual half a pack to 3 cigs a day. Didn't feel much of a difference. 29 Hours ago I had my last cigarette. It's probably not the last I'll ever have in my life. But fuck it. Above everything I'm a very lazy guy. And I don't feel like buying more cigarettes. So I won't.

Now it's 23:17 in my country. This day passed well. I could have smoked a cigarette. I didn't want to. I'm starting to change my daily habits. Starting to drink more coffee instead of smoking. Starting to chew on toothpicks when I feel like having a cig. At least it gives me something to do with my mouth and hands. I just emulate it. So far, so good. Tomorrow is a new day.

**I know why I smoked. I also know why I'm stopping. I don't want to die early. It is just not worth it.**

**And what about you guys? Why did you smoke? Why did you stop?**

**TL;DR**: Started smoking pot while depressed; stopped smoking pot. Got more depressed, smoked cigarettes. Faced with my own notion of mortality I decided to stop.

1 week in and other urges are surfacing. Fact check please. (very honest, and slightly NSFW)

day 8 now, and realising one thing, need to check with all you quitters if it's just me.

Previously i read here that post day-5, the physical withdrawal is done with and the rest is mental. that, i get. but nobody said it was HARDER without the physical withdrawals. it's like, now i have nothing to blame for the cravings =(

secondly, i'm perpetually hungry. AND horny. i'm 31 but i'm as horny now as i was when i'm 18. i'm talking random boners, thinking about sex every 3 seconds, looking at girls and thinking "damn i'll tap that."

where prior to quitting, i could go a week without wanking, it seems to have become a nightly thing.

so, fellow quitters, is this.. "un-suppressing" of other urges/cravings/desires a part of quitting smoking? or does smoking somehow decrease testosterone and now i'm adjusting to increased levels of testosterone and feeling the effects? (impulsiveness, sex drive)

i don't like this change in myself.

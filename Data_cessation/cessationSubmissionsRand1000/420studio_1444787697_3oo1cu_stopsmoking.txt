Day 15 feeling like day 1

Just craving after craving today it is terrible. I've been out drinking a couple times now and the cravings then were nothing compared to today. Feeling depressed over stupid things and in my head it just keeps saying "you know what would make this better right??" or "screw it man, you might as well just buy a pack" it is terrible today. By far the worst day I've had thus far.

Not breaking though. Fuck that and fuck this stupid junkie brain of mine.

Symptoms a month after quitting

So, for some reason that I don't understand, my gums have been bleeding lately.  They bled occasionally when I was smoking - usually when I switched toothbrushes - but they've bled a couple times this week.  I'm vaping, so I'm not sure if it's the quitting, the vaping, or something else entirely. 

Also, yesterday evening my throat started getting sore.  Now, this could just be because it's gotten cold here recently so the heat is on everywhere all of a sudden.  It's just strange, usually my 'seasonal' sore throat shows up some morning after the heat goes on, not in the afternoon/evening.  Again, I'm not sure if it's the quitting, the vaping, or something else.  Oddly, I'm experiencing no other symptoms of being sick - my nose is fine, my chest is fine, no fever...  Just a sore throat, and only up top - it doesn't even hurt to cough, only swallow.  

Just wondering if this is relatively normal stuff for folks who have quit, or are quitting using vaping.  I don't go to the doctor for simple things like a sore throat, but I'd still like some reassurance.

is depression my bigger problem?

I have been trying to quit on and off since January. The past few weeks however, I have failed to make it over a single 24 hour interval without slipping up. I throw my cigs out EVERY night, shower, give my teeth a well deserved clean and head to bed. I lie in bed for an hour every night, having panic attacks each time I start to doze off, every 10 or 15 minutes. It is almost as if my mind does not want my body to rest.

I wake up every morning feeling decent about the day, make some coffee and head to class. Throughout the day my depression and anxiety become incrementally worse, mostly due to the thoughts of a relationship I was forced to end 4 months ago. It was riding on 5 years, 5 years of me being walked on and stabbed in the back. It's the reason that each day I start to remember how much I hate myself for never putting my foot down and how much I hate my life, my past. How I'm going to die young anyway, and how I'm too fucked up to ever have a true relationship again. Every day, the cycle won't end.

Cigarettes make me feel something. I can't explain it but I know you understand. They fill that hole, and serve as a friend. They're as good a friend as any I've ever had. Not a good one.

I have been seeing a therapist every 2 weeks for the past couple of months. Nothing has changed, if anything things have worsened. But I feel I need to improve mentally before I can take on another battle. I'm only 19 and I feel like a middle aged man battling depression and abusing alcohol.

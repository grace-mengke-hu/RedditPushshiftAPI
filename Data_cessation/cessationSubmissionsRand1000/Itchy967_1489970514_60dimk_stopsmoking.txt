9 days quit. I can already breathe better which means I can finally rap battle with my 7 year old son.

And he still kicks my ass. But I can do a verse with him without getting winded now. That's only one of my weird goals for quitting. 

Another one is so I can call the life insurance company who refused me insurance in a year or two, get a quote from them and pick a new company. Never underestimate the power of the spite, my friends. 

I have good reasons too, but I would be lying if I said the silly ones aren't what are getting me through.

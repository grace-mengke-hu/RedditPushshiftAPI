Been MIA, life is good

HI all. I'm still not smoking. I am on Week 4 Day 2 of C25K program and I guess I'm running a 10K in October.

I've been a bit MIA. I had a health scare about a month ago. I have a long history of cancerous/pre cancerous polyps in colon. Last year, one was quite large and cancerous. Symptoms were getting worse again, so we scheduled the next round of biopsies. Surprisingly, the growths this year showed no evidence of cancer. WOOT! 

It was not what we expected to find and I'm taken it as a chance to continue to be healthy and take care of me. As the doctor said "I'm a ticking time bomb but I can delay it by being healthy"

So here I am. Yay. 

I'll have a second set of biopsies in 6 months. If all clear again, I can go 2 years this time. WOOT!

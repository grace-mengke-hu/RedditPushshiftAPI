Cravings don’t pass

Smoked a pack a day for a decade - quit cold turkey 6 weeks ago.  Indulged in an old trigger tonight - pasta and a bottle of red wine. I need a cigarette so badly.  I want to buy two packs and smoke them both.  

For the people who, after a month or so, say the cravings last for 3-5 seconds, what the fuck is your secret? My fucked up brain would rather suffer addiction than withdrawal. 

Perhaps a dumb question: is there something I can smoke that isn’t nicotine, cancerous, or addictive?

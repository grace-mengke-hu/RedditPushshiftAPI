Interesting conundrum

I have been smoking for 40 years or so now, so have also quit more times than I care to remember. One of the things I find quite funny is that cigarettes taste so disgusting after a break, that you almost have to try as hard to start smoking again as you do to stay smoke free. I am determined to do it this time, and not persevere smoking those first few 'I can't hack this quitting' game

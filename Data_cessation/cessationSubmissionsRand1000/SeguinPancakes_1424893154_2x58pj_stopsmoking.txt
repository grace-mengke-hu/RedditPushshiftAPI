Day two, getting ready for a smoke free home.

I'm 24 years old and have been smoking since I was 18/19, but I had my last cigarette Monday night, In preparation for my husband and I closing on our first house yesterday. Well, things got in the way with the closing and it's postponed till next week, but I'm determined to leave this habit and not bring it with me to our new home. This is the place I want to be a "grown up" in after college dorms and downtown apartments. This is where I want to raise my kids eventually. I don't want to be a smoker here. So now I have a weeks head start and I really want it to work this time. I'm not going to vape or anything this time. I just want to be done. Wish me luck!

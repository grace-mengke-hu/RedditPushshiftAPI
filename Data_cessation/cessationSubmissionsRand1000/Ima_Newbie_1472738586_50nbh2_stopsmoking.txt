Three weeks is finally here! Did I actually do this???

Did I successfully go 3 weeks without smoking a cigarette? Why yes, yes I did. The 3rd week kind of flew by actually, compared to the 1st & 2nd.

I will not be complacent. I will not fall to urges. I've quit before and know first-hand the danger of "just one smoke can't hurt."

For anyone interested, this helped me: 

* This Subreddit (Reading and posting.)
* Allen Carr's book (I had just quit but was chewing the gum. His book got me off ALL nicotine.)
* Smoke-Free app

(The last two I found out about by reading on this sub, so thanks guys!)

Benefits so far:

* Sense of smell is amazingly enhanced.
* I feel calmer.
* I don't get as winded at the gym.
* Don't have to crave a smoke and plan my life around it.
* Clothes, hair, breath & car smell fresh.
* More energy over all.

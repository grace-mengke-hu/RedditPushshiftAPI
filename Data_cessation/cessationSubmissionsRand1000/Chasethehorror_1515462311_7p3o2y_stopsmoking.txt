Anyone else PMSING??

Iâ€™m on day 19 (flair is wrong sorry) without second thoughts, but started PMSing a few days ago. Iâ€™m depressed and anxious and miserable and bored and I keep thinking of smoking!! 

But I know it wonâ€™t fix my PMS symptoms, maybe temporarily for a little bit not for good. I know if I push through this month, then next month Iâ€™ll be able to deal with PMSing without thinking of cigarettes like this! 

Iâ€™m not gonna smoke but I am going to drink wine and wish that this was over!ðŸ˜­

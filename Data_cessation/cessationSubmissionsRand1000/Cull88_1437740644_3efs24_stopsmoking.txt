I will do this...

I went 84/85 days smoke free and BLEW it after making a mistake by having a joint. I didn't even think about the nicotine and what it had actually done, until a couple of days after that joint I got offered a cig and I didn't even think twice. Next day I had another cig, day after that 2 - 3 cigs... and, you get the picture. I'm back to 10 a day after just 3 weeks and I feel like shite. It's not until you quit you realise just how bad cigs make you feel. Tomorrow is my quit day, tonight I will prep myself, get back into the frame of mind and do it. I will be here again people. Wish me luck...

Relapsed after 8days. Feeling pathetic!

I was a pack a day smoker for 7years. Today had a beer at 12 noon, which was very weird and just didn't think and smoked a cigarette. After lunch smoked another. :(

Posting this just after the second smoke. I feel pathetic and don't want to smoke anymore. I don't want to reset counters here or on the mobile apps I am using. Is there still hope?

PS: I am on NRT.

I literally shouted at a pack of smokes last night

Yeah, I was hammered. Was at a party. 5 days no nicotine. Everything died down and someone left half a cig out. No one saw me but I caved and had it. Got home, grab the back I had in a box in my nightstand for a week, and the real relapse happens. I chain-smoked about three or four then I remember just being mad. Mad at myself, but mostly at the cigarettes. I destroyed all the ones I had left. And I totally was just yelling and a pile of tobacco in the trash can. "You don't own me anymore!", Etc. 


So, I started the five days no drinking either and now I remember why.  Anyways, if you're at the point where you're shouting at inanimate objects, you should probably look into a few other bad habits, so that's what I'm doing. Gonna put down the liquor for a while.

75 days of win

I smoked for 11 years. I had quit so many time before, and I know everyone might say this, but all of them taught me a little bit more about my specific personal nicotine addiction.

In 2017, I quit no less than 27 times. I quit every other week. Monday I would swear it off and Friday I would buy a pack. I spent more time not smoking last year than I did smoking.

What I was really addicted to was taking breaks, taking a step out, and just not caring. I thought I couldn't handle my own emotional rollercoasters.

I know Alan Carr said not too, but Alan Carr said a lot of things I disagreed with, so for the first month I used the patch. I used the patch specifically to show myself the *even* with a constant stream of nicotine, I would *still* have emotional ups and downs - I would still freak out and need a break from whatever I was doing (mostly work).

And I was right. The patch helped me realize that holy shit, nicotine doesn't even help me anymore. I taught myself breathing techniques and come centering mantras I made up to bring myself down when I needed it.

When I was drinking, I didn't smoke, because I wore the patch, and I know if I smoked it would make me really sick. So I didn't. I got used to not smoking while drinking.

After a month, I took the patch off. The instructions said make sure to go throughout the entire program, but it also said some other stuff I didn't agree with, so I didn't listen. It was making me sick, and by this point I knew I didn't even need the nicotine, because it wouldn't help. I was addicted to the habit of bringing myself down when I was riled up - and I had learned to do that without smoking.

After I took the patch off my body came into equilibrium and guess what? I have all the same problems, except I don't smoke anymore.

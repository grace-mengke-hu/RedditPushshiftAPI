I was a non smoker before and I'll be one agaib

 I just had a cigarette and thought deeply how I "think" it helps me. I feel like it has been my crutch for six years. It's been my buddy through thick and thin. It's gotten me through social anxiety, stress, depression, and it was something to do with my friends. The reality though is that it is literally killing me. My lungs hurt, im lethargic all the time, I have trouble waking up in the morning, I can't maintain an erection, I can't do cardio, it stains my fingers and teeth, makes me smell bad, makes my car smell bad, wastes my money, makes me more stressed out, makes me anxious, it's going to give me cancer one day, it will give me a heart attack, makes my chest hurt. It's time I be a man and grow up and move on. I need to rely on myself as a crutch. And find support systems like the gym, groups online, stop smoking programs, friends, family. I need to look for things to satisfy my oral fixation like gum, straws, cinnamon sticks, tooth picks. I need to occupy my time while bored with music, reading, chores, errands. I need to avoid triggers like alcohol bars and coffee. I need to avoid being around cigarettes for a little bit. I can do this. I am a non smoker

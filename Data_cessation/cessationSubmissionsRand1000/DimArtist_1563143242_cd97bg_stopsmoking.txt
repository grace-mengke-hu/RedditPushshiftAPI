It's all about the money, I guess

I counted my income and my expenses and all I thought was to quit smoking to save money. Now I recounted my expenses and I saw I have some money to spend for the filthy, damaging and expensive habit of smoking.

I just realized that the only reason I want to quit is money. Nevertheless I enjoy smoking and my daily life around it. I am 31 and I don't realize how smoking damages my health, maybe I don't care? If I was a millionaire or I had a couple hundred of euros in my bank account I would still be smoking.

I am trying to convince myself even more on how to quit smoking. And I guess I need your help. My mindset is not ready for quitting smoking yet, I guess.

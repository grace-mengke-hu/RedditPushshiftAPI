I know this sounds crazy, but...

I've been trying to quit for well over a year. I have every reason to quit. It's way too expensive, especially since the cigarette tax where I live increased by $2 a pack a few months ago. It's destroying my teeth. I'm back in school so I can get into a career in healthcare, and smoking is definitely a handicap in the field I want to get into. My husband quit successfully months ago after having a stroke and he hates that I continued after that. I don't even like it anymore. Even with all these compelling reasons, I still haven't been able to stop for more than a couple of days.

But I think I've finally stumbled onto the one motivation that has helped me quit successfully. 

I'm training for a triathlon.

This isn't as crazy as it sounds. I already swim and bike almost every day, and I've added running to the mix. While smoking has definitely impaired my cardiovascular endurance, my performance in all three sports has improved considerably since I quit a few days ago. The triathlon I want to do is a little over a year away and it's a small one - half mile swim, 3.1 mile run, 20.5 mile bike ride. I'm already close to doing those distances.

But it is going to take some work to get there. I'm using Joe Friel's method for developing an annual training program. As long as I remain smoke free and continue training like I have, my goal of completing this mini-triathlon is within reach.

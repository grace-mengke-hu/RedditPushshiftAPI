3,000+ day quitter here. I totally forgot I was a smoker, but when I remembered, I remembered how helpful this subreddit was. You can do it. It gets easier every day.

Read The Book. Want to Quit. Quit, and dont touch it. 

3 hours.

3 days.

3 weeks.

3 months.

3 years.

Each of those milestones is as hard as the previous one, but you can see how it stretches out. The first 3 hours has the total craving power as the first 3 days, as the first 3 weeks, etc. It dies. Dont falter or you give it life.

You just have to choke this motherfucker out.

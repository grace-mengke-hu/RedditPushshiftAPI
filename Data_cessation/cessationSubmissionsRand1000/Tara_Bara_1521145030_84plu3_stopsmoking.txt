Quitter's Flu with NRT?

Hi All,

Ignore the badge, cause I'm on Day 10. I started off using the 21 mg patch with 4 mg gum (the InterWeb said Combination Therapy was ok, so that's what I did). Quickly realized I might be going into nicotine overdose (dizzy, fatigue, nausea), so I got rid of the patch yesterday and just used the gum.

I'm still feeling extremely exhausted, brain-foggy, and dizzy. Like, I just want to lie down (but I have to work, dangit!) The reason I got on NRT was to minimize these feelings so I could get used to life without the cigs, but sh*t...I might as well be doing cold turkey. I've done it CT before, and it's actually no different (CT was better, in that at least the brain fog was gone after the first few days).

My resolve is pretty tough this go around, but let me tell ya I was tempted to go to the corner store today. Anything to feel better. So my question is "can you still experience withdrawal even when using NRT?" Maybe the NRT is what's making me sick? 

I've tried so many things to quit smoking, and I feel I need SOMETHING to help me out. Insurance doesn't cover Chantix, my body breaks out in hives from Wellbutrin, and apparently, my body don't like NRT either. But CT has always been impossibly hard for me. 

Any advice or input would be greatly appreciated, thanks.

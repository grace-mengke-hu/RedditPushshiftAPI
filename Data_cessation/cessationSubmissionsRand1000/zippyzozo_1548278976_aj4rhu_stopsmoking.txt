Insecurity

So randomly, I've smoked heavily since 13yrs old, and had a few quit attempts, gone cold Turkey this time and just feel so emotional, feel really insecure, the emotions that are coming out are unreal. I've always thought I'm so level headed and confident but I feel so unsure of myself now, it's like I dont know myself at all?

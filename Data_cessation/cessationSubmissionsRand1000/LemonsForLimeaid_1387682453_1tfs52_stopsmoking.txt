Been over a year...

And didn't even realize. Only reason I realized was because a post from this sub was buried as I was scrolling my subs and decided to check it. 

Here is where I am at. 370 days in, zero desire to smoke, smoke doesn't incite or repel any desires, I am literally indifferent. I quit cold turkey and honestly, for myself at least, after 3 days it was cake. No book, no e-cigs, just freedom. 

I think I may be different from others though. I don't attribute amazing will power to my success because that would mean I had to "fight" the addiciton, but I really didn't. I had a cigar in the summer time when golfing, but I don't consider it failing because I knew it wouldn't lead to anything, which it didn't.

This isn't my first dog and pony show though, all of 2010 I was smoke free and then smoked again until I quit this time. I began around ten years ago, but really smoked regularly about 7 years ago to give some context.

Anyway not sure what I want to accomplish with this post, but those of you fighting the good fight, continue so and don't succumb!

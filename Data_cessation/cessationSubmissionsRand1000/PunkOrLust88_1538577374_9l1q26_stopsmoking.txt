Day II

Day two today, day one was definitely a struggle but I got through it.  Feeling really emotional and anxious, but also feeling a littel bit healthier and energized, hoping I stick to it and start feeling like myself again soon.  Afarid of losing steam and relapsing, but I'm just gonna take it one hour at a time.

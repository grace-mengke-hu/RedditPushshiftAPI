Well.. my vacation starts officially at 11PM tonight and...

I am 18 days into quitting cold turkey. One of the big reasons I wanted to quit is because I was tired of hiding the nasty habit from my family. They were very proud of me when I quit for two years, and I have been hiding it for the last year, because I didn't want to disappoint them by giving in after those two years.

So here I am, almost three weeks with zero nicotine, and very little cravings. I am leaving for a cruise at 5AM tomorrow morning with the family, and I am very happy to say I will NOT be sneaking away to some unknown part of the ship to hide and smoke a cigarette. Or leaving my cabin in the wee hours of the morning to run outside. 

And aside from that, I feel great. I haven't had a craving in days. I haven't even thought of cigarettes in days before making this post. 

For all of you just starting out.. you can do it. Remember your reasons for wanting to quit and stick with it.

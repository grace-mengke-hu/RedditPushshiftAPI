I can't sleep

I've spent half the night tossing and turning - I stepped down my patches on Saturday so the nicotine no doubt factors in, but I'm realllly stressed about work too. 

I'm at the doctors this morning for an unrelated reason but tempted to get a higher dose of my meds which I already take for sleep / anxiety. 

Anyone else here take medication for this?

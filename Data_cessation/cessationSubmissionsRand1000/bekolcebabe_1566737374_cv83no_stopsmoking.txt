Just been to the supermarket where I usually buy my weekly carton of cigarettes, went to the cigarette counter to check their vape refills-the lady behind the counter who knows me well asked “your usual?”-felt good to say no I quit,&amp; you are never ever allowed to sell me another packet!

Felt even better to see how pleased they were for me,&amp; proud to show them my smokefree app data. I told them to tell all the other ladies not to sell me cigarettes either-it’s good my brand can sometimes be hard to find!

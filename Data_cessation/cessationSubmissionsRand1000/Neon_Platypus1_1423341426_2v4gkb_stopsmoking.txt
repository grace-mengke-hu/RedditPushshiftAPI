Got drunk last night and didn't smoke. It's the little victories...

I went to my buddy's place for his birthday shindig last night, promising myself to only have a beer or two. I'm known to light up and chain smoke when I'm drunk/tipsy, so I was worried about going out. Luckily, I managed to get fairly drunk and only had one minor craving when I saw someone whip a cigarette out. 

The best part is that I usually wake up after a drunken night out with a clogged up chest, a killer headache, and a stale taste in my mouth. Today I woke up with a slight hangover, but otherwise I felt great. 

It really does get easier after three days. It's a wonder why I never noticed these things the other thousand times I quit.

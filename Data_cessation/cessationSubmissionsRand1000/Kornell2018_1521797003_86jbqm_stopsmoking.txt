From Smoker to NonSmoker and back?

Hey All

Here is the story of my smoking.

I used to smoke for around 8 years. After i quit for 10 months. Had some family emergency and started smoking again for like around a year. 

After, i quit again and didn't smoke for 3 years. But last summer, i started smoking one cig here, one there. It all came to the fact that i smoke everytime i go out to drink or have a meal with friends. I am not into buying a pack and starting smoking thats for sure, but for example yesterday in a restaurant i smoked 7 cigarettes, when last time i smoked was 5 days ago. This 5 days i dont have any withdrawal. I maybe want to smoke once a while, but usually it comes after a social event. 

Any suggestions? I wanna quit FOR GOOD. Like i did for three years. I just can't concentrate on this anymore. Plz help

Shameful post

Recently picked up smoking again... not as much as I smoked in the past but it still smoking. I hate it so much. I feel as if I've let down you guys and myself so much. I feel ashamed. It's hard to post this because it kinda makes me a hypocrite. I'm resetting my badge too because I don't deserve it. 

I'm thankful for the support during my smoke free days though. 

I'm quitting again today. I don't want to live my life like this anymore. 

Sorry if I disappoint anyone here :(

Thanks for reading.

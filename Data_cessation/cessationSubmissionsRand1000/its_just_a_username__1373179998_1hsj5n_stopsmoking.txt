2 days ago, I got drunk and smoked 2 cigarettes. Didn't pick up smoking again.

I was at a birthday party and decided to have a cigarette (lately I was thinking about having just one), even though I haven't smoked in more than 3 months. My gf was there too, I told her what I planned to do. She said "only if you promise not to start smoking again". 

I smoked 2 cigarettes that night, I was disappointed because they didn't feel good at all. Smoking was strange, felt unnatural. Yesterday I woke up hungover and realized I smoked. I thought I made a mistake and had to reset my counter. Nope.

While that technically counts as a failure, I will not reset my counter. I didn't pick up smoking again, I don't feel addicted again at all, it's like I didn't smoke that night. No harm done.

I think it was even a positive thing, it reminded me why I stopped smoking in the first place.

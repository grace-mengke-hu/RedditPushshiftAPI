I'm sure this has been posted a thousand times, but I had my first smoking dream and it was a doozy.

I don't recall what went through my mind at the time, but I ordered cigarettes from the store and some old guy delivered them on foot.  I took two drags and then it hit me what I was doing.  I imediately flushed it down the toilet and felt kind of panic-stricken, wondering what the hell I was going to do. 

I considered logging in here to ask y'all if two puffs was enough to reset my badge, because I really didn't want to have to do that.  But for some reason I lit another cigarette, slowly taking it all in to see how I felt about smoking again.   I didn't like it one bit.  For the rest of the dream I felt depressed and disappointed.

When I awoke... I can't describe how happy I felt.  Maybe like Scrooge on Christmas morning.  It truly was a wonderful feeling to know that I'm still a non-smoker.

Anyway, have a happy smoke-free Sunday, everyone!

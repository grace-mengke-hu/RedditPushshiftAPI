11 days, some nrt still

I made it 3 days without nrt, but didn't want to push it when the cravings started feeling unmanageable at work.  So, I'm keeping the nicotine lozenges in hand for now.  Anything nrt is better than smoking.  

I feel better in some ways, worse in others.  I'm actually having allergic reactions to.my allergy shots for the first time.  Could be other variables, dose of shots is higher (almost made it to maintenance level!), Spring, etc... But I'm pretty convinced some of it is due to not smoking, so not having the numbing from cig smoke letting my allergies show up in full force.

I feel more energy, but it's still an antsy type of energy.  Small yoga sessions help, but don't completely cure that.  Sleeping okay, dreams are more lucid and vivid, and some night terrors, but I have is of that anyways.

Venting and processing here has really helped me a lot.  Irl, people who aren't quitting get tired pretty quick of hearing about it.  

25/26 years of smoking, 11 days in.  Still worth it, even though I needed nrt again.  Gonna keep going!

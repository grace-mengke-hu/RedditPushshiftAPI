I messed up again...

So on Thursday night I ended up giving in and smoking...a lot. I'm really annoyed  because I was so close to reaching the two week point. Gonna re-set my badge  as soon as I can, in the mean-time I'd like to ask any quitters out there about your slip-ups and how you managed to overcome them!

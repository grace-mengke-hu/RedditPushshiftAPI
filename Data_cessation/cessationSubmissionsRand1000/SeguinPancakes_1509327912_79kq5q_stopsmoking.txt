4 days since quit day

"Quit" Thursday and smoked one cigarette Friday from a co worker and haven't since. I felt so ashamed. Feeling really good about getting past the first couple days now with only gum and toothpicks. Really worried about work tomorrow...I'm a bartender so lots of triggers/smokers around. But I've made it this far. I can do this.

2 days without smoke, but not without nicotine

This is my 7 millionth quitting attempt. Alright, maybe it's not that bad. But I've tried to quit before, and I've fallen through before. Most of my failings have come when trying to go cold turkey - I do believe that this is probably the best way, if you can do it.

But I can't go cold turkey. I have never made it past day 1 cold turkey. I get drunkingly dizzy, and I can't really be productive in that state - and if I try to do this in the weekend, I'll cave in too quickly.

So I have fallen back on nicotine gum. I used gum years back when I was training martial arts and wanted to quit the smokes. After a couple of rough starts in the past few weeks (Oh look, I've made it 24 hours on the gum, let's celebrate with a smoke!), I am happy to say that it's over 48 hours since I last had a cigaret. I think it's going pretty well. There have been weak moments, but I have managed to push through them.

But I don't want to continue with this gum forever. The point is to stop the dependency on nicotine, and I don't want to just move my money spending over to nicotine gum. So how do I get off this stuff quickly? Does anyone have any succes stories with nicotine replacements?

I read some studies, and it seems like up to freaking 97% of people trying to quit with nicotine replacements go back to smoking within 6 months. I was stunned from this number. I'd like to be in that 3%. I want to get off the gum within a month, preferably within a week.

Anybody able to chip in?

*Side question: Do you consider my "quit date" the last day I had a cig, or the last day I had a nicotine gum?*

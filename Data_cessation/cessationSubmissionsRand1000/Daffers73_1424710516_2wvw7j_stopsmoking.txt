I've just bought 0mg vape liquid..

I found even after 3 weeks the cravings can be bad and even though I don't want another cigarette I've come close a couple of times to caving in.. I haven't but to stop it happening again I've just bought a new base and 0mg liquid to use in my old e-cig when I feel like I'm going to cave. It's purely for when it gets bad but I'd rather use that than end up smoking a cig then feeling rubbish after.

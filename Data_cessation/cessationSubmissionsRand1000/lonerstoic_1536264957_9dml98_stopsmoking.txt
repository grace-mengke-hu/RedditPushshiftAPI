Cut Down For Health?

I don't feel motivated or confident about being able to fully quit smoking.  I'm simply too addicted.  It might be my favorite thing to do, to sit and think with a cig.  I have nothing to replace it with.  And being poor, it's one of my few indulgences (a lot of poor people smoke).

I was wondering if smoke 3-5 cigs a day would be a benefit to my health compared to a pack a day?

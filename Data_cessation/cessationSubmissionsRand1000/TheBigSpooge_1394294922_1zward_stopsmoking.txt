Day 2

So, after debating with myself for a long time how I was going to go about this, I decided to try out cold turkey.  I figured that if I start on Friday, then I will get over some of the worst anger/irritability issues by the time I have to teach my class of illiterate ingrates on Tuesday.

Anyway, I'm on day 2, I have a full day of work ahead of me, and I can't concentrate for shit.  My head feels like it's in a vise.  My stomach feels weird, like it's not digesting anything I'm eating, and I've already gained about four pounds.  Seriously.  On Wednesday I was 171, and today I was 175.  At this rate, any attractiveness I accrue from quitting smoking will almost certainly be canceled out by my pendulous gut and man-bewbs.  

Oh well, whatevs. Life sucks anyway.

Day 3

Read Allen Carr's book, and decided I wanted to fully quit. I'm 24 smoked a half pack to a pack a day for 5 years? This is my first attempt at a quit and hopefully I can do it on my first go. I figure it's only going to get harder. 

It is definitely difficult but I don't question I will be able to go without smoking. My biggest 2 fears are

1) Getting wasted and not smoking

2) the posts of people who went 5 years and relapsed, really hoping this won't be a life long battle. 

Cheers

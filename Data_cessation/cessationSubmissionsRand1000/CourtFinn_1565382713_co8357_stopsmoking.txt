100 days today👱‍♀️

I had a procedure done today and went under anesthesia and it was so nice to see my oxygen saturation level at 💯 % BP at 116/68 and proud to answer NO to “ Do you smoke?”😊💪
If I can do it after 20 years of smoking and still hang out with all my friends that smoke you can too- seriously! It hasn’t been easy but you can do it! Oh also scheduled mine and hubby’s physical for Monday!

Behind the Smoke was me.

I had been a smoker for the last 30 years.  Started at 13 and just never stopped.   At times it was a pack a day and in the last 10 years it was about a half a pack per day.  I was a secret smoker, waiting until after work to smoke my evenings away in secret from the public.  With this secret held shame. Hiding something from peers, friends and family members.  So much hiding behind a cloud of deadly smoke.  I would have a hard time making eye contact at times due to my shame of my double life.  What makes it worse is I work with children and would contemplate my addiction to nicotine as a hypocrite role model.  I hated how it made me feel emotionally, physically, mentally.  The reality of my addiction came to light during the second, third and fourth days of my quit week.  It was hard, those cravings, the withdrawal, even with stage ll patches.  The yearning to inhale toxic smoke was painfully difficult to resist.  But I did.  Today is 3 weeks and one day, of being a non smoker and it feels fabulous.  I am free.  I still get the evening crave, where I really want one, but more of me doesn't.  Because it's hold doesn't cage me any more.  My confidence is growing and I feel authentic and transparent in who I am.  Freedom is a beautiful gift and I will never allow it go be taken away by the death sticks ever again.  The best advice I was given by a girlfriend who said "Do whatever you have to to quit.  Just don't smoke.  Patch, gun , pills.  Whatever you need , just no cigerattes."  Used the patch for five days and stopped.  That's what worked for me.  Smoke free app. this community, u tube stories of people quitting were all helpful too.  I am a non smoker!!!  I am so happy!  I did it!

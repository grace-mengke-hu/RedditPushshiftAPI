Passed a heavy checkpoint last night

I was enjoying cocktails with a couple friends last night at my house. One of the friends who I hadn't seen in a while decides to step outside to smoke, and the other friend follows. Rather than just sit on the couch and wait for them I step outside too. We're all standing there talking for about a minute and he's smoking, then he looks at me and says "Oh yeah, you smoke, right? Want one?" as he holds the pack up to my face. This was my first time being around a smoking friend while drinking, and I'm about 4 drinks in at this pointâ€¦ I hesitated, then said "No thanks, I quit at the beginning of the year." and we just continued on with our conversation like normal. It was hard, but I fucking did it.

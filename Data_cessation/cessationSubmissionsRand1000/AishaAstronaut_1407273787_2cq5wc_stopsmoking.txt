I'm a smug non-smoker

I never wanted to be one of those smug non smokers, but I am. I feel sorry for smokers still stuck in the trap. I feel so free and so good it's hard to believe I was hooked only 2 weeks ago.
My mum insists she's going to quit and every time she goes out for a fag, I feel so sad for her and kind of angry too. She's used the Allen carr method before and quit for 8 years. It took he some serious work to end up a smoker again but she's there.
She's bought the book again and says she'll watch the video I told her about but she still hasnt and she told me to read the book first. She's clearly putting it off :( I want to help but you can't make someone quit. They won't do it until it's their idea, I know that from my own experience :/
This was meant to be a positive post about
My progress and I digressed. So if you guys have any advice on that, that'd be awesome.
On a happier note, I went to the corner shop I used to buy from today and the guy who runs it and I always have a chat. Today he told me my mum told him I'd quit. That was nice, I felt proud :)

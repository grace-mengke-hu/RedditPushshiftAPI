What’s with all the smoking in the movies?

Was watching a film last night and noticed that the characters light up every other scene. I used go for a smoke whenever I saw someone with a cigarette on TV, like yeah I feel you, let me take a moment and think about things with you (the character) while I choke myself with nasty chemicals for 5 minutes straight.

But this time, I was like, hey, what the fuck, you don’t need to smoke all the time. Why is she smoking? Her dad too? And that chick? What’s the problem with y’all?

Yeah it was some moody drama but it felt like they are portraying smoking as a coping mechanism. As something people do when they feel blue. This association keeps so many people addicted. One of my go-to excuses was that I smoke when I’m stressed. And now I realise that smoking actually does jack shit to stress. It’s still there, but you pumped some mucus to your lungs and are somehow expected to feel better? That’s a steaming pile of shite, people.

I’m at day 28 now, and feel good. No cravings, no fighting. Life is better without a cigarette. Not another puff!

P.S. I don’t like the “no matter what” part, because that still assumes some sort of resistance you have to perform to keep yourself from smoking. Instead, get rid of smoker’s mindset first and it will be so easy to stay off!

P.P.S. You absolutely rock being on this sub and reading this, and other people’s posts! That alone is a good progress, and I congratulate you on how far you’ve come! And thanks to posters for the great support you provide by sharing your experience in this community!

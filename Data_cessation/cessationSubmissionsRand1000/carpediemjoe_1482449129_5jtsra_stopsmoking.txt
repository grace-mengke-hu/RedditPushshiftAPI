Something to ponder.

A good analogy for cigarettes is asbestos. In the 50s they were putting asbestos in everything and they thought it was a miracle element. Turns out it kills you and gives you cancer. If you met someone today who said "yea I'm into using asbestos in my kitchen and stuff. I know it's not healthy but I really like it." You would think they are a freaking moron. But isn't that how we rationalize smoking?

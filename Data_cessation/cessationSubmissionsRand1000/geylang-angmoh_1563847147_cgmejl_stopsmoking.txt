And just like that, I kept killing myself...

The morning was pretty smooth, I had my shake and a nice breakfast put together by my missy, and went to work. I don’t take public transport anymore because it takes the same amount of time if I just walk there, around 30 minutes. I go through my day, waiting for lunch first, then for the end of the day.

Finally, the clock is at 6 and I can leave the office. I walk all the way home. She’s not there yet, so I change, and get back at it. It’s been a long and stressful day and I need my fix, I need to blow off some steam. I’m back to killing myself. I stretch a little, then put my lungs and muscles to a challenge. The routine changes depending on how tired I am and what’s available. It hurts just the way I like it, so I keep grinding.

It feels so good, there’s nothing like pushing through double your usual sets. Sometimes I just crush on my bed after shower until the next morning. And it keeps me well far enough from smoking. With a fag in my mouth I wouldn’t be able to do half of what I can do now, even though I started working out before I quit smoking. I just realised that nicotine is not needed to live a life.

Stay hydrated people! Not another puff!

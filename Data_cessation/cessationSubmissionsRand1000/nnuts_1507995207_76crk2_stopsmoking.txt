Doesn't even seem possible - that's a star in my flair!

So apparently it's been a month since I had a cigarette.  It feels unreal!  I've quit before, but I'm not entirely sure that I even went a month my last successful quit - I'd occasionally bum one from time to time when out drinking.  This time, not a puff.

I used a vape to stop this time - started at 12mg and I'm already down to 6mg.  I bought a whole setup and a few hundred mL of juice, I just bought a kit to mix my own juices, and the app STILL says I've saved money over smoking!   I've got enough stuff to make several months worth of juice, and the kit came with enough nicotine that I shouldn't ever have to buy another bottle of that!  

At what point do I get to start thinking of myself as a nonsmoker, rather than a smoker who is quitting?  I know I'm not past the point of relapsing - I've been there before - but this time really feels different.  I'm proud and am certain that I'll never, ever have another cigarette.   Feels great!

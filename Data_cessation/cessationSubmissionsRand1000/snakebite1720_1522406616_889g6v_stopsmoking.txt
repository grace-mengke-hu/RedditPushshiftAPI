I just reset my quit date

I stoped on 15th March but for some reason i ended up smoking 1 odd cancer stick on 26th March after i finished reading "Easy way to qui smoking by Allen Carr". I don't know why i did that probably i wanted to feel how bad it feels to smoke it but since then its like i don't need them anymore and feeling good about it. I AM A NON-SMOKER now :) 

So thought to reset the date to be fair with myself.

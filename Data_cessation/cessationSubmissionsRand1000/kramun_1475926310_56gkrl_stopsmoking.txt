Day 7 without nicotine, almost relapsed last night, saved by 0mg elecronic cigarette.

I was doing really well in the first days. Then i went out in a pub and everyone was smoking (not me). Nicotine entered my system of course, which resulted in huge cravings after about 24 hours. Luckily i didnt give in but vaped some 0mg nicotine e-juice. It really helped me. If i vape that, I dont have cravings anymore, even though it has no nicotine. Anyone else who uses this trick?

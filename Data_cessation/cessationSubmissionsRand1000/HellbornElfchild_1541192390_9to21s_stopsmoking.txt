Just popping in to say that you got this

Hello! I guess I'm 2600+ Days since smoking, just wanted to say that you got this! After a point not too far from now you'll never even consider a cigarette. Its only as hard as you make it!

Also a plug for The Easy Way to Stop Smoking by Alan Carr! I read that book, and never touched a cigarette since. Simple as that. It saved my life!

Best of Luck!

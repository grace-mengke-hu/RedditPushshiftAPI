Not smoking at bedtime tonight!

Usually I sneak down for a few half cigarettes after Boyfriend falls asleep...but not tonight!

I've got one of those mini Nicorette mints going now. 

I'm getting there, guys!  

I started this quit by fantasizing how I would post to this sub once successful. The post title will be "The stop smoking app that's already on your phone".  Being excited about posting and noticing all the little items that will go into the post along the way has been very motivating. 

I'm not there yet, but I will be soon. All thanks to you!

Breakfast smoke and bedtime smoke have been the hardest to give up...when I make it tonight, tomorrow morning could be my first smoke free morning!

Anyway, just posting to say hi because you all are so wonderful and supportive. Hope you are having a fresh-air evening as well!

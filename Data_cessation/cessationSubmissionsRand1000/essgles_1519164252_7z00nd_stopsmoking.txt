Back again...

Just started another quit as of 10pm GMT. 

A quit history:

#1 - 2 years of only (occasionally) smoking socially after 8 years of solid smoking. I know now this meant constant withdrawal. 

#2 - A couple of months full time smoking. Quit for two months. 

#3 - Third time is meant to be lucky, right? Just screwed up my two month quit this weekend. 

I've excluded many mini quits from this list. Far too familiar with the hell of withdrawal and can say that my last few cigarettes have been awful and simply a testament to nicotine addiction.

Support would be greatly appreciated, and words of advice. Really want this one to stick as ten years of smoking is too long!

5 Days

I posted a couple weeks ago about trying to quit. I've been a smoker for 7 years now. I managed to stop for 7 months the year I started smoking. After a really bad break up, I picked up the habit again. Ranging anywhere from 1-2 packs a day. At a certain point, I was really unstable financially. I chose cigarettes over food. I was down to 155lbs. Got a (somewhat) better job and I've been able to get up to 220lb between eating and the gym. Quit cigarettes and started smoking black and milds just to save a couple bucks. I've been going a day or two here and there without a smoke, but I'm ready to shed some of this fat and get chiseled. My point is that I'm on day 5 of no tobacco or vapor products. I'm on the patches and I'm going to see the 10 week program through.  Thank you to everyone on here being supportive and open.  I want to better my life and I applaud you all for doing the same.

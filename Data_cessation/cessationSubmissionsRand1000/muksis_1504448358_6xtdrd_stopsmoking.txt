Day 31, it's all good

Background: I smoked a pack/day for 22 years. Now 35.

I've been smoke free for a month today. It has been surprisingly easy so far. I've been hanging out with friends who smoke, I've been drunk around smokers, I've been bored, I've been sad... I still carry nicotine gum with me for genuine emergencies but haven't really wanted/needed it for the past week. 

I know there will be some tough times ahead still but so far I'm pleased with the progress I've made. Money isn't my #1 reason for quitting (my health is) but even so, I've set up a new bank account for the money saved and the balance is already â‚¬200. It's funny (well not really) to think that the old me would've set that amount on fire every month.

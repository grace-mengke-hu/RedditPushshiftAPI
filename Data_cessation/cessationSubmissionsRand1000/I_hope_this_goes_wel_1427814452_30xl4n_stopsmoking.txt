Getting tired of these smoking nightmares

The last three nights in a row have been extremely surreal dreams of me either holding a cigarette thinking about lighting it or me actually caving in and smoking it. Yeah it's a good feeling when I finally realize it was just a dream but it usually takes me a good 3 minutes to actually realize it...  Any-who... Another amazing day being a non-smoker. I smell good today.

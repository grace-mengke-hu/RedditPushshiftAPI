Made it through day one!

Decided that today would be the day I quit. I had my last cigarette on the drive home from work yesterday, so I'm already over 24 hours in with no smoking. To keep my mind off not smoking today, I gave my car a good cleaning, which was well needed as there was (what I assume) tiny bits of ash all over the place. Now I'm going to head out to McDonalds to get a milkshake to congratulate myself with!

Here's to hopefully sticking with it this time!

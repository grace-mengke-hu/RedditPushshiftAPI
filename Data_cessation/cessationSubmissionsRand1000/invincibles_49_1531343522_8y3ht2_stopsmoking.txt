Do landmark days result in an uptick in anxiety?

I think the the answer to this is yes as I feel it and I have a read a lot of people posting about it but it is helpful for me to type it out. I am nicotine free for 32 days now and for the past couple of days I have one intense craving in the evening. Also, the foreboding which I thought had gone has kind of returned. Even though I am stronger as a non smoker now than compared to the first week I believe that trying to get to 30 days, a month etc just fucks up the method. 

So, even though I am asking here I would like to advice everybody that getting to a month etc is crap. It's just getting through the first 3 days, (the physical withdrawal), post that it's getting through one craving at a time. You might go a month without a craving if you manage to avoid the triggers. I also believe that we are unaware of a lot of triggers and therefore cannot plan for them. For example, I went into a frenzyb day  yesterday because the office space was hotter than usual. I did not know that this was a trigger until I lost complete focus. This was day 31 and I for depressed that the feeling is still there. But then I started reading and remembered this part where they say that it's the subconscious mind that craves cigarette and it craves it only because it was used to getting nicotine in such a situation. So, we need to retrain it by doing the same activity without the smoking. So, one craving at a time and you are good to go after the physical withdrawal.

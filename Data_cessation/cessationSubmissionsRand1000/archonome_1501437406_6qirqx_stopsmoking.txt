Past 3 days. Disoriented and "blue feeling". I thought the physical withdrawal ends after 72 hours??

Hey guys.

I'm on day 5. I am ok with the urges because I am sick of the way I am feeling right now.

What confuses me is that whyquit.com and alot of online ressources mention that physical withdrawal only lasts 72 hours and it gets better.

I don't get it I'm on day 5 and I am actually feeling MORE disoriented and trouble concentrating than 
on those 72 hours.

Is this normal? I'm confused. Please share your experiences if you felt like me past 72 hours(help me be inspired lol).

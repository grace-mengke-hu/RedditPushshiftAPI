3 years quit today!!

As of 1:30 in the morning (between the 25th and 26th), I've been a former smoker for three whole years now! It is weird to think sometimes that I smoked for 10.5 years. Now I am a runner, I run with my dog, I am in the graduate program of my dreams and don't have to worry about how I smell or if my teeth and hands are tar stained when I meet professionals with whom I have to work, and I'm overall so much more relaxed! If anyone had told me three years ago that having quit would be this good (especially in the throes of those withdrawals) I would not have believed you.

To everyone who is still at the beginning, don't give up on yourselves! To everyone one, two, or more years in, keep up the good work, and be kind to yourselves!

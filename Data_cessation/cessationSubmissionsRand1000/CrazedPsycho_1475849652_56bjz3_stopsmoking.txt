Two weeks and I feel awesome!

I do still have cravings from time to time, but they don't make me sweat anymore! Also, not only did dreams of having a smoke disappear, I also recently dreamt that someone I know wanted to start smoking and I vehemently held against it and told him what I had experienced. 

So, thank you r/stopsmoking for your support, for telling me about the app "QuitNow" which is a huge motivator on its own, and for teaching me to never let my guard down, as quitting is a lifetime battle that is never really over. I love you guys! 

Tl; dr: Doin' better, thank y'all for all the support.

1 week in, still a challenge

Today marks one week without a cigarette. It's been rough, even with my e-cigarette. Yesterday was a real test for me. I'm on the road a lot for work, and normally I chainsmoke on long drives. Hell, I can't get in my car without instantly lighting up, but yesterday, I went on a road trip, and didn't smoke a single cigarette. I almost broke down and bought a pack every time I stopped but I managed to get through it with my e-cig and a pack of gum.

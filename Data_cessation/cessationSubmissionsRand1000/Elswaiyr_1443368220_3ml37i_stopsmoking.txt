I'm resetting my badge.

Not just because I had one cigarette and found it absolutely unfulfilling, but I'm going off the nicotine in whole. I've been vaping for 39 days, and haven't had all the gains I want. I see the money I've "saved" and know I've just spent the same on my quitting aid. I believe I am ready. I'll have it there as as fall back if I need it, but I want to untie myself from that dependence as well.

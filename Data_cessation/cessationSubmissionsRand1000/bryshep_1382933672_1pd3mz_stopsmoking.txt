1 week and drinking tomorrow

Using the cold turkey method I've been nicotine free for 1 week now. I still get cravings, but can shake them off and they only last a few minutes.  Tomorrow however my friend is coming into town and we will be drinking.  There is no way that I am going to turn down a chance to hang with my friend, so that leaves us out on the patio enjoying the last good day of summer with lots of alcohol in hand.  Does anyone have suggestions on how to help curb the cravings?  I heard drinking something you don't usually drink is one idea.  Anyone have any others ideas?

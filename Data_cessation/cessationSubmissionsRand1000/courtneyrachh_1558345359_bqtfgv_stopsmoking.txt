first race being a nonsmoker

I’ve been competing in races of various lengths for the last two years, on top of being a coach for a girls running team. 

I’ve always felt so ashamed and like such a bad role model for smoking on my way and after. And of course, the races were extremely hard on my body. 

I am so excited to say, after a week of being nonsmoker, I ran alongside my group of girls at their 5k and finally felt like a good role model. 

Thank you to this sub and your posts for always encouraging me!!!

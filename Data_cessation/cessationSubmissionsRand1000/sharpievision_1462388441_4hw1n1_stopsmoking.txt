Starting again. I think this might be the time that is for real.

I had quit for over a month then caved and started smoking again for a few days. I decided I couldn't live with the addiction as comfortably as I thought and am determined to quit again. I've tried a few times and the last time was the longest. I'm at 48 hours now and feel pretty good. No question, just was having a craving and decided to post here instead of going to buy cigarettes. Thanks everybody.

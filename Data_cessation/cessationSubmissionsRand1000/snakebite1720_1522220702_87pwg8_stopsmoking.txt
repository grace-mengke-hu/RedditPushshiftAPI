Don't be your own MURDERER!!!

Guys,

Would like to share this with you because i seriously feel most of the people need this. I had my last 'Cancer Stick' on 14th March 2018 and after that i strongly made up my mind to quit the same either using NRT or will power etc. I used nicotine gums for a week and then stoped nicotine completely on 7th day and was craving hard for the same on day 10th, 11 etc.

And then this happened: I started reading "Easy way to stop smoking by allen carr".

This was it. I never had a craving ever since (though its only 2 days) but i know in my head that am done using these "Cancer Sticks". Earlier i used to feel like i was sacrificing something but now its all about how happy &amp; energetic i am getting with each passing moment. 

I strongly recommend everyone to read it completely and think about it. Do you will fully want to be your own MURDERER??

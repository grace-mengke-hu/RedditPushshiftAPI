Stop being afraid.

Hey guys, I posted a while back and I quit for 9 days. I'm 21 and I've been smoking for 4 years. I am having a hard time finding the courage and strength to quit. However after long consideration and help from this subreddit I know that there is no "good" time to quit. The time is now and I encourage everyone who wants to quit but never put their foot forward to do so. Today starts the rest of my life. Wish me luck.

Day 16

Alright I may or may not be making progress.  This morning upon exiting the lobby at work I did not have the overwhelming urge to have a city.  I actually did not even think about cigarettes let alone having a cigarette until I was I. My LYFT home.  Then again maybe exhaustion played into this. Is there a point where your to exhausted to think about cigarettes if that's the case maybe I just need to stay on a constant level of exhaustion. Wishing everyone a good smoke free day.

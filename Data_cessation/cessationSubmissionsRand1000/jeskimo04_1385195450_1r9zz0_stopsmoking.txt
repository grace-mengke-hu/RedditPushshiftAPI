I almost did it.

Me and my girlfriend got into a pretty rough argument today. On top of that I was on my way home with a 5 hour drive, and my e-cig wasnt working for the first 2. I almost bought a pack. I almost went back to it. GODDAMNIT I WAS SO CLOSE!

Honestly I hated every second of pulling up to the gas station. I knew exactly what I wanted. I didn't have a lighter so I'd have to buy one of those too. I remembered that drive, the same drive I've done hundreds of times before to get my fix, to make sure I would make it through the night.

But I didn't.

I didn't buy a pack of smokes tonight, I didn't fucking give up!

I still hate everything right now, but I'm not smoking so it's not so bad I guess.

Tried to quit so many times, I want this to be my last pack

It's not my first time posting on this sub. In fact, I've been here for help twice before. I've lost track of the number of times I quit because I'll start up again a few days after. I need help. I seriously do. With a family history of smoking and dying of cancer, I know it's only a matter of time before I reap what I sow, and that scares me. I bought a pack last night, and have 16 cigs left. I really want to quit, but the cravings drive me nuts. How can I do it? How can I beat this once and for all? Please help me.

2 years. I just wanted to thank all of you guys.

This subreddit and the wonderful Mr. Allen Carr helped me to get to this point. Three years ago I was not only convinced, I *knew* I was going to smoke until I die. Today I know I will never smoke anything ever again. Quitting was probably the greatest decission I ever made.

Thank you all for sharing your stories and your advice. You made this journey so much easier.

And if I can do it, you can too. It gets easier every day!

From the bottom of my heart, thank you!

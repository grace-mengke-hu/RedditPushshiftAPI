It's been 43 days... I'm sleeping more, my resting heart rate is lower, and I've gained about 20 lbs but most seems like water weight. When does the energy come back?

I haven't had cravings or desires to start up again. Honestly, I don't mind gaining a few pounds now if it means I'll be healthier down the road. I can lose the weight when my metabolism balances out later. I'm just wondering just how long does that take? My guess is I have another month and a half?? Any females care to chime in as well? I'm guessing quitting smoking is different not just for each individual, but also effects genders differently.

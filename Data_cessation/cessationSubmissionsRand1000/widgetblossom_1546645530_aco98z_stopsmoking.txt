If I start smoking again after quitting this time, somebody please shoot me.

Day 1 without the lozenges. I've got a little bit of a withdrawal headache. 

I should have known better. I keep quitting. I keep starting again. Everytime I swear I am not putting myself through this again. 

I'm serious. Shoot me if I start again. Put me out of my misery.

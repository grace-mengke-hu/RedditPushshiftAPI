"It's gotta be done, doesn't it?"

I visited Ireland in 2014, and this is what one of the Irishmen said to me when he passed me on the street as I was smoking (sidenote: I love the Irish, SO friendly!) I was outside my hotel burning one, he greeted me, and in his awesome accent, said "It's gotta be done, doesn't it?"

Today is Day 6 of my quit, and I now realize just how true what he said was (at the time, I just laughed in agreement with him). But that's one of the main reasons I'm so tired of this addiction...it DOES "gotta be done!" In the early days of my smoking career, I fooled myself into thinking I was in control of this addiction (which I thought was mere habit back then). It wasn't until I first tried stopping and the addiction fought me (literally, FOUGHT me) that I realized the opposite is true...the addiction controls me, not the other way around.

I'm tired of being controlled. I'm tired of continuously failing and giving into this weed wrapped in paper. Out of the billions of cigs I've smoked in my life, I only remember 2 (well, 3 if you count the one in Ireland): the first cig, and the first time I felt the compulsion to go buy more. It was probably 2 decades ago (yes, I'm old), I was driving, opened my pack, saw there was only 1 left, and a sense of panic came over me. "Why do I feel this way?" I asked myself, then battled with the idea of buying more which, of course, I did.

Today is Day 6 of my quit, and so far so good. I actually toked on a vape a couple times yesterday, cause I was struggling pretty hard (like, I was begging God to send a meteor crashing towards Earth just to justify going to the store the buy a pack...He didn't send one). But yeah, I'm just tired of the control. I want to be in control again.

Have a great day folks, and stay smober!

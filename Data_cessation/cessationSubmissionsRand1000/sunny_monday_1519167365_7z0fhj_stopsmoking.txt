Day 50 and more withdrawals

Quit Jan1 after 30 years, pack a day. Switched to vaping. Started at 6mg strength. Had horrible withdrawal symptoms the first 2+ weeks. I mean... everyday I googled a new symptom and it seemed I was experiencing every bizarro symptom possible.

Downgraded this weekend to 3mg juice. And... Im going through a second round of withdrawals. Im twitching. My skin and scalp are covered in zits. I cannot concentrate at work. I feel disgusting.

Im REALLY frustrated, but I dont actually want a cigarette right now. Instead, I really want a shower.

Made it 90 days!!!!!

I don't really have much to say. Just really excited I made it this far. Especially considering everything in my life working against me. My husband smokes, as does 95% of my family, really bad (whatever is a step below chronic) back pain, oh and I happen to work in a tobacco store, one of the only places in my state you can smoke in. Everyone has excuses. It's a matter of ignoring them, and putting things into perspective!! If I can do it, so can you!

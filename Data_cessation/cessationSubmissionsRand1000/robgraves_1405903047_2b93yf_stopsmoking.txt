Rapidly approaching the one year mark.

I quit August 8th, 2013, and now less than 3 weeks until my one year anniversary of being smoke and nicotine free, I feel like I can breath and that I've broken free of something and completed a task that for years I had deemed "impossible".  A person who never gives up, never fails.

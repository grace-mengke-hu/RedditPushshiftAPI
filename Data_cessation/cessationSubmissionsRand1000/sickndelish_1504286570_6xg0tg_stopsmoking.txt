Short list of benefits - current and future

So, I just thought I'd type out some of the benefits I've noticed already and others I'm anticipating. Please add your own in the comments!

My confidence is up. 

My lungs don't hurt in the morning. 

I wake up earlier with more energy and less grogginess. 

I don't stink. 

I'm saving money. 

I feel tough. 

I can sit inside and study without smoke breaks. 

I can go to bars that don't have smoking sections/patios. 

I can sit through a movie without needing a cigarette. 

I'm going to the gym again. 

My boners are harder. 

I'm renting a car this weekend and don't have to worry about smoking in it. 

I'm staying at an AirBnB this weekend and don't have to worry about the hosts judging me for smoking. 

I'm flying a lot in the next few months and don't have to worry about trying to smoke as much as possible before the flight, being miserable for hours, and racing out of the airport to smoke.  

I'm going to grad school next year and won't have to worry about craving in long classes or being judged by classmates. 

These are just a few benefits, but they're so fucking powerful! Let's hear yours!

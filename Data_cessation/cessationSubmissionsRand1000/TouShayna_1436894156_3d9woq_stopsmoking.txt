5 months! But concerned....

I am beyond elated that I have reached 5 months cigarette-free! Like many, I have gained some weight in my quit... But it's concerning me now. I have battled an eating disorder for almost as long as was a smoker. I used to substitute smoking for meals and had damned near trained my brain to think hunger pains were cigarette cravings. I have had a pretty good hold on my ED for the past 2 years and was able to maintain a healthy weight without losing. When I first quit smoking I tried to exercise when I got cravings. That started to get obsessive about it again and it scared me... I don't want to go back to being sick and frail. I backed off of the neurotic exercising and just tried to feel my cravings for what they were and work through them. It was working for a while.... But now I'm 20 pounds heavier and freaking out. It's like I now feel a craving and my brain processes it as hunger, so I eat... Then I feel disgusted with myself and depressed which makes we want to smoke... It's like my addictions and obsessions are at war with each other AND me.

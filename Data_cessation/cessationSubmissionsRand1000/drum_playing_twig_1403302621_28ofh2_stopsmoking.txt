Former smokers: How do you deal with difficult times or tragedies in life? How do you stop yourselves from turning to cigarettes when life gets really rough?

Everybody goes through hardships in their life. People get dumped, they break their legs, the might lose a loved one in an accident, get fired etc. Everybody goes through some really hard stuff at some point in their lives.

My question is: How do you NOT go back to smoking if some unexpected tragedy would occur in your life and you KNOW that a cigarette would calm your nerves? I'm only 3 weeks in, but I know that if something bad would've happen to me right now, I could easily fall off the wagon and start smoking again.

It feels like you matter how long you've been smoke free, and even if you dislike it, you will NEVER forget the calming, relaxing effect it actually had on you when you were stressed out.

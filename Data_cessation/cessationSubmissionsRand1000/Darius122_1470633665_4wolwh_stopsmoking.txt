It's been a while.. but my brains started to trick me .

Hey guys.. so as I said It's been a while since i was spending my time here on Reddit. Smoking thoughts were left me for a while , but now their back and brings me memmories of the "good old times" with my friends , BBQ outside. It tries to tell me how smoking was nice and maybe make me sad that this never will happen again. I just cant beleave how strong and what big impact cigaretes has on humans, thats good that this will not trick me again after many attempts to quit. Good luck all , don't let these stupid memmories to trick ya !

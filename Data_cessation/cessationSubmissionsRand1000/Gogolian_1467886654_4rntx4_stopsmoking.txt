So me and my fiance found half a pack of cigarettes today...

She: Wow I think it's from the time i smoked in sweden. Look It's even got sweedish warnings on it.

Me: Yeah, I remember that, I used to smoke as well at that time.

S: We could keep it as a token.

M: I don't know. Let's not have it in the house. It took us both a lot to stop smoking.

S: Ok, I'll give it to one of my co-workers then.

M: Let's get rid of it instead.

S: What? Why? Somebody could use it.

M: Yeah, but... you know... Let's not give anybody free cigarettes now, that we're against it... You know what i have in mind.

S: You're right *throws pack in garbage bag*

I took out the pack, took the cigarettes out, broke each of them and put them in garbage can again.

Oh, and also checking my badge :)

Good day to you all non smokers :)

Today was gut wrenching hard but necessary.

I have an 18 year old daughter who is sick. She's been sick for years, but has gotten worse over the past 2 years. Last year at this time, she had a feeding tube. Her body couldn't tolerate food at all. Then she had the feeding tube removed and did well. Now she has a heart monitor, wears out easily, lots of chest pain, and cannot climb stairs. She's 18. Today was rough for her. And I got pissed. 

First, I was pissed because I wanted a cigarette. My 18 year old daughter sometimes fights to breathe, to have energy to climb stairs and I want the one thing that does nothing but clogs my lungs. She cannot help being sick and I'm stupid enough to be healthy but crave something that will make me sick. So I went running instead. And cried. And ran. And cried. But I didn't smoke. 

Then I was ashamed. We were at her cardiologist appointment right before Christmas. Standard question: Does anyone in the house smoke? She said "Not anymore" since she no longer lives in the home. But he still looked at me like "Are you kidding?" '

I wanted to smoke so bad today. Because whenever she was sick, I would have a cigarette. And today, it hit me how stupid it was. How utterly, completely stupid and selfish. So I didn't have one. 

She came to visit tonight. She curled up on the couch next to me, head on my lap. She told me she's proud of me. I told her we could run a 5K together. She said nothing. She probably cannot. But I'm finally making the type of choices that honor my health as well as honor her. I'll run my next race for her. 

I don't even know if this is the place for this. Today was hard. My daughter is sick. I want to smoke but didn't. I should be proud. I kind of am. But today, I'm also incredibly sad and realize it since I am not using anything to numb the pain.

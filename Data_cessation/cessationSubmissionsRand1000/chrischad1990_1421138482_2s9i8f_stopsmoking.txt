my unborn baby girl is my motivation!!!

my partner is expecting our first child and as soon as I found out I decided to quit the fags after 10 years of smoking 15-25 a day. 

I am now on day 12 and can honestly say it has been an emotional rollercoaster!! however I have saved Â£80.00 so far and put this into an account for my little girl, this keeps me motivated and gives me something to hold on to, I suggest you try this too.... are you in the same situation as me and expecting a child? or is there something you have wanted to purchase for sometime but never been able to afford it or even justify paying for it ? or even you would like a weekend away? each penny you save can contribute to the sweeter things in life keep strong set your mind on something and keep going!! we are in this fight together :)

365 Happy Dance!!!!

Never thought I would make it. I was a slave to cigarettes and nicotine for 40 years. Up to 2 packs a day at one time. Attempted to quit 100's of times, never made it more than 8 weeks. 

This time I owe my success to an awesome author and his book of truth. Mr. Allan Carr and "The Easy Way To Stop Smoking" Once I knew the truth about smoking, nicotine addiction, the lies I was believing about why I smoked, it was just impossible to continue to smoke. The truth set me free.

Today I am no longer a slave to nicotine addiction. Saved over $4000 so far and didn't smoke 10,950 cigarettes. That's 547.5 packs of death I did not put into this body. And the best part is, IT WAS EASY!!
Withdrawal and cravings that were so mild, I didn't even notice then. When I finished the book, it felt like I turned off the smoking switch. 

Can't recommend this book enough. Why struggle, why feel shitty, why be angry, why be miserable. Read the book. Quitting can be as easy as we believe it can be. And for me (this time) it was easy. 

Thanks /r/stopsmoking and Mr. Carr. I AM A NON-SMOKER!!!!

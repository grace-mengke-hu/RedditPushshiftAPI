Redditors who are on nicotine replacement products: do you have insomnias ?

Hey everyone, after spending one month nicotine free, I decided two weeks ago to start chewing nicotine gum, to see if it helped with my severe insomnias (1h of sleep per night). It did help to some extent but i still have insomnias. Considering that I m at a crossroads in my life, that is, some heavy problems to deal with, i was wondering if those insomnias were mostly the product of me having stopped smoking or mostly the product of my psychological difficulties...hence the question, redditors on nicotine, do you sleep like you used to when you smoked?

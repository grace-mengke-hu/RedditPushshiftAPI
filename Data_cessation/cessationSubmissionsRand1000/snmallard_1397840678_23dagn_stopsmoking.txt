Smoke free for exactly three weeks today.

The hardest part of not smoking is that all of my roommates smoke and a lot of people at work. I've been using the patch (don't even comment saying not to use it, already been using it for three weeks and not looking to hear shit about it). But I completely forgot to put it on yesterday and I was out from 10:30am-12:30am. And didn't put it on again until this morning before I left for work. I got through yesterday, it's just so hard not to smoke when I'm bored at work, having some wine, and after I eat a meal. I've finally gotten out of the habit of lighting a cigarette as soon as I get in my car and while in traffic.


I'm happy that I'm able to say I'm 3 weeks smoke free and that I will never have a cigarette again but it's also kind of scary and sad that I will never "enjoy" a cigarette again.

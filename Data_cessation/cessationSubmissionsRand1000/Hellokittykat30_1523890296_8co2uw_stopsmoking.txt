Im 15 days in and feeling like shit. The first week was ok, I was using the patch so I had that to fall back on, but this past week has been hell. I've had this constant headache that I couldn't get rid of to save my life, I was super irritable, anxious and so freaking tired, but as soon as I lay down it's like hellooooo insomnia.

It's been a week of this bs. Weirdly, I wasn't craving a cigarette at all even tho I almost smoked bc I thought I was going thru some horrible withdrawal (I've quit before and it's never been this bad) and just wanted the headache to go away.

This morning I woke up at 4. I had like 3 hrs sleep and I was wide awake. So I said fuck it and got up and made some coffee. Browsed Reddit, did dishes whatever. Around 7 I layed back down in bed to watch Netflix and fell asleep. On and off til 10. My daughter was up by this time and watching TV super loud so I got up to tend to her. Dragged myself into the kitchen to get some leftover coffee then decided to just make a new pot. Pulled out the container and stared at it with glazed eyes. And then I see it. The little green letters that say D E C A F. Decaf. Deecccccaaafffff wtf? Thank you Jeebus it's not some worm in my brain from that pork chop I ate 2 weeks ago. I accidently quit caffeine while quitting smoking. I have never felt more miserable. I also feel pretty bad ass since I didn't break down and smoke (tho I considered it). Anyways, that's my story. Happy Monday everyone!

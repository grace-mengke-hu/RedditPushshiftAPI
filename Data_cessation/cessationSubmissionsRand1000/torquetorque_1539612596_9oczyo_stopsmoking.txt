Many months since I quit but I’m getting cravings: first airplane trip since becoming a non-smoker!

They say that you can expect random cravings for a solid year or so after you quit because it takes that long for most if not all of the “firsts” to happen as a non-smoker. They are not lying! I’m waiting for my first flight since becoming a non-smoker, and wouldn’t you know I’m craving cigarettes! I haven’t smoked a single puff since February 13. 


Obviously I will not be smoking lol, I’m just annoyed because I was so excited to be going on my first plane trip without needing a cigarette! Haha, oh well, next time I guess :) I guess at least this time I can just take a few deep breaths and be over it. Someday I will hopefully be able to just fly and not even think about it :)

Second hand smoke

Does anyone else feel guilty for standing just a little too close to someone smoking a cigarette. I was at work today and one of my coworkers followed me outside to my car and started smoking. I realized that I was taking in a lot more of their second hand smoke than I was comfortable with and then moved away. 
It’s been bugging me all day. I feel like I’ve basically smoked a cigarette vicariously through them...
I don’t know am I overreacting?

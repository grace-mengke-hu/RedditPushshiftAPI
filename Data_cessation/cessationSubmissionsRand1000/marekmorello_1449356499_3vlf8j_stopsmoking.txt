My quitting buddy caved in.

(Sorry for my bad english, I'm no native speaker)

Hey guys, a week ago my quitting buddy and me were at a wine tasting together. When it was over we still sat at the table and had another glass. After a while he stood up, looked at me and said: "Hey man, I have to confess something. I started smoking again." We then proceeded to go outside so he could have a cigarette. My last real bad craving is pretty long ago, but when I saw him smoking I had the urge to smoke like I was in my first week. I didn't cave in but I still wanted to tell you guys about this experience. I read Allen Carr's book to quit, and was reminded that he strictly recommend to quit alone because of this kind of hazard. I was reminded that quitting is no team sport. 

Tl;dr: My quitting buddy started smoking again. Bad cravings ensured.

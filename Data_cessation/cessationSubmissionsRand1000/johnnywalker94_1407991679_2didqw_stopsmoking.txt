I never thought this would happen, but I now hate the smell of cigarette smoke now. Do you guys hate the smell of cigarette smoke after quitting? (Day 3)

Now that I am going past 74 hours of not smoking, I am starting to hate being around smoke now. I was with my good friend and he was smoking all night. For some reason I really hated the smell of smoke and even gave me a headache just smelling it. Smoke has never bothered even as a child when my parents smoked, but for some reason it really bothered me today. I no longer want to buy a pack at all and just want to continue vaping. Im doing great at the moment and so proud I have gone 3 days! The best I have done yet and I cannot wait to reach a week of not smoking. I think that I am on the right track and hope to post on day seven of being a non-smoker. I do have one question though, do you guys get bothered by the smell of smoke after a long time being a non-smoker?

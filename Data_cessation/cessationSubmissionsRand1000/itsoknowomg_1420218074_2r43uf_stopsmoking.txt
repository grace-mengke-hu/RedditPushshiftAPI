i dont know, just venting out prolly

i feel sad, paranoid, anxious, i dont know. 


Its been 18 days i broke up, i feel like it will help me when ill get it back, that everything will be cool again when ill have it, everything will be easier and prettier... So sad, but true.... i know i shouldnt, inner voice tells me to suck it up and move on.


more or less this is how i feel, and im not sure if its cause i miss nikotine or if i miss the girl i broke up with one month ago.


or if nikotine winthdrawal increases, multiplies feelings of sadness when i miss her... im confused, she was really nice girl and we broke up cause she suddenly stopped liking me.

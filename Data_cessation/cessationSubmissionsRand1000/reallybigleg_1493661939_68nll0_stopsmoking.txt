Day 13 - worried about continued loss of appetite

This is probably nothing and may even sound like a non-problem to some but I have still not regained my appetite since quitting smoking. 

Has anyone else experience loss of appetite after quitting smoking? I realise it's usually the opposite - usually people are more hungry.

I'm not sure I have experienced actual hunger in the last two weeks. I've been eating at mealtimes and trying to eat the same amount but I'm not enjoying the food and I can't tell when I'm full. I stop eating when I start feeling sick.

It's just an odd feeling - like my body has stopped telling me when I need food and when I've had enough.

I also haven't experienced constipation. Quite the opposite, I've had a bit of a runny tummy.

I know it's probably nothing to worry about but it's actually making me feel a bit miserable and I'm quite worried about losing weight as I am already slim and don't want to be slimmer! So far, the fact I fit into a dress this morning that I haven't fit into for years suggests I might have dropped a few pounds.

Have others had the same symptom and did it take long to regain the appetite and go back to normal? Perhaps it's just down to an increase in anxiety?

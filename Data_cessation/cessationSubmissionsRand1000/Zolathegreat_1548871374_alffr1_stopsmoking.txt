I'm going trough hardest times.

I've been thinking about smoking a lot lately. I dono why I want to smoke so badly, but I guess it's due to loneliness and boredom. I tried to quit many times before and failed at this point of time. I hope it will not happen this time. This is a pivotal point for me. If I succeed I know I will not take a puff for the rest of my life. But it's hard. When I am at my job I usually do not think about smoking, but when I come home I think a lot about it. I tried many things to kill this boredom. I tried reading, going to gym, eating... Somehow thoughts about smoking always sneak upon me. I don't know what to do. I don't think I can take it any longer.

Something to do with the money saved.

Just before I made the move to quit smoking I decided to start losing weight. I say lose weight but I really just mean lose some fat and gain some muscle. I’m not necessarily overweight I’m just out of shape and started to notice some jiggly bits that I didn’t care for. 

I started working out on January 15th by doing some push-ups/sit-ups and a small workout routine with some weights that I already owned. After just 2 weeks of working out 3-4 times a week I started to feel better. I had more energy and felt happier. It was at this time that I realized that if I really wanted to do this I needed to quit smoking. So on February 7th I quit.

I feel that because I coupled my quitting with another health oriented activity it was easier. The impact on my body that quitting had was so obvious. I had more stamina when exercising almost immediately and felt so much better with each passing day.

I definitely still had withdrawals and cravings. Even today I still have cravings, I’m not out of the woods yet. I don’t think there is anything that can completely take those away but I had goals and other factors helping me to leave the cigarettes behind.

I rapidly out grew the weights I started with and decided to spend the money I would have used on cigarettes to buy myself a better set of weights and a pull up bar. The old plates fit on the new bars too so I have a lot of room for improvement.

My advice to anyone out there struggling with quitting is to pair the act of quitting up with another hobby. Whether it’s something like exercising or learning a new skill. I accidentally discovered just how powerful that can be.

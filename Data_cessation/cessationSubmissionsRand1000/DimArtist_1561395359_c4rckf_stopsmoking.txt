I Failed and Here's Why

So, I was for 40 hours approximately smoke free. I have never argued that I am a strong person. All these hours I have combined smoking with many activities of the day and I was thinking "Hey, I am missing something". I was feeling so isolated. That something should have been there but there isn't. I won't lie. I am reading Allen Carr's method but all this time I was feeling miserable and not happy as the author says. Sometimes in this smoke-free period I was feeling happy for my short achievement but mostly depressed. The fact is that I don't want to feel miserable. I don't want to feel sad. I don't want to feel that I am missing something. You know I don't have many enjoyments in my life and I believe that smoking used to be my companion. My friend. I just don't want to feel more depressed. I need help.

Successful quit - now time to stop using nicotine?

So, almost a year ago, I quit smoking and started vaping.  I started at a high level of nicotine, and gradually reduced it for quite awhile.  I had a few cigarettes in the past year, maybe a pack total - I definitely consider it a successful quit.

Anyway, I had gotten myself down to 6mg in my MTL vape (roughly equivalent to 3mg in my subohm vape) but then lost the MTL one drunken night.  I didn't pick up a pack of smokes, thankfully, but I did switch back to 6mg in my subohm.  I haven't tried to reduce it since then, mostly out of sheer laziness - I didn't feel like mixing up more juice.  I'm now officially out of 6mg juice, and am at a crossroads.  I have a bunch of 0nic juice - just flavor, no nicotine.  I have the ability to turn that into 3mg juice, effectively cutting my current use in half.  

Laziness is showing up again, though, and I think I might just used the 0nic juice - see if I can finally kick the nicotine habit.  In my head, if I can make it through several days without nicotine, I could just plain give it up.  Even if I am unsuccessful, I could mix up a very low nicotine level (maybe 1.5mg?) and be that much closer to being nicotine free.  I'm kicking myself for being so lazy as to have given up the progress from 6mg to 3mg...

Just wondering how folks who have used NRT do when they've gotten themselves down to a low level.  What is the cold turkey step like?  Will it be as bad as when I first gave up cigarettes, and was withdrawing from all the additives?  That was tough, but at the time I still had nicotine to get me through.  I'd love to be free of nicotine for good, even if I keep the (0nic) vape as a digital/oral habit...

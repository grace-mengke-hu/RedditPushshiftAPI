24 hours (okay, really 25)

I'm sorry but I think I may overpost here for a bit until I'm out of the woods! It's helping me to get excited about posting at the end of every 
day.  
So, 24 hours. Bunch of epiphanies today, actually. Nothing too hard, craving-wise, except maybe the beginning of evening. I cooked a lot instead and listened to music. Went on a long walk. Genuinely enjoyable day, honestly.  
The only super obnoxious thing is my sleep schedule. It's hell. I can't sleep for more than 2 hours at a time and they're the wrong two hours. That's been happening since I started cutting down 2 weeks ago. I can't wait for that to end! When does it?  
Also, even after 24 hours, I feel better. No circulation issues, no chest tightness, no sinus crap. I'm sure it gets much better, but it's already a big relief.  
Let's do this, people. Say no to the mind games!

Feeling low

Not really wishing for a cig, just feeling low from other factors tonight. Met my smoking goals this week but fucked off on some other stuff that’s important to me so have to try (again! For the eleventy-seventh time) to get back on track in the face of all the challenges that seem to often get in my way. Real life support would help a lot but it ain’t coming, I’m on my own. It’s hard to make two steps forward, one step back! Thanks for listening; I really appreciate the community here. Live to fight another day tomorrow I guess. The good news is none of this makes me feel like smoking. One day at a time. :)

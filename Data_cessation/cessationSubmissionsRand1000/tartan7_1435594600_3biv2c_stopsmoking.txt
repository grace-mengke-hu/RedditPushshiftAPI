Relapsed. Has anyone quit drinking as a result of quitting smoking?

Feeling very discouraged. After 2 months I fucked up again and was smoking for about a week or two.

Physically I feel awful. My breathing is noticeable worse, I'm tired all the time, and am waking and falling asleep a lot later which is affecting my productivity in general. 

This is the second time I've messed up a pretty good streak. First one was at four months and this time at two. I really thought I had it this time because I've been developing healthy habits (a solid wake up time and bed time, eating right, exercising, developing healthy hobbies such as rock climbing and slackline).

I am confident I can make it through this awful withdrawal period and a couple months in. I believe where these relapses are coming from is having a few drinks and convincing myself one cigarette is ok. Has anyone quit drinking in order to quit smoking permanently? Is this too drastic a measure?

Day 8

After 23 years smoking I am now 8 days into a healthier life. 
I can't understand why it has taken me so long to quit. 
There was always an excuse, just one more packet, next week, after the Christmas holidays etc... All bollocks! 
Don't get me wrong I'm not finding it easy, but I'll be damned if I'm ever going to smoke again. 
To those that try and fail, keep trying, keep failing until you don't.

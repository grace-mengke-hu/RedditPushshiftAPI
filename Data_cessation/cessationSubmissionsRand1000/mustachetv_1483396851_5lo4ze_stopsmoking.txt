I was supposed to quit today...

... but accidentally quit yesterday!

Taking Chantix, on day 8 of it, this is day 2 without smokes. Oddly I'm still having some cravings and feeling a bit anxious, but overall the feeling passes pretty quickly. I took Chantix several years ago and couldn't even force myself to keep smoking the whole week - by day 3 I was so grossed out I just threw my pack out. Anyone else experience it not working as well the second time around? Maybe it's just because the habit is more ingrained now than it was a few years ago. 

It's been really cold where I live (or maybe I'm just a big baby), and we just had a sudden downpour a bit ago. I'm thankful I'm not smoking so I didn't have to freeze/get soaked outside. Instead I've spent the weekend curled up under a cozy blanket with my cat. Much better. :)

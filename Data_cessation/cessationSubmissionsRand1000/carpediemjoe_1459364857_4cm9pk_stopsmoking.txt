What do you look forward to?

My quandary with quitting smoking is that smoking gave me something to treat myself with once an hour and let me take a break from whatever I was doing. 

What have you guys found to replace it? Something not lethal that you can treat yourself with and look forward to.

And yes I realize you are better off going outside and chewing celery than smoking.... But I want to find something I'd actually look forward to.

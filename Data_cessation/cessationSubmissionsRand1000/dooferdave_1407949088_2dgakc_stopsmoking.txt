My day as a non-smoker

* I will drive to work and  and people I drive by will not see my window open.
* I will go to lunch and the waitress might lean in a little closer cuz I smell amazing.
* I will go to the movies and dinner and sit next to people and actually talk to thier face cuz my breath will smell amazing.
* I will see a woman walking a baby that was born AFTER I quit. This kid may come work for me someday.
* I will have gone to bed without having emptied an ashtray.

I am sure there are other things. This was to get you all started.

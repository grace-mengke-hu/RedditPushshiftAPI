40 is real. Even those bumpkin goatherders who wrote the bible knew...

..that after 40 days in the wilderness, you are beyond temptation.  After 40 days your former addiction is as over as you want it to be.  Now I know I'm never going back, and it feels really great.  Keep on truckin' everyone, you are all worth your quit and deserve its massive benefits.

1 Month of Freedom!

Yay! I finally graduated to a star on my badge! Big thanks to this subreddit for support (and not banning me for being a crabby ass).

Holy crap - a month. Highs and lows all-around: The First 6 Days of Hell. The 2 Weeks of Euphoria. The 27 Nights of Insomnia. I'm really proud of myself, and I can really feel the difference.

My senses of taste and smell are back to where they should be - and they are amazing! My fingers are no longer yellow, and my teeth are beginning to get more white again. I've saved $210. I feel more confident, even though that isn't really an issue for me. And *finally* I am sleeping again - the last 2 nights in a row I've slept the entire way through for the first time since I stopped smoking!

The only negatives (or *not-so-positives*) are that my circulation is still a little wonky (I've still got the bluish tone in my hands), my concentration levels still aren't back to normal yet, and I am still getting cravings every day (I will say that for the most part they are *almost* next-to-nothing and rather manageable). I had a *horrible* one last night - but I made it!

For those of you that haven't made the decision yet to be smoke-free, but are still thinking about it - you do have the power to quit, and you can do it!

The benefits of quitting are abundant, and begin very quickly after you quit smoking. So quit smoking! At the end of the day, you're in control, not a stupid, expensive and disgusting cigarette.

And last but not least, whether you are 3 days free, a month free or 2 years free - those are all great milestones. But the secret (and the greatest success of all) is getting through *today*. 

One day at a time!

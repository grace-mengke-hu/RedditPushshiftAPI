I can't fail this time!

I've tried quitting smoking a million times. I have a quit date set for the 30th of september (Australia) and I need it to work this time. I'm desperate to quit but sitting at home all day with 2 kids, the boredom gets to me badly. 

I just need this to work, I can't afford to smoke anymore (ridiculously expensive here), I don't *want* to smoke anymore, my health absolutely can't take it anymore. I have tried everything and I don't know what else to do.

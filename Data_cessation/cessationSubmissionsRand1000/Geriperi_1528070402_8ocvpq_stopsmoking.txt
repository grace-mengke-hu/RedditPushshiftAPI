One year and a half later and couldn't be happier about my choice

I try to imagine the 15.300 cigs I would have smoked since I quit, filling my room, and the 3.000 euros I've saved during this time, burnt. I imagine having to go outside any closed space every 20 minutes to have a smoke, being anxious when I can't have one, running out of breath when trying to run or play football. I imagine that smell on me again, bad breath, yellow teeth, and can't be prouder of myself for saying no. 

To those out there that want to quit, know this: it gets easier soon, and it is worth it. After a while, you'll remember all your bad habits and thank youself for making the best choice of your life.

Day 5, I want to kill, but I see the light

I have been smoking for 9 years, since I was 17.  I was a pack a day by age 18 and I have been since minus a few quit stops.  

When I was 22 I made it a whole 8 months, but really I was just substituting it with weed.  Those were a stoned couple of months.

My smoking went back to normal, then I went to Haiti to work for a while in the relief effort.  5 months of good Haitian cigarettes at 75 cents a pack.  By the time I got back I was addicted as ever - a pack and a half a day or so. Then, as it often happens I met a girl with the conditions that I quit smoking.  Those were the best 11 months of my life.  I got healthy.  I could run again.  I lost 60lbs.  I was in the best shape of my life.  Predictably though, when we broke up, I started again.  My body slowly fell into disrepair again, but things really got bad a year ago.

I was diagnosed with an inoperable tumor in my neck (bone mas caused by a trapeze accident).  Not cancerous, just annoying because it causes a lot of pain, pain that unmedicated keeps me in bed paralyzed and near crying.  The meds i am on dull it and make life bearable but they also take away my inhibitions and make me very compulsive.  

With intense physical therapy I am getting off the pain meds and when I came out of the fog I was disgusted with myself that I started smoking again. 

I am on Day 5.  I want to kill everyone I see, but I know this is temporary.  I have done this before, and I can do it again.  The difference is, I am doing this for myself this time -- not a girl.

I needed to write this out somewhere - get my feelings out in the open.  This is my group therapy.  Reddit.  I love you guys.

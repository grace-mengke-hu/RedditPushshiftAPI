Back to reality.

Hey, folks.

I'm about 1 hour from my last smoke. After a few weeks of committing and relapsing several times (sometimes even after 3 days) I've finally had enough.  I've listened to the "Easy Way.." audiobook around 2.5 times and observed myself very closely and I keep going back. Trying to find any excuse and even acting like a child to get my way.

This recent stint came after being smoke-free for over 2 years. I was at a point where smoking and smokers disgusted me. I picked up vaping then soon convinced myself I could have just one cigarette. And here I am. I almost cried yesterday after telling myself 3 times this was my final cigarette. Now, whatever happens (I know I'll make life a living Hell) I'll make it through. Happy about it or sad, I'm done killing myself.

Good luck everyone. I'm glad I found this subreddit.

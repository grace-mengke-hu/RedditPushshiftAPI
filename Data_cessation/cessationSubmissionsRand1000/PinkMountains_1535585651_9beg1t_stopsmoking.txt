Saying NO really does work

Ok this is gonna sound dumb but I had a friend who I haven’t seen in a while literally ask if I wanted a cigarette while holding it out to me. I said “no thanks!”

I fucking regretted it immediately and started to think how I could take it back. It’s been an hour and I’m back up in my hotel room still thinking about how I should have said yes. But I didn’t, I said no, and that worked that time. 

I think I can’t be that close to people smoking. I thought I was stronger, but I’m not yet. Here’s to saying no EVERY TIME even if you don’t even believe yourself.

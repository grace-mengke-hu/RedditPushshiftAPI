I AM AN ADDICT

I have always approached smoking as something less evil compared to drug addiction or alcohol addiction. It's always felt like my choice and I guess I tricked myself into thinking that way to believe I'm in control. I think this has caused me to fail when quitting because I haven't truly said to myself I am an addict! And when I see myself write that word 'ADDICT' it feels so negative and like that's other people, not me! In fact I feel like deleting that word right now but that's not facing what I have become. Usually I say I am addicted to the nicotine in the cigarettes rather than I am an addict. Seeing myself like this has been difficult. But I have now started to see myself more positively. I feel like everyday that passes that I am cleaner. I now realise that I am always going to feel temptation whether after 3 days, 3 weeks or 3 years go by without smoking but I am finally accepting that I now have to face myself and say I am an addict but I am now recovering.

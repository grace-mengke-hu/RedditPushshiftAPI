Moments

I'm tapping my fingers on my steering wheel when I smell it. The light's red and my eyelids are drooping. Today was a long day. That cigarette smells so good. I speed away when the light changes.

One of the street lamps flickers out as I walk past. There's a group of merrymakers up ahead and a cloud of smoke swirls around them. I'm a little too drunk, so I cross the street. I get to my car and I cry, a little.

-

The alarm's chirping again. How many times I've hit snooze, only God knows. My feet drag across the carpet as I trudge to the kitchen. Coffee cup. Coffee. Porch. Ciga- oh, I suppose not. My coffee tastes like shit.

-

My head's been hurting all morning. I think a storm's rolling in. I remember that in these moments, I'd go for a smoke. Convince myself that it helped. Did it? I take some aspirin instead.

Lunch. Chicken, broccoli, rice. I'm full, but not satisfied. I go outside, take a walk. I think" I'd take a smoke, if someone offered." Would I? Today's 83 days. I decide that I wouldn't.

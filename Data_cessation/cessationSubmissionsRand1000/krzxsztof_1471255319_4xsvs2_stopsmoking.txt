This subreddit makes me happy

Its beautiful that i can see all of you, nonsmokers trying to motivate future non smokers. I quit smoking 4 days ago and since that day I look here every morning, this makes me really happy, becouse I can see, that not only me wants to fight with theese disgusting sticks. All I can say now is that I feel every next day even better, so it keeps me motivated and cravings became smaller and smaller. I was a smoker for 5 years of my life, but I think that is enough to say good bye. Stay strong guys, you can do it!

Just bought a pack

Wife was having a hard day. She had lost her purse the day before and things were tough at work. I met her at a bar where she was doing a trivia night with some co-workers. We had a few drinks in a back patio where there were lots of other people smoking. We left the bar and she asked me to buy her some smokes. I bought the pack and gave them to her. We hung out and talked while she smoked 3 of them. I was tempted to join her and smoke one or at least take a drag when I remembered something the guy in this video said.

"Just one cigarette is a lie. If you choose to smoke after quitting you are not choosing to have 'just one' you are choosing to become a smoker again."

A lot of things this guy said have been really helpful for me for the last three days. If anyone else out there is having trouble with smoking you should really give this video a look. 

Thanks again to drpinkswife for referring the video to me in the first place.

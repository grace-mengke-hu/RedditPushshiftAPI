Here I am! I made it! Ha ha, I made it!!

It's a bit late at night for me an I don't want to get all sappy and start bawling, but I'm here! 365 days! And I made it because of this group! You've kept me sane and focused. You've let me vent, given me advice, encouraged me, and made me laugh. For every upvote, for every kind word, for every piece of advice - thank you. Thank you so very much. Quitting nicotine gave me back my life, it took a huge weight off my shoulders, and I'm getting weepy :) ...so just thank you, this group means the world to me.

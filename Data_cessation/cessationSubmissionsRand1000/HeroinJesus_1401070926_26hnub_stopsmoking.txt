Questions about quitting

I'm done TRYING to quit, this time i'm fucking quitting, no two ways about it, however i've realized there is one issue with this.

My question is to anyone out there who works a customer service job. my job is to answer phones and be nice to people who can sometimes be really upset and shitty, and i get pretty irritable when i've tried quitting in the past. Anyone have any tips on not letting that stuff get to me or keeping the irritability to a minimum? 

Edit: Thanks for all the support guys, it truly is appreciated.

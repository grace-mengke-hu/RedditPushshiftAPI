Just taking a few moments to reflect

Well my 6 month smoke free anniversary came and went and I barely even acknowledged it! But I remember seeing these posts when I was first trying to quit and they really encouraged me, so here it is! 

After 4+ years of smoking cigarettes, I'm officially 6 months smoke free. I have "not smoked" over 2,233 cigarettes in this time (according to the Smoke Free App which absolutely helped me stay on track). I've been working out, and I've lost some weight and I feel genuinely better. 

There are still tough days! There are times when I really want a cigarette. But it's few and far between at this point and I know how strong I've been! Please don't get discouraged if you have a bad day. Hell, don't get discouraged if you have a bad month. Just keep at it and know that it gets better. 

This is a big shout out to everyone in this subreddit who has been so supportive not only to me, but to everybody on here who needs it. Thanks for the support and the advice and occasionally the firm kick in the ass needed to stay the course. 

If anybody needs me, my inbox is open. Ill always be willing to give advice, answer questions, or just listen. 

You can do it!

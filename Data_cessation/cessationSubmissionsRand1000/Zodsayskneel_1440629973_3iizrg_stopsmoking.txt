Day 1, Take 2. How do I get this taste out of my mouth and ringing out of my head?

Smoker of 17, and here's me trying to quit again. Timing it out, I put out my last cigarette around midnight last night. Thinking about my stinky smokey fingers is disgusting.

I went into work happy that I was putting this behind me, but I'm having some physical issues in the afternoon here. This morning my mouth tasted like an ashtray, and that was great motivation as to why I wanted to quit, but it's morphed into some kind of numbing, salivating, metallic taste. Also, my head's been vibrating like a large bell does after you hit it. 

This has been the last two hours for me. I don't remember any feeling like this persisting as much the first time around. Chewing gum takes it away temporarily but starts to annoy me after about five minutes. I keep snacking on almonds from the snack table too, but my brain is telling me the only way to get rid of this isâ€¦ you know. How long is this going to last and what the best way to move past it?

Made my first exams after quitting smoking. Way less stressful than before.

I had a hard time staying off nicotine in this exam period. It wasn't easy. Hard cravings on several occasions. However, i made it successfully, achieved a good grade and my conclusion is that nicotine CAUSED me to panic, rather than RELIEVE my panic in dozens of other exams. I was much more confident without nicotine than with it. Of course I was stressed. But other times when I was smoking, i was 1000x more stressed. Bottom line, if you want to reduce your stress levels for good, quit smoking forever.

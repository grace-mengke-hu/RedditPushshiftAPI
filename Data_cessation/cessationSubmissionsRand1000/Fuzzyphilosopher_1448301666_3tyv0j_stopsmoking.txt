I've benefitted from your support so I think it's only fair to admit I've caved in after 900 days smoke free.

It's real hard to quit so I hope in a back asswards way this may help you folks who are going through the withdrawals early on to keep doing what is best for your health and will keep you around and healthy for the people who love you. 

I'm gonna click on the thing to remove my numbers after I post this. We all know the appeals of smoking, especially when we are stressed but the thing I want to say is Yeah, i fucked up and fell back into it, don't put yourself down for that. 

I'm gonna try again and I hope you will too. People who've never smoked don't respect how hard it is. In the beginning it's like Sisyphus straining over and over fight the urge to smoke up the hill only to have to do the same thing tomorrow. 

That said it really does get easier. I really did forget about cigarettes altogether for years, and you will too. 

I made it over 900 days and I'm glad I didn't have to think about it or keep count but this subreddit did it for me. Those are 900 days I didn't hurt myself, eh? 

I don't like the wagon image people use about addictions personally. I feel it's more like falling off a horse.  

We all get thrown at sometime, the thing is to just keep getting back on.

(I'm preoccupied & crap at following up on things I post anyway, I justed wanted to get this off my chest so while I would like this to generate discussion to help people, I probably won't be replying or contributing. Deep down I suppose I feel ashamed and that's why I don't want to talk about it.) 

Hopefully I'll be back soon aiming for my one week without a smoke number.

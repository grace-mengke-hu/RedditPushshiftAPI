Second day and can't sleep.

Second day in and it's going well except one thing: I can't sleep. I'm not anxcious or craving sigarettes, I just wake up at 1:00 and can't sleep anymore. Didn't have that the first time. Does anybody have the same experience and/or tricks and tips? I tried Oxazepam, meditation, reading, getting up for a bit and then go back to bed. Nothing seems to help..

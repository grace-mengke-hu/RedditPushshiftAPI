Weekend to be proud of

Last night, went to a party. Some people were hanging out on the patio and I stepped outside to mingle. I saw one guy light up a smoke and thought "oohhhh, I could totally bum one from him" and that quickly changed to "no! no, you don't want to!" And then me feeling smugly happy with myself (Internally, totally would never say anything to others for fear of being an asshole ex smoker)

THEN today I went to my folks house, and they are indoor chain smokers.  I was actually pretty ok with everything, except at one time when I realized I was standing next to a dirty ashtray and it made me gag a little.

Surviving this weekend, especially since I was having bad cravings on Friday makes me pretty happy :)

Keep on keepin' on y'all! :)

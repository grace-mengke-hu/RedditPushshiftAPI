I quitted smoking again cold turkeyâ€‹. Almost an hour ago. Please tell me how long will it take to feel normal again?. I have decided to go through this as I have read here it will get better?But how long?

What else can I do to minimize quitting related problems like irritability, anger, rage, depression etc. It's not my first time, but I want to make it my last time attempt. As I don't really want to smoke but I have to smoke to get through my day! . I want to feel good without cigarettes, I don't want to hurt myself and my loved once. But lose control. I always had anger problems and without cigarettes it becomes worse. Mainly I feel low, lost, unnecessary anxiety, over analyzing every fucking damn thing which is not going in the right way in my life . I'm certainly not very fortunate, and I realized life is not fair,  it will never be. I'm 25+. Smoking since when I was 18. Tried to quit but relapsed every time right when I thought everything was going great. I need to fix my life. I need to. I have to. I want to get rid of this illness. I have to. I just want some peace of mind. Some peace. Some satisfaction. I hate when I don't want to smoke but still smoke. I impulsively buy cigarettes when I'm down, low, lost. I smoke like there is no tomorrow. I'm not depressed. Or may be I have low level depression. Whatever the fuck it is, I hate this. I cough, choke and yet I light up. I made hell lot of bad decisions, wrong decisions, I have hurt people who really just wanted to make me feel better. I may sound crazy, but I'm not believe me. Help me with whatever you can.

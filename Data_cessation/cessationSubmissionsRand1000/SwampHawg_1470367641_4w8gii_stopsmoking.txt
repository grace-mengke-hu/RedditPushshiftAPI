Holy Shit Pyle, 0365, I made it.

Burrow through that barbed wire of the early days, being on the other side now is friggen fantastic.  

Once in awhile when it occurs to me I'll say to myself in the morning, 'you won't be having a cigarette today.'  And not even one tiny part of my conscious, sub-conscious or central nervous system gives even the slightest shit that that's the case.  That's how free from it you become.

Stay the course, build up the days, and then it becomes yesterday's news.  Cheers and good luck.

2 weeks!

genuinely didn't think i'd get this far, especially cold turkey! It really is the best way.

BUT, sleeping. Man, i feel like I havent slept much. I'm constantly in and out of sleep all night, horrible, vivid dreams and waking up every few hours! anyone have this problem? Any suggestions on getting a good nights sleep? I go to sleep fine, at the good time? Also, i'm still very irritable, slightest things still very much annoy me!

Definitely dont want a cigerette though :)

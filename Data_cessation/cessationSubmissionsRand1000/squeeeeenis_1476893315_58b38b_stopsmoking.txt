From smoke to Vape, from vape to quit. How long until urges stop?

2 years ago, I made a full transition to vaping. 3 weeks ago, I was fed up hiding the habit, and hit my E-cig with a hammer.

I have quit cold turkey from a decently high nicotine level, I know it would have been smarter to ween down, but I just wanted to end it as soon as possible. 

I found out my Mother had stage 4 lung cancer, so I have been dealing with a ton of stress/ depression so the first week was a huge fucking challenge. I promised myself however, that I am not going to cheat. 

I just want to know, how much longer do I have to deal with the headaches/ cravings? The cravings are no where near what they had been the first week, but they still exist.

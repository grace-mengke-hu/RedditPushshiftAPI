You don't have to quit cold turkey.

A lot of ex-smokers used the cold turkey method to quit smoking cigarettes. I was often told that cold turkey was the most effective method and every other method was just a form of stalling. A lot of ex-smokers who used this method will also sometimes discourage smokers from trying to quit with NRT.

My experience is that there is no one solution. Cold turkey did not work for me. Whenever I tried, it put me in a manic state where I felt like I was going crazy and the world was ending. 

NRT was an effective tool for me in quitting nicotine. I didn't like the patches (didn't produce a "rewarding" high like the other forms of NRT) so I used the mini Nicorette lozenges. It took me about half a year of trying over and over to fully quit. I haven't bought a pack of cigarettes since April. 

Quitting nicotine was slow and required the aid of NRT. For others, cold-turkey might be the only effective method that results in them quitting. My point is: Don't get so wrapped up in how you're quitting. Do what you think will work best.

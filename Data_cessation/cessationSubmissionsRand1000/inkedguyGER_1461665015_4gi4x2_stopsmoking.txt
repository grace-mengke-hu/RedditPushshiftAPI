I've slipped for 3 cigs, but...

Hey guys,

I've just slipped, bought a pack yesterday and smoked 3 cigs before my dentist appointment. 

My dentist said, that the discolouration of my teeth is coming from smoking for sure, so I just got another reason to stop, haha.

On my way home I threw the pack in the trashcan and just start over being a non-smoker.

Keep up with it, it's worth it!

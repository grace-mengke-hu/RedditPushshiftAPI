So I'm at Day 30, still hanging in there...

I hate to be Debbie Downer here, but I have to be honest and say that I have felt like absolute crap over these 30 days.  

I've had a headache every day.  I've had kick-my-ass-and-start-crying cravings.  I've felt sick most of the time and my heartburn's been kicking my ass.  I've been in a horrible mood.

Being around my smoking friends is just killing me, but I haven't caved.  The back of my brain is telling me I might as well start back up since I'm still feeling like crap anyway, but I haven't caved.

I'm still hanging in there, though.  

Thanks for reading my whining.

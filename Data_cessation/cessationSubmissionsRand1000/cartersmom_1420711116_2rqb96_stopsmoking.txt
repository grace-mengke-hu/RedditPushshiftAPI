still avoiding temptation 8th day smoke free and proud!!!

I'm 29 and refuse to be a smoker on my 30th in June, ive been smoking for 15 years anywhere between 30-40 ciggies a day. This is the first time I've ever actually tried to quit too
so I'm now 8 days into quitting still feeling lost when I'm bored but my house is gleaming clean which is a bonus, the school run is awkward now so I get there 10 minutes early to avoid the smokers outside
I'm feeling very positive today after I had a major meltdown yesterday I was upset and crying for no reason but I refused to give in and since I'm very stubborn I know I won't give in 
Feeling extremely proud for going cold turkey my husbands in this with me too which has helped a lot we all need someone to talk to about this 
The smoke free app has helped a lot when I see how much I've saved and how long I've been smoke free for I look at it when I'm tempted and it gives me a kick to see how well ive done... Ive not smoked nearly 400 ciggies so now I know ive avoided that many ive got it in my head I don't need 1 if I don't need the 400 ive not smoked
when I feel a craving I go for a shower, paint my nails, bake, clean or make a cup of tea and have a sugar free sweet (candy) 
stay positive guys lets get rid of the smoking demons together
good luck to everyone just quitting and to all who have quit keep doing what you're doing you're amazing xx

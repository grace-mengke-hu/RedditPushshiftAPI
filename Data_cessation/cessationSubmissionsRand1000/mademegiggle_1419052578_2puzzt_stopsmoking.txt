Day 10 - Depression tonight

Hi all, I'm at day ten and today was a good day. Pretty much no cravings with a lot of trigger moments, but tonight i'm just feeling super depressed and really wanting a smoke. I know that this is just my brain playing tricks on me but I just wanted to vent a little! Keep it up guys, we can do this!

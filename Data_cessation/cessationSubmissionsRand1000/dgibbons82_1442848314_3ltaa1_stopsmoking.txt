So... I really messed up. :( 250+ days down the toilet.

I was doing pretty well at my quit (as you can see from my badge), but I went to Vegas and really screwed up.  I smoked 2 packs of cigarettes while on a work trip.  Granted, I left the cigarettes in Vegas (what happens there, stays there, right?), but I'm thinking that 2 packs can't be ignored.  I'm thinking that I need to reset my counter and my stats.  

What do you think?  At what point do you reset the counter and start over with counting the smoke-free days?   Stupid question, I know.  You reset the counter when you're not "smoke free" any longer.  

My advice:  No matter how good it looks to you at the time, don't throw away 250+ days of hard work.  It isn't worth the hit to your self-esteem when you're done.

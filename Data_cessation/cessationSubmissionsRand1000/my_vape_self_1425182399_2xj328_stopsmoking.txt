You can have fun too. Here is a possible thing.

Ah, the quit-smoking.  It is so serious.  

A very long time back I subscribed to /r/smoking [Spoiler, it involves meat on a grill for a very long time].  It was fun because "Hey, I'm back to smoking" can be an upbeat post to read.

More recently, I added another sub to my reddit subscription list.

I do many strange things.  Some of them do *not* work out.  This one did.  **If English is your first language**, visit /r/titlegore/  

If it seems to work, click on that subscribe button.  Over the next days when you hit your reddit front page you will see new and frequently frightening things.

This is just to add distractions for those that are quitting.

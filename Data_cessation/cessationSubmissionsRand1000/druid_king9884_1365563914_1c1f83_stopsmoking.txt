Since I quit, my father has been diagnosed with emphysema and end stage COPD, my mother has had major back surgery and is in great pain, and I'm struggling in my studies in order to graduate with my first college degree in May because of all this stress.

But you know what? I still haven't smoked one damn cigarette in 20 days. And I have ZERO FUCKING URGE to go back to the cancer sticks. Fuck that shit.

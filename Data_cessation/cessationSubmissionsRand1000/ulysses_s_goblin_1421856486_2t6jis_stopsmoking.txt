I feel more honest

So far, my favorite benefit of being a non-smoker is the feeling of having nothing to hide. Before I quit, I found myself lying about how much I smoked, rationalizing how much I smoked, and constantly worrying that someone at work would discover that I smoked (I work in healthcare.) I internalized that guilt, and am I now realizing that it made me feel less-than. I have a new confidence after being 20 days smoke free, and feel a lot less stressed.

I hope everyone is having a good day!

Bad dreams and what to do afterwards

Strange dreams last night which included me smoking. Woke up to a feeling of crushing anxiety. This isn't one of those sharp, transient cravings; it's more like my ground-state craving level has increased. Normally I would go outside and chain smoke with a book and coffee to calm down and get right. Obviously I've come too far to do that now. Ugh. I need to break the conditioning that tells me to smoke whenever I feel stressed. This sucks and I hope it gets better. Fuck you, cigarettes.

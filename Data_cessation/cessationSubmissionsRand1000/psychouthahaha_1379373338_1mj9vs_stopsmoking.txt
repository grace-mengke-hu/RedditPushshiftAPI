This is day 3

Hi, even if that batch does not show it. Possibly because of time difference. This is the thrid morning without smoking.
I smoked quite a lot, but i always have my phases without them. But this time i dont see any reason to start again. I want the following: run more, ride bike more, smell and drink good tea, go upstairs, more health.

My mind became clear when i told myself, if u continue this will kill u.

I feel ok now. Urge to talk about it, but no urge to smoke. Will ride my bike to work now and then meet up my friends to have dinner. (i am really lucky, i moved to a new country and all the new ppl i met dont smoke. That should make it easy!)

All of you have a nice one. Thanks for reading.

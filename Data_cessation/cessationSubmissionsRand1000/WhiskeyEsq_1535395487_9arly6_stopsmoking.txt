A small victory

Went to Vegas with my fantasy league for our draft this last weekend. Every time I visited that city in the past had me chain-smoking like Walt Disney. Something about being able to smoke any where, indoors or outdoors, I guess. Wasn't really tempted at all this time, but a victory nonetheless. Cheers, everyone.

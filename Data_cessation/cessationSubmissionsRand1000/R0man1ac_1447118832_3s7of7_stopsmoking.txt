It has been over 24 hours since my first non smoking post.

Yesterday I posed that I was going to stop smoking. So far I have made it over 24 hours. I've made it to this point before so it isn't a great accomplishment. 

However I am going to stick through it this time. 

Unfortunately my brain is screaming at me to pick up cigarettes on my way home. 

I hope tomorrow is an easy day as well.

This is not a New Year's resolution, I accidentally started 2 days early

I've had "quit smoking" on my "things to do medium/long term"-list for a while now, but haven't made an attempt yet. I'm actually over 60 hours without a cigarette now, but it wasn't really "planned".

For now I'm kinda cheating. In early 2015 I got a heavy flu and didn't smoke for 5 or 6 days because of it. I never considered quitting during those days - I told myself that I would fail anyway because I hadn't made a conscious decision. Well, I got a flu again right now, so this time I told myself "why the fuck not?" instead. I still haven't made a conscious decision to quit, but I didn't smoke last night when I had HUGE urges to smoke every few minutes for hours. I was really close to cave over a dozen times. Then I woke up this afternoon and felt like I had accomplished something.

I'm really hesitant to even post this, because it would make it real and failure would sting much harder. So if you can't read this, I chickened out.

I'm still very unsure whether this is a real attempt or not, but 60 hours of not smoking is 60 hours of not smoking. And if I fail, maybe I'm gonna hold myself accountable much sooner. I'm not gonna get a flair yet though. That would make it 100% real, and I wanna go on like this for at least another day.

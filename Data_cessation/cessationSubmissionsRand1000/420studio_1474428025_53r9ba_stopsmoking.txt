11 Days

It's just hitting me now. Last weekend I drunkenly had about 6 cigs. I was 11 god damn days away from being a year. I haven't smoked since but... fuck... well gonna reset the badge in the morning and hope to get a whole year starting tomorrow.

Stay on guard people. Even when you know you got it beat it can sneak up on you.

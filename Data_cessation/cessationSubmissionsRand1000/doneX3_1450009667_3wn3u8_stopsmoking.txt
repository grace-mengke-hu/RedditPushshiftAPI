Three weeks. Righteous! Here's what worked.

Today I hit the 3 week mark. Thrilled.

As the year is ending, I thought hard about the coming one. I knew that smoking had to go. I know from the past that life is better as a nonsmoker and there is no such thing as one cigarette. I was resolved. I believe this made all the difference. 

Week 1. Posted here daily. Really helped in weak moments. Good comradery. Lots of exercise

Week 2. Noticed I was drinking more, as if I was switching addictions. Quit drinking. Lots of exercise.

Week 3. Finding myself a bit bored in evenings. Giving it time to find new routines.

All the best to you freedom fighters. Next milestone, 90 days.

Passed the 5 months mark and...

Really feeling pretty good! The first three months were very difficult and I experienced some symptoms of depression and anxiety I was not ready for. At my lowest points I handled unlit cigarettes and smelled them, sometimes lighting them (never putting them in my mouth) and threw them away. 


The difference now is night and day. I don't know if everyone reaches such a point, but I don't even really have cravings now.

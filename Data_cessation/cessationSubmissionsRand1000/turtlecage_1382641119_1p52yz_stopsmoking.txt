For those of you still within the first few days:

It just keeps getting easier and easier. 
Today I got my 2 month badge and I feel fantastic. I'm beginning to forget that I was ever a smoker. 
I never want a cigarette these days. Every so often I have a slight craving and I dismiss it immediately. 

The benefits are incredible! My hair is softer and thicker, my skin is clear, my teeth are whiter, I sleep better, eat better, think better, and feel better. 
Don't forget smell better! 


Keep going! Take it day by day and remember, all you need to do is NOT SMOKE! It's that simple. Don't smoke today. And tomorrow, don't smoke again. 

:) Thanks

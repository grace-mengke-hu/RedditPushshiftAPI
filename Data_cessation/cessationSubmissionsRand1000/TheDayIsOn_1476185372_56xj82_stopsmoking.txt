One year baby!! Drop the mic!

Today I hit my one year anniversary of quitting and could not be more happy or proud.  I know we all think of ourselves as special but I really do believe I am living proof of the old cliche, "If I can do it you can do it too."  I smoked a pack to two packs a day for about 28 years. I did quit a few times, the longest was 10 months about 10 years ago, but always failed due to the "just one" trick.  This time I knew I couldn't have that one so any time I thought about it I shrugged it off. Plus, for some reason one year ago I just decided I didn't want to be a smoker any more.  No more excuses!

It still wasn't easy but I used this sub as support so thank you all.  I also downloaded the SmokeFree app which I highly recommend! It helped me focus with the missions in the first 30 days and track the money I was saving. I'm at $3,200 now.  I'm actually saving the money too which is a huge motivator for me too. 

My health is great.  I put on some weight but it's mostly muscle now because I also took up working out again and running.   I run almost every day now.  It was my thing to do when I first quit to keep my mind from thinking about smoking. 

My teeth are white. My tongue is pink. My skin feels better and l look healthy. My knuckles aren't dry and cracked. My fingers aren't stained. I don't stink like an ashtray.  My car is clean and smells good.  

New quitters you can do it if you really want to.  There is no downside to quitting!!!!

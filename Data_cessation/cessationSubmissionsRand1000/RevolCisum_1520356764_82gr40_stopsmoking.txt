Day 2

It's really more like day 5 but I slipped, so I restarted my count.  But today feels awful.  Is anyone else getting awful heartburn after quit?  I take daily meds for GERD anyways, but it's really bad today.  I'm also having serious sinus drainage.  I'm sure the sinus drainage is a good thing, but there's so much of it!  Still feeling strong, using nrt to get me through this first bit.   I'm so excited to be done with smoking and thinking that my body is working on healing!

3 years baby!

It has been a crazy three years.  Quitting smoking was the catalyst for me changing my whole life.  Since quitting I've turned into a fit and healthy guy.  In my mid thirties now and I am stronger and healthier than ever.  This year alone I've run over 500km, most of it up and down mountains.  Since quitting I've run over 2000km, which is roughly 2000 more than I ran before quitting.  

Not much of value here, just me patting myself on the back!  Wooooooooooo

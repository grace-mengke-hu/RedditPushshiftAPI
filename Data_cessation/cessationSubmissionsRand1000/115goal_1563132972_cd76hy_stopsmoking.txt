I need motivation. Please help.

I’ve made some embarrassing posts on this thread stating dramatic things every time I think I’m gonna quit. The longest I went was 3 months at the beginning of the year and then two months again at one point, but I keep going back. I keep trying to write manifestations that I want clean light lungs but every night I end up smoking two Cigarettes thinking they help me “feel the mood” more as I listen to music and contemplate everything. 

I’ve already read Allen Carr’s book, and that helped me the first time when I quit for 3 months. I have the app for stop smoking, but I reset it like candy. People in my house smoke, so that’s where I get the cigarettes from, and no I can’t ask them to hide them or avoid it. And my country doesn’t have any programs or support groups. No one in my life actually knows I smoke but my body does and I hate how I feel after. Help 😭

1 month, 3 days; I seem to have hit a wall

So this quit has been going exceptionally well. I stopped using my e-cig after about two weeks and I finally hit a month a few days ago. However, it's been really tough the last few days. I even had to use my e-cig a couple times (nicotine free juice). I thought after a couple weeks it would be smooth sailing but it seems that the one month milestone is my wall. I've been having super vivid dreams about smoking the last few days, so vivid I can literally taste the cigarettes. I've come close to just saying fuck it and going to the gas station to pick up a pack. Only thing keeping me from going through with it is remembering how much money I'm saving. So tell me, has anyone else hit this wall after a month or so?

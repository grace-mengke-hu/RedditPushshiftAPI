Just wanted to say THANK YOU. Thank you my brave fellow Redditors for keeping me company during these hard days. Today's 4 weeks smoke free for me. Attaching my colourings as a clickbait (it's a great way to keep my hands occupied)

In my previous post I informed you that I had lost my job on the day 4th, but somehow managed to resist to smoke. It made me feel strong and proud. Still no new job, but I've got few interviews scheduled for next week. Thank you for your kind words and all the support. This sub is simply awesome.

I've been treating myself with extra care lately, doing yoga almost everyday, biking, cooking healthy food and eating way too much dark chocolate. I'm drinking liters of ginger/lemon/honey tea and have abstained from beer and coffee for the time being. My house smells nice and my clothes and me myself (wooow).

Also I used my free time to take some professional online courses. 

I simply feel **happier** without cigarettes.

AND REMEMBER. **IT GETS EASIER EVERY DAY.**

all the best to you guys

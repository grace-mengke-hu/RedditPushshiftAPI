I recently experienced a few strange cravings. Have you been there?

The mind is a strange thing. After 4 months smoke free... well past the craving stage, I experienced a few days of random pop-up cravings that perplexed me. 

When I followed the thought of smoking thru to how if would feel/smell/taste to actually light up and inhale, I was turned off. Still, the craving for 'the moment' of smoking would appear again out of the blue.

During this time, I had a couple of dreams where I turned down cigarettes just before I lit one up.

Like I said, the mind is a strange thing, to suffer this after 4 successful months of smoke-free. 

I won't smoke. But I just wanted to share this. Can anybody relate? Can I get a witness?

What do y'all do after an argument while quitting? Especially those with histories of self harm?

So, I am quitting and hubby is not. 


Withdrawal hasn't been terrible so far because I am using the patch (and also it is day one lol), but it has still been affecting me. When he got home I was happy to have him as a distraction, but he kept snapping at me. I guess withdrawal is making me more "flat" than usual (which I do not deny), so while I feel pretty happy my emotions are kinda subdued. We were watching YouTube and I guess I just wasn't happy enough or something because he suddenly decided he wanted to be alone and told me to go to bed. 



So naturally I was like "wtf" and he told me what I said above about not being happy or whatever. And now he is watching videos alone and I am stuck in the living room. 


And to make things more fun, all the withdrawal I didn't have to deal with before seems to he hitting me now. Ha. Feels like the very beginning of a panic attack. Cause normally I would just smoke a cigarette and be like eh, whatever, but now I feel violent. Not toward him, because that isn't my nature, but I have a serious desire to slice my arms open. Which is bad and I will not do, but I might cut. And I don't wanna do that cause I don't want more gnarly ass scars, plus he hates it when I do that. 



But what do y'all do with that feeling of depression, rage, and loneliness?

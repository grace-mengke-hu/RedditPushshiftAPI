Day 4 complete

Now, whoever said that day 3 and day 4 are not the easiest, are obviously not kidding. The last 4 hours are truly the worst for me in the last four days. I had two super cravings in less than two hours and If I had not been indoors, I would have bought and smoked. But I am so glad I didn't. I distracted my mind, which is not easy, and let the craving pass. At the time of experiencing the cravings, I was struggling to think why I had given up smoking in the first place and that one cigarette doesn't hurt. My mind said that I was strong for three days and even If i smoked one, I could stay smoke free at least for the next three days. I know its not true. Instead of arguing with my mind, I let the time pass. I only hope God will give me strength to endure what's going to come in the future. Thanks for reading.

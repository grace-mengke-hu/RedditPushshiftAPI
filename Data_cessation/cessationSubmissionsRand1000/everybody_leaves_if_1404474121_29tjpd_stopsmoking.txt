First milestone

I made it! Couldn't have done it without all of you : )

Woke up today feeling considerably better than the last two days, when I had heavy quitter's flu. My head still feels achy and my nostrils feel on fire, been sneezing a lot today, but the awful nausea and physical pain in my teeth and jaws has subsided. Oh and I NEVER WANT TO SMOKE AGAIN ; )

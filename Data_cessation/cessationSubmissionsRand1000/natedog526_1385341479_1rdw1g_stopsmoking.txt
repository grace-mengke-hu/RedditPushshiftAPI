2 weeks now

Its been 2 weeks since my last smoke. There have been times where I have wanted one but the craving is less intense than it used to be. It's almost as if it were background noise now, but the kind of background noise that you are fully aware of and doesn't completely take away from whatever it is you are doing. These cravings only seem to flare up the worst when I have nothing to do though, mostly on my days off. I've also noticed I'm a little more irritable. I don't really like being this way, but on the plus side I feel more confident, more happy, and just... better. According to an app on my phone I have saved a good deal bit of money. I'll admit though, I'm guilty of already spending that money on a few cheap games I found on steam that looked interesting. Damn the holidays and Steam for having there awesome sales. Oh well, at least the money is going towards something I can enjoy for several years down the road, instead of something that will kill me several years down the road. Also I am back at the gym again. Last week was my first week and while it was difficult and I felt exceptionally sore, making again questions certain life choices, it felt great. I will continue to make posts here and there in the hopes that I can inspire another person to step up and walk the path of a former smoker, and to keep me on track. Good luck to everyone who is pursuing this endeavor.

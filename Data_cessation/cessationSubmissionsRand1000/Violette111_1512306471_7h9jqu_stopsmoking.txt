New and gradually cutting smoking

Hi, this forum has been super helpful and I would just like to share my journey so far.

History: Almost a pack a day smoker, been smoking for about 10-11 years, I just turned 30. Few months ago I started noticing that my urges to smoke became worse and actually I didn't like it, in fact I hated it every time I smoked...I guess it just hit me...I need to stop.

Started a month ago, my plan was to first realize and capture the no. of times I'd smoke. I decided to cut down to half which is 10 sticks a day. I had a note indicating the timing I would smoke. From week to week, I would reduce the number...

Now I'm at less than 5...I noticed that when I'm at work, it's a lot more challenging  (work stress - in creative industry, surrounded by people who smoked), so I introduced NRT (nicotine gums) to help me stick to the number and its working well so far. I was a little concerned if this is defeating my plan to reduce since the gums has nicotine but I know for sure it's a lot better than smoking it with other toxic chemicals...I'd appreciate if someone could share if you went through a similar plan like this..

Weekends - I'm proud to say that I managed to reduce to only 2 and not relying heavily on gums. I alternate with regular sugar free gums. I almost hit the 24 hours smoke free mark until late afternoon when my craving got me real bad... I guess I need to try harder...

Conclusion, since I started this plan, I would say 90% of the time I no longer have the desire to smoke, or do I really think about it. Well, thanks to the gums...The day when I caved in, I didn't even finish the cigarette, after a few puffs, I felt disgusted...

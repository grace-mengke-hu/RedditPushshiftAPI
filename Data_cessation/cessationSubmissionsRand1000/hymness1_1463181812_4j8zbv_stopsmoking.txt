I feel angry at myself for having quit

It is just so weird. The first month has been pretty tough, but after, like a piece of cake. I quit using Zyban, I stopped mid-therapy (1 month and a half) since it was causing other problems, but it was kinda easy.

I've been going out with friends, doing things I would do while smoking, and it's not tough. I suppose I'm lucky.

However, and it's kinda silly, I would become totally red of anger every once in a while, for absolutely no reason. Well, there's a reason. I feel like I'm angry at myself for having quit. And I don't even feel the need to smoke!

What the hell is going on? It passes after maybe 15 seconds... But during these times... Man do I hate myself. Is it something normal? Does it stops at some time?

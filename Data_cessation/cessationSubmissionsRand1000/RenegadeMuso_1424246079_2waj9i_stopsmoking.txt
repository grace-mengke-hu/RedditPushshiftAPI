Last night, I got completely shitfaced....

We had some drinks after work, and I decided to enjoy the free booze. My supervisor called it a night at around 9pm, and all the colleagues decided to go home one by one after that. Not me. 

I decided to let the night continue. I found myself at a joint that I used to frequent and met up with some randoms there. 

It was around 10 minutes into the conversation when the dude offered me a smoke. It was the familiar of the environment, drink in hand and talking shit, that for a split second, my body reacted in the direction of accepting the smoke. 

But then I thought, "Hang on, I don't smoke any more". I told the dude, "Thanks, but no thanks", and continued talking shit. 

They must of smoked 10 smokes in that 30 minutes around them, and I used to do that on a normal night out. I did not enjoy being covered in the smoke, but I stayed for the sake of being a sport. After all, I didn't give a damn about the non-smokers when I smoked. 

I am proud that I said "No thanks" to the smokes. It would have been so easy to just take a drag. In fact, at some point the dude ask me to hold his cigarette whilst he did something else. Again, I was strong enough to not smoke. 

That is not all!

I found cigarettes and lighters in my car this morning. They were under the seat. I took them and gave them to the first smoker I found. Well, I could have disposed of them, but I thought that would have been such a waste. 

My mind is stronger now. I can really say that I think I am going to make it. Four weeks ago, I didn't believe that I could make it, but now, I will never smoke again.

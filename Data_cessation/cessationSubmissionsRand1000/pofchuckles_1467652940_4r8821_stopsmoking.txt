Day 28! Week 5 tomorrow!

Seriously go back a few weeks on this thread and look at some of my topics ive started. If your looking for inspiration look at me (sounds arrogant sorry!) for two years I had a few panic attacks and a lot of anxiety. I realized it comes from not excersizing anymore and 9 years of smoking. My teeth started to get messed up. So I quit. Week 3 worst anxiety of my life. Now I have no anxiety I realize the smoking caused it. I have played football 5 times in 4 weeks and scored lots of goals. I previously hadn't played in 5 years. Also played drop in hockey and basketball because I now feel I can run a bit again. If I beat it anyone can. My gums hurt now (which is normal) and my throat hurts ab bit but that's normal to! But yeah Anxiety?what anxiety. Quit and be you again!

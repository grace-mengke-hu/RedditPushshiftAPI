Back on the 3rd day!

I quit for a whole month and then had some drinks, bought one cigar, and slippery sloped all the way into a pack every other day.

Wondering if I should just give up wine too if I want to be successful. Reading back your posts...seems a lot of you feel much stronger after 4 months.  Any advice?

PS. I feel crazy but I know this is the worst day from all my quits. So I'm just going to be socially awkward and weird all day. oh well.

One month today! Woot!!

After 20 years of a pack or more a day. What a wild ride this has been! If there was a withdrawal symptom to be had, I have had it. Still feeling disoriented, dizzy and confused most of the time, but I've only been completely nicotine free for 2 weeks (did step down method with ecig) so I'm hoping that goes away soon. It feels like a constant hangover! Everything says "3 days" to start feeling normal but that hasn't been true at all for me. 

I think I've managed to lose patience with and piss off just about everyone I know, and there have been times when I've wanted to start back just because of how I've acted toward other people and screwed up at work. If there was ever a "bad time" to quit, this would be it. My manager even got a little upset at me for quitting "at this time". 

So, someone please tell me this is all worth it...

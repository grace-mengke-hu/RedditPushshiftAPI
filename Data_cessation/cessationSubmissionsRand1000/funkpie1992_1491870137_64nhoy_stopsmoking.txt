Just stopped..

Hi guys, 

I quit for about 3 months which ended unfortunately about a 6 weeks ago. I tried quitting again which lasted just under a week. 

Here's the odd thing though, I got a very slight gum infection, which I'm used to with the amount I smoke, and now I just don't feel I want any. Just like that, from crippling necessity to a lingering thought. This is day 4 now. 

Anyone else ever experienced this and does anyone know if it's likely to last? I'm sure going to try to make it last!

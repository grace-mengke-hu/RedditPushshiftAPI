[Day 18] The cravings don't stop

Cravings will decrease over time, but they never go away completely. You'll go 2-3 days wanting a cigarette many times, and some days you'll hardly think about it. The key is to acknowledge your cravings and just accept them for what they are - your addiction talking. Stay strong and don't feed the addiction. Remember, there's no such thing as just one cigarette.

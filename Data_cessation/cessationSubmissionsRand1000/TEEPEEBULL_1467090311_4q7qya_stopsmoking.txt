Two Years - Smoke Free - Nicotine Free

Smoked for over 30 years, went "cold turkey- Alan Carr" 2 years ago. And I haven't had a smoke, a vape, a patch, a lozenge or any nicotine.

 I can't say I wasn't craving in the beginning, but, I watched that Alan Carr video a hundred freaking times if I watched it once. I bought the audio book and listened at work too.

After all that I heard- smoking made no sense to me any more.

I finally got it- the only reason I was smoking, because I smoked!!

With drawl. That's it!!  All the other excuses were BullShite* . Stress relief was actually - with drawl relief.

Pause to concentrate-= with drawl relief.

Solidarity with my smoke mates- with drawl relief.

Wake Up call= with drawl relief

Smoking wasn't my identity, my friend, my comfort- it was sucking the life outta me!!
No More.

I wish for everyone to be free....understand what that you can be free, that what you believe smoking is- is a LIE! When I saw the truth, and the truth sunk in, I was ashamed that I allowed it to go on for so damn long. Like a sucker to the tobacco company.

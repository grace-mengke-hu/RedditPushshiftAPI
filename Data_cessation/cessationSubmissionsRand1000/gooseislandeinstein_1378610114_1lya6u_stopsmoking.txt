cleaning out my lungs.

so i was a very heavy smoker and now i am quit, for almost a year. i had some problems with feeling that my lungs werent clearing themselves out and i have come on here asking questions about it for a long time. finally i have found the answer, at least to my problems, so i thought i might post it for you guys! first of all drink water, that has helped me more than anything. second of all i started eating raw ginger. i ate a slice or two of ginger and in the hours afterwards as well as the morning after i feel like my lungs are better. i have no scientific evidence for this other than how i feel, but it is  the answer to my question so i thought i would share! keep on quitting!

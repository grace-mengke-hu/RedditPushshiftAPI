Day 14 complete

Time flies by pretty quickly. 2 weeks and a new icon in the flair. I can't believe its been 2 weeks already. No major cravings. I am feeling confident and feel as if everything is under control. I still feel tight chested, especially during running. But I guess its normal. It would take few months to become better I guess. May be I should stop thinking about smoking and get on with more important things in my life now. Thanks for reading.

Stressed

I'm about 20 days into this quitting thing but the past few days are making it feel like my first day all over again. The stress of my life has been slowing rising and all I want is that 5 minute reprieve a cigarette gives me. I know that I'll feel like shit after but I feel like I need  that 5 minute reprieve from life only a cigarette can give. The way I feel right now I just want a smoke, hard work be damned.

(Sorry needed a place to vent)

24 Hours. What a ride.

Hello fellow non smokers.

I smoked for many years. Then I quit for many years. Then I smoked for a year, then I quit for many years. After about 5+ years smoke free the devil found its way in my pocket, and I started smoking again last december.

I used it as a stress relief. I told myself it wouldn't get out of control....

A little over 24 hours ago I had smoked TWO AND A HALF PACKS by mid day!  I was trying to mask every single point of stress in my life with a nonstop chain of smoking.

I couldn't believe how much I had smoked. Not even 15 minutes later my fingers were tapping for another. It was so ridiculous that I was finally able to see myself from a different perspective. There was no way I go back to the gas station for more cigarettes, it was asinine.

So here I am. I've quit again.

My right eye won't stop pulsating. I can't stop touching my face. I've paced. I've fidgeted. My head hurts. Food is unsatisfying. 

I know this gets better with time, but what a wild ride phase 1 withdrawal is.  It is incredible how badly nicottine effects us, and we don't even realize it. It feels like my face is eating its self.

In the very least, the rest of life's problems can take a back seat temporarily as I deal with this exclusively. 

Here's to the future and reclaiming my health.

Muscle cramp question and smoking dream

I've been having muscle spasms/cramping in my right calf for the last day or so, which never happens to me.  Could this be related to quitting?

Also, I dreamed last night that I relapsed.  I was driving down the road smoking on my way to meet my SO and I was so disgusted with myself.  As I pulled out a pack of gum and started spraying myself with cologne, I couldn't believe I was smoking after getting a whole week smoke-free.  Then... I WOKE UP!  I can't describe the relief.  Pure bliss and very motivating to keep going, which is great, because I've gotten this far and further in past stops, only to find my biggest challenges and craves after the actual physical withdrawal has passed.  While I'm thrilled to be a week without cigarettes and have been feeling strong, I've been feeling nervous about overconfidence and crumbling in the coming days and weeks.

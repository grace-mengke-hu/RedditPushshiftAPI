16 months, or whatever

Hey guys.  The other day I went to the hospital.  I told two people I quit smoking for 16 months.  It was pretty cool, because I told them both quitting "was hard".  After 12 months, I haven't even thought about it any more.  I even quit this subreddit.  Keep it up everyone.   And read the "book"

Edit: But I'll probably keep lurking here anyways.  I love this subreddit!

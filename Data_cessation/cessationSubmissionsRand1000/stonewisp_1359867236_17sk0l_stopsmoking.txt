day 5.36262831

New to this sub - I've never been a pack a day smoker, and I only started a couple years ago, but I'm on day 5 of quitting. So far not too bad. Today I had work and was irritated but didn't crave a cig that bad. 

My cravings were pretty bad the first couple days, but I've been sick as a dog with the flu since Tuesday so smoking would just plain hurt! 

Since I've been somewhat isolated from the world I haven't been tempted by other smokers and am sort of concerned about relapsing when I get better. But as long as I can predict those sort of situations Ill stay clear!

 I smoked a spliff on Friday so I feel like I kinda cheated but I'm gonna try to go the rest of the week without tobacco trees. 


They say there's a three day hump for detox, I wish I knew that a long time ago. It's becoming increasingly easier day by day. 

much love and good luck to all! get over those first few days! you can do it!

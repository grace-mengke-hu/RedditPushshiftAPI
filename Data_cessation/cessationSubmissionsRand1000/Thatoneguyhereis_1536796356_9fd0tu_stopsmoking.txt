Quit smoking 11 days ago and now Super stressed and tempted to go get a pack

So some shitty news just hit me recently don’t feel comfortable sharing on here but I am super stressed out right now. I already worked out today so can’t do that and I tried to hit up friends and family and they are all busy at the moment I am really tempted to grab a pack to atleast alleviate my stress.

I fell right off the wagon.

It's so ridiculous. I beat myself up for every time I light up. I smell it on myself and dread the odour. I hid it from my roommates as much as I can. I went 2 months and fell off the wagon full force. My one roommate knows and expressed such a sincere concern that I feel like a damned fool for failing myself. I need to quit smoking. I want to improve myself and here I am falling to the same old habit of smoking cigarettes. My pack has 3 left. I don't want to finish it. I'm not going to. I have a full pack that I'm considering giving to a coworker. I think I should just throw it in the trash and be done with it. I went 62 days without the damned things. I'm going to do it again. 

Thank you for the support. Just seeing the posts by others is inspiring.

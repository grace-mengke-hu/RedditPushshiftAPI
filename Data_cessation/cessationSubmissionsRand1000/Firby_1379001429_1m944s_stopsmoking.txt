46 years smoking, 93 days free

You always wish you hap stopped earlier, but no good crying over spilt milk. Had a real shaky day yesterday, felt dizzy, head was sort of buzzing, it was nicotine chatter telling me to have a smoke. It passed but was a mega craving. It's always going to be there I suppose.

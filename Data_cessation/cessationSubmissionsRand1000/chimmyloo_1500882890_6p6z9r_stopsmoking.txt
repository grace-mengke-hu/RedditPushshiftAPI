I forget about cigarettes the majority of the time now!

I never would have imagined this but it's so AWESOME to suddenly have an old trigger and think, "oh yeah, I used to smoke when I did this, totally forgot about that". That first week was brutal so I'm glad I'm feeling better now.

Of course I am still having the occasional smoking nightmare but other than that, I feel like it's smooth sailing!

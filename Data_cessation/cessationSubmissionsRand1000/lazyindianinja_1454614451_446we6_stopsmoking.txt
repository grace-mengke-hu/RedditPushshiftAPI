Day 1 Again! Your help is needed!

Any encouraging words that I can look at whenever I get the urge will be mighty helpful. I want to quit. Desperately. Will keep this sub as my ammo. Any tips or suggestions that may have helped you quit and stay off will be amazingly helpful too. Just looking forward to reading your replies to get me through the day.

TGIF and here they come the bloody cravings

Currently I’m at 7 days, it’s past midnight, and I want to go out and get a new pack again.
tl;dr: non-regular-ish smoker, wanting to fight the cravings 

Smoked on and off for around 10 years, but was never heavy like. Started in school when I was 13, didn’t smoke much but always kept a few packs of chewing tobacco around, and stayed hooked.

Longest quit period was in college, 5-6 months. I used to smoke from quarter to half a pack a day, and more only when drunk.

The main problem now I think is that I can’t let it go entirely. At times, I would cut down to 1-2 fags a day, to take the edge off at night, or sometimes I would stop for a few days just to come right back at it.

I usually have the strongest cravings on Friday nights and during the weekend. Wanting to drink too, and after a couple of drinks I would always end up buying a pack if I don’t have one stashed from last week.

Sometimes I keep telling myself that it’s not that bad, I rarely let myself drink more than once a week, but I skip my weekend sesh just as rarely, so smoking stays or finds its way back anyway.

If I don’t do the weekly ritual of consuming the substances I start to feel a lot of tension (anxiety?) until I get drunk again and recalibrate.

I used to have the traditional triggers as well, like a cigarette in the morning or after a meal, but now it’s mostly either when I’m drunk or when I’m sober for too long.

Is there a way to work around this pattern?

P.S. I didn’t go to the shop yet, but I feel like going, and had no alcohol tonight

200 days celebration

So I made it to 200 days. I can say that I feel immensely proud of myself and that my life is completely different to 200 days ago. I'm so much more focused on where I want to be in life and wonderful things have happened for me. I have decided that I am going to buy a small cake for me and a candle that says 1 when I get to one year. I think it's worthy of something to mark the occasion. :)

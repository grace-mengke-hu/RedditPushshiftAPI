I started smoking again

So I stopped (Or so I thought I would) smoking some time last year. Went strong for a while and then one evening, while having a few drinks with friends, I just picked up a cigarette from my friend's pack and had lit it up. Since then it's just been spiraling downwards. I feel really shitty. In fact, after the relapse I started smoking more than I used to anyway (About 20-25 cigarettes a day). I've just now decided not to smoke again and I feel positive this time. Just wanted to write this down somewhere. Thanks for reading. :)

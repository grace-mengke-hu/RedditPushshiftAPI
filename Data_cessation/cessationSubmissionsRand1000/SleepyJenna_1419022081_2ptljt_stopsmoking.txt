One month! [club31]

So, I'm one month in and officially dropping my nicotine from 12ml to 6ml today! I've been mixing the two for the last couple weeks to prepare for this and I feel pretty ready. :) I feel unstoppable. Since day 1 I've felt so dedicate to making this the last time I quit and I owe a lot of my motivation to consistently visiting this subreddit! Yay! Happy Friday everyone!

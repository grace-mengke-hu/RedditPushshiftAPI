Don’t envy smokers, pity them, they will envy you.

I’m waking up in a few hours to my day 5. Yas. 

Smoked for almost 5 years, stopped enjoying cigarettes two years ago maybe. I tried to quit soooo many times but it never worked. 

Wednesday night I decided to check out what all the allen carr’s recommendations in this sub were all about. Since I’m not an avid reader I typed allen carr on youtube and found an hour long video called easyway. Watched it and fell asleep. Went to work the next day and the day after, had a long night of gaming on friday and got tipsy on wine yesterday and not a single cigarette. 

I never felt this good, healthy and happy. I totally recommend the video (or the book) to anyone tryna quit smoking, watch it today and not tomorrow. 

A big thank you for each and everyone of you in this subreddit, you guys are THE best &lt;3 

With love,

Dave

Once, again day 1. Any suggestions for food cravings?

So last month I managed to stop smoking for a week, but that weekend Alcohol shat on my parade.... 

Not wanting to acknowledge that I'm a spineless swat that's addicted, I've decided that i'll stop again. And the sooner the better.

I personally don't have a lot of problems with the cravings during the day. But i do notice that I'm hungry 24/7 now... 
Bigger points is that i live in China, and I want to make sure that what i eat is healthy. (come to think about it... I've almost never seen a fat Chinese... but besides that)
Does anyone have any suggestions for food cravings?

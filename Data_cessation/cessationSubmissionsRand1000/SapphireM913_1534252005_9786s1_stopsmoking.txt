Need Input on Quit Depression

I am bipolar and am no stranger to depression. I hit a very very deep low yesterday and couldn't stop crying. I'm on day 14 of my quit and am using patches and lozenges. I need to know if the depression that some people feel goes away on its own and about how long it takes. Also, if you're prone to mental health issues, that knowledge would help as well. 

My goal here is to determine if I need to contact my psychiatrist to get an antidepressant added to my meds or if this tends to clear itself up. I don't want to jump to conclusions, but if it's not going to go away very quickly (a week or two), I don't want to wait until it's worse and I'm non-functional.

Thanks, everyone. Crowdsourcing knowledge is powerful and awesome.

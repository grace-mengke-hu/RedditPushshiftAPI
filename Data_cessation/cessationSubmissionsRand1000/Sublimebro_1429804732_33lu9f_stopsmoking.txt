I turned down a cigarette in my dream last night.

I'm 450 days no smoking and before this I was still getting those guilty smoking dreams. You know the ones. Where you smoke in your dreams and then for 10 minutes after you wake up you feel like a guilty cheating cunt. 

Well anyway last night in my dream people were shoving cigarettes, cigars, and electronic cigarettes in my face trying to make me smoke. I even held the electronic cigarette for a minute for the guy. I simply explained to them that I couldn't do that because I would lose all of my progress! This may not seem like much but I feel like it's a pretty big milestone. And prossibly my final big one. 

Thanks for reading!

Depression after quitting smoking: what helped the most?

I know that the depression I've been experiencing over the past few days is related to smoking cessation, so I'm refusing to give in to its depression bullshit mind spiral. That said, for those of you who experienced similar issues, I'd love to know what your coping mechanisms were/are.  
  
Certain kinds of exercise? Certain foods or vitamins? More water? Waking at a certain time? More existential-style things?  What helped you through it?  
  
Thanks, group, you are awesome.!
  
EDIT: In case it matters: my badge says 2 days, but I really began "quitting" smoking about 12 days ago. I had some minor slip-ups so reset my badge. So, I'm not 2 days into cold turkey or anything; I'm not even really having withdrawals or cravings anymore. Mainly just fatigue like a mofo and depression-style brain gremlins that tell me that my life is a waste. :/

Stopping NOW.

I've smoked since my 15, I'm in my fifties now. Almost 40 years.

I've tried to stop about a dozen times. 

I always got trapped by the thought that 'just one won't harm' and picked up the chain again.

I'm on champix, 1 day clean now.

Don't wish me luck, luck has nothing to do with it. Wish me perseverance and  courage.

Somehow I made it to day 9 without killing anyone.

This quit has been a freaking doozy. Lots of moving stress, delayed paycheck, big bills, internet service provider drama (I work from home and today I had to set up shop in my rental property's clubhouse), and somehow I have not only managed to quit, but also not tried to eat anyone out of rage. Yay me!

First week

I'm about a week in, and while it is an accomplishment, the process is nowhere near over. It might never be, actually. I know it's going to get easier every day but I fear I'll never get completely over it. I have enough willpower to fight every craving, sure, but will they ever stop? This thought is haunting me.
Good thing I don't have any cigarettes around because I would've probably lit up by now. Shit, this is killing me. In a few minutes when this passes, I'm gonna feel so dumb for even thinking of smoking. 
Fuck cigarettes, guys. Seriously. Possibly the stupidest thing I've ever done was to start.

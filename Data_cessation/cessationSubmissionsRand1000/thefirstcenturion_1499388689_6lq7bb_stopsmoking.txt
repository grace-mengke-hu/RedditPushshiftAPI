48 hours plus quit and haven't had a craving.

I quit on the 4th of July after a big work gig ended. My industry is known for heavy smoking so it's been hard to quit since most people I know smoke. But so far I've been around other guys smoking and no cravings yet. Already the scent of the smoke is changing. Here's to hoping this sticks!

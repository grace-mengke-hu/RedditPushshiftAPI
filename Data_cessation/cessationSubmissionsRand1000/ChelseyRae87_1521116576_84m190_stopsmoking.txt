Went into a corner store and didn't get a craving! Day 11 and feeling pretty great :)

Hey y'all! So, I'm sliding into day 11 like a BOSS. I can now go into a corner store for a coffee and gas and not even consider buying a pack. It wasn't until i was sitting in traffic (that's when i get most of my cravings) that it even occured to me that I could have bought a pack. I've been avoiding going into stores where i can buy smokes (yay for cvs!) and avoiding all other aituations that may be triggers, but i think I'm ready to face my next hurdle. 
This weekend is my sister's 30th bday. I'm going to have to spend time with her and she smokes a LOT. I've been avoiding her and her wife for 11 days to avoid feeling like i can bum a smoke. Last time i tried to quit i made it a day and a half and then bummed one from them. It was too easy. 
The good news here is that I don't feel like I need to smoke anymore. I get more a "i feel like my hand should be busy" type thing, so I'm feeling pretty confident about testing my willpower this weekend. :)

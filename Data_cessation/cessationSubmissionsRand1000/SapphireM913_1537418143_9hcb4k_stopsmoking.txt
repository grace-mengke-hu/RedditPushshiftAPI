Sex is still a trigger...

I haven't been getting much action since my quit (as of today, exactly twice). Afterwards is still my strongest craving by far. I didn't even really smoke or make a big thing about it when I did smoke, but out of the last 7 weeks, this has been a strange and significant craving. To the point I'm considering abstaining. But not really.
But maybe...

I've read sex feels better after quitting. I don't have a large pool of comparison. But anyone got anything for this trigger?

Day 18: 1 mile run, Bicep/Shoulder/Ab lift, No Snoozing, No smokes, No drinks

Another night post under the stars as I head back home from my run. So enjoyable:-). Woke this morning and stuck to my goal of just jumping out of bed. Read Reddit while the coffee was brewing and bagel toasting. Had two major smoking cravings today but it made me realize something. For all those times I've heard the advice "just wait 15 minutes" or " go do something to distract yourself" really imo only applies to after you've gotten to a point (i.e. Two weeks or so past quitting). I say this because during the first 0-5 days especially, the addiction is more of a 24 hour yelling beast. Cravings are a constant. I never understand what these people meant by, just go for a run and when you get back - the craving will be gone. Fuck that.

But now, now that it is not an all consuming thought, yes, distracting yourself for a few minutes while the craving occurs, does work. Before you know it, you're back to your strong confident self.  Just my experience but maybe some can relate.

Ramble ramble ramble :-) time to make some tea and relax. Did anyone run/bike/lift/swim? Either way, let's fight this together. I will not smoke or drink with you.  Night world

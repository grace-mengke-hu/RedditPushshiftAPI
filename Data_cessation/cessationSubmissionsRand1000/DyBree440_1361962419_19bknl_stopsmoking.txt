Ok r/stopsmoking, this is it. For the last time, I just finished my last cigarette.

So far, I've failed twice this year after long streaks(25 days then 21 days).  I'm over it. No more excuses.  I'm not going to let stupid stresses like my love life, work, family issues, etc. get in my way.  I know I'm done now.  I'll be honest, when shit went down, that first cigarette felt great... until I threw up.  But I was on a path of self destruction so I didn't care.  Two packs later, I felt like I was starting the cycle all over again.  At that point, I'm done.  I'm never going back to this stupid habit.

This Fire Demon has controlled me for over 18 years.  No more.  Last week I made a promise that I'd be back.  Here I am.  No more nicotine, no more coughing, no more feeling sick to my stomach.  That's it, and this time, it's for good.

I want to thank all of you for your support, posts proving to me that this isn't impossible.  Thank you all for proving to me that there really isn't anything that can get in my way unless I'm stupid enough to let it.  I know I'm human, and I'll make mistakes, but this is one that I NEVER want to make again.  

It's time to breathe again, it's time to taste again, it's time to live life for everything it is, the good, the bad, and everything in between.  I know you're all total strangers to me, but we all share at least one thing in common, our disdain for this horrible addiction.

I'm putting my badge back on.  It's not just a badge marking how long I haven't had a smoke, but it is a badge of Honor and a badge of Bravery.  It is to remind me that I have gone into the fire and defeated the Fire Demon.  With your help, support, and love, I will wear this Badge will pride for the rest of my life.

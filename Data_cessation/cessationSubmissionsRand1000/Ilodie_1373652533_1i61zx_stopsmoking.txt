Pushups for pangs

I'm on day 3 (3 days, 1 hour, 13 minutes!) and I'm actually doing better than I thought. I've thrown a couple of temper tantrums, and screamed out some aggression, but for the most part I'm doing ok.

My thing is I've started doing pushups, or hill climbers, at the office whenever a particularly strong pang comes on. Dropped down in the middle of a brainstorm and did 10 pushups, then got back up and kept going. 

Anybody else do this? Does it work for you?

After 50 hours I relapsed

I was feeling very depressed, I caught myself crying even I had read Allen Carr's book and watched many videos of how to quit smoking. At my first severe craving, I failed. I wasn't feeling anything physical but mentally it was hell. It is very hard to change my daily routine. I believe it's best to talk to my therapist (depression and panic attacks and taking pills) before I try again. Do you agree?

So here's this

I'm on chapter 7 of the book. I came to realize why I had started smoking 21 years ago; and it all has to do with my father, who passed from a heart attack at 52. And yeah, he smoked. Like a chimney. So did mom, by the way, and she went at 59 from COPD and emphysema. You'd think I'd have gotten the memo and quit when they died, 15 years apart. One would think.

I simply wanted to be like my dad. That realization hit me today like a ton of bricks and I about lost it. Kept smoking, though.

I have, over the past six months, been motivated and encouraged to quit. Now I am resolved. It's pretty much a foregone conclusion.

As per instructions I smoke while reading the book. At home, when I smoke, I read more. It is only a matter of time until I finish the book. At the time of this writing I don't have hope, or faith - it's concrete knowledge that when I turn the last page, it will be my last cigarette, and feel that I cannot wait. I guess I do have faith in the author, and his testimonials, supplied both by this subreddit and the author himself. But it's not blind faith. I can almost literally see the light at the end of the tunnel.

It's a fuckin' page-turner, I tell ya.

Today

I have decided to try quitting again today. I'm 22 and started when I was 15. I've been working out lately and I want to be able to push myself without worrying about my lungs. Also, they are $11 a pack where I live and I would love to use that money toward something else. I just wanted to post this on here so someone knows that I'm doing it. Thanks and good luck. :)

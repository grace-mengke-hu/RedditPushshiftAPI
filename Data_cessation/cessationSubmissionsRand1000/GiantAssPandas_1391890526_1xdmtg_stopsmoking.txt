Messed up hard, but it can be done again.

The other night I was at a buddy's house drinking vodka.  And as you would assume, drinking vodka leads to a drunkin' stupor in most cases.  Well.. anyways I went with them to the convenience store so they could get some cigarettes, and something just went off in my head.  I convinced myself that it would be okay to smoke one since I was drunk.  I ended up smoking about ten cigarettes in the course of the night because I was intoxicated and didn't really care about it.  When I woke up in the morning, I had realized what I had done and it completely bummed me out.  Since then I have smoked two cigarettes in the course of two days because I already fucked up, and I can't have this habit return again.  I just wanted to make a note about it here. 53 days without a cigarette before this. Damn...

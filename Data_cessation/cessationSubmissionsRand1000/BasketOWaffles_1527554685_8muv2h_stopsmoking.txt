Looking for patch advice!

Hello everyone in the beautiful subreddit. I love you all, I'm almost at 3 days and I wouldn't have done it without all your responses. I'm motivated non - smoker now! :)

Anyway I'm using the patch for NRT(I like it because I physically can't light up with it on) and it is working really well! The only issue I am having is keeping the damn things on my body. It's summer, I work inside new homes in 30+ degree heat and usually sweat buckets. For the 3 days smoke free I've used at least 6 patches! Is anyone familiar with them and have any tips or tricks to keep them stuck to me? They are just so damn expensive and I'm trying to save money here! :)

Again thank you all for your support. I can't wait until I have some experience of my own, and can give back to the community the same way. Not one puff, not ever!

My Journey, A Description of How Quitting Specifically gets easier over time.

I guess my main purpose in writing this is both to commemorate my 100 days quit, not a single cig, but also my purpose is to specifically attempt to describe how it gets better and easier over time, something that is an abstraction to a smoker. 

I remember being the smoker who sat there like a church goer when I quit with only my blind faith that it would get better and I remember really wanting someone to tell me specifics. Give me real milestones that I can sense with my body in the first person and achieve that are not a year or more away. There are quit smoking benefit timelines that exist but they are all the same and vague.  

Well start with how I feel right now and work our way back. Right now I'm actually on my third beer listening to music on my computer while i write this. 
Immediate things I notice now after 100 days: 


* My back feels great, I used to get this horrible pain in my lumbar that would kinda just web through my whole back, making it feel like I couldn't breath. Since I've quit smoking I no longer get this sensation even after gaming all day at the computer or sitting in the car for a while. 

* THE SEX IS BETTER. I've stated this before but the sex is so much better it's not even funny. You know why? because when you quit you are killing 2 birds with one stone. Not only do you increase your ability to deliver pleasure to your partner, increased stamina, cleaner, generally more confident, but also the sensations YOU feel are vastly improved. Overall one of the better, greatest reasons to quit. 

* The Outdoors. I don't know what it was about being disconnected from the outdoors as a smoker. The loss of sense of smell is huge but it's bigger than that, its like the lack of oxygen over time was depleting ALL my senses. The wind going over my skin feels different. This simile is very much a stretch but it works it was like before I was not being able to enjoy hot water then one day my depth of sensation returned and along with it the pleasure loving it again being sensitive to its movement over my skin. Skin's big for me no one mentioned how different your skin feels when you quit, not just to the touch but actually feels to exist inside of.

* Emotions. This one is weird because I genuinely lost it for few days at one point, not lost it as in lost control of my behavior, but i was just tossing and turning, just deeply unsatisfied within myself just kinda laying there unable to find peace. I'd say the hardest wasn't necessarily the start, even though that was hard it still had the excitement of a new quit to help me. Day 45ish it started to get real. This is forever. The honeymoon period was gone and I had to keep reminding myself why do I feel like shit, and it was because I didn't have the psychological crutch i used for seven years. And the heavy imprint from leaning on it so hard hadn't yet lifted. This psycho/emotional imprint (You know you leave your socks on too long get those marks?) on my mind I really feel has nothing to do with nicotine at all in is a kind of superfluous effect of nicotine addiction and is what really keeps people locked in. A behavioral wiring adhered from repetition initiated by nicotine.  Maybe it's a form of mental illness? I don't I'm getting too deep :). 

Anyway emotion's were everything in this, my lack of satisfaction was why I smoked in the first place. 

This is how it felt to cross from this emotional spectrum to the one I'm at now: 
Imagine if someone touched you so softly, and the pressure with which they applied that touch increased at the rate that hair grows. 
Combine that idea with the idea of having a bucket of water poured over your head everyday from which you must gulp your daily supply of water, to having less buckets, and less inversely replaced with water bottles, until finally all you have is water bottles and you see the ridiculousness of the buckets. 


This is how your Idle Happiness, to be running quiet and smoothly like a well maintained car can idle, returns to you. Slowly, very very slowly but it's always healing slowly over time and you WILL GET THERE. :).

I'm not trying to be avant-garde or out there at all with this but I really wanted to pinpoint a sensation of experience. The actual sensation of the experience of quitting smoking so that those of you with less days can stop staring into the dark and wondering if it gets better. It does. :). Keep it up.

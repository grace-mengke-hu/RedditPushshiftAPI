Now I'm loving the ecigs - OH NO.

The reason I say "OH NO"?  Because now I don't wanna give up the ecigs lol.  The plan was to be just temporarily using them for NRT and wean off to nothing by the end of the month.  Now I'm really enjoying them, so it's like I've just traded one vice for the other. :( UGH!

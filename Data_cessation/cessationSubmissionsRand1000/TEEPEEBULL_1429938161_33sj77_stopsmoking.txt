300 Days does not Equal Day 1 x 300

Crossing the 300 day line and thinking back a bit on the beginning of all of this. It seems somewhat odd that people look at higher amounts of days away from smokes as being a greater accomplishment. 

Day 1 to day 2 is the most important day. Hands down. Anybody gets past day 1,... that's a lot harder and takes much more effort that going from day 299 to day 300. Or from day 1199 to day 1200.

Anyhoo, that's what I was thinking about today as day 300 crossed by. It's pretty easy right now to go smoke free all day. But the props belong to the day 1 people. and the first week survivors, I am one. And I don't forget.

Get out of the addiction.....it kills! PERIOD

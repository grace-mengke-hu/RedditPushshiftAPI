A Thousand Days

The best thing about quitting, I think, is the freedom. If I'm tired, I just go to bed because I don't have to worry about whether I have enough cigarettes to get me through the night or next morning. I don't care whose car we're taking because I'm not going to want a smoke during the ride. I can just stay inside the restaurant or bar if the weather is bad because I don't have to go outside since I won't need a cigarette. I don't worry about the way cigarettes make me look or smell, the toll they take on my health, or the hit in my finances. None of that is a factor in my day-to-day.

Also, I really appreciate you guys who've helped me along the way. Also, I hope that those of you just starting out keep at it. It really is amazing.

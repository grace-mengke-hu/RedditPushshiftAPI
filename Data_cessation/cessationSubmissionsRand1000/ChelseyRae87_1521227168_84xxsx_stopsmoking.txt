Help!

My sister is having a party for her 30th which obviously i have to attend, but everyone will be drinking and smoking and I'm nervous. I don't want to drink because i rarely do so and when i do, i chain smoke. I also don't want to dissapoint her by not participating fully. Everyone will be drinking and smoking and I'll be off in a corner super uncomfortable which will make me want to smoke even more regardless of if i drink or not. I'm doing great in my quit. Day 12. I've been avoiding triggers like hanging with smokers or drinking or whatever, and now I'm going to get slapped in the face with triggers. 
Honestly... I want to stay home, but i live next door lol. I can't avoid this. Please help me. I need perspective and advice and tips.... All of it.

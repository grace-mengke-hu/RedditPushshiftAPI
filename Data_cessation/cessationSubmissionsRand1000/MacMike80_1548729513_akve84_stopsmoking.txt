Day 28

Stayed home from work today due to getting about 13” of snow dumped on us.  Only had cravings when I was watching The Godfather and one of the characters lit up.  Then I kept thinking “aw, man- this movie was made back in the ‘70’s; I hope none of these guys got really hooked on smoking for this role.”  Going to bed.  Day 28 is done!!

My stupid brain is craving a new addiction...

I'm hitting 26 days smoke free today and I don't miss smoking! The problem is that I (apparently) have an addiction to addiction. I started eating as a substitute... Then freaking about weight gain and obsessively working out... Then freaking about falling into old eating disorder habits and trying to focus my energy on cleaning... Then having to stop myself from scrubbing my knuckles off and ending up in a complete panic attack. I feel like I need to be doing something. Like I need to be totally immersed in something to replace smoking.

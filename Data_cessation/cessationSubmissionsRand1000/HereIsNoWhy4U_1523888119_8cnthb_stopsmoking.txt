Treat yo-self!

If you're having trouble motivating yourself to *stay* smoke-free, try treating yourself to something every week. For example, I'd write a list of things I want in the coming month and then each week I didn't smoke I'd buy something off that list. 

It could be a video-game, some expensive sushi or whatever really. It could also be something way more fancy if you for e.g. save a lot by not smoking!

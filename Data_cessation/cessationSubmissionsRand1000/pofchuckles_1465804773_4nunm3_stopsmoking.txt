2 hours away from 7 days

Over the last week I have used this thread a lot and have posted every day which has helped me a lot. I smoked for 8 maybe 9 years (I'm not sure which) and during 2010-2014 I quit so many times. Dozens of times I quit for 3 days about 10 times between 4-10 days and three times 11-25 days...The reason I crumbled? Booze. I was living in the UK and now i'm in Canada and even though Canadians disagree your drinking culture is not even 1/4th of what it is in the UK. I drink like 90% less here and that's a good thing so I realized a few weeks ago I gave up because I wouldn't have a social life but here if I give up I can play football sorry soccer again go to drop in hockey,touch rugby get my bike pass like my snowboarding pass because I don't drink anymore! So last Sunday I decided i'd wake up and just see how long I could go and work from there. Well it's been a week and I always said next time I go a week again that will be it. I know I still got two months left and I shall continue posting everyday but I think with some more help here I can get there. Things to note I was not expecting the Insomnia as before when I quit it was fatigue! I had headaches for 4 days until today but my girlfriend made brownies because she's nice. Day 3 in the night was always as hard as day 3 always is. The first 5 hours of day 1 is underestimated future quiters get passed day and 3 and with a slight kick up the arse getting to a week is fine!. Also I went out Fridat night to a bar and didn't drink and afterwards at 1230am I went to a friends to watch the NEW Zealand rugby game and he smoked 5 around me and I did not crumble :)

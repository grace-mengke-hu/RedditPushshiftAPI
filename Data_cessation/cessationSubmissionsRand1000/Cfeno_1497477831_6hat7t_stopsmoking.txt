Help! Hitting 3 months

I see a personal trainer and she was naturally delighted when I told her I quit smoking (I didn't tell her until about a month in). After about a month it was clear I had put on weight (as I replaced cigarettes with food) but also that I had a lot more energy in the gym. Now I've put on even more weight, I've lost the energy in the gym and have got even fatter. I cried this morning as it seems so unfair that I'm being punished for taking such a positive step in my life. Told my PT the same but she rightly said I can't replace one bad habit with another: maybe this is why the three month thing others mentioned exists?

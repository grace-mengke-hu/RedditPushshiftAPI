Relapse Advice

Any tips on getting back on track after a two week relapse?  Quit cold turkey for about a month and have been smoking on and off for the past two weeks.  I’m not smoking nearly as much as I use to but I’m still smoking none-the-less.  Ultimately I should have quit again immediately after that initial cigarette, but unfortunately that wasn’t the case and here I am fearing going the withdrawal all over again.   At this point I guess I can find solace in the fact that I now know what to expect, I’ve done it before, and I can do it again.

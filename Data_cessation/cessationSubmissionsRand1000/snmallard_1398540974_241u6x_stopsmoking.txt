Noticing I started blacking out when drinking...?

It's almost been a month since I had my last cigarette. I noticed that the last two times I drank, I get drunk faster and even blacked out. The only thing that's changed is that I'm not smoking cigarettes when I drink now so I was wondering if there's a correlation or if anyone has experienced this as well. It's a huge problem and I'm going to stop drinking all together. I'm on the patch (second stage so 14mg) so it's not like I have nicotine completely out of my system yet.

Any knowledge of this or advice?

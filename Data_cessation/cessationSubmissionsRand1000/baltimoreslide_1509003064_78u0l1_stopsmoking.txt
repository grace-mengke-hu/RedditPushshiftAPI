Apps?

Hi guys. Screw smoking!  
I'd like to install an app to track my progress, but what I have is:  
- An iphone 4 with original OS  
- A Lenovo Chromebook computer  

I can't find a quit smoking app that runs on either of these. Can anyone help me out?  
I'm done smoking FOREVER. But it'd be nice to have a motivational reminder I could look up once in a while.  
Thanks and rock on, quitters!

Overcoming one of the biggest hurdle so far..

Recently, I went on a vacation to another country. It's cigarettes were significantly cheaper than home. Most of my relatives, whom I went with, took advantage of this and started smoking like crazy hell they were chain-smoking even. Of course, they had their own exclusive club. 

I was so tempted to smoke. It was cheap and I would "fit in". I actually considered breaking my streak for 5 minutes of craving relief. I considered walking to a nearby store and getting one. Heck I even considered getting a cigar. It was bad. But here's what I realised:

I can join them and smoke now but will they be there once I pick up smoking again? Will the club still be there when I come back home? Eventually, the addiction journey will be something I go through alone and nobody is at fault except me. It was all temporary. I reminded myself this. When I get home, i will not have to go through this again so I just have to hold on till then. 

Fortunately, I went through the vacation still smoke-free. I still have another vacation which lasts for a week and yet another country which has cheap cigarettes.. (or maybe where I live just sells exorbitant cigarettes) I hope I can continue fighting it. I just have to hold on till the vacation ends then I think I will truly be free. 

Thanks for reading!

Tldr: fight off the urge to smoke in a country that sells cheap cigarettes and proud of myself

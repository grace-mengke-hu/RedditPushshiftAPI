Two Weeks Today--What I Have Learned

So after two weeks of no smoking, there have been ups and downs (but mostly ups):

Ups:
-Money saved and health increased, of course.
-Living without the stench is wonderful.
-Cravings have significantly subsided to the point where I laugh at my brain trying to convince me to buy a pack.
-I can officially call myself a "non-smoker" without feeling ashamed. No more hiding the secret, or changing my clothes constantly, or dousing myself is sprays or cologne to hide.
-My skin and teeth feel improved. I was quite stressed before I quit but now even the bags under my eyes have definitely been reduced. 
-I can run 5km faster than I ever have before, and my times get better with each run.
-Most importantly for me, I've received the confidence now to ask out this wonderful woman I've been crushing on for a while because I knew she would refuse a disgusting smoker (most exceptional women do)

Downs:
-Endless stream of mucous/phlegm coughed up. I hear this stuff is normal. But I'm also going to the doctor today for fear of a throat/lung infection.
-Refusing to socialize with other smokers; although I feel strong enough to say "no" to them, I also don't feel the urge to hang out with smokers anymore--the changes I've made to my life don't gibe with them anymore.
-Sensations of boredom and being unfulfilled--I'm still looking for things to replace smoking time with successfully.


To anyone just beginning: you can do it! Patches and gums and meds can help, but nothing is more powerful than self-discipline. Each day that passes only adds to your sense of self-worth and self-value...coming from a guy who struggled with depressive episodes and low confidence, you need to trust me. Keep it up, all of you !!!

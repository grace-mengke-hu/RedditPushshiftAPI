A word of caution

There are those moments that you learn that your no-longer-working co-worker which you didn't like because only you could see past his fake-face gets the credit for doing entirerly yours few-hour hard work, and you cannot do anything about it.

If that happens, resist the urge to smoke!!!

At least i did :)

Stay strong and have a nice day.

PS: Anyone searching for IT Expert at their company? :)

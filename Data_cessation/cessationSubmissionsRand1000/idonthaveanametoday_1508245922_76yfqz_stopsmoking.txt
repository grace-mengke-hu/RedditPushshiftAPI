Anyone have new symptoms after a month in? Crazy bloating

I've quit many times before but this time I'm 40 days in so things are looking so far ( excuse the badge I have to update it)

I'm still having dizziness issues, and random pain but I think it has to do with getting more oxygen. One issue though that it crazy is severe bloating. Generally I know this happens in the beginning but I'm wondering why I'm feeling it more now 5 weeks in. I workout, eat healthy, drink water, eat fiber , etc. Also still having crazy anxiety any ideas?

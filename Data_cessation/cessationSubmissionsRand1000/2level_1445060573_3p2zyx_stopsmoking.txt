Getting a star is so important!

After 30 days, the positives are overwhelming. Then it is just a matter of attitude. Another redditor wrote:"After 40 days your former addiction is as over as you want it to be"   

Who cares if you got cravings from time to time? As a smoker everyday I had cravings,  the first thing I did after work was lighting up because I had been craving a cig.     

People do not relapse because it is difficult to stay clean, ok, there can be a strong trigger but most of the time it is easy and better!
People relapse because they think they have beaten addiction or because they  are in grief or despair but do not remember that smoking does not help in any way.
Somebody said that all it takes to avoid relapse is thinking of enjoying comfortable probation for life.

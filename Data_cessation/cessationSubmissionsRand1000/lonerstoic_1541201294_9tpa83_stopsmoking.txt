Need A *Good* Reason To Quit

All smokers know that smoking causes serious health problems.  But they also know they won't drop dead today.  So they keep smoking.  Some just want one more, and one more.

Then there's the expense.  Well, it's only $7 a pack, and while it's maybe $30,000 in 10 years, it's not $30,000 in one fell swoop.  So it doesn't feel expensive.

Are there any \*cooler\* reasons to quit?  Any emotional reasons?  Something that will get me motivated?  Perhaps selfish reasons?

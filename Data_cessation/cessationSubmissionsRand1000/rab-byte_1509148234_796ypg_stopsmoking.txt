Day 8

Felt confident all day
So confident my addicted monkey brain started teasing me, nudging me, whispering things to me like. “You clearly aren’t addicted to tobacco. You’ve managed to go a whole week without smoking. Hell you could smoke right now and still not have to smoke again. It would feel so good smoking after this long”

I literally had an argument with myself. I called me out on my bullshit and didn’t smoke. 

Damn!

My brain is evil and is clearly plotting against me

But I know mind’s it’s tricks and will stay vigilant

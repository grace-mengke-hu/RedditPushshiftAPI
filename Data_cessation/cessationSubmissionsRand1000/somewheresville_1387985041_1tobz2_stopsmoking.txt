Coughing after almost a year of not smoking.

In the last couple of weeks I've started coughing up gunk again like I did when I first quit smoking almost a year ago. Has anyone else experienced this second round of lung clearing? 

I would think that I was coming down with something but I don't feel sick in any other way.

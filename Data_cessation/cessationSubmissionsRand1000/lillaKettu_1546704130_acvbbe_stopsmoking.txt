One week

Hi ! 
I thought I would share how my first week went!
From smoking 1 pack a day I quit cold turkey and now a week has passed so I'm a little proud of that !
I also started going for long walks everyday and I chose to not  replace my habit with eating .
I also quit drinking , I wasn't a big drinker but I used to smoke a lot while drinking 1-2 here and there so I'm just avoiding situations that could be triggering . 
I think I've been lucky to not have too many cravings and I've been feeling great ( expect in the morning with a little bit of cough and difficulty breathing) 
I've also kept busy with my work ( entrepreneur ) and playing games. 
I guess I'm mostly afraid of a negative situation out of my control and unexpected, I'm not sure how I would react . But I shall not focus on that too much 
How are you all doing ?

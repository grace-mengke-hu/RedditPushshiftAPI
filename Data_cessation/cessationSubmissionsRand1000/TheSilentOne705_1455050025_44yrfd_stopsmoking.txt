It's been one week since...

Well, actually 9 days and some change, but yeah. Over a week now, and I had:

 - A migraine
 - Nausea
 - Coughing up the brown junk
 - Gained about 5 lbs
 - Getting very hungry from time to time
 - Hating clients a little bit
 - Cussing in traffic (that one's not really new, though)
 - Lack of energy/lassitude

Still, almost 2 weeks in and it should slowly go up from here. Thinking about going to somewhere interesting in my new home city since I haven't explored much.

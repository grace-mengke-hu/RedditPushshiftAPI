Watching Mad Men, which I've been avoiding, because I know they show a lot of smoking, and...

nothing, really.  It just looks dated. All the smoke filled rooms look disgusting and they aren't really glamorizing smoking so far, just admitting that it's everywhere.  It just seems weird to see them so often but that  really is how it was.

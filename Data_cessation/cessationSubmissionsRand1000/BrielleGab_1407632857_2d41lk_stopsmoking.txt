Day 60!

Just looked and wow! Look how far I've come! I'm so proud of myself, and just wanted to share my joy and encourage you all on your journey!

Whether you are in the first days, a few weeks in,  or just thinking about it- I have faith in your abilities and know that you have the capability to overcome the nicotine demon! 

Be strong!

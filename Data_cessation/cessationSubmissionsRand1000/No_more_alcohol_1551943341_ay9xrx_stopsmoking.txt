5 days without toxic poisoning smoke

I have completed five days with smoke filling my lungs with black poison clogging my arteries. I don't want heart disease, I don't want my leg chopped off from infected blood stream, I don't want to have a hole in my throat to breath from throat cancer. All I want to breath is air. Oxygen the good stuff and be healthy again.

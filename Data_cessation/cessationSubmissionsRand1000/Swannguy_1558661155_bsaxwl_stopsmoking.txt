The Patch &amp; Inhaler

Anyone here had experience with trying to quit smoking while using Zyban, the patch &amp; a nicotine inhaler?. Is this all just delaying the inevitable cravings or is it a good first step? 
It’s now been 5 days without a cigarette, but I’m using the inhaler a lot &amp; realizing it basically mimics smoking a cigarette.

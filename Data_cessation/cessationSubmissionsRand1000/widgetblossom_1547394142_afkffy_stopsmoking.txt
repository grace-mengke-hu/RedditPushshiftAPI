I stopped myself from smoking just now

I was up early this morning. My husband was still in bed. I was on my way out the door to go get coffee, when I saw my husband's open pack of cigarettes. 

"Just one," I thought.

"No," I argued with myself. 

I decided I definitely wasn't going to smoke one. But . . . I just wanted to look at them. Carefully, without touching the pack, I peaked into the crack where the pack was left open. There were about 6 in there. I'm such an addict. 

I just left the house to go get coffee. Not smoking today.

He's going to have to not leave those out anymore. Too much temptation. It's a good thing he doesn't smoke my brand, because I don't think I could have resisted.

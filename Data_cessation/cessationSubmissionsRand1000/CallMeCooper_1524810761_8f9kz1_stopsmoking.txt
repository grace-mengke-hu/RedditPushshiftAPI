I'm scared I might relapse today

Hi everyone, I thought maybe typing this all out might help me stay on the right path today.
I quit over a month ago and haven't had a single puff since! I'm so happy about it, and recently the cravings have been almost non-existent. But today I'm kind of scared of the possibly relapsing...

Today is a big national holiday where I'm from, King's Day in the Netherlands. Everyone is out on the street celebrating, dancing and drinking. Now, I've had a few drinks since I quit and it was fine, but I'm not sure how I'll respond today. 

I'm going to try to stay on the safe (meaning not-drunk) side, but I'll be with my friend who's VERY excited about partying, getting drunk, and smoking a lot. She's been supportive of my quit but I know deep down she wishes I hadn't quit, because it makes her feel guilty about still being a smoker. So I know that when she gets drunk, there's a chance she might offer me cigarettes. And if I'm drunk too, I have no idea how I'll respond. 

So I guess this post is just me trying to get in the right headspace to stay strong and smart today, to have fun in a way that I won't hate myself afterwards. 

Have you guys gone through any big parties or celebrations since your quit? How did you handle it?

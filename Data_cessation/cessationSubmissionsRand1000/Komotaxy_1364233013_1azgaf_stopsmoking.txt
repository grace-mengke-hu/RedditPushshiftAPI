Hey everybody. Any tips for the pre-quit stage?

I've tried quitting many, many times. There's always an excuse I find to smoke, whether it be stressing over a disappointment, or life just happening.

My nicotine patches will arrive tomorrow, so my last cigarette will be on Tuesday night. I've been planning on quitting for the past month or so. I've steadily dropped down from full flavor cigarettes to mediums, to lights, and now I'm on ultra-lights.

Is there anything else I should keep in mind before my quit date? Any tips?

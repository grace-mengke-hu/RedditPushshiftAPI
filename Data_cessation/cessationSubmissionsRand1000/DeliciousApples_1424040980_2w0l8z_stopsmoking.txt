Day one almost done

I posted here the other day. It wasn't amazing because I guess a lot of you are about tough love and I needed support from people in similar situations so I deleted my thread. Then yesterday my friend died of cancer, the doctors think it's a direct result  of smoking her whole life. Who knows, but it can't have helped. She left behind 3 kids, the youngest being 7. 

She and one of my best friends got their heads shaved for macmillan cancer last year and raised loads. So if I can't do this for myself then i need to do it for her, and my son. So here i am. End of day one with  no smoking.

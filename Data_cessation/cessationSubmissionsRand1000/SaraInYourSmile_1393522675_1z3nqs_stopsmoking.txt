Day 2 and I'm feeling pretty positive!

I'm really feeling great today! I've been perusing the forum and commenting as much as possible on other people's posts, because reading them and all the replies is really pumping me up! I think it's so wonderful that everyone on here is supportive and offers so many different pieces of advice and encouragement.

Last night was a little rough for me.  My roommates are both smokers and they were having a great time laughing in the backyard, but I stayed in my room and waited it out.  By the time I went to sleep, I felt so proud of myself, and when I woke up this morning, I woke up with a smile! I'm having a little trouble breathing today though, has anyone else experienced that?

My SO seemed pretty inspired by my will to quit and my positive attitude about it, so he's decided to try as well (though I didn't ask him to because I think that needs to be a decision someone makes for themselves).  He seems really interested in all the apps I've been using as well as the forum, so maybe we can both do this together :)

Again, thank you all for your encouragement and support not just of me, but of everyone on this sub.  You're truly making a difference in people's lives, and I think that's so neat!

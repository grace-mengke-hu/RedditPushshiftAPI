I’ve successfully cut down to 1-2 cigarettes a day. Scared to make the leap

Well guys it’s been a while since I posted.  Over the last year I’ve been trying to quit a 15 year half pack-pack a day habit.  I tried the gum with varying degrees of success, as well as cold turkey, ranging from a few days to over a week smoke free.  

Now I’m living with my fiancée and she convinced me to cut down instead of abruptly stopping.  So I was able to begin smoking just 3-4 cigarettes a day to 3, to 2, and now I can go every day smoking 1-2 cigarettes.  If I have a piece of nicotine gum in the afternoon I can go until the evening until having one.  

I’m so close to quitting, but making the leap to none is scaring me.  I am finally able to leave the house without smokes, and I can wake up without having one right away.  Some days I even go a full 24 hours without having one.   It’s now been almost 7 weeks since I’ve been having just 1-2 a day.

Has anyone else done this method?  I know some people say that cutting down is impossible, but I’m in a situation right now where I literally cannot smoke more, not only would I likely feel sick and guilty, but my fiancée would be furious.  She is pregnant and I promised her and myself I would quit before she has the baby.

I’m thinking of just starting with the nicotine gum only, a few pieces a day since I’m already getting a minimal amount of nicotine.  I need to do this guys, for myself, for my fiancée, and our future child.  Any tips, support or advice would be much appreciated 

Thank you

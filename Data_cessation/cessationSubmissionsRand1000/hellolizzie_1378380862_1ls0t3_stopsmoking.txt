About to turn 30 and haven't smoked in 10 months now!

Hi everyone, it's my 30th birthday on Monday and I'm pleased to say I haven't had a single cigarette in 10 months now. I always knew I wanted to quit when I turned 30 because that's when they say you can regain your health from, but I am really delighted to already consider myself a non-smoker. It's been a really challenging 10 months and I almost gave up plenty of times in times of stress and despair, but I'm glad that I kept at it.

Just wanted to say keep it up everyone, and thanks for all your support. My phone app says I've saved over Â£1000 so gonna buy myself a nice 30th birthday present as a reward. Can't wait to reach 1 year now!!

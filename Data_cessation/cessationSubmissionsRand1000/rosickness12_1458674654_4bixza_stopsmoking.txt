When did you realize you officially kicked the habit?

For close to 3 years now I've made progress.  Each quarter year included less smokes then the last.  I've never been an avid smoker like people I know.  The average was 4 smokes a day.  It's never been a problem to quit for a week.  During the last year I'd smoke maybe two a week.  I'm 32 and started at 15.  This 23 day period I'm on now is probably the longest I've went without a smoke and for some reason the cravings have kicked in hard.  You'd think that would happen on week one or two.  Not on the 4th week.  When does this massive craving go away?  Or am I just thinking in terms of "hey, you went this long.  Treat yourself."

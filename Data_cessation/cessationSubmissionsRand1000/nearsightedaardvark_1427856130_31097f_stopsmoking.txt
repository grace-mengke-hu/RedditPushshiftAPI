Just when I thought I was out, Christian Slater pulls me right back in...

So, last night, I watched Heathers and saw Christian Slater looking foine smoking. No big deal. My mouth watered a little bit, but I shook it off. Then tonight, I decided to watch Pump Up the Volume and I forgot that he smokes in that film, too. And that tipped me over the edge. The eighties and nineties made smoking look very sexy. Does anyone have any "anti-inspiration" for me? Ya know, smoking characters that made smoking look anything but sexy?

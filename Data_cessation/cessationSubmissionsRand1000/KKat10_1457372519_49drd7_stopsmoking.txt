HUGE Victory this Weekend!

So damn proud of myself I had to share.  I live in Chicago where there is no smoking anywhere, and went to Indiana to visit some friends for the weekend, where they still allow smoking in some places.  I met up with people at a smoking bar, and guess who didn't have even one cigarette? ME! Broke out the ecig for a bit just to stay strong at a couple of weak moments, but made it through!  Funny how when I walked in, the place just smelled horrible and my clothes and hair REEKED the next day.  I've never been a non-smoker in a smoking bar.  What a wake-up call.  Anyway - woot!

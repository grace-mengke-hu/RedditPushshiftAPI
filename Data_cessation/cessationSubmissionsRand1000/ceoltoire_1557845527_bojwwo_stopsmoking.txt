Summer days...

They're big triggers for me. I associate smoking at this time of year with relaxation and having fun. Anybody else experience this?

I also miss skipping lunch to just have a tea and a smoke... now I can't stop thinking about food. I used to run 4/5 days a week anyway, but now I'm in the gym 7 days a week to avoid gaining weight. I'm pretty tired I won't lie. I feel like it's too much for me but I seriously don't want to gain..

Thanks to this sub - you're helping me so much.

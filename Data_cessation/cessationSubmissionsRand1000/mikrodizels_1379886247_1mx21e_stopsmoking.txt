Almost day 5. The food tastes and smells way better :)

Holy crap. My apetite has increased by A LOT. I love it.  
I ate so much food today and i am so happy that it actually tastes like it should after 7 years. I have always been a typical, ''skinny white-boy'', but now, hopefully i will put on some body weight. The most amazing thing is, i don't crave the ''after meal cig'' at all.

Day 23 complete

No major cravings. Probably once every two days or so and they are not strong. Nevertheless, I have to be on guard. Newbies who are reading this, let me tell you that time will pass by very quickly. I myself am surprised that 23 days have gone by already. All you have to do is to not to smoke again. See you all again on Day 26. Thanks for reading.

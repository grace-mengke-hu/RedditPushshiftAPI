Went to a bar last night

A friend of mine is in a band so my fiance and I went to the bar he was playing at last night.  They allow smoking inside this establishment, so I was a bit worried about cravings, but my fiance promised to take me out for ice cream if the bar scene got too stressful.  :D

The first thing I noticed was the nasty smell.  I can't believe how shitty it stank in there. Then my eyes watered.  I had smoke being blown in my face (on accident), but I was able to hang out for about an hour before I needed to leave.

I was very relieved to have not had a single craving the entire time I was there.

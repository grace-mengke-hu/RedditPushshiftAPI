Alright guys and gals, help me make it for real

How can I make what I have left, the end? I want to quit, I want to be done. I can't afford patches although I wish I could. From past experiences they have worked the best. I can fight past the habitual craving but how can I fight the nicotine? I don't want to be a smoker anymore. I need strong support from people who know what I'm going through, or will be going through.

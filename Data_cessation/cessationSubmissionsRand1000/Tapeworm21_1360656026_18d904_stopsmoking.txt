Anyone ever used a bad sickness to quit cold turkey?

Background:  I quit with the patch after 7 years of smoking.  Then 3 years later I went back to smoking over some drama going on in my life.  

Skip forward to present, I always wanted to quit cold turkey.  The man's way!  Last week I got the flu really bad, puking my guts out, can't get out of bed, bowels that would even creep out r/spacedicks.  It was terrible.  I was finally able to return to work today.  Three days no smokes, lets try and do a full work day without having one.  So here I am on day 4!  Smoke free!  So stoked!

QSPT (quit smoking pro tip): do not under any circumstances go to ikea when you are in nicotine withdrawal. And definitely do not try to sign up for IKEA family discounts using one of their annoying in-store kiosks either.

Stepped down off the last patch last week (woohoo! No more patches or NRT!) and while I’m not wanting a cig per se, I’m in that last bit of nicotine withdrawal rage.... let’s just say everyone at IKEA is wondering why I’m yelling at the g.d. kiosk hahaha 😂😂😁

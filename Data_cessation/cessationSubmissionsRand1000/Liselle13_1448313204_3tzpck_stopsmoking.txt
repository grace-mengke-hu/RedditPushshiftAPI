Today, no matter what, I will not smoke...

Offer on house came late last night...accepted offer and finalized the purchase agreement today. Only things that remain is the inspection this week...and if they are still good with the house after inspection...closing in a couple months.

The good news...the apprehension over whether it will fall thru...so much happening so fast...by now I would've smoked 4 or 5 times today...with a few more later.

But today, no matter want happens...no matter how good or bad the day is...I will not smoke.

This is a bitch.  But I can be a bigger bitch - haha - and say no to something that's just a habit and doesn't even help and will make my cough a million times worse.  So here I am, being a bitch to the stupid addiction ;)

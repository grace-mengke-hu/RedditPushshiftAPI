Choice is empowering

Hi all - been busy with life but my counter is accurate-  been 6 + weeks smoke free!! So here's a cool thought process I had tonight.  I was reflecting on today, and how even though my #1 trigger was happening today, and there were a few times today I wished I could go have a smoke, but I did not smoke.  I cycled through the thoughts that help me to stay on the path, and then I moved on with my day.  It wasn't easy, but it wasn't a struggle either.  I don't get over confident, cuz THAT is dangerous, but looking back, I can carefully conclude that the phrase "i got this" applies today.

As I'm thinking I start trivializing what I accomplished - not smoking today - on the basis that it wasn't a struggle.  I was thinking that it's not all that important because it wasn't a struggle.  

Then the cool thought: I made a choice to not smoke...and I made that choice a few different times today.  And THAT CHOICE...that choice is empowering.  I could've smoked.  But I made a different choice.  I feel empowered by that.

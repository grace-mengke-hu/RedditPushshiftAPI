A huge milestone

Been quit for just over a month. Even more important: I stayed quit during a visit home to see/help my mother and grandmother. In the past such visits have resulted in relapse: Mom has MS and seizures. Grandma is bedridden with Parkinson's. These visits are full of stress and heartache. 

But . . . I didn't smoke. And it's not like I was any less effective as a son and helper without smokes. In fact I felt more in control of myself and my surroundings this time. You *can* go through these darker patches in life without nicotine. Trust me.

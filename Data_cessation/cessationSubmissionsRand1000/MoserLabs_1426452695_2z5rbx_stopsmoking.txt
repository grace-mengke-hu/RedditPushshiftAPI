Sleep / naps?

I've been lurking on here, mostly cause I've quit but can't remember exactly when (tried the first of the year but was "sneaking smokes" between patch changes...)  All in all I think i'm in 2 months (~ Jan 10th).  

I've noticed that when I went to sleep that before (on the patch) I would go right to sleep.  Of course have wicked dreams, which is what I love so much about the patches....

I stopped using the patches back on Thursday and now I have a hard   time falling asleep at night.  Is this normal?

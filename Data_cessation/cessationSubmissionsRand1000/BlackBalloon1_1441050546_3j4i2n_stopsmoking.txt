Almost 5 Days...Things that have been helping me

-I have some Nicorette on hand from previous attempts at quitting, but I have only been using it for those excruciating cravings in the early days. So I have only used a handful of pieces.  
-I have been using lavender roll-on on my temples and wrists and giving self massages along with deep breathing.  
-Most importantly I find that getting enough sleep at night is immensely helpful. I've been using the Sleep Cycle app to monitor my sleep. It's a pretty cool app.  
-Another app I'm using is the Smoke Free app. I upgraded to receive all the missions but I only do them if I feel like they will help me.  
-I'm being gentle with myself...not doing things that cause me too much stress, and rewarding my efforts. I'm taking good care of my body right now with sleeping, being active, drinking water and eating some healthy foods.  
  
These are just a few of the things that are helping me with this quit. 

I am nervous about going back to work tomorrow, so I am going to have to come up with a plan to handle that. I've been trying to minimize my stress levels and it's been helping, but when I get to work it can't be avoided...Any advice?

45 days cold turkey. I just want to thank my (44 days) past self who did not give up in spite of all the irritation, anger, depression, restless, anxiety. I'm getting better. Past few days were not really great but I'm happy that I'm not trying to make these ups and downs of life a reason to smoke.

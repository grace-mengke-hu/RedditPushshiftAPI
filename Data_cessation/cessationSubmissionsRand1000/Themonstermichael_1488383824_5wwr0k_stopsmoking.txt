Yay!

Haven't had a cigarette in 16 days. I started vaping instead. I know vaping isn't exactly healthy either, but I can feel myself breathing much better nowadays. And I'm pretty sure I'm getting better sleep too. And at this point, Even though I've spent about $150 or so on vaping, I probably already saved money not buying a pack every two days. I have only optimism left.

Day 2

Most people I talked to didn't consider me a heavy smoker since I only smoked at most 4 cigs a day and to be honest with you I kind of dont want to completely stop smoking. I'd like to be able to just have a cig or 2 when out drinking, but I realize that this is just rationalization and bs. Got some nicotine lozenges, that I think has been helping. Anyway this is day 2.

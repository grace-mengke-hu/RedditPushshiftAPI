Made it to 100 days!

I quit cold turkey March 20th after smoking about a pack a day for a decade. I was out of smokes one morning and decided to give it a shot, knowing that I couldn't smoke forever and the sooner I quit, the better. Family was another big motivation for me. My dad is in poor health due partly to smoking for over 45 years. I didn't want to end up like him, so that factored into it as well.

The first week was tough, but I stuck it out. After the cravings subsided, I had dreams about smoking. Those dreams kind of stopped recently. I can breathe better now, my clothes smell better, and overall I feel better about myself. I have gained weight but I think that's from filling in the void with food and drink.

Next stop....quitting drinking. Haven't had one in a week, so maybe I can follow through with this too.

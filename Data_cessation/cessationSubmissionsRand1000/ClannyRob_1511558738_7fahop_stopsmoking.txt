Just venting

I've been trying to quit smoking. I read alen carr it makes sense to me, and i know all the advantages of quitting and disadvantages of not quitting. 

But for some reason, even though i've had no problem quitting other vices and addictions, like weed and alcohol i can't quit smoking. 

The thing is i don't think i want to quit. I feel stupid for it but i like that i have something that i look forward too when things are boring, even though i only like it because i've been conditioned to like it. I like to smoke even though i know i'm just doing it because the last cigarette left me in withdrawal. The up and down feeling is pleasing to me because the fact that i feel bad makes the 'high' that much better. It's a psychological mindfuck but i enjoy it. I think thats why even after years of wanting to quit i don't really want to quit.

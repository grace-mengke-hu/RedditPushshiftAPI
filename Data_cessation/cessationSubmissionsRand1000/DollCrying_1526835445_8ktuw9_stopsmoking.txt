Just had a mini cigar.

Not proud of myself.

Don't usually smoke cigars. They are also disgusting. But I knew they were a safer option than buying a pack of cigarettes and I'm kind of in a bad way.

I can forgive myself this. But I don't smoke. There will be no smoking tomorrow or for the rest of today.

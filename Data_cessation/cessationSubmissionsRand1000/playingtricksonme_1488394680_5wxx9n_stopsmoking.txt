32 days and I need some support

I've had mental health issues and I'm medicated now. The medication makes me slower. Well, I just got a project at work that requires me to learn something really complex very quickly. All I can think about is going and getting some cigarettes. It's been 32 days quit though. Ahhhh help me!

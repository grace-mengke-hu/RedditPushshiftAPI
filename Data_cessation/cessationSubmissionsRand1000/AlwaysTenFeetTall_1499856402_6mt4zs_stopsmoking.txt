5+ years... you can do it too!

Never lose hope, always keep trying. It took me years and 6+ attempts before I was able to successfully quit and now I haven't had a smoke in more than five years.

In that time I have saved more than $10,000 by not smoking and ran an ultra-marathon, three road marathons, two trail marathons, and have become an avid hiker.

Go for it. Do it. Never give up.

Three years of freedom!

After trying and failing many times over the years, I FINALLY quit smoking for good three years ago today.

I celebrated the anniversary with a 19 mile run.

Just a reminder to keep on trying. It is possible. You will get there and damn life is now so sweet without the constant pull of nicotine withdrawal pulling you down.

Go for it. You got this.

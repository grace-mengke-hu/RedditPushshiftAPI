2 Months and 1 day! But...

Ex smoker. 10 years I smoked. I realized I had to stop checking in this sub so much. I found that checking in every day after a while kept my mind on cigarettes too often. This is the first time in weeks I've been back here. This may not be the case for everyone but after a while I just had to not even put my mind there.

At 2 months I still crave but it's not the burning desire it was in the first week. Happens at least once every day. I just think of it in the habit way. Sometimes when I get stressed but I am so done with smoking it is not even worth it to me any more. Relaxing breaths do the trick! (I sometimes still put my two fingers up to my mouth like I was taking a drag then exhale accordingly. Still strangely helps.)

I now have a job that I wouldn't have been able to have if I were a smoker. I have TONS of extra money that I have been saving for Disneyland this year and Disney World next year! (YAY)

I have had a random dry cough that appeared in the last few weeks. I get pains (where I think my heart is) very randomly as well. Not sure what that's about but I have a doctors appointment tomorrow. 

I am more addicted to coffee than ever before! Weird, I had to quit drinking coffee in the beginning.

Edited: added a period and some words to clarify.

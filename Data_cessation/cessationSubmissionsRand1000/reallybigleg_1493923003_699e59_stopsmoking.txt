Depression - how do you think this works?

Before I scare anyone, I had a pre-existing diagnosis of depression and anxiety before I started quitting and I quit for the sake of my (deteriorating) mental health, so this isn't necessarily a sign of what's to come for those in the first couple of weeks of quitting!

I've suffered badly from depression this week. I've managed not to smoke but I had to take a day off work today and I'm severely behind on my projects, I honestly have no idea what I'll do. I can feel emotional anguish most of the day every day. It just feels like a kind of mental torture(?) but I can't link it to anything. I suppose it's like extreme sadness(? Again, unsure how to describe - anguish seems like the best description really), but I really couldn't say: "I'm sad because...." It's just pain. Abject pain. For no...reason....that I can put my finger on.

But I haven't smoked. So that's good! 

I was wondering to myself, because I'm trying to work out how to manage this, whether the pain/depression is a literal, direct withdrawal symptom - i.e. it's "just there", it's pain for no reason - or whether it's more that the coping mechanism has been taken away and this pain is about my actual life. Having quit smoking I've just been forced to face how unhappy I am instead of smoking to soothe? 

I'm leaning towards the second one to be honest, perhaps because it feels more hopeful - it's got this positive spin to it, that the pain is something I can learn from, something I can grow from. I have noticed that when I "crave" it is not actually that I'm thinking I want a cigarette, it's that I'm thinking I want to take the pain away, which suggests to me that I'm trying to soothe and that it's just that's what I used to do to 'numb out' in a way.

I kind of wanted to know others' thoughts and also any words of advice or encouragement on getting through this.

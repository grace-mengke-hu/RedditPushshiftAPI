Trying to justify "one"

Guys. I'm trying to rationalize a smoke today. My addiction is doing A LOT of talking. I ordered a vaporizer last night and it should arrive early next week. I've been sooooo very close to going to buy a pack...."just to get me through until the ecig arrives." You know, I'll "buy a different brand. One I don't like." Or I'll just "smoke a couple a day and continue to use my lozenges for most of my cravings." 


I'm home now. Without cigarettes but my toddler is sleeping in the van and (other than the toddler) I'm by myself and nobody would know but me if I just went to the store and bought some and had one. But then I'd want another and the wanting would carry on into infinity and I don't want to want one forever all the time. I'm sincerely taking this one single second at a time right now. Fack. This is hard.

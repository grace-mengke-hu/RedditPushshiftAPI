I just started smoking 5 months ago socially. Then Is tarted smoking black and milds. Now I have full on cravings. I just bought my first pack of smokes today. How do I stop before this gets worse? I also have a lot addiction I'm trying to quit. Should I quit that first or do both at the same time?

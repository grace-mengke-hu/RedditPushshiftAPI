Just checking in.

Cravings are gone. Dreams of smoking have stopped. The only thing left is that weird curiosity. I've forgotten what a nicotine buzz feels like, and a part of me want's to be reminded. Memories of disgusting mucous every morning and vomiting after a bike ride is all I have left, and all I'll ever need.  

Hang in there, fellow quitters, for the world will become as beautiful as it was when you were a child :)

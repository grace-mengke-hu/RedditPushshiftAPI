Broke down last week, after 4 months....

Bought a pack last week. Been going threw some bad times both at home and at work. Smoked that pack and said I would try again but bought another one right after. It's been 2 days since the 2nds pack was empty and I'm trying again. I dont feel any cravings or wants for a cigarette but I know at work it'll be all to easy for me to buy a pack or bum one. Also my cough is back so if that's not a reason to try again idk what is. I feel disappointed in myself a bit, and I know if I tell my wife she won't understand and would make me feel worse.... so here we go again 2 days under my belt 118 more to go.

Day 153, bronchitis

Hello Everyone!

101 days since I last posted here, whaaat... 

Today, it has been 5 months since I quit smoking! I’m doing very well except I got quite sick with the flu just before the New Year’s. It got so that I started to have trouble breathing. I went to see a doctor and got diagnosed with bronchitis. I’m now on antibiotics and already feeling better but this was an excellent reminder (or warning) of how it feels when you can’t breathe properly. It’s terrifying. I’m so glad I’m not voluntarily pushing myself to that kind of future state of health anymore. 

Happy and smoke-free 2018 to you all ❣️

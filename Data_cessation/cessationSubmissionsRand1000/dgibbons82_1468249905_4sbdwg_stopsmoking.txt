Welllllp.... Here we go again. :(

Did pretty well.  Quit for several months with no issues, and then BOOM!  Drinking and summertime hit me when I wasn't looking...  Now my wife is mad at me for breaking my promise to quit smoking, and I'm feeling like a loser this morning.  Been smoking for about 3 weeks, off and on.  

Going cold turkey today.  Requested a badge reset.  

It's time for me to make my wife proud of me again. :)  My back hurts (which I hope is just from the smoke), my throat is sore, and I wish I never would've gone back to it.  Was it worth it?  Not at all.

Day 62

I walked out of the deli with a bag full of food and an odd feeling that I didn’t get enough things. 

The total had rang up just over $10, which for whatever reason, seemed inappropriate for the setting.

I went to open my car door, caught myself in the window reflection and something about my ‘cool guy’ sunglasses triggered a realization that  

“Oh. I didn’t buy cigarettes.

Oh. Thats because I don’t smoke.

Oh. Neat.”

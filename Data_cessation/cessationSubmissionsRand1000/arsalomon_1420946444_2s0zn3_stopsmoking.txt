60 Days?! What?!

I can't believe I'm sitting on two glorious smoke-free months. This is crazy. There have been some rough patches; I've been using e-cigs on and off, but I haven't lit up in all that time. This subreddit has been extremely helpful and I'm appreciative of the community. This is the best I've felt in a long time. I can breathe more fully, my fingers don't get tingly and numb, I don't reek of cigarettes and feel super self-conscious about it. There's just so much positive. The desire to quit has also made me cut down on drinking since I know alcohol is a huge trigger for me, so it's caused me to make other healthy decisions as well.

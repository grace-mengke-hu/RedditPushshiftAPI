The Day 3 Myth?

It is scientifically proven and just about accepted by all that on a cold turkey quit (no patches or other forms of NRT) that all nicotine has left the body.  But what is the meaning of this?

It seems that half the posters here interpret this wrongly as the  moment you are past the physical addiction and what remains is only psychological part.  I hesitated to post this challenge of that notion because the power of suggestion that the hard part is now behind you could be a helpful one. 

But what about the other newly quit who take that wrong interpretation as fact? And it is very wrong because it  is precisely at this point where WITHDRAWAL gets worse. Are they to believe that they are cursed to be a life long smoker because they are still climbing the walls a week after they should have calmed down? 

New quitters - it does get easier but  give it a little more time then it gets a lot easier. There is nothing wrong with you because you are jonesing past Day 3 because that is when your brain chemistry is the most upset. 

It's misinformation so please ignore it.

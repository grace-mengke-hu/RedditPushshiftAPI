A good reason to quit

So I have proudly made it to 100 days smoke free. it hasn't been easy but I found my reason to quit and it has kept me smoke free every time I really want a cigarette. 

I decided that it wasn't the smoking I wanted to change but my life. I decided I wanted to follow a goal of mine to become a social worker and I need to get my finances in order before I start the course. I was in a managerial role that felt like every day was the same and I had felt stressed and demoralised. I changed position to a sales assistant and I started to feel better. A weight lifted off me. I also changed stores so that there was none of the people I normally smoke with around. I applied to do volunteering with a charity which makes me feel good. Every time I feel like I want to smoke I remember what I want to do with my life and the feeling goes away. I have four years of study ahead and I will have four years of being smoke free too. I will post again at 200

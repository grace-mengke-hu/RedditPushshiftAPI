Thankful

I made it another day, without smoking and I just wanted to write down all the things I am thankful for, since quitting. 

1. I am so thankful for day 7
2. I can smell really well 
3. I taste things so much better and it's amazing
4. I have more time for...a lot of stuff
5. I don't have to worry about when I will get another opportunity to smoke
6. I don't get agitated if I haven't had a chance to smoke yet 
7. I handle stress as I did before - not worse and not better 
8. I went out tonight and I didn't worry about when I'll be able to smoke 
9. I didn't have to worry about it being awkward (asking is it ok if we go outside for a smoke)  with my non smoking friend 
10. I don't have to worry about my budget while buying more cigarettes 
11. I don't have to worry about organising enough smokes for another day or so 

I had cravings today after work and while being out with my friend and having alcohol. I also haven't been sleeping so well the past couple of days. I think about cigarettes a lot. I f-ing hate the struggle!!!

It's  not easy but it's better on some days and I just want people to know, it's important to note down your successes and gains as well. It makes it more real because we are so focused and caught up on our cravings, that this isn't getting the attention it deserves. :)

And thank you for all the support here to and all the inspirational stories! :)

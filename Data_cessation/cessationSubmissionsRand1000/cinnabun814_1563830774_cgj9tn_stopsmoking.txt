How do I stop worrying about my health after being a smoker for one year when I was 20?

I’m 25 and I smoked cigarettes when I was 20 and suicidal for a year and quit when I turned 21.  I keep obsessing over getting lung disease or cancer and I take medication and see both a psychiatrist and psychologist.  Am I being too hard on myself.  The doctors tell me I’m very healthy?

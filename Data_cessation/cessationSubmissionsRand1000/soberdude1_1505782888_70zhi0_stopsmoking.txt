31 Woo Hoo

9/17/17 I'm celebrating 31 years of continuous sobriety. Eternally grateful for the program AA offered me so many years ago. 12 simple steps were life changing. Anything is possible, one day at a time. Never give up, never stop quitting. If you try something and it doesn't work, try something else. Find what works for you.

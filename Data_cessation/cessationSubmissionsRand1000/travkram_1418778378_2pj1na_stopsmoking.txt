At home 3 days project update.

I posted this couple nights ago: http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/2pc4nk/at_home_for_3_days_project/

 and I have failed...at staying at home!! Still cigarette free for almost 2 full days.

I went to the gym and only took my keys and ID.  No cash or credit so I wouldn't be tempted.  

When I got back I decided that I could go get some wings and when I got back to the house with out stopping to buy cigarettes I had a big smile on my face.  

I got Asian Zing and Mango Habanero from Buffalo Wild Wings.  When I first had a bite of the Asian Zing I thought it was the Habanero wings.  When I ate the Habanero wings I felt things on my tongue I haven't felt in 10 years and almost threw up.  

Stay strong my friends.

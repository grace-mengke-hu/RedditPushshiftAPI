How bad should I feel after my slip up? Details below.

I smoked for about a year when I was 20-21 and after four years of not having a cigarette I got super drunk on St Patty’s day and had I think 5 of them.  I hate cigarettes and feel disgusted with myself.  It’d been four years but I’m not tempted in the slightest to ever have another one I just might not drink anymore.  I don’t know what made me have a few the other night.

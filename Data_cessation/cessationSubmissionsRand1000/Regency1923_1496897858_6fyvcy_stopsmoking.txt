I need help badly!

So now I've gone from a raging homicidal person that is in constant anger and I do mean constant anger and frustration.  It was to the point, you tell me to calm down I'm going to ask HOW because I literally couldn't.  Now a depressed, I don't care anymore person.  Unless you are bipolar, you honestly don't know nor feel how awfully strong and quick it can turn.  

I am deep breathing, I am trying to distract myself, I am using halt but none of this is HELPING AT ALL!  I am on medication but heck it feels like I'm not medicated.  I am using the nicotine patch hell I couldn't even go 24 hours without it.

In previous quits: I did read allen carr, it felt too much like a sale pitch and threw the dang thing away.  I read stuff I already knew about and just laughed it off. He didn't say anything I didn't already freaking know.  If I already know it, I'm not going to sit there and watch videos or read a stupid sales pitch book that repeats itself a million times.

Between the bipolar, my life, and now nicotine withdrawal which I am withdrawal from not only high levels of nicotine but also chemicals......I honestly don't know how much more I can handle.  I'm sitting here, just with the most depressed exhausted just completely hopeless look.....even my husband is worried and I keep telling him I'll be fine, I'll be fine, I'll be fineeeeeeeeee but even I'm not sure right now :( 

What the hell do I do?

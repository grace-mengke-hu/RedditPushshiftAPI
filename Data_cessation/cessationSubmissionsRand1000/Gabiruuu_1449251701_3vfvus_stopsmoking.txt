Day 20 and Weekend is coming...

It has been quite ok without smoking during the week.
Already got used at work. That's great! ðŸ˜ƒ
But I always get afraid about weekends. I love to go out with friends, for dinner, drinks and... Oh gosh, I was not the kind of guy who used to go out for smoking, but a night out it was always a sinonimous of a package of cigarettes. 
I still think of them as a fun part of going out...
Any tips to avoid the cigarettes?
I don't want to avoid going out. That would be worst. It would be like admiting that cigarettes are a part of going out, and there's no night life without cigarettes

65 days smoke free update

So I have been a smoker for 10 years, and boy did I love smoking - especially that morning cigarette with my coffee. 

Anyways here is what I have noticed.

1. As an asthmatic I needed to use my inhaler every single night, for the past 65 days I haven't used it once. 
2. I feel like I have a lot more time in my day.
3. My wife doesn't tell me, "ooooh you smell" 

I am still struggling with not smoking, not the craving just the taking out a habit and missing something that I have done and enjoyed for so long.

All in all, I am so happy I stopped and eventually I'll forget that I ever smoked. 
I always think what a stupid and disgusting habit, I'll never be a smoker again.

BE STRONG!!

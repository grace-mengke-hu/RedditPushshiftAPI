Broke Edge After 9 Months. Need Help.

After about 9 months of living smoke free, I ended up breaking edge and have been continuously for 2 months. I haven't bought a pack, but have purchased two e-cigs. I've bummed cigarettes from people, sometimes an upwards of 5-10 in a night overall. I associate cigarettes with drinking in my head, and when one happens, the other follows. I think what broke my edge was working at a bar, which I cannot change - so I need to figure out how to coexist with being around alcohol without smoking. Any ideas? 

Also, I want to not smoke anymore. I'm already feeling strange about it in my head, so I know it's time to put this little vacation to bed. I've been realizing how important being resilient is in terms of a being a self-reliant and confident person, so bouncing back is my head as well. 

Just need some advice. 

Thanks!

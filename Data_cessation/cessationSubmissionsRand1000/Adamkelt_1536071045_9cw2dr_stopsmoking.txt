Restarting from Day One after more than two years free :(

Quit in May 2016 successfully for two years after DECADES of smoking.  Things were fine, and then in June of this year, my life blew the hell up and I broke down.  I had two damn years.  Gone.  I'm gettin' too old for this shit.  


It's been 3 months, and things in my life are settling down finally, and it's time to take my damn life back.  Quitting smoking, eating right, and exercising are the new normal.  No more beating myself up and time to start over.  I did it once, I can do it again.

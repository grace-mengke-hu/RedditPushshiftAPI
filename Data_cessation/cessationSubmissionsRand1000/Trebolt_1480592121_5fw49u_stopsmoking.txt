Just threw my Cigs away.

Just requested a new badge. I didn't smoke for about 5 months and then i picked it up again because my girlfriend broke up and i was drunk as fuck. 

I'm cleaning my room at the moment and i just threw my cigs away. It will be hard but i know i can do it :)

just wanted to get this out of my mind :)

3rd Day closing in

I am 21 years old and I have been smoking a pack a day for almost 5 years. I did quit a couple times from 1 week to a month but it always came back. 

But this time it is a little bit different. About two weeks ago I went to the dentist because I had some minor problems with my teeth (that's what i thought). They were always white and looked healthy on the outside , but on the inside they were the complete opposite. My dentist told me that it's all because I smoked and i had to pay about 600 euros ( which is quite a sum in my country ) to get my teeth fixed. Now i'm almost broke because I had to use all my savings... and this made me think , is it worth it?
Using this product which does only harm , makes you feel like a prisoner every time you try to free yourself from it , does not make you more attractive ( these days it kind of makes you look like a douche ) and so many other negative things... you pay to get ILL , you pay to harm your body. 

That's what I told myself and now here I am , being more confident than ever in myself that i can achieve this , i can make myself a free man , a smoke-free man for the rest of my life and with your help i KNOW i can do it.

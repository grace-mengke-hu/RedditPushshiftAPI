So I relapsed - it was painful, but now...

So I relapsed (on two cigarettes and three puffs) and then quit again real quickly 9 days ago. I was shocked by how addicted I felt after only a couple cigs. I had been quit for going on two years. After just a couple cigarettes, I had full blown physical withdrawal and it was bad. 

BUT the good news is now I think the physical withdrawal has fully passed. It seems like it lasted longer on my other quits. I still have some reminders throughout the day or a few thoughts like, "hey - you have time to buy a pack and sneak one!" But it's easily dismissed by a firm NO in my mind. Last night I even had a dream that I bought a pack, but I was fighting smoking them throughout the whole dream. 

If you relapse, DONT give in and just smoke the whole pack! If you really want to quit again, you can do it! You will prob suffer through withdrawal again, but the worst of it was behind me after a week or so.

Day 1

So today marks day 1, I've taken the weekend off of work.  Today feels rather odd and some what tiring.  I don't know how to explain it, I'm sure having so many medical conditions that I do are also playing on me.  I just feel like sulking pretty much, I don't think I'm depressed just want to sulk.

I'm a sole caregiver to someone with dementia 24 hours a day, along with their power of attorney, along with a full time job, and a wife.  I just celebrated my 32nd birthday in May and it's very high stress.  Even my doctor said she thinks that due to all the stress that I'm having, if all I'm smoking is 5 cigarettes a day then we should keep it at that.  She's honestly scared that with all this stress I'll give myself a heart attack so basically in her mind, anything to help me cope and deal with the stress of all this is worth it as long as it doesn't get too out of hand. I don't drink so that's a positive right?  Although I've been tempted to.

Honestly I guess my main two things with smoking is emotions and stress.  I know I've heard that smoking doesn't help with stress but how do I cope?  How do I cope when I can't leave or I can't remove myself from the situation and the dementia is really bad at that moment?  Unless you've seen moderate dementia and those horrible days, you don't know what I'm talking about.  The emotions of also realizing that this is my family that is slowly loosing her mind is taxing too.  Also keeping myself posed and ready for everything else weither it be work and finances or this or that.

How can I cope with all of this on top of just being a wife and doing all that as well?  How can I cope without cigarettes?  I know I must quit........my triglycerides due to stress and smoking combined isn't helping, 207.  I just want to know how do I cope without having a mental breakdown everyday?

Cannot focus at work

Especially this week, I can't focus at work for more than about 2 minutes at a time. As a programmer, not being able to focus for more than 1-2 minutes makes it nearly impossible to work at all.

WTF do I do about this? I'm 7 days in, and I don't want to reset, but drinking caffeine doesn't help me focus - it gives me incredible anxiety and the cravings get worse since I quit nicotine.

Any recommendations? It's not that I'm distracted by the idea of smoking, I just feel like I've turned ADHD since I let get of nicotine.

Crazy close-call - I'm done

Hello - I just needed to write this down for my own posterity more than anything. Last night some embers from one of my many late-night cigarettes caught onto one of my plants on my 5th floor balcony - thanks to some strong winds it fanned into some small flames. I went to bed without noticing and if it wasn't for someone downstairs who noticed, I could have destroyed my flat/the building and maybe even caused some deaths. How fucking awful! Thankfully the only thing damaged was my plant and the plant box, nothing hurt except my pride. The fire brigade turned up after I doused it, and never been so embarrassed having to explain myself.

Is this really fucking worth it, for a cigarette? Haven’t slept all night, threw my cigs away and I’m done, I’ve had enough. I know it’s going to be hard but sometimes you need something ridiculous like this to push you. 

Wish me luck everyone...

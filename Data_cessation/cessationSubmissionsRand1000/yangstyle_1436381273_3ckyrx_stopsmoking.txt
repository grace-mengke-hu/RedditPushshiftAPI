Didn't even notice it's been two years.[](http://thats-normal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/stephen-colbert-celebration-gif1.gif)

It has been two years since I took my last drag and put that last cigarette out on my back deck. I remember it well. And I will never again draw that vile smoke into my lungs.

Thank you, folks. You helped me more than you will ever know.

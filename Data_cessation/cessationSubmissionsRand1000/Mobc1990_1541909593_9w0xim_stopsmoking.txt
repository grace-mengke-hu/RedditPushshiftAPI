Want to quit smoking,need a bit of advice

Hey guys,i have been smoking for close to 5 month and are now half a pack a day.The main reason i want to quit smoking is because its starting to affect my stamina when playing sports and i couldnt ran as good as when i didnt smoke.Most of my friend whom play the sports do smoke,some of them don't.I need advice because i dont want to be seen as different while they are smoking and i am not.What should i do,i really dont want my stamina to drop somemore as i continue smoking.

My favourite sports is soccer(football in uk),i read that socrates,and johan cruff smoke close to a pack a day...but they are not my favourite player...my favourite player is lionel messi and theirry henry,both of them dont smoke

Some encouragement for you...

Today is my 'Well Done for becoming a non smoker!' day. 

Today is the day where I get to realise how much I wasted on killing myself and how much better off I am for no longer doing that.

In the time I've stopped, I've saved enough to buy my own gaming console for the first time and it is one I've strictly wanted for a while.

I'm getting myself a PlayStation 4!

What the hell was I doing for 10 years??

In your opinion, is it kinda "wrong"/"bad" to give your cigarette to someone rather than throw them away?

I'm on day 4. I'm ready to get rid of my full packet of tobacco, which is valued at around $32 (I'm from Australia). My 2 good friends smoke, they both would definitely love to quit, but aren't attempting to at the moment. Should I give the packet to one of them and save some money, or toss it in the trash? Do you think either is, like, morally wrong? What are your thoughts?

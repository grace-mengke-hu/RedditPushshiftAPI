400+ days as a non smoker - My proudest moment since deciding to quit came last week

Rarely do I feel proud of myself. But last week I did.

Rented a small cottage with a friend in the middle of a forrest next to a lake. All we did all week was barbeque, drink beer, swim in the lake and relax. Good times!

Except, my friend is a smoker. And all those "sweet" summer memories of having no shirt on, a beer in one hand and a cigarette in the other came running back to me.

I sincerely felt the urge to smoke, it was as strong as maybe week 2 of non smoking. Which is crazy, I haven't felt this way in a long time. 

I wanted one so badly but I kept telling myself: *NO drum_playing_twig, one cigarette, even one puff means you're back to square 1. There is no "just one puff". I have smoked "one puff" before. It always means two more, three, one pack, BAM, you're back to square one* This time I decided I have quit for good.

A lot of people share their joy when they've stopped smoking or reached a landmark (1 week, 100 days, 1 year). I just wanted to share my joy because I managed to resist a full week of crappy nostalgic cigarette memories with a friend who constantly smoked in front of me.

**TL;DR: Had 1 week summer vacation with beer, barbeques and a smoking friend. Felt the urge badly to smoke everyday. Managed to resist. Proud as fuck.**

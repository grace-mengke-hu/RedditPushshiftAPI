Out drinking with the guys...

I've been pretty lucky so far, two weeks in and thanks to NRT (vape) I haven't had any particularly bad cravings.  I've had a few *really* mentally unstable days, but haven't wanted a cigarette. Even at the pub, my vape has been plenty good. 

Tonight, though, everyone is smoking, including my other half.  I don't know if it's because I just stepped back from ~10.5mg to 9mg, or if it's just because I'm getting complacent, but I want a damned cigarette.  I'm not giving in, but it's hard on me today =/  just figured I'd post here instead of stewing about the sweet, sweet poison billowing all around me...

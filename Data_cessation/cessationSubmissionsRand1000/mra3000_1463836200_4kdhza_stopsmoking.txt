1 week !

Made it to 1 week! The first 3 days were brutal.. Day 4 a little better, day 5 a little better, day 6 much better .. now day 7. I smoked 10-15 a day for about 5 years. The best part about this morning at 9AM (when I would usually have my first cig of the day) was that I actually forgot about it. 

What worked for me was doing many things all at once: planning for trigger events, lots of water, good food/eating well, chewing gum, long walks to tire myself out so I could sleep, long hot showers, talking to my loved ones about it.

I have to thank you all for being such a great support. This sub continues to be super helpful as a place to learn, to help others, and to beat this nasty habit.

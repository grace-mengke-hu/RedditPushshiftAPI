4 months

Extremely greatful today as I celebrate 4 months totally cigarette and nicotine free. Thanks to Allan Carr and his awesome book, "The Easy Way To Stop Smoking" Helped me go from 30 cigarettes a day for 40 years to non-smoker overnight. I had no cravings, no withdrawal, no anxiety. We have been brainwasher into thinking that it is hard to quit. Its not. I became a non-smoker and it was EASY! I highly recommend this book to anyone struggling with quitting.

6th day and it's getting worse

I read alot about quitting, to me it's just all opposite. 1st few days i had very good motivation and the will power. But as the motivation is fading cravings are hitting so hard. I dunno if i can it take it much longer. How to battle this, there's a fucking war in my head.

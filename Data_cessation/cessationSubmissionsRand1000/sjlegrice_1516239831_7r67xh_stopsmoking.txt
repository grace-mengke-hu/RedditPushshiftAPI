Day 17!!

Ok you guys. I really can't believe I'm saying this but it has been easier the past couple of days. I haven't had hardly any cravings and I feel like if I was to smoke a cigarette right now, it would make me sick. I haven't had a cigarette since New year's Eve and I don't want one. I don't feel like I'm out of the dark yet but if this is how it will feel like soon, it's going to be awesome!  So anyone that may be struggling with those first few days, you can do it. I smoked for 30 years and I have hardly any willpower. If I can do it, you can too!

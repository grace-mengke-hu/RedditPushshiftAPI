Is anyone else having short term memory issues?

I have been a non smoker for 159 days. I used the patches. I followed the directions  and used the 21 mg for 6 weeks then went to the 14 mg and then 7 mg.  So I guess I’ve been nicotine free for about 6 weeks. I have noticed that my short term memory is pretty bad and I just wondered if it’s because I am still in withdrawal from nicotine. Has anyone else experienced this? Or am I just losing It?!?

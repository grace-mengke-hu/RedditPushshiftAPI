Club 31 Halfway Mark?

I haven't seen a post about Club 31 recently. I don't have access to any official list of us either. 

I just wanted to see how everyone was doing! We're halfway there, and that's pretty crazy to me. Those first few days felt like an eternity but here we are :). I'm super glad we started when we did. I don't know if I could have done week 1 with having to see so much family and answer so many questions. 

Quitting nicotine me seems to hate answering questions :P

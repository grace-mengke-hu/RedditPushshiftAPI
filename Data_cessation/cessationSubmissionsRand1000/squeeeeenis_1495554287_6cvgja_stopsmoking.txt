Mothers death stage 4 lung cancer. A very mild, yet deep urge to have a ciggy.[230 days]

Quit cold turkey 230 days ago. 

My Mother was going through stage 4 lung cancer (half a pack a day smoker), and I've since promised to quit vaping/ smoking. 

I'm proud to say that I have stayed 100% true to that promise.

She died in my arms during hospice care. I've seen the **REAL PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL TORTURE THAT IS CANCER.** I would rather smash a spike under each one of my finger nails, then witness a person struggling through that again; let alone a person who means more to me then anyone else on the planet. Personally, I don't think that even the most goreish PSA can even begin to touch the emotionally gut wrenching, train wreck scenario that is lung cancer. 

Needless to say, I've been living in a new depressive/ cold/ loveless world ever since.  I have literally been living my smoking triggers 24 hours a day ever since. 

**Good news?** 

Even while going through this, my urge to smoke tapered off EXPONENTIALLY after the first month. After the third month, my brain completely forgot why I liked smoking so much. 

However, after 230 day, during my peak stress levels; a Tiny, muffled urged to "just smoke one ciggy" keeps popping up. So, I bought a fidget spinner and that seems to help.  

I think I'm just venting... It helps to vent to the internet sometimes...

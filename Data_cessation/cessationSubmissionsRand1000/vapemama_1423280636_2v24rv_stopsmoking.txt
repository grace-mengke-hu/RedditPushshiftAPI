What method did you use to quit?

I tried everything to quit and couldn't do it. I'm sure that sounds dumb but I just couldnt. Finally my husband and I tried one last method and it worked! Not only did we both quit the same day but his dad his 2 brothers and my brother also quit! I feel so amazing! We got vaporizers and have not even wanted a stinky since. It's not 100% healthy but it's so much better than smoking. It is only 4 ingredients versus the 4000 chemicals found in cigarettes and we are all almost down to 0 MG of nicotine. How did you all quit?

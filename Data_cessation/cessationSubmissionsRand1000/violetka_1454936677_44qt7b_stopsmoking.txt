day 5 of my journey home!!!

I am on day 5 of my journey home and being nicotine free. Yesterday a smoking buddy of mine came toinvite me for smoking. I told him I have quit, he shook my hand and offered me his pack, and I said "no no I really quit!". He was absolutely amazed. I am so proud. I am quitting for sure. I can do it! 
today not so much coughing, still some cravings, but nothing terrible. 
May the Force, be with me and help me have another day of abstinance :))

Random bouts of breathlessness?

I'm a little over four months free, but occasionally I'll stand up or be physically active and suddenly be aware of how short of breath I am. It'll harken back to when I first quit, hearing the air wheeze in and out of my throat, but after a few minutes I'll be fine and back to normal.

This happens maybe once a week - anyone else experience this, and how long can I expect this to continue?

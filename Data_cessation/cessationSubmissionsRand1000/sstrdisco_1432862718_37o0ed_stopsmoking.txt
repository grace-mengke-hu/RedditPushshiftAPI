Today was my first hike after having quit smoking...

And I could BREATH!!! I still don't care a whole lot for hiking, but I could breath. And! Get this! I jogged!!! As a child, I loved to run. I was my own personal Forrest Gump. In fact, I'm surprised my family didn't encourage me to keep up with it and go out for track and the like in school. Eh, but anyway...I jogged several times, the furthest being around 30 steps. If you could see me, you'd know how awesome that is. My husband was like, WTF?? My legs are a bit sore this evening, but I'll let tomorrow be a rest day and I'll try another hike the next day!

5 Months today - super duper proud of myself!

It's amazing to reminisce where I've been five months ago and compare it to now. I went through the lowest lows of my life but never caved in. I'm really super proud of myself today. Quitting to smoke kickstarted a whole set of changes in my life that I'm still trying to figure out what they mean. But I'm curious about them and not anxious as before.
Some nonsese rumbling I'm sorry - just needed to express something from inside me. Have a nice day everyone!

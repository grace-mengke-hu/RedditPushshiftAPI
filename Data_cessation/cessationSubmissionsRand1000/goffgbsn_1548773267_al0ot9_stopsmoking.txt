After 25 years of smoking, I finally feel like I'm going to make it. My most successful quit before this was 3 weeks. I feel great and today's milestone is a huge boost to my self-confidence in my quit. Despite the side effects, Chantix has been a godsend. I'll be glad to be done with it, though. ðŸ˜Š

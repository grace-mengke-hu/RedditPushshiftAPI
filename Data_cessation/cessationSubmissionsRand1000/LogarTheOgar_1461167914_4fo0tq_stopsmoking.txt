Made a whoopsie after a big hubbub about 7 days smoke-free

I went on a date with a girl last night. She smokes, but knew I was quit and didn't smoke around me. But I could seem them, I knew she had them. We were walking and talking and about to get coffee at the end of the date and I just didn't know how to talk to someone who smokes without me also smoking.

So I had a cigarette. It actually took convincing her to give me one.

So what I'm saying is how do I get over the nostalgia of smoking a cigarette during a conversation, especially with someone who still smokes.

It's so surreal to see my badge say 4 Days.

I haven't had even one strong craving. 
I've had tiny, almost unnoticeable cravings that I didn't pay any attention to. It's been 4 days and I'm already forgetting about cigarettes. 
Only last week I used to light up a cigarette at least every 30 minutes and now I go all day without any cigarette-related stress. 
I've tried quitting other times, but I failed. I see this time as different because it's not even remotely difficult.

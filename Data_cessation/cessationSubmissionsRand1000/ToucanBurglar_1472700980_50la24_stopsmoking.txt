Now they're making me gag.

One inhale from a cigar (I smoke Primetimes) and I gag. I've puked a couple of times. I guess I've gotta quit now, it's been less than a year and I'm addicted. I smoke despite the gagging, and I chew nicorelief gum if it's really bad that day. 

Anyone have an idea why I'm gagging or puking?

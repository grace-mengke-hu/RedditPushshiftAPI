Giving in

Guys I had couple of cigarettes, actually just one or two puffs both occasions and I did it thinking I can challenge the habit. Now, I realize why everyone says Not one more puff. I am having tough time fighting the cravings...

I know I am not going smoke or continue the challenging knowing how easily smoking could make a way back in my life.

I request each one of you never to do the same experiment to prove yourself!!

4th day without Nicotine, need your opinions

Hey all. I'm on my 4th day now of having cut out nicotine cold turkey and not smoking. Frankly its driving me insane and I'm gonna buy a new vape set up today to at least go through the motions to help me cope.

I want your opinions though - if I've already cut out nicotine for 3 days should I get nic-free e-juice? Or should I get a low dosage like 3 or 6mg.

One side of the argument is that nicotine in e-juice can help with cravings and withdrawal without smoking, but ultimately if I reintroduce nicotine into my body again then I'm going to be continually hooked on nicotine (and lose 3 days of progress in cutting it out).

What are your thoughts? 0mg or 3mg?

I just feel so stupid...

I quit for almost 2 years and started again and have been smoking on and off for a year. Now I can't quit for more than 2 months. I was going great, working towards three months and then my best friend came for a visit. He smokes cigars and I figured a cigar is not a Cig. So I started smoking those with him. Then I went to work one day and didn't bring any Cigars with me. So a Co-worker was smoking a cig and I stupidly decided to smoke one. Now I'm back to a pack a day again. I feel so shitty about myself. My breathing is shit. I tell myself everyday that it's the last day I'm smoking. That tomorrow I will put a patch on. Then I wake up and grab a cig. I just feel like a failure. Sorry for the whining....

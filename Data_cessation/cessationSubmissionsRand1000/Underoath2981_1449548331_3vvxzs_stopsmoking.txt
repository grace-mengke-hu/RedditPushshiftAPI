That's it, I'm done. Day 1

I started vaping around a year and a half ago, socially smoked here and there, smoked cigars occasionally, hookah on occasion, tried dip once and spliffs back when I was smoking marijuana. Then I tried quiting vaping around a month ago, and ended up buying a pack of cigarettes. 

It all started when my ex girlfriend got a vape pen to quit smoking. We broke up and I ended up with it because she picked smoking back up. I started on 12 mg of nicotine then. I hit it heavy and would vape until I was nicotine sick. I used 12 mg for a steady 6-8 months then quit cold turkey. I got some cravings around 2 months after quitting so I started on 0mg. Shortly after that I was up to 6mg, and stayed there until late October. The University went smoke free in November, and I planned to quit when that happened so I moved down to 3mg. Then I bought a pack of smokes, American spirits mentol were my choice. I had given away my drip tip and didn't have anything to vape with when I got some cravings. I just finished my last cigarette, and I'm done for good this time. 

I don't think I can ever go back to vaping, hookah, cigars, any of it. Nicotine was a burden on my back that I need gone. 

If anyone says you can't get addicted to vaping they are a liar. On every different strength that I tried I just vaped until I got a nicotine high, or at least enough to fend off a headache. 

Sorry if this is a little rambling, but this time it's going to stick. I'm moving back in with my mom soon instead of living on campus for school and I can't smoke at her place, so this is the end. Nicotine is beautiful, but it's a goblin that latches onto you, and before you know it you need it. I just finished my last cigarette, and am waiting for a movie to start. This is the end of an addiction that I've had for the better part of my college career. I'm only 21, and don't need this on me for the rest of my long life.

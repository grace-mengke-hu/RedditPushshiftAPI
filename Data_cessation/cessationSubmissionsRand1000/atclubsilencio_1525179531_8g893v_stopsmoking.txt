7 hrs 25 mins smoke free.

Third time trying. This time I got 21mg patches from my doctor which were covered from insurance. Still want to go outside and have my morning smoke, driving me nuts. But I need money and would rather not waste it on toxic, cancerous, smoke sticks.

Ughhh.... want one bad though. I can do this.

Day 1 of quitting Cold Turkey. Frustration ensues

Hey everyone. 21 years old here, 22 in February and I've been smoking for about 3 years now, I really really want to quit. I went to my local smoke shop this morning and they were out of my kind of cigs so I decided I'm quitting today, cold turkey, no games. 

Fast Forward 7 hours and I'm struggling to get through my work day without one. How do you remind yourself that quitting is a good thing, when the only thing on your mind is a fresh bogie??? How do I get through the first week? Thanks everyone.

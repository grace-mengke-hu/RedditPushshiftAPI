I'm done.

Kinda reluctant to make this post, but I want to hold myself accountable and see it later.

Offically at 3:55PM today I am done with smoking. I've typed a whole backstory and deleted it, I guess I just want to see the decision I made which is important to me without delving into all the details.

Good luck to everyone quitting or who wants to quit! And I'm glad you guys post apps, I downloaded one to help. :)

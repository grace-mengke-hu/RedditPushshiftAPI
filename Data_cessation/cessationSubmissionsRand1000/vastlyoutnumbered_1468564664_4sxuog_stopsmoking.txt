Two years, where has the time gone?

About two years ago, I made an account and posted this:

Today, I'm happy to report my two year quitiversary. For all you new guys taking the plunge now, it's sooooo worth it. I've saved Â£4151 (probably more since the cost of my brand has risen significantly). I can taste and smell and climb a set of stairs without having a coughing fit. And, best of all, I never think about cigarettes at all. If you're quitting today or this week just remember to drink lots of water and not smoke. Thanks to this sub for the guidance, it really helped a lot. Roll on the three year quitiversary.

Alcohol and coffee

For some reason i feel like beer helps with my symptoms.  I feel like it helps flush the cleansing organs and absorbs some toxins and helps clean them out.  Not sure.  Just a beer or 2 not getting drunk.  Not at a bar or where people smoke.

Also i feel like strong coffee helps too.  Maybe its just cause i love the smell and taste so much now. 

Also anything with strong flavor or spicy flavor i feel helps.  I eat raw garlic and honey and it feels like my blood can feel it.  I can taste it in my boood for hours.  Cayanne pepper thai chilis jalapenos all these i feel like help burn the nicotine and toxins out.  

Let me know if anyone feels the same.

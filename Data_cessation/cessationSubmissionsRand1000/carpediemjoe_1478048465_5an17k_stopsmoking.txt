I quit with zero cravings

I have tried everything. Chantix. Gum. Patches. Tongue spray. Vaping. Cold turkey a la Carr. And with each one I felt like garbage and fell off the wagon. 

I went to the doctor last week and she said she was a two pack a day smoker and quit cold turkey with no withdrawals after she did hypnosis for smoking cessation. 

I looked into it and a one hour session by me is $250. Uh no thanks. But thankfully Al Gore invented the Internet and I found an hour long smoking hypnosis audio recording on YouTube. You can find it here: https://youtu.be/Iy6A1IOkIsM

I listened to that 48 hours ago and haven't smoked since. Haven't really even thought of cigarettes. And when I think of them there is no urge. Totally crazy. 

I was a non believer in hypnosis to be clear. But I gotta say it does something because nothing else has given me this peace and calm. 

So the way to use the recording is to do it before bed. Make sure nothing with distract you. Put on headphones while laying down with your eyes closed. That's it. And just be open to it and follow the instructions the guy says. I have listened to it three times already. Twice at night and once in the morning to make sure it all really sunk in. 

Anyway this could do absolutely nothing for you. Or it could help one person on here break free from slavery to nicotine. 

Eat the meat. Spit out the bone. 

Nota bene: I have read Carr cover to cover multiple times and even with the knowledge he gives you I wasn't able to do it cold turkey until now.

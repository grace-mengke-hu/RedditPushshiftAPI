Two Years Today!

Please have faith in yourselves. Like everything worthwhile, it's difficult in the beginning and even some bumpy patches later but don't second guess or give up because it's so great on the other side. Honestly, not smoking is easier than all the bs you have to go through to keep smoking so don't give up.

If I can do it, you can. I swear.

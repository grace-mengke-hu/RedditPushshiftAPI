8 weeks free! Smoked for many years, but after spending most of this year reducing and trying time and again, I am finally 8 weeks clean from smokes.

I did smoke for almost 20 years and tried to quit many times. lots of times I quit for a few days to a couple weeks, but this is the first time I've stayed quit this long.  

I feel good.  Smoking is not really on my mind except maybe once every couple days.  I do still drink, and if I got wasted with smokers, there might be some small chance that I would be very tempted, but I avoid that situation.  I do not want to go back to the ick of cigarettes.  I can't even believe how much better I feel.

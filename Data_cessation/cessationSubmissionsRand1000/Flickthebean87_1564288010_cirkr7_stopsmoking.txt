Best products to use to clean the house after heavy smoking for years? Sprays as well.

I want to wipe down all the walls to remove the nicotine and all the nasty stuff. We may eventually try to repaint, but canâ€™t right now. Although the smell no longer lingers in the house, I also want to carpet clean the furniture. Anyone done this? And what have you used?

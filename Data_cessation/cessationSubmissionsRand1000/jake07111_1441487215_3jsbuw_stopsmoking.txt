ONE MONTH! YOU CAN DO IT TOO!

Just reading posts of so many people slipping up, makes me feel bad for them because i have been there before also. remember THE CRAVINGS ARE TEMPORARY. they are awful, and stressful, but they are NORMAL to have after quitting. You can be free too, I am not at the end of my journey either but I plan to never smoke again. Good luck fellow quitters!

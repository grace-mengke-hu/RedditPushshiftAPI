20 hours in!

My last quit was 7 days. But work related stress made me bum one.
Feels terrible each time I fall off the wagon.

I tried many times to quit and each attempt to quit seem more impossible and more daunting so I really need this one to stick. 

I was so tempted this morning but I counted backwards from 100...it helped!

Aww. Thanks for the party. One Year!

Thanks for the party.   What a nice gesture.  And humor. And romance too.  I'm blushing.  After work I'll see if there is any bubbly left.

Like the other guys say, it would be easy to forget to post the one year.  That is why it is an important milestone.  

There is someone out there lurking, too scared to come in ^^hi!  ^^wave-wave.  They can see the brave souls just starting out all the way through the multi-year posts.  You can quit.  People are doing it here every day.  It's messy work sometimes.

Some of you might have seen [Odyssey is go for EDL comm support] (http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/30bjxh/odyssey_is_go_for_edl_comm_support/).

It is from a video I watched last night.  It is the NASA video of the curiosity landing on Mars.  I have two versions.  A four minute version and a twenty minute version.  I watched the twenty minute version as an antidote to all the plane crash video I saw at work.  The four minute version should last *longer than a craving*.   Links below.

At 2:30 in the longer video. You will hear "Odyssey is go for EDL comm Support." responded to with "Great to hear from you; thank you very much  *<applause>*"  EDL is Nasa speak for "Entry, Descent, and Landing."   Odyssey was launched in 2001 to orbit Mars.  It's planned end date was 2004.  It is still in service.  So that cranky old satellite that won't go away was ready to ~~watch~~ help the new guy land.

That is the sense of exhilaration I feel.  Thanks for being a part of my life.

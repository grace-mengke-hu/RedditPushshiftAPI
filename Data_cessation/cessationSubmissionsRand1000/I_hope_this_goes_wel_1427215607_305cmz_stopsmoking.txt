Still haven't seen my star. Oh look how pretty it is!

This is awesome. I have never gone this long and it just feels so great to know that I have officially quit. I made the decision. I'm sticking to it. I quit!



The coolest part about it is that my friend and his girlfriend saw my success and are now going to quit at the beginning of April. It feels good to know that I am a positive influence on other people. I really can't describe the joy that gives me.


I am also on track to success. One of my biggest personal goals is to become a millionaire by the time I turn 30 (I'm 22 now). I have been involved with a huge group of successful people for the last 3, almost 4 years. The only problem was that I was a secret smoker with them. None of them knew I smoked and I planned to keep it that way because I thought they wouldn't take me seriously if they knew I smoked cigarettes. Since I have quit I no longer count down the minutes until our meetings are over; I now wish they were longer. I don't leave as soon as the meeting releases; I stay late. If someone reaches out to me and wants to meet up I now look forward to it rather than making up some lame excuse to cancel just because I didn't want to go more than an hour without a cigarette. I was foolish is this stupid addiction held me back from so many personal and financial goals for so long. It's just good to know and **feel** that I am back on track with my life and I owe it all to quitting smoking.

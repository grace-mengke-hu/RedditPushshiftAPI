I see you there you sexy little 6 month badge...

Technically I am 1.5 days away from 6 months, and I plan to celebrate Friday.  Not sure how yet, I feel like this is a 'Treat yo self' moment. Perhaps I'll have a nice whiskey, or grill a nice steak, maybe ask the wife for a little 'somethin special'

Sitting back and seeing the kids play and know I get more time with them is one hell of a reward, but pamper me dammit.

At this point I really don't think about it much. Time just flies, 6 months snuck up on me when I wasn't looking or something and I couldn't be happier about it.

I just had my last hit of nicotine.

I resolved to quit yesterday, and smoked all day today. A whole pack, which ended tonight with my final cigarette. 

I was mad at myself and kept true to my promise to buy some running shoes on my way home from work. I went for a pathetically short jog tonight. I was so winded from going around the block I spent 20 minutes recovering in my recliner.

I then started and finished reading the Easy Way and I'm so fucking excited to LIVE the rest of my life as a happy non-smoker. I'm free now. I'm not a slave to cigarettes, and I have a long and healthy life to look forward to. I can't wait to start my day tomorrow with a jog instead of disgusting poison.

Constantly fighting my addiction

Hi guys, it's my 4th day and it's my second serious attempt at quitting (first one lasted 6 days). I'm still a student and I am fighting my brain during the lessons all day. I can't concentrate on anything.

One moment I be like: fuck it, I'll get a pack on my way home, and the next one like: wtf am I thinking about. I'm like this the whole day. My heart starts beating faster when I fantasize about smoking a cigarette. I get really excited. Then I start thinking about why I quit, it makes it a little bit better.

It's really frustrating, is it going to get any better anytime soon?

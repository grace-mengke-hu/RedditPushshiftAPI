I fucked up multiple times...

So... I fucked this whole thing up multiple times after just 2 or 3 days, knowing that I hate smoking and just everything about it.

From now on I'm back on the train again. I just can't stand that taste in my mouth when I wake up - it's just horrible, god save Listerine. :-D

Keep your thing up and... please... don't fuck it up like I did.

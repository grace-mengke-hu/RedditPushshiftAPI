Restless Legs After Quitting

I’m on my 12th day of being quit and I’ve noticed the last few days my legs have been constantly restless . (Tingly , twitching , shaky, constant urge to move my legs ) . I’ve read online that this can sometimes happen after people quit smoking. Like they always have restless leg syndrome but smoking masks it somehow (probably from having poor circulation idk) so when you quit it’s more noticeable . 

I’m wondering if anyone in this sub has experienced anything similar ? I have been quit for almost 13 days now and I haven’t felt any benefits of quitting , only more suffering lol it’s really un-motivating and this feeling in my legs drives me nuts . Some people online have said the only way they got rid of it was starting smoking again which I don’t want to do , and I won’t , but I can’t handle this much longer , such an annoying feeling !

Seriously struggling right now :/

Damn smokers! I was at a party in a small room full of smokers and it smelled like shit! The nicotine in the air hit me and I got my first craving since I quit. It was really hard and still hasn't gone completely. If it wasn't my boyfriend who said "Please don't!", I probably would have relapsed by now.
I am so happy they banned smoking in public places! I never had a craving and felt just perfect until I got to that room!!!
P.S. I had breathed so much nicotine that I feel as if I smoked 3 cigarettes and now I only want more :/

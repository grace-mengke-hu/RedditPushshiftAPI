Congratulations to all of you.

I've been smoking heavily for 5 and a half years now. I show no signs of being able to quit. I've tried quitting hundreds of times, i work security in a night club... My position is the smoking area, i have depression and anxiety which makes it even harder to quit. 


The reason i'm posting this is because i've been a lurker on this subreddit for about 6 months and seeing all the people going smoke free does give me some hope.

So if you could say some things to lurkers on here what would it be? 
Something strange you noticed when you gave up that made it easier? 
Dental hygiene or general health? 
Money reasons? 
Family reasons? 

This subreddit genuinely seems to be about helping and supporting each other but its taken me 6 months to say anything and i'm wondering how many others are like me who just need that extra push or knowledge from someone going through the same things.

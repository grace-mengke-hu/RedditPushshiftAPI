5 days now

I posted I was gonna try and, against my own expectations, I'm passing the test at the moment: today is my fifth day in a row without smoking and I think I am doing relatively fine after 9 years of 20+ avg cigs a day. Just one thing: is it normal to feel sad, or kinda depressive, when you don't fill with a cigarrete the time you once did? I mean, I link all my daily actions to smoking and now there's no smoke and it feels...empty. Sorry for my english, hope it is understandable enough.

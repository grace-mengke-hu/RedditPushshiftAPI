Gut issues and smelly farts?

Hi guys. I'm into my 2nd smoke free week for the first time in twenty years :) Feels great!

I'm having some small issues with farting quite a lot (smelly, but nobody minds their own brand, right?) and my gut is being a bit weird. No direrah or any thing. My poop is actually a bit more firm than before. I always poop in the morning before I go to work, but my smoke quit has turned this a bit upside down, and not I need "my poop" in the middle of the day which is a bit of a problem since there is no toilet where I'm working. Maybe I just need time to adjust.

Has anyone else had the smelly fart issue?

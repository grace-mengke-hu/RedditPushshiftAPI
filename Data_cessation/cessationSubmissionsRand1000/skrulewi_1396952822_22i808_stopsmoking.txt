One week. End of Daily Check-In Posts. Thank you /Stopsmoking

It's 3:22 AM. I guess the insomnia hasn't quite left me. Coffee is much stronger than usual these days.

My close friend who is also a night owl took me out to a late dinner and then a long drive and walk with his dog all over town until 2 AM. I got to absolutely vent every weird and crazy feeling and anxiety that this has brought up this week. It was wonderful. I'm so grateful for friends like that.

Here's to week two. Someone told me today that for them, weeks 2 through 4 were the hardest. The withdrawal symptoms for me were not a problem in terms of relapse. They made my life crazy this week, but I wasn't really ever fantasizing about smoking to make them better. I know it's the next few weeks that are dangerous, when the insidious thoughts of 'Well, maybe you don't really need to quit right now,' or, 'Just one cigarette for doing so well,' or, 'fuck it, fuck it, FUCK IT. Fuck you, you piece of shit, just smoke, everything is bullshit anyway,' start to creep in.

That last one is the thought I've relapsed on the last two times. 'Fuck it you piece of shit, nothing matters, go smoke.' That's what I'm afraid of, and that's what I need to be vigilant for.

Thanks for all your help. I know some of you found these posts annoying, but it helped me stay clean from smoking to know I'd get a few cursory replies to my daily post.

Take care everyone.

Even after 500+ days the addiction has weird ways of showing itself.

I haven't had a cigarette in over a year and I will never go back. I love being a former smoker and I am so happy I quit. It was the best thing I have ever done for myself.

However, every once in a while my addiction just randomly shows its ugly head. Earlier today I was picking up a can of diet coke for a long drive and without any prompting the first thought that popped into my head was "Perf, I'll use this for the butts." It was totally unintentional and subconscious and made me so confused. I just wonder if this happens to anyone else? And if it does just know you are not alone.

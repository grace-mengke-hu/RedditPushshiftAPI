Relapsed after 15 Days. Sigh.

So I smoked on Saturday and Sunday, 4 each day, after 15 days. Probably to do with Easter, family, sadness about the past and my current situation. Of course a cigarette didn't change any of that. 

I am resetting my badge. I now realize I had a lot more energy and motivation when I quit.

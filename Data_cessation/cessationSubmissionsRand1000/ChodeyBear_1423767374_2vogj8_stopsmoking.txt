Ughhhhh, life sucks sometimes

I've had a particularly shitty time at work for the last 3 weeks, with people being arseholes to me. It's part and parcel of my job, but it's been particularly bad. A number of times it's crossed my mind that a smoke would be helpful. I think I need to watch the video again. 

Still, I'm smarter than that, and I know I won't actually do it. I've just bleached my teeth as a gift to myself. :)

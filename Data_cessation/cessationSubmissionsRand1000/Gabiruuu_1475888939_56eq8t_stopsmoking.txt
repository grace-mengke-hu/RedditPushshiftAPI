From day 3 to day 327

Why day 327? Because it is another day without smoking and that is as good as day 3! 

Funny how I still get the urge to come here, usually with the urge to help people the way I felt helped in my early days. Not so longer to get help.

Many times I read posts from people who are on the 2nd or 3rd day, and I fell like, dude, there will be so much more to deal with. And that is true. But fast I realize I cannot think like that. The thing is, nowadays it is easy for me to look back to those days and think that way. But honestly, what you're achieving with day 3 is HUGE!

I remember when I decided to quit, I posted on facebook on the 3rd day that I've quit smoking. No one believed that it would last. I felt angry because I really made a huge effort to achieve that 3rd day! It was not easy at all! Nowadays friends take me as an exemple because I was able to keep it going. 

As far as it might look to you that a 3rd day not smoking is nothing, and that you will give up and try again other time, 3 days not smoking is what it took to everyone that are Ex-smokers today. The big difference is that they didn't give up on trying on the 3rd day and kept it going.
Don't make your achievements smaller than they are. If you are on day 1, 3, 5 or 10, that's huge! That is the beginning that everyone has to go through. Be proud of it. The secret is to keep it going no matter what, day after day. You'll see it will worth! ðŸ˜‰

Studio Itch

I haven't smoked in 12 days...I also haven't painted in 12 days. I am an artists and when I paint in my studio I smoke in my studio...this is going to be hard...so far I have been painting for two hours without a smoke. when I make a good mark on the canvas I am habitually reaching into my pocket for a congratulatory smoke...I considered doing push ups instead one time, but then laughed out how ridiculous this all is. This is the last thing I have to push through, and I will make it happen. 

Thanks for listening.

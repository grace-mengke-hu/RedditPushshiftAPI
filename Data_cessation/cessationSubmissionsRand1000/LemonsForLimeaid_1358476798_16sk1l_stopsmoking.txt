I don't even think of cigarettes

So I quit cold turkey and my new life style is eating extremely healthy and going to the gym regularly. I use fitocracy.com and myfitnesspal.com. Now, I picture all the nutrients and nourishment I put in my body going through the veins into my muscle tissue and cells rather than nasty smoke annihilating my lung tissue. I am down in body fat percentage and increased muscle mass in this month of none smoking. I would say it has been a success. 

* **Obligatory stats**
* 32 days since last cigarette
* $210.45 saved
* 481 cigs not smoked
* 2 days time saved (those this mean I didn't lose 2 days of my life or I saved 2 days worth of time from smoking?)

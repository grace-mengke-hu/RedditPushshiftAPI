Midnight tonight is it. im done

ive quit so many times, only to pick it back up again. i think i know what my biggest trigger is, fast food. ive always been a skinny guy, been smoking on/off for 3 years, and i still work out regularly. however i know i wont be the same person i am in 5 and 10 years down the road. so im done. i started cooking more, and i even "eat out" healthy (i have a freshly subscription). i'll eat out every now and then, but i have alternatives now to curb that.

Life at 2.5 years without a smoke

First, I donâ€™t miss smoking. Honestly, it never crosses my mind anymore. Which early in my recovery I never thought would happen. Second, the momentum from quitting smoking allowed me to tackle another demon, my addiction to alcohol. And as of today I am 191 days without a drink.

Today our basement flooded with 8 inches of water and the thought to have a drink or smoke never crossed my mind. That was a huge milestone.

Cheering you guys on. There is a light at the end of the tunnel I promise.

Question on Allen Carr's book

Hi!  I've been lurking for about a month now. Recently found out I was pregnant and quit cold turkey. After the doctor told me to just cut back and not cold turkey it I decided to try it that way. Didn't work. I smoked just as much. :( So here I am 5 weeks pregnant and I don't want to continue to smoke. 

I bought Allen Carr's book. And I never read it. I read bits and pieces but the beginning he seems to be just saying the same things over and over. I guess that's just him trying to get that in your head. 

Anyway - I decided I needed to quit cold turkey again (because I was doing just fine until I was told it was okay to do it) and I feel great!  However I really want to read this book and relieve the withdrawal symptoms and I don't want to have cravings until I die like I hear happens.

Not long into the book did I read that he says he wants you to continue to smoke. I'm not going to pick up the pack of smokes I have just to erase the 3 days I've slaved away for.  

My question is - will reading the book help even if I have quit for a few days?

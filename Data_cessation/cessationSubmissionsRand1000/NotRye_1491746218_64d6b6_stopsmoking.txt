Thanks to Allen Carr, I'm nearing 2 years smoke-free

I am 11 days away from my 2 year anniversary (4/20/15) and I would like to share a few things about my journey.  Some positive, some not so much.  

As far as positive goes, I still don't crave cigarettes.  The audiobook did a great job in ridding me of that.  Part of what keeps me from having an experimental smoke is the knowledge that should I reintroduce nicotine to my body, the cravings will begin anew.  

Obviously, I also refrain from having "just one smoke" because I remember that it will lead to slavery and death.  There is no "just one smoke" anyway.  

Something unusual is that I still enjoy the smell of smoke.  Like two days ago while walking home from college, I caught a whiff in the air and combined with the warm spring weather, it brought on a feeling of nostalgia.  It was nice.  But you know what?  That feeling was completely independent of a craving.  I took in the smell, but I continued on my merry way without actually wanting  a cigarette.  

And now on to the negative.  Not one person I recommended Allen Carr to have bothered to give him a listen.  Not one.  And there they are, occasionally deciding to go on the Nicoderm patch and hoping for the best.  Sure enough, all of them went back to smoking afterward.  I feel bad, like I could try harder to convince them, but at the same time it isn't my business.  

And that's that.  Not much negativity associated with quitting smoking.  It's been about 2 years and life is pretty damn fantastic!  

Great job, all of you quitters out there.  Thanks for reading my post!

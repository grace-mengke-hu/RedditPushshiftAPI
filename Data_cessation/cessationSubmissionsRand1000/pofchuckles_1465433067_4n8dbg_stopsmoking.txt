About to go and play football/soccer

I'm basically now at 3 days. I've smoked for 9 years but not played football for 5. I'm really excited and I think 3 days difference will make a huge difference to of if I was still smoking. I'm just scared I'll have a heart attack..I'm 26 this isn't a normal thought rite? I just did a winter snowboarding I should be ok? I just want to enjoy. Quitting smoking will help the guilt and enable me to enjoy more things

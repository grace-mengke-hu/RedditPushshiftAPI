Driving is a huge issue for me, found a good way to not smoke!

Hi all, 
I'm only three days in but driving has always been a huge problem in my previous quit attempts. I've been using the SmokeFree app for Iphone and today's mission was to make a playlist to listen to when you want to smoke. This was perfect for me to listen to in the car since i had scheduled myself for three hours in the car today. Usually this means at least ten cigs. Today I didn't smoke a single one!!! I found that singing at the top of my lungs made me not want to smoke. Maybe it was the deep breaths I was taking to sing, or the happiness that I felt, but all I can say is I didn't even consider pulling off the highway to the gas stations that I have memorized along the route to buy a pack. I'm feeling very accomplished. thanks for listening r/stopsmoking!

Hypnosis for Quitting?

Met with my doctor recently and she said she was a two pack a day smoker but quit cold turkey with no withdrawals after she did hypnosis for smoking cessation. Allen Carr quit with hypnosis as well (although he says it wasn't actually the hypnosis that helped him). Does anyone on here have positive or negative experiences with quitting with hypnosis? I'm scheduled to get it done this Thursday. My badge is wrong. Still smoking right now.

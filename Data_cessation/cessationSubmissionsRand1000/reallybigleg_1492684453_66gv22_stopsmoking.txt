Day 6, or 2, depending on how you count it :)

Hello
I'm on Day 6 if you count the days where I cracked and had one or two, or Day Two if you're looking at it as having had no nicotine at all. I've suffered withdrawal for six days, though, having been a heavy smoker previously, so I prefer to look at it as Six Days, and I prefer to ignore the "slips", as if I look at it as "if I have a puff I'm back to square one" then I don't quit (been there before).

Anyway, going good! I'm nauseous **all the time** so I've had some trouble eating, my concentration still isn't great but it's better, **but** most of my other withdrawals are on their way out. The cravings are nowhere near as bad, the tension is almost gone completely compared with the first couple of days. 

I've said on my previous thread that my incentive to quit was that I suffer from a severe anxiety disorder - panic disorder w/agoraphobia. I have tried very hard to overcome that disorder but sucking panic-inducing stimulants into my lungs 20 times a day was definitely holding me back.

So far, despite the anxiety and agitation you have from the quitting process, none of the symptoms even come close to how bad the panic disorder was and the panic symptoms themselves are better than they were because I have cut out the nicotine (and most caffeine) and probably also due to the psychological effect of making a big change for myself. I have a bit of depression/feelings of despair, but it's difficult to say that's definitely the quitting and not just the underlying disorder.

Overall, it definitely feels like this is the best decision I ever made! In a way I think I'm lucky to have such a major incentive to quit. Unlike other quitters, I feel the benefits immediately through the vast reduction in anxiety so it's really obvious to me that I'm choosing to feel "a bit ill at the moment" over choosing to go back to the nightmare I've come from.

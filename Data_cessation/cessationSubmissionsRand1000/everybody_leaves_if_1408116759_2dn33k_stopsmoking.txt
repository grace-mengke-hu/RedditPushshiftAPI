7 x 7

today is a special day, 7 being my lucky number. so here i am at 7 times 7 days of not smoking! couldn't have done it without you.

been not posting here so much lately - and a lot more grouchily when i do, i've noticed - due to a lot of life stress. relationship over, physical rehabilitation painful, workload increased exponentially at exactly the wrong moment - but what's amazing is that my mind hardly ever goes to smoking. even if i consciously entertain the thought it just seems stupid and unfulfilling, not like something i'd even want to do.

really cracking down on the Just One lie has got me there i think, moreso than anything else. it is conceivable to entertain the notion of having and enjoying only one cigarette (although in reality i highly doubt that would be pleasurable to me), but the mere thought of going back to the misery of fulltime smoking makes my blood run cold for a second. i shiver and don't even feel particularly grateful to have escaped addiction. my disregard for smoking has reached the point where i *would* be resentful at myself for ever doing it, *if* regrets were my bag baby which they aren't.

i love all you fabulous quitters, keep at it, stay strong, remember the battle is in your mind. any fool can work and strain to deprive themselves of something, but then will only last as long as their inevitably finite willpower - that's why i struggled to quit in the past (10 year smoker, many long quitting stretches). 

what's needed is to reposition yourself as one armed with the facts and unafraid to look unflinchingly at your own behaviour before cutting and burning those parts deemed undesirable. you can do it, anybody can who sets their mind to it. so you owe it to yourself to do it.

peace y'all

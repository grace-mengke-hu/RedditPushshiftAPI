Just checking in :)

Hey all. I've been here a few times on previous quits, however, they fell through. These past two months or so I've been taking quitting a lot more seriously. I did quits of 20 and 16 days (and my current one) with a couple days of smoking in-between as I couldn't handle the depression. 

Anyway, I decided to try something different this time. All my previous attempts have involved either cold turkey or vaping on 0mg liquid. So, I decided to buy some 4mg gum and honestly I haven't looked back. Been using it since day one and it's been incredible for helping with cravings and my general mood and mindset. I feel incredible and for the first time feel genuinely free from my addiction.

Obviously, I've still got a long way to go. I'll have to drop down the dosage on my gum but, well, baby steps. :)

I don't really know what the purpose of this post is but I guess if there's anyone out there really struggling with quitting and has failed multiple times in the past, don't be afraid to try something different. Cold turkey isn't a method for everyone, and don't see using NRT as being defeated or weak-willed. I have a ton of respect for all of you. 

TL;DR: nicotine gum rocks

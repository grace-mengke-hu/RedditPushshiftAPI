3 months quit with Champix Friday failure

Long time smoker about 25 years. Was proud of myself but failed ended up getting wasted with my friends have been bored all summer so smoked a few  and continued all weekend. Hate feeling this way. Hate the fact that I equate “smoking” with “fun”. Never really had any hobbies felt lost most of the time. Does anyone else struggle with this? Did anyone binge smoke for a weekend and then successfully quit after the weekend ended? I need hope. I need someone to believe in me. Am I too late? Did I really mess up? Three months quit. I’m so angry with myself! I need encouragement hoping someone can help.

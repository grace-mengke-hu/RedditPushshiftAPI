Question for smoking veterans

I'm going on a trip where I'll visit multiple countries and travel a lot while also partying and drinking occasionally. Is it considered cheating if I buy 1-2 disposable electronic cigarettes (without nicotine), and puff on these when I feel super-strong cravings? 

I mean, I'd still be nicotine, tobacco and tar-free, so what's the damage here? Am I just being hypocritical?

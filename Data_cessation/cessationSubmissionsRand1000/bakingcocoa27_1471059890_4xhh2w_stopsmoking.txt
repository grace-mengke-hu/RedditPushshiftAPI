300 Hours and going strong

I can still remember the timer ticking it's way to 12 hours, then 24, then 30 and 35.  The clock is about to strike 300 hours and I feel very positive.  I've half-assed about a dozen quits over the last 10 years - the difference this time is only drive and ambition, and what a difference it makes.  I leave tomorrow for a two year graduate program on full scholarship, and I just felt I couldn't let someone else make such a significant investment in me without pitching in myself to maximize the value of this fortunate experience.  Each day is a challenge, but I feel like I get a little stronger each day.  I've encountered nearly all of my major triggers in the last 300 hours - namely family and work stress, long distance driving, over eating, and drinking.  I haven't spent time with other smokers yet, but I have the fortune of picking my new friends carefully as I move to a new city.  

If you're in the first 10 days, stay strong and remember your motivators.  Reach out whenever you need to.  Chew another tooth pick.  Eat another piece of Trident.  Drink another bottle of water.  Take another bubble bath (this helps a lot at night for me lol.)  The mental and physical pain of withdrawal turns into pleasure soon.  If you want it, I know you can do it.

Take care of yourselves.

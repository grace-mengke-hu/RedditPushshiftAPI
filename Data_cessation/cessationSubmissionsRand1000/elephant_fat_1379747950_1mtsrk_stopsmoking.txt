After three tough days, I just had a little victory

Three days ago, I nearly walked to the corner store to buy a pack. The next day, I saw a used butt on the ground and had another bad craving. Yesterday, I had an uncomfortable conversation with someone, was embarrassed. In the past, this always led me light up, but I pulled through.

All this had me wondering whether I was no longer making progress. Then, tonight, I saw someone smoking across the street. For the first time, rather than trigger a craving, seeing someone smoke made me think "wow, I'm glad I don't have to do that anymore."

And it felt awesome. Thanks for reading :).

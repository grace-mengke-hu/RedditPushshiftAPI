Dropped something under my front seat and found a half pack and I did not smoke. Even though I really, really, really wanted to.

But I did litter because quite frankly they just had to go before I justified lighting one. Might sound weak, but I did toss them somewhere someone that likely smokes will find them. So yeah. Iâ€™m proud I still am 25.5 days smoke free, but disappointed I littered.

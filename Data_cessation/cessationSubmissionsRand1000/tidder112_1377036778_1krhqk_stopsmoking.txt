I made it to 3 months, but in the past two nights I woke up thinking my dream of smoking a cigarette was real.

I was hoping that by the time I made it to the 3 month mark, I wouldn't be craving a cigarette anymore, especially in my sleep, ^where ^I ^am ^a ^viking.

I felt very guilty when I woke up yesterday realizing that I made a conscious decision to smoke a cigarette.  So much guilt that it felt like it really happened.  I was relieved when I had my coffee and put two and two together.

I still have times when I crave, not a cigarette, but a slight buzz that you feel after your first smoke of the day.  I am doing a lot more activities that keep my mind busy, and these cravings only come around when I smell smoke in the air, or see a friend take a puff.

I wish I was a non-smoker like I was when I was younger, instead of being an ex-smoker with that nagging feeling that I am missing something every once and awhile.  Even though this is an easy voice in my head to ignore, I can't wait for a full year to be under my belt, and perhaps I wont even remember or be reminded by my Stop Smoking App, that I am hitting these milestones.

If I don't post again in 30 days from now, you'll know that I am not thinking about it anymore.  Otherwise, see you all next month.

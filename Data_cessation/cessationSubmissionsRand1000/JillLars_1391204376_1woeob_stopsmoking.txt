Husband caved..need to stay strong

My husband and I both quit smoking about 2 weeks ago.  He had a slip last weekend and smoked 1 when he was hanging out at the bar with one of his friends.  In the past when I've tried to quit, he jumps on the bandwagon and decides to try too.  I obviously would prefer that he quits, but it bothers me when he just hops on the bandwagon because he decides to try it cold turkey, which has never worked for him, becomes a complete asshole for a week, and then starts smoking again.  He's normally the sweetest man alive, so the asshole personality when he's quitting can be pretty tough to deal with.  I'm using NRT which tends to cut down on my own dooshbaggery quite a bit.  

Anyhoo, just talked to him and he was hanging out with the same friend he had the slip with.  I jokingly asked him how many cigarettes he'd smoked and he fessed up that he bought a pack last night.  My immediate reaction is "oh, I want one too" and think about asking one of my co-workers to bum me a smoke.  I didn't give in yet.  Just wondering how the rest of you deal with it when people around you start up again?  I want to make this stick, and it's disappointing that everyone who quit with me is already right back at it (although, I've been there, I get it.)

Seven weeks. Still determined to succeed!

Seven weeks ago I didn't know if I'd make it through the first 3 days, but I did. Then I couldn't imagine getting through to 3 weeks. But I did. Now I'm a week off 2 months and I'm confident I'll make it. The Easter break is a 4 day long weekend here in Australia and we were spoilt with beautiful Autumn weather perfect for catching up on the gardening and trimming things up ready for winter. So imagine my surprise when all of my plans for hard work were almost derailed by cravings. I just couldn't seem to get motivated without my 'reward' - a cigarette after each task. So, I spent a lot of time on this sub reaffirming my dedication to stay smoke free and trying to remap my brain to not see a cigarette as a reward, but as a failure. Well, it's Monday night and I remain smoke free, with a sense of accomplishment and confident that I can do this, long term, forever. Thank you everyone that posts and responds. I've read every single one and you guys/girls are so inspirational.

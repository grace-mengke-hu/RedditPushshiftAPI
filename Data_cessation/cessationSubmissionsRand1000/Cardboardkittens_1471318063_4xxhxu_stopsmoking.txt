24 hours

So I just hit the 24 hour mark. It came sooner than I thought since I change my quit time. 

I am so proud of myself for this. I can't wait for the next 24 hours to pass.
It was easier than before. I had 2 cravings which lasted less than 5 minutes each. Which is surprising since everytime I tried to quit before they were stronger and longer.
I just kept busy, and keep reminding myself why I was doing this. And I stayed to non smoking places as well.

I got this. I know it.

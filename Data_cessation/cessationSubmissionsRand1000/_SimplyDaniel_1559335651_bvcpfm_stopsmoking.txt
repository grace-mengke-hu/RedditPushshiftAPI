I honor of No Tabaco Day. Day 0 - Day 116 taken 5 min ago. I moved places so I took the photo in the bathroom just like the original. But I feel like I could see a difference. I sleep, run, and no longer take naps as I did when I was smoking. Also, I wake up on the 1st alarm instead of the 7th! Lol

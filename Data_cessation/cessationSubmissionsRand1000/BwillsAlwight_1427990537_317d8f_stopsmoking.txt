My stupid brain is being stupid...

...So all week i've had next to no cravings, and all of a sudden today i was hit with a legion of niggling little thoughts "one would be okay".."maybe i'll just smoke at the weekend"..."a cig with a beer just has to be done!"...and it's really, really annoying. How do i stop my stupid, infantile brain from throwing a tantrum? It's like having a spoilt toddler living in my head.

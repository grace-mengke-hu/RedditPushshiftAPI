Struggling

Made it through a week but right now I am afraid that I will fail today or tomorrow. Tomorrow I have an important job interview and I am really nervous. Tension and boredom are my biggest triggers and tomorrow I will have to face both because I will have a lot of time between trains and I intend to be there quite early. 

Now I need to focus and prepare myself for the interview but all I am thinking about are cigarettes.

I was about to buy a pack but bought some Fisherman's Friend instead.

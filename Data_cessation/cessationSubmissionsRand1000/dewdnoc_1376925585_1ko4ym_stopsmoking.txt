Seven Day Badge

Well, here it is! I quit last Sunday night at 11:55 PM. I'll be honest. I've tried quitting before, and I could never make it past a few days, but this time I was determined. I even went out and drank over the weekend, just to show myself I CAN be around smokers, while I drink, and I don't have to light up! Thanks for all your support guys - I look forward to the road ahead, and waking up one day without the thought of a cigarette even crossing my mind!

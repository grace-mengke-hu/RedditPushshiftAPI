30 days, 1 month, I'm still here.

I have the fatigue and scars from a month of battling my addiction to cigarettes, and yet here I am, climbing from the trench's still standing still fighting. I hate cigarettes more than ever. This past month has been a roller coaster. Those first few days I would even put my fingers to my mouth and inhale deeply while closing my eyes, My imaginary cigarette simply felt...well more real that it should just further showing me the grotesque depths to which tobacco companies had me. Keep fighting.

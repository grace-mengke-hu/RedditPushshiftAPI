Today, no matter what, I will not smoke. Y'all with me on this? ;)

Work super busy, misc tasks at home to do, and my biggest trigger is on today.  

So I took a break to color...might do another color break later.  I'm focusing on what I CAN control and do at work...and most important is I ain't sacrificing my earned 19 days with something that's pretty damn harmful and poisonous.

How about y'all?  Want to join me and not smoke today?

TLDR: ain't gonna smoke, even thought life is a little rough going today.  Want to join me and not smoke today?

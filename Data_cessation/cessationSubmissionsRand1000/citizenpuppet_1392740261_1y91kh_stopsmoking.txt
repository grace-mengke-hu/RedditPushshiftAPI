Some great advice I read on here last week as a comment, which deserves its own thread

I'm 31 years old and have smoked since 18, have quit for three years before, and also 9 months last year, but ended up right back at it. I reached that breaking point last week where I decided to go cold turkey. I had read a version of the following as a comment, and it's really helped me get through the weekend, through the last couple days at work, and through the worst cravings I've ever experienced. If it works for one other person on here trying to quit, I feel like this thread was worth it: 

Imagine that there is a monster in your stomach, and that monster lives on cigarettes. The only way it can survive is by you feeding it cigarettes. When you stop cold turkey, the monster gets hungry, and starts kicking and screaming for more. You have to starve the bastard! It's not going to be easy on you. Like anything else, it will protest and throw a fit (cravings), but you must bring it to its knees. A few hours from now, or a few days, weeks, months, hell even years from now - that son of a bitch is going to start kicking again. Keep starving it. Every time you feel like bumming just one cigarette from a friend, you're feeding the monster, and he has a taste for weakness, and will begin feeding off of that, the weaker you get the stronger the monster gets. 

Starve the bastard! 

Oh, and also - don't drink while you're quitting.

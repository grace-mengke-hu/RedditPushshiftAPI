12 days no cigarette

Finally mu chest infection has gone! I'm still coughing up tar, but overall I have not had a craving all week. I have had thoughts of when I used to smoke, its crazy when you actually quit to see so many people in the street smoking. It really stinks. I really want to never start again, I know from many past experiences that it only takes 1 smoke to start up again. I wont smoke today.

Some things that have helped me so far:

Hi! I am 25 and smoked for 8 years at about a pack a day. I am 14 days into my nonsmoking journey and just wanted to share some little things that have helped me fight my cravings: 

-remembering that cravings only last about 15 minutes
-googling “writing prompts” and wholly focusing my energy on that for a while 
-pocky sticks! The chocolate ones melt in your mouth and then you can nibble down the biscuit part. Idk but it helps with my oral fixation soooooo much 
-always having gum on hand
-doing some light reading
-cleaning and/or gardening
-removing myself from toxic environments (seriously just walk away!)
-talking about it. If I try to ignore the fact that I’m taking on this challenge, everything gets worse. Plus I think it’s important for those around me (s/o, family, coworkers, friends, etc) to know what I’m working with so that they don’t take any residual crankiness personally

Good luck to everyone!

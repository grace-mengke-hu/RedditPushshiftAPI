Social smoking..

Finding it tough to stop social smoking, i don't crave cigarettes at all when im sober, but as soon as i have a few beers theres nothing more i want than a cigarette outside. I just enjoy the talking to random people, the break from being in a club/pub and even just being alone to clear my head sometimes. 

Have any of you'se been in this position? How did you stop?

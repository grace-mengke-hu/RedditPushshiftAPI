Welp, resetting my badge

I had made it to 200 days.  I've smoked probably a half pack this week, 1 or 2 a day.  I feel terrible and guilty, but also determined to get those 200 days back and then beyond.  

Point is, the 6 month mark is going to be hard, but if I had just stuck with it, I'd be well on my way to one year. Sucks...

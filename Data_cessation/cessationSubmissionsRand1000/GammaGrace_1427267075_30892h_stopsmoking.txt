4 weeks!!!

Everything is going great! I had a slip up over the weekend... It didn't set me back though. I think because I smoked to punish myself, not as a reward. It was still stupid, I do not recommend it.

I don't really have the desire to smoke. My brain just seems confused, though. Wondering why I don't just go smoke? The thoughts aren't super intrusive, but they are there all the time. I forgot why I quit. I think I come to this sub less because reading about all the bad cravings new quitters have makes me remember my strong cravings. 

Who knows what the future holds? In one day I will surpass my longest quit. In 2 I'll reach a month... After that, it's just a big empty space I have to fill.

Good luck to you all. Take a deep, fresh breath and believe you can do it. Because you can, duh. :)

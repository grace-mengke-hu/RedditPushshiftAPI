Does cessation of smoking bring down blood pressure?

Background: 18 year old who just quit today. Been smoking on and off for about 3 years. Early on I would smoke 1-2 cigs a day then 4-5 towards the end. Don’t exercise that much. Don’t eat that healthy however I’m not overweight. 140lb. 5’5

So I recently checked my BP at my local grocery store and it was pretty high. 143/86. One of the biggest reasons for me quitting was because of this. In years past, my blood pressure was pretty normal. I’m worried that this is permanent but at the same time I’m kind of confused how it would be considering my age. Will my blood pressure drop in the coming months being free from tobacco? I’m planning on exercising more and eating healthier. 

Thanks

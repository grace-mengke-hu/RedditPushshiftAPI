Traveling

I cant stop thinking about the idea of smoking while I am traveling. I am going to be going to India for 5 weeks and then traveling to the PNW after I come back to the states and I keep envisioning myself smoking a cigarette while looking at the Taj Mahal or drinking a beer while smoking outside in Portland. I know its weird but I just realized that traveling is a trigger for me and I am freaking out.

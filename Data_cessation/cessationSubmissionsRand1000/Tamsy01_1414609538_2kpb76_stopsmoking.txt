How long guys till u forget?

Hi all... How long is it until you don't think about wanting a cigarette any more? I've gone 10 days and I'm very proud but fed up that I still think about having a cigarette at least 10 times a day.... How long until I don't think about it any more? Winning by will power but hoped I'd not be thinking about it by now? ....

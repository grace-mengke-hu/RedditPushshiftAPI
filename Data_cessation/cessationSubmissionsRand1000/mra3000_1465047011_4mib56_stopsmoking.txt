woohoo 3 weeks

Made it to 3 weeks, feeling proud (flexes muscles)! Have to report that my normal 9AM trigger time/first smoke of the day no longer has near the sway it used to have on me. I still have those cravings don't get me wrong - but they are greatly diminished, and keep getting farther away in the rear view mirror. I feel great about it and look forward to more days free of the burden. I have so many more positive things that I do now first thing in the morning. 

My gratitude to everyone here!

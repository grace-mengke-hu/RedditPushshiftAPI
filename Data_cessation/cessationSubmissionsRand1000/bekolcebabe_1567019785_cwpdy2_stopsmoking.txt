Just got my follow up chest X-ray results-pneumonia resolved &amp; NO CANCER 😁 so relieved &amp; thankful! I know I doesn’t mean I’m risk free , but I’m never smoking again! I actually really don’t want to this time, unlike previous quit attempts . Nearly 1 month smoke free 😁😁🤠🤠

And it sure would have been way harder without all the support from you lovely people. Thank you all 😘😘

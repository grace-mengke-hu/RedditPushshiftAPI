I need your help

I smoke around 15 cigarettes a day. I am 31 and the most time I was smokefree was 2,5 years. 

I have tried twice the last couple months to quit smoking. Both times I failed on the second day of quitting. I had severe depression, irritation and a feeling of being tired.

I want to quit smoking, I'm not gonna lie here, because of my personal finance. I bought a car and I can't afford to buy packs of cigarettes. So, it's not just my health. I also feel that smoking makes me have less energy and I can't enjoy much activities like walking with my dog. I also feel guilty for smoking and my dog inhales the smoke.

Here's the thing... I have read about three times Allen Carr's book and it's a great boost but I don't have much success so far. I watch videos online, I educate myself but still no success.

I have two packs left, I want to smoke them but after that I really want to stop. What should I do when I have these triggers, these mind games because I feel weak. I have tried many things and how long do these symptoms go away? What do you do when you are having a bad day?

Thanks in advance.

Meltdowns, anyone?

I don't know what came over me today. 

I've been 12 days, cold turkey, no problem. Okay, I may have been a tad moodier (or noticed it more), but I haven't cussed a single person out. Today started out fine as well, then at about 11 o'clock, a co-worker handed me a pile of papers to sort, and I just started BAWLING. I've cried at my desk before since quitting cigarettes, but I've always been able to stop myself after a few seconds. This time, however, it was like the floodgates opened.

Thankfully, my boss is an ex-smoker who totally gets it. She told me I could take the rest of the day off (so I'm thankful for blessings like her, for sure). I just wonder if this is normal, or I'm just crazy. Has anyone else experienced this? I know irritability is part of quitting, but crying out of nowhere? How long does this insanity last?

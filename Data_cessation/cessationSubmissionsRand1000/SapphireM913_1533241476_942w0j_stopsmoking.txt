Halfway through Day 2 (try #9)

Using patches and lozenges this time. Yesterday I had 4 cravings, one of which was bad enough to warrant a lozenge, today 5 cravings and it's only halfway through. The things I thought would trigger them aren't doing so, however. So it's just one at a time, go to my toolset and pick what will work at that time. 

What's insane to me though is that my neighbors smoke (live in an apartment). They smoke feet away from my open patio door. I've always liked the smell of smoke, much like I like the smell of WD40 and gasoline. Probably part of what started me in the first place. So they've been outside twice today while I've been home and awake, and both times I smelled it, loved the smell of it, but had zero craving. Not arguing! Probably a good thing, because when I smell it in places I can't control it, I'm going to have to be able to handle it.

Realized this morning how much my life has changed for the better.

This morning I realized how far I've come in the last year and how it all started with quitting smoking 231 days ago.  Last July 5th I was hung over after drinking a six pack and smoking a pack of cigarettes on the 4th.  Still, I got up and snuck out of the house to drive around and secretly smoke several cigarettes (I was mostly a secret smoker), then spent the rest of the day looking for any excuse to do the same.

But this year is very different!  Yesterday I spent the day with my SO watching a parade and going to a street fair.  We cooked out last night and I had one beer.  Had a good night's sleep and got up this morning and went for a run.  (Yes, a run!  Never ever would have happened when I was smoking.)  Today I'm painting my dining room, washing my house's siding, and working in my garden rather than looking for any and every opportunity to escape my house and SO and go have a cigarette.

My life is so much better, and I am so much happier AND IT ALL STARTED WITH QUITTING SMOKING.  Seriously, that was the root of so many of my issues.  Especially being a secret smokier, I spent so much time planning my next chance to smoke, and everything revolved around getting away to smoke.  Now I am healthier physically, healthier in my relationship, I drink way less, and I'm so much more productive and fulfilled.  

Just thought I'd share.  Hang in there, everyone!  It's SO worth it!

1 month & 20 days feeling good

Come on here once a day, we are all in the same boat and it's nice to read how everyone is overcoming this horrible addiction we all suffer and come through it in different ways. I'm feeling like I can see the light at the end of the tunnel now. The withdrawals are just getting weaker and I'm getting stronger .Keep at everyone you can do it!

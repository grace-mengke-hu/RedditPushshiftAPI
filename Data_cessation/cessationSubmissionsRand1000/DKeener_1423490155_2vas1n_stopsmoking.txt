I don't want to seem like I"m bragging...

Ah..who am I kidding? I'm gonna brag a little.  80 days since I quit.  Was a pack plus a day smoker for 26 years.  And had pretty much turned into a couch potato.  Well today I ran 5k in 39 minutes.  I'm very happy with it, and just wanted to share with you guys!

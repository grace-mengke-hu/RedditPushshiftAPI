Cold Turkey - It's getting better everyday.

Hey guys, 

Quit Cold Turkey a few months ago, my life is so much better now...

I have smoked for 12 years, i'm 26 years old and its really awesome to be finally free!

The cravings will come and go forever, but its not as hard as it is in the beggining. dont get too crazy about it.

Just chill, workout, play videogames, study music, have sex, write, text, use your hands... for me, it was all about keeping my hands occupied.

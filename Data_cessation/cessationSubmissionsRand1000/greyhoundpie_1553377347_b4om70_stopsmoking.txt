Anyone experiencing vertigo? (smoke free 3 weeks, on the patch step 2)

Hi friends

I'm experiencing a bit of vertigo and I'm wondering if it could be tied to my nicotine patch (14mg). I've been on the patch for 4 weeks and smoke free for 3. Everything going good but I'm having vertigo on/off for the last 3 days. Strange tingling feeling in my arms and legs. Comes and goes. Doesnt feel nauseating or bad but almost like I'm a bit drunk/high. Only lasts for a few seconds. I'm wondering if I'm getting too much nicotine. I haven't worn a patch for the last 24 hours but nothing seems to have changed.

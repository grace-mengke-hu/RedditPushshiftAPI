That first thought...grrr.

Working on day 72 without so much as a puff and after about the 3rd week, I had pretty much stopped thinking about smoking when first waking up, but every now and then the monster creeps in.  This morning was one of those mornings- first thought was "time to get up &amp; have a cigarette".  I'll be so happy when those unconscious thoughts go away forever!!

Six Weeks

Just posting to check in.

I'm starting to realize that the anxiety I feel in the mornings

A) will not get cured by smoking, that is a bullshit addict thought.

B) comes from my own underlying condition of generalized low-level anxiety, which I've been dealing with since I was a little kid, and have dealt with through alcoholism, and sobriety, and smoking, and quitting.

So I have six weeks, and my cravings are down to about once a day. I smelled my housemate smoking and I had mega craving. Took a deep breath, thought about my life, and it went away in two minutes. Later tonight, I stood outside next to 10 people smoking and started gagging  uncontrollably. Same smell, different reactions.

No deep thoughts today. I'm just grateful I have as much time as I do, and don't want to take it for granted. I need to exercise more... but I can't run. I have a compartment syndrome condition in my left ankle, which prevents ALL long distance running. I can play sports on grass fields, and probably could bicycle... if I owned a bike. I really should go ahead and get a bike, so I can do free cardio without horribly injuring myself worse than I already am.

Much love to you guys. Thank you for providing a place for me to continue posting, and being 'needy.'

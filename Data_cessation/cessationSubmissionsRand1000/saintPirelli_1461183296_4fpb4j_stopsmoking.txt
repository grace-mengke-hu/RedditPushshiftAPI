Thank god, I finally got really sick

So until about 2.5 weeks ago I was a pretty heavy smoker. Roughly 20 fags a day. I could not go without one. Not even for two hours (unless I was sleeping). I was always the first guy at dinner to rudely stand up and get outside to have a smoke, I was almost always the heaviest smoker in the room. I half-assed some attempts to stop but never came close to even last a whole day.

Well, 2.5 weeks ago I caught a flu. A flu so bad smoking hurt. Like, really, physically hurt. So much so I just couldn't smoke at all. I decided to grab this chance by the nuts and after I started half-assing and "doing it just a little bit" again my flu **thankfully** came back. Today at 3 pm I am one week 100% smoke free.

11 Days, but I wish it were longer

It's great that I haven't had nicotine for 11 days, and I am super happy about that.  I just wish it was longer still.  I have some studying to do and I am a little distracted and don't concentrate well right now.  I assume that is part of the quitting. I like to think that if I was 6 weeks in or 6 months I wouldn't have the same problem...

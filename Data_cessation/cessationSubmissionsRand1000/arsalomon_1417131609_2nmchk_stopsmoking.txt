Finally made it past the two week mark!

Ok so I'm only at 16 days but still, in the past I would hit a wall at 13/14 days. I haven't had any nicotine for the last two days. I have my ecig loaded with nicotine-free juice just in case, but I haven't needed it the last couple days. So I guess this is what I'm thankful for today. I really hope this is it for me. 

Happy thanksgiving, y'all!

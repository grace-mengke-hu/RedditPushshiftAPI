Holy shit... I made it a week. Can't stop the quit train!

It has officially been a week since I quit tobacco and marijuana! I feel so proud of myself. Aside from one semi-successful quit of about 6 months (years ago), the longest I could ever quit was about 12 hours =/

I already feel the hold on me loosened drastically, cravings are way shorter and less frequent, and I'm coughing up years of gunk - which is strangely satisfying. I even hung out with my smoker friends and managed to not have any insane cravings or temptation. 

I was a hopeless addict of 10+ years. Even the THOUGHT of quitting would fill me with panic and fear. If I can quit, I feel like pretty much anyone can. 

Also a big thank you to everyone in this sub, and to badgebot <3
Even though I'm not posting as much as I thought I would here, everyone's posts and comments have helped me immensely. 

Have a great day everybody.

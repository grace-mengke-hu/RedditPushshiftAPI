A Fortnight has passed, and feeling all right

Yes my stop smoking friends. A fortnight of being nicotine free. The benefits are fantastic, food tastes great, can exert myself and not be winded, and best of all, have not smoked 239 cigarettes and saved $100.52 cents. If you are considering quitting, highly recommend you read Allen Carr's book and just quit...Cigarettes are doing absolutely nothing for you...

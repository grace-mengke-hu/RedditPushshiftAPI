Keep on doing what you're doing /r/stopsmoking !

Exactly one year ago I took a decision that changed my life. Thanks to all of you!

If you're at day ONE and could feel the way I feel about cigarettes right now, then it would be easier to just stick with it and quit. It was a bit rough for the first couple of weeks, but it got better real fast. I have completely forgotten I used to smoke 30 cigarettes a day for over 20 years. I'm never ever doing it again, that's for sure.

Being on this sub, talking to all of you, really helped me stick with it. Thanks for saving me from myself.

Having a terrible time get past a day at work

I know I can quit smoking. I know it. I read and understand Allen Carr. I quit in the past for years. In my head I totally get it. Here's the inevitable "but". I can quit on a weekend and get through withdrawal for a couple days, no problem. But then I get to work. New high pressure job. I have to be able to think hard. When the pressure starts, my head starts to buzz. I find it very difficult to think, unless I have a smoke. Yes it's the addiction finding a way back in. Allen Carr says that smoking does not help with anything. But there it is, I have to be able to think. Damn I wish this was behind me already.

Edit. I just read the following comment by Armison. Might help. http://reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/3ra5fg/coming_up_on_19_hours/cwmazyf

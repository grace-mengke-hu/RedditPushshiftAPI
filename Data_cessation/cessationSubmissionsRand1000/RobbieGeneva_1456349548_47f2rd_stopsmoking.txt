Fifteen days. No cigarette, not a one. BUT I am doing the Nicorette lozenge, new to this sub, you don't consider that cheating do you?

I have smoked longer than I care to admit, and I have never in all these years tried to quit. This is my first time, and I'm going to make it my only time I quit. Damn, if those pangs don't hit hard, but they do go away quickly! Anyway, thought I would share.

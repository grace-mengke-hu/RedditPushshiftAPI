Nearly broke down when I saw the star. 1 month advice and experience. 

12 year, pack a day, smoker. This shit is so possible. 

At days 1 through 4 (the hardest days IMO) I laughed at making it to 10 days. At 2 weeks I never thought a month could come. 

At a month now and 2 months seems very possible. 

I just want to let all the resolutioners know that it's very possible!!  This sub helps immensely...just a few pointers:

- Read the book everyone is raving about. The way he un-brainwashes you is exactly what all of zombified smokers need.

- Wait out the cravings. It will pass. DO NOT LISTEN TO YOUR BRAIN! Cravings do 1 of 2 things...pass or make you smoke one. LET IT PASS!

- Don't take quitting too seriously. Make the choice to quit and don't make a big old deal about it. I learned to shrug off the fact that I quit, even though this might be the best thing I've ever done. It takes the pressure off.


And let me tell you guys, being a non-smoker is fucking great. I used to never think it was possible to not smoke while: waking up, drinking coffee, after a big meal, before/after I shower, I pick up the phone, start driving, DRINKING ALCOHOL, before/after work, before I sleep, after sex or fapping, being stressed at work, relaxing, and the list really continues as I used to think I needed a cigarette during these times. Oh how blind I was. 

You guys GOT THIS!

I finish my NRT (patches) today and i’m a little nervous.

Being honest i still have a week of step 3 left (7mg) but I’m so over it i just want these withdrawal symptoms to go away quickly as possible. But then again i don’t want to come this far just to let the extra that the 7mg a day was keeping back get to me. 
I’ve never been able to get this far going cold turkey.

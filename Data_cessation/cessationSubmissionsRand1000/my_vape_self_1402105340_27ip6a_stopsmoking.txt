What was your experience with lethargy.

I have been nicotine free since 21 Feb.  Since dropping nicotine,  I've been sleeping an hour more a day and have been *very* lethargic in the afternoons.

How long does this last?  I realize everyone is different.  In searching, I see that many folk have the opposite problem.  So I thought I'd just ask.  I can live with the extra sleep, but I'd like to be alert when I am awake.

In case it matters: I quit using e-cigs and stopped lighting up about 5 weeks before I got to nicotine zero.  I am also working on giving up the vape, but my oral fixation is not troubling me right now :) because I quit smoking.  

Thanks for your time.

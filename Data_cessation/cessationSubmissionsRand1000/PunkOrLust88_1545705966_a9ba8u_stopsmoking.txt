Christmas Quitters

Any fellow Christmas quitters?  Have failed many, many times this past year to successfully become a non-smoker, but I want to start 2019 smoke-free with a week under my belt so gonna give it another real go tomorrow.   I’ll be with family all day, with not a single one being a smoker, so I figured I’d refrain for the day and take it from there.  As an English major, everything needs to be symbolic or have meaning, so I figured quitting on Christmas Day would be the best gift that I can give myself.

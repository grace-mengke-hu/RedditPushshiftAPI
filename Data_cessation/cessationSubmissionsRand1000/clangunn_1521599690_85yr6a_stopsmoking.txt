A thing that helped me quit

So, my biggest trigger was being at work where I had about 3 coworkers who would always offer me a smoke even if I hadn’t bought my own. You know how it is- work friends you smoke with and just shoot the shit.

Anyway. When I quit this time I emailed them a note saying I owed them 20 bucks if they caught me smoking or if I asked for a smoke AND they couldn’t ask me to smoke. :)

So far I’m 19 days in and the cravings at work have dropped off fast.

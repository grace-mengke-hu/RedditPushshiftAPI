7 months today, getting married!!

Hey there stoppers! 

So I promised myself, and my GF, that I'd been an ex-smoker for our wedding. I'm celebrating my 7 months clean of cigarettes by getting married! 

I wanted to thank you all, I've pretty much only been a lurker here, but you guys helped me more than toy think! 

Wish me good luck! I'll be married in 3 hours, and my breath will be good! :P

Keep on all of you, you are heros ;)

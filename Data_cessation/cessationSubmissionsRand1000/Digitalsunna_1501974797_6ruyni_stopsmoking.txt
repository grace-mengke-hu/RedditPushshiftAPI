Interesting conflict

Hi. I'm on my 12th day and am doing NRT (patch and mouth spray). I've smoked for 28 years, since I was 14. It's going good, I have my difficult moments but I have handled them with a variety of methods. Breathing, thinking about what I'm gaining, drinking a glass of water, etc and using the nicotine spray for the really difficult ones. 
I find it really interested, and at the same time scary, how integrated the habit is. I mean I'm not going through nicotine withdrawal but I still get these ridiculously strong cravings.
The interesting part is that even if I really want a cigarette I don't want to smoke. The thought of smoking disgusts me, the smell, the taste, the feeling of it. But I still want a cigarette. Anyone else experience something like this?

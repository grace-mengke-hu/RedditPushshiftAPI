I can finally taste chewing gum!

Being a smoker I always kept gum handy when the situation required it. Since I stopped I realise just how strong the taste was, I can feel the mintyness linger afterwards, it's amazing! Before I stopped I had some flavour just enough for me to know what I'm chewing but now I taste it all! I know it's such a small thing but it really showed me just how much damage I had to my taste buds. Not only gum but food tastes so much better.

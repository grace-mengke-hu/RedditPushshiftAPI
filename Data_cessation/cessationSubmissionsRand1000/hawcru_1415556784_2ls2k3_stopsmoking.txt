A victory!

Today, I'm getting packed an ready for a trip to Florida this week and I have this bad habit when I come back from a previous trip, to not take all the things out of my suitcase when I get home. In preparation, I make sure there is nothing currently in my suitcase and begin checking for hidden gems. In the smallest pocket, however, I find a near full pack of marlboro milds. With no hesitation, I threw them out. 

I say hidden gems because once I left about a hundred bucks behind in it. This time a pack of smokes. Not as good but a nice reminder of the progress.

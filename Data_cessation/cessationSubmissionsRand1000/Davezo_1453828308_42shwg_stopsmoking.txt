Day 9: Depressed

After overcoming the first few difficult days, I am happy to report that my cravings have gone down significantly and my mood has improved. Thank you to everyone on this subreddit for the assistance! However, I get quite depressed when I see other people smoking. I also get depressed when I imagine situations in my life with cigarettes being absent. For example, smoking when having a few drinks, smoking after a long flight or smoking after a meal at a restaurant. When I think about it logically, I know deep down that I don't want to be a slave to nicotine anymore and that the benefits of being a non smoker are far more important to me. My question is, does this feeling disappear over time? Or will I have to train myself to get used to this sense of longing?

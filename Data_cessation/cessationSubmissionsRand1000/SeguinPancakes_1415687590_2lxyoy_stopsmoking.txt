48 hours in...ish...

I haven't had (in my possession) a pack of cigarettes since Saturday. But, I'm a bartender and went out to smoke with a regular at work and regular co-smoker at my after work bar tonight. I still want to quite and I'm visiting my grandma tomorrow and think I will stay strong through tomorrow in terms of buying. I really want this to work and want to actually be done for good. Looking for help...really. I don't want to disappoint my husband again.

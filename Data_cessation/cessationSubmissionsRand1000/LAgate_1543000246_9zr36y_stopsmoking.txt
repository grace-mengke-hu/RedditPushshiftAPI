24 hours already

OK, I smoked for many years, but was able to quit by using Nicorette gum. Unfortunately, years have gone by and STILL addicted to the damned nicotine. Yesterday, I just quit. I'm just using regular gum. Cold turkey. Bought some Vitamin C too. I'm posting more for me as a way to work through these early days. So many of my friends have NO IDEA how addicting Nicorette gum has been as well as expensive as hell. I went through two 170 piece boxes each month. Crazy. Alright, enough of my saga. I'm doing it!

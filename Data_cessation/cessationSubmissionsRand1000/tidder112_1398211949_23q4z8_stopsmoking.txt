I am creeping closer to my 1 year badge, and after the first few hurdles I thought I was done with cravings... I was wrong.

I have been smoke free for 335 days, as I write this, and I haven't even had one slip!  I am proud of that fact, and I realized after my first few months away from the beast I was free from letting my mind wander and my temptation take over.  I didn't crave it, no matter if I saw or smelled it.  I even stopped staring at empty, littered cigarette packages on the ground.

That was until about a week ago, when the cravings started coming back.  I caught myself staring at a near intact, empty package of cigarettes on the ground.  I was at the dog park, and I almost asked two different people for a smoke.  I don't really understand why I wanted one so badly.  I have been good for such a long time already, why now?

Luckily, I have still not given into the cravings, I have not asked for one, or bought a new pack.  I don't think I will, but it's so strange.  I even stopped posting on /r/stopsmoking after my first months of quitting because I didn't need the reassurance that I am thankful, were available here when I needed them.

I post now, because I am so close to my first goal, and I just wanted to vent.

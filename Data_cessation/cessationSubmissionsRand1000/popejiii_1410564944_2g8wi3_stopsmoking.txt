54 days and going strong. Curious to see if anyone else experiences this...

I like to walk, so I do it a lot.  Lately though I get this panicky feeling that I'm forgetting something and I start checking my pockets.  It hit me yesterday that I'm making sure I have my lighter and cigarettes.  Ha! It's a pleasure knowing that those little fuckers are gone!

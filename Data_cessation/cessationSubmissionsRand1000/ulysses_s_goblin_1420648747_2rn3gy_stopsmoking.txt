To all my Midwestern quitters out there, via Chicago:

How jazzed are you that you don't have to go out and smoke in this cold? 

Each morning as I get into work, I pass the same older woman on her way outside for her 9am cigarette.  I saw her again this morning and she looked absolutely miserable all bundled up, heading out to get her fix in -2 degree weather, with a windchill of -25.
I'm so happy that I get to keep my fingers in my mittens this winter, and never again have to rationalize going out for "fresh air" when it is this dangerously cold.

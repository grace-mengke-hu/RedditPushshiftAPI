😪 I just miss it

Skiing one last day this season at Killington and I’m missing my apres ski smoke so badly. I know the association will break but it seems like there are endless situations where I miss being able to smoke.

Smoking became like a friend for the years a smoked. A very faithful friend, at that.

People post on here all the time: “you need to realize smoking doesn’t do a thing for you.” 

First of all, it does.’it relaxes me and brings me pleasure. I enjoy it.

Second of all, how am I supposed to “know” this? Do I literally know how bad smoking is for you? Yes. (Like, seriously, I know. My dad had a prosthetic trachea my whole life from throat cancer and later in life a tube in his stomach for eating). It’s just hard for me to care more about the long term than smoking. And I have nagging thoughts from when I was a smoker like “who cares if I live until 80? Do I want to experience being THAT old, or do I want to enjoy life now?” 

Pretty much the only benefit to me is that I’m less insecure about the way I smell. Other than that, I miss my habit. When does that go away?

Thank you!!!!

At 42 days I know I'm far from free, but I wanted to express my gratitude. For the first few weeks I checked my badge all the time. It was a great help to see the progress I was making. In addition to this subreddit I used the SmokeFree app. I have also posted many times on this sub and have taken to heart everything everyone has said. I wanted to post for those just starting out:

IT GETS EASIER. You go from checking your status every craving, to checking it to see how many days you've gone, to checking so you can tell people exactly how many days. YOU HAVE GOT THIS

I feel so free. THANK YOU!!! Thank you to everyone on this sub who has responded to my desperate messages, thank you to those who posted with problems I was also struggling with. Thank you to this subreddit for existing. You are all amazing, supportive, strong people and I wish the best for all of you.

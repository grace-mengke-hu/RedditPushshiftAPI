Almost through day 2, again.

2 hours shy of 48 hours. Back in April I quit for 42 days; however, a stressful personal issue was what I used to begin smoking again. I've smoked for 20 years, well over half of my life. For almost a decade, I did not know I was an addict. I believed that I "just enjoyed smoking." It wasn't until I was very sick that I realized that I was a slave. I got a craving and I really did not want to go smoke because I felt like crap. The craving grew into a beast and I caved. I did not want to smoke but I HAD to. I was horrified that this thing that I thought I had control over (I just smoke whenever I WANT, right?) was really controlling me. I have attempted to quit countless times since then. It wasn't until recently that I realized that I cannot ever have "just one". I believed the lie that after 42 days, I could just smoke one every once in a while. It has taken me, almost 2 months of daily smoking, to get my mind in the right place so I can try again. I was a nicotine junkie. I had to have my first cig of the day within the first 5 minutes. Even before my cup of coffee! Smoking was how I dealt with unpleasant emotions and situations. I used it to escape everything that I didn't want to deal with. Fun fact- all the bs was still there to deal with after the cig was done. I'm done coughing up crap every morning, being woken up because of hacking cough, getting sick all of the time, and spending my hard earned money on a stupid drug. It's time to stop lining big tobacco's pockets and start lining my pockets! Let's do this! Feels good to be at almost 2 days! One craving at a time!

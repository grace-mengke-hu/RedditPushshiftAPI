Went 4 months and I slipped up.. day 3 again.

I was doing good, never thinking about them at all. I saved around 500 euro! Mind and body were all round much healthier. Then I had a few drinks and before I knew it I was buying packs again. 

In my head I was thinking "No big deal I can quit again easily..it's so easy to not smoke."

Well here I am at day 3 again, a month or so of smoking later. Just had a full blown panic attack out of nowhere..

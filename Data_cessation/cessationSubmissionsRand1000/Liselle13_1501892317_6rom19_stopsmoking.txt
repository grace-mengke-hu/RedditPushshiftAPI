Sleeping in car tonight...still not going to smoke

Bad time at home with loved one who struggles with alcoholism, will be sleeping in car cuz I can't afford to stay anywhere else, devastatingly upset...but I'm not going to smoke.   

I'll freely go entirely off my "healthy lifestyle" routine...right now eating McDonalds, and I'm perfectly fine with that and fine with it being emotional eating, cuz eating better is about progress, not perfection.

Losing my 9.75 months of not smoking?  It'll be 10 months Monday at 130p.  I'm not giving that up.  Fuck alcoholism and all its shit and all it takes away, but I'm not letting that fuckin' disease influence me to give up my 9.75 months.

I am NOT fuckin' smoking today.  Y'all want to join me?

EDIT: shit...today i have a full 300 days clean - just saw it by my name when I posted.  Hell yeah.  I did that. Me and myself and I.  That was me.  Even with all the shit at home.  I did that and I'm gonna keep doing that, starting with today.

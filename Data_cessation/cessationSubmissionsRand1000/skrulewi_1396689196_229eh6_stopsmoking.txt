96 hours, post 5

Well, I made it through friday.

Today was a pretty major milestone for me. I went and played pickup ultimate frisbee for the first time in five months. My lungs were absolutely crying. The coughing fits led to near-vomiting. But afterwords, when I took a shower, shit just started pouring out of my lungs. Feels amazing.

I have a long way to go, and am committing to playing sports 3 times a week. I quit playing sports because of how painful it became to play while smoking. It was just too 'inconvenient.' Why work on my body when I knew I was just going to get less endurance, less strength, less skill? And it was going to hurt so badly every time I worked out? Just give up, right?

Yeah, I'm ridiculous. Give up the sports and recreation before I give up cigarettes. 

No more of that.

I also went to two parties, and realized that my self esteem around women is already a bit better. Me not smoking is a better version of myself. When I'm smoking I've always got a chip on my shoulder, some self-depreciating bullshit that I run about why I smoke, justifying it, playing it off, when in my guts I really never liked that I did it. It's time to put that away.

Anyways, two more posts to go before one week. Then I'll take a breather from the daily posts.

Thanks for reading.

Bereavement = Badge Reset

Reached 20 days and lost my Grandad. Had two packs since Friday. It's no excuse and I feel ashamed of myself; the polar opposite to the pride and sense of achievement I felt 4 days ago. He wouldn't want that.

BUT I'm not going to beat myself up! I've been telling myself all day that "I'm just going to smoke what I've got left, then I'll be a non-smoker again." But as I would often think when reading people posting stuff like that: why not just do it now? I've thrown the rest away. I hate the way I smell and need to get it away from me before it's too late! The energy I was enjoying only after 20 days has already dissipated. I don't want to get dragged back in!

I know what to expect this time and this has strengthened my resolve. Although I've got to go through withdrawal again, I'm excited to getting back to feeling accomplishment with every minute not smoking! Wish me luck!

Embarking on day 2

Just past the first day. have a general nervousness and slight craving, that is nothing intolerable but is constantly present. I had many thoughts of "come on just one". 
Especially after or while drinking coffee or seeing my friends smoke. 
My biggest fear is that if I do not have enough inner motivation, somewhere down the road I will cave again. 
But the focus should be on making it today. 
Rationalizations that my mind uses to try and get its fix:
1. Just one, you will start again immediately after it
2. It will help you concentrate and work better
3. It will help you lose weight and be skinny 
What I use for my motivation and to keep resisting these rationalizations is as follows:
1. It started as a casual habit and you have had this just one cigarette for at least 2-3 years. Time flies and the longer you smoke the harder it is to quit. Better quit now than 2-3 years down the road.
2. you will learn to concentrate well without additional help. learn to meditate and focus and control your mind.
3. with proper nutrition and exercise you will look way better than by smoking (and not exercising).

I still have a sense of loss, however. My biggest biggest problem is the illusion of the just one, or just very short term smoking.

Cravings, Lent, and Jillian Michaels

I had the absolute worst cravings this morning. I felt as if I was back at Day 3 again. I worked out, had breakfast, checked in on here, drank a lot of water. The craving passed and looking back now, it was probably 10 minutes MAX! 

Tomorrow begins Lent. I'm giving up alcohol and soda. And of course, got asked on a date for Saturday: dinner and drinks. Guess I'm DD, ha. But seriously, I don't think starting to date while giving up stuff for Lent in the best move. 

And, Jillian Michaels. As I have posted before, workouts are so much more enjoyable these days. Today, I finished all three rounds of my circuit training, able to breathe and feeling amazing. A lot of days, THAT is my biggest motivation to get passed a craving without caving. 

And it's been a while since I've worked out using a JM video and good lord, I still have to mute her and listen to music, LOL!

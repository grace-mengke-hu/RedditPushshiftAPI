Almost 5 days! Weirdly emotional?

Hi! :)
I've never been on reddit before but my quit smoking app (stop smoking by David crane - it's really good :)) told me to read some posts from this category and I got drawn in and thought it might be nice to join :)
So, my story is, I got into smoking via weed, decided I liked smoking more than I liked marijuana and smoked (both - but mostly normal rollies, only smoke weed when my friends do, I'm not that into it) for about 9 months, quit cold turkey for 6 months, didn't find it that hard but had the odd social smoke with smoking friends towards the 5 month mark. Did a bit more social smoking with my then girlfriend who was an even more recent quitter (like a month or two) - started to smoke more on my own the more the relationship sucked and then was in full blown smoker mode again by the time we broke up which was about 7months ago. So nearly another 9mo smoking and I've now quit cold turkey again.
I've found it even easier this time - it just feels right and like it's time to go for good. One weird thin though, the last couple of days, I've felt kind of irritable a lot which I expected at first but didn't come until now when I'm presumably nicotine free! And also, I keep thinking about her which is weird cos I was over her after a few weeks. We were only together 5mo so it doesn't even really make sense. Is this just a brain trick association thing? Or have I actually managed to suppress feelings through smoking for so long? I don't like it haha.
Also, I keep forgetting that I don't smoke now. I dreamt that I forgo and started smoking last night and I was so distressed by it. Glad to wake up and realise it was a dream! And that in the dream, I realised and threw the fag and packet as far away from me as possible :p

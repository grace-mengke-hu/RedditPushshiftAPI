It's day 3, I've never posted in this subreddit before..

I'm on my 3rd day without a cigarette. The first two days were pretty easy but today I can't stop thinking about having a fucking cigarette. I'm typing this a mile a minute and i'm making a typo like every third word and backspacing is annoying the shit out me lol 

just ranting here, trying to stay strong. I am sick of smoking cigarettes. I used to love singing and was an okay singer to boot, but now I can barely even talk let alone sing and I'm fucking sick of it.

I'm sick of smelling like cigarettes, I'm sick of tasting like cigarettes, I'm sick of my teeth being dirty, I'm sick of how they make me feel the next day after smoking a whole fucking pack, I'm really sick of how they've ruined my voice..

speaking of the voice thing.. does anyone know if the damage is permanent? or is it temporary.. I hope it's temporary, I wouldb e so upset if it is permanent :(

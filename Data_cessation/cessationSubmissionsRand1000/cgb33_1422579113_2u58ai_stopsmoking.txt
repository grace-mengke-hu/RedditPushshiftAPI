Arg!

I quit smoking using Zyban. I went through a load of crap near the beginning & stayed strong & didn't smoke. I've been off Zyban since Christmas & am now going through a stressful time at work. The cravings are coming back every day but thankfully I don't see myself as a smoker anymore & certainly don't want to go outside & freeze my butt off. Strange how one part of your brain/body can crave it yet another part is refusing it. 
Just needed to vent. Thanks for reading. Stay strong!

Suddenly coffee tastes weird.

I quit almost 4 weeks ago and I'm very happy with the progress I'm making. But the last five or six days I noticed something odd: coffee started to taste weird.

Not the cup of coffee I'm having in the morning at home. I'm writing my dissertation at the moment so I'm at the library pretty often and usually get a cappuccino in the afternoon. But it tastes weird. It tastes like fish.

I thought this was a one day kind of thing but the effect is persistent over the last days. I even changed the coffee shop because I thought that the milk was over date.

No change, every cappuccino or latte I drink tastes like fish. I guess it's the milk?

Did anybody else come across something like this? Is it possible that it is in relation to me quitting smoking? But the effects only started 3 weeks after I quit. 

I'm so confused.

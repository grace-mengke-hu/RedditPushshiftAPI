I made a list for everyone of all the things that a cigarette does for you.

1.  Make sure that you'll want to smoke another cigarette later. 

That's it. That's the whole list. Because that's the only thing that a cigarette does is make you want to smoke another cigarette later on. Well, I guess if you don't count killing you and making you smell like wide open ass. But everyone knows that. That's the trick behind nicotine. It doesn't relieve stress. It creates it through the process of restarting the cycle of withdrawal!  THE URGE TO SMOKE WILL GO AWAY WHETHER YOU SMOKE OR NOT!  But if you smoke, tomorrow is just another day 1 again. I'm tired of day 1's. I've had a million of day 1's and they all sucked. Break the cycle of addiction and freedom is yours!  I smoked for almost 20 years. Reading Allen Carr's Easy Way to Quit Smoking (twice) and watching Joel Spitzer videos on YouTube and whyquit.com helped me. I hope it can help you,too. That non-smoker is still inside all of us, and they really miss you!

Starting Over!

I went 58 days and then broke down and lit up. I smoked for four days in the early morning at at night. This past Saturday I again put out my cigarette and haven’t had a bad craving since. 
  After my relapse I bought Allen Carr’s book and wow did that make sense to me. 
  I am again 2 days in and feeling strong.

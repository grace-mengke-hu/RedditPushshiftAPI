This is the most confident I've ever felt trying to quit!

I'm 10 days smoke free! I haven't been smoke free for this long in almost 7 years... And I've smoke for almost 17 years, off and on. I watched Allen Carr's Easy Way video and (at the risk of sounding like an infomercial) I feel like it has completely changed me. I haven't felt a single craving... I don't even miss it. I don't know... I'm usually so skeptical of self-help videos. I watched this and it was like being reprogrammed. It's amazing to realize how much in television and movies had me primed to become a smoker. Seeing characters in stressed out moments, rushing out to smoke and appearing so relieved after a single puff. I can remember noticing that as a kid. 
It seems like it should be completely obvious that you get absolutely nothing from a cigarette. But for some reason, this video presented things in a way that just hit me to the core. I was able to hang out with my heavy-smoking friends this weekend and not even once feel the urge to light one up. I mean, we sat outside for hours just talking like we used to. The only difference was that I could breathe without hacking and gagging! 
I'm sorry that I don't recall the person that posted it, but I want to yell out a tremendous THANK YOU!!!!

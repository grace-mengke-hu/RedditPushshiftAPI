Eat and drink all the things

I'm 5 days going on 6 and I have absurd cravings to eat and drink soda. Chewing gum does nothing for me except make me hungrier. Pretzels, cereal, ramen, granola, trail mix, almonds... anything I can munch on I want it badly. I don't even crave smoking really at this point, but I could destroy food like crazy. I even bought three 2-liters of mountain dew for a dollar each earlier today and one of them is almost gone.

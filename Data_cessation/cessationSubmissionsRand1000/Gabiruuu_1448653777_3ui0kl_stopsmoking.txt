12 days and going out...

It has been 12 days without smoking. It has been ok. But last days I have been willing to go out for a drink with friends, and I always imagine myself asking a cigarette to someone, and have pleasure smoking it... Will I always be afraid to go out and drink alcohol? Will these wishes go away? I would really love to continue not smoking, but I really would love as well to go out and have fun as I used to.

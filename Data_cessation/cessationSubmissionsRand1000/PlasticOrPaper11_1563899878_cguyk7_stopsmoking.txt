Thanks for the support and the challenge.

I recieved 450 upvotes from people on here in support. I wanted a challenge and 450 days not smoking will definitely be a challenge. Obviously my goal is to quit forever, but we will see what happens. Thanks again for the challenge as well as tips and well wishes! 

 I'll definitely be coming here for support in the future. I'm only a few hours into the day but I'm feeling pretty good about this.

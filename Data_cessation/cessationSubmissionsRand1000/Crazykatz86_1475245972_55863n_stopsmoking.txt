On again/off again

Over the last month I keep saying I am going to stop smoking.  I've had enough. I've downloaded all the apps, bought the books am doing the research.  I make it through the first two days and then it seems like without fail by day 3 or 4 if I really try really hard I end up smoking.  The next day I immediately go back to trying to stop the cigarettes.  Sometimes I think the app hurts me in a way.  Instead of seeing the badges and being excited it just reminds me how long I've been without a cigarette.  Sometimes it's even my excuse "well I've made it further than the last time". Trying to find the willpower.

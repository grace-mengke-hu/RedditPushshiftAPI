Slipped up... Damn...

APRIL FOOLS, I HAVE A YEAR! HOLY FUCKING SHIT.


I fucking HATE clickbait, I do! I'm so sorry for doing it, but I just realized, holy fucking shit, I quit on April Fools day last year! I fucking made it! I'm going to post and make a fool of myself.

I fucking made it a year!

I'm in 12 step recovery for alcohol and drugs, been sober from booze since 07/22/09. But all my friends in that program either are constantly quitting/relapsing on smokes, or vaping, which isn't my game. This is the place I went to to get off of smoking one year ago. Thanks for letting me post here.

I posted every single day for a week, then every week for three months.

My danger zones? 3 days, 3 weeks, 3 months. I've relapsed many times at those 3 marks. The 3 months was the hardest. I struggle still with 10-20 second cravings every few days, but they vanish surprisingly quick. 

Anyways, I posted on everyone's post with 1 day today. Fuck yes, April Fools day. I was told that at 2 years the tiny little cravings are pretty much gone. So I'm really looking forward to getting that two years, and seeing what that feels like. 

HAPPY APRIL FOOLS, HOLY SHIT.

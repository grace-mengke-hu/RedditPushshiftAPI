I'm on Day 7, and I found a couple of things that really helped me through the first week.

The first is, I downloaded a pdf file of Joel Spitzer's book, Never Take Another Puff (here's the link http://whyquit.com/joel/#book ). Whenever the cravings got too much, I would read a chapter or two. He explains a lot of the physical things that happen in your body, such as why it seems like smoking helps with stress. It doesn't, it's a chemical reaction that makes us think it does. Understanding this, and a few other physical symptoms, really helped me ignore those cravings. The other thing that helped, was the Smoke Free app. It also helped when I was going nuts with the cravings. And, just one more, slightly ridiculous thing - I normally put some music on while I clean my house. This week, I decided that I shouldn't put my normal music on, as I thought it might trigger cravings. So, I put some country music on instead. As the songs of unrequited love, and 'why did you leave me?' type songs came on, I imagined I was singing them to the cigarettes! It made me chuckle, and also helped to see how ridiculous dependence on nicotine really is. Not sure if it will help others -maybe I'm going crazy, lol. It felt like I was a few times. But the cravings have eased off already, and are easily ignored. I'm determined to stay off them! After 40 years or so of smoking, it's time, I think. Wish I'd done it sooner. It's not as bad as I thought, though maybe I'm more determined this time, than the other times I'd tried to quit. Still, it's early days, so I don't think I'm out of the woods yet, but the trees are definitely thinning!

Today at 10:30pm...... Is one year

And wouldn't you know it, I had a smoking dream last night! First one in months. 

I can't believe after 20 years and up to a pack and a half a day I kicked smoking. 

Thank you all for your comments! I wants to add that when I started this journey, all I had was the hope that if be able to kick smoking. It was tough, but it got easier. For those in the early stages, just stick with it

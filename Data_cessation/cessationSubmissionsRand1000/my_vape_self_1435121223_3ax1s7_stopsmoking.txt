Find your ground. Touching base with the lurkers.

I've seen some posts that take me back to when I quit.  I remember how I felt.  You might not feel this way.  But I was pretty alone.

I have also been watching people who were a couple of months behind me hit their one year mark.  I feel breathless and so honored to see it happen.

And I have seen the posts, this weekend, where people wonder what happened to their safe place. 

ouch!  I will boldly speak for the entire sub.  Our most unthinking, uncaring, members never wanted to do that.  The rest of us are a smidge embarrassed.   And this real life stuff is messy.

[This is the post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/2z0m74/i_am_not_smoking_today_for_the_circle_two_badgers/) that is in the front of my mind.

Tomorrow I will honor all the lurkers who are looking for us to do a better job.  I will try to be worthy.

I can't believe how far I've come

It's been 2 months and 6 days now and I forget sometimes that I was even a smoker. I made it through the most trying time where I thought I might trip up in August. Working a stressful job and doing a 100 hour week. Got through it and life went on, so I know I can get through anything. 

I still at my one job go stand with the smokers but that's mostly because I miss the conversation with others. I probably won't be doing that once winter occurs. I'll keep trucking on but so far so good.

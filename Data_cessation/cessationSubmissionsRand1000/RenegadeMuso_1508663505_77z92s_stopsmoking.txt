Ok folks....truth is, you can do it too!

It gets easier...days become weeks, weeks becomes months, and months become years.

The cravings become few and further in between as you go along. The cravings will still pop up now and again, but...your mind and body will be stronger to simply reject the notion of lighting one up. In fact, the idea of smoking will become strange and even foreign to you. 

make the decision everyday that you will remain quit....no matter what happens! I quit under stressful conditions...and i could have buckled under the pressure...but...stay quit! 

You can do it! We believe in you!

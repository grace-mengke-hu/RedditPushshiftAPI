Pack a day for 19 years

Hi all I stop in this subreddit every now and again just to read posts from people that are just starting their Journey to remind myself where I came from and how hard it was at first 

I thought I would offer just a word of encouragement and also something that I learned that helped me a lot through the process. I would like to say that I no longer have cravings but every now and again I have nostalgic thoughts of smoking that quickly pass I would not even compare them to a craving though they are just merely a passing thought. 

Anyway what helped me was learning that every time you get through an experience that you were used to smoking while you did such as driving in the car or going through a weekend off of work or a season change/weather change event. Etc. Everytime you go through one of these experiences without smoking associated with it it gets easier and easier. I remember the first time I went through the weekend without smoking and it was really bad but then the next one was easy. All those cigarettes I smoked in my car while driving, and now this many days in I don't even think about smoking while in the car. 

Anyway I know this turned into a wall of text but hope that made some sense to somebody and can help somebody quit believe me I know everybody says this on here but if I can do it you can too good luck to all.

 I will not smoke with you today.

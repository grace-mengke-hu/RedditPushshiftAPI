I just want to scream!

Good grief! I haven't had a craving this bad in weeks. I'm a terror. A whiny terror. Ughhhh. Thankfully, my hubby is supportive. He said, "Let's get you settled in bed and get your group." Good man. 

So, I'm here. I'm with my group. Let me think about this. I was agitated this evening, that may have set me off. I can't think of anything else that would have made me feel this way. And I'm not obsessing about smoking, but I am obsessing about how I feel. And my head hurts, like it's been too long in between smokes. This feels like withdrawal all over again, even after 84 days.

Short of going to bed, I have no tools for this particular feeling. I've experienced this two other times and it was just miserable and went on for hours. Any feedback or tips? I have gotta find something that eases this.

EDIT: 20 hours later and I still feel like I'm in the first 72 hours of quitting. It's so strange. I ate and that helped a little, I did a breathing exercise and that helped a little. Next, I'm just going to go to bed and hope I don't feel this way tomorrow. Thank you for your nice messages, ideas, words of encouragement. I really needed that.

The monster is always lurking...

Today is Day 25. I want to smoke. So bad. It came out of no where and the urge is SO strong. I wont do it because having made that mistake on day 6, and becoming so sick and unfulfilled,  I know that smoking will not help anything. It's just crazy how strong these urges can be, and how suddenly they can still stop me dead in my tracks. 
It's so stupid but my addict brain has me convinced that I should smoke "because no one is ever successful the first time, and if you slip it's okay because every one does. You can start again later".. Seriously I just spent a solid 30 minutes telling myself it's okay because it's expected.  
Like seriously WTF is that crap.  NO it's not okay.  Only losers smoke and my 25 days is important to me. 
So here I sit seriously having this huge conversation with myself (yes I'm bat Shit crazy but that's for another story lol) to smoke or not to smoke...  Dammit!  This never ends does it!?! I had gotten pretty comfortable as a non smoker and today's challenges only reminds me that I have to Always be vigilant and strong.

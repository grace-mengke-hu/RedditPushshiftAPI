It's been over two months!

I'm feeling pretty great. I'm still using an e-cigarette, but have dropped down in dosage of nicotine.

I keep having dreams where someone is offering me a cigarette. I take it from them but before I light it I realise that I don't smoke anymore, so I don't need it, and I hand it back.

My sense of smell is really coming back. Everyone either stinks of smoke, or smells of soap...

Feeling really good. I don't have cravings anymore. My focus now is cutting down on the nicotine in my e-cig, and cutting down on how often I use it.

Also, my partner is quitting too (he smoked for 15 years) and he hasn't had a single cigarette either. I'm super duper proud of him.

25 days in and just got the smokers cold

I feel miserable, I’m tired, aching and have the worst headache. No cravings today for the first time EVER. I’m pretty excited about that! I think I might just be able to do this not just yet and maybe not tomorrow but I can do this. How long did the cold last for you? How did you kick it?

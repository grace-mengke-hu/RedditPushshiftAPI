The boredom cue. My worst reason

I've quit on and off over the past 3-4 years. The most i've gone is about 5 months, sometimes 2 or 3 months, sometimes just 1 month stretches.

All is good when i'm off them, happier, healthier and more smiley. But time seems to go slowly. especially in winter - time is a drag.

And there's nothing more pleasurable to fill that time than drawing the odd cigarette or 2 for me sometimes. But then I end up back in full blown addiction - unfortunately I can't stop chainsmoking when i fuckin start back.

So pissed off at these things. I'll always have the urge to smoke. What the fuck do I do

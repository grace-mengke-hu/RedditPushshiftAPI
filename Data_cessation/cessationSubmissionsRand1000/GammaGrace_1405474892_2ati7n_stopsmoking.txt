How to make the empty feeling go away.

Quite simply, I feel like I can't get enough air into my lungs. I'm not asthmatic, I just feel like no matter how much I breathe, the air isn't satisfying. I am trying deep breathing, but it almost makes it worse. I feel like I have twice the lung capacity now and I don't know what to do with it.

In other news, I feel like I've gotten over the worst of it. I don't really even think of smoking now. I'm starting to sit outside and just enjoy it, instead of inhaling poison. My next step is to start moving more. I bet that will give these lungs the workout they need.

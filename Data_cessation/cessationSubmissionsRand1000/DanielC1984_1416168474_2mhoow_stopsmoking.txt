Feeling proud

My manager is quitting work and there will not be a replacement until next year. The stress has been put on me big time. But I didn't smoke. Thought about it but I used a lot of mind strength to get through this difficult time.
Went out with friends who smoke. I still didn't smoke. And didn't want to either. Feel like I can do this. Just mustn't forget the feeling that got me to quit or get too complacent.

I want to be tobacco free by my 19th birthday

I have been smoking cigarettes since I was 13 years old. I always told myself I would quit before I was 18, because being legally able to buy packs would be 'the point of no return'. 

Well, I quit smoking cigarettes at 16 but started again at 17. Now I'm smoking every day, and it's become a serious problem. 

I smoke when I wake up. I smoke before I eat. I smoke after I eat. I smoke when I'm stressed. I smoke when I'm having ANY emotion. 

Reddit, I want to quit while I'm young. I want to be able to quit before my body starts getting so old that it's harder and harder for my lungs to recover. 
I want to be able to run again. Sing again. Taste again. Breathe again. Smell good. Feel good. 

And most importantly, I want to escape the financial and social prison that cigarettes has placed me in. Almost every dime of my very small amount of money goes towards smoking. 

I woke up this morning and haven't lit a cigarette. I made a cup of tea instead of coffee, because I associate coffee so much with smoking. 

I have the Allen Carr book. I think I will do it this time.

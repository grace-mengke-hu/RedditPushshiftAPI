Fear of smoking

I was just watching this movie and the guy was asking what was your greatest fear at the first thing that popped into my mind was 'fear of smoking again'. I know that I have quit and I am doing pretty well but I have craves on daily basis.I keep fighting the urges and sometimes they are pretty strong.I am getting at a point where I am getting a bit frightened of cigarettes that what if in a weaker moment I am pushed and I blew my quit.I know that I am going to stay strong but still this thought keeps nagging me and I do get scared.How do I rid myself of this fear? I need help please .

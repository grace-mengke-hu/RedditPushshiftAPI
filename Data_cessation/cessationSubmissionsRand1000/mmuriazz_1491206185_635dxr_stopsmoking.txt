Worst day yet

It's day 13 for me today and it's fast becoming the worst day yet. I'm tired, irritable and can't seem to focus. All I can think about is how having a smoke would resolve all my issues.  I suppose that's the addict brain trying to override the logical thought that starting again now would undo all the progress made so far.  I just didn't expect this to be so fucking difficult.

Today and tomorrow I shall not smoke for the lonely.

I am ramping up on my one-year.  It is quite spiritual for me.  So this is my version of the drunk post.

Today and tomorrow I shall not smoke for me. But I shall honor the people who feel alone and discouraged.

Let me stand with you today. You honor me.

I failed, but now I am succeeding!

I started Chantix a little over two weeks ago.

I completely missed the stop date that was in the pills instruction kit (1 week after starting), but I am now six days without a smoke.

I've had some very vivid dreams, but no nightmares or other side effects from taking it. For that, I'm very thankful.

The key thing that has kept me motivated is my buddy Derek. He is a lot healthier than I am, and he swore that on the first of February, he was going to swear off of soda on the 1st of Feb. So I told him if he could stick to it, I'd stop smoking as well. 

We have different cravings, but we're both in this together. Having someone to complain to does help, which is why this subreddit is so popular.

I've had quite a few cravings lately, but I've battled them and won. It doesn't hurt that I'm in Nebraska and it's below zero outside. It's kinda awesome to not worry about putting on a coat and braving the cold for five minutes at a time just to feed my addiction. Every time I get a craving and avoid it, I revel in how warm and comfy I am.

I also picked up the Game of Thrones series on my Kindle, so that keeps me glued to my seat and not watching the clock. I think it helps to have something to distract my mind. Otherwise I'd get bored and decide a smoke would break up the day.

Thanks all who have posted. You've made me strong, and I hope to continue on the path I've started walking.

I am a NON SMOKER.

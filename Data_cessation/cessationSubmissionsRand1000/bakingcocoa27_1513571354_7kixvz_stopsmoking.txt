Skin is a new, fresh, vital color (23 days)

29 years old, smoked a pack a day for about a decade.  Quit 22 days ago, and my skin is a different color.  I feel so much more confident smiling. It’s gross, but zoom in on the small pic (from about 2 months ago, or 5 weeks before I quit) — my skin is destroyed.  I’m so happy that some repair has started.  You can do this!

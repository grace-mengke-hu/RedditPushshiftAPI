One month! Ready to start 2018 as a non-smoker

Thanks for all the support.
I stopped smoking exactly one month ago besides having a lot of shit to deal with at the time. That's what I am even more proud of, I resisted the urges caused by emotional rollercoasters that made me give in in my first 3 month attempt this year

Even though you may fail once at a time, you'll learn something new for the next try, never stop trying folks and thanks for all your support.

Now onto the next month

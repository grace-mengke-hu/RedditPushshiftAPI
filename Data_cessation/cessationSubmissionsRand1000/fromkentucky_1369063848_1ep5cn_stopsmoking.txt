Realized something today about cigarettes and vices in general.

They aren't crutches. I found opportunities to integrate smoking into my life as a crutch, but at no point did I ever actually need them. Furthermore, integrating them into my schedule and routines only created more stress that reinforced the habit. Only after realizing that was I able to see them as parasitic, not symbiotic, and only then could I walk away from them.

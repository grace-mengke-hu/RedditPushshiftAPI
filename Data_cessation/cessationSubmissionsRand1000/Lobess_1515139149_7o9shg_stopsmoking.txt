One year 10 days

After a 31 year smoking addiction I made a choice that has landed me here, one year 10 days as non smoker!  Here is what worked for me:
1.  I mentally prepared myself to accept that I would feel discomfort in order to heal my body.
2.  I watched (quite obsessively) utube videos of people who quit smoking.
3.  I watched an hour long presentation on utube Allen Carrâ€™s stop smoking program at least twice.
4.  I used the patch on and off for two weeks. 
5.  I ate what ever the hell I wanted and kept gum, hard candy and twizzlers handy. 
6.  I bought metal straws and drank a ton of ice cold water and naturally flavored waters.
7.  I journaled, self talked (you can do this, fuck those cancer companies, your stronger than the sticks etc.) joined a gym, did meditation artwork, listed to hypnosis cds, wrote down reasons I was quitting over and over.
8.  I prayed
9.  I slept a lot
10. I recognize how proud I was of each accomplishment and tracked those accomplishments using the stop smoking app.
11.  I visited here, Reddit stop smoking page and thought, one day it will be me, one year clean and free.  And I am, free.

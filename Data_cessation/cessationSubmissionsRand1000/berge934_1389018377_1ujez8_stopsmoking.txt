We are experiencing a -20 degree winter morning in Minnesota today. I woke up put on some winter gear and headed to snap fitness. I was the only one there. I ran and lifted like I was 20 years old again and it felt amazing, but not as amazing as gloves....you see I never wore gloves when I smoked. They got in the way of using a lighter, holding a cigarette, etc. I am not going outside for a smoke break at all today. I wont have to suffer this weather to smoke a single cigarette. Good Luck all and stay warm.

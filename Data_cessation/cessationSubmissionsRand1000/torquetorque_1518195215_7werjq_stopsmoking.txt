Put the patch on today for the first time

Heyo!

So my quit date isn’t for 12 more days but I decided to try a patch today just to see what it feels like, try to take some of the drama out of the quit date. The program that I’m in allows for the use of lozenges on top of the patch if you want/need to, and also, if you really get desperate, having a cigarette. Of course the idea is that you run through your list of craving coping strategies before resorting to that latter option! 

I’m not finding the cravings to be overly physical but damn if those mental ones aren’t coming fast and strong. It’s those “time for a smoke! No it isn’t!” conversations with self that are fairly annoying. Part of my program too is to record every craving: where you are, your mood, the strength of the craving, and what you did to address it. My spreadsheet list is getting long already haha: 10:14 am, 10:17 am, 10:39 am, 11;07 am... ah well, I know they will slow over time. And if it gets overwhelming this week that’s ok, i’m already ahead of my quit date. I’m kind of glad I’m doing this little exercise because it helps my anxiety to not have to say “I can’t smoke”,  but rather, “I can smoke if I need to, I’m just going to do a few other things first and see if the urge passes.”

Anywhoo, number 6 on my craving strategies list is: post on stopsmoking! Sooo you might be hearing from me more frequently than one might prefer for a while. I don’t have people to talk to in real life other than at appointments, so yeah, this is my “talk to a friend” option. 🙃

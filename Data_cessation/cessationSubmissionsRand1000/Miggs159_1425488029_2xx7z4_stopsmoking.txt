anddddd I smoked....

Smoked after 9 days just because I wanted too. I consciously knew that I was about to do it. But I was okay with it. I guess I already lost but I'm also not as mad at myself as I thought I would be. Part of me thinks I relapsed because I smoked a blunt the other day maybe I got too into the oral fixation that comes with smoking. Time to set a new quit day I guess right? What do you guys think about Cannabis and Cigarettes?

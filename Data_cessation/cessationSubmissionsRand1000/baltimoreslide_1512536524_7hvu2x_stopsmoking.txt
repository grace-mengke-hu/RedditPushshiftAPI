Quitting-related depression

Hi fellow quitters,  
Struggling with quitting-related depression here. 
I quit about 7 weeks ago, but i screwed up and smoked a couple cigarettes 2 days in a row 10 days ago, hence my badge.  
Despite my screw-up 10 days ago, I'm not at risk of relapsing right now. The idea of smoking at this point makes me wanna barf.  
However, WOW, the chemical depression, ouch.  
5-HTP hasn't done much for me yet (I've only tried it the past 3 days) and I'm thinking of adding L-tyrosine, which I've heard helps more. At this point I'd kinda do anything to feel normal-ish. The whole world feels bland and I periodically get cripplingly painful waves of "everything is awful," self-hatred, etc. etc.  
I know it's just chemical but damn.  
This is further compounded by the fact that I have chronic injuries that right now are preventing me from exercising easily (I can't run, bike, or take a long walk due to knee issues, and won't be able to afford a gym membership for pool/etc. access until after Jan. 1).  
I'm trying to come up with some ways of managing this and trying to find the motivation to manage it. But I seem to have about an hour of productive time each morning before my mood totally crashes.  
  
There isn't really a question here -- but if anyone shares this experience and has feedback or advice, I am all ears!  
  
Thanks, fellow quitters!

I started smoking again and now I'm super depressed

I went 41 days without a cigarette. After the first three weeks my body kind of reset, and by day 30 I actually felt about the same as I did before I quit. Low-energy, grumpy, yada yada. Maybe thats just who I am. Need more exercise, alright let's do it.

I dont know what happened in my brain on Day 41. I was invited over for beers and hotdogs, and within 30 minutes of being there I bummed a cigarette. And then another. I smoke 4 by the end of the night.

The next day I felt like garbage. "Oh man, not gonna do that again."

By noon I had bought a pack. I was almost forcing them down in me. I felt like terribly sick the rest of the day, and at around 6 i through the pack out, took a nap, and then went out with no problem.

I did the same thing Sunday, and Monday.

I havent had one since Monday night but my mood is spiraling out of control. Im incredibly depressed about basically everything and am barely holding on to the idea of not smoking cigarettes.

My brain keeps telling me "at least until Im out of this funk."

My job is boring, my dating life is shit, I dont ever do any of the cool projects I say I am, Im slowly getting older and fatter and lazier, and every time I stand up to all of that I eventually fall down and it all gets a little bit worse for the long run.

Happy birthday to me!

Originally I posted that it was my goal to be tobacco-free by my 19th birthday. 30 days ago I quit cold turkey and haven't looked back. 

Clean lungs is the best gift I could've given myself. I'm so excited. 

Thank you, /r/stopsmoking for all your encouraging words! You've really helped me :) 

And here's looking forward to the next 30 days, the next 30 weeks, the next 30 years, the next lifetime! Without smoking. :)

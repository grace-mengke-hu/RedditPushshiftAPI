The three-month itch came early

I don't know if it's the cooler weather, or that I'm overtired and stressed, but Scumbag Brain won't shut up. "You've quit!" it says. "Almost three months! Congratulations! Now it's definitely safe to have just one. Or buy a pack, throw it out when you've had a few! Wouldn't it feel great? DON'T YOU DESERVE THIS?"

I'll get through it. I got through a late night show with my hard-drinking band, got through stressful and boring days at work, got through weeks of cravings so bad they made me dizzy. I just kind of wish Scumbag Brain would stop bringing up the smokes, because in the short term? That cigarette would be so good.

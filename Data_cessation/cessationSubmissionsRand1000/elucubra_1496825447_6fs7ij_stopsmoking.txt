11 Days. I only have minor urges when in a social smoking environment. I think I'm starting to win the first battle (of many in this war) against this crap.

Not the first time either. I know the mechanics. I have been smart enough to quit (for longer than a year) three times already, and dumb enough to start again twice, so I know how my mind and body works regarding tobacco addiction.  

Re-reading Carr's book hasn't hurt. Refreshing the concepts helps.

To all of you just starting to quit: Hang on. It gets massively easier very soon.

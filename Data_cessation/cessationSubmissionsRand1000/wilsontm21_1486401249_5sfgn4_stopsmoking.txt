The smells...

I knew that my sense of smell and taste would improve once I gave up the habit. What I was not prepared for was just how much! I feel like I have a pregnant lady's nose with everything that I'm picking up now. It is wonderful and awful at the same time. I am enjoying food so much more. However, these bad smells are killing me, especially because I work in a veterinary hospital...

The only solution for me is to not drink heavily

For years I've reset the badge. It's getting old. Thankfully there's only 1 obstacle. It's no problem these days to go weeks or a few times over a month without a smoke. But these nice nights on a patio with friends and a six pack tends to result in bumming smokes. And once I start I don't stop. It's weird. I can say it's 100% resolved but a week later proves it isn't. Just can't drink more than 3 which isn't that hard to do. So here's to not giving in to more than a few here and there at home until I hit a record 50 days. It's also nice to get a $10-$15 tab rather than a $40-$50.

Just a thought.

New non smokers. Maybe this Pokemon Go thing could be the perfect distraction. I have been playing it the past few days and like most people I'm super addicted. This morning I thought it would of been awesome to have something like this within the first two weeks of quitting. I have an ADD like personality - need constant stimulation. 

This isn't some paid endorsement. Not trying to make Nintendo more money (like they need it). Just legitimately think it could help people get out of their houses and their head. Just go walk around like a dork. It's sort of fun. 

Good luck and stay strong! 

Edit: Typo. Doug this on my phone is always a challenge. I bet there are five more that I don't see.

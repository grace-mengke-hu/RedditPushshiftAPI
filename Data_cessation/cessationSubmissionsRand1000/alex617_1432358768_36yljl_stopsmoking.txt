Realized just how much I used to rationalize smoking

As someone who spends basically every weekend at a nightclub or bar I'm constantly around smokers, and the 'smoke area' is possibly the most enticing place in the world when you've had a few drinks and want to get social. That was my biggest concern, how can I really resist smoking when I'm drunk and want to be social?

Well, I realized that in my case, the best 3 years of my clubbing/partying life was a non-smoker (non-drug user). I actually somehow managed to be more social and confident than when I started smoking. That actually became my 'escape', if I'm anxious, bored or just want a high, just go chain smoke myself into oblivion.

The secret really is to accept whatever will happen as a re-missive smoker. The first few times things won't be the same, or they will be more boring, but after a while you will develop new habits, possibly exciting ones to enjoy life as a non-smoker.

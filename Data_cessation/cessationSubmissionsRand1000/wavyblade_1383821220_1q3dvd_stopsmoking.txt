hahaha, even my dreams wont let me smoke.

Had a dream where at the counter of a Cafe I was frequenting they sold individual cigarettes.  Well I'm up there paying my tab getting ready to leave and see the little bin with smokes, it's got a price tag on the bin but *I couldn't quite read it*..... I'm thinking here "hey, have a smoke, there they are, you can just buy *one*"  by this time i've payed my tab and the main cashier has turned around doing something else ignoring me, so I ask a guy to my right "How much is one of those smokes?  I can't read the sign"  to which he ominously replies "Oh! their price is much too high. . . . "  I walked out, and woke up.


well that's it.  Just a funny little dream where I think I talked to my deep subconscious and it reminded me of the real price tag on that bin of smokes.

One of my main reasons to quitting smoking is the weight gain. Anyone else?

Hello.

I'm very underweight and a pack a day smoker for 5 or so years.

The moment I heard that one of the "downsides" of quitting smoking is massive weight gain in a short period of time it was as if I found a pot of gold buried under my chair.

Of course it's not the only reason but I would be lying if I said it's not the main one. I'm renewing my Gym membership today. Time to put on ALL the weight.

Anyone else with experience on weight gain after quitting?

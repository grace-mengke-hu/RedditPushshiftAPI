2 Weeks Smoke Free

So happy and proud of myself for what I have achieved. This is by far one of the best things I've ever done. I feel so much better in myself and I have had such a confidence boost from it. It has been really tough at times but I have gotten through it. Start at the gym on Monday and I have bought myself some new clothes with the money I have saved from not smoking. I'm never going back to being a slave to the cigarettes again 🏋️‍♀️🏋️‍♀️🏋️‍♀️🏋️‍♀️🏋️‍♀️🚭🚭🚭🚭🤸‍♀️🤸‍♀️🤸‍♀️🤸‍♀️🤸‍♀️

30 Days! Quick report...Almost all things are good-er

I've tried lots of times and I think each time taught me a little about how to just say goodbye to the cigs.  Like now any craving I get is paired with an image of sooty smoke lining pink lungs, stuffing them up like I sucked a pillow through a straw into my lungs.  But I don't get too many real cravings, I had one that was particularly strong about 2 days ago, but the sooty pillow didn't win, barely even got my attention really.

I didn't gain much weight after the second week, and am now actually down a few pounds due to some moderate exercise and tracking calories. I could stand to lose a lot more though. 

I have drank a couple of times, but even then there was no strong urge to smoke.  Cigarettes are literally disgusting to me now. 

I'm very excited for 3 months clean because that is when a lot of the initial healing and re-balancing of the body really peaks.  So here's to a smoke-free future.

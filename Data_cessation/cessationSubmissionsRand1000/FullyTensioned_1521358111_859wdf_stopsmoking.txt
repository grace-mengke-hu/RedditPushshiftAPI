Such relief on waking!

Had such a vivid dream that I had smoked a cigarette. I was battling with all the old fail demons. Should I just give up? When should I quit again? What kind of a storm am I?

Then I woke up and I was still happily quit ðŸ˜€. It felt so fantastic! Think I'll go for a run. Cos I can!!! Have a great day everybody.

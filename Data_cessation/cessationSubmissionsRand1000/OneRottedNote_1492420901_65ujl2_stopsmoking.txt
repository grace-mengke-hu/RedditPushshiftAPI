Thanks

I'm new to the subreddit, I quit 8 days ago and was feeling fine for most of it (Having tired previously) and this is the point I start to waive. For the 1st time ever I took the intiative and researched support outside of the normal channels. Just by reading and writing this morning has helped alot and I wanted to say thank you to everyone for inputting. On the basis of a thread I saw I downloaded a copy of allen carrs easyway to quit smoking and it is really helping. I was potentially going to relapse on my nicotine addiction today but I feel a lot stronger now. Thanks to the community and the Mods for creaating and maintaining this place.

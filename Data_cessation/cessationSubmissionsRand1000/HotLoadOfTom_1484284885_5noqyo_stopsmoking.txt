Made myself a billionaire by quitting smoking.

Day 10 of my quit and decided to splurge a bit. Bought two guns for $800 total, random gun parts $200, hand strengthening grip on eBay $0.83, and a 10 billion dollar Zimbabwe dollar bill for $0.99. Yay I am a billionaire:) Really cannot start smoking again to pay off my credit card.

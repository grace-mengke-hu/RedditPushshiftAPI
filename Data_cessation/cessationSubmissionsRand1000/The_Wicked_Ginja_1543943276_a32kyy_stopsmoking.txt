An added benefit to quitting

Hi all!!  I can't believe it's been over 6 months since I quit smoking and came to this sub everyday for help.  Everyone here has been kickass and super supportive.  I barely thinking about smoking now. It's such a weird change to go from "when's my next smoke??" to not.

Because I quit, my chances of a recent surgery being successful is almost 100%.  I had my joints fused in my ankle. The Dr asked me if I smoked.  I was able to happily say that I didn't.   He said that was good because smokers have about a 50% chance of a "non-union" which means the joints don't fuse.   In other words,  you just went through an extremely painful surgery for nothing.   

I've never been happier to be a former smoker.   :-)

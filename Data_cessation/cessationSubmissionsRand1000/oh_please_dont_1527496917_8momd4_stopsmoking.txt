I survived Paris!

So i went to Paris on a business trip, helping out on a fair booth. Now if you know France you'll know *everybody* smokes and is so cool about it too. And if you know fairs, you'll know they can be a bit stressful. Not an easy combination for me, buut:

I survived both- with no smoke, no vape, no gum! So proud :-)

Almost had a slip-up :(

So Iâ€™m 14 days into my quit and last night the urges were strong. I even went out to buy a pack before class started thinking that I would smoke one after. I had a cigarette in my lips and a lighter in my hand ready to go. However, something kept prohibiting me from lighting up. I kept thinking of these past 14 days and how difficult they were. I want the momentum to keep going. Today all I want to do is cry because the cravings are still here and strong. I just want to go outside and smoke.

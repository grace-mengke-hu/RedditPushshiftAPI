This last week has been SO BRUTAL!

Just need to vent a little bit. 

I don't know if it's just coincidence/terrible luck that whenever I quit smoking, my life becomes exponentially more stressful, or if it's just in my head... but man, does it suck. I decided to give up drinking for at least the first couple of months of my quit just to make sure it sticks this time. I've had my moments here and there where a smoke just sounds SO GOOD, but resisting hasn't been too difficult.

Until this week. 

Work has been an absolute tidal wave of stress. No sooner had I just sat down at work this morning before I got yelled at for total nonsense I didn't deserve. I'm also taking a pretty difficult night class and have a midterm next week that I'm feeling severely unprepared for, and am behind in the class overall. I have a mountain of miscellaneous BS at home that's giving me crazy anxiety too. All day long today I haven't been able to stop thinking about just grabbing a pack and having a "cheat day." No one'll know!

I know my stress/anxiety management is really the problem, but I'm getting so frustrated. I joined the gym, I picked up embroidery, I'm reading books on a more regular basis again... but it just doesn't seem to be making a dent at the moment. I'm taking the whole week off for spring break (week after next) and going on a road trip/vacation, so I'm hoping that'll help. I guess I just need to bitch a little and let this frustration out. I don't really know what else to do. I'm so damn tired. Smoking sucks, but quitting sucks more. At least that's how it feels right now. 

Regardless, I won't smoke today. But dammit, please someone tell me this gets easier!

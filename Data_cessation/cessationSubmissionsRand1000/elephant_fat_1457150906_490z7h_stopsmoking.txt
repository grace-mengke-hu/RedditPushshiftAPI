My best friend tries to make me relapse every day

Every time I'm with her, at her house, whatever...she pushes me to smoke with her. I honestly very rarely think about or crave cigarettes anymore, and I NEVER have indicated to her that I want one.

I am so beyond angry with her. I think it's envy...if I smoked, she'd feel better about her failure to quit. She's in a tough place, as her father is dying of cancer and I know this brings up some guilt about her continued smoking.

But for real...it's pathetic. I understand where it comes from, but she shouldn't be trying to drag me down. She should, if anything, let me help her quit.

So annoying. If I had a larger circle of friends, I'd probably pull away a bit. Honestly, I might do that regardless. There are plenty of acquaintances I could be closer with if I put in more effort. I bet at least one of them wouldn't push me to a deadly habit :)

But then I feel guilty because she doesn't have many friends and her father is dying. Ahh...I don't know what to do.

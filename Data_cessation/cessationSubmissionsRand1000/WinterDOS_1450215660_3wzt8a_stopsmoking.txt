T-Plus 365 Days

Onto day 366. Not a single cigarette for 1 year. I honestly hardly ever think about it at all, and only when I see other people smoking. Saved a whack of money ($2200), have walked every day 5 kms since I quit 1825 kms in total)  and generally feel great. I Just wanted to pass on to you all that a thoughts become less and less (at least for me) as time progresses. I love that I can sit for long periods of time without having to get up and feed the monster. Good luck all with your quits. Keep trying, eventually one will stick. Cheers!

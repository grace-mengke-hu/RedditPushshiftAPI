Forty days & Forty nights!

...and I can honestly say I cannot imagine ever smoking again. Do I get a jolt of craving still? Sure. But it passes. Also, usually it is just misdirected discontent in my brain. For example, my brain may say "Smoke a cigarette!" to which I will immediately think "I don't smoke." Then I will discover it is lunchtime and I'm actually hungry. Or it's time for afternoon coffee. 

It's like my brain knows my body is missing *something* and it sends the wrong signal to my consciousness. Weird, but I'm getting used to it.

Does this happen to anyone else?

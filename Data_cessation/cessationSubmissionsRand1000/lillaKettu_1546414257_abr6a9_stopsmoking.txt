Day 4 : hard to breathe in the morning

I've been enjoying being smoke free for 4 days and I do believe I can keep this up ! 
But I'm so tired in the mornings when I have a difficult time breathing... ( once it passes I'm fine and I can breathe so well ) but at the same time it's a reminder of why I don't want to smoke anymore. 
I just have been enjoying feeling fresh and I feel like I have smoked the night before when I wake up.. I hope that passes soon.

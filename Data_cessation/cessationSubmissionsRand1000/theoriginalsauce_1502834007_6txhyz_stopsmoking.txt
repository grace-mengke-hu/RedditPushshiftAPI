I quit but husband still smokes

This is making it extremely hard for me to fully commit to quitting. I usually smoke one at 7:30 now after work because [insert excuse here].
How do I fight the cravings when my husband is a chimney?  It's not his fault I am lacking in self control but he's not interested in quitting right now.

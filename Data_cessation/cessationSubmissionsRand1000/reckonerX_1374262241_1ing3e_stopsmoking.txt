Okay. Let's try this shit again. I need to prepare first... any "quit smoking" programs you know of that can help out?

I live in Raleigh NC.

I want to quit smoking. I did it once before by using an ecig, but it was a crappy free giveaway ecig and it gave out on me and then the one night I was drunk, it all went to shit and I started up again. I think the ecig thing actually works for me -- it stops the nic fits and it satisfies my desire to "have something to do" in social settings while my friends are smoking. Ugh, just imagining quitting smoking now is fucking with my head, there are images of dancing cigarette smoke and that burn in my throat... fuck.

Look, I want to do this. I can barely walk a mile without dying because of smoking, and I want to get healthy and start running/exercising, and step one to that is to kick this fucking habit.

1) Does anyone have recommendations for GOOD quality ecigs that won't give out and actually taste good/work? Any of them that actually pack a bit of a punch when you take a drag is good, too.

2) Any tips on places that might help out with the quitting smoking, financially? I'm currently in a situation where I'm living on $20/week, and coming up with the startup capital to quit smoking would be a huge budgetary obstacle.

Thanks, guys. I'm ready to kick this habit's ass.

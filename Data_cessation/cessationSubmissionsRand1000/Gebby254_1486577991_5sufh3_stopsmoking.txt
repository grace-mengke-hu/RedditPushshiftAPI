From someone closing in on a year, to those of you on week one, checking this page several times a day for support...

You're on your way and you'll get here before you know it.

It's going to be tough some days. The tough days fade away, though.  Your pride in what you're doing will not.  And make no mistake, you should be proud.  You are kicking one of the toughest addictions in the world - but it is possible and you CAN do it.  Take it one day at a time, or even one hour at a time if it's needed.  But you can do this.  Keep reminding yourself of that.  

Not one puff, no matter what.  You'll be closing in on a year in no time.

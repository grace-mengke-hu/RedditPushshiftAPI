Thank you for all the help

6 month ago I never thought I would say anything like this, thank you to everybody here, the ones that helped with advice and guidance, those who like myself typed out all the crazy shit that was going on while nicotine was twisting my melon, after 30 odd years of smoking I have not smoked for 200 days, at times it felt  like I was stumbling around lost but this community helped me out of the blues and now it feels great to say I'm a non smoker and once again a big thank you to you all

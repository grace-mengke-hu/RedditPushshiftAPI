Cravings after being quit for some time

I quit smoking almost 8 months ago (next weekend will be the 8 month mark.)  I have found myself having more and more cravings recently.  I have heard that others experience the same.

I once quit before for almost a year, 362 days- and then gave into the cravings and was right back where I started.  I am trying to continually remind myself of that this time around- I cannot have just one.  Ever.  

My husband on the other hand, has been smoking here and there after being quit for a few months as well.  His will power is stronger than mine, and he doesn't end up smoking a pack a day immediately like I do- but I'm still worried about it.  I can taste it on him when we kiss and it makes me wish that I could smoke one too.

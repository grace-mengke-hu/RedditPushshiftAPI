Quitters who smoked for twenty years or more: How long did it take you to get through the detox symptoms?

I'm about two months in and my chest still feels tight, I still get hit hard with fatigue out of nowhere, and I still have a stuffy nose, sinus drainage. Checking in to see if this is normal. Thanks!

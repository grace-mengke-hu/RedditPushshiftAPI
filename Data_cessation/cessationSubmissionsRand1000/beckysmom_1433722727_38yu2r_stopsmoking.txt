OMG - bitch fit, I can't make it stop!!!!

I'm in a horribly rotten bitchy mood and I can't make it stop.  I hate feeling like this - on the line wavering back and forth between screaming angry and crying sadness.  I haven't yet actually screamed or cried but feel like I could at the least bit of provocation.  It hurts.

breaking through

Still going strong, on day 12 now. Was reflecting on my quit so far and I have to say that the process of letting go of smoking is not an easy thing. But as I am proving to myself, an hour a time, it is possible. 

The best thing so far about this is that I have managed to redirect my energy towards all those things I have kept in the back burner - the things I've put off due to lack of energy or focus. 

I'm an artist and for me that has translated into being massively more productive.. breaking through *lots* of creative blockage and self imposed barriers. It honestly feels great.. I wouldn't trade this feeling for anything, let alone f'ing cigarettes.

Here's to all of you fellow quitters out there. Let's surprise ourselves and break this wall down a day at a time.

Tomorrow is my quit date

I have requested a badge for tomorrow. I have been smoking for nearly four years, between a pack and a pack and a half a day. I bought an e-cigarette on Monday and have been smoking rolled cigarettes parallel to the e-cigarette. Now I'm down to my last five and have been smoking the rolled cigarettes less and less frequently. Wish me luck!

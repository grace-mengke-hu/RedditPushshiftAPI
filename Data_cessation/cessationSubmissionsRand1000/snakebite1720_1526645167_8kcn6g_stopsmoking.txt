Yes i relapsed again after 2 weeks. Now going all in starting 20th June

Yeah yeah i know, i relapsed 3rd time in a row. Since March this year i tried three times and every time relapsed post 2 weeks. 

No specific occasions / triggers / moments. I simply gave up to a random small craving knowing i will regret it later. But this time **am going all IN.** By all in i mean completely. 

I have a gym regime to follow for 7 weeks which includes no alcohol for these 7 weeks which starts 20th June. I have set it as my new quit date as well. Post that i will be smoke free.

**What's different this time?** 

Well this time am committed to my health. And i know i have to do it to get required results. Am not sacrificing anything, the only time i sacrifice something is my health when i smoke. 

I got this. I can do it. We can do it. We will do it. !!! 

Love &amp; Wishes to everyone trying out there. Let's kill it.

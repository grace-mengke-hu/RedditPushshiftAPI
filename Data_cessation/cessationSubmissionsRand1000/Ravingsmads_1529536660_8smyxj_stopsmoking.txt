Just finished 48 hours without a single puff or nicotine of any kind. Here is how it's been.

So, a pack a day smoker for 5 or so years. 22 years old. 48 hours smoke free.

It's surprisingly easier than I expected so far. Some anger bursts, some brain fog causing me to act silly/stupid at times. But generally I feel myself.

Whenever I crave a cigarette I either eat something (I'm underweight so weight gain is no issue). Or I smell a small pot I filled with some ashtrays and butts which smells awful.

I sometimes forget that I quit and reach for my pack which doesn't exist. But generally I'm not at all miserable and I feel amazing.

Let's hope the third day isn't much worse.

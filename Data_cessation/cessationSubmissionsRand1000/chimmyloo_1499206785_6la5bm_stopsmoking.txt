I've been putting this off for too long

I kept waiting to get severely sick with bronchitis or the flu, figured it'd make quitting a lot easier. But for whatever reason my health has been in tact. So I'm about to read Alan Carr's "The Easy Way". I read it once a long time ago and it almost worked. But this time I'm determined to make it stick, and it helps knowing I can still smoke while reading it.

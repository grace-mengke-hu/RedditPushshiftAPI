Day 7. Help

I'm really proud of myself to be approaching a week without cigarettes, but I'm really struggling. My cravings are becoming less frequent but they have become much more intense when they strike.

I have experienced many positive things since I've quit such as saving money, my sense of smell and taste has returned and my clothes don't stink anymore. However, my mood has plummeted and I experience long spells of depression. Any advice?

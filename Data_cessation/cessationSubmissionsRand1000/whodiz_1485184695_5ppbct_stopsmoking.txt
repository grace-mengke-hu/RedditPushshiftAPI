Close to 9 days in and..

The first few days were bearable, didn't really have strong cravings and could get by my days easily.

But recently I have been through a couple of stressful situations. They became more tempting and tempting with each craving, I almost broke but thankfully, I managed to convinced myself that smoking is not going to solve anything and eventually add to the stress. 

Also noticed I procrastinated on school work a lot recently because I used to smoke often when I'm doing them at home. Didn't want to trigger myself then. But I really had to get it done so I planned to do them in small durations with many breaks so I won't have a strong urge to smoke. Thankfully it worked!! 

I also started writing benefits I get as day goes by which motivates me every time I see it! 

So far so good, might see cracks along the way if I don't watch myself the next few days. 

Thank you for taking the time to read!

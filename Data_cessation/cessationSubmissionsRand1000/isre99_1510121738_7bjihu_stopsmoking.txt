What kind of damage have I done to myself? Will quitting now help me live a longer life?

Ive been smoking on and off since I was 15 years old.  I’m currently 18 and still smoke about 4 a day or less. I’ve tried to quit so many times but depression and certain trigger factors will make me spark up again. I feel like I’m now ready to quit again for real. I just want to know, what kind of (potentially permanent) damage have I done to my body already and will quitting help drive me away from potential smoking related diseases? Thanks

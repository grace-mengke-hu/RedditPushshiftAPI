day 4 and feeling amazing!!

I cannot believe how good I feel today and how pissed off I am that I allowed myself to be brainwashed for so long about how hard stopping smoking was going to be. I have smoked since I was 15 and am now in my mid 50s so basically, this is my first time as an adult non smoker! Some random thoughts; I have been doing laundry for 2 days straight now, blankets, sheets, clothes, coats, they really stink! I am so sorry to all the people in my life that had to put up with my awful smell! Smoking took up a lot of time. Not just the actual smoking but the planning, worrying if you had enough, hoping there was somewhere you could smoke wherever you went, it just goes on and on! Sorry for length but just am so happy to be where I am. Thank you so much to all  here for the support and inspiration! Today is a good day not to smoke

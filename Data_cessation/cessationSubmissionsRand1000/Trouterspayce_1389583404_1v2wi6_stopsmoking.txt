Today instead of smoking and sitting around gaming -

Today while my girlfriend was out of town I hung the curtains my she's has been bugging me to hang, I fixed up her bike (replaced the freewheel), I rode my own bike 35 miles, and cleaned up house. I feel awesome for being productive / not smoking, and she's gonna be stoked when she gets home!  

The things I can do when I'm not baked all the time and stopping for a cig every 30 minutes! 

Hope everyone had a good weekend, and is staying strong!

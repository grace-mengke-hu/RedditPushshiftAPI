Over a year still detoxing

It’s been a wild ride of detoxification!  I have quit for over a year! I have been starting to detox each organ one by one and I swear there are still chemicals from tobacco coming out of my cells.  I am finally loosing weight and getting healthy again.   I play basketball every week and can actually run.  My lymph system has come back to normal.  I can taste and smell the sweet aromas of life.    I did a liver cleanse and the smell omg.  It smelled like cigars and old man death like pure black tar sludge.  Sometimes I can still taste tobacco when I am burning fat storage.  When I smell a cig it smells so bad and I can’t believe I used to smoke.  Now with each cleanse I feel a little brighter inside.  Just thought I would update y’all. Thanks for being there when I needed someone to bitch to...

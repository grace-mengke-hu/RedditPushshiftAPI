A postponed resolution of sorts 

I had resolved to quit smoking on New Years. I went a day and then had an extremely frustrating day due to outside factors yesterday and went and bought a pack of my crutches. I felt guilty after, knowing I had let myself down. Then, seeing the uplifting posts on /r/stopsmoking, part of me felt even worse. I was very hard on myself for falling so early. 

Then that guilt turned into motivation. This sub, comprised of people I don't know, has given me an uplifted drive to be done for good. 

Thank you all for posting your progress and encouraging others. I just smoked my last cigarette out of that pack. Tomorrow, I awake as a nonsmoker and I'm excited to start my journey to better health. 

Thank you all for helping me refocus on my determination to quit.

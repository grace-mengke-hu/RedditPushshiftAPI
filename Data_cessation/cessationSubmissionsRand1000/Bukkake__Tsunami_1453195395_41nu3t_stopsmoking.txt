Ways in which my addiction-fueled brain is trying to get me to start smoking again

Okay, so I'm aware that addiction likes to talk a lot, especially when it stops getting fueled. But man, the subtlety. I can list so many reasons why I'm gonna fail this attempt, and to me they kinda look reasonable on the surface. I really need to keep telling myself that this is not my rational mind talking to me. This is the addiction talking and what it has in store for me if I give in is the opposite of beneficial for me. I'm gonna give myself some accountability by listing its deceptions:

* 20 days in, it's still not easy "all day, every day". So what? If I smoke, the whole process starts again from the top. Going in, I absolutely knew it wasn't gonna be easy.

* I made a mistake. See, I smoke weed. As a recovering alcoholic, weed is the only way for me to get an occasional buzz without ruining my life. I've tried several ways to consume it over the last week. I am going to buy a high end vaporizer in the long run, hoping it'll solve that problem for good, but right now it's not worth 200â‚¬ to me. So I smoke joints with pure weed in them, no tobacco. It works, but it's gross. But I fear it may be messing with the part of my brain responsible for my cigarette addiction. I feel like I'm getting more cravings since I got some weed a week ago. On the other hand, while I'm high, I don't crave at all. I've never really smoked cigarettes while high. Probably shouldn't do it every day though :P

* I have this constant feeling that this is still not a real attempt, because I used a minor flu to jump-start the first few days (illness = fewer cravings), instead of deciding on the start date myself. Translation: "because reasons". This really is such bullshit. Instead of building on the 20 days I have under my belt, my addiction-fueled brain is trying to tell me to start again just so I can quit again. It doesn't make any sense at all, but it feels "kinda right" at times.

* I quit alcohol, which was legitimately ruining my life. Let's be honest for a moment: Smoking doesn't ruin your life the same way alcohol does. Yes, it'll kill you one day, but I've never actually been able to quit an addiction because of its health implications. I've always had other reasons. Telling myself that smoking will probably kill me one day doesn't really scare me. So of course right now my addiction-fueled brain is telling me to smoke because it wasn't ruining my life like alcohol was. My life is actually pretty great right now. Smoking wouldn't improve it at all though. I have to keep telling myself that.

* I'm slowly undoing all my weight loss progress from 2015 right now. Oh well, it wasn't much anyway, but it does hurt a bit. I know I will get back on track in the long run (still wanna reach my goal weight in 2016), but while I quit smoking, I really gotta let it go and not be too hard on myself. Smoking to lose weight is a stupid idea. Meth would be more effective ;)

Okay, that was another unintended wall of text, but it's been building up for a while. Cheers if you made it this far.

Have a great day folks. Don't smoke today. I won't.

Relapse Guilt &amp; Regret

    So I had sinus surgery about a month or so ago and was strongly advised to quit beforehand.  I mustered up the courage, powered through the cravings, and just did it.  I made it through the recovery and was finally feeling healthy and proud of myself for staying smoke-free.  Made it about a month and I was stupid and naïve and truly thought I was out of the woods and my smoking days were behind me.   I really thought I was strong enough and could have that “just one” occasional social cigarette but boy was I wrong.

Here I am about a week later in compete relapse, feeling awful about myself and filled with so much regret and guilt for falling right back into the nicotine trap.   Since that “one cigarette”, I’ve bought a pack everyday, smoke a few, then I always end up destroying and throwing the rest away because I feel so bad about what I’m doing.  Of course I always end up buying another pack the next day and do the exact same thing; it is a complete lack of self-control and a total waste of money.   I am now continually feeding into cravings because I am absolutely terrified of the withdrawal.   I was successful before because I had that “buffer” of sinus surgery that essentially forced me to not smoke, and now that I don’t have that, I don’t have much hope that I can be successful in quitting again.  I’m scared and am feeling like a total failure.   I know I want to quit but I just don’t feel motivated or ready anymore, just been feeling so badly that all my progress has now gone down the drain.  No real point to this post, just wanted to get my feelings out, thanks for listening.

My first weekend into quitting.

I went to the bar on Friday, and was outside with all of my smoking friends. It was my close friend's birthday.

I gave him my remaining cigarettes for his birthday. I don't really feel great about it, but he has no ambition for quitting at all so whatever, he gets some free cigarettes. 

I drank plenty of booze and didn't smoke a single cigarette! when I first started drinking all I could think about were cigarettes, but that was before I was at the bar. Once I walked to the bar, and saw everyone smoking and smelled all of their breath and hands it was just a huge turn off.. i didn't have another craving the rest of the night!

These drunken douchebags came in and called me a faggot too, which was weird and unexpected and completely rude.. and even after all of that, I still did not have a cigarette!

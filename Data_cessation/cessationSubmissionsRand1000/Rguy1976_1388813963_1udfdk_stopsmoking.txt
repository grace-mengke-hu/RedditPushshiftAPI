I smoked my last cigarette. I quit.

That's it.  I'm done smoking. I'm deleting my badge. I'm not going to be smoking again, so there's no point in keeping track in case of "relapse".  No sense counting the days until the end of my life.  I've got nothing to count.  As for my old nemesis...  I threw them out this morning and had about 2 hours where I "kinda" wanted one.  I have now adopted a thought:



I refuse to believe that I need a cigarette!  Much like I refuse to believe that masturbation will make a genie come out of my dick.



I'll stick around and try to encourage some.  But I'm done.  Thanks for all the support in the week I've been here!

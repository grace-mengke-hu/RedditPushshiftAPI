5 days, but going to a show tonight

I haven't had a cigarette since last Sunday afternoon when I crushed out  after half of one. I'm going out to a show tonight. I'll probably have a couple beers and I'll be hanging out with smokers. I'll probably be best if I just stay indoors. I'm doing my best to not cave.

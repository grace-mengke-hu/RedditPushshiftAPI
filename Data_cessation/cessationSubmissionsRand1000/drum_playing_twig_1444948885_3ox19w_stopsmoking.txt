Stopping smoking is impossible

At least that's what I used to think.

I smoked, I quit. I smoked, I quit. Rince and repeat. I always came back after a day or week. It was fucking impossible to quit for good.

But something happened during my 4th or 5th try. I was tired of being a slave, wasting so much money, hating visiting parents (never smoked infront of them, counting the seconds until it was appropriate to leave), losing my sense of smell, coughing up my lunghs on a regular basis, terrible health and body.

It **is** posible to quit for good. I don't even think about smoking anymore, not even in a nostalgic way. I don't remember joy during those hot summer evenings on my balcony with a cold beer and a smoke. I pity myself back then, that I was so fooled by thinking those shit sticks was giving me pleasure when in actuality they were just making me feel like non smokers feel constantly.

This rant has no point. I'm just so happy and free. I wish you all the same. This sub rocks!

1000 HOURS and not happy...

I'm proud but not happy. 

Since I've quit, there's been a noticeable change in my personality. Of course the first week I was a complete mess but that leveled off. But since then, I've noticed that I'm just not the person I used to be. I'm not as jovial, not as friendly, not as quick with a laugh or a joke, I'm more quick to critique and just overall a more rigid, dare i say edgy person. 

My wife has commented on it and all I can do is agree with her. I could attribute it to 20 years of being used to getting dopamine injections every half hour. I could also attribute it to not having a security blanket. But I don't know. 

I feel that I've lost my favorite part of myself...my easy going nature. I don't feel the desire to smoke anymore which is great. But I do have the desire to find that part of me again. 

1000 hours down. Proud, yes.

Side effects ?

I've been smoke free for 9 days. I'm using the patch, and aside from the first day, all is going well. I used to smoke about half a pack a day, so I started out with the 21mg patch. Of course, I'm slightly allergic to the patch adhesive, but I'm not too concerned about that. However, about 15 minutes after putting the patch on, I get a little bit jittery and light headed. Is 21mg too much for me? Is it just the rush of nicotine?  It does go away after about 30 minutes.

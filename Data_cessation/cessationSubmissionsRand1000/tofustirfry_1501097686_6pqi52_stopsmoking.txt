Day 15: 1 mile, tricep/trap/ab lift, no smokes, no drinks

Half a month and going strong. Continually trying to build on this awakening and the latest is adding in a nice run! Rolled out of bed and before I did anything else just went running. Made a 10:15/mile and now back home ready to jump in the shower before work. Tonight, leg day.

Not drinking and smoking seem to be made easier when I feel major improvements daily on my body from exercise. I know in the past is lift or run for 5-7 days until one day is justify not working out because of party or fun. The next day would resume the party and before I knew it, an entire month would pass before I'd lift or run again. Not this time:-)

Today I will run with you, I will lift with you but I will not smoke or drink with you!:-). Have a great day!

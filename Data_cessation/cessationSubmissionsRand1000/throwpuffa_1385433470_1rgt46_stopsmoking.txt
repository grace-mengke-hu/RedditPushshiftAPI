Accountability

Am about to go run an errand and am feeling the most vulnerable I have in the last ten days.  I think it's because I'm hungry and I would eat before leaving, but I have no food (grocery store is my errand).  

I'm posting because I want that accountability, even if no one reads this, to be able to come back and post "I did it."  

So, see y'all in an hour or so.  I hope...

2 weeks today!

I am really surprised, actually. I didn't think I was actually going to quit but I just kind of did...I wanted to start Wellbutrin for some situational depression and I read that it helps with smoking cessation. I also read I wasn't supposed to drink while taking Wellbutrin so on March 25th I quit drinking and set April 1st as my quit date with no real motivation. At 12:20a on April 1st I put out my last cigarette and haven't looked back. It feels amazing to be a non-smoker!

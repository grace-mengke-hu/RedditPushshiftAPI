Goal reached! I just feel like gloating :)

I quit nearly a month ago for about 1000 good reasons, but the short term reason was that I am going on a month long vacation abroad with my mother and younger cousin (neither of whom know I smoked).

I wanted to be able to have a fun trip without sneaking around smoking and being out of breath on the long treks.  I also wanted to be "quit enough" to not feel emotional and fuzzy from quitting. 

Well.... I leave next week and I've never felt better.  I feel like all my pre-trip anxiety is gone now that I don't have to "suffer" through 10 hour plane rides and family time.  Yee to the haw!

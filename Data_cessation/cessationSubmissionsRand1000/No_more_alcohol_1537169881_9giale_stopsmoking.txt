17 days no cigarette

this is still happening! I remember a few weeks ago just in total pain, I was contemplating on stopping very soon, but I was in a massive sink hole. The next day I'd cave in and roll a smoke , and again and again and so on until I woke up sick 17 days ago with a chest infection , thanks to that I haven't had one since. IM NEVER GOING BACK it takes so much energy to get through those first weeks!! I did it! now its time to heal my lungs and brain from nicotine poison.

Waking up...??

I smoked for 10+ years. I'm only 3 days in, but my mindset is totally different this time, mostly due to this sub. 


I need to point out that its been hard for me to wake up my entire adult life. I've lost countless jobs due to my inability to wake to an alarm. 

This morning, only my 3rd day in, I woke after 6 hours sleep feeling energized, well rested and ready to start the day. Was this a fluke? Or can I expect more of the same?

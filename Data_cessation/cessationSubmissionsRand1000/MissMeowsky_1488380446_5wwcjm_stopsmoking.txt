365 days today... now what...

...well, now I continue to live my life, healthier than before, happier than before...


If you decided to quit today, just do it... It's totally worth it... It's worth going through the cravings and feeling miserable for a while, because once you get through it, you'll realize just how good life is without cigarettes, without that foul smell, without tar and nicotine and a hundred more chemicals infesting your lungs.


Today will be a crappy work day with crazy clients... today I will still be scared that I'm rapidly approaching my 40s... but today will be a day without a cigarette, and that makes today a good day!

9 months without smoking

I remember the days i was really trying to quit, but just couldn't do it.

I used to go on this subreddit, watched alot videos on how to quit smoking, read a book about it etc... But i never could get passed 2-3 weeks without smoking (most attempts would fail after only 2-3 days).

Then i gave up. I just didn't try anymore. I kept smoking. 

And it was a relief to just let go of the constant fight in my head. 
I just smoked whenever i wanted to. So in the end i would smoke 1-2 packages a day (which was quite alot for me).

And at the point i didn't judge my smoking habits anymore, 
it made "click".

It's really hard to explain what this "click" means, but if i should i would put it like that: 

*i realized that there is no good reason to quit smoking, but there also is no good reason to keep smoking.*

All the fuzz in my head stopped and i just quit from one day to another.

It wasn't hard at all.

Since then i never was tempted at all to start smoking again. I didn't need any apps, books, meditations and what not to stay quit.

I just noticed that it has been over 9 months now and i just wanted to share this here, because i used to hang out in this subreddit alot :)

tl;dr 

My advice: Stop trying

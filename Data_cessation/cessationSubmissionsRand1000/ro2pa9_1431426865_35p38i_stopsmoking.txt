4 digits. Woooo. And a little thank you.

I made it to 1000!!! Woooo.

It is a fight that gets easier the longer you fight it, but you can never fully stop and I will never stop. I am not saying I won't occasionally stop by to lurk around, but I am unsubscribing, because it sometimes pulls me into thinking about that nasty stuff and I don't want that. But before I leave I want to thank you all very much for support and explanations for different approaches to problems that I faced.

Good luck to you all, even if that is not all you will need.

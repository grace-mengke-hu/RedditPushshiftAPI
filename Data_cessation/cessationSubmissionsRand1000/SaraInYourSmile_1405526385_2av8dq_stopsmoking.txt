First drink since I quit, and I didn't smoke!

I also didn't enjoy the beer at all.  It tasted so strange (maybe because I'm getting my taste buds back?).  I was even able to sit on the patio with the smokers, and felt no desire to have one.  I just sat there and smoked my eCig, and was perfectly happy.

So glad to know if I want to go out I can, and not be completely overwhelmed by the desire to smoke! It gives me hope that my life is going to be normal again, without a cloud of smoke surrounding it!

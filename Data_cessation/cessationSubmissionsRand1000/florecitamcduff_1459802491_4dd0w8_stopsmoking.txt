Had the last of a pack at lunch, here goes nothing.

I'm 25 and I've been smoking for ~10 years. My career and romantic life are going in a direction that just won't tolerate cigarettes. I want to be successful in work and at home, and those are my motivations to quit. I've got some NRT lozenges, some tea tree toothpicks, and a giant smoothie to try this out. Wish me luck! 
BTW Any specific tips for menthol smokers? I'm concerned that I might have a psychological addiction to the menthol in addition to the nicotine...

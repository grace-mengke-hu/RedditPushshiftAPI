A little bit of extra humor and sexual healing is totally helping me survive the first couple of days of my nnnnteenth go at quitting. Get those good endorphins rolling and re-pattern your brain circuits.

My SO and I are quitting for the gazillionth time after decades of smoking.  We're both using NRT bc we've found that we're both complete assholes without some kinda step down in nicotine.  I've been watching comedy standup shows and getting busy with the SO or alone with myself at an intentionally increased frequency.  It's been a game changer.

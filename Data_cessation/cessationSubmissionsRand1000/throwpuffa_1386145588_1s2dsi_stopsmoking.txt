A rough few days ahead...

My SO's 25 year old cousin died on Thanksgiving night, and we are traveling tomorrow for the funeral.  It will be five days of family and sadness.  A terrible, tragic, fucked up thing.  

We're taking two cars to make it so one less car will need to be rented by folks flying in (we're some of the only family on this coast), so I will be driving 3+ hours by myself each way, tomorrow and this weekend.  

1.)  First time driving more than twenty minutes at a time without cigarettes (driving is one of my big triggers).  2.)  Tragic occasion.  3.)  Smokers will definitely be all around.

I'm not *really* worried about smoking.  I'm very happy with where I am 18 days in and I really don't want to screw this up.  My mother-in-law will be there and she and my SO are pretty good deterrents.  I'm also mindful of the fact that I'm still alive, despite years and years of smoking, when this amazing, talented, kind, funny 25 year old kid is not. 

But.  There's always that chance that I'll fold, especially if I drink, which I haven't since my last cig.  I am a nicotine addict after all.  So I'm writing this, both to prepare myself and hold myself accountable.  I really don't want to have to come here and tell you guys that I caved, and have to reset my badge.  (I love that (2) and seeing my daily number go up each day.  I can't wait for the (3) and beyond.)

Please send good, strong thoughts my way these next few days - thank you!

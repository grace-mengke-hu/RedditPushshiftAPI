5 days, 17 hours and 13 minutes since my last smoke

Hey, guys! There was nowhere else I could turn so I had to post here. I've been a two-packs a day (A pack here has 10 cigarettes) smoker for over 12 years and last week I had my last smoke. I reached an all time low when I went for a trek to one of my favorite places last week and was extremely exhausted after reaching home. Ive done this before but I was NEVER this tired. I made up my mind. Need to quit smoking. Stop coughing like a mad man. It's been five days now. I feel giddy and light headed at times. It's like I'm looking at the world with a new perspective altogether. Anyway, just wanted to tell others like me that it isn't as difficult as it seems. I always used to think that I could quit whenever I wanted. Sometimes I'd even convince myself that it's my damn life and I don't need to quit anything. If you are one of those, trust me, you're hooked. Thoughts are a little haywire right now but spirits are high. Cheers, guys! :)

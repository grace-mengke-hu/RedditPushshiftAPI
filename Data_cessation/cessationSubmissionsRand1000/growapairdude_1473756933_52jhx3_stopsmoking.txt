Scared of the number 13, but still going to quit today

Have some issues with OCD, depression, stopped smoking weed on 9/11(wanted to stop smoking cigs on that date too, wanting to be badass, but coulnd't make it past the day... :( ) and now quitting today on 9/13. Oh well. Maybe if I make it stick and commit myself to stop today, I'll also beat my OCD and fear about 13. Wish me luck.

Or I could wait until midnight and extinquish my cig 5 minutes into the 14th of september, but then I'm already giving in to my OCD, aren't I?

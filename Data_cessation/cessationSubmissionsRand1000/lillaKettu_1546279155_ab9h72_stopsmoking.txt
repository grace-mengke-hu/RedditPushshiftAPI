Day 2 : rant

I've been smoke free for 2 days and 9 hours.
I would say it is going great other than that I'm having a bad headache and all the fireworks aren't helping. I decided to not drink today ( I usually drink 1 or 2 here and there so it's not a big deal ) so I wouldn't be around people that smoke. Well the problem right now is that I'm really down due to my family not supporting me ( mainly because almost all of them smokes and drinks ) and I don't feel like making a big deal of today and they just won't leave me alone and keeps asking me to smoke with them. I really don't want to so I have no problem saying no but I really wanted to be in a good mood today and start 2019 fresh ! So I'm feeling a bit left out , maybe a bit lonely too. But whatever happens today I won't smoke. I don't want to start over again tomorrow . I want to succeed ! Sorry for ranting,  how are you feeling today?

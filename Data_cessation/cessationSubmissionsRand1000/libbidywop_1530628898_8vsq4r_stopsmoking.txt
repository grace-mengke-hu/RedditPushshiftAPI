10 hours 38 minutes. Trying Tabex

So far so good. I'm at work so I'm busy, no hardcore cravings yet. I'm a pack a day smoker. I've quit what feels like 50-60 times over the last 6 years. I really don't want to do it anymore. But in the past I had such a bad obsession even after a few months that I picked back up again. I can't see the future and I shouldn't stay in the past. I'm just not gonna smoke for today. Wish me luck guys

Patches Too Strong ?

This is my 5th attempt this year hate smoking with full stop 

First attempt went 3.5 months using patches after 3 months the patches had gone. Started again for 3 weeks 

Attempt 2 1 week started again 

Attempt 3 3 weeks Started again 

Attempt 4 1 week Started again 

Each time started with 21 mg patch 

Now into my third week feeling dizzy this morning so changed to 14 mg and feel ok now 

Anyone experienced this ?

Upcoming Stag-do

I could do with hearing about others who have made it through stag dos and other bingey weekends without smoking,

I'm currently 5 weeks into my most recent quit attempt. 11 years, 20 a day.  Probably my 4th serious attempt. 2nd longest.

&amp;#x200B;

I love a good binge.  Excessive drinking, a bit of cocaine, a bit of weed....

At the end of September I go away on a stag do with some similar minded chaps and I'm nervous about my ability to keep smoke free.   I have managed nights with drugs and without smoking, but 3 nights away, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to make it.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I setting my self up for a fall?  Has anyone else managed a similar situation and remained free of nicotine?  Any stories or input would be welcome!

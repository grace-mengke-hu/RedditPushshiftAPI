Day 14: 202 cigarettes not smoked, 168 beers not consumed, $358 saved

Well here we are at two weeks sober of alcohol and nicotine! Its been a bit of a bumpy ride but overall - my head has been in the right place and focused.Still have very strong cravings at very random moments but those are very few these days.

It was my girlfriends day off yesterday. Made her breakfast, she enjoyed a vodka oj and cig around 1pm and then we went out for dinner where sake was had and then darts and dessert with after dinner drinks and cigs. It was the first time I've really put myself in those situations I used to consume and smoke a lot - and I fucking loved it. Clear headed to enjoy the moment, genuinely laugh at her jokes, be present enough to tell my own, happy to be sober to drive her safely home.  Got home around 11pm and did a two hour workout until 1am then hung out watching a show with her. The more the night went on, the more I enjoyed it and the less afraid I was of failing.  

One thing I did realize is that yes, while someone is smoking - it smells so fucking good - but holy hell does it smell like shit after they are done and it sticks to their body, clothes and breath. Like shit acid in your nostrils. insane I never realized that before.

Long winded post - two weeks, doing well and learning to live a full life without these addictions.

I will not smoke or drink with you today!

Quitting

Day-8 
The main trigger for me are the negative people who unstablize my mental state by saying unwanted things which my mind will not be able to process hence i try to maintain distance instead of entertaining them and getting distressed.
Comment if someone is also dealing with such situations.
Stay strong! Stay smoke free!

Reset badge after 42 days

42 days is a record.  But I know why I smoked.  In April moved to a new neighborhood and the patios are much different than my old neighborhood.  No one smokes here.  Friday night found myself at a frequently visited place in the old neighborhood with an old friend from out of state and sure enough 2 or 3 cigarettes were smoked.  Lesson here, stay away from old hang out areas where smoking was frequent for you.

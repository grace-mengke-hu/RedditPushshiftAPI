16 years smoker quitting today, started when i was 9!

Hello fellow ambitious redditors, i have started smoking in the 4th grade, i was 9 at the time, by the 5th grade i was smoking a pack/day. Now I am 25, and this is the first time i try to quit, after realizing I've been smoking for about 2/3 of my life. I feel so ashamed and embarrassed, but since i just found this sub I taught why not share it with you guys? Any piece of advice/ideas/cheers up are much appreciated!

I quit on Sunday Morning

Hey all,

I just wanted to drop a line and introduce myself! I've been lurking for quite a while. 

Prior to Sunday, I had been smoking on and off for about 12 years, and had tried to quit in the past, both cold turkey and using patches/gum. The past year I smoked quite heavily, but was ready to leave the habit behind, so I started reducing the number of smokes I had per day.

Sunday morning I had my last cigarette, and so far, so good! The cravings are starting to ease up a bit now. The biggest frustrations/side effects I'm experiencing are a constant runny nose (that lovely clear stuff) and painful stomach cramps/the runs. I had insomnia for the first two nights, but that seems to have settled down now. 

In the past, I have not had any physical symptoms apart from cravings. I am wondering how long I should expect the GI stuff to go on? I should also add that I am celiac (and no, I'm not eating gluten - I've triple checked everything).

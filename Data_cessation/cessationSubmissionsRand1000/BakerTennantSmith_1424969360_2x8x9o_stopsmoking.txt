Still here and smoke free. :) Who would've thunk it?

It's 19 days since my last slip. It's 47 days overall since I made the choice. I feel incredible. I rarely think of smoking. If I do, it's fleeting but rarely full on cravings. 

Since then, I have given up alcohol, diet soda and now really focus on eating healthy and working out. I'm not gaining weight and have lost the weight I initially gained.

My self esteem is through the roof with this. I quit smoking. Me? I never thought I would. I assumed I would be absolutely miserable. I thought it would be the hardest thing I have ever done. 

True and false.

There were days that were brutal. But I made it. 

I'm a non-smoker. I don't feel the need to have suckers and gums all of the time. I gave up smoking and suddenly realized that I have so much more free time in my day. 

This sub is awesome. Allen Carr's book is incredible. Learning just how strong I am is priceless.

Almost 2 months! Who would've thunk it?

Yay I have a badge. Thank you to all

Even this far I still struggle some days. Most says I'm good and forget I was even a smoker. But on high tension high stress days just make me wanna light up.  
I'm so glad to be a part of this community, its such a great support group to turn to when times are tough. A big thank you to everyone.

7 Months Today!

I'm at 7 months today and it feels incredible.  The longest I have gone previously was 6 months before caving.  I still have the occassional what if moment... Usually when I am having a cocktail or extremely stressed out.   Luckily, I've been through almost anything a person could go through in the past 7 months so I now know that I truly can make it through anything and not pick them back up.  
I am so beyond proud of myself and anyone else on this journey to a healthier lifestyle.  

To everyone just quitting be persistant and do not cave into those cravings, they will go away and they will get easier.  You will be so happy with yourself and with live once you can say you are no longer a prisoner to nicotine!

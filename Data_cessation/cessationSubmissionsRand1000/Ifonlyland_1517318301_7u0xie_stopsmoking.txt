Ex smokers with depression

I quit 10 days ago. I have underlying unmedicated depression.

Im wondering if any ex smokers experienced significant improvement in their mood after quitting long term. If so, when did you notice the benefits to your mood? 

I know research says quitting helps but I would really like to hear from first hand experience.

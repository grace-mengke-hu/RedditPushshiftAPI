1300

Feeling grateful today. After suffering a 40 year addiction, today I celebrate 1300 days totally cigarette and nicotine free. Thanks to Mr. Allen Carr and his amazing book of truth. Feels great to finally be free from the slavery of my nicotine addiction. Anybody can quit. Hang in there everyone.

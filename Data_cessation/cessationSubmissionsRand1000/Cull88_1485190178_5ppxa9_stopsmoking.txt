Well, here we go again...

I'm here again, after a successful 5 month quit last year, I made the decision to be a smoker again. I could lie and say "oh, it was this, it was that" but I know it's bullshit, I made the choice to have that 1 single cig I thought I could get away with. Fast forward 9 months and i'm still smoking. I'm done now, just had my last one.

This subbreddit helped me a lot the first time. I've lurked here pretty much the whole time I started again. It's just been so difficult, like all motivation and will power has vanished. I will do this.

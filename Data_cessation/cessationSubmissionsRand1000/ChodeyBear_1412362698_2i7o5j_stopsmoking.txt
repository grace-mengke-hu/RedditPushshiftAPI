I've faced a number of triggers over the last couple of days :(

I've had a bit of a rough time the last couple of days, tbh. 

Yesterday I had a bit of a situation at work where I felt left out, sounds so very high school doesn't it. But my brain works in crazy ways when things like that happen and I feel rejected... Previous quit attempts have been ruined in times like these.

Then I had the first day of an evening course I've started - ive been to the same place before and last time I was there I was depressed and puffing away after my last failed quit. The course is counselling skills and is very much about examining yourself so that has potential to get rough.

Then this morning my boyfriend was snappy with me and ruined my makeup so I had to spend 10 mins in the car outside work redoing my face.

I've had a pretty sucky day at work too.

I'm alright though. I haven't smoked. But I'm in scary territory at the moment as it's times like this I get self-destructive.

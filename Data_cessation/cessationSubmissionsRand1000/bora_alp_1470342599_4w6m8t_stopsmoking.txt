In need of urgent help. My pet died.

Hello, my cat died I've been crying in front of the vet clinic for the last 5 hours.

I don't have any relatives so he meant the world to me. Now that I survived the initial shock I want to smoke.

I know smoking won't bring him back but I feel like a part of me died with him. How will I survive tonight without smoking? Thanks.

Edit: THANK YOU for all the support, you guys really made me feel like I wasn't all alone last night. Fortunately, I was able to control myself and I didn't smoke. I still feel like crap today but I don't feel like smoking at all. I can't express how grateful I am for your support, it brings tears to my eyes. I love this community. Stay strong everyone!

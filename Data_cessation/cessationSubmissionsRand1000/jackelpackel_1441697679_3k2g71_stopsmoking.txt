Finally decided to stop

I've been smoking since I was 14 years old. Lately, I've been smoking 2-3 packs a day. The major reason I started smoking so much was due to drugs and partying on the weekend every week for the past 4 years. It got to the point 3 days ago that I would smoke 5 cigs in like 20 minutes and still not be satisfied.

I said fuck it and threw on a cigarette patch and been smoker-free for 3 days (2Â½ if you wanna be technical).

The only problem is I'm constantly hungry, I have crazy arse dreams, can't sleep when I want to, if I do sleep, it's not for long. My cravings are insane. I mean the patch is helping, but I have the urges so bad. :'(

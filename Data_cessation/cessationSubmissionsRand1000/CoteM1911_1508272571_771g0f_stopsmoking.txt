Two months and I could give a shit less about em...

Two months and I havn't given cigarettes a second thought in over a month. It's SO easy this time it almost feels criminal. There is definitely something in being 100% mentally ready to kick this addiction. I attempted to quit many times over the years and wanted to climb the fucking walls and kill people. I vaped for a few years too, started smoking again. I hadn't been without nicotine since I was 15 years old. 

And let me make this clear I LOVE smoking. It will always have a place near and dear in my heart. I think it's sexy and stress relieving and so many other things BUT I smoked for 15 years... I had my fun and I don't regret it but it's time to hang it up and see what life has to offer without that ball and chain.

I didn't want to be a smoker at 30 that was my cut off. I was going to wait until then, (I'm 29 now and I'll be 30 in March) but something clicked 2 months ago and I'm honestly just over it. People smoke around me, I could give a shit. The smell doesn't bother me, and I don't find pleasure in it either. It is what it is.

I've gotten pissed off about things, cried, screamed, had stress, drank and got shitfaced and never once thought about lighting up. After the storms passed I thought back like 'Holy shit, did I really not crave a cigarette that whole time?'. 

I SO wish I could just bottle up this feeling and hand it out to every struggling. It's the best feeling. Anyways to those struggling, you had your fun with smoking. Check that experience off the list and move on to something else. You're not missing out on anything by quitting that's for sure. Hang in there!

EDIT- before you all jump down my throat about maybe getting to confident or 'stay aware' etc. I got it... I'm aware. But I'm also thankful it's not consuming my thoughts 24-7 like it used to. I know where I came from and I know I don't want to go back. Ever.

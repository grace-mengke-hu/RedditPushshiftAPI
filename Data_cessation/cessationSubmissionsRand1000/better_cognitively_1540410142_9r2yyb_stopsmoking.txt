It's been exactly 365 Days that I have been trying to quit smoking and finally today I'm 32 Days Nicotine free. I have reached a point where my brain has stopped associating cigarettes to stress. But I must admit I still have anxiety issues. I don't know why I'm still getting anxious time to time.

How do I get rid of anxiety? How long does it take to completely get rid of all the mental and emotional problems related to quitting smoking?

This would be the 5th day without cigs

Day five,

Nice on i would say. Have not smoked for quite a bit. Sure i eat more. But i like to eat and it tastes better.

Yesterday i wantex to smoke, but i just did not do it. In the end it is easy. Just dont light one. 

I will get on a 10 h flight tomorrow and this will be nice. No smoking in the shady stinking little boxes before the flight.

I still ride my bike a lot and i know i told everybody to eat mandarins, well after 40 mandarins in 4 days i am sick of them. I will buy some other fruit today.

Thanks for the assistance, i know i will need it in the next couple weeks as well.

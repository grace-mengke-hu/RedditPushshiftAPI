If it wasn't for a friend, I would have caved last night. That grace saved me today.

Two friends of mine are brothers to one an other and one smokes and the other doesn't. The brother that doesn't had been ridiculing me over using a vapour device to stop smoking cigarettes. We all were drinking last night and I asked the brother that smokes for a cigarette. He said 'Fuck no, use your esmoke' and then on I felt like a tool. Later today, waiting for the bus, I almost bought a pack. The whole walk to the store I just kept thinking of the things that the brother who doesn't smoke was saying about quitting. That "everyone he knows that quit went cold turkey and carried a pack to satisfy the habit but not give into the craving." I was so tempted to do it. But I know if I have a pack I'll smoke it. I'll need to buy a lighter. I'll fall back to that habit. But I didn't. I've finally made it a month. I'm looking forward to seeing another month and another one after that. 

That's /r/stopsmoking

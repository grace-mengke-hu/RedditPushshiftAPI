two whole weeks tomorrow!

Never thought I could do it but I have managed to go 2 weeks without smoking. I won't say it was easy because sometimes it was really tough to not just reach out and have a smoke but I have found that we can be stronger than we think we are.  I have found the cravings had lessened for a day or two then BANG! one will come out at you full bore. I now really try to  understand each craving....I walk around it, look it up and down and try to really figure out why its there. I guess it helps me to treat quitting as a sort of "me against it" scenario. Addiction is an admirable foe, if you can defeat it , you are truly worthy of honour. It is cunning and totally immoral and will use any weakness against you but if you stand strong, it will eventually weaken and die. Not there yet but still standing and fighting the good fight. No smoking will occur here tonight!!

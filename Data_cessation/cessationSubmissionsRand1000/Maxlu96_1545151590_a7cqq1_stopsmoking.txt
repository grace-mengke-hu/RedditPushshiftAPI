I stopped smoking 870 days ago. On most days I don't even remember I used to smoke. But whenever I see the aging effects it has, I'm thankful I quit

I only smoked for about three years, but up to 40 cigarettes a day during the last one so I really felt the impact. Whenever I see people who have been smoking for a long time and how old they look, I am glad I stopped. I've met 25 year olds looking like they are 40 and you could tell it was from smoking. For the sake of yourself, carry on with quitting!

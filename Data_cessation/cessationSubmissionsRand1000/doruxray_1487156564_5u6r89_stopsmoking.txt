Giving myself a huge round of applause. 19 days!

I can not believe I got so far.... I turn 19 in 3 months and I've been smoking for 3 years around 10 cigarettes per day. Something inside me told me that I should stop, that it's not worth it. I also owe a huge thanks to my girlfriend. Having someone support you helps a ton. I tried one year ago to quit and I got to 3 weeks, but I know for sure this time Im not relapsing!

Struggling past few weeks

Well I have made it past the 30 day mark, this Wednesday will be 6 weeks smoke free!!! I was using the patches, and things were hard but I was managing. I went into the hospital for my knee replacement surgery on the 13th, I was in for 4 days, so I had no patches on, when I came out I was nicotine free so decided to continue that!! Wow it has been different, I mean I still have no problem saying NO to my wanting a smoke, the wants are there way more then before, or more prominent I don't know. I had a medical problem a week after getting out of the hospital and had to go back in because of a cyst rupturing that developed in my surgical knee, again I wanted to smoke, I had to say NO NO NO NO, not another SMOKE! I did and I have managed to keep saying NO but it is harder then it was before. Surgery is an excuse, I know, I could come up with so many excuses everyday to start smoking again, the weather, the color of my hair, what ever the reason I just have to continue to be strong and keep saying NO!!!!
One of the biggest things I have to over come right now is not being able to do something when the urge to smoke comes up, before surgery I would just get up go do something, clean, walk, what ever it took. Now with my knee s it is, I can't do anything so it is harder to fight that urge, or at least mentally it feels harder!!!

Checking in... almost 72 hours

It's 2:11 a.m., I'm at work at the rehab center and there's nothing much to do until clients start getting up. I'm mildly craving a cigarette but there are no cigarettes to be had, anyway. I had a piece of nicotine gum on my way to work a couple of hours ago. I think I'll wait an hour or two longer before having another one.

I've ridden my bicycle to the health club two days in a row. I plan to do it again when I get off work in a few hours. My breathing has already improved noticeably. I am starting to feel gunk loosen up when I cough.

Between working out for four days and not smoking for three, my appetite is through the roof. I'm trying to not indulge my cravings with too much unhealthy food. Unfortunately, sometimes I have to make due with whatever leftovers remain from dinner in the kitchen. At least I'm getting my cardio in. 

Thanks for reading.

I fucked it.

I took one draw after two weeks of nicotine free cold turkey . I realise that it was the worst decision of my life.

I'm going straight back on my quit. I fucked up. I hate what I've done and I don't want to endure the hell week again.
 But I will.
 I want to. 
It teaches me. 
I've quit a few times before, I'll quit a million times again.  Until I finish the quit.

Trying to quit finding certain times hard

Hey everyone, this is my first time on this site so sorry if I am not using it properly! 
I smoked since I was about 16, now 24 and on day 2 of quitting. I have a cheap little vape pen but it's not really helping as much as I thought it would. After meals and when first waking up I feel like I could explode I need one so badly. It's at those times I use the vape pen the most but I'm constantly on it for about half an hour and still don't get what I'm looking for from it. 

My chest is feeling really tight today. I go to bootcamp exercise classes multiple times a week with no problem but today after not smoking for two days could barely breathe just walking to the shops. 

Any advice or suggestions would be really gratefully received. The only think I've found does help a bit is always having a packet of mints on the go, but I feel I may become addicted to them too! 

Thanks! I'm Charly by the way ðŸ˜Š

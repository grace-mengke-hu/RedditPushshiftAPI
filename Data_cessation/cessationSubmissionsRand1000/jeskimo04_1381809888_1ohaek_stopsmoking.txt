I just smoked my last cigarette.

I WILL NOT SMOKE ANOTHER ONE!

I have been planning this quit for the last week. I stopped on the side of the road on my way back to my hometown. It was a cold windy rainy night. But I smoked it, made sure I watched myself step on it after I was done, and crushed whatever was left in my pack underneath my tire as I left.
I gotta do this.

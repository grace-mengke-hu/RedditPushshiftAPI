Hip hip, hooray

Three weeks...wow.  Only five days without NRT, but 21 without a cigarette is hard to believe.

Some of you may remember a story I told about finding the "emergency stash" in my truck?  Three smokes I immediately gave away to the nearest smoker friend.  Well, I can top that one...

Two days ago I got in my truck to clean it and realized I still had some empty packs in my door and such (you all know how it is!).  Went in my center console just to make sure and saw two empty boxes buried under manuals and forms.  Shook the first, nada...shook the second...**gasp** there was *still one in there*.  As I said in my previous story, cue the 10/10 craving.  Angels singing, light from the sky, etc. etc...

Rolled down my window, held it in my fingers, took a big smell (you know that three-second sniff along the length of the cigarette) to enjoy the fresh smell of tobacco...then broke it in half and threw it into the wet parking lot and drove away.  F*ck you, Marlboro.

I'm not a big believer in this whole community support thing (in general, not just for smoking).  I just don't mesh well with it.  This is my first time trying a "support group" of sorts, and it is working...so thanks.  You all have been a big help with listening, accountability, and advice.

Cheers, and good luck/well done to all of you here.

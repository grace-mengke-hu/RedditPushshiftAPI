HOLY SHIT the smells!

I was waiting for my improved sense of smell to hit me and I was worried it wouldn't. This morning I smelt my house (and considering the fact that I live with 3 men, it wasn't too pleasant.)

I could smell my hair and laundry detergent all day and GET THIS GUYS: I can smell the body wash on my skin from this morning. I didn't even know this was possible before I started smoking. Magic, I tell you. Magic.

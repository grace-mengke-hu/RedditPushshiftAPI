Weird dreams

So last night I woke up at 3am dreaming I was choking and couldn't breathe, was terrifying, untill I realised I could take nice deep breaths without coughing. My daughters cough has also drastically improved. Also dreamed I was back with my old school friend buying cigs togeather again! So random!

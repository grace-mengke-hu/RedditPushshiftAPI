My journey so far

I decided to quit last April and for a while I really didn't smoke at all. However within the last April and now there's been a couple of setbacks I experienced. First off somewhere along the way maybe 7 or 8 months in I was really stressed out and depressed and so I went to a smoke shop and bought an e-cig and that turned out to be a slippery slope because I found myself getting addicted to those the same way I got addicted to cigs, because nicotine duh. 

Also there was a couple of times before that where I bought a pack of cigarettes. Each time I smoked about a half of one before I would throw it out and leave the pack somewhere. 

I realized soon after that I couldn't mess around with e-cigs or cigarettes so every now and then (not more than once a month) I buy a black and mild and thats that.

I don't care to hear that I need to start over my count or anything like that. For me the all or nothing attitude can get really toxic for me so I choose not to count or think about how many months I've been a nonsmoker. I don't plan on ever smoking cigarettes again or using nicotine habitually either. I just wanted to share my journey and show that all progress is not linear and that it does not have to be all or nothing AFTER OF COURSE YOU HAVE GONE COLD TURKEY FOR AN EXTENDED AMOUNT OF TIME. Because I am a firm believer in going cold turkey until you can go about your life not constantly thinking about cigarettes :)

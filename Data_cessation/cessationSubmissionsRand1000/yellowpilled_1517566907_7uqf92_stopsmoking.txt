Bought myself a nice watch from the money saved

Always wanted to have a watch but never bought one cuz I'm a student and didnt want to spend so much money on something with little to no use. As a celebration of saving over 350â‚¬ as a non smoker and as a reminder that I'm stronger than I expected myself to be (besides quitting smoking I had a really, really rough time the last 10 weeks emotionally and mentally)

Wish you all the best, it's still one of the best feelings to know that I'm free!

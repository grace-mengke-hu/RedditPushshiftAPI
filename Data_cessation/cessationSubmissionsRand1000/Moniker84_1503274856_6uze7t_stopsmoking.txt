So close..

I walked over to the store just now with every intention of buying a pack..  I walked around longer than I needed to singing "watch me quit and watch me not  smoke" to the beat of the whip nee nee song (which is my weird coping mechanism while I've been quitting) over and over in my head. I thought of my daughters who are so proud of me and the sentence my oldest said to me as I left for the store  'don't cheat Momma' 
And instead of buying those deliciously wonderful Newport Reds I wanted oh so bad... Instead I bought my babies each a pack of animal cookies.  I made it through the hardest moment I've had yet.  It was so hard.
 I literally let out a grunt at the counter as the cashier rang up my cookies and asked me if there was anything else. As I paid I squeezed my eyes closed hard to keep the tears in.  This is the hardest thing I've ever fukkin done.

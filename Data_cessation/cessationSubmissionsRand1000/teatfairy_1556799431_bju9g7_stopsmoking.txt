Well I slipped up in december..

I've been smoking ever since. I just smoked my last cigarette,  mainly because I just woke up and smoked on auto pilot ðŸ™„. I'm going to put the patch on in a couple hours and stock up on cinnamon gum. I'm going to have my boyfriend take the remaining cigarettes to work with him so the temptation isnt driving me nuts.

I've been too ashamed to post here, I was doing so well. ðŸ˜”

I'm gonna try again though!

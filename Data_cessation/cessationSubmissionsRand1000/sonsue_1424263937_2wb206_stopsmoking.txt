I jogged 4 out of the 5 for the first time today.

I have been attempting to get back in shape since quitting smoking. I have exercised a minimum of 30 minutes a day every day since stubbing out my last cigarette including "running" 3 times a week. I put running in quotes because the road back has not been pretty. I have been very careful to build myself up slowly as I'm prone to shin splints and other impact related fatigue injuries. I have a 5km course and have alternated between running and walking. Today I ran 4 out of the 5 kilometers (3 in one stretch) and it felt pretty damn good. Past me during my military days (pack a day plus smoker) would have laughed at my 34:20 5km time (He ran 3 miles in 20-23 minutes) but screw him, he smoked. 

I really feel like I'm turning a corner on this quit thing. Hopefully by the end of the month I can run a 5K without stopping. 

I'm sharing this not only because I'm proud of myself but also because I believe exercise is playing a crucial role in my quit. Seeing and feeling tangible results have kept my motivation and resolution strong. 

I hope everyone of you quitters has as good a day as I'm having.

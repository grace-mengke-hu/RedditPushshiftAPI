I've never in my life been so excited to be sick

Haha! Woke up this morning with a cold, maybe it's the smoker's cold!!! Or should I say, the newly minted non-smoker's cold, because of course I am not a smoker, I am non-smoker. Woohoo! I hadn't gotten it yet so I hope this is it. I never pick up viruses, I don't think I've had a cold or the flu in at least five years if not longer, so I would be surprised if I have an actual cold, I think (hope) this is just all that yucky stuff working its way out. Bring it on mofo, bring it on! :D

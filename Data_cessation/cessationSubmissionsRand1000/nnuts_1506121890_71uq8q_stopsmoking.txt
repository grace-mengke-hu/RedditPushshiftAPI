8 days in (with NRT) having a meltdown inside my head

I'm not craving cigarettes, I'm just feeling incredibly mentally unstable.  Can't stop having repetitive negative thoughts, can't make myself do anything useful, can't sleep...  It's infuriating and being mad at myself about it isn't making things any better!  I think perhaps I should go out for a walk or something, but I'm afraid I'll end up at a bar instead and I really don't have the money to waste there.  I've got plenty of nicotine in me, what's my problem???

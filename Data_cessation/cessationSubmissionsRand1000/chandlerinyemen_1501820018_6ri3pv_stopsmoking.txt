Just flushed the rest of my pack. I'm so done with this shit.

I tried to quit a few weeks ago and only made it three days. But lately I've been experiencing chest pains and it's got me scared as hell. I can't risk leaving my son without a mother and I'm tired of literally giving my life to cigarettes. Wish me luck.

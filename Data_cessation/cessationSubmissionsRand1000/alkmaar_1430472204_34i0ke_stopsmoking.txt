Reddit, Help me quit smoking (again)!

I'd done it before. For 5 months i hadn't inhaled a single drag of nicotine in my system. I felt amazing, slept awesome, was on top of my gym routine and was twice as productive. Since quitting i had a lot going on in my life (Moved to another country) and got back on the nico-beast again. 

The fact that cigarettes in Australia are ridiculously expensive doesn't help either. It seems like half my weekly wage goes into cigarettes. While i did try quitting in between, i wouldn't last 24 hours mostly cause i currently live with two smokers and stress has been out of the roof with uni, work and so on..

I decided to get back on my old routine. Got a gym membership today and will start working out again starting tomorrow. I also want to quit smoking simultaneously but i need as much advice as i can get from you guys. The first week seems impossible to go through given my environment where everyone is smoking almost every single second. Whatitdo guys?

Edit: Ignore my badge, i had it activated since my last attempt at quitting.

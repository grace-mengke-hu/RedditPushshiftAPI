Every single workday I would get home over 97% nicotine free

Today is my last day smoking, and I am reading Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking. It turns out after 8 hours, 97% of the nicotine from your last cigarette is already out of your bloodstream.

I would never smoke while at work. I would get up, smoke, shower, go to work, and come back some 9 hours after my last cigarette before lighting up again. I rarely if ever had cravings - in fact, I can't remember ever having a craving at work when I knew I could smoke when I got home.

That is just flabbergasting me right now. Five days a week for the past 6 years, I wouldn't even notice physical symptoms of withdrawal, and because I knew it wasn't gone forever, I rarely if ever experienced a mental craving.

Reminder to not start over - it sucks!

My friend quit 3 days ago, and in talking to her I’m vividly remembering how much it suuuuuuccckkkeeeddd. It’s crazy how easily we forget and want to smoke again. 

Here’s to NOT STARTING OVER EVER AGAIN. 

I feel so much better now at 55 days. I still have really hard moments, but they are situational and not constant like they were before. If you are struggling, just try to hit 1 month. I feel like that was a massive turning point in the constant frustration. After that, it’s really been flying by! 

I believe in you all. You really can totally do this.

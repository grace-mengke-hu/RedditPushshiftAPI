A Poem for My Fellow Quitters

As of the 25th of December,

200 days have I dismembered,

this filthy habit from my daily existence,

I no longer need nicotine for my subsistence...



I hope that you, on this joyous day,

proclaim your victory against this bane,

that lurks in the background of your every moment,

like an ill-watered plant or forgotten fulfillment...



A hearty meal, a stiff drink,

need not drive you to the brink,

nor should it trigger you asunder,

to make another smoking blunder...



May you soldier on, confident and proud,

At parties, work meals and at your family's house,

Knowing you'll never need consider,

the need to set a cancer stick a flicker...



Merry Christmas to all of you.  Be proud and strong this holiday season, and a Happy New Year to you all too!

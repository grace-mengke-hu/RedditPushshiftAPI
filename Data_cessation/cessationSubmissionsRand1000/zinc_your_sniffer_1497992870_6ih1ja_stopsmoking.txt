40M quitting after smoking 1-2 packs a week since age of 18, and grew up in house with mother who smoked.

Always figured I didn't smoke enough for it to be an issue, but I am nervous as hell. Have been reading that quitting by age 40 can almost restore all lost years. Any tips as to whether I should cut down gradually or just go cold turkey?

Edit: I am brand new to this sub and think it's so awesome to see all the support you guys provide to each other.

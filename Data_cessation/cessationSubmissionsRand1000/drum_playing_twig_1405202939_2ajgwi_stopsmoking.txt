I smoked for a year and am now smoke free. What irreversible damage has the smoking already caused?

I'm 29 years old. I smoked for one year and quit 43 days ago.

I'm curious, have I already done a lot of damage to myself from the year of smoking? What irreversible damage has already taken place in my body?

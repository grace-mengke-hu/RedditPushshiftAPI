7 days! Take that cigarettes!

Today is a great day, and wanting to smoke is the last thing on my mind, actually it is not even on my mind! 

Day 4 and 5 were horrendous, but I powered through and I am so glad I did, then day 6 was fine, I even went out for a few drinks last night sat with smokers and didn't smoke. Don't get me wrong the craving was really bad but luckily I overcame it and had friends who wouldn't let me give in either. 

Thank you all for your help so far, couldn't do this without you all! High fives all round.

Being left out by friends, smoking is my only entertainment

Hello everyone, I'm 18 and been smoking for 4 months. I don't have a lot of friends. Actually I'm being left out on purpose because of things I've done in the past. My only entertainment during the break time is to go outside and smoke a cigarette with a few other people while others hang out together. I feel like it has become a part of me and I feel weird/awkward if I don't smoke around others. I don't even crave for a cig when I'm alone but as soon as I go to school, the loneliness strikes and I find myself smoking again. I really want to quit before it's too late.

Have you ever had something like this happen to you? I could really use some advice, thanks!

Just stopped last night. Questions included!

Finally decided to stop, after 8 years. I've tried before, but now... I really need to, so I can change myself into the person I want to be. I downloaded Cessation Nation (because it's more fun when it's a game, even though it's my life).

Questions: What is this Allen Carr book that everyone keeps talking about? What physiological/psychological changes should I be watching out for? I've been getting dizzy, is that normal?

Thank you all for any help!

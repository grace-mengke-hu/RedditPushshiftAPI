Slapped a patch on this morning

I've been smoking for 10 years now. I'm 24 and while I love cigarettes, I hate them and I hate myself for being such a slave to them.
I'm sick of this repeating cycle of self loathing and instant gratification. I've quit twice for two months and then got back into it, always around friends, even though they smelled and tasted disgusting. 
My entire family smoked when I was younger and some still do. I love coffee and cigarettes, alcohol and cigarettes, sex and cigarettes, conversation and cigarettes. The problem is that I enjoy them, but I want so desperately to quit, to not smell like an ashtray, to not have to excuse myself every hour or two (way more when I'm drinking) from whatever I'm doing to smoke.
I started a pretty uneventful class today and even though I'm sitting here wearing this patch I can't stop thinking about the sensation in my lungs, the smell, etc. 
Any advice, tips or motivational words would be greatly appreciated. Anyone have any luck with patches? Should I even dare drink any time soon?

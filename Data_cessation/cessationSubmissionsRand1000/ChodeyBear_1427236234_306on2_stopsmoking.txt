I'm depressed and I know no other place to post this where I'd get the support I need.

R/depression is full of suicide stories that I don't think help me. 

R/stress is empty. 

This doesn't reeeeally relate directly to smoking but is something that nonetheless puts smoking on my mind. 

I'm depressed and can't get through it. This particular episode has been going on since December and I'm pretty fed up as you can imagine. 

I completely function and am fine on a day to day basis. Nobody recognises what's up unless I tell them - I've tried to start opening up a bit. 

I'm not really sure what i'm looking for. I don't think the generic 'smoking wouldn't make anything better' kind of posts will quite cut it. I'm not actually planning on smoking. But I'm just feeling genuinely, really really shit. 

I've not been to the docs in the last couple of months so maybe another trip would be helpful. 

Sort of just needed to vent! Thanks in advance.

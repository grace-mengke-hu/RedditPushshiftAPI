1 month and a few days clean struggling with depression and anger

I've been crying a bunch the past few days. Exploding over small issues. Unable to focus at work. Feels like my skin is crawling. I've been off chantix for like 3 weeks. Could it have messed up my head?

 I'm going to see a psychiatrist. 

I'm feeling pretty hopeless and depressed and I wanna smoke again but I can't justify the awful slow death it will give me despite my depression. I feel like I'm weaker than everyone in this sub. Noone seems to understand. Maybe I'm just mentally defective.

 I'll have one good day followed by 3 days where I keep obsessing about smoking. I must've watched 30 whyquit.com videos. 

Anyway I won't smoke for today but holy Christ I didn't think it would still be this tough over a month in.

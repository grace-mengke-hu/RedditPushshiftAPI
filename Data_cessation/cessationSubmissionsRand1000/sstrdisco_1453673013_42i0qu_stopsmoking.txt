It's ok to not drink when you're are quitting smoking.

If you're like me, drinking and smoking went hand in hand. Drinking was certainly a trigger to smoke and it set my cravings off. Knowing this, when I did quit smoking, I gave up drinking for about six weeks. Even now I have to stop at three or I want a smoke so bad I could punch my mom.

"8 beers in and still haven't smoked!" It's not a contest. It doesn't make you look macho. You're putting yourself in a slippery situation.

So, just in case no one has mentioned it, it's really ok to not drink while quitting smoking. It will even make your journey easier.

As a side note, I hope I don't sound like I'm on my soap box. I don't want to. I just hate seeing people torture themselves.

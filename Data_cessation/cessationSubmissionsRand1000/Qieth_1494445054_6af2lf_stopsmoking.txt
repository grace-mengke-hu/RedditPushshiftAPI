Day 1, cold turkey. I feel great!

It's been aaaalmost 24 hours since my last cigarette, and I'm very pleasantly surprised at how I'm feeling. I feel the physical sensation in my body, and while it feels a little funny, I can certainly endure it. 

In the past when I've tried to quit cold turkey, I've always felt woozy, dizzy, almost drunk. I feel this sensation now, but not nearly as bad as I have before. I feel very optimistic about quitting. 

Oh, for sure, I have caught myself reaching for my cigarette-pocket many times today. But there are no cigarettes there. They are gone, and I don't even carry a lighter anymore. Each time I reach for my pocket, I stop halfway and say "Oh right, I quit smoking". 

I think this is where the difference is. I'm not "trying to quit". I have decided to quit. If I want to have a cigarette, I have to decide to become a smoker again, and I don't want to make that decision. 

I feel at ease. I feel the tingling in my fingers, and the weird sensation in my lungs, but I know that this is not withdrawal - it's recovery. I am choosing not to suffer, but instead enjoy that my body is trying to recover. 

Its weird, I would have never thought I would feel excited about quitting, but I honestly can't wait for tomorrow.

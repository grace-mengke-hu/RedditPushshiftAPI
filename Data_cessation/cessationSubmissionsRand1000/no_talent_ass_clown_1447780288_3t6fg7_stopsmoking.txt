Just turned down a smoke that I really, really wanted.

For the first time since I quit I really wanted to smoke and I didn't have my vaporizer with me. I've been traveling and finally met some people I could really talk to, and we were shooting the shit on a rooftop for hours, and they both smoke and man was it hard to turn that down.

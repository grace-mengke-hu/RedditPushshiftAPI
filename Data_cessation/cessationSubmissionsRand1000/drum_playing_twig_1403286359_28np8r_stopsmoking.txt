3 weeks. When will I start hating cigarettes? Because I think about them constantly.

Even though it's been three weeks I constantly think about smoking. When will I feel zero emotional, physical, or mental attraction towards the cancer sticks?

So it's been 3 weeks now, since I quit. I quit for health reasons and for financial reasons. I've started running so I'm loving the deeper breaths I can take. I also like having more money in my wallet. 

However, I still feel weak. I know that if some big miserable thing happened in my life, I would instantly start smoking again. Because god damn I miss it. 

I can't fool myself and mindlessly convince myself I hate cigarettes. Yes, I hated what they did to my health and finances but I loved how they made me feel. Relaxed, calm, no worries in the world. Hakuna Matata! But now I'm all edgy and irritable all the time. And it's been 3 weeks!!

Here we go....

Been smoking for 35 years. I have chosen this Wednesday as my quit date. Iâ€™m tired of feeling like crap all the time. Tired of stinking of stale smoke. Tired of not sleeping at night. Just tired of all of it.

I know that cravings will hit me hardest while driving to &amp; from work (about 40 minutes each way). Help, tips, suggestions on how to get through it?

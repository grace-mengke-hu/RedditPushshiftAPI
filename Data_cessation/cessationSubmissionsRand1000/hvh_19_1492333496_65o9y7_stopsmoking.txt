I hate that I smoke. 
I'm terrified of the consequences of smoking (you know, the big C word.)
I don't want to smoke anymore. I don't want to use substitutes either. I just want to stop. 

I've been very nasal the last few days and my ears feel all blocked up, I've been gardening and i'm sure this is just allergies but I am also terrified that its something more serious. 

I started smoking in my teens, probably 16 properly. I turn 26 next month and I really REALLY want to stop this habit. Can people please share what tipped them over the edge and finally kicked this disgusting habit? I need to get there. I need to stop doing this to myself.

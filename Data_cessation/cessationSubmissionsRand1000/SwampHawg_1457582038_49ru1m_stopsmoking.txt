This is my first time cutting weight without nicotine, and it's a fair sight harder

My weight's always been kind of up and down between 190 and 220, and I usually just have to take 6-8 weeks in the spring to drop Winter's 20lbs.  

I quit smoking this past August, and this Winter I kind of let it all hang out on the gluttony and sloth fronts, and without a cigarette to signal meals' ends I ballooned up to 235.  So I had my look in the mirror 3 weeks ago (about the time my fat pants were getting too tight to button) and set to it, and I'm 3 weeks in and i've been good, very healthy food and daily exercise.  And I've dropped 7lbs, more tortoise than hare, but it's a doable thing.

But it's def harder without nicotine.  On top of losing the appetite suppressant, you really can drown a lot of sorrows in a smoke.  Whereas now you gotta take the pain of dietary sacrifice right on the chin.

This is not a lament, quitting is the best thing i've done in a long time and I'm happy to be rid of them.  The benefits have been enormous.  And once I get this weight took off, and I don't care how damn hard it is, I'm gonna have a lot coming together all at once.  

So, you know, let's all do this thing, wherever you are.

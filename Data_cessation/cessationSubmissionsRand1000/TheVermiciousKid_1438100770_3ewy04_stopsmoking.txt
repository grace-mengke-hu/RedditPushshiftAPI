Hello three months!

Feels good. I keep noticing *not* being out of breath when I run back up the stairs to get something. I don't even think about smoking very often any more. Do I miss it? Yup, definitely. But it's easier to miss something that doesn't pop into your mind very often, especially when you can see how good it is to be without it.

Still on Day 1. So many triggers.

After breakfast. After a quick coffee. While reading a good feature article. As a reward for a accomplishing a part of a project. 

Writing something. Talking to my younger brother. Waiting for hot water to boil. Playing the guitar.

Still halfway through my day. Still smoke-free.

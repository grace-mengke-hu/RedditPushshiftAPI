Two weeks I feel so wonderful

Just wanted to share and say thanks to everyone. 

Try everything you need to. Lurk here. Read up (including Allen Carr!). I did it all and this time it's cold turkey.

I'm fucking loving my life the last 2 weeks. I barely even think about smoking. But I will say- I'm not really around cigarettes or smokers much except when I go out at night. I'm still everyday astonished when I sit at a bar for an hour with a friend and no one is smoking. I've realized the two do NOT have to go hand in hand and for most people, they don't! I only encounter smokers here and there. My SO is a non smoker and my closest friends are non smokers or have already quit. So this helps. If you need to limit your time around these people the first few weeks or so then do it.

For me I think that's helped but honestly my whole mindset has changed now as well. I wouldn't trade how I feel now for anything. I love myself and I'm being good and proper to myself. I look good,smell good,feel good, laugh louder. I sip a good whiskey and the flavors excite my taste buds. I treat myself. I've always loved food and drink but it had gotten to the point I couldn't get through a meal without going outside for a cigarette. Something annoying was always nagging at me!! That feeling is gone! I'm in no hurry whatsoever. I can't explain how good that feels. And yes the flavors are...better than smoking ever was. 

I write these things to help pay it forward. I want you to know if you're just starting- above all else- not smoking is more enjoyable than smoking. I promise you. It will be worth it. Like Allen Carr says, you're "giving up" nothing positive when you see what it's like on the other side.

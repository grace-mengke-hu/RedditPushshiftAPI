oops. fell off the wagon. getting back on today.

Dammit, I was just about to get me a one year star and go all preachy on y'all about how easy this quitting is. (I was about 6 or 7 weeks away).

So I have been under severe stress (like for real), and I'd been out drinking and had a few smokes. Then I went out again and had just a couple more. Then I bought a pack (we know how this goes, right). So that was five weeks ago. To hell with the stress, I'm a big boy. I'm quitting again.

My takeaways..... 

* NOPE (Not One Puff Ever) should be practiced. Having a smoke while out drinking..... it's what's got me every time. 
* Being back on smokes is HORRIBLE. Having to step out every 45 minutes, having that nasty roughness in the throat and lungs, being that slave where you gotta plan everything around access to a cigarette.
* The perspective of seeing both sides non-smoking vs smoking is helpful. Being a non smoker is waaaay better. All them things I had to let go of before..... things I thought I'd "miss". That's all bullshit in hindsight. So at least I don't have to go through THAT. 

So hello again, all my fellow quitters. It's not good to be back.... but it's great that you're here.

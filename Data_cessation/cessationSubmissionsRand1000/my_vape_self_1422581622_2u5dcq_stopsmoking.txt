Call for papers: I really love smoking. NOT.

Frequently, someone will post saying, "I know I should quit, but *[all together now]* I *really* **love** smoking. "

I usually write something like this:
> I used to say that.  I believed it to be true.  I don't know what you could have told me to change my mind.  I know now that it was not true.  It never was.



But I've been reading about the smokes with mates, the back decks, the summer barbecue, camping, pretty much everything; all the romance, all the nostalgia.

It is a recipe for disaster (for your quit), so I thought we should open the conversation.  

So Romeos and Juliets, tell us of your love.  Those who have gotten out of that play and are no longer taking poison, tell us how you escaped.

**I'll start:**

 I had read Carr and I knew that right after smoking I felt like ten.  Then that ebbed away and in two hours, I felt like a 7.  Having a cigarette took me back to a ten.  Doing that many times a day for years taught my lizard brain that cigarettes were a +3 drug of happiness.

And it was a lie.  Cigarettes were a -3 decaying addiction.  I could spend the rest of my life cycling from 3-down to *almost* normal.  Or I could just sit close to normal and not ride in circles.  That is what I chose.

I was at a barbecue this summer.  Neat and cool people were there.  After dark the cigars, the single malt and musical instruments came out.  I had a wonderful time.  I did not smoke because it wasn't going to add anything.

And by the way,  I did not smoke today.

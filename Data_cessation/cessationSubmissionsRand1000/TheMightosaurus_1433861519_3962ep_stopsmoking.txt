If you need an excuse to quit - I'll give you one

So I smoked 20 a day for the past 6, 7 years or so. I stopped smoking about a month ago with the use of patches. A few weeks after I quit my gums started to bleed randomly, I have just been to see a hygienist and it turns out i have borderline gum disease (though thankfully I'm at a stage where I can reverse this) 

The hygienist informed me that through smoking, it causes us to lose saliva in our mouths, which protects against bacteria. Our gums wont bleed hardly at all, apparently if you have really bad gum disease you would have to scrub at your gums quite vigorously to see any bleeding. So smoking really does mask all these terrible issues. 

I'm so glad I stopped smoking, if I had continued on I would have undoubtedly developed gum disease and have a serious issue on my hands (and I probably wouldn't even have noticed)   

If you're on the fence, please just do it for your own sake. The people on this subreddit are so supportive, the cigarettes will destroy your life. I'm now experiencing my body slowly rebuilding itself after I tried to kill it for 6 years, sure I cough a little now and then, my gums are bleeding - but that's only because I'm on the road to being a NORMAL HEALTHY human being again. 

YOU CAN DO IT!! I BELIEVE IN YOU!!!

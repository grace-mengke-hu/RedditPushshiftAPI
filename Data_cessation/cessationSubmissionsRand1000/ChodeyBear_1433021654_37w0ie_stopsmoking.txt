2 weeks til a year

I've still been struggling, to be honest. I don't want to sugarcoat it for you newer quitters. I totally took the positive mindframe on board for the first 6 months. Then it totally went to shit. I've been able to keep mind over matter though in all situations. Including this evening. Drunken argument with the boyfriend. But I've chosen more beer and skipping a meal over smoking. Not the healthiest options, but tons better than smoking. 

No doubt I'll be posting again in 2 weeks!

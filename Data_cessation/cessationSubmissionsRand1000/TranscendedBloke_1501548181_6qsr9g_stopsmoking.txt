It's now or never

This is the mentality I'll use to shrug it off, I just smoke what is to be called my last cigarette under Moonlight Sonata, thought I'd end it with something poetic. I wrote on my wrist "don't" just to shut off the auto pilot, that's what I've used for all my other previous addictions. Tried it on smoking once but I broke it by convincing myself a systematic stopping is the way, but now that I'm sure it's not I'll use it to my advantage. 

Awareness will be my weapon, the moment I read "don't" surges of positive thoughts will appear, I spent an hour writing and memorizing by heart the cons of smoking, which is basically all what smoking offers. The smell, breathing, health, decayed teeth, the bother, financials, being a slave to the industry, being mentally beaten brutally over something that I want but not need, something I figured out recently. I'm going to self hypnotize myself in a minute just to make sure. I left a single cigarette in my pack and threw it away, subtly telling my brain not to buy one. 

I can't believe I spent almost 10000$ on.. 0 value, I was only endorsing money in the wrong side of the equation.

Wish me luck gentlemen, I'm gonna need it.

Day 8

At the end of the night, I will now have day 8 of being smoke-free under my belt but I’m really starting to miss it.  Just the whole routine of smoking under the stars, puffing away while everything is quiet and still.  It mellowed me out and gave me a sense of comfort and peace and I’m really struggling to find that same kind of relaxation elsewhere.  Day 8 seems significantly harder than anything that has come before and I’m just desperately trying to stay strong.

3 rd day of no smoke .

I know its getting boring , people coming and rambling about their success stories but I can't help to say something here.
 * The third day was not bad , I didn't crave for cigratte while walking back from office ,neither did I feel the urge to buy cigrattes when I saw guys smoking away at the shop I daily had smoked in the evening so that was a big plus 
* all the way back from office, I was thinking about this subreddit and all the success stories , which people have gone through to achieve freedom from smoking 
* listening to people telling they have been smoking for 20/years , 15 years , 17 years a part of me told " hey buddy you can still smoke for aome more  time , you have only smoked for 5 years maximum, " .. But I am telling you I am not going to smoke  I don't want to .
 Thanks people for reading this .

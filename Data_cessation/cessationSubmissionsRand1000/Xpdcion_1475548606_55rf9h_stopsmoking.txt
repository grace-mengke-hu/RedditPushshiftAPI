Having a dream of lighting a cigarette

So 2 weeks or so ago, I dreamt of myself smoking a cigarette with my brother. It felt so great but then I realized that I broke my oath that I would never smoke a cigarette ever again and it made me felt like shit and woke up. It was so weird until I had another dream of me smoking this time with my friends. It still felt good but I also once again felt disappointed about it.

I never had that type of dream back when I was a smoker.

Is this normal? Did you guys experienced this too? I'm on my 40 days nicotine free

After many many failed attempts, I made it a month!

Thank you SO MUCH to this subreddit for helping me.  Some things I noticed during the past month:

1) For the first 5 days, each morning when I woke up, the first I did was check the stop smoking app.  On day 6 I a few hours passed before I remembered to look at it.

2) I had A LOT of bad dreams during weeks 2 and 3.  Most of them weren't actually about smoking, but I'm pretty sure they were all caused by the nicotine monster crying out for more.  I dreamed about smoking last night, so I imagine smoking dreams will keep happening once in a while.

3) The nicotine stain on my finger has disappeared completely!

4) I don't break out into a cold sweat after running a block or 2 anymore.  (I miss the bus a lot, so this has been really nice.)

5) The skin on my face is oiler than before, probably because it no longer lives in a cloud of smoke.  This kind of sucks, but I'm confident that it will adjust.  Also, my lips aren't nearly so dry.

I'm not sure what made this attempt successful, but not my many other attempts.  I hesitate to say this, because I'm a firm believer in not another puff, not ever, but I will say it anyway: I think each of my failed attempts made me more resilient.  Once I mastered not smoking for 1 day, 1 day became easy, but 2 days was too hard.  Once I made it 2 days, 2 days became easy, but 3 days was hard.  I finally made it through 3 days...and here I am now.  Somehow 3 days turned into 30.

If you can make it through 3 days, you can make it through 30, no matter how many times you've tried to quit before.

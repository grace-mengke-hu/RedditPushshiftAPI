Quitting with anxiety disorders

Hi everyone! I've been lurking on this sub for a couple of months now. I've been smoking 2 packs a day for 16 years, and I am ready to quit. 

I have really bad anxiety, at least one or two panic attacks a day, plus a terrible phobia of driving. When I am having bad anxiety or a full-blown panic attack, I chain smoke. How can I get through this without smoking?

I have about 10 cigarettes in my last pack. I gave away one and a half cartons (yes, cartons) last night because I promised myself today would be my quit day. I keep telling myself just one more, then I am throwing the rest of the pack out, but my anxiety has been really bad today, and I am having trouble forcing myself to just be done with these nasty things.

Sorry for rambling. I'm a bit of a scrambled egg right now!

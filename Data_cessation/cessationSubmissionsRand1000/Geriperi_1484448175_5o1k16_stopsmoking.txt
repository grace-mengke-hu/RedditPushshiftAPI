The amazing help of the veterans

I came here, at first, to read the cases of people like me that starts quitting. And I do read them, and its great to know you can help and be helped by people in your same situation. BUT. You guys who have quit a year, two, three years ago and still come here to give your best advice, to motivate, to answer the rest of us that are still struggling...You veteran nonsmoker redditors are my heros and I thank all of you and your contribution here.

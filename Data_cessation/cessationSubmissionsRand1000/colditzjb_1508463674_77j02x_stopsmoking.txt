Knowledge is not always power

One full week without cigarettes is the longest that I've managed to stitch together in the past couple of years, with many thanks to this community providing a chance to vent, ask personal questions, and sharing whatever personal experiences that I thought might be helpful for other quitters. 

I tried my first cigarette at 11 and I've been regularly smoking since I was 15... that's 20 long years ago. If you do the math, that's well-over half of my life as a smoker - damn! For the past decade, I've been researching a lot about addictions and smoking... not just hitting Google with random questions (though I do that too). I'm literally a researcher for a university medical school. Even knowing all of the health risks and quitting strategies, nothing has ever really clicked for me, and I've tried every damned strategy that has come across my desk. 

For the past few years I always kind of thought that I was some kind of special case: "I *only* smoke in the evenings or when I'm out drinking, so I'm not like those *other* smokers." Even getting to that point has been many hard-fought battles from when I was in my 20's and smoking morning-to-night, 1-2 packs a day. I had to re-learn how to drive without smoking, how to get through mornings and then afternoons without smoking, how to have a couple happy hour drinks with coworkers without letting on that I was having massive nicotine cravings (not really a "happy" hour). Every step was prolonging the inevitable and making me more miserable by degrees. Meanwhile, I'm in a field where I'm constantly reading and writing research articles about how smoking is killing people... talk about adding insult to injury!   

**Here's the thing:** *Knowing* isn't really half the battle... I've learned more than you would ever want to know about tobacco/vaping chemicals, lung cancer statistics, different quitting approaches, and social triggers that screw up quit attempts. You would think that all of this knowing should have led me to successfully quit smoking years ago... but it hasn't. *Quitting* **is** the battle and reading about quitting is not actually quitting. Please don't become a number in a depressing research report... do make a commitment to quit - set a badge - stop lurking and get posting - this community really seems to help! (there is some research about that too)

Please don't prolong the agony of quitting or spend 20 years waiting for enough knowledge to pile up to convince you to quit smoking the *best* way. Just give quitting a shot and check-in on this sub with your own questions and answers. Knowledge is not always power, but having community support definitely seems to help! 

I'll not smoke with you today!

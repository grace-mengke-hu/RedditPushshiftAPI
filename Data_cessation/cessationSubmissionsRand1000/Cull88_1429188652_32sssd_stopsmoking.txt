76 hours! Give this a read if you're feeling like shit!

I know im posting so soon after my last post (48 hours) but WOW. What a difference a day makes! honestly, last night, i felt distance, depressed, not with it, argued with everyone (mainly my girlfriend), genuinely thinking everyone was purposely trying to piss me off! but today, i feel great? honestly. It's like, THAT was it, THAT was the bad day i hear so much about. Honestly, guys, just power through! this is all cold turkey and my god, it IS the easiest way. Don't be fooled by NRT. I know I will probably have other bad days, but if I can get through how I felt yesterday, then i can get through it again!

Social smoker but i've finally began to stop!

As a social smoker, only smoking 30 a week at 19, It's probably not as difficult as it is some of you guys to stop. I just smoked when i drunk alcohol. 


But one morning I woke up and realised it's not worth the bad chest pains, the struggles of breathing and the 5minute breaks.

I've stopped now for 10 days and i'm not going to lie i feel so much better for it. I can breath so much easier, not coughing as much and my sleeping pattern is now perfect!

I un-subbed this sub-reddit because I thought I would never try to quit. Sorry. But now I'm so determined and even after being on 3 nights out I have turned down cigarettes and not had a problem.

Anyone lurking and thinking about it, do it... It'll be the best decision you will make and i'm saying that at 12 days!

I was smoking weekends (drinking days, so friday, saturday and sunday) for around 3 years. I've started full time on my e-cig and gone from 18mg of nicotine down to 6mg. It's all going really well thanks to you guys aswell.

Lets all keep it up, we can do it together!

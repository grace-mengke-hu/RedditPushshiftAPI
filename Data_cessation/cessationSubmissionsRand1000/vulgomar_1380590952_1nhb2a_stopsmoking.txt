2 weeks, *whew*.

Today was 2 weeks for me. It's been rough at times, but this sub has really helped me. It's so nice to have a community of people who understand what you're going through. Coming on here helps calm my nerves when I'm craving. Like right now.

I had a great day today with my son and was so happy that I didn't have to think about sneaking off for a smoke or using snus or something and I could just enjoy my time with him. It's amazing how much more I can focus on the present and enjoy myself without cigarettes.

These cravings have nothing on me. I'm never going back this time.

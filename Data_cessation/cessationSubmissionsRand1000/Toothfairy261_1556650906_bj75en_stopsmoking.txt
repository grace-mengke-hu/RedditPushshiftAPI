Almost two months

I dont want to get ahead of myself, but I'm doing a lot better then expected. Urges have died down tremendously and I couldn't be happier about that. 

It's been two months, and I'm down to the 7mg nicotine patch. 

In these two months, I smoked one full cigarette, which I immediately regretted...and then the other day, I lit up, took two hits, and nearly threw up. It was absolutely the most disgusting thing ever. 

Keep up the good work everyone!

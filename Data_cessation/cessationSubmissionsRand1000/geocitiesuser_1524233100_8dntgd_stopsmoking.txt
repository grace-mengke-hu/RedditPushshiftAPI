Should I be concerned I'm not coughing anything out?

Day 13...

I was a smoker for a long time, then I quit for like 5 years, and relapsed last december. I quit again when I had chain smoked two packs before 5pm and scared myself with how out of control I was.

The cravings are mostly gone, but the run down feeling is still there (like my dog died kind of feeling). But no coughing. Maybe I didn't smoke long enough to build up significant tar, despite the volume I was smoking? Was at 2 packs a day most of those 4-5 months.

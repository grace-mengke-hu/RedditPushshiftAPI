One year ago today, I tossed my ecig outside of the airport just before flying to see my parents for Christmas

Tomorrow morning, I'll go to the same airport to take the same flight home. This time, however, there won't be any nicotine withdrawals. 365 days without nicotine :). Here's to working to make this continue for the rest of my life.

Seriously, I really appreciate the advice and help I've received here over the years... (this wasn't my first attempt to quit.) I'm going to stop slacking and spend this next year helping some people on here so they can know this great feeling too.

Happy Holidays to everyone here. I hope to see a lot of resolutioners in the coming weeks.

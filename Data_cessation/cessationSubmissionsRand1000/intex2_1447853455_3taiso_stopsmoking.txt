100 FUCKING DAYS

Hi, /r/stopsmoking!

I am certain that this will be my last post on this sub. I am at 100 days of no tobacco, and will share my story in the hope that someone who is just starting out may gain inspiration from it. 

A little backstory first: I was a 5-6 a day smoker, and because of time and money constraints, I never really went above that number. I loved smoking, and I thought it was the best fucking thing about my life. I woke up in the morning and got to smoke. I ate a meal and got to smoke. Look at how depraved this addiction is! It actually makes you believe that it is the best thing you have in your life. I lived for those smokes after meals, during drinks, and with friends. Never thought of quitting. Didn't even consider it. Didn't want to do it. Why would I quit, I loved smoking. Do you want to quit jacking off? Do you want to quit TV? Do you want to quit reading? Of course not! Last thing I wanted to do was quit.

One day, I wandered into this sub. I was still a noob on reddit. Lurked for a while, really feeding off the vibes. Saw people turn their lives around. Motivated me just a tad. So I made my [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/3guh55/too_early_to_quit/). Asking people if it was too early to quit. The comments section was flooded with people urging me to quit immediately. And I thought... what the hell! Fuck it, I'm feeling lazy, so instead of going out and smoking, I downloaded Allen Carr and blazed through it in an hour. 

And I never smoked again. All because of a post on this sub. All because of you, who told me to quit. All because of you, who [reaffirmed my decision](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/3hf67m/the_hospital_scared_the_smokes_out_of_me/). All because of you, who [were there when I hit 15 days, my then longest streak ever](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/3ibto4/my_longest_streak_ever/). All because of you, who got me through that first month, and congratulated me when I crossed [that milestone](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/3kdjp3/one_month/). After a month or two, the disgusting smell itself is enough to repel you. I've had friends try to make me smoke, trying to put one in my mouth. I've had people be shocked and sad that I quit. Fuck that.

Thank you, /r/stopsmoking. You have changed my life.

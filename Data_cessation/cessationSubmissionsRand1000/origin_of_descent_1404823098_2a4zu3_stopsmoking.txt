Over 100 Days now... I forgot!

So it's been about 106 days since I've last had a cigarette. Over three months. A third of a year. I forgot until I checked an app I downloaded to help motivate me. I thought I'd post this milestone. I no longer smell. I can taste the food I eat. I have a girlfriend who doesn't cringe from the smell or fact that I inhale cancer. I have NOT smoked over 1000 cigarettes. I have saved over $500 which pays for flight costs on an upcoming vacation. I have learned to deal stress, anxiety, and depression in more productive and healthier ways. Quitting smoking will not solve your problems, I realize, but it will open new pathways to resolving and understanding them.

To those of you just starting your journey: keep at it. If you keep your mind occupied and your body satisfied (gum, food, mints, etc. for oral cravings), you won;t believe how fast time can go. 

When I had craving I came to this sub and all your advice, insight, and encouragement has kept me going, and quite honestly, I have no intention of turning back now.

Thanks, and woo-hoo!

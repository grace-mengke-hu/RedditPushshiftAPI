50 days!

Just stopping by really, any new quitters just realise it does get easier, i've got over the sleepless nights and mood ridden cravings, now when i get an urge, it doesn't put me in a mood, because i know i've won. I've been out drinking at the weekends and still haven't even come close to smoking. Really does get easy. Good luck to everyone starting, just man up and get on with it! realise that cravings really don't last forever and smoking a cigerette will do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

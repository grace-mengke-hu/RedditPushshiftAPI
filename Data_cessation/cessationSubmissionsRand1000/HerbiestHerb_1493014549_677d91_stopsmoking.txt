2 Weeks

I'm just proud to have gone 2 weeks without smoking. I've noticed that I have turned posting into a habit. Whether it's just acknowledging my own success or encouraging others, I really enjoying being smoke free and sharing with everyone. Hats off to you all for taking the step to free yourself, as I have done.

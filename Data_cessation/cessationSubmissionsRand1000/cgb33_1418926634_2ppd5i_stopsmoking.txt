Birthday battle

Today is my birthday & I've been smoke-free for just over 3 months. My birthday brain is trying to convince my newly non-smoker that I deserve a treat. By writing this, my non-smoker brain is fighting back & no cigarette is a treat! 
Give me strength tonight when I'm out.
Have a great day everyone!

10ish days, and I gained like 5 pounds. 

I haven't stopped eating. Smoking was my time killer, boredom breaker. Now instead of going out for a smoke I make a sandwich or grab some chips. Trading one habit for another. I was on the verge of smoking today to stop eating. Instead of coughing and wheezing I am full and slugish. I am fat, so its not like overeating is new but shit, quitting was a way to start being healthy. I know deciding to have a cigarette to stop eating would be rationalizing, its part of the addiction and what not. Shit though, I leave my apartment get in my car to get some food from the store when I know I am not hungry. Even at work i grab some peanuts and fruit snacks just about every break. Also I am eating on lunch at work instead of smoking three or four cigarettes and drinking my big ass water. Its just food all the time, food food. Shit I had three meals today plus some chips, reese's, soda/juice, and I got up at noon, sat around on the computer all day. I didnt need one meal let alone 3+.

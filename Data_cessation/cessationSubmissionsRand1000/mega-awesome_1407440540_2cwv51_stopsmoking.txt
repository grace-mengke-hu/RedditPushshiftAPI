Almost thought I wasn't going to have any of these smoking dreams...

Until last night. I don't remember why I decided to have a smoke in my dream... But I remember I was hysterically upset about it. And it wasn't for myself that I was upset... I was upset because I knew I now had to tell all of you guys.

I just want to thank you all for being a constant rock. You get me like other people in my life don't. You get me through the hard times and I'm not sure I would have made is this far so far without you. <3

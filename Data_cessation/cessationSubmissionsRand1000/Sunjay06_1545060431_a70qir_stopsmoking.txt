Update-Holiday

Finally done with holidays with friends, involved lots of drinking yet did not even take a single puff. I believe the best way to stop the trigger/craving is to face them headS on and through experience. 

Yes it is difficult for the first couple of times but I believe we can all do this and stop the brainwashing thatâ€™s going on in our brain. Also help to be aware if itâ€™s a physical or psychological cravings. Mostly itâ€™s just our brain playing tricks on us. 

We can do this ðŸ’ª

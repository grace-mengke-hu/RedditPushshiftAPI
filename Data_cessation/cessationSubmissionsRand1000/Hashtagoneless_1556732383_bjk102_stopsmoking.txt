Having a hard time

I’ve had two non consecutive days of no smoking in the last three weeks. I have only a few patches left and yet I’m on my smoke break. Hoping this community will give me the strength I need to get this quit.

I’ve had nine months smoke free in the past and then had one crappy day, so I picked it up again. That was nine months ago.

I know I can do this because I’ve done it before but this time is really challenging. The cravings aren’t really the problem, I can get through those, it’s the irrational anger on days two through four that always drives me back. How have you all dealt with this?

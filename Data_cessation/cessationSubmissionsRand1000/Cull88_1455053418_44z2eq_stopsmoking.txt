It's 9pm and I just realised I didn't think about a cigarette until now!

Man, it feels great. I'm not one to brag but this has been a great experience, loved every minute of it. Honestly, I got to that point of hating cigs so much and after i relapsed last year, I know i'll never go back. If you really want it, giving up is so easy and so pleasant! Anyone thinking about quitting, do it. It really is so much better, in every way :)

7 days in, I'm so tired...

I'm on day 7 and the cravings and going strong (sort of?)  The cravings at the beginning of the week were fierce, especially when I was driving.  Things have been crazy and it has been one of the most stressful weeks I've had in a long time.  I keep telling myself that cigarettes are not going to do anything to cure that stress.

The one issue I am having is I can't sleep.  I know that can be a side effect, but ohmygod I'm tired.  I've been using the patch and trying to take it off an hour or so before I go to bed, but it hasn't helped much.  Anyone know how long this will last or have any tips to help?  I need to get some rest.

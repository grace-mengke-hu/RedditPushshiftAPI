day 26

its day 26 of no juuling coldturkey for me and im actually starting to feel like a human being again lol, for the past 25 days ive felt like a zombie or like a robot that wasnt connected to reality, but it feels like that feeling is pretty much over and is coming to an end, the only thing im struggling with the random bits of stress and anxiety that come and go but hopefully they will lessen with time

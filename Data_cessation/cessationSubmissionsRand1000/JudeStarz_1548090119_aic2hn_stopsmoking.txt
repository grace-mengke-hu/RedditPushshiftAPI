The truth is, nothing works...

Except for a lot of time, patience and a fucking strong will to make it. To make it to that day...that week, month and year, where you for once in your life as an ex-smoker DO NOT want, think, dream or crave a damn cigarette. 

I know I may sound very negative right now and I probably am because I am having a not so great gazillion time trying to quit. And for some reason, it seems the hardest this time around. Grrr...I hate cigarettes so much and I hate having to fight all the damn time...

Anyway, I am not saying it won't happen because I am very sure it WILL. because I was there once too. 

But you gotta hang in there. You gotta be damn strong. 

On another note, what do you guys think of Allen Carr's book? I see it recommended all the time and I've read if like 4 times but here I am again. üòÅ I guess he'd say it's because I didn't follow all his steps to a T... And maybe he's right but I'm not feeling him like a 100%, js. 

Anyway, good luck everyone and I'm sorry of I offended anyone in advance. I just needed to vent a little, no hard feelings I hope.

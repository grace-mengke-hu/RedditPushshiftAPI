I'm still trying.

But, I havent really put any work into it. I hate how my lungs and throat feel. I love the relaxation of the ritual habit.

My old record was 4 months... But after that was when I became a heavy smoker. I guess my current record is 12 hours.

How can I hate everything about smoking except the act of smoking? I understand and feel all of the side-affects, but they are all thrown aside when the craving kicks in.

I really need to set aside the time to follow the advice I've seen on this sub. I keep myself subscribed to it. The only thing I do when I take a smoke break at work is browse reddit on my phone. Every tenth post I see is someone's success story, how long they've made it without nicotine. It reminds me constantly. But for some reason, I can't picture me being the one to make that triumphant post.

I really cant figure out what it takes... Hopefully I'll remember what I put into this rant. I hope it echoes in my head. I just need those reminders.

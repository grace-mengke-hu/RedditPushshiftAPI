Day 8, I forgot to post yesterday, day 7 - which was my first goal.

Hey everyone!

I hope you all have a great non-smoking day. Currently I am on day 8. I was going to post at a week in, but I was too busy yesterday with friends to even notice. 

If you remember my post from before, I have already made it through so many triggers in this week, that usually would have broke me down.

Got into a fight on valentines day with the SO, and immediatly wanted to smoke but fought the urge and made it through. The following day continued feeling horrendous, and wanted to smoke, but also didnt.

I have since also been out drinking twice with friends of mine, who are smokers, I was offered a smoke and was glad to be able to say, "no thanks! I don't smoke."

Keep on going at it you guys!

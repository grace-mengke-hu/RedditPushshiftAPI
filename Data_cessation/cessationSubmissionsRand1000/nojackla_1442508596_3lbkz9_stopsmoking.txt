Just walked 2 1/2 miles and can't stop crying

because I'm so surprised and happy that I was able to do it. I'd never have been able to when I was smoking. Not without frequent stops, a couple of smoke breaks, and possibly passing out or throwing up.

Life is so much better, unimaginably better without cigarettes.

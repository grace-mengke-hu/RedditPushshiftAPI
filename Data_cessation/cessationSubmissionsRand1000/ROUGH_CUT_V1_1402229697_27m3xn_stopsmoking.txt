Relapse after 6 days

A fight with the missus sent me straight to the shop to buy smokes.  I was feeling good about my progress, and I was even coupling it with some better diet choices and exercises.  But that all went out the window for the last 3 days, so here we go again.  Reset the badge.  Start fresh.  Anyone else have relapses?  What does it for you?

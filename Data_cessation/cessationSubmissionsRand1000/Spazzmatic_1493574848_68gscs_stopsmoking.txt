I manage an anti-smoking website on Facebook, and recently I got a comment from 20-something female who denied that she was an addict. Gang, what do you tell someone who's in denial like that.

She responded to my assertions with "Actually no. It's because I want to. 
I have quit before, I know I can quit. I just don't want to quit. 
I started knowing it can kill me, and is an expensive habit. Knowing that it has been the cause of death for many people I know. And I didn't care. 
I like the taste, I like the smell, I like the feeling.
 I. Smoke. Because. I. Fucking. Want. To."

How do you get through to someone like this who can't face reality? Your comments, please?

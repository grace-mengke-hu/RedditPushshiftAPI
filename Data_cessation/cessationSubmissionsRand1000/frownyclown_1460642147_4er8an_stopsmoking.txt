Went for a bike ride yesterday...killed it!

I used to bike a lot, that was years and years ago. But it had gotten to the point when over the last couple of years, I'd get my bike out and ride it was just hard, painful, and tiring. Even a couple of days after I quit smoking I biked to the local post office, just a mile away, and it was hell. I hated it.

Well, yesterday I thought I'd go out again, just because exercise yo. It was fantastic! Everything about it was better. I could breath, I had some muscle strength, I actually caught my breath back after effort without stopping! 

That's just two weeks after quitting smoking (and drinking) so I am very pleased with the results and wanted to share!

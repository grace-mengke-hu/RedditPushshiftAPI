70 days free - started going to the gym today

Hey guys,

after I stopped doing sports (mainly playing football) because I couldn't enjoy it anymore as a smoker because my lungs used to burn, I started going to the gym today again and it is crazy how much my stamina (hope this is the right word, I mean the ability to run long distances) has increased by simply not smoking. My lungs do not burn as much anymore and I don't feel like I'm dying. I'm just feeling so, so much better physically and psychologically - please quit smoking if you're still on it, most of all for yourself!

Wish you all the best guys, we can do this!

awful situations, depression and still not smoking!

I got kicked off my course that I'm doing, simply for being assertive enough to raise my concerns about the quality of the teaching. 4 of us are in the same boat, but the whole class have raised concerns. Not once were we aggressive about it, I was really bloody diplomatic. I'm losing my mind at the moment with a number of situations (work stress, family fallouts, difficult time of year) and getting really depressed again. I haven't smoked but I do worry that if my mental health gets worse it'll seem like a valid option because I get self-destructive.

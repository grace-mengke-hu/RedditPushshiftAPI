I had a smoke last night, and another this morning. I feel like a failure.

So I wound up having a smoke last night, and then again this morning.

This is a lot harder than I anticipated.

I'm still looking forward to the upcoming long weekend, where I can stay home and deal with the cravings and irritability without annoying those around me.

I know I can do this, but I guess I didn't think it would be this tough. I am a very strong willed person, but going cold turkey is the hardest thing I've ever done. 

It's driving me crazy. I know I want to quit, and that this shitty habit is killing me, but my stupid brain just keeps throwing rationalizations at me. 

"Oh you can just have one, it won't hurt. You'll stop tomorrow." 

"Man, you're bored. You should go have a smoke." 

"You know what would go great with this beer? A smoke!"

My fucking brain sucks.

2 weeks free

I read Alan Carr's book and smoked my last cigarette two weeks ago today.  The book opened my eyes to what I was doing to myself and that made it much easier to quit.  I have had a few odd cravings but I just laugh at them.

I went out quite a few times last week and was hanging out with smokers without any problem, I even went outside with them a couple of times, standing right there when they were smoking and it had no effect on me.  I just pitied them.

Anyways, if you're reading this, it is possible to quit!  I did it, now it's your turn!

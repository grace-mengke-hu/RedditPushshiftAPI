Day 20!! & Yesterday was a test of my resolve...

Hey all, 

So yay day 20 and I am feeling much better then I did yesterday.  Yesterday was a day from hell that started with a 4 am wake up call from my three year old son who was done sleeping for the night.  Fast forward several hours and I ended up stuck in traffic on my day off, to go to a court appointment because of my job.  Longer story but I was not in trouble, had to testify to something I saw someone do.  

After an hour in bumper to bumper traffic I was furious, tired edgy and craving badly...even my patches could not keep up with my cravings.  From there I ended up sitting in criminal court for 4 hours(!!) only to have the guy I was testifying too plead guilty, and it was over in five minutes.  

QUE DRIVING, back to home only to have my wife upset at the over tired 3 year old who refuses to take a nap, and is freaking out over the smallest problems.  Toys won't play like he wants... he cries, lunch not what he wants...he cries.  Tried to put him in bed to take a nap....take a guess...yep he cries.  

By 4 pm I was exhausted and about two steps shy of heading to the gas station...but...instead I took the kid to the park, who feel asleep on the way over so I ended up driving around for an hour, just to keep him asleep.  

Hardest day by far, and there were times that I know I snapped at my wife and child because of a mix of cravings and exhaustion.  Treated them both to dinner and many apologizes.  

That all being said I feel much better today and have taken time to reflect on what was the big things that "set me off".  Stress...need to learn to deal with some stress..

TLDR: BAD DAY!

So tempted to just join in...

So like i mentioned on a previous post, i have started a new job where everyone on site drinks and smokes. 

Now the problem is that along with being addicted to the cigarettes i also highly enjoyed smoking. Especially after doing anything physical. The new job i do is highly physical building types of structures etc.

I am so tempted to go to the shop and buy 30g but i know i will instantly regret so i need help on the following; 

Does it ever calm down/stop these high urges?

This is the longest i have been without inhaling anything (not even vape) but should i start vaping again at 0mg to help with the work battles? 

I just dont want to be addicted to smoking/vaping anything long term...

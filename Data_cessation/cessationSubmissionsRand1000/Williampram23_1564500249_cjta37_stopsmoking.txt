I am now 3 months nicotine free

I did it. I managed to put down those cancer sticks for good. No nicotine replacements, just good old fashion cold turkey.

3 month-ers, do you ever have trouble controlling your anger when a situation occurs. I’ll give you an example, so my sisters tend to annoy me with what they say and when they keep on bitching about me I would go into the other room, have a cigarette and come back “resetted”. Now without cigarettes, in those kinds of situation I would be crabimg for something to reset my mood and after that comes me snapping at them. Litterally shouted at the top of my lungs at them to “shut the fuck up”. I don’t usually get those kinds of cravings with everything, but certain things that gets me frustrated I would immediately think of cigarettes.

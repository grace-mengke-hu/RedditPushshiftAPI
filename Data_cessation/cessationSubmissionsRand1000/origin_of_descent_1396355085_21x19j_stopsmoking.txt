One Week Complete...It's like saying goodbye to a bad friend

I just had to share... this is the first time in many years that I have gone for a week without a cigarette. My cravings are significantly lessened (the first three days were very difficult...there was a voice in my head practically screaming at me to walk to the convenience store). I notice I can breathe more easily, I run further than I ever have at the gym, and that god-awful stench no longer lingers. Everyone in this community has been extremely supportive, and I am very thankful. Even urging others on in their quitting journey has strengthened me. 

I came to the realization that quitting smoking is like saying goodbye to one of those friends who aren't good influences, who bring you down, who need to be out of your life. Recently I did that to a whole group of people I had grown up with. It  was difficult, but we didn't click any longer, and I knew that if I continued to hang with them I wouldn't be as successful as I could. So there were many lonely months, but you know what? I feel much better now. Between ditching people who used me and treated me as an afterthought, and quitting smoking, I really think my life has improved. I feel strong going forward. I feel like a changed person already.

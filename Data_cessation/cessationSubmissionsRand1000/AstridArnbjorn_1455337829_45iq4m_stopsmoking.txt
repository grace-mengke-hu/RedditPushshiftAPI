Someone brought up their husband not wanting to quit and it reminded me of something I recently wrote about a possible reason for my failure to quit.

This is what I wrote

"Today is my tenth day without smoking. I thought I’d feel much better by now, but the cravings are still there. My brain tells me in one moment I could do it one more time, maybe even just casually & just as I am about to give in, I remind myself I have to be strong, it will never be just once or casually. I know that to be true, I’ve been here before.

I wonder if it even makes a difference at this point. The damage is done. I enjoy it. I can usually afford it.  Is there a point in stopping? Is not smoking going to vastly improve my life?

I know if I go back it will cause more damage on top of what it’s already caused. Another concern is husband, my raison d’être, I hoped if I quit he will too. He’s worse than I am with it & I know better, he has to want quit & he doesn’t want to. If he’s going to put his life in danger, why shouldn’t I? If I lose him, I lose everything.

I don’t want to fail again. I don’t want to get to ten days & fail. I don’t want to deal with the withdrawal, it’s all psychological right now, but it still drives me mad. I can’t very well go over to my husband and tell him if he doesn’t stop I’m not going to stop. I also worry about my job, I’ve been pretty moody since I came back to work, I was out sick for the worst of it. I wonder if I am a better employee when I use. It’s so confusing."

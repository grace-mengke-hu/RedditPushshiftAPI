Checking in at 277 days!

Just wanted y'all to know that I went to a wedding this past weekend and people were smoking cigarettes all around me and I didn't have a single craving. In fact, it smelled awful.

That night I had a dream where people kept offering me cigarettes and even my dream self was like "uh, hell nah".

So just know that it really does get so much better! I never really think about smoking anymore, except in situations like the wedding which are few and far between.

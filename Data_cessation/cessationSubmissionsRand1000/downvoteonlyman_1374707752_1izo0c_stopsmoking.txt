The pressure of cold turkey and quitting

I have found that being completely stressed out about not smoking at all was even more detrimental to my quitting plan, than just allowing myself a setback. 

"Setback" is the most important part of that sentence. I have tried to quit before and as soon as I smoked just a single cigarette, I immediately felt like a failure and decided that I wasn't strong enough at that moment in time, and that I should try again in a few days, weeks, months, etc... 

What works for me, is simply realizing that quitting is quitting, regardless of how long it takes to be completely smoke free. If I have *one* cigarette while I'm out with my friends drinking, it's *okay*. It does not mean that I am a failure. It means I've had a small setback. I'm still quitting smoking, it's just a steady process.

All that being said, if you can cold turkey 100% and it works best for you, then props to you! 

I guess all I'm trying to say is that don't give up, even if you've let yourself down, you're **still** quitting!!

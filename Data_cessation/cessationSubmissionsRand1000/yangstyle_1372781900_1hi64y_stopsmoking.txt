Started taking Wellbutrin yesterday to quit smoking for good.

I decided I really must quit smoking and went to my doctor for help. A prescription for Chantix was written but my insurance company refused to cover it. And paying $250 for a month's supply was out of the question. So, it's Wellbutrin.

I had been reluctant to use this drug because it is an anti-depressant and I have never used one. I don't have a problem with depression.

So, how do I feel? Well, to be honest, I don't feel anything different mentally or physically. Of course, I have only taken it one day so maybe it needs to build up in my system. I don't know.

My doctor told me to keep smoking for 7 days after starting the medication. I anticipate my last cigarette EVER being this Sunday night. I am determined to not be a smoker any longer. 

Just needed to get that out there and declare my intentions to people who would know what I am going to go through. I have been lurking here for a while so thanks.

BTW, has anyone here quit with help from Wellbutrin?

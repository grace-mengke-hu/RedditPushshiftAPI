Not really here but wherever I am I'm Not Smoking

Not sure why I'm writing this, I've not craved today, sure I've had times in the day when smoking has been coming to mind but not wanting to smoke, no mood swings or addicted thoughts creeping up on me, nobody has pissed me off,  I'm still not sleeping great and dreams are still a bit mad but I'm feeling a bit lost couldn't really say down just feel like I'm not really here. 
3 weeks in is it just a case of in the words of Van Morrison,there'll be days like this

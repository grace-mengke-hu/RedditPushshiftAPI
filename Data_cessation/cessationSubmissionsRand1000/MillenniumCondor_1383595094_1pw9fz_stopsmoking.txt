Sixty hours smoke-free: checking in.

Hey everyone. Long time listener, first time caller. I've been smoking on and off for about ten years, ranging from a pack a day to a pack a week. Over the past two years it's been a fairly consistent 10 cigarettes per day. I've "quit" twice in the past, neither time lasting more than six months. There comes the delusion that one cigarette won't hurt, then before I know it I've fallen off the wagon.

Lately I've been getting tired of despising myself for wanting to quit but not quitting. I mean that despite all the reasons to quit and a fierce desire to stop, I would always find myself at the convenience store forking over the cash for a new pack and telling myself "this will be the last one." Maybe you know what I'm talking about.

Anyway, something snapped and tonight at midnight will mark 72 hours, 30 cigarettes not smoked, and $10 saved. I'm confident I can make it to that point, but it's the future I'm worried about.

Things that have worked so far:

* Keeping my mind busy (writing for National Novel Writing Month, and lurking on this subreddit)
* Staying active (running, martial arts)
* Holding a cinnamon stick in my mouth and fingers while driving (sounds silly but they are almost exactly the same shape as cigarettes)
* [Quitomzilla](http://www.quitometro.org/quitomzilla_en.php), an add-on for Firefox (I don't have a smartphone)
* Working feverishly on the NY Times crossword while my friends step out of the cafe to smoke together.
* Breathing through the intense cravings, which usually last no more than a few minutes

Things I am worried about or habits I must change:

* Smoking on the porch with my morning coffee and book
* Smoking before and after stressful shifts as a waiter and sushi-chef
* Going to the bar with friends (most of whom are smokers)
* The girl I am dating smokes a pack a day

There is no punchline to this post. I just wanted to introduce myself and tell you about my modest success and present doubts. Cheers.

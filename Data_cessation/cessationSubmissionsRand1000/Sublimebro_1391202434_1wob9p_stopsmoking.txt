How do I get past this anxiety? Is it normal?

In high school I was put on antidepressants for anxiety and depression for about a year. I got off of them my senior year because my anxiety "magically" disappeared. Anyways I'm 20 now and quitting smoking, but that social anxiety and generalized anxiety has come back out to play while I'm trying to quit.


It was so bad today, that when I pulled into the Walmart parking lot I had to turn around and drive 20 minutes back home because I was about to have an anxiety attack.


Is this part of the quitting process or has the nicotine been subduing my anxiety disorder for 3 years?

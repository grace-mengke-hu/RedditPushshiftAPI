Just had drinks for about 5 hours. Didn't smoke.

I just had dinner and drinks with a few professors and classmates, and I didn't smoke. That means I didn't need to take the elevator to get outside (multiple times), which would have been even harder because I'm on crutches. That also means that the cute girl I'm crushing on wasn't disgusted by my smell. That also means that I didn't make a bad impression on my professors.

In summary, not smoking felt a lot better than smoking, peak-of-withdrawal symptoms and alcohol be damned.

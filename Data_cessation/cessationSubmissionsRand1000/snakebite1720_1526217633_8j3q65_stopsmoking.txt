Smoked few drags probably not even a complete ciggrate

So here I am again. After been on patches for a week everything was going good. I stopped patches 3 days back as I felt I don't need them. Now today while having drinks with my brother I had few drags from his ciggrate. Am using smoke free app and I recorded this in it but am not resetting the quit date. Because it's not a relapse. 

To give a history I used to be a smoker for 12 years with am average of maximum 10 ciggrates a day. On my 11 day now with few drags as mentioned above.

Any piece of advice.  Feeling a bit of demotivated and angry that I did it. But determined that I won't again as I know now a new trigger point.

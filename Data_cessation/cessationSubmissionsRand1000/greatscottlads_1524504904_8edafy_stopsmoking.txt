Quitting Smoking Today After 5 Years..help!

So I started smoking in my 2nd year of Uni...I am 25 now, it has been 5 years since I started and I now work at a car dealership full time in sales, which I love. However, today is the day I told myself I would quit. I typically smoke about half a pack a day, though I love my job it really is such a habit to smoke at the dealership especially with such a fast paced environment so I am having a really hard time with the cravings. I know it is my first day and I am trying to enjoy living as a non-smoker but when those cravings hit I keep telling myself not to have one, but it feels so tempting I can hardly stand it, and it is making me appear noticeably moody around my coworkers. I feel like I will never get rid of these urges!! I just want to go back to being a non smoker, as I know smoking is ruining my looks and health. Please help!

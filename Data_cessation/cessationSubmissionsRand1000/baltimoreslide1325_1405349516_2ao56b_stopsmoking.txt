Pulled the trigger today. Never going to smoke again.

I posted a week or so ago about how I'd been hovering at 0 cigarettes to 1.5 cigarettes a day for 2 weeks (after 10 years at 7-10 a day, usually), and about wondering how to go from that to cutting smoking out for good. Well, today's the day. I've already been experiencing a taste of the non-addict life for the past weeks and it's all I want now.  
  
I really want to extend huge thanks to all the folks in this group. The stuff people write here has been absolutely key to my being able to finally brainwash (in the good way) myself into being ready for this. Good luck to everyone, especially to everyone else starting today!  
  
Yay I'm done!!!! God damn I'm so GLAD to be rid of it. For two weeks I've just been grossing myself out with this tiny amount of smoking and afraid to let go, but today I wasn't afraid anymore. :D

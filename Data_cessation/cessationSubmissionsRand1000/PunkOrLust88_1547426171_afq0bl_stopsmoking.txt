Here goes my millionth attempt...

As the title implies, I’m a serial quitter and relapser.  No matter how many days I go without smoking, a month being my longest stretch, I always end up giving into the cravings and starting right back at square one.   Giving it another go tomorrow in hopes I’ll have two smoke-free weeks under my belt for my 31st birthday on the 28th.   Losing hope and motivation, and I just don’t if I’m strong enough to truly do this, but I’m certainly going to keep trying.

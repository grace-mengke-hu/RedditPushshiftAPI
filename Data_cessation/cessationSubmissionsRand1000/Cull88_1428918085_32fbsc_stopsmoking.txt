Day 1 (again)

so today as of 10am i've had my last cig. Ive said that about 400 times in the past, but this time I feel determined and I really want to do it, but am I fully confident?, i dont know. It's always the same, i get to day 2/3 and I have a fag and feel shite about it. Having a drink is my biggest problem, thinking i'm gonna have to lay off the weekend beer for a while! Anyway, any tips or motivational comments would be appreicated, just dealing with getting past that day 3 hump for the first time! im going cold turkey too, because ive heard that it is the best way, because using NRT just prolongs the addiction. Also, E-cigs, i believe, are no good at all, i gave up 3 weeks with them and I was just chaining it, all day and it was getting harder and harder, not any easier at all!

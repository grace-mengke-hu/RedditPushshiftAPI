day 5 and sense of taste starting to return

Whoo hoo!! its Friday and 5 days a non smoker so I decided to celebrate with my favorite drink, a nice cold dark rum and coke. You know, I always wondered why everyone told me to make their drink weak, it's because I make my drinks really strong cause I could not taste them. I can sure taste them now!!! Anyhow, have a wonderful no smoking weekend. We can all do this!!!

I am now a non smoker!

Can I say that yet? I'm on week 3 of champix and today I just threw everything in my bin. I think this is it this time. I'm pretty excited and I don't think I would have tried Champix if I hadn't seen peoples success with it in here. Thanks for all your support so far! Fingers crossed but I think I got this!

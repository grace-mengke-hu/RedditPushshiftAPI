I can smell SO MUCH now

It's such an odd thing to even notice but it's one of the first things that came back to me, more noticeable than taste of food even. I have never noticed any great sense of smell in my life but now it seems I can't stop picking up even minute scents and I can definitely smell the lady three aisles over who bathed in her perfume. I also noticed that I don't love SUPER salty things anymore, it just tastes like overkill which is probably great for less water retention. 

What have you guys been noticing?

Day 60 Smoke Free - Ramped down on my patch from 21mg to 14mg...

Started smoking 35 years ago and I am very happy to be smoke free 60 days. Starting slow but finishing the race. I will be nicotine free by the end of the year. I have some much more energy and so much more time to improve my self. New found appreciation of who I am and who I want to be. Thanks Reditors for being here when I needed you!

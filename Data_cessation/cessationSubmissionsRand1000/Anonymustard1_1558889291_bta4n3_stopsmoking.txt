I'm fucking killin' it! One week of no alcohol and 3 days of no cigarettes.

Such a minor achievement, not even an achievement per se since most people never start with this problem, and instead consider an achievement as saving 5K or buying their first house or whatever. Nonetheless, I'm 29 y/o and been fucking up my life for a solid year and a half with alcohol but I am proud to say I'm one week sober and not looking back. My sleep has been god-tier, my diet and exercise zounds better, my skin even looks healthier. 

Day 1 off cigs I chewed a bunch of Trident gum, and played a fuckton of video games lol. Good luck boyo's. Oh, and this worked for me- hope you can try it too... I left all my money a day's transfer away, so I literally couldn't buy cigarettes if I wanted to. That way it was no longer a matter of willpower but just of means. Try it out if you can, big help.

Really want to do it this time

I have smoked for over 30 years. Have quit for a few days up to 3 weeks a few times. I can give you every excuse as to why it is not a good time to quit.
 Am disgusted with myself because everyone who knows me says what a strong woman I am yet I am afraid of quitting smoking! It is like leaving an abusive relationship, you know you have to go but are afraid of the unknown. I know this sounds stupid but I really want to do this and not screw up! How do I start?

Day 11 is almost done! When should I reward myself?

It's been difficult especially day 9 but this forum has been great. Despite it being hard it's still a lot easier than I mentally thought it would be after smoking for 9 years and not trying to quit for 2! I have been travelling Canada since Jan 15 I'm currently settled at a ski resort in BC. With all the travelling and smoking I was spending a lot of money so I don't have a lot but already noticing a difference with not smoking and my rent is $200 cheaper a month in summer. Anyway I have wanted a camera for a long long time a rebel t5 when should I reward myself with this gift? I have an app that tells me my money saved you guys think I should wait till mymoney saved is greater than the value of my treat?

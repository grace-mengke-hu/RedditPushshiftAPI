Hey guys. I'm going to quit smoking tomorrow! 

Hey, so the only way I can see myself actually doing it is If I vlog about it. I'm not talking just boring ass me talking to the camera it will be better than that I promise. If anyone wants to watch my en-devours I shall either update this post or make another post! But by the by, vlogging helps me to do things for some reason, I would encourage other people to do it to, it feels good to let all that crap out on a camera for some reason. Anyway, I'm gonna start filming the first part now and then the first day tomorrow and it should be up by the end of tuesday :D 
Also I wouldn't mind some advice if you've got any :)

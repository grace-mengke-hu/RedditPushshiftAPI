Day 6 complete

Having a craving that is still going on now. It's happening at the same time everyday. My mind is saying that smoking a cigarette will be awesome now. But I know it will probably last 10 minutes or so and then I have to live with the guilt, which is not worth it.

Question: What brings you pleasure? What can I do instead of smoking? Probably chew gum?

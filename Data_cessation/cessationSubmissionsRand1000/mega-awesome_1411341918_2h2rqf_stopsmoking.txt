#2 STAR!!!!

I can't believe I made it to 2 star day! Wow.. 60 days. I really never thought that I could go this long smoke free, I never thought being smoke free was an option for me..... it just feels so... good :)

Yesterday I started a new fitness routine (anyone here doing PIYO?) to get rid of those pesky pounds that came with quitting, and after 2 days of that I feel unstoppable :)

40 more days until I make my quit cake LOL

Thank you... all of you for being my rock(s)!!!

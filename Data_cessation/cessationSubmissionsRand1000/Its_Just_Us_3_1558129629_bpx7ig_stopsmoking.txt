More than 1 yucky habit !

I haven't had a smoke for 1month and 4 days now   and iv stopped biting my nails clean off too ... Everyone was right saying that anxiety comes directly from smoking ... I know it's not the only thing but Im so calm and relaxed about everything these days ! Im bever looking back on my old brainwashed life !!! I AM FREE !!!

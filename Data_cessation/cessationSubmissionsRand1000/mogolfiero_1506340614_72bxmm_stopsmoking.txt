3 weeks smoke free

You know what? Ive been smoke free for about 3 weeks now. Sometimes i miss it, i really do. I actually "enjoy" if a puff of another person might hit me across the face. But the duration of this is 10 seconds. The rest 86390 seconds of the day i feel just fine.

Had an event on Sunday as a volunteer. Rode around 30-40k on my bicycle and was super effective. 
Imagine having to stop every hour or so for a smoke. I would say those 30-40ks on my bike would have been 5 at most and I would have been dead at the end of the day.

Felt so great when we finished, I even enjoyed a Mojito on the way home.

It gets better, thats what ive been saying the whole time!

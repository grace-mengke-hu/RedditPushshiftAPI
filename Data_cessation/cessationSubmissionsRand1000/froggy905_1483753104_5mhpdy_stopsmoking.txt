2 weeks!

This is my third major quit attempt.  I quit for 7 weeks a year ago.. and for 5 or 6 weeks this fall...

I just hit 2 weeks again without a smoke.  I think this time I have to stick to "not even one more, ever"!!  In the past I have compromised for the drunken "1 will be ok".... and totally slipped back to smoking.  So this time I am going to try and stay strong.

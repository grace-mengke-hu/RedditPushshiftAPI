Day 15 craving

So I worked the second shift instead of the third today.  Everything was status qui.  Cravings feel like they are approaching a manageable level.  I am able to go much longer without actually feeling the desire for a cigarette and when it hits it is normally fairly fleeting.  With one exception.... as soon as I hit the lobby leaving work I get this overwhelming OMG I need a cigarette now craving. I may have to take the long way out of the building tomorrow to see if leaving from a different exit alleviate it a bit.  In the meantime I have unfortunately gained my sense of smell back.  While it is fairly pleasant to smell my coffee in the morning and things like that again, sharing a LYFT with a gentleman with body odor covered by aftershave is not making me enjoy this newfound sense as much. Wish me luck hope everyone had a good holiday!

Helpful Habits to Quit?

I really really want to quit. the longest ive gone was a day. ive vaped for a year, so im not looking to go back in that direction. i quit drinking easily. smoked cigarettes 3 years total. i really dont want to use a nicotine supplement to wane down. and i know im sounding picky and i know theres no overnight solution. anything helps and im open to any pointers.

thank you.

How I defeat "mad" cravings

The other times I quit I could not resist the  "mad"cravings, sometimes they even grew with time. This time they have been much more manageable because I am deeply convinced that nicotine does not help in any situation,  it is just an illusion of the addiction. I do not waste mental energy by evaluating whether cigs could render more manageable some circumstances or if I could afford just one "cheating" cig. As soon as a thought about smoking arises, I quickly dismiss it. I was always struck by the fact that when I had a bad bronchitis (or sore throat) I stopped smoking for days with negligible cravings and without will power. The reason was: smoking was not an option. Not another cig will land on my lips, no matter what. 
Nothing to miss, nothing to enjoy!

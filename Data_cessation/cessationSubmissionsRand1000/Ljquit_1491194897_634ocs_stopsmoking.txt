Getting there! But the cravings are worse on the weekends.

During the week I feel like I've got this, and I consider myself a non-smoker and am confident I'll never take another puff. But on weekends, the cravings seem relentless and I'm not sure I can resist them forever. I keep telling myself they'll have to give in soon, or I will. Why is that, do you think?

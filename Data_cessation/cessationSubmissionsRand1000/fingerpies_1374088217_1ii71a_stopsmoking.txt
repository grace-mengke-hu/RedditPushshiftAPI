Ok, r/stopsmoking, here's my deal...

I've been lurking around here to try and amp up some motivation to quit. 

Every single pack I wonder "should I make this one my last?"without ever making an actual plan.

Ok. So, next week I'm probably buying a new (used) car. I've always made fun of my friends who get a new car and try to say "no smoking in the car!" Because it never, ever lasts as a real rule. 

But now, I'm thinking about trying to make this a rule to help me cut down/ quit smoking. But I'm afraid of breaking the rule and feeling absolutely awful. 

Help me!?

Smoking my last cigarette

Hey everyone. I'm finishing up my last cigarette and I'm quitting in the morning. And no, I haven't been pushing off the date, nor will I. Today was my last day at a toxic job and I'm ready for a fresh start, tobacco free. The last few days I've been really mindful while I smoke and I've really noticed the taste, the burn, the dry mouth... 

I finished my last one as I typed this and I feel good. I feel ready. I didn't think I'd ever feel ready. Tomorrow is the first day of the rest of my life.

Here's to you, r/stopsmoking. I may need you in the weeks to come!

Not as strong as I hoped

I had almost made it 3 weeks, went to the bar and let myself bum a cig from a friend. I have now had 3 cigs since then. Guess I don't want it as bad as I thought. I know it's not the nicotine that gets me, it's the feeling of the smoke entering my lungs. I know its horrible but I missed it. Smh.

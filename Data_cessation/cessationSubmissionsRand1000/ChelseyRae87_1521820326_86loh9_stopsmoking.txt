Almost 3 weeks and it's time....

You guys are FANTASTIC with all of the positivity and support, but posting and commenting here has become my new crutch. Every time I'm struggling, i go to the app. I needed the support to get through week one, and then spent week 2 supporting others and sharing what has worked for me, and now it's time to just exist without smoking. Sometimes talking about it here makes me think about it more, and I want that to stop. 

I want to go out and enjoy the world without smoking, and figure out how to cope on my own. Feeling strong and on my guard. I'll check back in occasionally and see how everyone is doing and share my milestones, but i think I'm ready to face the world solo. 
Thank you for all of the support and love! I didn't even know reddit existed before SmokeFree suggested visiting this subreddit as one of the first few missions. I'm glad to have offered support and advice while accepting some for myself. You all rock and i will be sending good vibes your way. 

Stay strong. Stay focused. Prioritize yourself. You've got this! 

Adios.

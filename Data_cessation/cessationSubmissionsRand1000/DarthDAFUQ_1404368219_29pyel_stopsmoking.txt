I kinda wanna start smoking again?

I quit smoking last year early in December, made it through the holidays and I've been coasting since, lately though I've been having vivid dreams of me smoking, at first I'd wake up feeling regret and as if I had actually failed but lately I don't wake up during the dream and just kinda enjoy the cigarette exepting that I have to start over.. 

I quit because my first born was due in January so I kinda guilted myself into it. I really didn't have a hard time after the first 2 days and a silly fight with my wife. 

For now I'm questioning my reasoning for quitting also for wanting to start again after doing so well and knowing full well it's bad for my health and smells horrible I can't even make a proper argument as to what I want.. It's a bit frustrating. Is this normal?

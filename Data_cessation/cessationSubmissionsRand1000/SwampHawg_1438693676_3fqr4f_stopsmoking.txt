Day 1. Demons are tickling my trachea with a feather.

28 years, pack a day.  I don't have an overly addictive personality, except for nicotine, it was kinda custom-designed for me.  A chance to be alone in my own head, away from people...the best.  I didn't care when bars kicked me out to the sidewalk, I got to be alone in my own head, and that's where the party always is anyway.  

But now I'm 44, and I have to quit, or admit I am too weak to solve a problem that is likely killing me.

In the vein of 'It is easier to carry 2 buckets of water up a hill than 1', I'm starting a new workout program this morning to try to get a nice multiplier effect going on my new vector.

A rueful and scared shitless, Day 1.  Day motherfucking 1.

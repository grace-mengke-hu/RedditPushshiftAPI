More updates on stepping off patch

So 2 days after stepping off patch it was a little foggy, a little tired... Nothing I couldn't handle.

Yesterday and today (days 3 and 4)? Fuck this noise. After a rough day today, my brain tried to play the tricks on me again. "You can stop and get a pack on your way home, no one will know for just this one night." Yesterday my brain/body tried to go back to old habits - while working from home, I stepped away from my computer, put on my hoodie, and went to where my cigarettes used to sit. Luckily I had planned for this (first time I'd needed it in two months), and I had my play dough in that spot for some tactile therapy. 

WHAT. THEFUCK. It feels like weeks 2-3 again. I'm thinking about cigarettes 3-5 times a day, having to talk myself out of going back.

Talked myself out of it today, asking for help when I need it, but damn, I was not expecting this step to be this rough.

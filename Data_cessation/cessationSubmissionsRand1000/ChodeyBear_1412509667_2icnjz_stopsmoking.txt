What's your favourite bit of the Allen Carr book?

I'm feeling the need to refresh my memory at this point in my quit, and thought a bit of a list of the bits that really stand out might help me and others!

My favourite bit is where he describes the drug, devastation. 

DEVASTATION is an extract from a plant indigenous to South America and is the same genus as deadly nightshade. It is the most addictive drug known to mankind. Over 60% of adults become hooked. It is a powerful poison and is used commercially as an insecticide. It gradually breaks down the immune system, causes breathlessness and lethargy and, according to the latest medical statistics, kills one in two of those who are unfortunate enough to become addicted to it. It tastes foul and systematically destroys the nervous system, causing a feeling of insecurity and a lack of confidence. It currently costs the average UK addict around Â£100,000. What does it do for them?
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING !
Could I persuade you to try it? Of course not. Who would be that stupid?
If you were addicted to it and you knew of an easy, immediate, permanent and inexpensive cure, wouldn't you take advantage of it without hesitation? If your answer is no, then you've no need to doubt my sanity. On the contrary, start doubting your own. Can you believe that over 99% of the population of Western society has experimented with this drug and at one time over 90% of adult males were actually addicted to it?
The more discerning reader will already have deduced that DEVASTATION is the drug we know as nicotine.

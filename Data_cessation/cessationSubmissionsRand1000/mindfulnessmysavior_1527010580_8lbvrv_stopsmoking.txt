45 days ago I relapsed after staying nicotine free for 37 Days for some reasons. It took me 8 more days to realise that I was making excuses to feed my addicted brain. I had to choose life. So I did. A few minutes ago I completed total 37 days without nicotine.I do not miss cigarettes, I hate them.

Preparing for triggers tonight...

I'm going over to my folks for the first time since I've quit. My mom and I always catch up over a drink and a few cigarettes on the porch. She waits for me to have her first cigarette of the day when she knows I'm stopping by; almost as soon as I walk in the door she gives me a smooch and invites me out for a smoke. I don't think she thought I was serious about quitting, but I know she will be super supportive (and maybe a little jealous?) when I tell her I've been a non-smoker for a week. 

I'm just having a lot of anxiety about starting new rituals, etc. How have you guys adapted relationships that used to have smoking as a common ground? Sharing a cigarette with someone created this private space I'm going to miss. I suppose the solution is to just join her outside... without the cigarette.

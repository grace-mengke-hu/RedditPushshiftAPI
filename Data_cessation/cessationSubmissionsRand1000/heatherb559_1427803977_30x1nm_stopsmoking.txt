31 days in and my pants don't fit

Normally I am very conscious of what I eat. Do my best to be healthy, organic, and GMO free as possible. When I quit I gave myself a pass to eat anything I wanted with the exception of a donut. I have a physically demanding job and a hyper 80lb dog and a love of the outdoors. So I'm not concerned about my weight gain. I am feeling rather put out about this fat free chocolate milk this morning. It sucks. The oatmeal isn't quite as tasty as my usual sausage biscuit. I will survive. I know ... I should go eat my lettuce and shut up. So glad I'm a non smoker today!

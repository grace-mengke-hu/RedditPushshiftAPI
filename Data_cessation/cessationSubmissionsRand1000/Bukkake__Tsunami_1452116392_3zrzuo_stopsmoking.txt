Using this as a blog, sorry. Also, a rant.

* I hit my first milestone: since my last attempt to quit about 10 years ago, the longest I didn't smoke was during a heavy flu last year - 6 days. I hit the 7 day mark today, which means this is currently the longest time of not smoking for the last 10 years. Next record will be 10 weeks (2nd longest quitting duration, ~10 years ago).

* It's... not easy. Still isn't, probably won't be for a while. The roughest day was still day 3 or 4, so I guess I can't complain. I am not dangerously close to relapsing as I was that day though. Right now the cravings are very annoying, but not seriously dangerous. They still scare me though because one of them might cause me to relapse.

* The hardest part is coffee. I need coffee to function, no way around it. All my life, coffee went hand in hand with cigarettes. I am drinking coffee right now because I just started my night shift. And every sip comes with a craving.

* I'm trying to not tell anyone about my quitting, but it's not easy - especially when someone talks to me about smoking. In my experience, telling people of partial successes decreases my likelihood of reaching the end goal. Right now, only 2 people IRL know. I almost told a co-worker tonight after he made a comment, but managed to hold my tongue.

God, I fucking hate the grip cigarettes have on me and my life. I can't wait for it to be over. (The grip, not my life)

It's so fucking baffling that that shit's even legal. I mean come on, alcohol and other drugs at least make sense as an addiction (and I say that as an alcoholic who quit drinking and will never have a drink again) - it's an escape from reality and your problems for a few hours. Cigarettes are just all the bad parts of an addiction without a buzz. It feels like fraud, like a scam. You get nothing out of it, not even temporarily. All you do is feed the addiction.

It makes me so fucking angry.

Bad aspects of the quitting process aside, I'm secretly getting prouder of myself. I'm far from full-blown "omg, I made it"-mode, but these are results I haven't seen in 10 years.

Day 12 troubles

Well last night was a hard one. The guy I've been talking to told me I'm being needy and cut me off.

In fairness, the quitting smoking has left me with so much energy and spare time I'm not really surprised he feels that way. My hormones have been crazy- I'm generally a positive person, but the anger flare ups are frustrating. I probably have been too forward (but who says no to a cute girl wanting you to come over and "exercise"?) Guess next guy I talk to I'll need to chill out a bit. Anyone else have any issues like this? 

After that fight immediately I wanted a cig. Luckily there's no temptation on the house (and I'm super proud of myself and not willing to throw that away for some dude I barely know).

Oh well. I made it through the night (and the morning- the hardest part of the day for me). On to more internet dating, sans tobacco.

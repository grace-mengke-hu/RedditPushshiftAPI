Day 2

Hi /r stopsmoking,

I've been a smoker since my teen years.  Quit through pregnancies with no issues, it was easy to be honest, but I simply didn't have any other option in my mind.  I wasn't going to smoke with a helpless human in my body, I refused to force my unborn kid to smoke with me.  I picked it back up after pregnancy/breastfeeding was over with though.  I was in the military at the time, a mechanic, and it was just what we did.  We smoked.  A lot.  All the time. I want to be done forever.  I AM done. I don't enjoy it...I never really have enjoyed it.  I'm smarter than cigarettes.  It had gotten to the point where I'd be self loathing every time I'd light up.  I knew I needed to do something.  So here I am.

I stopped 2 days ago.  It's pretty horrible right now, using every trick in the book to keep my mind occupied and keep myself busy.

My husband is a smoker and currently has no desire to quit.  So there's a challenge there, but not one I haven't faced in previous quits.  

I feel pretty crappy right now.  I'm moody, cravings are pretty terrible, and time seems to be moving SO slowly. The little voice in my head is screaming that I can do this, that I will do this.  I need a punching bag and a large bar of chocolate - I'd feel better, I think. :)

Just wanted to drop a post and say HI! And good luck to everyone else attempting another day smoke-free!

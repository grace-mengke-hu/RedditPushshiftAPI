Positive benefits

Approaching my one year anniversary and it's been a long while since I posted anything on here but this week I had to do a lot of running through airports to make a train and cannot believe I made it. No burning sensations in the lungs or anything. I really feel like I've turned a corner. Also completely nailed going out and drinking with smokers. Feeling quietly confident and proud of myself. really think I've succeeded this time and cannot tell you how great it feels. :-)

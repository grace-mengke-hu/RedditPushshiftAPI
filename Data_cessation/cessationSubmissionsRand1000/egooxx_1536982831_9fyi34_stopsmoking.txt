i've smoked after being 1,5 months of being smokefree - should i reset my counter? (drunk)

(not a native speaker)

so... i've quit smoking 1,5 months ago. i was doing pretty well.
today, we had a school feast - i go to evening school. 
i've gone there with my boyfriend and our best friend and we all wanted this evening to be a great one (we haven't been out for a long time). 
however, we had a terrible night. a couple we were with had a big fight and my boyfriend and our best friend have done their stint. 
we all separated and i just got home; my boyfriend's already asleep. 

my question now is: should i reset my counter? 
i've smoked on my way home, but i know i'll never do it again. i realized that it didn't help me at all and that no matter how bad my situation is, i'll never try to solve it by smoking again. 

what do you guys think?

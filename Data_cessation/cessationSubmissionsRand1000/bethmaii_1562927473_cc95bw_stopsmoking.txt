Caved last night, but it made me realize that I wanted to do this even more

So I haven't had a cigarette in nearly 2 weeks now, but I went out with a friend last night and asked for a drag of her cigarette. I wasn't planning on buying a pack or smoking a full one, but I just wanted to see if it was as good as I thought it was. 

It was genuinely the most disgusting taste - how the helldid I do this for 5 years? How did I suck on that 6 or 7 times a day? And that's just from one drag. 

So yes, I caved and broke my 'streak' - but if anything this just reaffirmed why I was doing this in the first place.

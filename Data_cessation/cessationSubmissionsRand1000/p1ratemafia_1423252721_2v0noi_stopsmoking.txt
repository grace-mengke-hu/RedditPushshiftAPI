The Damn Dreams

Every night.  I dream about smoking a cigarette.  I barely have any cravings during the day, but every night, I dream I smoke a cigarette.  Then I "wake up" and think that I actually smoked one because I found a pack in my bed.  Then I actually wake up and realize it was all a crazy-ass inception-styled dream.  

Every night for the past two weeks.  I wake up pissed off and frustrated.  So then I go for a run and celebrate in my clearing lungs.  Fuck you Cancer Sticks, get out of my head.

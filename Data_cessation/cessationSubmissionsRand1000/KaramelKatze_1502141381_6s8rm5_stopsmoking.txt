Finally going to try...

Hey all!



Ive finally decided to bite the bullet and quit. I wanted to almost a year ago when I moved to the east coast because of how expensive cigarettes are where I live. I never got around to it for some reason, I guess I didn't have the guts to do it, or the motivation, or the willpower... whatever the case may be. 



In addition to that, I started seeing a guy extremely casually about a month ago. Recently, things have gotten more serious, and we had a serious conversation where he told me smoking was a big issue. I want to be clear... I am NOT quitting because he doesn't like that I smoke. I'm quitting because one, I want to, and two, I've never had smoking affect my romantic life until now, and I am just 100% NOT okay with that. 



Anyway, I bought 40 packs of Wrigleys gum of Amazon, they'll be here Wednesday. And for the time being, I am going to buy a couple packs to get me through until them. I'm quitting at the very end of this pack. I have three left. 



I haven't tried to quit since 2011, and I've been smoking regularly since 2009. I am very VERY scared of what the withdrawal symptoms will be like. My mom, who quit smoking 12/28/1998 told me that all you have to do is make it one hour. Then another. And then another.



Wish me luck, god knows I'm going to need it.

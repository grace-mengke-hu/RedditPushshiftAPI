Be patient with yourself

When we quit smoking, sometimes it feels like those old cravings from our daily routines are *never* gonna go away, right? I know I sometimes feel frustrated that they are still there,  especially the instantaneous ones, like right upon waking, or right after a meal.

I try to remmeber to be patient with myself. I smoked for nearly 14.5 years, or about 5000 days. That's 5,000 mornings that I woke up and smoked; that's 15,000 meals that I smoked after; thousands and thousands of cravings that I always satiated with a smoke!

 **Our brains can't permanently unlearn and undo these many thousands of cravings in just a matter of days!** It will take time, a long time -- I smoked for a very long time, and so I should expect that these cravings will linger on as well. 

So be patient with yourself. Every craving you endure brings you one step closer to a retrained brain.

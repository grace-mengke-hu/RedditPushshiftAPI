Smoker since 2010, 2/3 through Allen Carr's book.

I started smoking in high school at 18 after a breakup with a girlfriend. 

People shouldn't be forced into making life changing decisions like where to go to college at 17 or 18 years old. 

People shouldn't be allowed to make life altering decisions like to pick up a life long habit disguised as a pleasurable social device on a whim when someone has a pack in their car. 

To infringe on our freedoms would be to infringe upon our very liberty, however, and I'm glad to live in a country where I'm allowed to make whatever decisions I please. I only regret that I was so careless back then in so many ways. 

I'm currently reading Allen Carr's easy way to stop smoking, and I have to say the first half although repetitive was really a good wake up call. 

The thing I keep running over though is how he says "no smoker really enjoys it" or "they taste awful" or "we had to work at it to become smokers and get through that first nasty cigarette"

For me, it wasn't like that. For me, my first cigarette was a high I'd never experienced, a taste I swore was delicate, and my first month smoking I had a sense of "wow, this is why so many people smoke." I felt like I understood and could relate with smokers and viewed non smokers as a lesser group who were missing out. I truly believed it. 

I'm not sure at what point in my life I finally realized I was a drug addict and no one envied me like I thought they did, but here I am on willful quit attempt number two. Wish me luck, and good luck to all you others trying to quit.

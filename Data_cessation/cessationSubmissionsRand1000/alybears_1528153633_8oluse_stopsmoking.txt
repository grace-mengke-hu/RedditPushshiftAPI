Today has been one of my worst days since I’ve quit.

I am coming here to vent because I am getting so enraged every 5 seconds today and I am soooooo annoyed.
I work in a gas station and have had so many insufferable customers. Partly because I have terrible brain fog today I just can’t get my shit together and ugh. 
Currently sitting outside with a vape and a Red Bull trying to put on a happy face so I can get through the next 3 hours here without catching a charge. 
I’ll be ok I just needed to vent.

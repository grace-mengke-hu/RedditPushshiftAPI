My Stop Smoking Plan

So i've tried quitting cold turkey before, and it hasn't worked at all. My new plan is to slowly cut smoking out of certain situations 1 at a time, until i don't have the urge to smoke at all (at least hopefully), my plan is this (so far)

1)I've stopped smoking in my car, so far it's cut me down to about half the amount i usually smoke in a day, as this is where i was smoking the most and figured it was the best place to start

2) stop smoking at work: i was going out on every single break before, so i'm gonna slowly wittle down how much i'm smoking. 1st i'm gonna do 1 during my 6 hour shifts and 2 during my 8 hour ones (my hours have been cut for a month or two, so the 6 hour ones are more frequent than the 8 hour ones), until i don't have to actively stop myself from smoking on the breaks i've said i won't, then i'm gonna cut it out altogether on the 6 hours and go to one on my lunch break on the 8's, then cut it out altogether for both

3)stop smoking while drinking/at shows: i go out to the bar/ local music shows a lot, playing in 3 bands this happens fairly frequently but not on a daily basis, i'm still working on a plan to cut this out so any advice would be helpful

4)stop smoking before bed: i have to work on going to sleep without having a smoke right before, another one i'm working on now

5)stop smoking in the morning: once i get used to sleeping without smoking, i'm gonna get used to getting up without one

once i get rid of all of these triggers, i think i'll be at a point where i can cut it out entirely, although i might still need to slowly phase it out. Has anyone else had a system like this to quit? was it successful? i've never had much success at this so any advice would be helpful

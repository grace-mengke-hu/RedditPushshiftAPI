OK. For those with smoking dreams. I just had one at 7 months, 5 days.

At least it was only a dream (though it felt so real in the dream, that I woke up feeling super guilty, to the point that I was wondering if I had been out in my sleep, which apparently wasn't the case).

So, for anybody wondering about smoking dreams -- it's real!  Don't cave when you wake up!

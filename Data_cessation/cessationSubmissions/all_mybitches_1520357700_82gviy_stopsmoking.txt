I started smoking when I was 12. I'm 30 now. I just hit the 13h mark which is the longest I've voluntarily gone without nicotine in 18 years.

I just wanted to share since I'm keeping it from most people I know for now. This is weird. I'm doing alright but a couple of cravings were pretty bad. And I'm already irritable. And why the hell do I randomly want to cry sometimes? Twice now I've wanted to cry. That's the weirdest part of all of this for me. 

Anyway. I'm going to keep at it. I mean, I came this far already...

Edit: as I mentioned to a couple of you I caved and had a few hauls off of my e-cig when I got home. Felt incredibly guilty at first but I'm not considering that a failure though - just a minor set back which is still better than buying a pack. Thank you so much for all your comments, I read and will continue to read every single one and they're making me feel a lot better. Just need to try a little harder tomorrow is all, but it already feels like it'll be easier considering how many routines I broke today.

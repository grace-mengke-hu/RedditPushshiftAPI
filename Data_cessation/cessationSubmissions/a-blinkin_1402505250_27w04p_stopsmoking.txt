Day Six here. Did anyone else think it's really easy to quit?

I smoked a pack a day for about 6 years. Last Wednesday, on a whim,  I watched the Allen Carr documentary, threw out my remaining cigarettes, and went to bed.  I was expecting to have non-stop cravings for days on end.  The first day I had maybe 4 cravings.  The rest of the time, I get maybe one craving a day.  

Am I some sort of exception? This has been ridiculously easy.

I just smoked my last cigarette.

This is it. I’m finally doing it, cold turkey, no looking back. I’ve been smoking for 10 years (am 23 now, started at 13.) 

I’m a little anxious for obvious reasons. I’m hoping someone can give me some tips or advice, maybe some insight on what I should expect in the coming days.

I have a chronic skin condition that has been being fueled by my smoking, this is something I need to do, no excuses. I’ve been putting it off forever, I just want to feel healthy!

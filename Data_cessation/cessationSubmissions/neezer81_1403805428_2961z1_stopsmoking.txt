Please help me.

I went to the doctor a week and a half ago.  I told her that I was ready and I want to quit smoking.  She tried to give me Chantix, but I told her no because of the immediate cost, so she gave me Welbutrin.  I've tried the cut back a few every day thing she told me to do.  I still smoke. It's not doing a thing for me.  I want to quit.  I want to quit so bad.  What do I do? What works?

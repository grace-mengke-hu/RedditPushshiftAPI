A YEAR

Holy shit you guys, I did it!   Still the same old story as six months... be strong, it gets easier, stop drinking for a while if that's your big trigger, keep looking at that badge, exercise, and most importantly, *use every tool in your arsenal* if you have to.  If that means gum, chew gum, if that means vape, go vape.  But read Allen Carr, post to this sub, do the time and be strong.  It gets easier!!!

I must say that the one different factor in this quit vs. all the other ones I've attempted over the years has been this subreddit.  I really don't know if it would have been possible without the many daily small reminders and support of the good people here.  When my friends tell me they're trying to quit this is the first place I send them.  I couldn't have made it this far without you, thank you!

2 Year cravings

Hey Guys, My name is Fearofpandas and I’m an addict!

It’s been a while since I’ve lighted my last cigarette at 00:31 April 19 2012. 

Since then I’ve been through a spiral of feelings, cravings and issues, but most of all I’ve earned  a LOT! 

I quitted cold turkey, with a predated moment. 

Days 3 and 63 we’re awful. Days 5, 30, 90, 100, 365 and 730 were absolutely awesome!

Recently I’ve been going through a very awkward and strange phase. I’ve been reminiscing. 

Often after a meal the following though is back and forward in my mind: ‘Do you remember that great, awesome, splendid feeling of lighting a cigarette after a big meal?! Go buy a pack!’

I’m a junkie and I know for sure that If I smoke one cig, I’ll be smoking a pack and a half as I used to. So, to my junkie self I say: HELL NO!

Thank you for your time and support. You guys are great!

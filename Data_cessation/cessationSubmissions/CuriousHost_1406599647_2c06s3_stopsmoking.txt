Music, emotion and smoking.

Hi all! Hope everyone's having a nice evening. I'm closing in on the end of day ten and feeling pretty alright. I was just relaxing with videogames and I got a snip of a song stuck in my head, a song that was tugging at my heartstrings. So I listened to a little of the album and I felt all kindsa of feelings. Immediately following their arrival is the memory of "Savoring" the moment with a smoke. 

Enjoying music, and I guess having an emotion triggered by a song or piece, has always had a strong tie to having a smoke for me. When it came up this time, it seemed so natural I began to miss smoking for a second and undo some of the conviction I've built up. The thought "how can I enjoy this or feel this and NOT have a cigarette" entered my head. It felt as if it were impossible to imagine. Laid out here, and through the lens of my recent acceptance that cigarettes did nothing magical for me, the thought seems absolutely illogical and bizarre. But the ability to enjoy an emotion or song without a smoke is not one that seems natural to me after years of indulging that impulse...

Does this make sense to anyone? Anyone else get this? It seems so.. Odd.. Right now.

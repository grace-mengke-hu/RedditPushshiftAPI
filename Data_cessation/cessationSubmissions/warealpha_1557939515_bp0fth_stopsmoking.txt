Started smoking and vaping at the ripe old age of 13, (already had asthma then) I’m now 19 and I’m paying the price with lowered lung capacity and coughing both keeping me up at night and keeping me from exercise. Today is the day I draw the line and put my own health &amp; happiness before my cravings!

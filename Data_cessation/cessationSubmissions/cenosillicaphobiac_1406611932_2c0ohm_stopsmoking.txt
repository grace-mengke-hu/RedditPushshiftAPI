My wife listens to my babble!

I've alluded to it in others posts, but when I came home today from work, my wife had taken her lunch break to go get me balloons.  Normally I hate her balloons and think they are frivolous, but the fact that she listened when I told her what a motivation the badge system has been for me the last couple of weeks and that I was finally getting my star, she got me some [gold star balloons](http://imgur.com/CQ3tWHy) to celebrate.

She quit in anticipation of getting pregnant and I initially tried to quit then as well, and then again when he was born, but she never once gave me any shit (well, when she was pregnant and upset she did one time tell me it wasn't fair, but it was only once, and she was fucking pregnant!).

Quitting Cigarettes - Not as hard as you think (read if you wish, no compulsion)

The nicotine stick (cigarette) feels amazing doesn't it? When the nicotine slowly moves in to your blood and brain giving a purpose to take more of it through an **illusion** your own subconscious mind creates just to refill the addiction.

Reminds me of a man who was going through stress and lit one nicotine stick, then I asked now is your stress and problem gone? He said I think so.. Then I asked what made you stressed? He said my wife is asking for a divorce. Then I said wow so lighting the cig right here with me caused your wife to change her mind? He said well atleast I'm smoking lol. See the **illusions** his brain created to give him An excuse to light another to fulfill the nicotine monster inside him.

It's scientifically proven that nicotine and heroin has the same rate of addiction, just that nicotine is legal while heroin is not.. In UK heroin kills about 100 people per year, while nicotine kills more than 120,000 a year (according to Allen Carr). This is a slow form of a legal way to commit suicide.

#For those who say I know a friend or relative who smoked all his life yet lived till 90, this is a rare case and that's why your even highlighting this person.. Because only 20% of smokers die due to a non smoking cause... The rest die to a smoke related disease.

#Also those who say well, people die anyway I can even die while crossing the road from an accident.. Well your right people die anyway, but let's say the chances are for you to die while crossing the road was 1 out of 10.. By deciding to smoke you simply added another chance to die making the chance 2 or 3 out of ten now.

Good news is Quitting is ez and within few days or weeks your body will flush the nicotine monster out and the brain will get used to a better sense of what's going around, if anyone need help on how to quit feel free to contact me.

For those of you who think, it’s hard to quit think again and read this carefully

We all know that Earth takes about 24 hours or 1440 minutes to complete a rotation, so we collectively accept 24 hours or 1140 minutes as a full day. Generally, a regular smoker smokes about 10 cigarettes per day and roughly takes about 2-3 minutes to finish one cigarette. So we can assume that an average regular smoker spends about 20 minutes (10 cig per day x 2 minutes per one cig) per day smoking. 
Some of you’ll are wandering what’s with all these boring mathematics? Well hold your nerves and continue the reading because it only gets better from now on.
From the numbers we found, it’s now a fact that an average smoker actually smokes for only 20 minutes per day which is about 1.5% out of a full day. In other words, an average smoker is actually a non-smoker for 98.5% of the day.
So what?

Well think critically now, you are already a 98.5% non-smoker than a 1.5% smoker. Now why do you think it’s so hard to overcome an addiction that is as tiny as 1.5% of your day? Think again brothers and sisters because you already have the ability to stay smoke free for most part of your life, so why the big fuss to kick the tiny 1.5%?
Today is the day, let’s make a change (no compulsion just a humble request)


**Questions and Answers (updated)**

* Q. you don't "smoke nicotine", you smoke tobacco that has nicotine, what do you mean by smoking nicotine sticks?
A. You got it wrong, you intake both and it's the nicotine which causes addiction,reason I did not highlight tobacco is because it's not the real cause of addiction.. This is why when some people quit smoking doctors give them nicotine gum (not tobacco gum).

* Q. how can you help? You got any nicotine gum?
A. I smoked for 8 years brother, I can give you a book written by a guy who smoked 100 cigs per day for 40 years and quit in oneday which led him to write the book, you should understand the real problem is not death (pack itself give warning for that) but real problem is the addiction. nicotine gum is just rubbish (it's like curing an addiction with the addiction itself). Solution is in mind and understanding it's only an illusion

* Q. E-cigarettes is a possible solution these days, no?
A. No it's a new concept, would take about 60 years till results come out of it, in 1960s even doctors were in camel cig ads.. But only after decades it was accepted as a bad thing.Solution lies in our mind.

* Q but withdrawal symptoms can be serious after smoking?
A. No, withdrawal symptoms are very temporary, not worthy of creating a new addiction to cover an old ( like I said nicotine gum is like giving a drug addict the same drug in a different form as solution).. it's all in our mind, il give you an example:
Think of a guy who want to smoke a cig every single hour, if you ask him is it possible to not smoke for an hour he will say no way.. But if that same person has something important like a 12 hour flight or a 4 hour exam he will somehow stay without smoking won't he?
Solution lies in our mind I have a book that will clear this method of quitting

* Q. Is a smoker some kind of a filthy loser?
A. No, Don't judge people, smokers are brave that's why we had the guts to light one regardless of the warning in the box, this same bravery can be used for better purpose in life than smoking

* Q. What book do you recommend?
A. "Allen carr's easyway to stop smoking"
also i highly recommend non smokers also to read this, because we all know family members/friends/loved ones who need guidance and this would give you the knowledge to help them quit

Is it supposed to be so easy?

I know I'm probably getting way ahead of myself but I've found cessation surprisingly easy so far. I was expecting the first few days to be hell but I've been feeling just fine. I smoked 10-25 cigarettes a day for a little over 10 years and this is my first attempt to quit. I am a 27 year old female.

Don't get me wrong, I find myself thinking about cigarettes almost constantly but I haven't experienced any anxiety. The only physical symptom I have noticed so far is just a little fatigue. I have become irrationally angry at little things maybe a handful of times but I generally keep myself in check.

It's hard to put into words what it is like to quit smoking for me. It is a vague feeling of looking forward to doing something once I complete such and such task, and then realizing that I am looking forward to smoking. Then I just say to myself, "No, I don't do that anymore" and move on with my life.

I expected the cravings to be excruciating but so far they seem to be just a thought that pops into my head every twenty minutes or so but I just shoo it away. Quitting smoking cigarettes seems to be similar to a breakup with a boyfriend.

I also seem to have been slightly more motivated and productive. I went running tonight for the first time in ages. I am still wheezing but am looking forward to it getting easier and easier. I haven't been exercising regularly in years so hopefully working out 5 times a week will prevent me from gaining weight.

Just wanted to share my thoughts from day 3!

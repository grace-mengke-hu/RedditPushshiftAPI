It's been 2 months since my last cigarette, I'm amazed how much better I feel

Instead of my prior morning ritual of waking up and coughing and wheezing my lungs out before I walk outside to smoke another, I wake up feeling clearheaded and peaceful.  I can run again without feeling like I'm gonna cough up a lung and I no longer reek of smoke everywhere I go.  It's just mind blowing to me how I took the simple ability to breath comfortably for granted, and after smoking a pack every three days for 7 months, I'm starting to really feel normal again.

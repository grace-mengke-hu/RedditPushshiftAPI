Help me help my husband quit!

Hello! My husband has smoked cigarettes for almost 20 years (he's 33 and started in his early teens) and decided that today would be the day that he finally quits, cold turkey. We made some preparations over the weekend, like buying toothpicks and nicorette and other stuff like that, but I'm just curious if any of you successful quitters have any advice you'd like to throw my way. I want to be as supportive and helpful as possible without being overbearing or annoying. If there are specific things that your partner did to help you, or that you'd want someone to do, please let me know! Similarly, if there are certain things I should avoid at all costs, I'd like to know those as well. I'm very proud of him for making this decision and I want to do whatever is in my power to help him see it through. 

Thanks!!

Will having one ruin it all?

I quit once before as i was hospitalised for 3 weeks so all the hard work was done for me... this time around not so easy.

I had my last smoke Sunday morning (now late tuesday afternoon) I have no quit smoking aids as I'm super broke.
I've failed all previous times Ive tried to go Cold turkey as I end up having horrific mini break downs. Ive ended up in the foetal position sobbing uncontrollably after punching walls and cupboards, Incredibly humiliating behaviour.

So here I am a few days in. Wasnt exactly a choice to quit. I woke up sunday feeling sick, thought it was the result of a epic hang over... Turns out Pneumonia, except this time No hospital required.

Ive seen many quit stories of people cutting back/stepping down and was wondering if having one would set me back in the Craving cycle?

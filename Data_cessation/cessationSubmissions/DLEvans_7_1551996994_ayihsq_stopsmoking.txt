Help! Any advice/tips will be greatly appreciated

I quit smoking 12/27/18. Did 10 weeks on the patch smoke free. When I finished step 3, I kept having the thought I want a cigarette with intense urges. Yesterday I gave in and smoked a roll up, and woke up and bought a pack. I feel like I broke the habit of it but not the addiction per se. My life is also a mess due to 16 years of this addiction. In that 2 month span I started eating healthy and exercising, plus I felt so much better. I don't know why I smoked yesterday, that's what im trying to figure out. Why I couldn't keep going forward making progress. I live with a smoker that won't quit with me so it's kind of challenging. Any thoughts, advice would help. I've been lurking here a while and thought I really needed to post. I have no social support in my quit, and thought I could do it alone. Anything to get me back on track...

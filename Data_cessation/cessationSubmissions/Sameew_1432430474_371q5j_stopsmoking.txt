2 months free

Funny thing is, I don't even know what is the exact date that marks the 2 months, I know it was maybe a week before my birthday the day I had my last cigarrette but I'm not sure what day it was, I just stopped and never looked back.  
I'm really proud and hope to never go back, the craving is almost gone and I have an e-cig without nicotine for the anxiety if needed (but for some reason, since the craving stopped, I don't feel like using the e-cig either).  
It's possible to quit! I never thought it was possible and I'm really happy (I smoked for nearly 7 years, started at 15 and stopped days before turning 22)

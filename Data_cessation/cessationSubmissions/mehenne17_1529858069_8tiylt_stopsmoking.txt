Juul Habit

I am very interested in juul habits, or e-cigarettes in general. I am a student seeking information to help young adults with smoking cessation. 

I'm curious, why do many teenagers/young adults become addicted to juuls? Do you think they know the health effects of e-cigarettes? Do you think teenagers/young adults want to quit e-cigarette use? Why is quitting so difficult? 

Thanks everyone for your help! It is much appreciated!

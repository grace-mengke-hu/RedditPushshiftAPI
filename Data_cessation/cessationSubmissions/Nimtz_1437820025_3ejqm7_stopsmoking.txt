Quiting today after piking up smoking again last december.

I stopped smoking around 4 years ago, untill last december it was going really well. 
I found my best friend after she tried to commit suicide, she is suffering from anxiety attacks and borderline. The next couple of months felt like a constant fight to get here the care she needed. 

The smoking helped me with the stress and made me feel better, now that i know she is getting treatment, i can focus more energy in quiting smoking.
I'm glad this subreddit excist to help me motivate and thanks for reading my story! 
So the remaining cigaretes are in the trashcan and im quiting!

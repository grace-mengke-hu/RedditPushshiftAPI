Quitting at 25

Hey guys,
It's been one month and 1/2 that I've stopped smoking. So far I'm doing good only craving one very rarely. I used to smoke 1/2 a pack a day for 7 years.
I was wondering about health regain. I've seen a lot of things about what can happen when you stop at 35, 40 or later but how about at 25? Does it make a big difference or not so much?

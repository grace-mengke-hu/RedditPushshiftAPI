NRT - High!?!?!

Last night I got lots of sleep, went to bed at about 7.30 and listened to a pod cast. Did this because I haven't been sleeping well on NRT/ Quitting cigarettes.  
Anyway, just got out of bed, its 8.30, Sipping my coffee while my fresh nicotine patch leaks into my body. 

I'm on reddit laughing my ass off at at shit probably isn't LOL funny - I feel high as fuck!? like coke or almost microdose acid high? this is great but .. . normal? 

Is it just because I'm well rested. Or is this what normal people feel like when they sleep well?

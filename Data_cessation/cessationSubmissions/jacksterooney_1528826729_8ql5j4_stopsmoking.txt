How long should I wait until I drink alcohol again?

Hi, day 3-er here, though this is by far not my first attempt.

This weekend, my father is bringing the family to the coast, and I'm sure there will be drinks on the table, both metaphorically and literally. That would be on day 6 and 7 - for sure too early to even touch alcohol, especially since my brother and father smoke.

How long did you wait until you trusted yourself to drink again?

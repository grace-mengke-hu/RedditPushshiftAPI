Does anyone have advice for quitting vaping?

It'll be 2 years in May since I quit smoking, but I can't stop vaping now. I knew it wasn't a good way to quit but I did it anyway and here we are. I quit for 2 weeks by then I caved and bought another one. I haven't been using it nearly as much, but I don't want to be tied to it anymore!

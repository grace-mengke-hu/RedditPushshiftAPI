Reset my badge.

I'm bummed, but I'm also kind of excited. I had picked the habit back up a while ago, didn't change my number, and was sort of lying to myself. "Oh, I don't smoke anymore! See look I made this badge!"

Wrong. I've been a smoker and its time to change that. In my mind, the most important part of quitting is being honest with yourself. So maybe I'll stop lying to me, and maybe I'll really quit. Nah, you know what? I really will quit. We can all do this :)

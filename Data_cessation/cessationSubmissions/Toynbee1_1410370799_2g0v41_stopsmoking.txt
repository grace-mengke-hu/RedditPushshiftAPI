Day Six, and tempted to buy a nicotine-free vape. Bad idea?

I know a lot of people here consider having switched to vaping the same as quitting, but I don't see it that way. I don't want to be told that it's fine to be addicted to nicotine so long as I vape it, or buy a tank through your buyer's club or anything. For those that have given up nicotine completely, would it be a mistake to buy a vape with nicotine free oil?

I just want to drive down a long road in the rain and listen to Neko Case really loud, with a car full of smoke. Has anyone found the sort of romantic, asthetic desires for smoking replaceable, or am I just walking myself back to nicotine again?

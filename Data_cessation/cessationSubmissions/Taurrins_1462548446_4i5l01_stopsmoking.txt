Nicotine Withdrawl

Hey guys. So after 3 years of chain smoking a pack and a half every single day and my recent bout of Health scares, I have finally decided to quit smoking. I smoked my last cigarette 13 hours ago and I ripped up the last of my cigarettes after that. The hardest part is that I am already experiencing withdrawal symptoms. I am extremely nauseous.. so nauseous I can't even eat, I feel anxious, and the craving is driving me insane. Any tips from people who were chain smokers and quit?

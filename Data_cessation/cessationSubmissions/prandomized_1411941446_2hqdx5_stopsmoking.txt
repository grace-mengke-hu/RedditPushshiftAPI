Quit two weeks ago. Need urgent advice to stay smoke-free.

Hi all,
I've been a fairly active member of reddit (r/minimalism) a few years ago, but lack of time meant that I had to force myself out of here and remove my account. But here I am again, because I know, that reddit will definitely help me with this issue that I am unable to find a solution to. 

So I've been smoking for 5 years and two weeks ago I've decided that it's time to stop. These two weeks were the longest period of time I've been smoke-free. And it feels great. But there's a massive "but" (no puns here). 

I'm a creative person. I need inspiration. I'm running a business that relies on creativity (product design and 3D CGI). And now that I gave up smoking, I feel that completely uninspired. Uninterested. Unmotivated. Lazy. And I know why - during my smoking breaks I used to think, plan and generate ideas. Once I quit, I'm not able to relax on my breaks in that way any more. I tried drinking tea, eating apples, meditating... Nothing works. I just can't zone out any more...

So my question for all you people with experience in this - what do I do? Because I'm really tempted to jump back on the leaf just to get the creative part of my life sorted again. 

Any tips, what do you do on your short breaks? What should I do to "zone out"? Help!

Many thanks.

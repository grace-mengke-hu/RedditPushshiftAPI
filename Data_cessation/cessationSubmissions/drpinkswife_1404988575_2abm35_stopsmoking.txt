Anyone Else?!

Yesterday it was like I'd smoked an entire pack of cigarettes in a small room. That was the smell up my nose. It made my eyes water. I blamed it on my clean uniform, which when I took it off, didn't smell. I blamed it on the messenger bag that I carried yesterday, which was my husband's, but after sniffing that like a blood hound, didn't seem to be the culprit either. I wasn't around smokers. Not one. It began as I walked to work and stayed with me all day, maybe I sweat a bit on the walk? No matter how many times I washed my face it came back. Today I'm not wearing any makeup, just moisturiser and i'm going to carry a purse that I bought after I quit smoking. So, far, so good, but I've only been out of the bath for 20 mins. Has anyone else had this sort of thing happen? What am I smelling? Is my body still detoxing after 19 days?!

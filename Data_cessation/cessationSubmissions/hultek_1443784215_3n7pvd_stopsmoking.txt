My thoughts:

* It's actually fairly easy and enjoyable, at least for me - with right mindset
* You get to actually TASTE things and it's easier to say how food tastes (when I was smoking, I knew only 2 levels of taste: "OK" and "too spicy")
* I eat. A lot. Combine that with gym and that's actually amazing
* I smell other smokers and they smell HORRIBLY - as a smoker I had no clue, but holy fuck, when they sit near you at bus or at work after smoking... just gross.
* No coughing
* Less snoring
* My voice sounds better, no sore throat
* No need to poo every few hours (that was frustrating, to be honest)
* Saved lots of money!

Only con I see is:

* 

Yep, there are no cons of not smoking. ;)

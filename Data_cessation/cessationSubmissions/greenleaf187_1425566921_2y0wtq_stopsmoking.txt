What do you guys think of hubbly bubbly (shisha)?

I really hope no one here takes offense in this post. 

Does anyone here smoke hubbly bubbly? (Where I come from it's called shisha). I know it's part of smoking, and I never intend to go back to smoking cigarettes. But how bad is it to smoke shisha once a month or so? Just socially perhaps.

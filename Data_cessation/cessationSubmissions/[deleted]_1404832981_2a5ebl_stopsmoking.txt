Surprising.

I can not believe how easily it has been going for me. Over a year trying to quit with no success. Every time I was a complete asshole, a miserable loser slaving for tar and carbon monoxide. I tried different methods (cutting back, vapes, cold turkey, etc.) and I failed each time. I'm glad I finally read Carr's book. I'm glad that book helped me realize the the main problem (at least for me) was the brainwashing. That never occurred to me. It was the brainwashing and the addiction that kept me down. I smoked my last cigarette 23 days ago, as far as I'm concerned I'm fearless and free. If I can do it, if Carr could do it then you can too. Keep fighting.

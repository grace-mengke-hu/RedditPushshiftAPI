Champix opinions?

Failed to quit smoking countless times. Have been smoking 15-20 cigarettes a day for the past 7 years and always cave hard. Quitting seems to make me extremely sad to the point of sobbing on the floor and it's always too much and I just go straight back to it. Thinking of starting a course of Champix on Thursday.

Panicking :(

I smoked roughly 1 cig per week (rolled cigarettes mostly) during the last two years due to peer pressure mostly. Stopping now completely without any problems. But I am panicking that my lungs are already damaged and that its too late. I am 18 years old. Should I get my lungs checked? I dont have any symptoms

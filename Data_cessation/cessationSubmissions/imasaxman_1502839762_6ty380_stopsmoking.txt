32 days and didn't notice

Today when I checked my quit smoking app, I realized I had passed a full month yesterday. The thing is, I still dont feel proud. I can honestly say I haven't bought a pack of cigarettes since July 4th of this year, and I am very proud of that. However, for a week after the fourth, I continued to buy Black and Milds and would bum cigarettes off of friends. July 11th I thought, "I know this is cheating. If I want to quit there should be no bumming or sharing". And that was that. I reset my quit date, and didn't smoke anything but weed for 3 weeks.

I felt great. I was able to wake up earlier, I didn't smell as bad, I was saving money, and best of all I gradually was able to resist the urge to smoke to once or twice a day. I had my coworkers, clerks at the gas station, friends, and family all supporting me along the way. Then a week ago, after a night of heavy drinking, I bought another Black and Mild.

"It's not a cigaraette," I said. "I can have one for the busy weekend ahead, and then that's it." I should have stopped myself that day because I've bought one everyday since. I feel so guilty, and my friends won't let me forget that any kind of nicotine is cheating, regardless of the situation.

I don't want to reset my quit date. I've come so far and I don't want to feel like all of that was for nothing. I know I can do it, but it's so hard not to cheat. This is the first time I've written a post on here after lurking for quite some time. I'm still not sure if I'm writing this for myself or if I'm trying justify my behavior by asking. Either way I can't continue to smoke, but there's a lot driving me to right now.

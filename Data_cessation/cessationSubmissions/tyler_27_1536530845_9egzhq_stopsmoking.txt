The smoking spouse

Hi all, I've been with my wife coming up 6 years. We are married and have one child together. Recently within the last 3 months she started having the occasional cigarette with friends while out having a drink. She knows I'm against the idea of smoking as my mum died of cancer, but now I find her hiding cigarettes and spending alot each week on cigarettes. She must be smoking two packets a week easy. I've approached her on the subject but she simply gets angry and shuts the conversation down. I cant stand the smell and the deceit of the situation. Its impacting on our intimacy and placing a lot of strain on our marriage. What to do? Anyone been in a similar situation? Cheers

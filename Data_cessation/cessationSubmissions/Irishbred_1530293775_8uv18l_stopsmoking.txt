5 days in....

So,  I have been a big smoker and drinker for 20+ years.  This is my 2nd attempt to quit in the last month. So far i am 5 days in, no smoking and no drinking. I started walking a hell of a lot, and in the last 2 days i have started jogging, first time in 25 years!! Managed to jog over 1.5 miles yesterday and today. My key so far is just keep moving!! This weekend will be a HUGE test, can i have a few beers and resist the temptation to smoke, i am afraid to have a beer and not sure i will, it's what got me last time. Hopefully I can post back in a few days with good news...

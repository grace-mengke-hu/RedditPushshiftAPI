Just smoked my last cig.

I had weened myself down to only smoking a half, third, or fourth of an american spirit at a time, which got me from smoking between five and eight cigarettes a day down to between two and three a day.  Just now I had one cigarette left and decided it would be easier to quit if I don't have any left tomorrow, so I smoked the whole cigarette and almost vomited. Hopefully that feeling will deter me from wanting another one for a long time. Anyway, just wanted to share. Wish us ~~luck~~ strength!

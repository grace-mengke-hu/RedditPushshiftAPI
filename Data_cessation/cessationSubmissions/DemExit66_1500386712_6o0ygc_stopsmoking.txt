Day 3 - woke up feeling great

Not sure what's worse, the detox from alcohol or quitting smoking. Had a beer yesterday to take the edge off and I really wanted to smoke. I stayed strong. 

Walked into the corner store where I usually bought smokes, bought cranberry juice instead - article on whyquit mentions it helps draw nicotine out of your system which decreases withdrawal duration. 

Tonight I have to go across town which will be a huge trigger - have a smoke while I wait for the Uber, have one when I get out of the Uber was the usual routine - Be around other smokers. 

Been locked up in my own home since Saturday morning and it's time to face the world.

Back at it -- a week in.

This is the second time I've quit (First time lasted 2.5 months). I'm a week in and feeling both great and also trying to remember why I quit. It seems my biggest issue is that I truly ENJOYED smoking and the ritual that went with stepping outside for a min. I am working on getting past it though and finding things that are better now that I haven't had a cigarette in a week. Making no promises but going to do my best!

100 days!!

I just got home from vacation, and decided to check my flair. I had lost track of the days, and saw my triple digits! It's a great feeling! 

And it was SOOOO nice being on a road trip and not having to stop every 100 miles to light up! I was able to breathe at 8,000 ft elevations without a problem, walk a mile through a mine, go up and down hills without getting winded...

100 days ago, none of that would have been possible. To all those out there struggling, just starting out, or just looking for some encouragement, try to keep thinking of everything you'll be gaining by continuing to move forward! Every day is a breath of fresh air you can be proud of!

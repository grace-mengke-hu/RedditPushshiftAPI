I need help and motivation

I understand it's a mind over matter thing. I have rapid cycling bi polar so I swing moods on the daily. I am currently 22 years old and I've been smoking for 4 years a pack a day I have tried numerous tactics but the best that has worked the longest (3 weeks) is quiting cold turkey. I feel like a slave and I need this to end please give advice.. Thank you for reading

What did you substitute smoking with?

OK, it's been all of 1.5 days and I've been fine all day at work (I have an active job where I'm on my feet all the time), but sitting on my laptop at home, I'm obsessing, because this is the time I'd normally be smoking at. 

I'm the type who smoked "as a break". As in, really looked forward to rewarding myself for X task with a nice sit-down and a tea/coffee and a smoke. But now, there's nothing to differentiate taking a break from working. There is also the issue of what to do with my hands. I constantly need them to be occupied, even watching a film if I'm not smoking I'm playing spider solitaire on my phone just to occupy my hands. The monotony of spider solitaire almost drives me mad but I also need something that is similarly mindless yet occupying. I'm grinding my teeth and picking my scalp like crazy right now (I know, gross), when does this phase end?!

Edit: Don't know if it matters but for context I've been smoking 10 years since age 15. I've never been a heavy smoker, I seem to max out at about 8 a day, after that I don't get any enjoyment from them til the next day.

Edit 2: I guess it's also worth noting that I quit smoking weed 2 days before quitting cigarettes, after ~3 years of smoking weed every single day. So I suppose that'll be contributing to my anxious/tense feelings.

Stoptober

In my country we now have a campaign called stoptober. I wanted to quit for quite some time now, but always keep pushing the date forwards. Not anymore, had my last sigaret last night!

I've been smoking since is was 16 or so, and now I'm in my early 30's. Basically I have been smoking the bigger part of my life.

I smoke a lot, about 1,5 - 2 packs a day! It's starting to affect my health. Every morning I wake up, I spend the first 10 minutes coughing out my longs. If that ain't a sign things are going down hill...

The strangest thing is that for a long time now, I don't like to smoke, but I still do it. If I look at my future, I see no place for smoking. I don't want to continu with destroying myself, but at the same time that scares me, never a sigaret again?

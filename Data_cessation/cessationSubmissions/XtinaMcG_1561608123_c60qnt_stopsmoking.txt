11 Days and 23 hours ....

My friend came over today because she wanted a cigarette. I told her I’m still not smoking but she assured me she had her (for a change.) 

Maybe tempting myself wasn’t the smartest option because I’m only 11 days into my second attempt but I didn’t cave or have one single urge. I have to say this time (so far anyways) I haven’t had any cravings not even when I get agitated. 

I’m pretty proud of myself and I hope the success continues!

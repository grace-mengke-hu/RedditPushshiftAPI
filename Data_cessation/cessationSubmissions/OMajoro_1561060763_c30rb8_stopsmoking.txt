Relapsed into smoking after over a year

Smoked for about 3-4 months about a year ago. Family didn’t approve so I quit. Now after over a year(most of which i studied abroad having plenty of chances to smoke) I relapsed 2 weeks after coming back. I assume I don’t have the nicotine addiction, more of a mental thing. So kinda wanted advice on how to stop the cravings when I am around people who smoke.
(Most of my friends smoke and I also love the smell of cigs, so usually when passing by a random person smoking I get cravings)

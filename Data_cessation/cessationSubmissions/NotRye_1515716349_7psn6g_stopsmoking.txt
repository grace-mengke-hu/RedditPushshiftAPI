After 8 months, it's nice to have a badge again.

I had quit for over 2 years, but I started up again in May.  All it took was asking a roommate for one, and then my landlord.  Next thing you know I'm going to the gas station before work to buy packs and whatnot.  

It then took 8 months for me to be able to successfully quit, thanks to the AC video that may or may not still be on Youtube (I've had it saved to my laptop since the first time I quit.  

Anyway, just wanted to write about my 1 week milestone.  In order to celebrate, I bought Doritos and a Crispy Crunch chocolate bar.

Have a nice night, y'all.

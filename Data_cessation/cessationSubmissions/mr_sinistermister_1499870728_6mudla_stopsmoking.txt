How can i avoid relapse? I hate the self-defeating behaviour relapsing had on me

I have decided to quit smoking. I am 21, been smoking since 13. My best buds smoke too, but they are not up for quitting. i wanna be able to quit smoking without having to leave my friends. I have read blogs about quitting smoking and it all seemed like its very hard, but i've made up my mind and i really really wanna stop this time completely! Like not a single ciggerette from now onwards. But I am afraid of disappointing myself by relapsing. I'll appreciate any advice you have for me! 

Ps: i tried quitting a year ago but couldnt and after that i sorta believed that i am too weak to quit so i never tried again until today.

I really need help guys. I don't know if I can do this.

Well I finally snapped today. I was hacking up a lung earlier I could actually taste five years of smoking come up in phlegm. I can't do this anymore. I know this is going to sound bad, but I'm seventeen and I've been smoking since I was twelve. I want to quit so badly, but I dont even know where to start. I've made it one day without a cigarette and I feel sick as a dog. I need some support here, none of my friends honestly believe I can quit because i've tried so many times. I'm constantly surrounded by smokers, and my parents are convinced i'm not going to live into my thirties. I'm not here looking for sympathy, but I am looking for some help. Any advice would be really apprecciated.

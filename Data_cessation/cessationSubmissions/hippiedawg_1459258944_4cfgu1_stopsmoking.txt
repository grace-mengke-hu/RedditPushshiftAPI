Woop woop 11 months. The thing I keep remembering to not smoke.

I can't believe it's already 11 months smoke free. Thanks so much to this sub. The physical withdrawal the first three days was the most all-consuming difficult. Breaking the mental habit took  longer, and still is happening. Most of the time I don't even think about smoking, but sometimes i get hit with big cravings. I just tell myself "it will get better. it will go away." Because it will, it's inevitable. Wait out those tough times, and the next time won't be as tough, and you know you can do it. Hang in there!

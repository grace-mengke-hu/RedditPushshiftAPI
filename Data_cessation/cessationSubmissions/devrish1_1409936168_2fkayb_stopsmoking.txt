anyone else can't help but smoke when drinking

The first 6 months of non-smoking I avoided drinking which definitely helped me get through the addiction.  Nowadays, when I get a drink in me, I always need one and it doesn't help that literally ALL my friends are smokers who are willing to give me one when I ask. 

Anyone else manage to only smoke only when drinking and how long has it been since you "quit"

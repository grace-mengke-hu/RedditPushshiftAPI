3 days going...need support!

Hi there! 25/f been smoking 10 cigs -1 pack daily for 3 years (late bloomer I know) I tried doing the patch, the gum... Went to see my Pdoc and he prescribed wellbutrin 150 xl. Today is day 6 on the meds. I smoked till day 3 and it just felt weird. Haven't smoked since but I feel tension internally and it won't let up...is this withdrawal? Cravings? I really don't know... I'm a psychotherapist and help others w/ substance abuse... I can't ask clients to do something I myself would not do. I'm just having trouble identifying what this feeling is within myself.

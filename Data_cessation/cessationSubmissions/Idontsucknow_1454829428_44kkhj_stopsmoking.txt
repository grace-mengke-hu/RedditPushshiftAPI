I want to cry...

...both for good reasons and bad reasons.

Good: I DID A WHOLE MONTH!!! Yay me!!! I've even had beers 3 times this month, and didn't cave, including last night when a buddy was around who also smokes a lot. I will admit I thought the smoke smelled nice, but I didn't want to smoke!

Bad: I just read something that makes me want to weep for the poor kid who wrote it...I was googling to get back to this sub, and discovered reddit has pro-smoking subs. I'll never bash anyone for smoking, or there being such a sub, but it was so heartbreaking to read this (if quoting isn't allowed, I will respectfully remove this, don't want to break any rules):

> I started smoking last week and am still looking for my own brand, have bummed cigarettes from friends so far but am ready to buy my first pack but can't make up my mind, do know that menthols are not for me. Any suggestions?

Doesn't this just break your heart? I wish I could go and grab all these kids and snap them out of it, I wish I could prevent them from the damage I have suffered. I thought about PMing the person, but decided against it because it's not my right and it would be judgy, but I did wish I could warn them that they don't know the pain they're going to get. It just speaks volumes to me about the evils of this drug, and how glad I am to be rid of it. 

Stay quit, everybody, PLEASE. And if you ever get a chance to be a good example to some poor dumb kid, please do it. I'm going to practice what I would say, but I don't know what it would be yet. Something about what JOY it is not to smoke anymore, I think.

Happy quitting everyone, be brave and don't cave!

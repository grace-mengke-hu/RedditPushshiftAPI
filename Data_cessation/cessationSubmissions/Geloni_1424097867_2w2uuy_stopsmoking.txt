I cracked after 3 weeks

I've smoked for 10 years. Everything I do involves smoking in one way or another. I'm sure you all can sympathize with that. And the job that I have, you can't get away from cigarettes. It's ingrained in the culture. Three weeks I made it. Three weeks of misery for nothing. The intensity of the cravings subsided, but i just couldn't shake this constant manic feeling. Always on edge. I was miserable, and in my mind I felt like it would never end. After three weeks of being nicotine free the worst of it was over, and I still felt out of my body. Like something was missing. 

So I said hello to an old friend. Just once. Hah. Right. There's no such thing as that. So now I'm back where I started. Only this time with less confidence and more shame. But in my mind I know I can do this if I take it one day at a time. I just don't want to live the rest of my life feeling out of my skin. I dread learning how to socialize without smoking. I honestly don't think I'll ever be able to drink again, or at least not for a very long time. I don't know where I'm going with this, I'm just frustrated...

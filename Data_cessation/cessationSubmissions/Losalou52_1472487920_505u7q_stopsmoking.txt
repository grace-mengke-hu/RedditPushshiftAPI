1 year in the books! you can do it too.

I just had to admit to myself that I am a nicotine addict.  I will never be "cured" from that addiction so there can be no slip up.  I will never smoke again because of that.  

I don't have all of these tremendous benefits like smell or taste improvement, I don't snore less, I don't feel considerably different, but I KNOW that I am healthier.  You just have to decide and then be resolute about that decision for every day to come.

Make it happen!

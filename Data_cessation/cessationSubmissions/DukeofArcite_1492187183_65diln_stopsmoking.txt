Tips from my hypnotist

not sure if anyone else has used hypnosis to quit before...but here are some tips to fight cravings that I've found pretty useful: 

DON'T ARGUE WITH THE NICOTINE BULLY
1. Rename the urge ( I call it a motherf***ing a**hole)
2. Take 3-5 deep breathes
3. Repeat "I can live without it!"
4. Touch two fingers together to anchor the thought
5. Drink a glass of water instead of reaching for food
6. Think about your shiny toy (mine is better sexual performance and energy to exercise)

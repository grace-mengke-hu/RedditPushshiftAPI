Digestive System on Strike

Hello fellow ex-smokers,

Only day two, however feeling great! Well, apart from my digestive system, which seem to have gone on strike, aka, feeling quite constipated, which is usual for me. 

Anyone had this before, and if so how long did it last for?

A minor bump in the road, but looking forward to been back at business as usual!

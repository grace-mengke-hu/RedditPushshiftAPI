We all feel like it's a part of our identity right?

I am a re-smoker. I quit with my wife for \~6 months and then started up again from some social "pressures" where I tricked myself into smoking again.

Now I'm back in the loop of thinking that I can't be a person without cigarettes because I started before I was a teenager.

I have tons of arguments against smoking, but I'm looking for another to help me put them down again.

Need to quit by 2/16

I'm starting a job in a call center on February 16, and they don't allow smoke breaks. I've been smoking about over half a pack a day for over a year now (not long after I turned 18). I need to be able to work a 6-8 hour shift without heading out to smoke, where as currently that is 4 separate breaks of 2 cigs each. Also, the girl I've been chatting up has asthma and won't be around me if I'm smoking.

This isn't my first attempt, and the longest I've made it before is cutting down to 2 cigarettes a day for a month or 4 days with no smoking.

I have motivation this time and am hopeful for some better results.

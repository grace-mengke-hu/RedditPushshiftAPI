Day 2 crankiness

I'm (m24) only on day 2 but everything has been setting me off.  Luckily my co-workers are badass and they goof off and play along with it.  My parents (I've been a pos most of my life and this is step 4 In getting my life on track) however haven't.   I've gotten into 3 fights with them already.  My mom picked me up from work (suspended license, POS remember) and she smoked 3 cigarettes on the 30 minute drive home.  She new I was quitting and at first I was pissed, then it hit me, that it wasn't spiteful, I'm just being cranky.  That fact thought is so empowering.  I am so sick of being controlled by anything.  Even if it's just the need to light up a smoke.  Not anymore.  Just wanted to share with you guys.  I go to this subreddit when I get cravings and it helps keep me motivated.  Hopefully I can help motivate someone else.

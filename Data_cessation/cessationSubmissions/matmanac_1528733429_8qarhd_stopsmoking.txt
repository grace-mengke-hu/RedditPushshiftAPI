When did you stop coughing up phlegm?

When I was smoking every morning in the shower I would usually have a nice coughing session. I’m about two weeks in no smoking and I’m still coughing up phlegm in the mornings not nearly as much or as often. Just wondering what some of your experiences have been with this and other parts of recovery in your body you noticed.

Tossed my pack out my window while driving

I was driving on my way back home from the store, just had my fourth cigarette in the past hour, and out of no where i tossed my pack out the window, didn't even think about it. I just did it, like a reflex. I'm done smoking, I've said this a thousand times, but it's getting in the way of so many things. Smoke break during homework? every hour. When I drive to the store and another on the way home? every single time. After practice? you bet. Here's the kicker, I'm only eighteen and I smoke a pack in two days. Every time I do this, I get a day closer, last time I hit day 6. I've got the lowest dosage of patches and gum, and no time to smoke in the next week. Let's do this! Time to quit for good!

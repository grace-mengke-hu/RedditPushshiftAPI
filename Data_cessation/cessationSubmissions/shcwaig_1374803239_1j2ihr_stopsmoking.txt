Overdue Day 1

Today, I left my Counseling Resources class for my DUI/DWI from back in January of this year. One gentleman from the class has been through a lot of classes and spoke out to a great deal about addiction to anything. For the past two years, I've been going through a mind over body struggle about kicking my pack+ a day habit, and it's been to no avail.. Hearing his insight and wisdom on his experience with addictions and getting rid of addiction, it struck a deep chord in me. 

When the class was over, I got into the Jeep and cruised around a little and contemplated my addiction to Nicotine and Alcohol, and decided that enough was fucking enough! My life has been changing a great deal since March, and so does my addiction. As i drove around I knew this would be my last pack. I drove around for an hour chain smoking what was left in my pack in hopes that it would make me sick and leave a bad memory in my mind and body. Looking back that may have been extremely stupid but it's too late for that now.

Anyway, it's all uphill from here and for once I'll be less and less out of breath as I ascend.

I appreciate you all taking the time to read this lengthy text, and I wish you other /r/ stopsmoking quitters continued success!!

Cheers

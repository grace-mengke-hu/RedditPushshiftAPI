I thought this would get easier...

After twenty plus years, I quit smoking two weeks ago.  The nicotine withdrawal was bad but nothing I couldn't take.  

It's the psychological addiction I can't get over.  I don't have a problem most of the day, but come nightfall and it goes downhill. It starts on the car ride home from work. I get sad when I realize I don't smoke anymore. I'm so much more tearful and my temper is now like a toddler. 

I keep busy, cleaned out all my junk cupboards and closets. Took kids out. But nothing helps. 

On a sad note my family hasn't even noticed I quit. My daughter was bugging me to stop almost ever time I lit up. I would have thought she would have been the first to notice. 

When does the craziness stop?

Advice!

I've seen some posts about "any advice for not smoking when I {insert time you used to enjoy smoking}?" So I thought I'd share something that has helped me for when I'm driving or enjoying adult beverages. I got this Tangle Toy and it is seriously helpful. It keeps my hands occupied and it is just something to do that's not smoking. Hope this can help someone else too!

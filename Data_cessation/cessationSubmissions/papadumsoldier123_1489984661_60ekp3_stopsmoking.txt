11 days.

Its been 11 days since i last bought a cigarette (you can buy loose in my country)
I havn't smoked a full cigarette since. I only took 1 puff off a friend and instantly handed it over regretting that decision instantly.

Is it bad that i did that? Does it count as 11 days clean or did that dose of tobacco start the count over again?

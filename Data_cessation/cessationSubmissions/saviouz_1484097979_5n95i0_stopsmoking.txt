6 months in, over 10kg weight gain

Hello everyone, I'm almost making it to the 6 months mark and I'm very proud and determined to never smoke again. I almost never look back on it. 
However I feel very uncomfortable about the way I have been eating since then. I always have been struggling with overeating and dieting, and lately I am falling back to my worst behaviour. So far I have gained more than 10kg and I still can't manage how much I eat.
I feel like I have substituted an addiction with another stronger addiction.
I even have thought that "I was better off when I was smoking" but I simply disregarded the thought as false, I am apathetic about starting smoking again.
I want to be free of all addictions, but it's seems like I always need something else to get addicted to, for some sort of emotional and stress relief. I don't know what I am to do, do you have any advice if you have gone through something similar?

Tomorrow is day one. Again.

I've been on this sub either lurking or making posts and comments here and there for a few months. I was previously deployed and trying to quit. I had some good moments and bad moments. Fast forward to today and I am back home and still smoking. It has been hard for me to quit lately. But something happened tonight that made me really think and I've decided to hop back on the wagon.

I'm an American living in England, and when I use my card to pay for something, I have to sign a receipt. So I went to the local store to get a pack of smokes, and the cashier rang me up. I paid and then she said jokingly with no relation to smoking, "Just sign your life away on this receipt."

I stood for a moment and said, "That's literally what I'm doing. I need to quit." This time though, it wasn't just words that came out of my mouth. I felt it. I was literally signing my life away to twenty cigarettes. One of which could be the one that ends my life. She said, "That's motivation." She's right and it felt good to see her on my side. Exactly the same way you all have been.

I think I'm really done this time, but I could really use all the tips and motivation I can get to really quit this time. As I said I have been here before and I know I am capable of not smoking for two days. The longest I've gone. I want to be done for good. Thank you all for hearing me out. Tomorrow, I hope, is the first day of a new life.

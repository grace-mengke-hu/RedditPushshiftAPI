I missed school yesterday. Today I am going. I'm scared

So it's day 3. Not as in I completed 3 days but I am currently in day 3. 

Day 1 I had nicotine in the morning, so getting through school wasn't bad.

Day 2 I was exhausted, didn't sleep at all the night before, and coupling that with my low blood pressure there was just no way I was getting out of bed.

Day 3 I am not exhausted. I have crazy amounts of energy and that in itself is so relieving. I've been exhausted for months (due to an ulcer), and being able to get out of bed is amazing. But I am extremely high strung and anything slightly off puts me in to the biggest rage.

How do I get through my classes? I have to sit through a 2 hour lecture conducted by the most condescending person I've ever heard speak and I really don't know if I can do it without embarrassing myself in some way. 

Also day 3!! Everyone tells me it gets easier after today I really hope you are all right.

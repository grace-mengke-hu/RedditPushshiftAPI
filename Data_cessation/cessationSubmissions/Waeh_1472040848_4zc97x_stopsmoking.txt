Need help (Detailed analysis of my situation is in the post)

Hi everyone, this will be my first post here, as I was considering quitting I've found this subreddit. I'm really in a tight situation and below I'll write down the reasons why I don't want to quit and why I should quit. I need your help on making my mind.
Here it goes:

1) Why I feel like I can't quit?

-I work at a job which I don't like at the moment, I work a lot and get tired and bored during the day and smoking makes me relax massively.

-I'm at a psychologically unstable stage. I'm nowhere near where I planned to be. Broken up with my 2 year long girlfriend, and that loss combined with the things I don't like about my life is putting a massive burden on me. I feel as if I don't smoke I would freak out and always be angry and aggressive. I'm sure of this because at the moment when I don't smoke for a few hours I burst out at people for small reasons and simply start shaking.

-I enjoy smoking and just to think about the cigarette I'm going to smoke next makes me happy.

2) Why I should quit?

-For the past few months my heartrate has considerably increased. Even while I'm sitting I can feel it and it's sometimes hard to breath.

-Even when I climb stairs I lose my breath and start heavily breathing afterwards.

-This applies to sports and even while I have sex I feel like my heart would burst right there and I would have a heart attack. I'm extremely out of cardio.

-I'm 25 years old and if I'm like this at this age, I'm afraid of my future.

Conclusion I came to: Here I feel like I need to choose between my psychological and physical well-being. Or maybe I should wait until I'm satisfied with my own life and try to quit afterwards? 
Or maybe, to try to preserve both, if I replace cigarettes with nicotine, how much difference would it make? Will I see a considerable increase in my physical health?

Sorry for the long post, but I don't know what to do.

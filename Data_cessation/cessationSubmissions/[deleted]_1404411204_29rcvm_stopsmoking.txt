Worried about tonight

So tonight is the first time since I have quit, that I will be going back into the office to work and I am worried.  

You see I work backshift doing tech support over the phone.  It is a pretty sweet shift as there are not many calls and the people I work with are awesome.  The issue is that we have a few busy spurts, usually after the first 3ish hours, them around 6ish hour mark and then, possibly during the last hour.  In between those, however, it is slow.  This is where I used to love going out for a smoke, as it gave me something to do and I was able to get out and see the night sights, which at times have been "interesting" to say the least.  Now the nice part is that my other 2 co workers are non smokers and have been bugging me for some time to quit, but I still fear.  As I type this, I am wondering if I am over thinking this and that the night will go by well without me breaking again. 

Sorry for the long rant, just needed to get this off my chest.

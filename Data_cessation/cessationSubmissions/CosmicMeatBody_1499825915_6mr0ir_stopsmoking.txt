Can eating foods with nicotine act as Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT)?

I can't find a lot about this online. 

I've read that nicotine naturally occurs in some foods such as cauliflower, eggplant, and potatoes.

(A quick google search will reveal more).

These foods have significantly lower amounts of nicotine than what you find in cigarettes, but could consuming these foods help with nicotine withdrawals when quitting smoking?

Any thoughts or knowledge or research about this worth sharing. Thanks and best of luck. I'm on day 5 (not sure if my badge is there already or not)

Ten days down and I'm having to re-train myself on how to deal with people.

Since I'm no longer going outside to smoke, I'm finding myself trapped in awkward conversations in my office I don't want to be a part of...or people will just start telling me...*things* I couldn't care less about.  

I know it's the cranky...and not their fault.  But damn...I wish they'd shut up and let me be grouchy for the next few weeks.

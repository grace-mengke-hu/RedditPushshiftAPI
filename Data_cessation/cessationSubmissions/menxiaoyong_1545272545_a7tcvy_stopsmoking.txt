It is a little bit pit that I have never tried e-cigarette or cigar before quitting

It was said that e-cigarette or cigar is less harmful than cigarette. Is this correct?

Have noticed more and more westerns start smoking e-cigarette, just like a fashion.

Here in China those smokers who concern their health also start smoking e-cigarette.

have you ever tried these stuffs LoL

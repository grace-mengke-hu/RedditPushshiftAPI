Day 65

It's great when you can go enjoy a few beers and the thought of smoking doesn't cross your mind.

It's great when you wake up, and you don't even think about reaching for a pack and a lighter.

It's great being free from all that shit, saving money while getting a lot healthier.

Day 65 of the rest of my life.

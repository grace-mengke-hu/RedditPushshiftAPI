Been 15 days and my cravings won't go away

I quit smoking cold turkey at the beginning of this month (15 days ago). I smoked 2 packs a week for about 8 years.  I noticed many people have said their cravings subside after 3 or 4 days. I still have very strong cravings about every 2 hours...any suggestions?

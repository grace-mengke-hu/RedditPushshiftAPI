A month in, and still craving food!!

I am not a big guy, only weigh about 155, but in the last month I think i've gained about 5-8 lbs. I've quit before (many times! but this is my last i've promised myself) and i usually get hungry for the first week, but this time it does not seem to be going away. Any tips for dealing with it? I work out a little already btw

dark side, sapphire tonics with a city view.

i stared down two smokes in the freezer of my last pack. im saving them for something i know i will need, in the future. death, break up, pain, who knows. i'm by myself. darkside playing, girl is sleeping off the booze in the bedroom, these are the nights i have been avoiding, 88 days and counting; that temptation. 

but i know that in the morning if i smoke, ill feel like shit. like i've felt the last 5 years. nothing but shit and failure. i want to, i want that easy way out. i want that feeling.. without the toll. 

16mins in dark side and all i want is to smoke and fuck. 
fuuck!! i won't do it. i just love that romance.

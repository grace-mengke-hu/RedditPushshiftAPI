Does anyone get tightness in their throat?

I'm a few days in, and the feeling alternates between someone having their hand gently on my throat and the constant need to take a deep breath. It doesn't hurt, but it is unrelenting and annoying and it's right on the spot in my throat where the smoke would hit when I inhaled. Taking a deep breath offers momentary relief but the feeling returns pretty quick. I went to a doctor to get checked out and she said everything looked good except for some drainage from my sinuses that she thought might be allergies. (I've never been allergic to anything.) She gave me a nasal spray to try and it's not doing anything. I looked around online and it seems mild anxiety may be a culprit. The tight feeling is lessened when I'm lying down or relaxing. I know cigarettes make anxiety worse and [I'm never going back to them.](http://imgur.com/jaez9lA) Has anyone experienced anything like this when they quit? I smoked almost a pack a day for 15 years and I didn't have any other withdrawal symptoms except a mild stomach pang here and there. Sorry for the essay, but just typing this out made me feel better.

Advice please! I always end up returning to the dark side

Hello everyone, I'm new to Reddit and I'm hoping to find some advice here. I'm young (25M) and healthy, but work in the oil field (not a plus)

I've tried quitting smoking several times to no avail. I have tired e-cigs which did not do the trick. I don't see the point in patches/gum seeing as they cost the same if not more than a pack. Cold turkey could not get me past the dreaded car ride or post-meal cigarette! I've even read into hypnotism, which sounds legit/sketchy at the same time.

Basically, I'm looking for tips, advice, alternatives, ANYTHING! Good books and/or guides would be great as well!

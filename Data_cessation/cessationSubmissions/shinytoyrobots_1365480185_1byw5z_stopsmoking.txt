This time I just didn't tell anyone I was quitting...

...and it's worked bizarrely well so far.

I used the lozenges pretty regularly the first couple of days, but even those I'm barely using now. Eight days in, and I haven't been stressed, had minimal cravings, and even stood outside with my boss while he had a cigarette today without even the slightest desire to steal a cigarette!

I can't really think what's different this time. I've been smoking since I was 15, I'm 36 now, I've lost count of how many times I've tried and failed in the past (usually climbing the walls within a couple of days, and then cracking). Maybe it was just time.

I keep taking big deep breaths, just to notice the difference. :)

When I see smokers on the street...

When I smoked, I would see smokers on the street while I was walking to my destination. I never thought anything of it. Just a person, standing outside smoking. Much like I do. That person is cool like me. 

Yesterday, I was walking back to my hotel in Toronto and saw a girl smoking on the street outside a bar while talking on the phone. Then I saw two guys standing outside another bar chatting while smoking. In that instant, I couldn’t help but think to myself “is that what I looked like? Why are these guys smoking? There’s nothing cool about this at all!”

I’m not a non-smoker yet but I’m getting there. It was just surreal for me to have those new thoughts about myself.

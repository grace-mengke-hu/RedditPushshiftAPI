A poem to encapsulate my addiction

I've taken to writing some words down every so often and occasionally I'll do my best to capture that feeling of addiction. I hope some of you can relate and maybe even get something out of this.

 

Waves dash rocks into sands as I struggle 

in the tide to hold that ley line frayed yet brilliant 

against a world suffocated with weighty  stratus.

Who made these cotton anvils which now impress my ceiling with ominous mass 

Who planted I amongst the coraled pools pressed and digested with torrential thrust 

I have only to look inward to see that devious and despondent devil chipping away at the bedrock of my mind. 

Manically it plans to have all good drowned in place of frightful complacence 

Safety urged through the stagnation of all pure things.

It is I that must plunge into those catacombs of contemptuous hope 

And pierce the throat of that blaspheming charlatan.

Only then might I muster the might to slip from this leaded quilt

To grasp firmly a tattered line

And climb to altitudes un-oppressed.

Any helpful tricks?

I quit smoking on December 11th of last year (Day 29), but the whole time I have been at home on break from university. I go back in 14 days, and I am worried because that environment is a very big trigger for me. I'll be doing pretty much the exact same things that I have been doing for the past three semesters, but I won't have cigarettes to get through it all. Do any of you out there have any tricks or methods that you have used in the past to get through tough situations?

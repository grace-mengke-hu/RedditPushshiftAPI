Godamn it Ismoked yesterday.I smoked because I was drinking. I fucking hate myself for it. How do I make sure it never happens again.

It's fucking stupid because it doesn't give me a high or nothing it's just ruining my health that's why I stopped in the first place maybe I need to toughen up still appreciate any advice (I'm gonna eventually drink again socially so pls dont say dont drink im not an alcoholic)

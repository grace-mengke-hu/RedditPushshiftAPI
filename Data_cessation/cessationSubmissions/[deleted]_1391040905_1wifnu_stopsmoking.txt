Quit on new years, but feeling terrible stillâ€¦ I need advice!

After two and a half years of smoking throughout college I quit cold turkey as a new years resolution. The first week was hell, I was experiencing flu-like symptoms and could barely breathe/move. I scheduled an appointment with my doctor around 10 days in (told them I had quit) and was diagnosed with severe bronchitis. I was given prescriptions for a Z-pac, hydrocodone cough syrup, and chest steroids, as well as an inhaler (which i could not afford). The different meds brought me to good health, but over the last few days my original symptoms have been slowly returning. My chest feels tight, I wheeze while breathing, and I have been coughing up thick, clear phlegm. Should I visit the doctor again or is this normal? Also, my only relapse was sharing 1 cigarette with a friend this past weekend while hitting the town. Thank you! Any advice/information will help.

edit: tl;dr Is it normal to experience wheezing and cough up clear phlegm/mucous a month after quitting?

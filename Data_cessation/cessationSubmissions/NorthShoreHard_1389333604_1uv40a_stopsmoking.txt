So I'm sitting at work today

Sitting at my desk, as you do, and I think fuck, that absolutely stinks. Turn around and my mate has just come back from his break and having a smoke.

9 days ago people who sit next to me at work must have been thinking the exact same thing whenever I'd come back from break.

Sorry colleagues, I hope I smell a whole lot nicer now :)

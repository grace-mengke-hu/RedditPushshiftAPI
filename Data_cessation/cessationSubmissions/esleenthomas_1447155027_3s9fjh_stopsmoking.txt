Help! Trying to not smoke again.

Hi, 

I quit smoking 3 weeks ago and am still suffering from extreme lethargy. I have my finals coming up in 2 days and I absolutely cannot afford this level of lethargy. For example today, I woke up at 3pm after sleeping for 13 hours and then by 7pm had already had 3 large cups of coffee, 1 redbull and a can of coke. After drinking that much, I was so tired that I nearly fell asleep while trying to study. Now it's 10.26 pm and I'm almost ready to hit the sack. However, I won't fall asleep for another 3-4 hours and continue this cycle.   Before quitting, I was waking up at 7 everyday after going to bed at around midnight. Now I don't sleep as well and am having trouble keeping awake during the day. 

The last time I quit smoking, I remember being extremely lethargic for some time and asking my GP about lethargy being a side effect of quitting and he did say yes. It disappeared after a while. However, I started again after a big personal even afer quitting for a year or so. 

Now I'm thinking about starting again just for my exams which is for the next 2 weeks and quitting again which would give me time before my  next exams in June. I know it's stupid but I'm at the end of my wits on what to do. 

Also I have been exercising the same amount as before(5 mile runs 3-4 times a week) and eating pretty much the same food. Please help. Thanks.

Edit: Smoked a pack a day for the last 5-6 years(quit 1 year in the middle), and before that, smoked 1/2 pack a day for 3-4 years.

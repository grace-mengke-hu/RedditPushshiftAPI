My girlfriend has to quit, so I'm quitting too. It'll be easier for her this way. Any advice?

I've been smoking for 20 years, never tried to quit. It's been about a pack a day for a few years, sometimes more.   
She's been at it for about 15 years, also never tried to quit, but she smokes way less than me.     

I'm doing this to make it easier for her, but also because... Well, smoking is expensive, bad, and all of that.  
I'm banking on increasing time between each smoke, in order to get to a state where I can go a day without smoking. From there, I'll further widen the gap until I've not much need to do it at all.   
I can't quit cold turkey, because as things are now, I won't make it.   
Any tips would be appreciated! 
I'm keeping a log, and not allowing myself to smoke unless a set time has passed, and I think it's already getting easier.

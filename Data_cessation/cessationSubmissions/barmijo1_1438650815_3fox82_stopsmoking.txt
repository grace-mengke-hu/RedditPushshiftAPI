Cold Turkey or Slowly Ween?

I'm determined to quit, i haven't even had a smoke all day, but as night begins to fall and boredom sets in, I'm getting more and more anxious and the urge to smoke is heavy.  When i do smoke it's between half to a full pack a day. I have cut down recently to about 5. Im just wondering if i should just keep cutting down or try and go cold turkey.  What has worked best for you guys?

edit: Im not looking for permission to go and smoke a cigarette, just advice.

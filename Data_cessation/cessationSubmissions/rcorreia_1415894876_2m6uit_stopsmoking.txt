40 days

First time posting here. Needed a few encouraging words.

I'm smoke free for 40 days but still have a lot of cravings. I'm 27 and smoked for 10 years, about 15 per day. 

I've quit twice before (1 year the first time, and a couple of months the second) but ended up smoking again. I always quit while in the USA (which I travel to often for school), but every time I get back to Portugal it seems so much harder and I end up picking it up again.

I'm currently on my second week in Portugal, and experiencing strong craving.

Any advices?

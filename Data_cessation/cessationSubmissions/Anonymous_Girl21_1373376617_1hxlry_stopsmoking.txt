I've made it a YEAR!

**I have successfully not smoked 7,300 cigarettes, saved $2,920.28, and have increased my life by 3 weeks.** 


This year has been one chaotic journey, but I did it! Was it easy? Absolutely not. But what really helped me the most was my overwhelming motivation to stop, and a big amount of self discipline. I can't give you the magic words, but what I can say is if you really want this, you can do it. Smoking does NOTHING for you. It only hurts you, and is pretending to aid you in stress (I have anxiety, and yes, you will find ways to deal with your stress in a healthy manner.) Don't let fears and doubts control your life, you got this! Hey and I just want to say if you mess up, IT'S OKAY! Guess what? You are human! Keep up the great work guys, and never give up thanks so much for all the support and kind words throughout this year journey I hope to have many more!

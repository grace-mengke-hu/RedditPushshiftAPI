Out of breath after running at 22..

I had stopped smoking for 2 months and then started again slowly... This morning my friend and me had to sprint to catch the bus and i was out of breath it really made me realize how bad this is... I'll smoke my last cigarette tomorrow and hopefully will be the last one for a long time.

Unexplained major weight loss? Is it due to smoking?

Hey guys. I'm in the process of quitting smoking. Started on Friday so its been three days now (our time zone). As a scrawny guy with a general high metabolism, I've lost around 5 kg in the last 3 months - which is just under 10% of my body weight. I don't usually smoke a lot but in the last month I've probably doubled my cigarette intake because I was going through a really stressful time in my life. Have any of you experienced major weight loss in such a short period of time? Is it possible for smoking to make you lose that much weight?

Physically craving cigarettes when hungover

I drank a little too much last night. However, I did not smoke. 

I've been in smoking bars since quitting, and I did not crave cigarettes the next day. For some reason, today I have a real physical craving for cigarettes.

Has anyone else experienced this? Perhaps it's something related to hangover metabolism, or I'm just used to craving cigarettes more after a big drinking night and chain-smoking, and this is some sort of behavioral conditioning.

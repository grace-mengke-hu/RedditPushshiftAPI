Are you a non-smoker who used to smoke?

Or are you a smoker who chooses not to smoke?  I was talking to my dad the other day about my quit journey and he was telling me how proud he is of me.  We got talking about his quit journey.  He stopped smoking about 25 years ago.  He was a real heavy smoker - 60 a day of cigarettes that i don't think they make any more because they were so strong.  He had smoked since the age of 11 and was into his 50's when he stopped.  

About 5 years ago I was watching him doing some gardening and when he stood up he did that thing he had always done when he smoked which was patting his pockets to look for his cigs.  We discussed it and he remembers it very clearly.  He then went on to say he considers himself a smoker who chooses not to smoke.  He still loved the thought of smoking but the cost of cigarettes and the health impact meant that he chose never to smoke again.  Fortunately the cravings are very weak and do not happen on a regular basis.

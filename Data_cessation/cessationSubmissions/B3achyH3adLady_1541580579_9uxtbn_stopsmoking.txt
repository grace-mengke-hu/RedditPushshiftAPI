First Day First Blunder

It feels like I have been married to smoking for at least a decade. I have tried to separate several times before. The nights usually go well, as did my umpteenth attempt yesterday eve.  However the mornings seem to serenade me with a siren calling me back to my abusive relationship. So I cracked and smoked. Regret it now. Any morning tips?

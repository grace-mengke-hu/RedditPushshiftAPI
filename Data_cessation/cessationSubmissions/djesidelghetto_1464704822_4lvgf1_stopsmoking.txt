Day 1... again

Well, my last go (like most of my other attempts) at not smoking was a bust, but I woke up this morning at 6, went outside, smoked half of the filthy little bastard and just felt this sharp pain in my chest almost as if my heart hurt.  That was it.  I'd bought boxes of nicotine patches and gum a few days ago and after that last cigarette I slapped a patch on.

It's been four hours since my last cigarette.  The seconds feel like they're going on for minutes and the minutes for hours, but I need to do this.

I loved smoking.  I know all the reasons why I shouldn't, but I still did.  I hate quitting.  HALP.

Day two and I’m a wreck... flipping wedding anniversary...

Hey guys. I’m on Day three and am just feeling SO low... it would have been my wedding anniversary today, but we got divorced four years ago... I’ve never really cared about this day before, but I think it’s just hit me that I’m single, 42, no kids (we couldn’t have them hence why our marriage went a bit pear shaped) and here I am giving up smoking for what?!?! No-one actually gives a crap whether I smoke or not, at least that’s what it feels like. I can’t stop crying, gah I feel like such a bloody wimp! Sorry, I have no idea what I actually expect people to say, probably nothing, but I just needed to share. I never felt like this the last time I gave up, I managed ten years without feeling like a complete wreck... funnily enough it was the divorce that made me start again (idiot) so rather ironic that today, my wedding anniversary, is the thing that’s making me question my whole life! Sorry for ranting :(

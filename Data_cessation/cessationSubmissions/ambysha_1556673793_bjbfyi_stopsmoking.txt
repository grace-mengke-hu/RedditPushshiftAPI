This week is rough.

I smoked my last cigarette 16 days ago which is the longest I've gone in about 15 years. It's been ok so far, but this week has been rough and it's only Tuesday. Work has been insanely crazy and I realize that professional stress is a trigger for me. When I'm home I feel fine, but at work I'm overwhelmed with cravings. I've been staying strong and reminding myself that a cigarette isn't going to make the stress go away, but it is definitely a struggle. I'll be impressed if I make it through the week without giving up, but I'm hoping I can make it since I hate the idea of starting at Day 1 again. Not looking for advice per se, just wanted/needed to share!

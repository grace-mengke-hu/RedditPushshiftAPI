Nicorette Gum?

Opinions?

I just bought a 20 pack off Amazon for like 10 bucks. Im hoping to just pop one the first week or two when my cravings get insane. Ive tried the patch before and it worked pretty good but wanted to try something different. 

Im not a huge fan of gum so Im hoping I wont get addicted like some of the reviews stated.

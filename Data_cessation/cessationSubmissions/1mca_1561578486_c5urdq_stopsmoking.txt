Guys!!! I've made through day three!!!

I posted earlier that I was a work only smoker because it gave me breaks and I work in a stressful environment. Well... I made it past the crucial day 3. For me day 3 signifies a lot. Everything is out of my system and from here on out it's only a head game. I have two more days of work but I'm feeling really confident. At least about today. I'll worry about tomorrow tomorrow.

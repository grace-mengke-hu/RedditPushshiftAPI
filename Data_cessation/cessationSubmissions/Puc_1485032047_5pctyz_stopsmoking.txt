40 days - easily angered and bad sleep

I quit cold turkey 40 days ago after smoking 10 cigarettes a day for 3 years. Didn't have all that bad withdrawal symptoms compared to my previous attempts in 2016 (none lasted longer than a month), though this time I feel very irritable, quick-tempered and easily angered. People aren't used to see me like that, I'm embarrassed of myself.  
Besides that, I also have a hard time sleeping. Normally I need around 7 hours, last three weeks I can't even reach 5 hours. I wake up in the middle of the night, unable to get back to sleep. 
Does any one else experience the same things after quitting smoking?

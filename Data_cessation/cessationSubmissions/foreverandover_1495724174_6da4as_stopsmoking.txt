Day 4- I just need some support.

Hey guys. Smoker for about 10 years here. I'm on day 4 quitting cold turkey, and I feel like each day is just getting worse and worse. My husband was supposed to be quitting with me, but he decided to just cut back slowly. 


Right now I can't concentrate at all. I keep crying randomly, and I feel like something is terribly wrong. I keep pacing around my house like a crazy person. I know mood swings are a thing, but for how long?! I've tried to talk to my husband about it and he just tells me to take "a drag or two", but I know if I do..I'll just be right back where I started. 


I just hate this so fucking much. Tell me it's worth it, please. 




Edit: Thank you to everyone who read this, and took the time to reply. I made it through the day without caving. I owe it to you guys. <3

6 days is a new record. Going drinking tonight. . .

Wish me luck! I am gonna will my way through any cravings. I had a nightmare last night about smoking, and it was awful. I can tell that I'm falling into my second wave (after the first 3 days) of having hardcore mood swings and cravings, but damn it I am 22 years old and I refuse to be a smoker the rest of my life! I'm gonna learn to party without the crutch :)

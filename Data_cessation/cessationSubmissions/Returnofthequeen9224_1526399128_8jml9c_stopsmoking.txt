5 years, and that’s it

I’ve been smoking for a little over 5 and a half years, and I promised myself that when I finished my latest pack, that was it. Well, today I had the last cigarette in my pack, so it’s my last day. 

I started feeling guilty when we got our new kitten. I always smoke outside, but I know the smoke gets in my hair and clothes, and she’s so small I don’t want her to get sick. It’s been less than an hour, and I’m already anxious and want another smoke. 

But I want to be healthier. I joined a gym 2 months ago, and go at least 2x a week. So the next step is to end my addiction. 

Here we go! 2017-05-15

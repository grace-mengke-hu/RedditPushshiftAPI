Question for ex-smokers; After the initial withdrawal, what is the effect on stress?

Hi all,

I've set myself a deadline, monday morning. Got myself some patches, fully cold turkey isn't going to work me.

What I wondered though is; I've been a heavy smoker for the past 8 years and I'm constantly stressed. Especially in the morning, I go through 6 or 7 in the first 3 hours that I'm awake and I'm constantly switching between stressed and somewhat relaxed.

From some resources online I understand that for a smoker you actually feel 'normal' when you smoke, and worse than you normally would when you are not smoking. So i was wondering, when I quit will I actually feel calmer overall?

I did a test run with a nicotine patch yesterday (checking if they even work and if I'm not allergic), I only smoked 5 yesterday total and all day I felt way more relaxed Ã¡nd productive. No constant ups and downs with stress, just stable. I really want to quit but on one hand I'm afraid that I'll just be stressed out all the time, thought coming here might ease my mind a little.

Thanks for reading.

Day One: The journey begins

So I started smoking at 13. I am now 21 and I have decided to quit smoking because I just can't seem to slow down. I'm almost getting at the point that I smoke a pack a day. I have almost made it through day one. I have noticed the biggest issue I am having with quitting smoking is just not being able to use it as a excuse to take a break from my desk and go outside for 5-10 minutes. And that i really want a cigarette. But mostly the breaks I get during the day. Any suggestions for how to remedy it?

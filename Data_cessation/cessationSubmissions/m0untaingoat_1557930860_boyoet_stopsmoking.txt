Not smoking is way easier than smoking

Just having one smoke because you're hanging out with your friend who smokes, then buying a pack because your day was shit but only smoking a couple, or keeping it for the weekend because you're going out but will be done by Monday, it's all so fucking exhausting. Not smoking, or bumming cigarettes, or having them at home, or an emergency one in the car, is so much easier. It's like putting down a backpack of bullshit and knowing you never have to pick it up again.

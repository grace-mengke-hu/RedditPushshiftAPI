First night at work without smoking. How do you cope with not smoking at workplace?

Smoked last one yesterday morning and now I'm having my first nightshift without smoking. I'm working in hotel's front desk and during the day  smoking was the only way to have 5 peaceful minutes in damn stressful job and in the night it was nice to go outside, stand by the river, look at the historical landscape of my city and have a smoke, making time go by. And now as I'm here all alone, with nearest opened shop 1000m away from here, there's no way to get cigarettes for next 9 hours. If I had a pack here I'm sure I would smoke, I feel like losing my motivation. Everyone at work smoke and I can't imagine not smoking when they'll all come here in the morning asking me to go out for a smoke. Shit, I'm like heroin addict ;/.

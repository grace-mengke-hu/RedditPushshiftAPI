Slipping back into smoking

Hi everyone,
Some advice or encouragement would be appreciated!
Over the past 2 months, I've gradually been slipping back into a smoking habit after more than 2 years of not smoking. 
Until a few months ago, I was a very proud non-smoker, amd it changed my life for the better. I loved the health benefits and lifestyle changes that quitting afforded me.
I especially liked hanging out with friends and having a few beers without having the cravings of chain smoking that used to accompany a night of drinking. The trouble started a month and a half ago, when I started socially smoking and buying cigarettes after drinking a few beers.
Now, after a great holiday cycling with my father around Japan where I rarely smoked at all, I find that my urges to quit are mounting and myself giving in more frequently now I am back on my own.
I'm staying in a hotel and in the lobby are cheap cigarettes. The temptation is quite strong to go and buy some.
I've downloaded apps, and coming to reddit for support amd advice. 
I know I can be a non smoker again, i just need some support and encouragement and I fully intend on helping others on this groupmas well.
Thanks for reading!

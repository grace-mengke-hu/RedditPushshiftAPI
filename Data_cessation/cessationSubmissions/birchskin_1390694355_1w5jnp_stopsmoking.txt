Electronic Cigarettes

So I quit just about 3 weeks ago cold turkey (the easy way). Still getting occasional cravings but even in situations where it should be tempting am not too worried about losing my resolve. Was at a wedding last night drinking and hanging out with smokers and wasn't even phased.

That all said, at various points trying to quit in the past I used electronic cigarettes - they never helped me quit, and I'd always lose interest in favor of smoking and gave away the equipment and juices I had. The last week or so I've considered getting sent 0 nicotine stuff again and vaping just for the sake of vaping...

My question is, has anyone done this? I don't see the harm in ecigs for their own sake, with no nicotine, but am worried that my mind will associate it as a smoking substitute and will weaken my resolve to stay quit. Any thoughts? Should I just not fuck around and stop inhaling things for fun?

Edit: Thanks for the input everyone - I am not going to push it, it is probably just my addictive brain trying to trick me into smoking again. The advice here helped - no point in risking going backwards after 3 weeks.

Tomorrow is 70 whole days, but I need advice!

I couldn't wait to post, in case I'd forget. I'm **really** excited. Plus, I can actually run really well now - no more heaving/nauseous feeling! 

I'm also really nervous - I go home in 30 days. My SO and most of our friends smoke. He's tried to quit before and it's really hard for him. I'm kind of afraid I'll get drunk and smoke again (I also haven't drank since mid-January). Does anyone have pointers that help them when they're out with smoking friends? I live in VA, so the smoking ban in most establishments will help, but I'm still super nervous I'll cave when we're out for a smoke break...

Advice about getting rid of the brainwashing/ghosts.

So, I'm 2 weeks so far, feeling great about it, I quit with the help of Allen Carrs book, and this is the second time I did it, the first time I was 2 years free, started again when out drinking, took a puff from a friend (just because I wanted to belong, and thought I wouldn't fall back). This time, it's been two weeks.

I'm having some trouble now. A good friend of mine went out to smoke, and I almost asked him for one before realizing what I was about to do. I am not a smoker anymore. I don't want to be. I have to remind myself why I don't want to smoke. I have to remember how tiresome it was and why it would be pointless and stupid for me to go back to it.

But even then there is some ghost in the back of my head, a ghost that wants me to smoke again. I'm not entirely sure where it comes from, but I want it gone. Any advice is appreciated? :)

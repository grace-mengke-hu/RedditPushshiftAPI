It took everything I had in me..

to not pull over and buy a pack of cigarettes today. My boyfriend and I got into a huge fight (LDR which is already stressful enough) and I had the biggest craving to just buy a pack of smokes and smoke them all, but I told myself "If I do it for this fight, I'll continue to do it for each little situation in my life." So instead of pulling over and buying a pack of smokes, I bought a powerade and kept driving!

It feels good!

I've got a game plan! Suggestions welcome :)

Hi everyone! 
  
It's been a while since I have ventured into this sub. 279 days apparently! I have not been remotely smoke free for that time. I have addiction issues aside from smoking. I'm a regular at AA and for me, smoking is a huge emotional crutch. Whenever I try to quit, it's obvious that I rely on cigarettes to keep me calm and I cannot "come down" from anxiety or stress without the aid of a cigarette. Since my life is free of any other substance abuse, the smoking thing is really bothering me. I want to be completely free! 
  
I feel like I'm ready! Enough is enough. Here is my plan:
  
I work with animals, so patience is absolutely necessary at my job. I am my own boss, so I've booked Sunday, Monday & Tuesday of next week off work. I'm going to stock up on cleaning supplies, aromatherapy, bath salts, hair masks, face masks and recipe ingredients. For each day, i will have a list of things to do.. Clean out closet, clean floors, organize pantry, laundry, bake cookies, make dinner etc. The bath supplies is for if I'm feeling overwhelmed. Also, there's always yoga. And tea. 

I want to do this cold turkey. What do you guys think? Any opinions or input is so welcome! Thanks for reading!

Was reminded yesterday that I used to smoke

My mother said, "so how's the quitting going?"

At that point I realized I hadn't thought about a cigarette in days. For the first few weeks I would screenshot my app and send it to her and other friends as a way to cope. It was essentially fishing for support, but whatever works right? 

She made mention how I hadn't sent a screenshot for a couple weeks. It's true, I haven't because smoking isn't even in my mind anymore. 

I can't believe how much easier it has become. You all were right when saying so. 

15/day for 10 years. Never going back.

Question about taste for ex smokers

So I quit smoking last Wednesday and it's been great. I already feel so much better and my energy levels have skyrocketed. My only concern  so far has to be my taste. I've noticed, especially since Saturday, that everything I'm used to eating tastes so different. I had a glass of milk this morning and it tasted terrible. It's not just food either. Gum, water, soda etc all tastes so different that some of it I just don't even enjoy anymore. 

Is this normal? Has anyone experienced this before?

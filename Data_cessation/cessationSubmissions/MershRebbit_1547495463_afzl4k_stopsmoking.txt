Trying again

I know I’m not the first one to try, fail and try again.  Right after New Year’s last year, I made it 7 days.  Then failed.  Now I’m at 3 days smoke free.  And last night was hard.  But I didn’t smoke. My life is in shambles right now, and I feel like a cigarette would make me feel better.  But I know it wouldn’t.  Sorry for the ramble, but this is tough to do.  I knew y’all would support me.  Thanks for listening.

Is this a craving?

107 days smoke free!!! ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ
Never thought it would possible. Honestly! when I decided to quit I was not so sure about myself that I would do it so long. Just the thought of it would make me smoke a cigarette...
I smoked (still a bit weird to say it on the past) since 18 yo until 34. (Already 35 at the moment). The longest I got other times I tried to quit was one week. So, 2 months and a half is just great!
I really feel the difference on breathing and resistance doing sport. I also sleep better and been feeling great. Most of the time I don't even remember that I used to smoke. Never thought It would be possible for me to get this stage: Not thinking all the time on cigarettes! Knowing how I used to think, is just Unbelievable! Although, sometimes I fell like "I miss something" or "I want something". Other times I knew it was a sign to go for a cigarette. I still have these feelings but I really don't fancy a cigarette. If I think "is it a cigarette that you wish?" I just know it's not. It's weird. Just a felling that something is missing. Will that go away too with time? Did I had that before smoking and I don't remember?

Quitting: day 1

Hi, everyone. Today is my first smoke-free day. I'm also quitting alcohol at the same time and hope I can keep my sh*t together.

I've quit before but always end up starting again and I want to break that cycle. I need to find other ways to deal with stress and anxiety. I'm 47 and I need to take accountability for my health.

So that's why I'm here. Thanks for reading.

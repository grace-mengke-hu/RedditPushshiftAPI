When did your cravings peak?

Hi there, I'm new here and very early on into my quit (day 3). 

I've been at this point in an attempt many times before and for me it's always been the worst. The good thing is I know it gets easier because I've felt it be easier before. This time does feel different maybe because I'm not putting as much pressure and guilt on myself (I haven't told many people or made it too much of a *thing*).

What point in quitting has been the hardest or the one where you've felt withdrawal the most?

81 days!

It is still challenging - some days are more difficult than others - but I am incredibly happy and proud I have made it this far. 
I still experience long lasting cravings and it generally feels like I have been PMSing non stop for weeks (crying randomly, impatient, sensitive, moody) and i would love some advice on how to handle that aspect + how long should I expect it to last if anyone else has experienced something similar. 
Thanks!

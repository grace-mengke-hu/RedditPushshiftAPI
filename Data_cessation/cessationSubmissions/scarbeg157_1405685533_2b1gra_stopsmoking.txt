Day 3 and having serious smoking nostalgia

I have been a smoker for 19 years, about 3/4 of a pack a day. I am having serious nostalgia cravings/sadness this morning. I am really missing sitting on my front step with a cigarette. My social life has always been parking it at a table outside at a bar with my friends smoking and drinking and talking for hours. I know I won't be able to do that for a good long while. I know it'll pass and I'll start missing it less over time, but right now it's really really tempting to stop at the store and buy a pack on my way to work. Kind of just posting here to get this out. If I verbalize it, I can fight it. Hopefully.

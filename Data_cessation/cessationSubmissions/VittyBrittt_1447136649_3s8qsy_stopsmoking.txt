Very very nervous......

I just joined because the stop smoking app I bought recommended this site. My quit date is today. The cravings are out of control and I am wearing a patch. My main concern is that I work in a casino where EVERYONE smokes. I am trying to stay positive, but I must admit I am nervous. If anyone on here quit while working in a casino and has some pointers,  I would really appreciate them :)

Day 38! I hope my method continues to work for me.

I am checking in to report that I am on day 38 without having a cigarette (although I will confess that, 10 days in, I bummed one off of my GF -- but I put it out after a few drags because it was disgusting).  
  
I'm still addicted to nicotine, but I have been transitioning to lower nicotine level e-liquid every week (I've been using a vaporizer e-cig as a cessation device). Tomorrow I will be transitioning to the lowest level before I transition to zero nicotine the following week. I know that is when the real challenge will begin.  
  
I feel great not inhaling burnt plant matter, saving hundreds of dollars a month, and reducing my nicotine tolerance, but I worry sometimes what is going to happen to me when I transition to zero nicotine liquid. I'm not sure if I will want to keep vaping to satisfy the need to "smoke" something, or if I will just throw my device away and call it a day. I don't know how my body is going to react when I stop giving it nicotine. I guess I am hoping that by transitioning my nicotine levels down gradually over the last 38 days, it won't be so dramatic when I finally go to zero nicotine.  
  
Has anyone else had experience quitting cigs using a method like this? And what changes did your body go through after fully eliminating nicotine from your system? I know I can google this stuff but I find it motivating to engage in discussion within /r/stopsmoking and read your personal accounts.

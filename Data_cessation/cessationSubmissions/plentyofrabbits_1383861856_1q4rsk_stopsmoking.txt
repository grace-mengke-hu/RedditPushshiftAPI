This is the first time I'm scared

So, I agreed to run some errands on my way home from work. The errands need to get run, no doubt about it. 

But this is my first time going to a store since I quit last saturday. I've been completely smoke free and in general I'm finding this pretty easy (thanks Chantix) but I'm really afraid I'll cave and buy a pack. 

Of course, I know I'm going to beat that, but this is a real challenge right now...and I'm reaching out in the hopes I can get some advice? How did you do your first time encountering the cigarette display and wanting to buy some but overcoming that?

cold turkey day one

cold turkey day one

I relapsed two days ago after being without a smoke for nine weeks :( I smoked around two packs a day. I took nicotine lozenges this nine weeks. 

I resetted my 'smoke free app'. I want to do it cold turkey this time. With a little help of 'smoke free app'., mindfulness and sport.  i have the opinion that nicotine replacement for me is a form of swapping the old addiction for a new one. Nine weeks is great but never felt truly as a non smoker. Although i sincerely want to quit

Any ideas / tips are welcome

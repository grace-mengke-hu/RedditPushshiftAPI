Crazy realization just hit me!

So as 2015 comes to a close, I like many others are reflecting on the year that 2015 was.  That is when I realized something amazing!  I quit November 18th 2014.  I haven't had one single puff from a cigarette the entire year of 2015!  So much has happened this year that I finally realized that now!  It's an amazing feeling everyone!

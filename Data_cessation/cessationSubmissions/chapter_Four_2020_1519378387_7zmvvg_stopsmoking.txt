found a cigarette in a dream...

well, last night i was dreaming about hanging out with old friends (quit weed also, now i don't talk to them...sad story). and then were lying a cigarette, i picked it up and told myself "one occasional smoke won't hurt", took the lighter, then i said: "nah i don't need it"... and put down the cig and lighter... 

then i woke up shocked! i was so confused when i woke up and the first thing that hit me up is that:" if that was a dreams, and dreams are the window of the subconscious mind... that's mean... my subconscious mind is over cigarette too? that mean i'm free in my conscious and subconscious!!! ... only took 1 month !!!! guys go at it!!!! 

if you still find craving after long time of not smoking you might want to do a litter more shift in your attitude of mind about smoking... it's really don't give shit, 0 , read allen carr book, i red it 3 times!! but i finally got to his point... it's all about shifting our thinking about smoking and it become so easier to deal with the rehab of it!.... iv'e never been so happy! i thought i'm gonna suffer all my life with craving a cigarette, now i know i will never touch again , N.O.P.E is what i see and think whenever weird thought come to my mind. NO ONE PUFF EVER, and remember kids to have fun! :p

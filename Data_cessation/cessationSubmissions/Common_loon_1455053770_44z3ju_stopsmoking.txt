Long time lurker. I'm starting today. Need to break out of this sick routine.

I have been subbed/unsubbed to this subreddit for awhile now. I started smoking about 3.5 years ago in college. I am finishing up my last semester and have a ton of things to look forward to...proposing to my GF...traveling to Europe...getting a degree. I just want to be done with this terrible addiction. I have done countless half-assed quit attempts and haven't made it over 3 days. I just crushed my pack and threw it away. I want to quit. 

I hate the ritual of going out for a smoke. I hate feeling like I need to clear my throat. I hate hiding my habit from others. I want a healthier future for myself and loved ones. God its so hard to quit. I really need to see this through. It makes me so frustrated just thinking about the time/money/effort/health that I through away because of a stick of tobacco has me in its grips. 

Sorry for the rant. I needed to do it. Ill post again once I make it over my 3 day barrier.

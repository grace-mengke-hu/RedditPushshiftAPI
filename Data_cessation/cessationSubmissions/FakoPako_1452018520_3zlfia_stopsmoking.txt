Former smokers...tell us your story how does it feel now?

I am in a quest of desperately trying to stop smoking. I keep going back to it...quit for a little bit and then back to it. So far this year, 2016 has been smoke free. 

One of the things I love to read is the former smokers, 6 months, 1 year, 5 years in, telling how they feel right now and how their life changed. It's really motivating. 

Let's hear some stories!

The Smells. Oh my god the SMELLS!

I’m 7 days in &lt;insert Elaine from Seinfeld dance or Macaulay Caulkin scene when he realizes his parents are gone, “IM FREEEEEE”. Just kidding, I know I’m not out of the woods yet, but the smells, let me tell ya! I woke up this morning to a sweet scent. I couldn’t for the life of me figure out what it was? Turns out, it was me!!! There was still a hint of my perfume on my wrists from yesterday, and I could STILL smell it. I had gotten to the point where I’d stopped wearing my favorite perfume, I didn’t to waste it and I would cover up with body sprays, gums and lotions all day and I also didn’t want to mix “flavors” (like anyone smelled anything other than the disgusting cigarette). I can’t believe the improvement in just 7 days, can’t wait to see what the next holds:)

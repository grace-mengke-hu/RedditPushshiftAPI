Can you ever be normal again?

After quitting smoking for good, will things ever be the same? 

Can you ever return to the state of health and mind that you were before you became addicted?

EDIT: thank you all for your replies. I found multiple answers to my question, whereas I thought there was only one answer. Thanks again. Smiley face :)

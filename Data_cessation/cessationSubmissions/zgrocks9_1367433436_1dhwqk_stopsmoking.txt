Excuse my language, but HOLY SHIT! I feel amazing! (4 months in).

Today marks 4 months since I quit at this time on New Years morning. According to my counter on my phone, I've not smoked 960 pieces, I've saved almost $350, and my lungs are free of 7.681 g of tar.

I feel amazing right now. Quitting smoking was the first step I've taken towards a healthier lifestyle. Since then, I've been working out consistenly at three days a week since early February (I've gained 6 pounds of muscle already!), I'm more conscious about what I eat (more of a paleo diet now), and I'm even starting my first yoga class this weekend! 

And it is all due to this subreddit. I had tried and tried before to quit, but then I found you guys, I read Allan Carr, and I made the decision to just force my mind to say no whenever offered a cigarette. I took one drag at a party while I was drunk, and I immediately hated it. I cannot thank you guys enough. I feel amazing, my quality of life has improved immensely, and I am more motivated. I've even stopped smoking weed and drinking as often as I did. 

Quitting cigarettes has done so much for me. I just want to say thank you one more time, I love the feeling of being healthy.

Yet another smoking dream

So, I had smoking dreams before: twice I dreamt that I was tempted to smoke but didn't. I posted about it here, and someone joked I should have smoked, which made me laugh.

Anyhow, just today I had a dream in which I did smoke! I bought a pack of red Gauloises for some reason (no idea why, but I remember feeling confused over the various brands). And I did not light up consciously: it just happened while I was on the computer, just absent-mindedly opening the pack, getting the cigarette out, lighting up, all without a single conscious thought (this used to happen to me years ago, back when I was smoking inside the house, and I hated it).

Now, conditioned by this sub, I figured I should destroy the pack. But there was a nagging feeling of "just one more". And then I woke up, drenched in sweat, and I did not know if it really happened or not.

Moral of the story? There's none, it's just a dream.

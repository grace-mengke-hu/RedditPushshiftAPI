Hating everything

Anyone else feeling pissed all the time? Im 5 days in and have this constant underlying feeling of being angry at everything and everyone! The only time this seems to go away is when i work out to deal with the cravings or sleep. I`m VERY determined to quit, but is this normal? Its almost borderline funny, I almost fought a pigeon on my balcony the other day....

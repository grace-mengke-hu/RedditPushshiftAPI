Fighting so hard...

Today is crazy. Day 5 and the stress of work and home is huge right now. All I can think about is having a smoke. I'm literally standing outside the building right now to just pretend that I have a smoke break... Some time away from the grind.
I'm furiously chewing some 2 nicotine gum, telling myself "I won't give in, I won't give in."
Worse still, I'm actually on the verge of tears. Tears!
I'm a big dude, tough and fairly strong. And this shit is dragging me down.

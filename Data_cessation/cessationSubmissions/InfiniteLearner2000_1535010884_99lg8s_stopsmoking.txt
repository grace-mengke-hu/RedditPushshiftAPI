Quitting Messing w/ Sleep???

I didn't realize quitting would mess with the quality of my sleep. I can't seem to get more than 3 - 4 hours consecutively now.   


Anything I can do to help with this sleeping issue? Other than having nicotine? I went from roughly 1/2 a pack a day for 10,11 years to just stopping this passed Monday.   


I have a mental health issue that requires that I get sleep regularly. Concerned over here.

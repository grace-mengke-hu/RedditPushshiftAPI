Day one. While studying for the bar exam. This is gonna be tough.

One of my friends told me that it was a terrible idea to quit while studying for the bar.  But I've justified *not* quitting time and time again for the same reason (can't quit, final exams...can't quit, LSAT...etc.).  Been ten years.  It's time.

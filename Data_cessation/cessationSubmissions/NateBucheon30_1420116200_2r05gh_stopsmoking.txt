New Years 2015. My progress so far.

Its 9:37pm and I havent smoked since probably 6:00am this morning when I got home from the New Years Party.   Right now I am hiding in the guest bedroom avoiding interaction with anyone because I feel irritable and tired.  I am chewing nicotine gum and might try the patch tomorrow.

I am 30 years old and have been smoking since 9th grade.  Its been a pack a day since I was 18 or 19.  This is probably gonna suck.

Wish me luck!   I will post updates

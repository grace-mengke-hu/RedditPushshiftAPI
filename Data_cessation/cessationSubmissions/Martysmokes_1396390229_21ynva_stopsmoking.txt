Day 3. Could use some support and tips

Hey everyone, so here I am on day 3 at work. Days 1 and 2 were tough but it seems much harder today for some reason. I feel like I might cave but I haven't yet. I hate this habit, it's disgusting and not beneficial at all but for some reason I still want one and my lungs still have that "tingle". Any help and support would be really appreciated. Nobody is aware that I'm quitting either because I'm only 19 and my parents never found out so I don't have any real support besides a friend.

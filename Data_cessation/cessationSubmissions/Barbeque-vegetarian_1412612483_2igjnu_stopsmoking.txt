My girlfriend needs some help.

As a birthday present for her friend, she promised to quit and made me promise to not allow her to when she asks. I've recently found out from a friend that she still does almost every morning waiting for the bus. I'm not sure how to approach it because most of the time i genuinely don't smell or taste anything but on a rare occasion I do, but I'm not sure how to help if she hides it from me. Is there any sure way for me to tell when she has so I can bring it up?

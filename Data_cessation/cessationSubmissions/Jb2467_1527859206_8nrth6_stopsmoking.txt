Day 4 of cold turkey...but it’s Friday!

It’s the 4th day of my cold turkey quit. The first three days weren’t as bad as I thought, but I feel that tonight will be the biggest test. Friday and Saturday have always been the biggest issue for my wife and I when we try to quit. I’m even tempted to buy a pack as I’m writing this post. Ugh! Tell me to stay strong this weekend. Millions of people have quit and I can too.

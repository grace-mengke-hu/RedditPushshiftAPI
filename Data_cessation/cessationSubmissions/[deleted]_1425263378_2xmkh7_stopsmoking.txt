Day 1

So, this is probably a bit unusual, but I've been in an on-again off again battle to stop smoking cigars, cigarillos and pipes. I'll go a while come back to it, get nicotine-sick once in a while, puke, go a couple days, then have another go. Jolly good fun. Yesterday my 2 year old caught me smoking on the porch for the first time, and he had the curious "What's daddy doing?" Look on his face (cause right now everything daddy does is cool). I felt like utter shit. Here's hoping documentation and some encouragement may help me shake this thing once and for all. I don't want my kid growing up with a dad who's a smoker.

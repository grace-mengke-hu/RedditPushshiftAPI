"Weekend smoker" trying to find a way to quit for good.

I'm not sure if that's the best way to describe it, but I have an on-off relationship with smoking... mainly that I do not smoke at all unless I'm drinking. And if I'm drinking, I will smoke at least a pack in one night. Then I go to work, live my life and don't even have a craving. It's hard for me to relate to people who have daily cravings, or even use those apps to help you quit, because my intake is all over the board. I probably drink with my friends a few nights a week, and almost all of them are smokers as well. Any tips or tricks to help me get started with separating the two vices would be much appreciated!

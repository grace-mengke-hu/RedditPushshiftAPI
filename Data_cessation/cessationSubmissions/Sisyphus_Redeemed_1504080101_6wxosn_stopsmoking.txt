Relapse and tight sensations

So I've been clean for about a year and a half when I succumbed to taking a whif of dokha. (It's a stronger tobacco usually imported from Dubai). After taking the huge puff and swallowing, I started suffocating and gasping for air for around 8 seconds (there was a buzz associated with it, but nothing worth the suffocation in the process). I was coughing for the next hour or so and started getting paranoid that I'd done something bad to my lungs and started feeling guilty. 
Anyways, four days later I still get these tight sensations in my chest and back. They're not painful, just noticeable tight sensations. 
I've been been reading about it and some people seem to suggest that these sensations are psychosomatic. ( psychologically induced)
Could it also be due to coughing hard? 
Has anyone else felt these tight sensations after smoking, especially when they'd stopped for a while?
*edit*: there is also this dull ache in my upper back, but that could also be from camping?

Why should I stop craving nicotine after some days?

TL;DR: **Why** should I stop craving cigarettes in the future?

If something in my body is addicted to nicotine, what's going to change if I stop taking it?

If one would stop eating he'll be hungry forever, eventually dying.

Why is nicotine different? Yes, nicotine is not needed by the body to properly function but why after some time my body should get accustomed to zero nicotine?

Also, why the lower the nicotine in blood the easier this process?

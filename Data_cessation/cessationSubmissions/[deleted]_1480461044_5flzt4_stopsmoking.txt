3 months clean hit by a huge craving, is this normal?

I expected the odd nostalgic look back at my time smoking and feeling like one, however, I just got hit by a huge wave of SMOKE A FUCKING CIG NOW after 3 months. Will this always be the case? I go through weeks of not even thinking about it. However the compulsion was so strong after this amount of time I think will I always just out of the blue be back to severe cravings even if for a moment? Is 3 months still relatively new in to the smoke free lifestyle that I should still expect these urges no matter how infrequent?

Is this a lifelong struggle?

I smoked cigs for 4 years, then got into vaping and found myself vaping all the time, increasing the nicotine amount as I went along. I decided to quit because I hate that everything I do revolves around my nicotine addiction. It takes up too much of my time. I would vape whenever I got the chance. 

I've gone a week without smoking or vaping now. I don't crave nicotine, I just crave the feeling of holding something and filling my lungs with smoke or vape and exhaling. I miss the process I guess. Does this ever go away? Will there always be triggers?

here we go!

I just put out my last cigarette. I posted earlier this weekend about struggling with anxiety and needing to quit smoking and how that makes it SO much harder to quit. But i feel confident that I can do this. I know that it is just dragging me down and making my life so much worse, making my anxiety worse. I am a non-smoker starting now! I've read the EasyWay and will continue reading it and trying to "re-brainwash" myself. This isn't going to be easy but my plan is to keep myself busy, go to the gym and remember that I am FREE! I've lurked around here for a while now and it is so encouraging to see all of your stories and successes. I can't wait to enjoy all of the benefits of being a non-smoker.

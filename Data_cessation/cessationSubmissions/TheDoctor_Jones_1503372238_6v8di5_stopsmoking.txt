It's been 2 1/2 days and I'm about to break

I smoked cigs for about 3 years and then switched to vaping. I have been vaping for about 4 years. My wife and I are trying to save up for a house so we have limited "fun spending money" and most of mine goes towards vape juice. I'm sick of being tied down and broke to this addiction, but at the same time, I honestly love nicotine. 

I vaped the last of my ejuice this weekend and have been nicotine free since. There are times throughout the day that I would have a craving, but I was able to handle it. But today was the worst. Work was stressful, I was extremely tired and drinking coffee was just a trigger for me. I'm actually depressed at the thought of never having nicotine again. I'm so close to buying more vape juice **one more time** in an attempt to help me get the edge off and trying to spread it out as long as I can. I heard small doses here and there help with quitting. 
I'm just worried if I do that then I'll give in completely and keep doing it. 

I've been a long time lurker and I just wanted to vent. Any and all advice would be appreciated!

101 days

Yesterday evening I was having dinner with friends and I realized that I had just passed 100 days of not smoking - it's become such a distant memory that I did not even register how fast these days passed. My sudden realization felt amazing and I celebrated with a non-alcoholic beer (since yesterday also marked 99 days without alcohol - today 100!). 

I guess for me quitting smoking/drinking was more of a mental clean-up since I associate quitting these vices with everything that was bad in my life (and left behind) and I had to be prepared to take that step. It was not easy but damn was it worth it. Now that I look back at the past 3 months I see how much everything has improved - I enjoy my life now more than ever and I can say I'm the happiest I've ever been. 

I guess my advice would be this: take each day as it comes - there will be cravings, there will be temptations, but you are stronger than them and you will overcome smoking. To make this effort a bit more visual get a jar and put the money you'd usually spend on cigarettes in there and see how each day you save more and more - then reward yourself by buying something nice (or going out for dinner, or a weekend getaway). 

It will be hard, it will be painful, but it will be worth it.

2nd day and I can barely concentrate

Hi all! I've been lurking here for a few weeks, and saturday was my last day of nicotine. I'm definitely on the younger side (18), but have kept the habit for around a year, and what used to be 1 or 2 a day has turned into 6. I've decided to quit "early", because smokers in my family dont tend to turn 70, but i just find it so hard.

I've been free of nicotine for no more than 40 hours, but the lack of it really affects my concentration and my ability to get shit done.

I know a lot of you have already quit, and my habit hasn't taken a toll on me at all compared to most people on here; but I need advice on activities etc. to drive my thoughts away, because my willpower can only go on for so long

Thanks!

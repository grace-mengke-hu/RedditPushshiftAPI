feeling light headed for the past 2 and a half days

i stopped smoking two and a half days ago, but since the start of it i have always had this light headed feeling and its rather infuriating. it makes it hard to do anything. i hoped that by at least the second day this would stop but its still there. when i wake up from sleep its not immediately there, after adjusting myself for a bit this light headed feeling hits me.

 i have talked to other people who have quit they didnt really have this issue when they were quitting, so im unsure whether or not i need to go visit a doctor regarding this or not.

in addition i have looked online regarding this and i couldnt really find much. there was a part about how smoking affects the insulin production but im unsure whether its normal for it to last this long. i have also read that it has something to do with oxygen intake but then again im unsure if its normal for it to last this long.

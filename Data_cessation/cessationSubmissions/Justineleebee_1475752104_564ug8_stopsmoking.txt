Day 1.5!

Hey all! 
I've been smoking since I was 16, now 26. Managed to quit for 2 years in my late teens and started again because the guy I was dating smoked. Recently I decided to go back to school and realized I absolutely cannot afford to pay tuition and keep smoking it was one or the other. 
So last night I smoked my last cigarette and slapped on a patch. 

Today will be my first full day smoke free in 5 years. I'm feeling confident, excited even to have this chapter of my life end and my new smoke free college experience begin!

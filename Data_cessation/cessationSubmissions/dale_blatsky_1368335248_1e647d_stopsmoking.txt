1 Year 11 Months, it gets easier...

I was going to wait until I hit the two year mark before I made this post, but I have been seeing some posts that say "fuck, this is terrible, it's been x amount of days or weeks". I was the shittiest quitter ever and I've somehow gotten this far. I was a pack a day smoker for 10 years. I started at the age of 12 and quit at 26.

It hasn't been two years since my last cigarette but it has been almost two years since I was a pack a day smoker.  A lot of people told me that it doesn't get any easier. It does. At some point it will dawn on you that went an entire day without thinking about  a cigarette. It took me a year to get to that point but I got there. You will to.

My Dad died of lung cancer from smoking two packs a day. Shit's ugly. So when I see a subreddit like this, even though I don't know you people personally, I'm proud of you guys for taking this pain in the ass thing on. It's a beast of a mountain to climb but it's doable. You might fuck up here and there but the fact that you're in this process means that you're engaged and care enough to try and get past this.

TL;DR- Fuck cigarettes, this gets easier.

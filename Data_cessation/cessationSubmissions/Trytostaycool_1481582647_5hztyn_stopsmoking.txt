Day 15: Emotions

Sorry guys I've never posted to reddit before so please let me know if I'm braking rules, unspoken or otherwise.

I had my last smoke on Nov. 26. I wanted to quit before I turned 30, and ended up quitting days before. Everything going good, had a bit if a rocky two weeks, but overall not too bad.

Until today. I want to scream, punch stuff, my brain is foggy, but most of all I just want to cry. As a now 30 year old man it's embarrassing, but really all I want to do is sit and cry. I want a smoke soo, bad but I've came this far and IDGAF, I'm not smoking.

So you you might ask "why are you here? Do you just want attention or something?" YES please god yes! Someone tell me I'm going to be ok, give me some support, tell me it was the right choice.

I'm not normally one of those people who need public approval, but today isn't every other day.  My normally reasonable brain is out of the office.

Sorry for the rambling post and somewhat pathetic post. I'm just a man in need.

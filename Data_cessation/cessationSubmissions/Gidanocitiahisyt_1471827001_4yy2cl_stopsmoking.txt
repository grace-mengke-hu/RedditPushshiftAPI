Only 24 hours in; requesting motivation

Hi all. I had my last cigarette about a day ago and don't feel like getting more. I'm finding myself pretty anxious and constantly feeling like something is "missing" (hey, addiction is a bitch).

I've quit a few times before but would always come back after days, or weeks, or months. This time I've decided that I'll allow for no wiggle room. Even a single cigarette or sharing one with a friend of a "special occasion" will be off limits forever, since I clearly can't trust my self.

What things help keep you guys from going back? What do you tell your self when you're having cravings?

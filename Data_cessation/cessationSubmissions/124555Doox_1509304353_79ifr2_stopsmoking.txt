Smoking and low blood pressure?

I've been struggling with low blood pressure and I smoke occasionally, not that much to be honest. I read that smoking even small amounts of tobacco is not linearly correlated to heart disease. In other words, even somking few ciggarettes can result in a heigher blood pressure which can lead to heart problems later in life.

My question: is making your heart rate higher bad when you're struggling with low blood pressure? Are there any studies done on how it might affect people like that? I want to limit and eventually quit smoking but would like to have a completely honest picture as to the risks of smoking.

You are an addict

Something that really helped me was finally seeing what smoking makes you - an addict. Can an alcoholic have "just one drink"? No! Of course not, because you can never have "just one", an addict will always want more and more and more.

I listened to a Hidden Brain (NPR podcast) episode about addiction too - specifically smoking - and one lady said she would tell herself "I am a non-smoker. Why would a non-smoker ever want a cigarette?"

Just some things that have helped and continue to help me. I'm 4 months in and I  never thought I'd get here. You can do it!!

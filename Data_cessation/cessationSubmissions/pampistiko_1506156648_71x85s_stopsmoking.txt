stretching time

i have not yet claimed to stop, but am in a serious cutting down phase. i am stretching the time between cigarettes and am doing pretty well in that respect. changing the habits. from smoking a packet a day i can now go for days without even one, my personal best is five days. at some point soon i am going to set a final quit day after which i will stop smoking all together. i thought for years that being a party smoker was possible, but before i knew it every day was a party. 
that is the most difficult thing though... alcohol... it really is the enemy.

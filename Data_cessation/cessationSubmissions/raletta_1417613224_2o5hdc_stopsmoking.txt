Day 3 is killing me.

Yesterday was a good day. I was occupied most of the day and didn't have much time to think about smoking. I even had a drink with my nonsmoking friends in the evening and didn't smoke. 
Today is different. I am home alone and I should be studying but the only thing in my mind are cigarettes. I can't concentrate and think about buying a pack every 5 min. The only thing that is stopping me right now is the though "you can wait a little more.if it wont get better you can buy them later" Help.

Edit: I fucked up. :/ Starting again on Friday.

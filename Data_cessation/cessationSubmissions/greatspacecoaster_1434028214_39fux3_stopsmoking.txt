Didn't smoke last night, feel like I smoked last night.

Had a few drinks to say goodbye to a friend who's moving away, and definitely *wanted* a cig but didn't smoke one. This morning my head is killing me as if I'd smoked half a pack and that weird flavor is in my mouth. I definitely did not sleep-smoke, so we can rule that out. :) Whats going on??

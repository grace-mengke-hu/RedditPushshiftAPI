72,000 Cigarettes (And I was more than half-way there)

That's how many a pack-a-day smoker inhales over a decade. That is if my math is correct. I tend to flop when it comes to unit conversion.

Just a public reminder to myself. I think I have a fever. A stray cat scratched me almost a week ago. Wondering if I have rabies now. The Ebolavirus outbreak is freaking me out - what if it was transmitted to NA? 

I'm a little scared to fall asleep, can't lie.
 Also still insanely hungry.

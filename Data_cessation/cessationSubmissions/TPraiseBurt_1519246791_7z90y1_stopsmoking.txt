Need help

Need help. I have tried quit smoking. I do not smoke while at work. But when I come home at evening my wife is smoking and I cannot go on with my plan not to smoke. I am unable to get out of this ring. We cannot settle a date to quit together, but I cannot go on like this. I want to quit, but I cannot leave her alone in the other room and stay alone.. What is your advise?

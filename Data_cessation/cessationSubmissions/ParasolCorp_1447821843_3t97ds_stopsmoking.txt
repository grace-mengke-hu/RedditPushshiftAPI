Day 1. Oh crap.

I told myself I would quit smoking when i had a kid. That didn't happen. I also told myself I would for many other reasons. Those never happened. Well, i've been a smoker for almost 12 years. I turn 30 soon. Damnit, I'm going to quit before I turn 30. I'm sick of this nonsense. If it weren't for lurking in this subreddit for over a year now, making excuses to myself, i never would've worked my way up to this point. Ya'll are awesome.

Two weeks!

Its like a relief to get here. Symptoms are getting better except for the cough and some chest back pain related to it. I may have a cold, but i read somewhere that when you quit assume all your symptoms are due to quitting for at least a month. Can't say I haven't thought about it, but I know now that it may always be a decision to not smoke. Quitting is painful, which is probably good for me, because I never want to put myself through this again.

How do you quit smoking when you live with a smoker?

I've been smoking for a little over 12 years and I'm ready to quit. I just celebrated 2 years clean from heroin and alcohol and I've been stubbornly clinging to cigarettes because they're the only vice I have left. BUT I have my 3 year old daughter every other weekend and I hate smoking around her, or even just smelling like smoke. I'm a musician and singer and know I'm killing my voice. I hate the way I smell. I hate how much money I spend on killing myself. I feel ready - until I remember, I'm fucked.

I quit heroin by completely removing myself from heroin and people who use heroin. If someone was shooting up in front of me regularly, or had bags laying out all over the place, I know I would not have been able to quit. So how do I quit smoking living with a chain smoker? We smoked outside right up until it dropped below 30 and now that slippery slope has resulted in us smoking inside. All the time. I love him, but he is NOT ready to quit - he loves smoking. He jokes about how he'll die of lung cancer. He says he'll smoke outside but he's stubborn and always ends up lighting up on the couch. But I want to quit, regardless. It just feels like I'm setting myself up for failure though.

 I quit for 7 days cold turkey earlier this year, but had just that one fleeting fuck it moment. He was even super respectful and had the packs/lighters put up - but I knew they were in the house and I just snatched one. Fast forward 8 months and I'm back at a pack a day.

Has anyone quit while living with a smoker? How do you quit when that visual cue is incessant? Does hypnotherapy work? HALP

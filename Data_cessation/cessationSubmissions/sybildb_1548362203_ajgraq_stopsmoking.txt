Smoked my last cigarette today!

I started smoking at 15 and had to quit at 17 after being caught. I got a vape to help my cravings and have been using it since but i always felt like i was craving cigarettes still. I smoked a cigarette today and while i was, i realised that i didn’t enjoy it, the pleasure of smoking a cigarette was gone. even that hand movement and lighting the cigarette, i used to miss that, and now i don’t. it was this odd revelation inside me that told me what’s the point of this? it’s a great feeling and i for sure know now i won’t be smoking any more cigarettes.

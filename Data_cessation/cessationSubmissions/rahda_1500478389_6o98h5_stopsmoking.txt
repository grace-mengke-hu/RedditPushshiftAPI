Proud but down

Getting close to the five month mark and near 500 dollars saved and near 1500 unsmoked cigs! That last number really grabs me. Imagine a pile of 1500 cigs that could have been in my lungs!

I find I understand why people relapse even after all this time. Because I still think of having one sometimes. Different triggers do it. I feel slightly depressed and anxious and I won't take meds for it or start smoking again. It is sad the cig won't help. There is no magic pill for any of these feels. Everyone had their own journey. Just having kind of a hard time with life right now. And when I feel up against the wall a cigarette beckons. It will do no good and will make my feelings worse about things. But ugh, the struggle sometimes to exist is hard and smokes filled that hole up with something. 
I'm proud of myself. I just feel a little down lately. I am a healer and have tools to help. I just don't know what I need honestly. An entire move and life reform which seems daunting and impossible on my best days.

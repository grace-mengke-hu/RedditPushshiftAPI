Thank you, everyone.

After about a month of getting my mind right, getting my wife on board, seeing your inspiring posts in here, and a week or so of reading Carr's book with my wife, I am sitting here typing this up after we just extinguished our last doses of poisonous nicotine. 

Thank the you all for being an inspiration and for recommending The Easy Way. I look forward to waking up in the morning with over half of the nicotine in my body already dissipated. 

As Mr. Carr said, "YIPPEE"!

Trying to quit.

Hello, I'm 17 years old, and I have been smoking for over a year now. Every now and then I quit for a little while but get right back into it. I am now into my 3rd attempt at quitting and I have gone down from a pack every two days to about 4-5 cigarettes a day. That may not be much to anyone else, but it's seems to be an improvement!

I realized I needed to quit when I was outside with a couple friends and we were throwing a Frisbee and I was winded every time it came to me. I used to be very healthy and now that I've lost that, it hurts. 

The reason I began smoking was when I moved out for about a month to live with a friend and it all went down from there. I was smoking a lot as a deterrent to my anxiety that I got from my family. My family is a huge mess and everyday is a wild ride that sends me into psychological hell and back. Smoking to me, is the only thing that has been the same. It never changes and has always been there for me. 

I just need some support in changing my lifestyle. My teachers and friends smell it on me and complain, and I honestly can't keep washing my clothes EVERYDAY. Sorry for my terrible English, and thanks in advance.  

EDIT: Okay, so day one with officially no cigarettes. I have already chewed my finger nails to shreds and I'm trying to find something to get my mind off the addiction....

Day 1... again....

I've been smoking on and off for 24 years. I quit for 6 years, smoked for 6 months, quit for a year and a half... then started again 2 years ago like an idiot.

This is it. I've had more than enough and I want to be done with it. I finished my last pack last night and I refuse to buy more.

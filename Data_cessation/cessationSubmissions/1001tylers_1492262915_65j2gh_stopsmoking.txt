Back to Work :(

About 4.5 days
Just on my way to work in the AM
Haven't worked yet since I quit
Already caught myself checking my pockets ugh
I feel like I will have trouble keeping it together today

Even just the bus being late (as always) made me want a smoke.

Hehe being on the bus with all the morning people is making me want a smoke lol

I know work is going to be worse as I work a very high stress job. 

Let's see how this goes.

Update:
So it's mt first break and I caught myself thinking... ah thank god I can finally have a smoke...then I remembered I'm not smoking hahahahaha

Now I'm bored on said break with nothing to do lol

update:
made it through work today. Super proud of myself.

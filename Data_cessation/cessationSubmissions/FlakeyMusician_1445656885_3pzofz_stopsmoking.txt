Over a week of no smoking!

I'd be lying if I said it wasn't tough every once in a while, but I feel way better than I thought I would so soon after the quit. It's been cold turkey, a moment at a time. I've found myself lost during break time at work, but otherwise the transition has been fairly smooth. No coughing yet, but I'm just waiting. My wife quit the day after I did is she is just coughing up a storm. A bit jealous, actually! 

All in all, I'm feeling great.

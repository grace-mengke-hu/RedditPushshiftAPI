Today I relapsed

The holidays are tough times. It’s mustve been a month or so since I stopped my two packs a day habit 

The good news is I know why i relapsed. Ended up in a nasty verbal fight yesterday with an aquientance in my friend’s group which caused a split between us. Also ever since I visited New York last week back from my work I stopped working out, meditating and pretty fucked my routine.

Definitely won’t let it happen again. Got to make sure my healthy coping mechanisms are in check. 


How about you friends? It’s almost 2018, how is the fight ?

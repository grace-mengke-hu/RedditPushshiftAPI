Just checking in- 20 days smoke free!

The storm is over- This felt impossible to say twenty days ago but I think I’m officially “addicted” to not smoking! 

Each time I’ve been stressed since my quit and have had the urge to smoke I’ve been able to overcome the actual addiction and mind tricks- and it gives me an even better buzz than lighting up. 

The “buzz” of being in control and not relying on cigarettes is so empowering I don’t think I’ll ever go back. I wont go back.

How long until I can call myself a non-smoker?

I’m 18 days smoke free and I’ve hit the point where I can confidently say that I will never smoke again. But has it been long enough to say I’m not a smoker? It feels right to say “I don’t smoke” but yesterday I said something about when I “used to smoke” and it felt funny since it hasn’t really been that long to talk about in the past tense.

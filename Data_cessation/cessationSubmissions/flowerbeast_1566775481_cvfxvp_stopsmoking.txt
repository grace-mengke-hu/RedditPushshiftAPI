I started smoking when I was 11 years old. (Today is a week as a nonsmoker for me!)

I didn’t think this was possible. I have tried to quit probably 20 plus times, but didn’t realize I was approaching it the complete wrong way. I’m 27, an active cyclist, vegetarian, hiker, etc. and could just feel cigs killing me. A few days into my quit I read Allen Carr’s book and realized that was how I felt about cigarettes as well. It’s all in our minds. We can do anything if we set our sights on it and really give an earnest try. 
I never believed in myself before now, but I know that this is finally the time I quit. I feel incredible, and happy, and proud. I don’t feel like I’ve lost a thing. 

I’m a chef and my friends smoke and my mom smokes—even being around them doesn’t bother me. Somehow I haven’t even experienced a single craving. 

Thanks for listening ❤️

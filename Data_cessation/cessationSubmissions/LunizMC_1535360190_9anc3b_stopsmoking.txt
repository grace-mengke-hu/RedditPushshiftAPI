Two years baby!

Easy this giving up lark.  Don't think I'll ever forget this place though.  Keep the NRT, I never needed it, but never take the support of other people who understand the struggle you go through.  Gold dust, completely.  Take it from me, a 30-a-day smoker, you don't need it, you never did.  Keep giving up, it's well worth it.

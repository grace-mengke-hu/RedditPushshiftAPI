Help! 30 Days clean and still craving, just mental addiction?

This is honestly the worst. I finally decided to quit cold turkey after a year, have horrible withdrawals, can’t concentrate on work or even hobbies, and it hasn’t gotten any better now 30 days later. It’s so easy to say no to cravings, it was even that easy to say no when I first quit, but I can’t deny the fact that I still want it, or, at least my brain does, and badly. I was doing so well and was so proud of myself for powering through but now I’m worried I completely fucked up my brain’s reward system and now knowing that makes me feel good and numbs my depression and anxiety, I’m concerned I may always be mentally addicted to it.


I am NOT considering relapsing, I’ve gone this far and goddammit I can go 12x further. I’m just saying, this fucking sucks and I’m worried I’m pretty much bound to start smoking later in life again because I’ll always know how much better my life felt with it. (Even if this was just an illusion of chemicals, my brain doesn’t know the difference.)

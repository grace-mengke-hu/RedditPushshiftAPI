Need Help or at least some new ideas...

Well I have been a lurker for awhile now. I'm 38 years old and have been a smoker since 18. I actually quit for a year and a half and unfortunately went right back to the habit. I know I have a huge nicotine addiction because I also dip when playing sports. I played pro baseball for 5 years and picked up these bad habits. 
  I usually smoke in the morning with coffee (my favorite time of day) at work , while driving. I know I have to quit and I want to. I have tried books but they have been no help. I really just want to finish this pack and be done with them. At least that is the plan. 
  Does anyone have any advice about getting over the oral fixation. Gum really hasn't worked. I have even tried a mouthpiece so I can chew on it... all that did was made me look like an asshole. 
   I guess I'm just ranting over frustration I know I just have to stop and avoid the triggers. Reading others success has me optimistic. Wish me luck.

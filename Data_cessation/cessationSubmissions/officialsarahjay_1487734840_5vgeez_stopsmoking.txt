An Introduction

Hey!

Ok so we're among friends, I don't worry about being judged. But I picked up smoking in August 2016, I fluctuated from two to eight a day depending on my stress (diagnosed generalized anxiety disorder and depression, unmedicated). I won't lie and say I didn't start smoking for the appetite suppression, I totally did. 

Lately I've been on 3 a day and I had enough. I went to get gas and I said, "oh, I can get a pack of lights and taper off" but then I decided no, this is a bad habit and it has to go. 

So I quit today on my lunch break. All out of smokes and no desire to buy more. 

I know this is gonna be a tough journey, but I hope it won't be too painful. I believe I can beat this. I know my strength. And you guys make a really supportive community too!

But hi. I'm Sarah. Seven hours smoke free and going.

Damn dreams

So here I am, 14 days in and last night I kept dreaming that everyone in my dreams smoked, even people I know in real life who don't.  I kept bumming one off people and saying one won't hurt me.  It felt so real and when I woke up this morning I thought I would have to reset my badge.

Does smoking in dreams become more frequent the longer you go?  So far this is only my second one since quitting that I can remember.

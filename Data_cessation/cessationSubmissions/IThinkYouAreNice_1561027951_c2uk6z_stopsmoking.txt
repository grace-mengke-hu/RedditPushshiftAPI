My first day smoke free

It's been one day since I smoked. I feel better. I am fighting the urges that last about 45 seconds at a time. As long as I drink lots of water during those urges I should be safe.

I find the myQuitTimeFree app to be a great help. When I click the HELP button it gives me a positive message that reinforces my resolve to be a non smoker.  The message now says:

"INSPIRATION

Never again will you take inventory of smoking paraphernalia before you leave your home or office."

Sounds good to me!  What a relief I am not a smoker.

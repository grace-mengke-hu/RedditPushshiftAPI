Plz Help! I want to quit before my birthday next week!

Hi r/stopsmoking, I have been trying to quit for a long time now. I have read the Allen Carr book multiple times and even seen the webinar. I usually do this in the night. I feel pumped and ready to quit but by next morning I go back to my foul ways. 

I think I understand my addiction but by morning my brain starts saying not today, let's do it tomorrow. I feel light headed and before I know it I'm smoking. It's like all the finer points of the book and the instructions go out the window.

What am I doing wrong? I want to quit so badly. My birthday is coming up next week and I want to be a non smoker by then and for the rest of my life.

I want a flair that goes beyond a day. Plz help!

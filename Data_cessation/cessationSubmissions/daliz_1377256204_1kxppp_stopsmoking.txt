Traveling and quitting. I need an advice.

Hello /r/stopsmoking!

Ten days from now, I'll be on a plane for a 15 hours flight and then I'll stay some months far from home.

I'm 30 years old and I've been a smoker for 10 years... and I really want to quit before leaving because this long vacation is going to be my little "escape from reality" and relax experience. And I'm really committed and I've never been so certain to be able to do it.

There is only one problem: when I've quit a couple of years ago, few days later I've been suffering of the typical "quitter's flu", with bad coughing, fever and breathing difficulties. And I fear that if I quit now, I will have such health problems for my travel, which would turn it into a bad experience.

If you were me, what would you do? Would you go cold-turkey right now doing your best to "purify" your lungs in these 10 days? 

I could really use an advice from someone who quit and suffered of the same symptoms!  Thank you!

Doing it this time

I've been a smoker for 13 years, about a pack a day for the last 5-10.  "Quit" for six months once, but fell back into it after starting a stressful job with co-workers who smoked.  Last night (after midnight, so technically today), I smoked the last cigarette that I intend to smoke for the rest of my life.


I've tried e-cigs before, but they were too similar to a real cigarette for me, without quite scratching that itch all the way.  This time I am trying the gum, but I am also coming at it with a different attitude;  I am not expecting the cessation aid to solve my problem for me.  I'm not "switching to" gum like I tried to do with the e-cigs, I am quitting.  I'm tired of having terrible skin, I'm tired of me and everything I own smelling like an ashtray, I'm tired of literally burning so much money, and I'm tired of coughing up nasty shit all the time.


So here goes nothing.  Wish me luck.

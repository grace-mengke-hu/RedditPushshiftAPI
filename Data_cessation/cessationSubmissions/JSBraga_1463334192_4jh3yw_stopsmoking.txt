F*******CK I REALLY NEED ONE!!!!!!

This is REALLY stupid. But because of a stupid sports competiton, I REALLY need a f*cking cirgarette!!!!!! My rival team is going to win the championship and I can't stand hearing them cheer all around my house (since I live 15 minutes away from their stadium). Usually this would be nothing that would make me mad. My own team isn't even playing to win the championship anymore. It's stupid that I'd be mad because of it. But I've stopped smoking so recently and I don't want to cave... and that makes me even madder!!!!!!!! GAH!

I'm not going to have one. I don't want one. I've been chewing on a toothpick for an hour now. And honestly, just venting is making me feel better already.

I completely decided that I'm not going to have a cigarette while writing to vent out my urge to pick on a cigarette.

I'm so glad to be a part of this community...

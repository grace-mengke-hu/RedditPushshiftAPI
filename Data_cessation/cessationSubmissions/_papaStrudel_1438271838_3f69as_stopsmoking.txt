Third times the charm?

Hi All,

I decided to quit smoking (for the third time) today. Past times have ranged from 3 - 6 months but I've always relapsed. I guess I'm posting here to hold myself accountable.

Any tips or tricks anyone recommends for the first few days to get over the hump?

Thanks for reading.

Ending of day 4

It's going to end soon and I'm feeling fucking lonely and mad at the world. It's even worse than day 3. I mean this quitting ain't even that bad until some shit just triggers me.

What's happening is I'm really confused about my social life. I'm just so anxious around people and I feel like most of them are idiots.. (well quitting makes these feelings way crazier than they really are)...

My sinuses are also really blocked wtf why? It's like smoking masked my fucked up sinuses and fucked them up at the same time... What the actual fuck

I can't get myself to learn something new on guitar or learn programming, it's like I spend to much time waiting for the perfect moment but now I'm irritable as hell and tired of it all.. Gonna try to sleep lol.

Help

Sorry for whining. But I reread Alan Carr's book, but failed again. I'm going to reread it, and set a new quit date for this weekend. I need to remember that life is equally stressful with and without cigarettes (once the nicotine withdraw is gone.) I like a lot of the things Alan Carr says, but I also wonder if there is actual scientific proof for his claims. This doubting haunted me as I read his book, and I think contributed to my failure.

Questions about Allen Carr's book

I've been reading Allen Carr's book today as per a lot of suggestions on this site, and have some questions for those of you have been successful in the long term (1 year plus). The one thing I am most concerned about is being in the right frame of mind to successfully quit for good. Carr talks about needing to rid yourself of the brainwashing before attempting to quit, and knowing/feeling that you will never smoke again when you actually quit.

The demon in my head is trying hard to get me to cave in, but I'm fighting hard and have not yet failed. It is just that I currently feel afraid that I am not fully committed right now. This is in turn making me anxious about my long term success. Any suggestions?
What has your experience been since quitting? Do you feel like Carr's points ring true?

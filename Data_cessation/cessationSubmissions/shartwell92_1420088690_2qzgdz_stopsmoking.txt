Just smoked my last cigarette.

It's time to start 2015 off right. I've managed to refrain from smoking 4 months this year before relapsing...so i know I can do it!

I only smoke when I visit my parents on the weekends so any tips on how to reprogram my brain seeing how I ONLY smoke or have cravings when visiting.

Cheers to 2015!

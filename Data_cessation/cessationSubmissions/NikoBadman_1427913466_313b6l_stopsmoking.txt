Been smoking more weed lately

I haven't been smoking a single cigarette for 85 days, but i have noticed that my craving for joints has skyrocketed in no time. I smoke more joints and i have more cravings plus i get the cravings on times i never did before (when i wake up in the morning i feel like getting high, when i get home from work etc)

I mix my joints with a little tobacco (cause i mostly smoke hash) i've started to think that maybe the dose if nicotine is what "tricks" me into smoking more joints after i quitted cigarettes.

Has anyone else had the same experiences?

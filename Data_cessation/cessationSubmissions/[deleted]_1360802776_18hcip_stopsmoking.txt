Just to get it off my chest

I've never posted her before, in fact, I've July now just found this subreddit. I'll probably never post here again, and I'm not really looking for anything other than a place to vent.


I started smoking when I was 13,and I smoked for five years, and to be honest I enjoyed it, I've always enjoyed it, and I never stopped enjoying it.


I quit on 21/05/11, so I'm not really that far off of a year, and I really want a cigarette. Chances are I won't have one, even though I've got a pack in my wardrobe upstairs, but I've been desperate for hours, for some reason, I have no idea why, because I haven't really craved a cigarette in months.

I don't really expect much from this, but, like I said, I just needed to say it. I have no idea how this subreddit works, so maybe some advice, comfort, or just somebody vent back? I'll listen to it all.


Thanks to all you Redditors out there that a re strong enough to leave it all behind.

EDIT: thanks guys, this was more about just putting everything in to words, but I do appreciate the advice.

I didn't have a cigarette, so roll on May!

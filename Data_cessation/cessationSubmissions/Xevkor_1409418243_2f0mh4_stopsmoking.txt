Today I ran my first ever 10k run.

Roughly 6 months ago is when I decided I was gonna stop smoking, I'm not 100% sure how this sub feels about vaping, but I picked it up to ween myself off of nicotine. 

Today I ran my very first run ever. I didn't do a 5k, I went all the way to a 10k with hills, obstacles, all of it. I finished it in roughly two hours. 

6 months ago, I was a 2 pack a day smoker, and had been for about 5 years. 6 months ago, I could have NEVER ran a 10k, a 5k, of even walk up stairs without being winded. Today I finally stepped up and did something I had never done before, and I succeeded.Wasn't the fastest, wasn't the slowest, but I finished, and that matters.

To anyone who is quitting cold turkey, the vapor way, anyway as long as you're attempting to quit. The possibility is there for you all. Don't give in, the cravings will pass, and a new life, a healthier life is ahead of you.

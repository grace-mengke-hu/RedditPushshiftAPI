I'm scared to start again and fail.

I've been at this numerous times. I think my streak has been 14 days. I'm doing something wrong. And I'm not sure how to do it right. Of course there's not going to be one sentence that will change my life here, but I need some comments that kick me in the butt. Some stories. Something.

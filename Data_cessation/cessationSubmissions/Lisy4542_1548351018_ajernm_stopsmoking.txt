Oh What a Relief It Is!

As I’m walking out of Starbucks this morning I see a lady smoking in her beautiful Audi.  I felt sad for her and was reminded how trapped I felt at times being a smoker.  You have conversations with your self why am I smoking as you enjoy that puff.  I’m greaful that I’m on day 18 and no longer struggle with these thoughts.

Day 2. What helps you?

Today is day 2 for me. Its going ok so far, but right now I really want one. Im not going to - but its all i think about! Its almost like I am trying to convince myself of why it isn't so bad, or that i could even get by with just one a day - just to avoid this constant empty feeling of something I need and cant have. Does this get easier? What helps you forget that you want one or helps the craving pass? Its like I'm reminded every five minutes that I need one. Its difficult because I have an hour and half commute from work - which is now spent gripping the wheeling until my knuckles turn white. (I come here at least every two hours for support and reminders. So thanks!)

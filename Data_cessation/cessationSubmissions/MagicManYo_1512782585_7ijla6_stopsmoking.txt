I'd like to thank this subreddit

Your motivation kept me going smoke-free. Seeing all your guys' posts along with your comments on how to resist urges and how better you feel after quitting strengthened my will power. Especially those joyful posts where someone mentions how long they've been smoke free. (:

I don't think I would've been able to get this far if it weren't for the great support present here.

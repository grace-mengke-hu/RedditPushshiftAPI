Two Weeks!

Just passed my two week mark 21 minutes ago. I've been using an eCig, but each day I use it less and less. I haven't even touched it so far today! I honestly never though this day would come and reading this subreddit every day for the last month or so was exactly what I needed. 

Thanks everyone!

4 and half months smoke free, but...


 I still havent smoked, not even a single cig. I'm going 4 and half months clean.

 I still get a  nerve/muscle pinching pain or sometimes a slight burning pain  at both sides of ribs (but not at same rime) and upper back area (more light at back area), and a pinching pain in upper chest, all these symptoms i mentioned are not constant theyre only off and on during the day or some days not at all.

Note that i have done a blood test 3 times, and an ultra sound around stomach and rib and a stress test (heart) 
It turned out good.

Ive noticed that when i have a couple beers and get lightly drunk the day after my left side of my chest will feel like its heavy to breathe in and it will last till nightime.

Maybe i need to give my body more time before i drink? 
I'm not sure why but ive never had this problem when i was drinking before i quit smoking.

Does anyone experience anything similar?

Btw. I was thinking about smoking weed but i figured it gives poeple the same carbon monoxide, what about weed edibles is that the same or a much safer way?

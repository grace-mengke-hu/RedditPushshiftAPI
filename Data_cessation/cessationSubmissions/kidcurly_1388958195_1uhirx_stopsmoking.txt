I just smoked 2 cigarettes afte 4days being clean, damn.

I just smoked 2cigarretes after 4days of being clean.

I brought back my girlfriend to the train station and when I got home I saw that my parents left.
My dad left a box of cigarretes and I could't resist to take one after that I smoked another one.
Now I feel pretty depressed beceause I took them.
I guess this is a lesson but im kinda embarrassed beceause my dad was so happy I was quitting.
So here I am at day one again...

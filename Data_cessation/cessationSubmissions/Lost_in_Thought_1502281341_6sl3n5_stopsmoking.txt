Breaking the morning routine

So I've decided, for myself, that I need to quit. Been smoking 8 years now (started when I was 20...Yeah) and I'm tired of it. Tired of trying to hide the habit from my coworkers and family, tired of spending money to kill myself, tired of this incessant cough, tired of being held captive to my addiction. 

But it's hard. It's real hard. 

I recognize that a lot of it is breaking old habits. I've taken week long + break before, but it was always when spending time with family, in vacation, doing other things to keep me busy. But removing the habitual triggers in my daily life is rough. 

I smoke in the mornings and evenings. I am to be able to manage the evenings alright, I went all last night without a smoke. But I feel lost in the morning. Today I woke up, made coffee, went for a run, and then tried and failed to resist the urge to have a smoke. I feel dirty. 

I'll try again tomorrow morning. Anyone have tips to help fight these morning cravings?

Never again

I will never smoke again. I can quit on the weekend no problem. I get tired but it is not a problem. But when Monday rolls around, I reach for the cigs. 

I think part of it is due to the medication I take for ADHD. It calms me down, allows me to focus, yet there is a period of anxiety in there when a cigarette is all I can think about. Oddly, I have taken it previously when I wasn't smoking. I am back there starting NOW.

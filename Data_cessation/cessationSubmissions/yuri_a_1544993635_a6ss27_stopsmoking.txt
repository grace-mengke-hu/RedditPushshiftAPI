I Need Help! Relapsed Over a Dozen Times

I have been smoking cigarettes and pot for over 6 years now.  I'm 27 and have given it multiple tries but each time I couldn't hold the urge and relapsed.  

I have tried cold turkey - failed!  I have tried exercising - Failed!  Tried healthy eating but none seems to work for me.  I even sought help from a doc and I couldn't.  I tried the Nico strips and Nico gums but all crashed. Tried the recommended apps and watched over a dozen videos.  None helped!!  

I'm totally hopeless and depressed now. My health is at all time worse and I don't see a fix. I'm overweight by over 15 kg and have a really hectic lifestyle. I usually over think and end up smoking to combat the so called stress. I feel like a trash and see no good coming my way.  This is slow poison and I'm dying everyday.  

I really need some help but not sure what that would be.. May be I need someone who can ask me at end of the day and keep me motivated. Cause my self-esteem is at all time low.  I really get anxious and often feel the need to talk to someone. But it turns out I don't have very many friends nor my gf has been of any help. She just doesn't seem to care enough. But I know I'm hurting myself and I want to do this. 

I really wish I too could post my story life do many of us but I have not been able to make it.  

Idk what to do.  I'm lost and I m helpless.

Help me quit for real this time

I quit every week. I've been smoking for almost 10 years and for the past 2 months. I would tell myself okay time to quit then I wouldn't buy smokes all week long. 


Bam once I walk out of the beer store it's like a habit and I grab smokes at the gas station and end up finishing that pack the next day and proceed to buy 2 or 3 more packs until I repeat my process of quitting for 5 days and starting up again.


I'm on day 3 right now

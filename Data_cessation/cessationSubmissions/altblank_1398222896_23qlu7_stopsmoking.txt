3 months :)

as the title says, so it goes... haven't smoked for 3 months now, and it feels mostly great.

springtime's in the air, and i see an increase in cravings sometimes. but in the big picture, it's going smoothly. i do occasionally think i've got to stop and take a smoke break for old times' sake, but don't even want to really go there. i don't believe that one smoke will take me back to the abyss, but really don't want to test that theory out.

i'm still pretty much short of breath, and i don't quite know what's up. haven't been to a doctor yet of course, and will probably schedule a checkup sometime in the next few weeks.

i don't get as many colds as i did before i quit, and the intensity is much lesser too.

my voice becomes hoarse after around 3 or 4mins of continuous talking, and i have no idea why this happens. again, something to bring up with the doctor.

so there's that.

it seriously gets easier.

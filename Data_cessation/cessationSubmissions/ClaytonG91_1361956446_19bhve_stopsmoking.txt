that disgusting stink 

I noticed it on sunday at work when a manager who often sneaks out of work to go smoke came in through the back door and said hi to me it was disgusting...


but today (tuesday the 26th) I could smell it on everyone and it just freaking stunk. It was so utterly disgusting to have to smell that on people. What's worse in my opinion is that I work in a kitchen and I could smell that nasty stink on people who are working with people's food or dropping off plates at people's tables like right in your face. If i had to eat and my waiter came up to me and stunk of smoke I might ask for a new waiter... I've worked in this industry since i was 16 I know how rampant smoking is in the food industry and for years i was okay with it, while smoking i was pissed that i even had to ask for a smoke break, but now... now i understand why it is really becoming banned. (at my work it is technically against the rules to go out to smoke unless you are expressly off the clock and using one of your 15 minute breaks but blah blah everyone does it can't punish them all you'll never get them to stop etc etc etc) 

anyways... I just thought i'd mention that I can't believe I thought that stupid stink wasn't noticeable. I mean, i work in a kitchen, it just rained here in Az so that means plants are flowering (that's right it's winter and we get flowers fuck off with your damn snow i'm keeping my shorts and tee shirts) so my nose is stuffed i can smell food and then out of nowhere BAM that fucking disgusting nose wrinkling stench.

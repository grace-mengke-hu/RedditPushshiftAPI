Quit 20 days ago. Are these symptoms normal?

I did the Alan Carr Book the wrong way as I started with patches then stopped using them half way through reading. Then again I still got the underlining message from the book. 

Apart from the odd minor pangs I've been fine. I've been able to drink, and not light up, or ask for a cigarette. 

Up until this Monday just gone I had was constantly bloated, and my bowel movements were quite few and far between. 
I'm also incredibly tired at the moment, yet when I attempt to sleep I lay in my bed for hours unable to sleep.

I have also noticed that my breath in the past week has begun to become horrendous and quite noticeable. I've started on correcting this the best way I can, although the girl I was seeing recently has lost all interest.. and I believe this to be the issue. I'm not too bothered as I'd rather be smoke free, and the symptoms can be resolved another way, and will disappear.

Remember your last failure?

I remember my last failure like it was yesterday. After my longest attempt to quit, i finally did it and am still going strong. A few moments ago, I was about to fail again. So i started reading stories here and I feel better to see others sharing the same pain I am in. But the real reason i am even writing this is to keep my fingers busy for a few minutes and take my mind away from idleness. As i start to type this sentence, my craving that i had 5 minutes ago reduced. I had typed some long wall of text but replaced it all with this sentence. 



**TL:DR** - Am typing this to keep my fingers busy. Read it to keep your mind busy. It might just save you that one relapse.

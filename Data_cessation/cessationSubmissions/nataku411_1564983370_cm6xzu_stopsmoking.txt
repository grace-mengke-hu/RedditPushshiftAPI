Going to take the plunge soon.

I've been off cigarettes for around a week now, and once my vape juice is out I'm going to cold turkey.  I'm going through a lot of anxiety and intense depression and a whole heap of other stuff, and I always told myself I'd wait until things are less stressful.  Well things aren't likely to get better anytime soon so I'm just gonna do it.  Feeling extremely alone so I thought I'd at least tell some internet people.  Thank you and I'm going to keep trying my best.

Day 2: quitting as a fraternity brother

Hey guys this is my first post to this sub. Yesterday, I made the conscious decision to quit smoking. For the past year, since I joined my fraternity, I've become a pack-a-day smoker. I never even took a puff in high school. I don't blame my fraternity because I made the choice to smoke myself, but the fraternity presented me with ample opportunity to smoke.  Recently smoking was banned during parties (I actually facilitated this) and my first party as a non smoker is tomorrow. Hopefully I'll be able to fight the cravings and pull through. Smoking is not something my parents are okay with and so far I've been able to hide it from them. I'm tired of lying, tired of spending money I shouldn't be spending, and I'm tired of slowly poisoning myself.

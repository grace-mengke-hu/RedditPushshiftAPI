Does your SO smoke? If so, how do you handle it?

Haven't touched a cigarette in almost 4 months, still going strong. My boyfriend however still smokes and he's not planning on quitting anytime soon. He's actually quite fond of it. Sometimes this drives me mad. 

Not only because he's smoking around me, but also because the fact that he doesn't acknowledge the dangers of smoking makes me feel like I quit for nothing. It's hard to stay optimistic about quitting around someone who doesn't feel the same way. 

Is anyone else in a similar situation? How do you handle this?

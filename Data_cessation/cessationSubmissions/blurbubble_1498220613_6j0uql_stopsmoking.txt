Quitting this weekend after 6 years - need suggestions!

Hello everybody, I'm a 23 year old smoker who started smoking when she was 17. 
I've been trying to quit on and off for 6 months but despite making progress I always fail - I smoke around 10 cigarettes a day.

This weekend most of my friends are out of town/busy so I thought it would be the perfect time to quit for good - no parties, no alcohol. I'm tired of feeling tired, running out of breath, and wasting money.

The major problem I have faced is my emotions - I am a very emotional person, and I smoke mainly as a form of self medication to control them and feel better and more relaxed.

Any suggestions on the best way to quit for good? I was thinking of setting aside the money I use to buy cigarettes to buy myself a pair of shoes I really wanted, but I would really appreciate help on how to deal with emotions without running to smoke.

Thank you for your help!

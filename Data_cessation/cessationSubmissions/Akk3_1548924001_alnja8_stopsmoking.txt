10 days in and I'm noticing one thing I don't see mentioned

People usually mention their physical health benefits, but I don't see a lot of people mentioning sociability. I'm currently 10 days in and I'm noticing that I am much more sociable and less socially anxious. Is there a correlation? Did you guys feel anything like this too?

Also, you guys are awesome. This community is awesome and is making this much easier

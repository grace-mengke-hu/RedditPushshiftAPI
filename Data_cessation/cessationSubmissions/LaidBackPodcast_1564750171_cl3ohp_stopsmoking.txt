Peoples experience with NRT?

I'm having a harder time quitting at the moment, and I'm looking for help. What are peoples experience using NRT gum and patches? For some context I smoke about 10 per day. Did it help you significantly? Did NRT have any side effects that you think are notable? Thanks for any help, I love how supportive this community can be!

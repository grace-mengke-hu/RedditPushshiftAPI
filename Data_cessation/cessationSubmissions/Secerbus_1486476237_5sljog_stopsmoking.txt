COPD first symptoms?

Hello.

So I'll be the first to admit I am an anxious guy, and definitely a bit of a hypochondriac. I'd just like some fresh perspective on this though.

I am 26 years old, male, quit smoking in August of 2015(~1.5 years ago), after having smoked for about 10-11 years, ~7 pack years in total(10-13 cig per day).

Basically, I am scared I have COPD. I wake up every morning with mucus in my throat, brown-yellow-ish in color, it's on my tongue as well. Other than that I have no symptoms that I am aware of, no hard breathing etc.

I have booked a time for spirometry but that's in the end of March.

What are your thoughts? Am I over reacting here or could it be the first stage? If so, how is outlook?

Thanks!

Ok, here goes again!

I had managed to quit before slipping up around Thanksgiving.  I fell into that ridiculous "oh yeah I quit so it's ok if I smoke one ...or a dozen" trap, while hanging out with some social-smoker friends.  I cannot in fact smoke only socially, and pretty immediately started buying packs again.  The seasonal work I just wrapped up didn't help, as most folks I was working with also smoked.

But I know I can do this!  Last time I pulled off cold turkey I relied heavily on pork rinds to get through cravings.  I ate a LOT of pork rinds.  I think this time something like cucumbers might be a better move.  And thinking of myself as a non-smoker helps - the "I don't smoke" vs "I can't smoke / I am quitting" is a good mental framework.  Looking forward to being able to run again, having good energy, and not reeking of stale smoke!  I've also been doing a fair bit of reading on Stoicism, and I think that will also be helpful in facing down cravings, and not letting myself fall into sloppy thinking &amp; reacting.

Many thanks to everyone else here for posting your progress!  Coming across this sub regularly in the rest of my feed helps more than I would have thought when I first subscribed.  And to everyone else riding this process out to kick off the new year:

 Good luck!  You got this!

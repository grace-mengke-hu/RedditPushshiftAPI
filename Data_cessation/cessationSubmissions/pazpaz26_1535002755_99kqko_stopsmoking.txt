Day 5. Going strong!

I quit 5 days ago. I've only been using a couple puffs of my vape in the morning and a couple at night. Soon I will transition to using lower nicotine liquid and then stop all together. 

The other night I went to a club to see my friends, and I used to smoke a lot when I went there. I went there, and purposely avoided the smoking room. I did not smoke!

The hardest part right now is the mental addiction. I can talk my way out of it, I guess use logic against my brain. I get the mental desire or craving for a cigarette, and I tell myself that I don't actually need one, I just want one. And that it's okay to not always get what you want. Especially when that thing can kill you.

Anywho, to my fellow quitters: Stay strong! We are stronger than a piece of paper filled with a plant!

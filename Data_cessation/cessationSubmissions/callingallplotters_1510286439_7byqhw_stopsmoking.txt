going to bed early on day 16

17 days when i wake up tomorrow. no more cravings really, but i miss it sometimes. i guess i should just get in the habit of having a nice cup of tea and thinking. 
come to think of it, cigs were more disruptive to my thinking than PROductive... always started some thought and then wanted to go out for a smoke, or got done and wanted to go back in. pretty much a constant in-out, out-in. tomorrow is a month of no alcohol too. dont miss that as much (mostly just remember how much trouble it caused me).

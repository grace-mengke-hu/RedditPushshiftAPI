09.08.2018. is the day - I'm quitting!

I've smoked since I was 14. This year I'll turn 28. 

The thing with smoking is... I always enjoyed it. People told me that they can see how much I enjoy and that it's more than just a habbit. There was a time I smoked 3 packs a day. Yeah...

My reason for not quitting was that I had no good reason to quit. Health? I don't care. Money? Still don't care. With that attitude I knew that any attempt was doomed.

But something changed. I still don't really care about healthy and money but I find great pleasure in challanging myself.

In the past few months I picked up a lot new (and good) habits and challanged myself to not give up.

I stoped eating bread, drinking soft soda, drinking alchocole, started to work out every day - just to name a few.

Oh... and I got into law school!!

I look and feel like a million bucks and now is the time to quit. Reason being - just to prove myself and everyone else that I can!!

Only thing I'm worried about is eating too much... But I'll try ti find my way around it.

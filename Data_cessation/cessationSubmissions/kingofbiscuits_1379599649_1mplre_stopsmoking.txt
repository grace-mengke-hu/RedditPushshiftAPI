Relapsed after 4 days. FUCK.

What a total failure! I caved earlier today and have just finished up a second cigarette. What the hell is wrong with me?

I've read "the book" and read multiple parts over again, got the apps, know the benefits inside out and know they outweigh anything I could possibly get from a ciggie but I just can't do it. I don't have it in me.

How bad is it that I've relapsed, am I back to zero again? Will I have to go through all the withdrawal again? What can I do?

Resetting my badge, but I guess I'm okay with it

I've really been hitting my breaking point as this semester nears an end, and the stress and resultant depression from school have made me want my old security blanket of nicotine so bad. Finally cracked this morning and bought a pack on my way to class. 

And these things are fucking gross. Sitting here waiting for class to start and I'm dying to just get home and brush my teeth. I was choking on the first drags and not only do I not feel mentally better, I feel physically terrible now.

So my day is still gonna be hell, and I'm back to day zero, but I think I'm calling this one a win.

Edit: Thanks for the wise words of warning, friends. I'm ready.

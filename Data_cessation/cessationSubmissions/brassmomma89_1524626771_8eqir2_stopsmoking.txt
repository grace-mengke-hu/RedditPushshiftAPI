The immediate panic of quitting

So, first time poster. Ready to be a non smoker. Smoking is a dirty habit, totally unaffordable, and ruining my looks and health. I just put out my last cigarette and I hope that it will be the last one for the rest of my life... that being said, did anyone else panic when they decided to stop? This always happens to me. I can manage to quit for a while, sometimes for months (during each of my pregnancies) but I always make some stupid excuse to start back up and I really hate it. Hoping the support of this community will keep me accountable. Wish me luck!

I keep having dreams about smoking cigarettes

Im a month and a few days in of not smoking. But the last 2 weeks have been very tough, even with a vape pen to help me through the cravings. 

I don't dream much but this week I've had 3 nights of dreams in a row about having a cigarette or multiple and I wake up feeling insanely guilty until I realize it was just a dream. It's weird AF. 

Has anyone else experienced this?

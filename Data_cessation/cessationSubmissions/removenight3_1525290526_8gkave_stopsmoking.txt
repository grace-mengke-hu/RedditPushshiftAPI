My coworkers think I’m secretly interviewing at other jobs

I’m one-month smoke free today! I have not gone more than a week without cigarettes in approx. 15 years, so this is quite huge for me. To celebrate this milestone, I decided to dress up for work to help make this day even more special for me. My office is very business casual so dressing up for work has led my coworkers to second guess whether or not I’m interviewing for other jobs. They don’t know that I quit smoking, and I don’t plan on telling them for a while, so I’m ok with them guessing! Keeps them on their toes :) Here’s to many more months of being smoke-free!

Attempt #4...

Hey guys. Been reading through your sub for the past month or so, for stories, inspiration, etc. Here's my story: 27 years old, been smoking since I was 22 (I know, stupid to start so late, right? Oh well.) I have made a few cold turkey attempts to quit in the past 1/1.5 months, and I always tend to lose it around the 3-4 day mark. Cave, buy a pack, smoke one, feel like shit...hate myself. Something interesting I've noted is I'm not having any real physical symptoms minus just being a little more fatigued than usual. This is ALL IN MY HEAD! And I need help getting over that hump. Anybody here have any insight, tips? I smoked my last cigarette 2 hours ago, and I'm determined to make this the time I quit forever. HELP!!!

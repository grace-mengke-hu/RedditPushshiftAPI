Went to a protest. Gassed by riot police. Didn't smoke

Pretty much the title. Went to a rally against my government. Things turned violent after the gendarmerie started shooting tear gas into the crowds. I went home, literally shaking with rage for a few hours. Managed not to smoke. Hope to make it through the weekend.

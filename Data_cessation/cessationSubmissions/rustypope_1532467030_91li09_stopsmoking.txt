2 years smokefree

This day marks my 2 years of no smoking and I feel great! I'm 40 years old and I smoke for 22 years. I just wanted to offer a bit of encouragement to others to not give up! I tried for several years to quit but didn't seem to be able to and then just one day, it stuck. So to everyone who wants to, keep going and for all of the encouraging words from everyone who helped me quit, thank you!

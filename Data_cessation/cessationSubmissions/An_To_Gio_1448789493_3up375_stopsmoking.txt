My biological father, ladies and gentlemen

55 yrs old overweight white man who has been smoking since his teens, he was involved in car accident which left him permanently - albeit partially - disabled from a respiratory point of view, kept on smoking.
Recently a doctor of his has noticed three spots on his lungs and has put him through a battery of tests.
Results came in: not cancer.
Since it's not cancer he has sighed with relief and is currently coughing himself away 'cause he says he won't stop smoking, given it is his "only pleasure left"

First work stress after stop smoking

I just had to share this moment because I'm feeling really excited. I was on vacation for the last couple of days. Before starting them, I decided that I would quit smoking. I read the Easyway to stop smoking by Allen Carr which was a huge motivator for this. Anyhow, today my boss called me with an urgent issue to resolve, which I did. As this was affecting end users my stress was high and as a consequence my craving for a cigarette was huge, but I managed to not smoke that little piece of filth. I feel really happy about this.

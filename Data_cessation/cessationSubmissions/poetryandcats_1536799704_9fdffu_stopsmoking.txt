Dollar Store Dopamine

I hate smoking, I bet you hate smoking too. It sucks, right? Yet if we got a short while without one, the relief of lighting up in incomparable. But the release of enjoyment is quickly shut down, and all you’re left with is a long and gross burning stick that you barely want to finish. However, that short relief seems worth it. 

I’m on Day 3 right now, and Ive ruined my quit a few times this past week. Each time I’ve let myself have one, I release how unpleasant, distasteful, and harsh it is. And the negatives far outweigh the lack of dopamine in my brain.

Fuck all that, fuck those cravings! They’re signs that you’re getting past this. I’ve been so continually pissed off the last two days, but my energy is coming back and I truly feel I don’t need that cheap, dollar store dopamine anymore. The other places it can be found are so much better!

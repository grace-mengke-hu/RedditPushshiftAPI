150 days today!

Fucking loving it! My lungs feel good, food tastes AWESOME, and I feel that I handle stress better than when I was a smoker. My trick was to sort of brainwash myself by mentally equating smoking with something foul, such as sucking on a turd, or being locked in a room full of decaying putrescence. According to Cessation Nation, a very handy, free ap, I have saved $812.52, and haven't smoked 3009 cigarettes. Fuck yeah! I'm awesome, but I couldn't have done it without you fine folks, so I wanted to say thank you all for sharing your stories and advice!

Just finished day 4..

About to hit the hay on day 4! The cravings were at an all time high today.. could be due to stress at work. I actually went and signed up for a gym and was able to work out for an hour and a half straight.. something I never thought I could do. Imagine in two weeks what I will be able to accomplish... 

I am just so scared for this upcoming weekend. Last time I quit, I made it through the week just fine, but started again on Saturday due to boredom. We have a wedding to attend with all our friends who still smoke and drink (Don't even want to risk alcohol at this point). Can't back out of the wedding now.. It's going to be a hurdle to overcome but I know I can do it! Any words of encouragement would really help out :) This sub is keeping me SUPER motivated!

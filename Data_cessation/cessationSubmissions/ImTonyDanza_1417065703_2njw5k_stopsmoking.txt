My Journey

Started smoking 2 years ago. I grew up around tobacco and liked the way it smelt. I waited until I was 20 to start and I smoked until the day after my 22 birthday in march. 

I stopped until my bud was moving back to Australia in late July. It was a good ol time and couldn't help myself. 

I've been working out more trying to get my cardio back and I feel great. It's almost been 8 months out of the year that I haven't smoked and I feel great.

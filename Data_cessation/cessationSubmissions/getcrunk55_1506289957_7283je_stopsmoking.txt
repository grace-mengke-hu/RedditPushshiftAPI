week 4 of patch

guys, I need some advice. I have been a pack a day smoker for about 7 years. I stopped with the patch and am on week 4 of step 1 (21mg). For the last three days, just by chance/laziness I did not take the patch and today would have been the day i go to the store to buy more. it has been tougher without the patch and i do feel less "safe". this is the furthest ive ever gotten while quitting.. what should i do?

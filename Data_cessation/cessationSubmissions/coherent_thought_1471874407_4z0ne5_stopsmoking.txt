Holy shit

I actually made it. 2 whole weeks without nicotine in any form and nobody has died. Haha.

The worst is behind me now. It's time to stay strong, resolved, and never ever ever ever pick one up again. To those of you just starting out on this journey, hang tough! It is possible. I smoked for 35 years and quit cold turkey. If I can do it, you can too!

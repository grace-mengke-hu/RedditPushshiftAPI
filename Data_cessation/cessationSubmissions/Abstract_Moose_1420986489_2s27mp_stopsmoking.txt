Almost five days. Life is throwing everything it can at me right now.

Relationship issues, financial burdens, everything that can go wrong is going wrong. My brain is telling me that smoking will lighten the load, make all of this easier. I feel like the mental cravings are much more intense now that the first three days are over. I catch myself thinking about how I've "always really wanted to keep smoking" and "I'm never gonna make it anyways".

I won't lie, reading all the posts from people in the second week is discouraging me, sometimes I don't think I have what it takes to make it long enough to not feel miserable anymore. Misery is my status quo now.

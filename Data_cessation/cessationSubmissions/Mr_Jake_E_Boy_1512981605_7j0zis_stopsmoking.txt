Looking to Quit soon. Advice?

Hi all. Im looking to quit before my birthday which is on the 20th. This is roughly 2 weeks past my last quit attempt.
I want to go into it fully loaded with a plan. I am half way through Alan Carr's easy way to quit smoking.
Does anyone have any advice so i can put together a strategy for quitting?

How are you doing today?

I would like to know how you fellow quitters are doing today. How are you feeling? What challenges or triggers have you meet today? What did you do to overcome it?


Today is my first day of work since i quit (i quit on friday) not having to sneak out every hour or so to smoke is strange. I have not had any cravings yet and I'm convinced i will make it through the day just fine :)

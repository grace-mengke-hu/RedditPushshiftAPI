5 Days

This is the longest I’ve gone without smoking since I was sixteen. Yesterday I almost broke down— I had a panic attack at work, and I was angry at myself for getting upset since I’m using a vape, and therefore still getting nicotine. I was going to switch to 0mg. If I was going to suffer, I wanted to be thorough about it.

Then I did the math and realized I’ve been vaping the equivalent of half a pack of cigarettes of nicotine per day. I used to smoke two packs a day.

So, I guess I’m doing better than I thought! I’m going to keep on as I am for at least a month. It’s *working* and I don’t want to ruin that.

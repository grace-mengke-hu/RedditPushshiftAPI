Just quit smoking but I bought a juul?

I quit smoking about 3 days ago and it’s been hard but I am still really addicted to nicotine I got a juul for the time being until I can get a CBD Vape I don’t enjoy vaping and I think I might switch to a patch? I smoked a pack a day so this is hard any help would be grateful

Day 18, comfortably numb

I don’t feel any cravings and I don’t think about smoking throughout the day. I expected the first few weeks to be challenging, but it’s actually rather easy. Just the same state of mind I would have like 30 minutes after a smoke - not going for another one because I just had one. But this state just doesn’t go anywhere.

I think I finally quit, but should stay vigilant and not let it crawl back into my life. Some of my previous attempts were ruined by feeling too comfortable - and I was lighting up again (because hey it’s so easy to quit). Not going to let this dirty trick work this time.

Not another puff people, stay strong!

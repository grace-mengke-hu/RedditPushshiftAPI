Feeling overwhelmed, but my determination is stronger

Honestly, I've felt so lonely, depressed, and stuck in life lately. I've been making some great changes lately, and I do have wonderful friends online and irl, but I broke up with my ex a couple of weeks ago. It was for the best, I wasn't feeling chemistry. I just miss companionship so much, even if just on a platonic level. It's made me not want to be sober or clean of anything tbh. 

Even though everything in me is screaming for relief from these emotions, that itch for some kind of substance to make it all go away for a little while, I know that I can't turn back now. I keep imagining how I'd feel having been 17 days nicotine free, only to have to start over again. I refuse to consider that as an option. So even if I feel down about myself and my life, I'm proud of myself for this and can take some comfort in it.

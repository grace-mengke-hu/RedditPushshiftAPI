Day 7, this is not as hard as I thought it would be

I'm using the patch and I have no desire to smoke. It's weird. Sometimes I still feel like I should smoke, but I don't really want to.

The only times I crave are when I wake up and have my coffee and right as I'm leaving work. But I don't have cigarettes, so I can't smoke even if I really wanted to.

This has been far easier than I expected and I wish I quit months ago. I'm happy not smoking and don't really want to go back at all.

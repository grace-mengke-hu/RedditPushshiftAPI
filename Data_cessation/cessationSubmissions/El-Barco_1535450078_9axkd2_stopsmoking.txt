No pressure no smoke

I 've been smoking for 14 years and rarely tried to stop. I actually enjoyed it a lot. 
Last week I had to undergo surgery for a thing not related to smoking. But j was strongly advised nor to smoke before the surgery and not immediately after waking up. I 've been clean since then and rarely had issues with craving. I just told myself it's ok if you go back but let's see how long you can withstand. So if I go back to smoking then that's how it is but for the moment it works quite well not to put any pressure on myself. 
Maybe pressure is the key...

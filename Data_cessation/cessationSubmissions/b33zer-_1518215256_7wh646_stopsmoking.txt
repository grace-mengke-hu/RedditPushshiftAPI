24th times the charm

Today would have been my 1 month smoke free. Instead, I choose to become a closet smoker and only smoked on my way to work and back and then when I would take the dog for a long walk in the freezing cold to puff one or two down quickly. I went from a pack a day to half a pack, which I was telling myself how awesome that was; when in reality I was still slowly killing myself. My “cravings” while I was at home in the morning and at night have gone away. And for the weekends it’s non-existent, except for maybe once or twice a day. But then they slowly came back, and I found myself to damn near smoking a pack a day. I would chain smoke faster in fear I would be caught by the boyfriend who thought I quit when he did. 

The other day we had a staff meeting before school and I was running behind because of the weather and I ran in to throw my things down and went to sit down and I could smell the smoke on my and felt immediately embarrassed. I tried to sit far away as possible from people but I could still smell it. It made me sick, and I felt sorry for myself. 

So today I’m back to day 1. I have none on my or in my car. I can’t leave because we’re snowed in. I literally have no choice but to quit today and for the rest of my life.

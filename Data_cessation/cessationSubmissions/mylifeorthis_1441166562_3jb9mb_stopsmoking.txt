Can't believe I got past 2+ weeks and still going nicotine free! My mind and concentration on the other hand, is still in cahoots... what to do?

Posted a few weeks ago here to get support and it's been working out amazingly! Completely avoided all nicotine options and have been cold turkey since. Original post : https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/3hi49e/1_how_to_get_over_feeling_like_a_vegetablebrain/

The cravings still come on some high stress situations and I'm able to manage it by deep breathing or thinking how much of hell I went through those first few days and never wanting to repeat that again or doing some quick pushups/cardio for a few minutes. I'll come to this channel to read a post to remind myself and that helps a lot too.

Gosh, I never knew the smell of what I smelled like when I passed someone outside who was smoking. I could smell it from 10-15 feet away. You all were right!

Saving a lot of money and that's been good and no more stresses to get out of the place just for me to drive out in the middle of the night to get a pack of smokes. 

I'm still tackling the learning and concentrating problem when I'm trying to study and its seriously affecting my school performance. I know nicotine is not the answer any more and so just wanted to stop by and see what else I could try to get through this part. It's more of that zoned-out feeling... my conversations with others have been still edgy and not the same as before and I know I have a lot to get over with on the illusions I had prior. 

I'll be nearing the 20 day mark and wondering when that vegetable like fog can fade away so that I can study better. It's definitely there and something I can't keep telling my mind to focus on or out of... 

Thanks again to everyone here for their stories and encouragement. If I can do it, so can you... believe what everyone says here!

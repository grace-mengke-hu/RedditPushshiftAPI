What benefits will i gain from quitting smoking, whilst vaping instead?

Started vaping 2 days ago, quitting cigarettes at the same time. I have no physical way of purchasing them for a long time, so im sticking this out.

I've seen several timelines of the benefits of quitting smoking, but they seem based on quitting pure nicotine aswell. Currently my liquids are at 0.6% and my first refill was today (in case the frequency of my vaping is necessary info)

So my main question is: What benefits will and will i not see if im successful in my endeavour? I do aim to quite vaping altogether, when i move down to 0% nicotine and am comfortable. But as nicotine and well, vapor, are in the equation still, im certain that these magical benefits won't be in their full.

Any elaboration would be wonderful from you guys :)

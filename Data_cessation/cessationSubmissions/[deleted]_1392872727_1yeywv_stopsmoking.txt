Only 5 days in....a world of difference

I quit smoking officially Friday night with a final smoke before midnight. Saturday was my first smoke free day. And it was a HORRIBLE day. The cravings were unbearable. I was jittery and I couldn't stop pacing around at work, even people could notice I was struggling a bit. Every time I quit these cravings typically last two, three weeks into the quitting process.

Last few days: not a single craving.  It's like I never even smoked before. Even went to the gas station today and when I got home I realized I hadn't even thought about cigs while I was there. I don't know why this time has been so easy, but I hope it stays that way so I can kick the habit!


In 5 days: sense of smell back, I can taste food, I'm sleeping better, can walk up stairs and no get tired. Appetite is back in full force. I'm actually eating full meals and enjoying it. It's odd...when I eat I feel full. Like "I ate too much" full. Not sure if I'm actually eating that much (I hope not!) or if my body just isn't used to actually finishing a regular meal anymore!

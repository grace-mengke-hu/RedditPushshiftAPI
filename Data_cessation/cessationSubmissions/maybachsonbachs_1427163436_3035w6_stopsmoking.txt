Smoked 1 1/2 cigs out at a bar. It's not the end of the world, and it's no excuse to start again.

Previous weekend (10 days ago) was my first "test". I went to a bar with an old friend and drank a bunch. While walking to the next bar we each smoked a cig and then later on that night we shared one.

In the moment I really wanted to smoke so I did. I didn't buy a pack later and I haven't smoked since. I knew I would eventually smoke again. My goal isn't zero cigarettes for the rest of my life. My goal is to reduce from a pack a day to less than a pack a year.

If you feel like I feel then make sure you don't slip. Don't turn 1 cigarette into a pack, because that pack will become another 6 months of smoking until the next quit attempt.

If you want to quit forever then you can take this tip from me. Don't get drunk and hang out with people you know smoke. It's super super tempting. Maybe only starting drinking around smokers once you have confirmed you can at least resist while not drunk.

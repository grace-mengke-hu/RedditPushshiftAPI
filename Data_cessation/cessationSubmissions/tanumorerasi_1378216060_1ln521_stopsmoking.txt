My throat hurts, decided to quit

I am smoking my last cig right now. Not gonna smoke again. I am sick of feeling lazy and powerless after a smoke. I am sick of being scared that this shit will kill me. I've got so many goals and dreams that I want to achieve and smoking is doing nothing but holding me back!

Sry, I just had to let it out.

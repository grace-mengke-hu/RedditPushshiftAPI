It is easier to deal with stressful situations since I stopped smoking.

This was hard for me to imagine, but it's true.

Just one example. I used to get really nervous before I went to the dentist. I always smoked during the half-hour drive. This week, I was almost to the dentist's office when I realized I hadn't felt nervous at all. 

Smoking wasn't helping me cope with stress, it was making it harder to deal with stress.

20 Days wow...

I've only been smoking for less than a year and decided to stop now  before it's too late, can't believe I have gone 20 days without smoking i am very proud of myself there, i hope my body did some recovery to fix the damage that smoking did, and after this huge achievement (yes for me 20 days is huge) i don't think i will go back to smoking again.

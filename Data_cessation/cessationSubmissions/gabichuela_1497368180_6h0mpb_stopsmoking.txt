Hoping this is the last time

I'm a serial quitter, and the worst part is most recently I started lying to people around me about my smoking. I started fifteen years ago. In the past seven years I've gone through bouts of smoking then not smoking...my longest time away from it was for 11 months. So here I am, day one for the 50th time. How do you stay motivated to not smoke?  

EDIT: Yesterday I came clean to my fiance that I had been hiding my smoking from him, and I had once again quit. It was hard to be honest, but I feel a lot better about it, the lying I mean. I'm still struggling with the motivation, but even while I navigate what my motivation is I've decided to maintain the non smoking.

For the very last time!

Iâ€™m on day 5 of quitting again. Iâ€™ve only tried quitting about 20 times! ðŸ™„ but Iâ€™ve never made it past day 3. So Iâ€™m feeling pretty good about this! Iâ€™m getting Bariatric surgery in November and Iâ€™m changing up the way I treat myself. Losing about 100 pounds and getting back to being in nature and leaving toxic people behind are just a few ways that Iâ€™m loving myself and respecting myself more. ðŸ’œ

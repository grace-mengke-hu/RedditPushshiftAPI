Having worst cravings ever since.

Last week was ok, but this week I really have a hard time to get along with the cravings. I thought it'd degrade since it's the second week but it became worse :'(

A guy who quit smoking 4 years ago told me to get used to those cravings because they never pass. There always going to moments that you feel like to have a cig.

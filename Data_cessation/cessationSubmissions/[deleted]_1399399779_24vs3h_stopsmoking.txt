[x-post from r/birthcontrol... thought i'd give it a shot] Quit smoking at the beginning of 2014... now no period?

Hey everyone,
Kinda buggin over here. I've been on Amethia/Seasonique for over 5 years now, a majority of that time being a smoker. It varied from a pack a day to maybe a pack every 4 days, and at the beginning of January I finally said enough was enough. I'm very happy to say that I am truly done with cigarettes! I feel great!
So smoking on birth control is a big no-no, I understand that. Dealt with a ton of issues that I'm sure are a consequence of that, from spotting for months to having a very painful menstrual cycle (every 3 months, for Amethia). I didn't notice anything significant when I first quit, got my period as normal - probably because it was within the first 30 days of quitting cigarettes.
Now, 120+ days in, I'm on my 4th blue pill and NO PERIOD. Nothing. I had discharge on day 2 and still... nothing. Needless to say my immediate thoughts are.. well, obvious (no, I dont want to say it). But my next thoughts are, is this a result of having a normal period on birth control is like? Is my body finally adjusting?
If anybody out there has experienced this, and could just share some advice for my peace of mind.. I would be incredibly grateful.

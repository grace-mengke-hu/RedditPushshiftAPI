Any Tips?

Ive only been smoke free for 4 1/2 days and slipped up last night. I had 2. They taste horrible but so good at the same time. Ive been all day without one, even if its 9am. I need to do this, not only for me but for my kids.. I need tips to occupy my hands and mouth.. Ive done gum and vapes so far but when I'm in the car or after eating is the worse for me.

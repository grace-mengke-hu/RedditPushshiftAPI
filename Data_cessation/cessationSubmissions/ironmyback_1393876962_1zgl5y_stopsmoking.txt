Day 4.

First day at work since I've gone smoke free and all went well. Come lunch time, I was absolutely starving! Carb and protein heavy lunch soon sorted that out! 

Felt a bit spaced out in the morning, and when I drank tea I felt a bit jittery. It must be to do with metabolism changes. I'll tell you one thing though after my Carb heavy lunch I would normally had fallen asleep (well sleepy lol) which is due to the lack of insulin being released to channel the glucose; nicotine caused insulin resistance. But today, I felt fine. It's like my body sorted it all out, I felt my body doing what it should do with the insulin. Later I played football after work and boom! Energy levels were at their peak! 

You're probably wondering why I'm rambling on about insulin etc. Well my main drive for quitting smoking is so I can gain some weight. I want to put on at least 2 stone, so if I start seeing the scales go up then ill have the biggest smile on my face. Don't worry people, I'm also a lifter so I need my body to release that insulin in order to make gains. Need to bulk up and like I said in my previous post... 

Time to get shredded.

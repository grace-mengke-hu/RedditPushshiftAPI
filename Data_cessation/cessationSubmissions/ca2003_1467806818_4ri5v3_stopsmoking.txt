If not now...when?

This is what I ask myself this morning as I stubb the last cigarette from my pack on my morning commute. I'm on the cusp of 30 and I have been smoking for 12 years, (thinking about that figure always fills me with incredible regret that only increases with each passing year), and I have decided to regain my independence from this expensively smelly, useless, incredibly risky habit.

My previous quitting attempts, (which must number in at least more than half a dozen), have all ended in shame as my discipline falls apart. In the past, I have even posted on this sub only to forget to check back in when I should have been reminding myself why I always end up so desperate to stop smoking. 

My tools:

A complete and honest understanding that I will always be addicted and I ALWAYS need to be on guard. There is a part of my brain that WILL attempt to ambush me when I am at my weakest.

Remembering that pretty shitty people are reaping huge profits by keeping me addicted.

This sub. I have resolved to check back whenever I find the cravings unbearable.

A ton of Trident.

Quit It app is a pretty fun way to see how much money that you have saved.

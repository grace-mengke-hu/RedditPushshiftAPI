Keeping something in my mouth

Hey guys! I smoked for 7 years, read Allan Carr's book and then it just appeared I was scared of making the first move. The hardest part was to set the date, then everything went smoothly. 
(If you didn't read that book, I strongly encourage you to do so! )
One thing that I noticed and maybe someone can advise me with that:
I keep on biting pens and lollipop sticks. I know how stupid it sounds but I just need to keep something in my mouth. Anyone has/ had the same?

Anger?

I'm day 9 into my quit. Using patches but almost feels like nothing. 

I was smoking 40+ a day since moving  away.  Now I hate my life and everyone around me because I can't smoke. It's not that I can't it's that I don't want to. But then I filled the last year or so with smoking the day away. 

Everything seems wrong. I hate it. Since about day 3 I have an hour or two crying hating my life really wanting cigarettes , getting really angry and it's feels horrible and the  after I'm fine.  Is this normal or am I going crazy?  

I feel crazy. I'm in one of those one hour anger/upset things now. I just want to say f it all and go buy fags but Im fighting it I don't want to smoke. 

This probably  makes no sense because my right now nothing in my head makes sense.

I WANT TO LIVE

24 days ago I suffered a Subarachnoid Haemorrhage (bleed on the brain) I am only 42yrs old and this has been a huge wake up call for me. I have not touched a cigarette since 2 hours before I nearly died. I would never want my loved ones to watch me in ICU wondering if I would make it. I am alive to tell my story and I am proud to be smoke free for 24 days but I just wish I had given up sooner.

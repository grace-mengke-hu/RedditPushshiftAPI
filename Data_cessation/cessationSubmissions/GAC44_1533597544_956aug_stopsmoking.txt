Scared to quit because of withdrawals...

The last time I tried quitting I was 16 hours into it and I couldn't get out of bed I was in so much pain emotionally and feeling like complete crap physically. Ever since that I've been afraid to quit again because I don't want to feel like that again and people tell me the third day is the hardest! If I can't go 16 hours how the hell will I make it past three days?! This seems impossible for me.

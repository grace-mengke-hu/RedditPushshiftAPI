Cigarrettes man...

I used to weight 275lbs until i took a turn for better. But there's something that my weight loss left me (other than awesome looks), and that is the bad habit of smoking.

I have smoked since i was 17(im 20 now), but back then, i use to smoke one or two cigarretes a day, sometimes, weeks would pass and i wouldn't touch a single cigarrete, and i wouldn't even notice it. But while i was dieting, i pretty much used cigarretes to fight my anxiety for food.

And here i am, 77 pounds lighter, but i'm smoking half a pack a day (sometimes the whole pack). Maybe if i stop smoking i'll gain all the weight back?. I really want to stop smoking, but, at the same time i don't want to because it feels so good.

I know this post doesn't really contribute with anything to the comunity, but i wanted to get it off my chest.

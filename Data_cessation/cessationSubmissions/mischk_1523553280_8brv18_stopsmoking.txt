Things that help me to stay smoke free

Things that help me to stay smokefree

here are some things that help me to stay smokefree:

*  Meditation (There is a great app called Headspace)
* going out for walk
* drinking a lot of tea and water
* having some small distractions for work breaks like: crosswords, smartphone, doodling, a book
* talk to lots of friends about quit smoking (social control)
* awareness about the reasons why I quit smoking
* self awareness (getting a feeling for what I really need instead of cigarettes)

Hope these thoughts can help you. Stay strong!

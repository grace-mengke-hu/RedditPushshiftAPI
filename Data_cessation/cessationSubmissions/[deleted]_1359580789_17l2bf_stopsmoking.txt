Countdown to the "Big Day" this week

So, this is my fourth time to quit smoking. The first time I was in the Navy, and being out to sea for months at a time was my failure. Second time I quit I used nic-gum and was smoke free for 8 months, but then I was in Japan during the 2011 9.0 earthquake and tsunami, so yeah, that was too much for me. Third time, I tried an approach where I didnt use any nic-gum or anything but followed a program where I had to carry a pack in my hand at all times and always have it near me, so that I always had to make the choice not to smoke...that lasted about 2 months. 

This time, I am going back to the nic-gum. It worked the longest for me, and if it wasn't for the earthquake, I probably would still be smoke free! I found this subreddit and I am excited to be a part of it and get support from everyone and give support out. 

Any tips from anyone who has gone through a similar situation to help prepare me?

My quit day is Sunday.

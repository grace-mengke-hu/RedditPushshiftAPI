One time I am thankful to have been sick with flu

Because on day two of my flu I didn't feel like smoking, or day three and so on...

 I've been sick for a week now and haven't had a cigarette or a craving once. I am getting much better now, and I guess it looks like I quit by accident, but am going to stay quit on purpose. 

EDIT: I am not sure how the badge bot calculates the badges, but I requested it for 2018-01-16 and it somehow gave me 250 days, when it should only read 7 days.

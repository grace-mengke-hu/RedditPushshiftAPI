4th attempt, 1st day

Hey everyone! Just found out about this subreddit through another user. Today marks the 1st day of my 4th attempt to quit smoking in 6 years. Twice with a patch, once (last time) with Chantix and again today with patches. So far it's been 15 hours and I think I'm doing OK. The patch is making my arm ache and I'm really irritable, but that's it. From what I remember, days 2 and 3 are the hardest, so not looking forward to that at all.

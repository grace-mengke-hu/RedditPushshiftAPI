Nobody uses vaping to quit?

After failing for years of every type of attempt, I just bought a vape. It's the only thing that has ever helped me. 

At day one I effortlessly smoked 1/3 the amount. By day three and four I smoked maybe only two cigs. Day five I finished a half cig nursing it all day. Now at the end of day six I've had no will to go buy any or smoke. 

I am having some withdrawal symptoms but my nicotine levels are at a fraction of what I smoked last week. I didn't get too cranky ever, I'm certainly coughing up mung and clearly detoxing (I'll spare the details). Lungs feel great, more energy, better sleep... and I smell like blue raspberry now instead of ass. 


I didn't intend to just jump and run either, I thought maybe it would take a few months to transition but it all just fell into place. After so many attempts and failures from medication, cold turkey... you name it, I was very cynical but it's actually an amazing and far more healthy crutch. 


Better vapor then carcinogens, poisons, stinking, spending money. I know it still nicotine but while I detox from all the other junk in cigarettes, the taste, smell and routine,this is perfect for me. 

It was about $190.00 to start but that's cheaper then smoking at an average of 6-7 thousand a year. Vaping sites say a year for them is about $6-700 annually. Plus it's cheaper then cancer or any of the other death sentences. 

Anyhow, that's my story. It's working for me.  A pack a day to none in under a week. Nearly effortlessly by vaping.

Vape/e-cigarette are they a reasonably healthy alternative?

Been trying to quit and I make it three or so days then relapse. My roommate gave me a vape and previously I always judged the people walking around in clouds of apple cinnamon blend with pumpkin spice but they work. I still vowed not to use it in public but it helps with the cravings and oral fixation. More importantly I have done a little (30 min of Google last night) research on the things and can't find any good surveys or scientific info on them. Would you recommend them- are they relatively low impact-any good links? 

Thanks for your input.

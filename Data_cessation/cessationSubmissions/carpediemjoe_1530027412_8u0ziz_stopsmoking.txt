How to Be a Better Person, Step by Step

Over the past year and a half since I quit smoking I have lost 34 pounds, cut my cholestrol in half, and made lots of great life changes. I wrote down how the process worked for me in the hopes that it may help others. Feel free to share this around as much as you want.

1) Quit smoking

The main options you have for things to help you quit are:

1) Wellbutrin

2) Hypnosis

3) Vape/Patches/Gum (Nicotine Replacement)

4) Chantix

5) Black Pepper

I finally quit with a combination of 1 and 2. The problem with 3 is that the withdrawal from nicotine is what is causing your quitting angst. So by slowly tapering down you are just painfully prolonging the withdrawal period. I tried 4 but it messed my sleep up really bad so I couldn’t continue it. I carried an inhaler thing that let me smell the scent of black pepper and it helped somewhat but didn’t really make a big dent.

Step 1: Talk to your doctor and get on Wellbutrin if you can.

Step 2: Watch this video that explains the psychology of why you smoke and how to quit: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zeZhHq0WtY&amp;t=0s&amp;index=31&amp;list=LLhdU0KN03tuu9w6gveE7f7g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zeZhHq0WtY&amp;t=0s&amp;index=31&amp;list=LLhdU0KN03tuu9w6gveE7f7g)

Step 3: Listen to this hypnosis recording as many times as you can, at least once a day. Make sure it is uninterrupted: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6A1IOkIsM&amp;t=0s&amp;index=29&amp;list=LLhdU0KN03tuu9w6gveE7f7g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy6A1IOkIsM&amp;t=0s&amp;index=29&amp;list=LLhdU0KN03tuu9w6gveE7f7g)

Step 4: If you find depression creeping in from quitting smoking, listen to this hypnosis recording as many times as you can. Make sure it is uninterrupted: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2s2bVWWu7A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2s2bVWWu7A)

2) Eat clean / lose weight / lower cholesterol

To burn off the calories from 8 walnuts you need to walk for 45 minutes. Moral of the story is that to lose weight you have to count your calories. You have to burn 3,500 calories to lose a pound. So if you burn an extra 500 calories a day and keep your calories intake to only what you need, you will lose a pound a week. Find the “Lose It” app and use it to track your calories. It will tell you how many you are allowed per day.

Step 1: Only eat foods that don’t have a list of ingredients on them. Fruits, nuts, veggies, meat, dairy.

Step 2: Cut out bread. It just has way too many calories so if you eat an ok amount it means you can barely eat anything else and stay on target for your calorie goal.

Step 3: Drink as much green tea as you can.

Step 4: Eat/drink chia seeds (lots of good fiber)

Step 5: Take a shot each day that is ½ lemon juice and ½ Apple Cider Vinegar (make sure to get the ACV that “has the mother” on the label)

Step 6: At night drink a cup of hot water that has lemon juice, honey, and cinnamon in it.

Step 7: Use this BMI calculator to see what you should weigh based on your height and try to get into the healthy range: [https://www.hmrprogram.com/resources/getting-started/bmi-chart](https://www.hmrprogram.com/resources/getting-started/bmi-chart) 

Step 8: Take fish oil supplements

By doing these things you will automatically make it easier to stick to your calorie goal, plus all the vitamins you are getting will help your cholesterol levels.

3) Exercise

If you try to lose weight by exercise alone you will fail. So why exercise? It is good for your heart and muscles. This may seem like it isn’t a big deal but when you run into 50 year olds getting strokes and heart attacks you’ll see that it doesn’t take a long time for bad habits to have a big impact.

Step 1: Start doing a 30 minute walk on your lunch break. I bring my walking shoes to work with me and my dress code is pretty casual so I can get away with it. If you are wearing a suit to work this probably won’t work. 

Step 2: Do the 7 Minute Workout before you take a shower: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECxYJcnvyMw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECxYJcnvyMw) I burn the same calories in those 7 minutes as I do on a 30 min walk. 

Step 3: If you want to keep taking it up a notch, add a walk after dinner. I’ve got young kids so taking them out in the stroller is fun for them and gets me some more exercise.

With this you will be doing what you need to stay healthy and you don’t NEED to do anymore. Obviously if you want to get big muscles you’ll have to do more.

4) Stop/limit drinking alcohol

Alcohol causes cancer: [https://www.asco.org/about-asco/press-center/news-releases/statement-alcohol-linked-to-cancer-november-2017](https://www.asco.org/about-asco/press-center/news-releases/statement-alcohol-linked-to-cancer-november-2017). Plus it has a TON of calories. You have to walk 30 minutes to burn the calories in ONE can of regular beer. And really it has no health benefits. Red wine may help but the impact on your cancer risk almost cancels it out. 

So what to do instead? Make a special drink to replace it. I chose kombucha. It is basically a fermented carbonated sweet tea. Sound gross? The end product really just takes like a La Croix. I used this startup kit and it worked really well for me: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00STZ3KCI/ref=oh\_aui\_detailpage\_o09\_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00STZ3KCI/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

5) Simplify your belongings / donate what you don’t use

I love the quote “The items which you own and don’t use are stolen from those who can use them.” You know you should declutter and donate your closet packed with clothes so here’s how to get the motivation.

Step 1: Watch the Minimalism documentary on Netflix: [https://minimalismfilm.com/](https://minimalismfilm.com/) 

Step 2: Read the book or listen to the audiobook of Soulful Simplicity. You can always check if your library has it if you don’t want to spend the money: [https://www.amazon.com/Soulful-Simplicity-Living-Less-Lead/dp/0143130684](https://www.amazon.com/Soulful-Simplicity-Living-Less-Lead/dp/0143130684)

Step 3: Read the book or listen to the audiobook The More of Less. You can always check if your library has it if you don’t want to spend the money: [https://www.amazon.com/More-Less-Finding-Under-Everything/dp/1601427964/ref=pd\_sim\_14\_7?\_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd\_rd\_i=1601427964&amp;pd\_rd\_r=1M13VHRWGEXDT6B1MY6W&amp;pd\_rd\_w=yOskb&amp;pd\_rd\_wg=it52T&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=1M13VHRWGEXDT6B1MY6W](https://www.amazon.com/More-Less-Finding-Under-Everything/dp/1601427964/ref=pd_sim_14_7?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=1601427964&amp;pd_rd_r=1M13VHRWGEXDT6B1MY6W&amp;pd_rd_w=yOskb&amp;pd_rd_wg=it52T&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=1M13VHRWGEXDT6B1MY6W) 

Step 4: Find a non-profit who will come pick up the things you want to donate. For example, Google “donation pickup Kansas City” if you live in Kansas City.

Step 5: Set a date for the donation pickup to give you a deadline. And start to grab stuff you don’t use. The books in Step 2 and 3 have lots of great tips on how to choose what to give away.

Step 6: Listen to as many episodes of the Slow Home Podcast as you can to stay motivated: [https://slowyourhome.com/the-slow-home-podcast/](https://slowyourhome.com/the-slow-home-podcast/) 

6) Reduce your waste production

One year ago...

One year ago, I apparently tried to quit smoking. I guess I never reset my badge when that failed :(

September mustve the time of year for my personal Annual Review or something,  because once again I'm looking at ways to improve my life. I just got a new job and am struggling to keep up with the expectations. I also just left my girlfriend, and am trying to get control over my body and my time. Quitting again is definitely on my list, but it's such a massive effort on its own that I'm not sure I can handle it in conjunction with everything else. Anyone have advice for this? I know it will help me in the long run, but with everything else going on, it feels like I need to gain control in a couple other areas first. 

Just thought i'd drop in and let you guys know that my badge is a lie, and see how you guys might handle a similar situation.

Day 1- Lets get this party started!

First morning coffee sans cigarette in years. If my addiction was a kid it would be in high school.  Weird, but not bad. Cat seems to approve of change and has rewarded me with snuggles. 

Definitely need to clean up the butts from the weekend that are now scattered in the bushes.  And take out the trash. 

Here's to cold turkey!

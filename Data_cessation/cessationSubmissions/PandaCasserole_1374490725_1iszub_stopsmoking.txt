My Dad picked up smoking... I've quit for 2 years.

I was a smoker for about 8 years and was able to quit cold turkey. I was smoking 2 packs a day and was able to quit. My dad was a smoker when he was younger and quit after I was born. Now 25 years later he has picked it back up after his recent divorce. I'm only guessing he has picked it up b/c of going out to bars meeting wild women and being a single dude. 

I'm not sure even now what my motivation to quit was. I am worried about his health. For heaven sakes he is smoking Molboro Reds! Cowboy killers!

So far I havent said anything. Just kinda go along with it. I dont think saying anything will change the smoking as it didnt really help me to change. What could I do to help him see that its bad? I'm frustrated.

... I mean his mother (my G-ma) died of emphysema directly related to smoking.

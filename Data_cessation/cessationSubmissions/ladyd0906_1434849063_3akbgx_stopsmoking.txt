To smoke or NOT to smoke? I had a big dilemma today, I was very nervous...

I had a fight with my boyfriend and I was about to give up the temptation to smoke because I was very nervous. In that moment I had the feeling that I'd smoke a whole packet of cigarettes one after another and how well I would feel. But I stayed 2 seconds and I thought and I asked myself a question. it's worth to give up all the times in which I resisted? and for what. I am really so weak? I am proud that today in the whole time I was the closest to "the brink" and I stood up. And even if I would have given up, that was the solution? I think not. Maybe five minutes I had forgotten the issue, but I am sure I would have felt sick because it was the first cigarette in the last 2 weeks and it wouldn't have helped anything because the problem with my boyfriend was still there. 
But the desire was so strong :-(
P.S. sorry if my english is not so good. this is not my basic language but I'm trying the best

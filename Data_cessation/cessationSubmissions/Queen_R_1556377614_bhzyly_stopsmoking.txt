just had a relapse and feel so demotivated for it. how long did this set me back?

i was only off cigarrettes completely for 5 days, today was gonna be day number 6. i smoked around 3 a day for a week before the 5 days from about 12 a day. today i had a relapse triggered by anxiety and anger and smoked 3. does this mean the past 5 days were for nothing? is it gonna reset now ? 

i know to avoid triggers and negative people but sometimes you live with them, what coping strategies can you all recommend ? 

thanks 

oh and if this helps with info, i have to quit smoking for an operation

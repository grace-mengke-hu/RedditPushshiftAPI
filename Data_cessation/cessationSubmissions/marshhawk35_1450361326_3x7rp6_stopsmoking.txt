Day 4 and the creepy crawlies

First post after lurking. Just making some accountability for myself. I'm 35 and have smoked 1/2 pack a day for 14 years. I hate the habit, but that didn't stop me. I would quit constantly only to end up digging through the trash to find the pack I threw away. I've felt like an utter failure over this for a long time.

Anyways I came down with a horrible case of bronchitis, verging on pneumonia, about 5 days ago. Normally I'd still be out hacking up a lung while puffing away, somehow convincing myself that I'll breathe better after a cigarette. This time, I let myself just really FEEL my body straining to breathe and choking on each cough. Honestly, it scared the shit out of me. Four days ago, I said no more and I went CT. For the first time in quitting, I have admitted that I am an addict in recovery. And you know what? I don't have to feel ashamed about that. None of us do. In fact, it pisses me off enough that I feel extra motivated and I (almost) have started enjoying this process.

So I'm feeling pretty good on day 4 despite the bronchitis. The one thing I could do without is this creepy-crawly feeling all over my skin. Especially my arms and legs. It started yesterday and kept me up all night. Has anyone else dealt with that?

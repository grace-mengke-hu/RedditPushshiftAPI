Should I return to NRT?

Hi all, created a post yesterday saying that I've been feeling extremely irritated constantly. Exercise does help, but I feel completely shattered today. 20 a day smoker for 10 years.

Today is day 8 for me. Going cold turkey. 

I'm going to be straight. I'm feeling crappy, and I'm currently stressed out about work, relationships, other commitments. Waking up with low energy and feeling rough throughout the day. This is so unlike the first few days for me.

Right now, I am looking at my stash of nicotine gum. If I'm feeling this awful, should I just take them? Is nicotine really that bad? How successful are NRT quitters compared to cold turkey ones?
 
Thanks in advance.

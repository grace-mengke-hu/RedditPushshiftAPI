Back to smoking a pack a day

I thought I had quit for good. For a good while I was completely cured, or so I thought. Even the faint smell of smoke disgusted me, and I pitied friends who were still hooked. But deep in my mind, the nicotine monster still lurked. It was not dead but just bidding its time to return. This monster has a mind of its own and will do anything to try to convince you that a single cigarette won't hurt you.

- you already beat it. Go ahead and enjoy one with the boys. You understand how it works and you are in control.
- life is so unfair. You deserve to indulge yourself once in a while. We all die anyways.
- what's so nasty about cigarettes anyways? It didn't hurt you all the years you smoked.
- wife thinks you are shit? Show her you don't care and let her watch in horror as you pick the habit up again.
- don't you remember all the good times we had together?
- oh you quit a few days? See, how easy it was? Now, how about a smoke for old times sake?

I have let the monster trick me. Constantly. And now, I dont have the courage to fight it all over again.

Most days I am smoking mindlessly, but some days I have the courage to stand up to it or at least question its motivation.

How do I beat this monster once and for all?

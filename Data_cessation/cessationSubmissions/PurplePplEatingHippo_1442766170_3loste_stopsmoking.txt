I messed up.

I'm on mobile and I haven't got the hang of formatting so sorry for wall of text.

Alright guys, this is a first for me. First time in my life I have ever smoked a cigarette because of someone else. I'll give ya some background of my night last night. 

My buddy and his s/o came down to visit, haven't seen em in a month, my buddies girl suffers from severe depression and got so drunk/depressed last weekend she almost hung herself, the rope was too long. So anyways last night we were supposed to go out get some grub and hit a bar for a few drinks. So what do they do? They pregame before picking me up, my buddy had mebbe 6 shots out of a 26 while he let his gf finish the 26 she was so drunk it wasn't even funny. Anyways I'm like alright let's go, get to the resturant, have to leave right away because she's sick, by this point I've already had about 3 smokes because I'm sitting there fuuming I'm so mad and disappointed that they, well more that he would let her get this drunk and I wasn't going to say anything because she's only been on meds for a week, not like they are helping right away. Currently chiefing down smokes because I don't know anyway else to process, toking didn't help only made it worse. I'm so fucking upset it isn't even funny. Sorry for the rant I just got nowhere else to turn.

Edit: this would've been day 4, going to the station where I bought my pack to get them to toss it out otherwise i feel like I'll dumpsterdive for it.
Edit2: a word

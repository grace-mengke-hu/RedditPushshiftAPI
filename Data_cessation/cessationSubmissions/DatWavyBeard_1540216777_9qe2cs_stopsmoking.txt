One year!

Absolutely unbelievable. I was CERTAIN I wouldn't have made it. Yet, one year later, here we are!

Thank you guys, you've been very helpful. In times of distress, especially the first couple of months, I have definitely relied on your precious support and advice.

Today I believe it's possible to free yourself from this deadly habit. I am sure everyone can.

Good luck everyone!

Almost two weeks smoke free and I'm coughing like a chain smoker.

As already said, I've been smoke free for about two weeks now after smoking for about 7-8 years. I started coughing up my life, it seems, for a few days now. Also had a bloody nose for the first time in about a decade (cleaned the whole house same day, so I assume it has something to do with irritation). Anyone else have this happen? I do vape, but I hydrate fairly well (about 3 liters of water a day minimum) since vaping will dehydrate the hell out of you.

YES!!! After trying for SO long, I finally managed to quit!

I quit for a week now, and have replaced my smoking habit with exercising a lot - and I take good care of myself in general, which is something that is pretty new to me.

I feel like I have changed the balance in my life, like I am growing exponentially - the more I invest in building something good for myself, the less inclined I feel to make bad choices such as smoking.

My goal is to get rid of old patterns of behavior that do not serve me anymore and replace them with good ones. Smoking is just one of dozens of such behaviors, but I tackle them one by one. I focus on taking positive steps each day, and enjoying each day as much as I can.

One thing that I will do from now on, is a triathlon every month. I have already done like 7 of them, but my last one was last November and though I did pretty decently, I did not train very hard and I smoked. Now I am training very hard, I do not smoke and I am also losing weight (so I will be much lighter than back then). I still have 14 weeks to train, so let's see where that gets me.

The race includes a 5k, I intend to win that part. Will try to run a 5k right after finishing this post.

It feels like the sky is the limit now. I am curious where I will be in a few months time! I may be a bit overenthusiastic about exercise, but I won't apologize, I feel very much alive and hopeful, which is a feeling I was lacking for a long time.

Okay. Day One. Again!

I tried and failed miserably yesterday. I think I made it for 17 hours but cracked when I got home as I let the cravings just get the better of me. 

Today, I'm feeling slightly different. Last night I had my final cigarette, so I've been free about 11 hours at this point. I have an e-cig in my pocket, more as a comfort blanket than anything as I've not used it yet. I can definitely notice the lack of nicotine though. Certainly feeling a bit spaced out, but I've not had any overwhelming cravings yet. I am finding myself thinking of ways to justify having a cigarette at some point too! 

Wish me luck.

Title picture suggestion.

I've been thinking that this title picture is probably not the most motivating thing to be looking at when you're down in the dumps about smoking and seeking online encouragement and advice. 

It shows a lit cigarette (albeit stamped out), but it's clearly a trigger to see for us, and it focuses on what we're missing, not what we're gaining. How about a healthy pair of lungs on Snoo ?

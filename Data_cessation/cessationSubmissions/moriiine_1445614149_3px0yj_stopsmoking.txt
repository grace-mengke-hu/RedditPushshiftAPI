I got some great news to finally kick this awful habit.

So I quit for a couple of weeks back in September.  I thought I was doing great but then I slowly started to bum a couple here and there from friends.  Next thing I know, I have a pack in my purse.  Well of that changed this week when I found out that I'm pregnant!  The pregnancy was a total shock but I'm thankful it happened so I can finally free myself from this dreadful habit.

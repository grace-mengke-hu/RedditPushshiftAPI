I just smoked my last cigarette. I'm scared.

My friend shared a cigarette with me. It was the last one we have. Had. Wow, I really feel weird. It wasn't satisfying. I have been smoking fewer and fewer cigarettes over the past few days and I have not been getting that relaxed, soothing calm that usually comes after I exhale. I need some support to make it through the night and I don't know what it is going to be like tomorrow.

No one around me is supportive

Hello everyone, so I'm 18 and trying to quit smoking mainly to prevent future health problems. I was smoke free for 6 days until yesterday. I smoked only one, and didn't fully relapse. But no one around me is pushing me to quit. This is what my mom told me the day after she saw me smoking cigarettes outside of our house:

"If you're a regular smoker, you can smoke cigs around me as long as you don't overdo it"

She smokes about 3 packs every week and I think hearing these words from someone who's supposed to care about me the most (that's what she tells me) is pretty messed up. Same thing with my grandpa, he thinks life is a big joke and he wants me to enjoy it as much as possible.

I'm also having a lot of problems about my senior year in high school, I'm emotionally unstable all day every day and I honestly feel lost. I'm thinking about seeing a psychologist but I'd like to ask you guys for quitting advice for one last time before I do so, maybe you can help me. Thanks!

I am 22, I started smoking since I was 15. Today is the beginning of my journey to quit smoking...

My feeling to quit started when my friend said that he heard me through a closed door in the hallway of our office. He asked "were you in the hallway just before?" I was shocked and said yeah, thinking he had some super power. He said "oh yeah I heard 'your' cough". This instantly brought me to my childhood when if I couldn't find my dad with my brothers in a store or public place we would just listen to find my dad by his cough, we would hear it and follow the cough. This just really hit me hard and now it has to stop.

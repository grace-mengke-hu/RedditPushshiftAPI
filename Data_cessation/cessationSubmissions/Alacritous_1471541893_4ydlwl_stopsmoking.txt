I used smoking to fill in all the gaps when I wasn't doing anything. I'm a day into quitting(with patch). I haven't had a cigarette for 24 hours now and god damn, I'm so bored.

I know, I need to keep myself busy. But I didn't realize exactly how integrated smoking was with my daily routine.  I usually smoked about 1/2 pack to a pack a day.  I'm 47 and been smoking for 32 years.

You can do it as log as you want to.

For all the New Years resolution quitters who are quitting I want to wish you good luck and tell you you can as long as you want to

It's been a while now (153 days ) without smoking after about 11 years of smoking fairly heavily, I feel a lot better, can run a lot further and I imagine smell a lot better.

If I can do it you can do it. Happy new year!

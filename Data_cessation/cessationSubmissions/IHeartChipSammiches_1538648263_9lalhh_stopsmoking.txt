Week 3/Day 24 on Champix...still nothing. Normal?

Like the title says I'm on day 24 of Champix (Chantix I believe it's called in the US) and I'm not feeling anything. I'm very grateful that I don't feel any of the negative side effects, which I was very worried about. But I don't feel any of the intended effects, either. My urge to smoke hasn't decreased, cigarettes taste the same, I still feel fine when and after smoking. Has anyone else had this experience? 

I have an appointment with my GP the day after tomorrow to discuss this and get my next prescription. I want to be totally honest with him because I really do want to quit. Right now I feel like if I were to quit it would be cold turkey; it's as if the medication does nothing. Apparently most people feel like they no longer want to smoke after 8 days and are smoke free by 10. I feel like a failure. 

Thanks x

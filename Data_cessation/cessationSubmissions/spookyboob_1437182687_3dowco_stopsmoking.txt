Birthday party Sunday, how do you resist temptation?

Hello, all! I am on day 5 (badge says day 4 and I'm not sure how to fix?) and I'm feeling great! I'm really proud of myself, and how I've resisted so far. Unfortunately, this upcoming Sunday, my girlfriend's grandmother is having a birthday party, and their entire family smokes. I am worried about being in an environment where I am allowed (and encouraged ) to smoke openly, and in the past has been my greatest challenge. If anyone can offer any advice on how they keep strong, I'd be very thankful for any tips/help! :D

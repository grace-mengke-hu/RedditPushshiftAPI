I think I can do it this time...

It is my first day!

I have been smoking about a pack a day for a few years now... I want to 3 now. I started when I was young. I have been physically unable to smoke the past few days now, as my lungs hurt extremely bad. Every time I tried to smoke I would stop breathing... 

So, I stopped. I didn't want to, I kept trying to, but it kept hurting too bad.

Well, today I didn't even try to smoke. I didn't even look at a cigarette today! I still have a carton of smokes in the freezer, but I am handing them off to my boyfriend, no hard feelings and no regret--yet...

I think I can do it. It is going to be hard, but I think I can do it. I hope.

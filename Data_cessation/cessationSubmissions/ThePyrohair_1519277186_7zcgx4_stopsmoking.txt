I'm building something to help smoking addiction but I have multiple questions and need your advice!

Hello r/stopsmoking, I am currently building a wearable device to help with the additive behavior associated with smoking but I have few questions of why smokers or quitting smokers do what they do. 

* Lurking through this subreddit ,  I see an "app" or some sort of counter that many people post screenshots showing excellent progress. 
**What is that feature**

* What is the most powerful reason that made you want to quit?
* To those who have tried nicotine patches or gum, what did you hate/love?
* Why did you start smoking in the first place?

I sincerely thank everyone for their response, answers and their time!
Do it everyday!

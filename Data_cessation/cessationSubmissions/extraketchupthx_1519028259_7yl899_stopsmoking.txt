Anyone ever randomly quit smoking? Without really trying to start it?

I’ve been smoke free for about 3 weeks now I think. I’m not positive because I’m not sure when I stopped smoking. After half a dozen efforts to quit including gum and the patch, I quit cold turkey because I was hungover and didn’t want to smoke, and was out of cigarettes and didn’t want to buy kore. That turned into 2 or 3 days and I realized I had a little streak going and wanted to see how long I could keep it up.     Has anyone else done something similar? I’m super relieved and want to stick with it, especially now that he cravings are so much lighter.

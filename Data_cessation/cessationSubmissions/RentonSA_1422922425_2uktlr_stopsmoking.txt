Quitting Again

I have quit on and off for the past  4 years since meeting and marrying my wife.  Before that I had smoked since I was 16 (I am now 36). When we met I  was smoking a pack every other day. While dating we went out and drank weekly, and i was able to keep the smoking away. We married a little over a year ago and the drinking stopped. Smoking became an 'in the car' thing that I kept secret, maybe 5 a day.   Still got caught on occasion,  especially when I went out with friends who still drank amd smoked. Just had our first child and i quit again 5 months ago for real.  Well,  went out with friends before super bowl and bummed one, just one, and she smelled it out on me,  and now wants a divorce. Because of one cigarette.

I have always been serious about quiting. I have quit drinking when we go out. I have let friendship go with people I have known for over 15 years because of the influence they could have.  She wants that complete controll over my life and I am fine with that because I love my daughter and my wife. This time I need support other than myself (I have never gotten my wifes 'support', only her throwing pictures at me from off of the wall or hosing me down in the driveway on a 20 degree night as a way of 'helping' me). Was hoping this community could help because she says there is no way for her to help me.

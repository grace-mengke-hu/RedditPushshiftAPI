2 weeks not quite cold turkey but proud anyways.

I quit drinking 7 weeks ago. I was thinking about, while smoking a cigarette,  how I went 5 weeks without something I liked doing with little to no problems, yet I can't seem to shake something I hated doing. So I finished that cigarette and haven't smoked again. I went cold turkey for 5 days. On the 6th and 7th day I caved due to work and lack of nicotine and had a piece of nicotine gum each of the two days. Other than that I've been cold turkey. I feel as though I am doing pretty great.

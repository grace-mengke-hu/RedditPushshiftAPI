1 Week as of today!

I'm starting to cough stuff up...ew! But I've been drinking a lot of water and eating lollipops like a bitch in lieu of smoking.

Funny story, a couple of days ago a friend was having a hard time analyzing her data. She pulled her hair and said "Ugghh! I need one of your lollipops!" It made me laugh and feel better.

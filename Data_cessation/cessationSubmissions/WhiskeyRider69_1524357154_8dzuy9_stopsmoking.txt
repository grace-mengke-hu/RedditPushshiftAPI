Taste buds are awesome!

To celebrate my fourth week of being a quitter, I grilled myself a steak tonight. The weather was absolutely amazing here today. It was 70Â°f and sunny.

I grilled some ribeyes, medium rare, and my wife sauteed some green beans and baked some sweet potatoes. I paired off the steak with a nice glass of Maker's Mark 46 (no, the username isn't just random), and sat down to eat. 

OH. MY. GOD!

I could taste every seasoning on that steak. The buttery flavor of the juices swept across my tongue like a fire on the Serengeti. The nuttiness of the whiskey blended perfectly with the steak and brought a single tear to my eye that wanted so badly to trace a path down my face to my mouth where it too could lend it's salty essence to the heavenly mixture there. 

Taste buds are an amazing thing. I know that, eventually, I will get used to the heightened level they are now running at, but please, allow me to enjoy it for now. Don't judge me. 

Enjoy your Saturday night quitters. :)

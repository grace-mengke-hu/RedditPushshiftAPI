Day 3 almost done!

(or day 2 if we're using a zero-based count).

I put out my last cigarette Tuesday morning, and I'm about an hour from going to bed today (Thursday), I'm amazed that I've made it this far, and also somehow not surprised at all.  I've stuck pretty closely to the plan, and have spent the last few days working from home and marathoning Star Trek: Enterprise.   I haven't ruined any relationships with my temper, (though I did yell at the car behind me in the Sonic drive through on Tuesday. He was honking! That's a dick move!)

Thanks for your support, everyone, and I hope, nay KNOW, that I'll be posting a 7 day update in a few days!

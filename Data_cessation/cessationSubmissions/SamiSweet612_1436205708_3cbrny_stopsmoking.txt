Help! I've succeeded but I need advice.

So I'm coming up on my 2 weeks smoke-free mark on Wednesday, however people have been commenting lately that I have been incredibly irritable, moody, and angry.

Of all the times I've quit this has been the easiest and I haven't consciously felt the desire to smoke in the least. I've still been surrounded by smokers but it doesn't bother me and I actually find the smell disgusting to be around. 

I'm just wondering if anyone else has noticed some strange withdrawal symptoms without the desire to smoke again? 

Thank you all for being here to support me and to share any tips you might have!

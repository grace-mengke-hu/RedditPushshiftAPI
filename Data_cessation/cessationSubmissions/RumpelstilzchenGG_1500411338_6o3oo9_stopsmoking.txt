Quitting the cancer sticks

Hi, I just smoked my last cigarette and I decided to go full cold turkey on smoking. I've been smoking for more than 10 years with small breaks. The longest I've gone without a smoke was like a week, so I know it will be hard, but I'm honestly tired of it. I get no satisfaction from smoking anymore and I've been getting some mad coughs recently that have never happened before, so I'm kind of scared of the damage I've done to my lungs. So from today I am quitting! FUCK YOU CIGARETTES and good riddance!

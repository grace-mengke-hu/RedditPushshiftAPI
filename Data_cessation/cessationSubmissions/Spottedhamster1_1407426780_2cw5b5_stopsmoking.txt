I can't sleep

Hi guys, i've been smoking for about 15 years 1 to 1,5 pack a day. Anyway it's been 3 days and 6h since my last smoke. The biggest problem is getting sleep. The last 2 nights i woke up like every hour and i'm feeling very restless and agitated in bed. Does anybody else recognise this and when will it get better at night? I just wanna sleep.

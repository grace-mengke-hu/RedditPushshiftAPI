10 days, and my lungs obligate me to continue.

i've tried many times, but now I'm determined!
10 days looks to me like a whole year but I'm feeling better and I already hate the smell of smoke. 
I had 5 penumothorax in my life despite my young age (27) so i just can't smoke! 
looking for some support here :P

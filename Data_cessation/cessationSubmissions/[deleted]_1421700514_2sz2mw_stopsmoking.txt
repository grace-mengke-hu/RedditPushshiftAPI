Smoked my last 5 cigs today, don't want to buy another pack

how do you do it?  I'm about 20 minutes into it, so not anything big.  I know I WANT to quit as much as a I  NEED to.  In an hour or two I'm worried I'm gonna go to the 7/11.  I have nicotine gum too that I might chew later.  But how do you do it!?!?!  I've tried dozens of times in the past, I smoke about a pack a day.  One time I made it 9 months, most of the time it's a few hours to a few days.

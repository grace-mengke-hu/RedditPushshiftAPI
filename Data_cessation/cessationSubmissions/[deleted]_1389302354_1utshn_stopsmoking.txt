The reason I quit is gone and I am barely holding on for someone else's sake. [Trigger Warning - Loss]

I quit the beginning of last month when I found out I was pregnant. I was a pack a day smoker and had been smoking for ten years. I was (am?) in love with smoking.

I'm kind of over sharing due to needing to talk it out, so hopefully that's okay, but I miscarried this past summer, and fell into a bad depression that lasted since. I was in therapy and medicated. 

So when I was suprised by this rainbow baby it was as if the depression lifted and I felt so happy 

I began miscarrying this pregnancy on Sunday and most people aren't aware that it takes a painful few days or weeks. I am still in the middle of the process and am in pain right now. I have been distraught and angry.

Today I went out alone for the first time since and all I can think about is that I want to smoke. The cravings today are very strong.

The only reason I haven't is because my boyfriend is so happy I quit regardless and I know he will be very disappointed in me. I want to self destruct right now but I haven't just so he doesn't have to feel any more pain  than he already has.

I just need help, how do I get past these cravings? I am fantasizing buying a pack. I want to smoke in the patio and sit at the window and be relaxed and look at things/people/cars instead of sleeping through cravings or watching tv. I don't want all this free time or all this food  instead. I am resenting everyone including my boyfriend for not allowing me this comfort, which is stupid and unfair, I know. Sorry for the vent. Thanks.

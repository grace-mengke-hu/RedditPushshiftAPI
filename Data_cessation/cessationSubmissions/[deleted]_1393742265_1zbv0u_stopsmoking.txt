I fucked up. Day 10.

So my tenth consecutive day without cigarettes (longest ever) happened to be my friend's 21st. I'm sure y'all can fill in the rest from there. I had one. One single fucking cigarette. It felt so good, and I hated myself as soon as I threw it out. This is rough, guys. I had a "light" smoking habit before - only about five cigarettes a day, or two packs a week - and it's this fucking hard to leave them in the dust. I can only imagine what some of you with more developed addictions are going through. Y'all are stronger men than I.

For what it's worth, take it from me that if you've put your mind to quitting, you WILL hate yourself after smoking one if you do. So remember that while just one cigarette may feel nice, you will regret it immediately afterward. Please believe me, you will. Stay strong.

I will reset my badge when I am sober enough to do so. Hey, I didn't give up alcohol ;)

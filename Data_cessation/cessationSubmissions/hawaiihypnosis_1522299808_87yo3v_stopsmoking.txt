What are your perceived benefits and fears about quitting smoking?

When I was smoking, one of my biggest fears was  not only letting myself down, but everyone else as well.

I was scared to death of failing once again to quit for good and getting sucked back into the nicotine trap.

I had failed numerous times before, and couldn't bear screwing up again and letting my friends and family down all over again.

Have you ever been so ashamed that you've hid out in a garage just so your family wouldn't or your kids wouldn't see you?

That was me for the longest time.

Another fear / thought I had for the longest time was "how can I live life without smoking?"

It becomes such a part of you, you start to identify with the cigarettes.

This fear prevented me from stopping for the longest time.

When I mentioned benefits in the title of this post, I don't necessarily mean the kind of benefits you might be thinking of (health benefits, etc.).

I'm talking about emotional benefits.

For example, I saw my cigarettes as a dear friend that was there for me through thick and thin.

Little did I know they were the cause of my misery.

Another benefit was I got plenty of smoke breaks at work.  

And yet another benefit was the emotional support when I was going through a rough patch.  The best part?  They were the friend that wouldn't disagree with me if I was in the wrong with a fight with my wife or any other argument.

Now for some good news - I finally quit smoking 2.5 years ago :)

So despite how you feel, it can be done and were rooting for you!

What are / were your biggest fears?  Also what kind of things did smoking do for you that you saw as a bonus at the time?

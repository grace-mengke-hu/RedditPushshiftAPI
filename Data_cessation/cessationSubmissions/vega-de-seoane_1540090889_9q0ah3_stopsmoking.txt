I am quitting smoking for the sixth time. THIS TIME I ' m gonna finally get it! But can someone tell me tricks for the abstinence?thanks!😊

I' ts horrible!! I hate smoking since I was a baby. I was always telling to my parents: STOP SMOKING 🚬 🚭!but then when I was 24 ( now  I am 30 ) my brother in law got me into this shit.
So I now, after trying 5 times to stop smoking, now I 'm not smoking for 7 days: a week!!!! 
I CANNOT BELIEVE IT! But it's so hard and difficult... I need help please with tricks that I can use when I can't stand myself. And believe me that for example I am able to run as fast as I can to buy cigarettes. They suck. 

I went to the pulmonologist, and he told me that I am almost having an EPOC. 
So my lungs ar not so good , huh... 

BUT NOW IT IS A GREAT DAY BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN NOT SMOKING FOR A WEEK!!!
It's something that I thought I could not done.
So people come one,let's get rid of tobacco and smoking and being a slave of it. 
Please tell me tricks. 
Cheer up, send you all 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽

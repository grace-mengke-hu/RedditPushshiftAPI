Day 5, and it’s unusually warm and sunny in England. My cravings haven’t been stronger and all I can think about is walking to the shop and buying tobacco and sitting in my garden smoking.

I’m currently on the train back to where I live after staying with family for a few days, and I’m really, really struggling with cravings. I really don’t know what to do. I haven’t used any nicotine replacement gum or patches or anything so far - complete cold turkey. 

I was thinking about getting an e-cig with the lowest nicotine content I could find but I’m not sure if that’s the cravings speaking!!

I’ve also been invited to a barbecue later and I know there will be at least two smokers there, and while I want to go and see my friends I’m not ready to be around cigarette smoke and cigarettes (unless I had an e-cig maybe? idk :()

My boyfriend thinks if I get an ecig I’ll smoke the ecig through the week then end up smoking cigarettes at the weekend if I have a drink. 

Sorry this is all a complete nonsense scramble, I’ve got the worst headache (had them since quitting!!)

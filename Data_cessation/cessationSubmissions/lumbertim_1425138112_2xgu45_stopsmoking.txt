I messed up yesterday

Hey everyone,

I feel like venting for a little bit. I messed up yesterday. I'm 23 years old and have been smoking since I was 13. I have been trying to quit for almost a year now, and every time I try I just can't make it past the first day. Before I go to bed I usually get really nervous and anxious and cave.

So, for the first time ever, I experienced succes. I managed to not smoke for six days. That's the longest I have ever gone without smoking since I started. Yesterday I went out to dinner with a friend. Had a great time, laughed a lot and drank a bottle of wine. After dinner she went for a smoke, and I just couldn't help thinking that I was in the clear after six days. Rationally I knew that was bullshit, but I couldn't help myself and I smoked a cigarette.

I feel so dissapointed in myself right now, and feel like I will never be able to kick this thing for good. I smoked another cigarette just now, and feel like I'm back at zero. The reason I just smoked is because I have to work tonight (I'm a bartender), and those times are the hardest on me, as it's the only time I feel like it's legitimate to take a break.

I'm trying to look at the positive side, and keep in mind that I did  it for six days once, so I can do it again.

After tonight I'm going to quit again. I want it to be for good. I don't want to be a smoker, I don't want to spend money on killing myself and I want to live a healthy and full life, without being a slave to this goddamn plant. 

I hope the rest of you are having a great smoke-free day. Stay strong new-quiters, and just keep at it old-quiters! Thank you for reading.

Has anyone noticed unpleasant feelings/revelations/things you've avoided thinking about popping up since quitting (also: an update from the doctor for those who were interested)

So I have noticed a lot of things bobbing to the surface over the last couple weeks.  I have heard opiate addicts and others say that they have had the same issues when they stopped using.  Has this happened to anyone else?  Is smoking really this powerful?  

As for the doc: no COPD, I have a cold, and allergies are kicking in early.  BP was only a little elevated, chest is pretty clear.  The chest pain was anxiety, and I need to start taking my anxiety meds like I'm supposed to.  It's been too hot to do my tea and blanket routine, which usually keeps the stress at bay.  But I am good, thank you for those who were worried :)

I’m done with the Juul!

Now that my state just passed a tax on Juul pods that has literally doubled their price, vaping isn’t sustainable anymore. That device fucking sucks, and tomorrow morning is going to be my first real attempt at quitting on my own, now that I’m out of pods. I’m posting this so that I can look back at it when I want to be reminded why I can’t go back. 

What are the advantages? You get a head rush? Helps you deal with your social anxiety? 

The disadvantages: you seem ridiculous being the only one hitting it at work or in certain social circles, you’re dependent on a little object, people always ask you for hits, money gone down the drain, leads to more anxiety, too much of your habits and life revolves around accommodating it. 

I’m gonna chew gum and coach myself through this. From a pod a day to none a day, cold turkey. If I can do this, I can do anything!

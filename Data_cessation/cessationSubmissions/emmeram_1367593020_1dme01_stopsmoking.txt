a Monday 2 months and 12 days from today i quit smoking

according to http://daycalc.appspot.com/02/18/2013. 
If you're thinking about quitting smoking, just do it. I smoked around a pack a day for 3 years. Now, after quitting, I smell better (both concerning the sense of smelling as well as my body odor), I feel like I'm fucking rich and (as a guitar player and singer) my singing has improved greatly. Little to no withdrawal symptoms at my current stage. I wasn't really convinced of doing it but my friends kept telling me to just do it and I did and here I am. Just do it, that's the best advice really.

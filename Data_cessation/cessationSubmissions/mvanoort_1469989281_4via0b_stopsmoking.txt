So I fucked up last week and had 2 smokes, but I haven't had one since.

Found a full pack of smokes last week after 5 days of no smoking. I caved on Tuesday and smoked two, but then I threw the rest of the pack out the car window. Haven't had one since. Friday night I was at a party with about 12 people chain smoking for hours, and I still managed not to partake. Felt pretty good about myself when I got home.

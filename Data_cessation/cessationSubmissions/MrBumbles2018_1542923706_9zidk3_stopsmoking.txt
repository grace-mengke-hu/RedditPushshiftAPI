What has helped with cravings

Going for walks - takes my mind of the craving plus have some tunes on so a bit of a treat at the same time 

Looking at pictures of my family - want to be around for the them

Thinking of what Iâ€™m going to spend the money on, so much stuff I want to buy and do with it

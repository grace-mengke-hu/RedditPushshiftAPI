Smoker, addict, non smoker or ex smoker?

Someone I know well recently asked me after 6 month of no smoking how I see myself / would describe my relationship with nicotine.

Interestingly I still internally identify as a smoker and an addict that doesn't have cigs.

My thinking is I will never be able to control my habit to just the odd tab, if I had 1 I'd be back to 20 + a day straight away.

So how do you self identify.  Has your view changed over time?

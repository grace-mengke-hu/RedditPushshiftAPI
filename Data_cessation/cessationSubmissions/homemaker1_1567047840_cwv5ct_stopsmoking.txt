I should stop but the desire isn't strong enough

I know I should stop... I have pain in my throat and it's getting worse. I am fucked. I think I'm slightly depressed. I don't have much hope in my future. I am looking for that slight relief I get with a cig. It's not even that drastic. I don't know why I keep doing it. It's not like I feel any better.

Just airing this out. I've never done this before.

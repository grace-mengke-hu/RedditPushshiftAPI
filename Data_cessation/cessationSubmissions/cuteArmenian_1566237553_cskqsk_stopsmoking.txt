Had a dream where I smoked a pack...felt like a nightmare

It's been 5 days and honestly seems like a month without cigarettes. I know I am doing the right thing but my brain won't stop making me question it every second I get cravings. 

Yesterday, I saw a dream where I started smoking again and binged a whole pack. Right after, I felt so bad and disappointed in myself. So when I woke up, it was such a relief !!! Weirdly enough, this has also kind of made me more confident in ditching my cravings, since I know I'd feel horrible if I gave in.

This is also my second attempt at quitting and I am having a much harder time because I want this to be my final try...

Do not feel good

Hey

Got myself to day 12. Pretty stoked by that and fully committed to going on. 

But my god my body is fighting me hard. 

I struggle with IBS after getting food poisoning 6 years ago so even though I knew quitting was the best thing to do I was always nervous about the potential reaction. I was right to be nervous I feel terrible. 

I'm either bunged up or faster than usain bolt (I hope you get the analogy)

Damn I hope this settles down soon.

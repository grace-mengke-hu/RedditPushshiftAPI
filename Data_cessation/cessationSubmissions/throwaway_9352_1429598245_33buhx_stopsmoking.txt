I'm at 19 days, and I've been coughing up blood since last night. Is this normal...?

FYI I was a moderate (10-15 a day) smoker for only 2 years. Last night I coughed up a little bit of blood, but I didn't really think anything about it. I went for a run this morning and I came back coughing lots more. Help guys... did anyone else go through this?

Edit: Also I can feel a lump developing in the left side of my throat and it's kind of painful when I touch it. I don't know what it is.

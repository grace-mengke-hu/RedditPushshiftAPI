Difficulty breathing after just 3 months of 5-cig-a-day habit scared me into quitting. Anybody else experienced effects this early ?

I started smoking out of pure curiosity (at the age of 25) to see if it would have any benefits in productivity or something. Then, one day, I had to breathe through the mouth the entire day trying to get enough air. This continued for 2 days. I was fine on the third day. I had never had such an experience like this before. That scared me into quitting.

Now, I'm off them for 2 weeks now. But is it normal to feel such effects that early in the smoking habit ? I thought it took years of pack-a-day smoking to have difficulty breathing ?

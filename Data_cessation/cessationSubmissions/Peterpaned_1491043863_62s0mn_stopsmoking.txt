Split personalities of quitting.

Quitting smoking has been on my mind for quite a while. I use up all of my spending money on cigarettes, I smell like crap after a smoke, and I'm obviously not as healthy as I could be. I know I must quit. At the same time I go through periods where I say " screw it, I enjoy smoking. Why torture myself?"
Lately my going back and forth has been ridiculous. I'll throw a nicotine patch on before work. I'll be exited and tell myself that I'm definitely done with cigarettes. If I have any remaining in the pack I'll destroy them. But then after work I completely shift and rationalize with myself that smoking is enjoyable. There are toxins in our food, water, air, etc. We're all on our way to death. I'm gonna enjoy myself while I'm here.

Is this back and forth attitude common with anyone else? How did you deal with it?

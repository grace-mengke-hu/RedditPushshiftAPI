Stop smoking 2 week Update.

So i posted here a few week's ago about picking up Champix stop smoking tablets.

On my follow up visit to the doctor on Thursday i blew 16 into the machine that detects carbon from smoking, two weeks earlier i blew 33.

I was supposed to quit smoking today but im just not at that place yet, i felt myself getting extremely irritated and everything was winding me up, however i smoke maybe 3 or 4 cigs a day currently \( down from 20, 25 \). I have only had 2 today entirely and woke up at 8am. I still feel i need my Morning cig more than anything, after that i am completely fine and don't really get cravings. My partner smokes and thus when she goes for a cig my brain is used to saying "Oh, ill have one too" so it's difficult to ignore that.

At this point it's more habit than craving, if i can just beat the initial morning craving \( I can last maybe 2 or 3 hours in the morning before i become ratty and irritated \) ill quit. Any day now i hope.

Some of the side\-affects i have had, Very very real nightmares almost nightly. Lucid dreaming also \( I can control my dreams, even nightmares \) but i can't turn a nightmare into a good dream but when i have a nice dream my god is it good, i can become a billionaire by thought it's really weird. Had some mood swings but nothing too severe, worth continuing at this point. Will update again in 2 weeks. If i don't eat before i take the tablets i get horrendous stomach cramps that last until i eat. 

Something to note, i also smoke weed Daily but i'm just a night time user, Only after 10PM and only 2 or 3 spliffs to relax and go to sleep. \( Maybe affecting how fast the tablets work? \)

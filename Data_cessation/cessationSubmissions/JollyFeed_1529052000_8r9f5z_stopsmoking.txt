Good-Bye Heck Week

This is the longest I've been smoke-free. The days have gotten to be blander as my milestones are further apart and less noteworthy overtime. My new normal is starting to set in day by day. I still get urges but they're less frequent and go away quickly. I guess the blahs are starting to hit me.

Smoking my last cigarette

I'm smoking my last cigarette as I'm typing this.  I've quit cold turkey before and it lasted about eight months.  Unfortunately I started smoking a pack a day again, and this has been going on for almost a year. Although I relapsed and got right back in to old habits I feel like I can ,and will quit again. This time for good. Does anybody have any tips or suggestions to fight cravings for the first couple weeks? Thanks in advance.

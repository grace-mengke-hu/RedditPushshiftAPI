Removing and restarting. Tomorrow, the 26th, is my real quit day.

This is my third time quitting and I just need a good thought to keep in my head to keep me from smoking, to fight the nicotine cravings and keep pushing.

I go on runs and I work out. My friends and family all think I'm already done, but I keep buying packs and smoking in private but I hate it. I hate lying about it and thinking that smoking helps, when I know it doesn't. 

Please link articles and rants and slap me in the face over the internet. Please and thank you.

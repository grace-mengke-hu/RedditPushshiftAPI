Resetting my Badge - I'm full-blown addicted again. It stops again today.

I've done it before and stayed clean for half a year. Then I took another puff... and another... and bought a pack... and another... and another... and I started rolling my own cigarettes again. I screwed up, but I've quit before and I'm quitting again today. Tonight I will smoke my last one, and then I'll destroy all tobacco I have left.

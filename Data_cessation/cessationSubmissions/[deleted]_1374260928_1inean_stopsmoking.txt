Remind me why I'm doing this?

I've been smoke free over a month now. After 8 years it was actually kind of easy this, I haven't really had any cravings, I've been able to go out drinking. I just miss it. I feel like I'm missing out on something fun. I really enjoy smoking. I'm young and have no children so it's hard to focus on health benefits. I'm a nurse I've cared for end stage copd patients on 24 hr o2 but I just can't seem to use that as motivation. I just want to smoke but this is so far my best quitting effort and I don't want to fuck that up. Remind me why I want to do this

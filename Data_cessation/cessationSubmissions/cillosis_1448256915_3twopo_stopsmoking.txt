How to get past first day?

I have restarted the quit timer on my stop smoking app more times than I can count. I cringe when I see people saying they have been quit for a week or more because I can't even make it 24 hours without driving myself nuts. I really feel like if I can make it 3 days I will be able to get a handle on it, but I'm really struggling. Any tips for day one quitting? I've read Alan Carr and even have his audio book. I've tried patches and ecigarettes.

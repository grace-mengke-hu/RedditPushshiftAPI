Three months!

I quit at midnight on June 21st, the summer solstice.

At midnight tonight, the autumnal equinox, it will be 3 months since my last smoke.

I wore the patch for a week, so almost all of it has been nicotine-free!  I believe I was helped quite a bit by a kind of unconventional experience, eventually I plan to make a post discussing it.

But for now, just sharing my pride for making it a quarter of a year.  Feels good, man!

I've been giving in

Last July I made the decision to quit smoking for good. Somehow around January I would go to parties and have an occasional cigarette and now I'm smoking either my mom's or my friend's cigarettes. I still haven't bought my own pack but I don't want to bum or smoke. What's something that will motivate me now as much as I was motivated back when I quit? I desperately don't want to start the disgusting habit again but the nicotine withdrawal makes it hard.

So I failed ...

But I'm not giving up!

I've never felt this willpower to quit smoking!
I know that I smoked when I was trying to wuit, but at the same time I've managed to reduce the number of daily cigarretes to 2, when the average was 15! So I face that as small victory! 

The nicotine income was reduced.... so I believe that my body will request less nicotine if I don't increase the number of cigarretes per day!

This weekend I'll try to not smoke at all! I'm hoping to succeed!!

Wish me luck! :) And thank you all for the motivation YOU gave me!

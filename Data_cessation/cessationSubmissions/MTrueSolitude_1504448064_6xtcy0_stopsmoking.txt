22, trying to quit

Hey guys

I've been smoking roughly 1 to 2 packs a day since 18. And I think it's because I'm young I'm still relatively healthy however the side effects are catching up to me. I'm finding it harder and harder to breath. My voice sounds like shit. My breathe smells. So many obvious problems with smoking but finding it difficult to quit. 

Any advice??

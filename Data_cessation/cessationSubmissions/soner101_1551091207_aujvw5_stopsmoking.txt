Here is what happened when I started smoking again.

Hello r/stopsmoking. Here is a brief story of the effects smoking has had on me after I quit for 8 months. 

After I quit i realized some of the changes it had on my health. Once i started up again I realized even more of the problems smoking has caused me. Here is the list:

1. I started using my inhaler again
2. A lot of mucus in my throat and nasal passages
3. Stuffy nose all the time
4. Energy level not at peak
5. Trouble sleeping
6. Poor blood circulation in arms and legs when sitting or laying for long periods
7. Libido decreased
8. Sense of smell not as good
9. Trouble breathing when doing extraneous activities at work and home
10. Self-care doesnâ€™t feel as important any more
11. I now rely on cigarettes as a coping mechanism for stress and emotions instead of dealing with it in a constructive manner


Im sure i am forgetting something. My point to this is that smoking harms you physically, mentally, and emotionally. It is an abusive relationship. I am determined to quit once i get back from this deployment and hopefully stay a nonsmoker this time. 

For all of you out there struggling just remember it is worth it being a nonsmoker. You will feel and think better then you can imagine. You can do it!

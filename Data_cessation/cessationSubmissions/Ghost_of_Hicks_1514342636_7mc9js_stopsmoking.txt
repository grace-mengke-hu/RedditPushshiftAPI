Karaoke skin crawl.

I'm at 11 days. My wife, who insisted that I quit, wants to go to karaoke tomorrow night. I'm usually fine with that, but I always smoke 3 or 4 times as much there. I am already crawling out of my skin. I feel unsupported. I may stab someone with the microphone.

Maybe I drop her off and go see a movie. Joking. I have to be present. Mostly, I am enraged at the lack of understanding. She thinks I should be all fixed by now.

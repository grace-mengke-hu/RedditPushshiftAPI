Today is my birthday - smoke free

Today is my birthday (2/16), I get a new zero at the end of my age (and I could use a hug and reminder that I'm not old!!).

This will also be my first birthday since I was 12 or 13 years old that I will not be smoking, which I'm very proud of. I'm the first in my direct family to ever quit smoking (before smoking quit me) and hopefully that breaks the curse forever. Today I'll be celebrating alone, missing some people who would certainly be happy to be here, some who would be able to wish me a happy birthday still if they just didn't smoke. 

I have steps to take getting my life back on track still, it's amazing how fast you can go from working, going to graduate school, having a girlfriend, a nice car, being in shape, feeling healthy and mentally strong, to having none of those things and wondering where the last 15 years went. I really feel that cigarettes fogged my mind, made me extremely tired, and put me on the long and slow withdraw into becoming a near total recluse. 

I feel like I've come out of a deep, dark dream now that my brain is awake and the nicotine is gone. It was tremendously difficult at first, waves of mental energy that made me so anxious. I'm telling you all, we were SLAVES to nicotine. There is a certain something to the freedom from it that I just can't put to words, it will empower you. You'll feel reborn, the teenage you full of energy and dreams will reappear in your conscience wondering why you dulled him/her into a trance for so long. I'm finally thinking about tomorrow again. All you have to do is get through the few weeks or months that it takes to get comfortable in the new, smoke free you. 

Thanks for all the support and encouragement. I don't know how the hell I'm going to get myself a vehicle and get myself back in gear, but I'm going to do it now, cuz if I can quit smoking ---- I can do anything!!!!!

Cheers!

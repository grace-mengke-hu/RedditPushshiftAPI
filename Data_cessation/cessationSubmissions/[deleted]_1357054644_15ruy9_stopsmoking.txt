How can I fight "boredom" smoking?

When I'm home I tend not too smoke much at all, sometimes getting by on about five cigarettes a day. However, due to horrendous commuting, my smoking skyrockets to a pack on these days, usually lighting up one right after I finished the previous. While I wasn't in an immediate rush to quit, my boyfriend has made me one of those "if you stop smoking, then..."-offers I can't refuse.


The only thing that worries me is that I will get horrendously bored while waiting for my buses to show up and light up one regardless. What is the best way to simulate the kind of distraction boredom smoking brings?

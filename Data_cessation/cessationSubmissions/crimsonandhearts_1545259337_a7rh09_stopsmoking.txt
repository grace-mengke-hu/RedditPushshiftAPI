Something funny I remembered from when I first quit

So, I’ve seen a lot of posts saying that people are experiencing a lot more mood swings or that they’re extremely emotional after quitting, and it reminded me of my first week of quitting. 

I think it was day 5-7 for me and my boyfriend &amp; I went to a bar with some friends. I thought it wasn’t a great idea but I wanted to get out of the house. We get there, we go outside on the patio where people can smoke but luckily not too many people are. I’m drinking a lot and getting my drunk on, having a good time, when a friend of a friend comes and sits next to me and pulls out her pack, and I’m like....oh fuck. I told her I quit this week. She pulls out a smoke and says “is it okay if I smoke then?” I look at her and instead of saying something rude like I wanted to say, I say..sure. Let’s see if I can deal with this. Low and behold, I did. But I wanted one. So badly. *so badly* 

We left the bar a few hours later and I was pretty wasted, happy that I could control myself and didn’t smoke....until I ask my boyfriend to stop at McDonald’s because I was hungry and wanted to get something to sober up. We pull up and the drive thru line is unusually long....and I *lost* it. I sat in his car and sobbed so hard that I actually scared my boyfriend. I sobbed like someone killed my cat in front of me. I couldn’t stop. I cried for 30 minutes. It was insane. I didn’t want to cry, but it just came out. 

I think I realized weeks later that I had so much emotion pent up that I covered up with smoking that I had to just let out. I think I was grieving. Literally grieving the loss of *cigarettes* 
So, to those who May feel over emotional, a little crazy, it’s okay. *it will pass* i promise :)

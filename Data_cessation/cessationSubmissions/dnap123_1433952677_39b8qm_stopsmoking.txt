It's time to quit. I'm going to be setting goals. My first one is simple.

Limit smoking on the morning drive to work to one cigarette. The commute is about 45 minutes on the highway so one cigarette isn't impossible but it won't be easy. Then next goal isn't bad. For now, I will be allowing a cigarette at lunchtime, but if I smoke the cigarette at lunchtime I can't smoke two on the way home. If I smoke two on the way home anyway, then that's it for the day. None after that.

What do you guys think about this approach?

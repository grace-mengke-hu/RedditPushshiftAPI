My mission today was to write down things that helped me quit and why I think it helped me.

What Has Worked For Me While Quitting Smoking and Why

1. String cheese sticks the first few days (smoky and pepper). - I think this worked for me because you pull them apart to eat them, so it distracted me, and gave me a savory treat.

2. Dark Chocolate M&amp;Ms the first few days- this helped me because it gave me a sweet treat to munch on. 

3. Mints and gum - it worked for me because I felt like the mint helped lower my craving and make it easier to deal with. 

4. Puzzles and quick phone games - it serves as a distraction for getting through a bad craving. It gets my mind on something other than wanting to smoke.

5. A new sleep schedule - getting into a newer routine without smoking is making me crave and think about smoking less.

6. Diet and exercise - changing how I eat, and exercising daily had made me more health conscious and makes me not want to go back to my unhealthy lifestyle.

7. Cleaning house - staying busy and helping my wife clean house gives me something to do other than sit around and watch tv and want to smoke. 

8. Telling my family and friends - having support and people cheering me on really helps during the more difficult times of wanting to smoke.

9. Having an app - keeping track of how long Iâ€™ve been quit, and goals that I want to accomplish in it. Seeing savings, things I want to purchase, health benefits. All of that helps me stay on track. 

10. Drinking plenty of water - on past quits I have drank soda to handle cravings. Using water helps a ton more. I guess just staying better hydrated helps me not want to smoke.

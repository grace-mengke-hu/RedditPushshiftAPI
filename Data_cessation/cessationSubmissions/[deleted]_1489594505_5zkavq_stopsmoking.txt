The Stench! The Horrific Stench!

A customer came into my work and REEKED from here to high heaven and back again of cigarettes... think: chain-smoked all winter indoors and outdoors and in a car while wearing the same coat 24/7... 

I'm well aware that my coat doesn't smell so fresh (I noticed it last night when I put it on to go out to shovel), but day-ummmm!  I doubt my sense of smell came back in 3 days??? 

Even when I smoked, I hated the smell of smoke unless I was actually smoking around others at the same time... this woman and her coat completely floored me! Unclean! Unclean!

And yes, I plan on washing my coat tomorrow...

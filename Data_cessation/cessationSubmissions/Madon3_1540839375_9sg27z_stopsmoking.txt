Request from a fellow ex smoker.

So I am 25 and I've been smoking for 4 years. I've been bedridden for a while recently due to an accident. smoked a lot.

Now I am out of breath for just a little walk and cough up. My body is weak. I can't go across 2 floors of stairs. I sweat amazingly. I've put on 15 kgs over my previous "normal" weight.

I've never been fat and I'm not used to feeling my stomach bulge when I sit.

I've tried weights in my home but I wheeze up.
need help. Please tell me what should I do.

I feel like a waste and need help changing that.

I want to lose weight at the same time need to increase my endurance so that I don't fall out of breath after a 500-meter walk.

I'm ready to be uncomfortable and can workout 2 times a day. I know I seem generic but I am in need and couldn't find a better place to ask for.

Also quitting smokes too. I am on my 4th day. pushing on till I can.

Also, my heart beats like a jackhammer even after a little workout. Thought to ask if anything is wrong with that.

Tried R/fitness but the post was banned. only place I thought was her. anyone had the same problems?

what did you do?

any workout suggestions and advice. please

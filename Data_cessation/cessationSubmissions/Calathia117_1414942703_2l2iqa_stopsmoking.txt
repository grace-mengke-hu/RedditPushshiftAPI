I broke down and got a packet :/

So after 6 months of no tobacco.. I had an emotional breakdown yesterday and bought a packet of cigs. I spenr an hour standing outside the store contemplating whether I should or not. I lost the battle with myself and went for it. All day today I've been saying to myself "Okay, I'm gonna stop this before it gets out of hand". Nope, I should toss the packet, but I can't. This is seriously worrying. I just finished having a smoke and I almost grabbed another one. Soon enough i will be chain smoking like the old days. Fucking hell.                                                                     EDIT: Thanks for the support guys. Pack is in the trash. The urges are there, but I'm not going down that path again. Feels good.

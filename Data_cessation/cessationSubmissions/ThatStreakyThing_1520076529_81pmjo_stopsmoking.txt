Only if you struggle with relapsing or just want to start, of course. It's easier this way on a neurochemical level. If you have Nicotine in your system, it gives you the effect of compulsive redosing, which is part of the Nictotine after effects or "hangover".

That way you can still get a good sleep while already waking up without nicotine in your system.

I'm quitting smoking today, for good.

I'm an excuse-driven guy and need even smallest ones to convince me in actually doing things. Accidentally left my lighter in a cafe today and decided it's time I quit for good. Tossed the remaining cigs in the trash can, too, to give myself some boost in determination. I'm not addicted easily to anything so hopefully I can do this with ease (don't crave or develop dependency in any substances, even alcohol). Regularly looking for places to puff, denying my girl that I smoke, disgusting sputum... all end today. Still keeping my pipe though (without any tobacco left) since it looks nice on the table.

Please wish me luck and a new smoke-free life :)

I have both the urge to quit and to keep going on cigs...

I have been smoking since October 2nd, 2009. I am a line cook, which is how I started in the first place, cause there's nothing better than a smoke after a kick-ass service. I live with my partner, who doesn't smoke. We have talked about me quitting a number of times. I went on an e-cig for about a year, and in January this year, I quite smoking. Two months later, I got a call from my folks with some family medical problems. And I went right back, one ciggy at a time. Now my partner won't talk to me about it. I feel that air of resentment coming from him. But I feel two different ways. I would like to quit. But also, knowing that he is throwing a tantrum over something that I am making the choice to do, I am digging my heels in and refusing to back down. Did anyone else go through these feelings? If so, any resolvement?

5 days tonight

Started smoking when I was 16 (I'm 25 now.)  Moved in with my heavy smoker boyfriend 2 years ago and the addiction really took off, ha.

About 6 months ago, my boyfriend, who was smoking a whole pack of rolling tobacco a day, quit.  Like, he bought a fancy nicotine vaporizer and that was that.  I quit with him- but I half-assed it.  I would have 1-3 smokes a day and spend the rest of the time going nuts, haha

Around this time I was at work and talking to a customer who was encouraging me to stop smoking.  It wasn't annoying, actually- he was really cool.  So we made a "pact" that I would stop smoking and he would lose 20 lbs. by 12/20 (the next time he'd be back in my place of business.)

I didn't take the pact seriously.  I started smoking again a week later and it was like I hadn't stopped.

However, on Thanksgiving I didn't smoke (my grandparents don't know!) and I just figured I'd stop.  I had one cigarette on Sunday during a moment of high stress, but other than that I've been good.  I feel much stronger about it this time.

Also, I've already been talking with the customer I made the pact with, and I'm ready to show him up!

It gets tough at night and when I'm driving to work... what has helped you guys in the initial quitting stage?

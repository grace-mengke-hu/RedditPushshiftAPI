Day one quitting smoking and a slightly gross question.

Hello reddit world! This is my first post as a member (OH has been convincing me to come here for months.) 

I have been smoking for almost 7 years now and today is the day I have had diarised for months to quit. I have one small problem. Every morning religiously, I have my breakfast, have a fag, and this in turn encourages me to go for a poo. I attempted quitting last year and without my morning fag, I struggled to go for the poo. Sometimes for several days on the trot I would not be able to go once, then comes in the feelings of being bloated, gross, etc. It was one of the reasons I fell off the wagon.

Now this is attempt 2 and I am 100% committed to succeeding this time. I would just like to know if any of you who have quit have had similar problems, and if so can you please give me tips or advice on how you managed it? I have a relatively healthy diet and workout 5 days a week, so I do not think this is the issue. I fear it may be more of a psychological dependence on the tobacco to help me go. 

Thank you, and sorry that my first ever post is talking about poo! :)

Here we go again.

I initially quit in February and made it up until July without smoking. However, as soon as I was away on holiday I decided it would be fine for me to smoke while I was away and I'd quit the day I got home. This didn't work out though and I slowly started smoking again, at first on nights out then at work and now I've been smoking full time again for a couple of weeks. I know I can do it because I lasted so long before I just hope that this is it!

Anybody else feel no real changes?

Been quit for just over a month now and I don't feel any real changes other than cravings are less.  Smell, energy levels, taste that everybody talks about is the same as it was prior to the quit.  Not saying that I am trying to excuse myself back into smoking but I don't get the whole "OMG I can smell shit again!".

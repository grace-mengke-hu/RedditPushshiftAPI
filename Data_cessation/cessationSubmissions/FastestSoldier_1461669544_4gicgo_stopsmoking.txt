Almost three days tobacco free

This has been surprisingly easy this far with very little cravings. I'm worried that cravings and withdrawals will hit me like a truck at any moment now. Where are they?

I'm a serial quitter and the second day was always the worst for me. But this run has been painless in every way. The only thing I'm struggling with is sleep, but that's about it. Maybe quitting tobacco doesn't always have to be painful, because it sure as hell is not now. I just hope I don't get too many surprise withdrawals in the near future.

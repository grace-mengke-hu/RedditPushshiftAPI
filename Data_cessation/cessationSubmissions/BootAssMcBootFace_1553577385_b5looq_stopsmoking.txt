Does having a cigarette instantly bring you back to square 1?

I haven't smoked in like 2 years and gave up vaping 6 months ago. If I have a single cigarette at a party or something will I go back to having cravings all the time? I still get them probably once a day or so and it's manageable, but man I would kill to just have a cigarette or cigar on the weekends lol

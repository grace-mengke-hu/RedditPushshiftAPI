First week cigarette free, but can't say I'm being honest with myself.

I remember puffing my last cigarette exactly a week ago. Moments before the clock struck 12 and that was it. This has been my second attempt at quitting cold-turkey, the last time I relapsed in about 4 days. Here's my story..

I can't run for 2 minutes without running out of breathe. I can't climb on stairs and have to take an elevator every single time. I almost passed out from playing football 2 months ago from running out of breathe. I've been addicted on cigarettes for about 5-6 years, peaking in at about a packet/day of Marlboro Reds for 2 years. I have since then seen my health quickly deteriorate but never really cared much.

I live in Pakistan, where cigarettes are as cheap as a dollar a pack so the money was never really the matter here. 

To curb my cigarette cravings, I have extended my Sheesha intake to 2 hour sessions every day where-as I limited myself to One 1 hour session + a packet of cigarettes/day before quitting cigarettes for good.

I've been smoking Sheesha for as long as 7 years, ever since I was 13 years old but nearly not as much as the past 2 years. 

How do I go about restoring my lung capacity to its potential and seek out a proper treatment to live a healthy life? Any word from an ex-sheesha addict would be A1. All advice is welcome.

Fighting a craving atm

Having some cravings right now. I've come to accept a failure in my academics and also a shift in my career focus. Really want to smoke a cig before I shoot off an email.

Super unhappy. But I know smoking won't make me less sad or stressed right now.  

Ugh. Just me venting.

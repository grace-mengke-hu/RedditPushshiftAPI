Day 1

First day of the rest of my life. This is my first post on Reddit, thought it would be easier if I told people online and in real life.

Fuck cigarettes!

I just threw away three packs of cigarettes, my pipes and all other smoking related accessories.
Also ordered Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking and The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment.

Have a good day ya'll! :)

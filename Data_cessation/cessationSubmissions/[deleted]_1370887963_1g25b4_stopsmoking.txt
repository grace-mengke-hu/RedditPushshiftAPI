3 days down.

I know a lot of you are afainst the electronic cigarettes, but I use mine just enough to take that edge off so I don't fly off the deep end. A cold has kind of made its way into my immune system, but all in all I am still going strong and focused on the goal. I love my family too much to go back to cigarettes. Thank you all for your support.

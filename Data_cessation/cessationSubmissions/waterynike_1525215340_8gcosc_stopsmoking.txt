When do emotions calm down? Any tips?

I feel like death today. About a week in and an nauseous, have no energy,muscles hurt etc. I decided to distract myself and got in Reddit and read a AskReddit about what movies make you cry...and have been crying for 45 minutes lol. Any tricks or tips? I used on lozenge, did deep breaths, got gum for some sugar and none is helping these symptoms.

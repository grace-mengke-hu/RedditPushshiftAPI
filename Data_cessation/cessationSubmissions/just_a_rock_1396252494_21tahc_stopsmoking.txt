582 Days...This too can be you.

I honestly forgot that I was even subscribed to this subreddit. I clicked on it only to see my flair, 582 days....wow! That to me is incredible. An avid pack a day smoker for over 8 years to where I'm at now seemed impossible the first few days...months. The cravings, headaches, depression, lack of sleep, habitual stress of not having a cigarette...it all goes away. If you have any doubt in yourself at all, just please hang in there. I want all of you to be able to feel how I feel today, 582 days in.

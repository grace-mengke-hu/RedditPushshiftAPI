Loop that I can't break

I am a smokers for 9 years now, starting when i was 16 and now i am 24. I kept relapsing on day 4. I can't get a week without relapsing. I have tried since early this year. My parents , brothers and my friends were a smokers. I live with my brother was also a smoker, he was very supportive when i told him  wanted to quit, he stop smoking inside the house and when im at the car with him. The problem was i stuck in a loop where i just cant get past a week. I'm tired of relapsing, in knew i will regret taking that puff but i still taking it though.

 I dont know what to do now. This is the first time i posted here, seeing everyone achieved their goals really inspired me. I really need advices or tips from anyone. Sorry for my english, it is not my first language. I really need your guys help on this

Please help, 33, Smoker for 19 years

Please help

I am 33, have been a smoker for 19 years.

In two days it's my 33rd birthday. I have smoked since I was 14. I smoke Marlboro 100s, full strength. 

I am overweight and smoke 10 to 15 cigs a day. When I come home, I walk up the sidewalk, up 5 stairs, into my building and then up 3 flights of stairs. When I get to the top I am winded and can barley breathe. I call this seizing out.

I have decided that come my birthday, I am done. I already feel problems breathing and have yellowed teeth from smoking. My problem is I have no support system at all outside of my wife, who also plans to quit. I don't know what to expect once I begin. I really could use some help from the community, with any tips or inspirations you may have.

Not being able to walk up the stairs and carry groceries or anything, without feeling like I'm going to die is a horrible feeling. I recently got married and want to live a long life with my wife. At 28, my first wife died from lung cancer (mesothelioma, not from smoking) and I don't want to follow the same path, because I am happy again. 

So please help guys. I've never wanted to quit, always brushed it off, but am at a major crossroads. I can't even imagine being able to breathe normally without struggling.

My journey begins very soon. I'll be sure and update frequently.

Thanks :)

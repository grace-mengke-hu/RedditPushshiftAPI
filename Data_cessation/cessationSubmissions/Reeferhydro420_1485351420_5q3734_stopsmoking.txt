Quit zits?

I'm 22 hours in since my last slip up. I was just wondering, are quit zits real? And how bad can it get ? I've heard stories of smokers that got permanent severe acne after they've quit, most likely because the cigarettes were covering up underlying medical problems or left them with hormonal imbalance, IBS? Are these stories true? Or are they just trolls on Reddit trying to deter ppl from quitting smoking?

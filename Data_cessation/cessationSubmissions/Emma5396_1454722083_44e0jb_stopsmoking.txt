3 Weeks and feeling the benefits :)

Hi all - Well i can honestly say i didnt think that i would be able to manage 2 days let alone 3 weeks.
Well after my first 10 days of detox of energy drinks and large amounts of nicotine im feeling much better.
Im feeling the benefits of smelling and tasting all these foods and not thinking they are bland.
The most imprtant thing about this quit is that its my last and i am a non smoker now.  I do miss it a bit but there is something about this quit that i feel good about.
I want to see my kids grow up and get married and working in a hospital and watching people struggle for air at very young ages this does make you feel like there is more to life than smoking.

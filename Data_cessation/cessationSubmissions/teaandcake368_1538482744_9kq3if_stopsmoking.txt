Public admittance of my last cigarette

I started smoking 2 years ago at age 22 through both poor self esteem and therefore a lack of self worth but also for social reasons.  After reading Alan Carr's book, my excuses for smoking have been destroyed.

It really is disgusting and I'm fed up of smelling bad, bad skin, stained fingers, stained teeth and quite frankly not being able to walk fast without becoming breathless.

Here's to health and self acceptance. A huge thank you to this sub for its support xxx

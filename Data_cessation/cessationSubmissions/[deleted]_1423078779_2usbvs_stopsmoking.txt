Perhaps this is the wrong place but....

I have quit smoking 4 years ago almost overnight. I had just decided one day that I was done. I did however continue to smoke marijuana. 

I want to quit and today is day one, but I've not gone without smoking in almost 13 years except for when I was in the military. I don't think I can stop, today is day 1 and I want out. 

I do not understand how I was able to drop cigarettes but can't seem to kick this habit. :(

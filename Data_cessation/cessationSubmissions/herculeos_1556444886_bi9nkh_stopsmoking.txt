1 week! - collateral damage &amp; collateral growth

Right now I have quit for exactly 7 days, very happy that I made it this far, and I am confident that I will never smoke again - which is a good thing, because I avoid a lot of problems and can move on to better and more meaningful challenges than this struggle against addiction.

Every day of my journey I am reflecting for a moment about what I experience as I am quitting smoking, and what it means to my life to do so, with the goal of learning about myself (I eventually want to start journaling, but this is a good start) and in the hopes of (perhaps) inspiring some of you and discussing some ideas that are floating around in my head.

Today I wish to write about smoking indirectly does to you and your environment (collateral damage) and what quitting smoking allows you to do (collateral growth). I got this idea from the Jocko Podcast, episode 174, which was a great listen, and I recommend this podcast if you'd like to grow as a person, and who likes a direct, practical and no-nonsense style treatment about the topic of personal development, as opposed to the often abstract, 'soft' or merely philosophical style that you see a lot, and though such a style can have it's value, I don't like it if it's detached from reality.

Anyways, let's go to the topic at hand.

**Collateral Damage**

Smoking causes more damage than you'd realize. The first problem with smoking that comes to mind is the direct damage that you cause to your lungs, on the short term the coughing and shortness of breath that you experience, and on te the possibility of developing all sorts of nasty diseases one day.

However, there is also the damage that you cause to the health of the people around you. Your friends, family, and strangers on the street or in the bar that inhale your smoke. The damage may be very slight or quite severe, depending on how much you smoke around people, but no matter what, it doesn't feel fair to me, especially if those people have no choice to avoid inhaling your second hand smoke.

But what I find most interesting, and this is what the podcast was hinting about (concerning other examples), was that if you smoke, you tend to value your health less in general - because you already don't feel like your living healthily, why does it matter if I get pizza every day? You also train your brain to behave like an addict, further enhancing the poor lifestyle choices. I certainly did this, which led to me becoming 106 kg.

Not only that, but I became miserable. I lost respect for myself, and my addict behavior was partly to blame for that (there were other things going on at the time). When I quit, a lot of negativity about myself and my future disappeared, allowing myself to grow again.

**Collateral Growth**

In addition to avoiding a lot of damage, you also allow yourself to grow further when you quit smoking. Every time I quit, I got a lot of self-confidence that I could overcome my weaknesses and this led to a lot of growth as a person. I organized parts of my life, quit other bad habits and started new routines. I also learned a lot about myself and what I valued. Being healthy and free are very important for me, and so not being addicted to something that destroys me was a great step, and I continued to pursue these values by starting to do rock climbing and triathlon. I still do that right now, and now that I quit for good I am once again.

Another good thing is not only that I motivate and energize myself to grow further, I also do this to the people around me, because I am convinced that when one person gets rids of his shackles that once bound him and becomes free, that this freedom is contagious. Of course, there will be jealous people, but many people will be happy for you and try to emulate you. I am not a person to tell people what to do, but I know that people need role models (I do too) and so you can become one by going through a transformation and becoming a living example of the positive qualities that you value.

This time I am experiencing this growth again. I feel like I can take on any challenge and my life feels more meaningful again. I started exercising more (and enjoying it a lot), I am organizing and beautifying my home, I am improving my relationships with family and friends, I am reading almost every day, practicing meditation and I could go on and on. Don't get me wrong, I am very patient with myself, I don't have to grow quickly, but it just happens. Smoking was a source of shame and guilt, and it kept me down, and now that it's out of the way, a lot of potential is unlocked. I am very grateful that I get this opportunity, and for the growth I experience every day.

I hope there's a lot of good for you in store as well. Keep on going, the troubles that you may experience as you are quitting are nothing compared to the benefits that you will see, so even if it takes you years and many attempts, it's a great investment, so don't give up!

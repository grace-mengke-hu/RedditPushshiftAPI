My true cost of smoking for a year

Today is my 1 year smoke-free anniversary (yay!). I posted this in /r/PersonalFinanceCanada and thought I'd repost it here because it is relevant. Like the nerd I am, I thought I'd run the numbers to quantify how much smoking would have cost me this year.

| Item             | 7 Days    | 1 Year      | Avg. Unit Cost |  Total | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

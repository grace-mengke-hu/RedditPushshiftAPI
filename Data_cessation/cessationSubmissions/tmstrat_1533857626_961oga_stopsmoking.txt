Day two mixed in with allergic reactions.

It is my second day sans cigs and man I got a whammy of an allergic reaction in my eyes.  I look like Rocky, wanted a cig but realized after getting through the first day I should able to pull through this speed bump!  After 20 years of smoking I owe this to my future!

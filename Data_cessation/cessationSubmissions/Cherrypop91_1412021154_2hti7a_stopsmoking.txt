New here

Hi guys! I am new here. So glad I found this sub! I smoked for 4 years and was up to almost 2 packs a day. It finally came to a point where I was just done with it. Tired of it taking a toll on my health, my marriage, smelling good and my LIFE! 

I haven't smoked a cigarette in 6 DAYS and believe it or not I feel absolutely amazing! It was so hard the first few days but I can't believe I made it this far. I did cheat a little bit and switched to a vape pen. I had a backup pack in case I felt like it was too much but I ripped them in half and threw them away the second day. Once I got past the 24 hour mark I knew I could never pick one up again! 

I am so proud of myself!

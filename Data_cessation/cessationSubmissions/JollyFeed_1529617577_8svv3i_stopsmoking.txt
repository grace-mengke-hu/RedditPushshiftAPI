Three Weeks Smoke-free

I made it through my 2nd round of the icky threes. I should be happy about my achievement, but I'm pretty sick. I've been sick the past couple of days with congestion, inner ear infection, and an achy jaw. I've been pretty ho-hum about quitting the past few days because of not feeling well. It's been a rougher past couple of days than my initial first days.

 I don't want to smoke at all. I just want to not be sick anymore... and some chocolate pudding pie. But mostly, not to be sick.

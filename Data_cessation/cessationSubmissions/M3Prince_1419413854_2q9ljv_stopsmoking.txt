Warning on medications. Wellbutrin.

Ok people, imwas taking wellbutrin but it was making me feel sick and dizzy so i stopped six days ago.  A few days ago i started getting really anxious.  Yesterday i woke up and was yelling at wife uncontrollably.  

A friend said i was a moron that should have tapered off wellbutrin.  Had to go to doctor and he gave me prescription for xanax.   Good news is im not n jail and still havent smoked.  Bad news is xanax is some cool as shit.

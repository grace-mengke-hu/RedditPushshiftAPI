4th time quitting

 I'm on my 4th time quitting. That sounds stupid but it is my smoking story.

Quit cold turkey once for 3 years. Got all drunk one night and smokes some cigarettes. I started up again like I never stopped. 

2nd time I quit for 9-10 months. I used chantix. It was pretty easy to quit that time. Quit in less than two weeks on the pills. That time I got cocky and tried to prove I could smoke one or two to get the wife to believe it wasn't that bad. Yeah. That was pretty dumb.

3rd time, I read Allan carrs book and quit in about a month or so. I read the book and it really  helped. I quit for over 3 years that time. Then, last summer I made the mistake of smoking at a few concerts, then on a camping trip. I started up again. Another dumb ass mistake.


So here I am today. Starting my 4th time of quitting. I have been taking Chantix for 7 days.
I have not smoked a cigarette since roughly 9pm sun 7/9/17..

When I get through quitting this time, I am never touching another cigarette. Not even one. Such a waste of money, time, health and life.


Good luck to everyone out there trying to quit. Do not make the same mistakes I did. Not even 1.

And never, quit quitting!

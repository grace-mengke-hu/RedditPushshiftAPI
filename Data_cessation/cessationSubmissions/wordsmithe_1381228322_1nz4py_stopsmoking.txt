Why Wanting to Quit Has Been More Important Than Needing to Quit

It's been 2 weeks on my journey towards a smoke-free life and I have noticed a lot of differences between my current and past quits.


Before my current quit, quitting was something I absolutely had to do.  We all know smoking will kill us and that all we need to do is stop. So every time I quit, I was prepared for the headaches and physical ailments that came from nicotine withdrawals.


But I failed. Every single time.


It wasn't until I understood what it meant to WANTING to live smoke-free versus NEEDING it. We all need to be healthy. We all want to be fit, avoid going to the doctor, and live as long as we possibly can.  But even after I got past the physical withdrawals, I would smoke out of boredom or habit.


"It's alright if I smoke. The withdrawals were nothing. I can get through it."


It's not the physical addiction. It really is the, to quote Allen Carr, the mental addiction. I wanted to smoke after a drink, after a long day at work, after sex, after finishing a long project. Not because I was suffering the cruelty of my nicotine addiction, but because I believed those tasks were incomplete until I lit one up. 


I'm still struggling to get through the mental part of my addiction, but knowing why I want to smoke has been helpful. I've been smoking a pack a day for 10 years and gone through a considerable amount of 'quits'. It feels very real this time around. 


Thank you guys for being supportive and for providing a medium for me to get my thoughts and rants in order. I am grateful for all the help you have provided me for the past couple weeks and am thankful for the times you will help me in the future. 


Let's keep grinding through this until we can all get to that smiley star badge.

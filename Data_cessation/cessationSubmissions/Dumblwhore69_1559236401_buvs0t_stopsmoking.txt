Quit buddies?

The further I get into the process of quitting, the more I realize how much support is needed to stay strong. The problem is, almost no one in my real life knows I ever smoked. 
I don’t really want to continue to spam this sub despite how great it is for support, so would anyone want to message about how it’s going every now and again?

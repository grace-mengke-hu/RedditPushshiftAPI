Need. To. Quit.

Hey.

I started two years ago at the age of 36. Seems like an odd time to start.  I stopped running (which I once loved), gained 50 pounds,  and "made" myself go from an occasional cigar smoker to a daily cigarette smoker. Because I was depressed I consciously wanted to damage my body because I stopped caring. It really made no sense and was [obviously] very poor rationale. I was in a dark place at the time.

About six months into the daily habit I talked to my wife about it. She was sad for me that I felt so terrible. She obviously didn't want me to smoke but she was more concerned about the overall state of my mental health. It broke her heart to see me so down. Thankfully we worked together to get me out of the hole and it proved to be merely a temporary slump.
Yet although I was able to climb out of the depression, I didn't give up the smokes. I did it long enough to get my brain hooked on 'em.

Presently, I want the benefits of not smoking but I don't seem to go more than three or four days every time I "quit" and then I'm back at it hot and heavy for a few weeks.

I was really encouraged by Allen Carr's Easy Way book. In fact, I've read it twice. I mostly agree with his method and his insight. And yet . . . I won't stop.


Smoking has caused the following issues for me:

*I'm much more lethargic than before I started;
*Can't get re-started with running/exercise/better health;
*I eat lots of junk food because a) I can't taste quality food as well and b) I constantly feel lethargic;
*My usually amazing sex life with my lovely wife of 17 years has slowed down, mainly because I have less energy, can't "perform" as well, and actually run out of breath sometimes;
*My clothes, skin, and truck smell like nasty, stale, burnt ass.

I know it's only been two years but I think I notice the effects so dramatically because I spent most of my life not smoking and moderately healthy.

And yet . . . I haven't quit yet. WHY DO I KEEP COMING BACK TO THESE NASTY LITTLE FUCKERS?!?!?!?!

Anyway, if you've read this, thank you. I'm hoping to hang around this sub to give myself a little more of a nudge to get healthy again. I need to ditch these damn things once and for all.

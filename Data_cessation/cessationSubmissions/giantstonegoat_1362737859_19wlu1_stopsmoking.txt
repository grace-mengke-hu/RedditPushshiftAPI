Just wanted to share a minor victory.

Yesterday I did two things which have been known to ruin quit attempts. First I had a job interview, then I went drinking. AND I DIDN'T SMOKE BEFORE, AFTER OR DURING EITHER! I've never managed to do that before so I think that this time I may have finally quit forever!

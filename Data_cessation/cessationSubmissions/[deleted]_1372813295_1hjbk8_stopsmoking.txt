Back smoking, feeling like shit.

So I started smoking 6 years ago, and I just started smoking again after a 3 month break. 

I need help. 
 
I feel like shit because I'm smoking again, and so when I feel like shit I reach for a cigarette. 

What do you guys do when you're feeling down and the first thing you want is a cigarette?

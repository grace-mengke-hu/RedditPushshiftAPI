First Day, kinda bombed

Today is my quit day. My husband is quitting too- we both smoke the same kind of cigarettes, and anytime only one of us has tried to quit in the past without the other, we inevitably caved. So I'm glad we're in this together this time. 

Anyway, I found some cigs in the house that I forgot I had so of course I smoked them. The reason I'm saying I "kinda" bombed instead of totally bombing it is that a.) I still smoked way, way less than I would have on a normal day so that's good, and b.) no new cigarettes were purchased. 

So tomorrow is a new day and there won't be any in the house this time, and I'm stocked up on mints. Hopefully it will go better than today!

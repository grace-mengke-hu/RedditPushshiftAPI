Day 10 and everything annoys me

I quit smoking 10 days ago. Me and my roommates agreed we would all quit. All of them have starting smoking again. None of them lasted more than a day. 

So I'm super annoyed and they keep picking fights because I'm super bitchy all the time. When does the bitchiness fade or is this a permanent side effect of quitting!?

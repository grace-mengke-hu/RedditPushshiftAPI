New girlfriend is a smoker - what to do?

She revealed she was a smoker after the first few dates.  I though it'd be no big deal, but now I'm starting to doubt my decision.  My clothes smell like smoke, she smokes right before we get in bed (massive turn-off), and I taste cigarette when I kiss her.  She's made some half-hearted attempts to quit, but I can tell she's not ready.

Has anyone else made this situation work?  I find myself more and more tempted to smoke now, which I thought was behind me.  I'm thinking of breaking up because of it, but I feel like I'm being petty.

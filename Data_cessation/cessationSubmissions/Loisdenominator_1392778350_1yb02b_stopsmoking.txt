How did you find this sub?

In honour of my 8 month anniversary and my real life cake day, how did you find your way to /r/stopsmoking?

Me first: I saw the sub referenced in a comment in some other sub thread and it was like stars aligned. I mean, most smokers want to quit. I lurked for a few months. Picked up Allen Carr. Read. Posted. Bitched. Moaned. Got involved. Fast forward 8 months and here I am. It still blows my mind and makes me so proud of myself, especially so on a birthday.

And you, come here often? I mean, how did you end up at /r/stopsmoking?

Lozenges. Anyone recommend them?

I'm in the verge of trying to stop smoking.....again. I've never been successful except back in 97 when I was forced to quit at boot camp. First thing I stupidly did when I got out was grab a pack. Every time I try now I try cold and the urge is so strong, I'm in my car before I realize it, my body already starting to feel better knowing I'm on my way to get cigs. 
I'd like to try lozenges but not sure how well they work. Any experiences?

You CAN do it (1,000 days)

Just wanted to drop by and let everyone know: You CAN do this. I smoked 1 to 1.5 packs a day for 12 years and I tried to quit more times than I could count, but I was never successful. Patches, gum, medicine, etc... I always ended up going back, because I believed I enjoyed it, I believed I liked the taste, and most of all I believed it helped reduce stress.

What I discovered when I got 30-40 days into my final, successful quit attempt? Smoking was taking my money, making me smell, taking my health, AND the constant withdrawal WAS CAUSING the stress.

Today I can run... I can run so fucking fast and far. Just last week I went for a 23 mile run. I've completed a trail marathon. I've gone from 12 minute miles when I quit smoking to a 6:15 mile. I fucking destroy running and it gives me so much pleasure. If I would have never quit smoking I never would have gained this confidence and this love of running.

You CAN do this.

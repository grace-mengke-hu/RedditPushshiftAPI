My best friends are smokers i just stopped 24 hours ago, what should I do?

Hello folks, thanks to this subreddit It's been 24 hours since i've stopped, you can never believe the impact and power of seeing people celebrating a year or two without poison, and even when i don't open it and just the title shows it gets logged to my subconcious, so yeah this subreddit is AMAZING you all are. 

But today i really want your help in dealing with best friends who are smokers, I'm no way young, i'm 31 years old and my best friends are ALL smokers! how did you deal with such situations when you were quitting? any tips? I don't want to be an asshole to them and at the same time I don't want their choices to affect my life.

Thank you. 

Update: 50 hours with no cigs, 2 days down :D thank you guys for the comments and responses you are all awesome.

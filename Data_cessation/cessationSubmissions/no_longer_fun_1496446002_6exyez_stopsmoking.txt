Haven't smoked since I gave up a month ago yet can't bring myself to throw my cigs away - anyone else with weird quirks/superstitions?

It's been a month since I quit and it's been a lot easier than I thought it would be, which I'm both surprised with and grateful for. I definitely credit Champix with this but it wouldn't have meant much if I'd still wanted to smoke. I have the odd craving here and there but I truly believe I am permanently smoke free! I've also been tapering off the Champix and don't feel different without them; I've been taking 1 per 24 hours instead of 2 for the last couple of weeks and I occasionally forget completely but it's been fine.

... However, I have a box of cigs with maybe 8 left in them. I can't seem to let them go. Not having cigarettes was a major source of worry for me and I'd drive late at night to places far away, or take long walks to the nearest shop on a night out, if I ran out of cigs. I think it's a comfort thing - I leave the box at home when I go out and I hide them out of view when indoors, but there's this odd security that comes with knowing they are there.

Does anyone else have any odd quitting superstitions or habits? I think I'll be able to overcome this one eventually and will give the pack to either one of my friends or someone in the street, but even if I don't I think it would make for a mildly funny story that I keep a box of ancient cigarettes 30 years after my last puff.

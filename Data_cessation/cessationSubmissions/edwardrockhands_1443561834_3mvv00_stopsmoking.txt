Quitting now!

Just smoked my last cigarette. I'm going to stop taking my ADD meds for at least the first three days because the craving i get when i'm on them are extreme to say the least. Wish me luck!
Also my worst trigger is at work, i have a very tedious desk job with no real deadlines so i often smoke to pass the time. Any advice on what to do when i need to leave my desk?

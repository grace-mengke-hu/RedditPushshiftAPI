What do I do with my hands now?

I quit smoking a few days ago (I know, not much) but the most noticeable difference so far is I feel like I have all of this restless energy specifically in my hands. I donâ€™t want to chew my nails (another bad habit that took me way too long to break) but I need to do something. Any advice?

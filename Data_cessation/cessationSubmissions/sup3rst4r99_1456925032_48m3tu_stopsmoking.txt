6th day off the nic - Feeling blue!

So as the topic says i'm 6 days off the poison.
I've quit once before 2,5 years ago after a habit of smoking for 15 years. I stupidly began using nicotine ~7 months ago again and now it's EVEN TOUGHER THAN LAST TIME, believe it or not.
6 days in and I'm struggling to cope with some sort of depression. I was depressed/feeling down before I quit too because I was pissed at myself for allowing me to start smoking again and then noticing that i couldn't get off them easily. I was trapped - got depressed - got anxiety from smoking - had to relieve the anxiety with smoking - a vicious wheel indeed.

So back to now, 6 days in, feeling down (but not much anxiety for some reason). Just a general feeling blue/depressed feeling almost all the time. I don't remember it from last time, however it's possible I had the same feelings last time too.
Is this familiar with anyone? Depressed the first few weeks? When did it start to lift? I KNOW that nicotine in some form would elevate my spirit right now - but at the same time give me anxiety. Isn't life wonderful?

I also started "living healthy" this last week, and I may have overdone it by using too much supplements, like magnesium, fish oil, d3, very strong probiotics + some multivitamin crap. This has given me nausea which is not very nice to have on top of everything else. So no more supplements for a few days. Except maybe magnesium.

Some input would be nice - Depression wise I mean.

Ciao!

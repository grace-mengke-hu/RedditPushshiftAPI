Reset that shit.

Well, I honestly am not too discouraged. I went to Vegas for my bachelor party and I smoked a ton of ciggs, while drinking and partying all weekend with all my old friends, and you know what I fucking loved it, for 2 reasons. One, because I smoked ;) and 2) because my last cig was right before I got on the plane back to Boston at 10:30ish Vegas time and I have not had one, or really thought about one since. I made it 88 days before I smoked, I don't see any reason I can't do it again and go even longer. Just because I slipped up for a few days doesn't mean I fucked up for life. Reset that shit and let's do it again!

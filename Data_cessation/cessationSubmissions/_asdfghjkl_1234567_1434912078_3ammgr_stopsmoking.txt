I came here just to check my flair.. over two weeks!

Because it's nice to tell someone... Apparently I'm at 15 days. I'm shocked as shit.

To update on my vape situation, the local store only had my favorite flavor in 6mg, so that's what I have. I don't use it much, but it's there for entertainment and it's better than the 18mg bottle I threw out.

How am I doing? I guess pretty good. I've had a few moments where I think "I'm going to go buy a pack", then I start to really think about WHY I want to buy a pack. What will that one little stick do? Will it really calm me down? No, it'll make me sad, upset, and angry that I used it. I try to imagine what I'll smell like and what it will actually taste like. Then in 2 minutes, I'm fine. 

Seriously, think about the smell. Pick up an ashtray and remember how fucking BAD that smells. Why do you want that in you? I spend so much time smelling all my clothes, bed, car and realizing how great everything smells WITHOUT the smoke. 

So to those who are also working on this or whatever, it's really not THAT hard, once your mind is in the right spot. I wanted to quit and I did. It would not have worked last year. 

Also, my mile run time has gone down about a minute. That's cool too.

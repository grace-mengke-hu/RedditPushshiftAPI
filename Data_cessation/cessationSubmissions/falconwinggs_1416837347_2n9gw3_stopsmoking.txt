4 and half days in, at the crossroads, whether to go for NRT or not

Should I go for NRT. I've been a smoker for 3 years, moderate (6-8 cigs aday) for the 1st and 3rd year, and heavy (15-17) for the 2nd year. 
2nd serious attempt to quit, reached 11 days the last time and have notoriously weak will power. Do you think NRT will be useful for me?

Thanks guys 🙏🏻

Even though I posted earlier today that I’d fallen off the wagon a bit lately, I wanted to post about a time shortly before that wherein you all prevented me from smoking.
I went to get a tattoo worked on last month (when I still hadn’t been smoking for like 2 months) and I was sitting for 5 hours. There wasn’t much for me to do, so I just scrolled through reddit the entire time I was getting tattooed. Halfway through the tattoo, I had it firm in my mind that I was going to buy a pack afterwards. It wasn’t even a question, I just decided after 5 hours of sitting/pain, I was gonna smoke.
I didn’t even seek out this subreddit, but as I scrolled, I kept running into posts from r/stopsmoking and those posts basically talked me out of buying a pack, and I didn’t smoke that day.
I’m going to be faithful about checking this every morning before letting those cravings creep in again.  If I’d checked in with this more frequently, i believe i never would’ve eventually started smoking again. You’re all awesome!

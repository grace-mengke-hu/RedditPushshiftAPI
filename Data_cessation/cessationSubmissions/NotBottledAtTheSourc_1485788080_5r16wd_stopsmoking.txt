How do I start...?

Hey, don't know if I should be on here but I tried quitting about four times now, I smoke both marijuana and cigarettes, figured I would save around 400-500 a month if I could quit both. Even though I know how much money I would save, as soon as I run out of a pack I usually run right down to the nearest store and get another one.

 I tried patches, didn't work. I tried vaping, hate it. I just wanted to know if there were any other tips someone might have for me. I play games , mostly multiplayer and I tell myself that I can use games as a way to get my mind off of them, but I am quite competitive and when I lose a match I just want to spark another one up...  Maybe I just can't do it.

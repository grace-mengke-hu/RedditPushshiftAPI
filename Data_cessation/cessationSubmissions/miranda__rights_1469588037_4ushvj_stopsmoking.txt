When I wake up tomorrow (Wednesday, July 27th) I'm going to quit nicotine altogether.

Instead of cigarettes, I've been smoking disposable e-cigs. Tomorrow starts Day One of no nicotine. Any tips, prayers, and wishes of luck are greatly appreciated. I started smoking at 13, and I'm almost 22 now (so I've been smoking for 9 years), so this might be a huge mountain to climb, but I'll do it. I WILL do it.

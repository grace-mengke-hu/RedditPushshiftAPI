Advice for dealing with the quitting cough?

I have tried quitting 3 times and, each time, I go about 2 or 3 weeks. Usually around day 3 or 4, I get a bad cough. It gets progressively worse over week 2 and 3. At week 3, I usually cave and have one to help with the cough and, soon enough, I am back on the butts. 

Is there any way to bypass or lessen the cough?

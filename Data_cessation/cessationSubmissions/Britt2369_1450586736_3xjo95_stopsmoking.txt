First drinking experience since quitting

Tonight was my work Christmas party. I don't ever go out partying or anything like that anymore, so I don't typically drink much. I decided since it was my night out away from the little one for a bit I would have a couple drinks. I was pretty nervous about the smoking thing and asked my coworkers to absolutely refuse me if I asked for a cigarette. Luckily they didn't need to because I never asked for one!!! Smoking never even crossed my mind. I only had a couple of  drinks and did not get drunk, but usually just one drink was enough for me to smoke 2-4 cigarettes with it. I feel pretty good this evening after getting through what I thought would be really difficult with ease! 
Just so pleased with myself I had to share!! Haha.

Trying to quit again.

I went a good 7 days smoke free and I was feeling great after the 3rd day. But I relapsed after a friend of mine (who is a smoker) had me triggered to smoke another one. I went another 2 days smoking. But I found that drinking plenty of water and moderate exercise has helped me in the past. What are some other tips and techniques that has helped y'all from smoking?

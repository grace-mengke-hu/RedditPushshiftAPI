9 days smoke free!

Made it 9 days after smoking 10 a day for 15 years. Doing well so far, the cravings have diminished significantly but I had quite an unpleasant dream this morning. I woke up at 7:30 which is fairly normal for me but as it's a Saturday I thought oh to hell with it I'm going back to sleep for a bit. Hour and a half later I suddenly woke up in a blind panic after dreaming I had gotten out of bed, went and had my morning coffee and somehow had a lit cigarette in my hand before actually waking up! I don't count this as a negative however, I think it's just part of my mind coming to terms with the absence of something that has been part of my daily life for nearly half of my life.

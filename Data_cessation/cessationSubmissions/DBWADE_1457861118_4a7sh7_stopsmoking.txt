Advice on quitting symptoms

Hey r/stopsmoking, first sorry for any errors I'm on my mobile. I am finally to quit smoking for good, I've had some success in the past, but I'll cave and smoke one with a friend and start all over again. I have an addictive personality which can cause problems... Anyway I come to you guys for advice, the biggest problem I have is when I'm quitting I catch myself hitting my lip, or my fingers. As some sort or idle habit or replacement for the cigarette? Do you guys have any advice for me to stop myself from doing this? Any help is appreciated and thanks in advance.

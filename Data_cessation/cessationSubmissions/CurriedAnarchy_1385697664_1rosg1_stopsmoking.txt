Day 1....

Well, I smoked my last cig about seven hours ago. I've been smoking about half a pack a day for around six months. I'm fairly confident in my ability to quit. I quit smoking weed a few months ago after some fairly heavy use over the summer. After I ended my weed use I started smoking cigs much more consistently. However, I'm just tired of the effects they have on me (the dependency, the smoker's cough, shortness of breath etc...). So I have quit. I'm really excited to be off of them. But I feel like shit right now. Really bad headache and such. But I got rid of the rest of my pack earlier today and I promised myself to never buy another one. So no turning back. This should be interesting.

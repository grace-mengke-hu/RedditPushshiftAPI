"Whether you smoke or not, the craving to smoke will go away. The craving will leave faster and longer if you don't smoke."

I remember a friend of mine who quit smoking a long time ago.  She used to always say, "Whether you smoke or not, the craving to smoke will go away.  The craving will leave faster and longer if you don't smoke."  I'm reading and posting in this sub so I don't smoke tonight.  It's so weird - I don't want to smoke, yet I am having cravings to smoke!  I feel grateful that I planned for this ... anticipated some of the things I'd go through in withdrawing from the habit ... and am ready and willing to implement my 'battle plan' to maintain not smoking.  I am so grateful this sub is here!  In 2.5 hours, I will have six days!

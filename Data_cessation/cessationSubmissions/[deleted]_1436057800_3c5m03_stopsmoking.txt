Back for a second time.

I've been smoking for over 10 years. I'm back for a second time. Last time I was able to quit for over 5 months before I caved in... This time I am going to do it. I'm also quitting gaming and am trying out /r/nofap. 

How amazing my life would be in a years time if I could turn around and say to myself...

I am a non-smoker.
I am healthier.
I am richer.
I have a richer social life.
I have more confidence.
I feel better about myself.
I have less anxiety.
I conquered some hard demons.

That's my aim. I'll be posting here if I need to. You guys are awesome! :)

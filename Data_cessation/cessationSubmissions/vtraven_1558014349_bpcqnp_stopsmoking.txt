Quitting Is A Process

I'm fairly new to this sub still, but I've been active on r/stopdrinking for much of the last year. I had my last drink a little over a year ago now but it took half a dozen prior attempts and relapses to get there. I recently posted here about two weeks ago. I have relapsed since. As I'm writing this, I'm at about 48hrs without smoking. There is a chance that I will stumble and find myself smoking again. But I won't give up!

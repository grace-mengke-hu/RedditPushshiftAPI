The not nice "stop smoking" post. Don't read if you don't like tough love.

If you smoke, what's wrong with you? Seriously?

Do you know that if you still smoke right now you're the biggest idiot that ever lived. Seriously. There has *NEVER* in the history of smoking been a time where as much information is available 1) about the negatives of smoking 2) to help you stop smoking 3) rules against smoking.

People who died 20-30 years ago for smoking get a free pass, because the information wasn't as out there back then. But if you smoke, why? What is wrong with you? It *WILL* kill you. Realize that. 

Why do you bother going to work, or going to school, or having a family or friends, or working out, or saving money? Why do you do ANY of this if are a smoker? YOU WILL DIE FROM SMOKING.

I don't understand this. It's never been easier to be a non smoker. There is nothing keeping you as a smoker. 

My eyes were open over a year ago. Some would call me a non smoker, some would call me a former smoker, but I just call myself a non idiot.

Do yourself a favor. Stop smoking now.

Found a pack of cigarettes

Checking in on my friend's cat while she's on vacation. Pack of yellow American Spirits (my smoke of choice) on her kitchen counter.

I couldn't resist opening the pack to check whether it was empty. It was nearly full.

I could have taken one and smoked it, and nobody would ever have been the wiser.

But I didn't. Because even when there is no one else to disappoint, I don't want to disappoint myself.

Pretty proud of that moment.

Day 3 with the help of nicotine gum

After failing hundreds of times to go cold turkey over the past few years. I finally gotten to the third day without smoking. I know I’m still hooked on nicotine but it feels good not to have to inhale crap and to be able to fight the addiction and habit in two separate steps. 

Despite me typing this, today is the first time I’m alone at home and have no one to hold me accountable and it’s so tempting to just go out and buy cigs. 

If I can make it through today I know that I will be able to make it through tomorrow, my first workday since I quit.

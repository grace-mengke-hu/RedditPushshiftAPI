Always tempted.

I gave up smoking 18 months ago when I found out I was pregnant. I was smoking 20 a day before that for approx 10 years. Lately I am craving hard but I genuinely wouldn't smoke because I still breastfeed my baby and I want to live a long life now that she's around. 

I'm struggling a little inside though because I am starting a new job in a few weeks, all I can think about is smoking a cigarette on my lunch break. It will be my first time to leave her and I'm concerned that I won't be able to cope with leaving her and a new job (I am struggling with leaving her massively, I am having panic attacks and not sleeping the past two months just thinking about it). I need to focus in this job because for the first 9 weeks I will be in training  and if I don't pass I will be fired. I'm hoping someone will tell me to just smoke and that it'll be easy to give up again but I also don't want any encouragement. I just feel lost to be honest. I don't even know why I posted this, maybe I just need to rant.

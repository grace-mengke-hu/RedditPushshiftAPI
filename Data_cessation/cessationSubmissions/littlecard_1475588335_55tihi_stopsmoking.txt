48 hours and really struggling this am!

My longest quit so far and I keep arguing with myself over feeling proud and that I can do this verses I need a cig now! I did successfully drive past the 2 gas stations I normally go to on my way home form dropping my children off at school, but I am not feeling very strong at the moment.  

I have smoked since age 16 and am now 43 and I am trying to do cold turkey. I have read Allen Carr's books several time and  even paid for the webcast. It all makes perfect sense and I get excited about stopping  smoking, but then the panic sets in. I just can't seem to kick that desire to smoke and I believe that is what is making it so hard. I see a lot of references to Easyway on here and how it's a starting point, but curious to see who has found it to work as intended. Has it really been "easy" for anyone? I am not so much looking for the easy way out, as much as trying to figure out why this isn't  clicking for me!

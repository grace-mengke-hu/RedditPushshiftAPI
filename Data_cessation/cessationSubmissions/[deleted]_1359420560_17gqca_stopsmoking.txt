"The other day I was so desperate for a beer I snuck into the football stadium and ate the dirt under the bleachers."

[Quote from Homer Simpson.](http://youtu.be/SPzyAs2CpjU?t=12m20s)

It's been a day. This afternoon I went running and busied myself with work all day. Every time I got a craving I'd find some work, something to do, or drink coffee. Eventually around 5 I got desperate and went routing through the butt-bin at my house. I found half-a cigarette, covered in dirt and ash with a hole burned through the filter. I was about to light up and realized, "Jesus christ, this is fucking ridiculous!" I chucked it angrily back into the bin and went and took a nap. 

I had a dream that I dropped a cigarette behind my table. As soon as I woke up I went looking for this dream cigarette that didn't exist.

I then went back to that butt-bin and smoked that half of a disgusting cigarette.

I feel like a junkie...On a positive note I've only had a half of a cigarette today.

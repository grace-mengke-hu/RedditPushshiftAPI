My internal reward system is broken.

Hi, first time poster here on r/stopsmoking. I'm almost a veteran now of r/stopdrinking. Today is my 355th day without a single drop of alcohol.

And it's kind of the goal of my post. In the last year, to help me stop drinking, I've been rewarding myself with cigarettes, weed, coffee and alcohol free beers. Every day, it's been the same motto: You forgo the first drink. Play the tape foward. One day at  a time. All my energy has been on this and today I can say that I'm successful at not drinking. But I'm not cured of addictions... I still smome cigarettes and weed...

Annnd now I want to stop. I'm tired of being a slave of meaningless drugs. I'm pissed that I let my internal reward system get so fucked with all the damage I did to myself. I want to cure myself from addictions once and for all. I'm studying a lot right now. I'm trying to make my Wizard brain talk to my Lizard brain. I know everything we do is centered on a reward system. Mainly food and sex, but there's a lot more, especially in humans.

So here I am. I want to stop smoking for real. I wanted to stop two days ago, but my lizard brain won and I bought a pack. Maybe I can control it? Today I decided that I would allow myself to smoke, but only after work and only after training for at least 1 hour. If I don't train, I will not allow myself to smoke. This is the reward system that I'm talking about. I want to tame my subconscious. I'm hoping that once I'll be in shape the cravings for cigarettes will disapear because I know I prefer to be healthy. I will also read this subreddit often, just like I did with r/stopdrinking. I bought the Allen Carr book also, I intend to read it carefully.

I'm ready for war. :)

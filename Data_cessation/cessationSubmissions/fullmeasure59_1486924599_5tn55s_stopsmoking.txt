So this time I have to stop, for a new reason.

I've stopped smoking before, but never for more than a few weeks at a time before I would sneak a few singles or bum one after a night out.

I've never been a huge smoker, somewhere around 5-10 cigs per week so it's been relatively easy to stop for a few days, have one and remember why I don't actually enjoy tobacco that much.

However, I recently broke my wrist while mountain biking. One of my friends who works in joint replacement told me how using tobacco products of any kind drastically delays the recover time of broken bones. I also did some research of my own and I found several academic articles confirming my friends advice, though I will not include their links here as typing is a serious inconvenience right now. 

So that's that. I'm cutting cold turkey for the next few months or foreseeable future. Which means no gums, no vapes, not even a blunt. (I live in a legal state)

Here we go.

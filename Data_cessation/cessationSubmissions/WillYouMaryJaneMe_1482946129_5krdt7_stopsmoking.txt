Does smoking help anyone poop easier besides me?

I am on day two of my quit before 2017 campaign.  I will keep you updated but one thing that is hard for me is the fact that smoking helps me to move my bowels.  I'm not constipated without but it just isn't flowing the same.  I know this is a shitty topic to talk about on here but I'm just curious if this portion of it just affects me and if anyone who has quit has experienced this and any feedback they have.  Thanks guys!!

Rant about smoking

I have been on patches for two weeks and BF wants me to have nothing next week. I'm an introvert, get anxiety easy, never use medications, don't use drugs, don't use alcohol, don't even really escape into television much, and usually a workaholic online with the internet. lol I know all the mind hacks, meditation, fitness, and all that, it just gets me, I don't get to escape life at all. I'm ranting, because I've done most of my inner work. Point being I enjoy smoking, always used it to take breaks from work, school, studying, and was a relaxation for me. It's the one pleasure I had. I'm angry right now, I suppose that's normal and part of the grief process of letting go of a ciggarette. And shouldn't be such a big deal. I love the sensation of smoking, the flavors, the feeling. I get pissed because other people can drink wine, beer, smoke pot, do what they wish as pleasure. It's something i could do while I grew up around other people who were into drugs, alcohol, pornography, etc, without following their footsteps. I'm sure I'll get over it some day, but it makes me irritable, angry, and of course I'll end up fighting with people, because that is just the way it goes. And of course, it's my fault for being mean then.

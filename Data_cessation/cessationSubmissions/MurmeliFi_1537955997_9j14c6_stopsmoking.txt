If someone would have said a couple of months ago that I'll be smoke free soon and even enjoying quitting, I would've laughed my a** off

Well it's day 25 now. No fatigue, mad mood or depression anymore. Not craving or even thinking about cigarettes that much. I know urges still might come, even after years but I'll handle them if they happen.   
I think Champix (Chantix) made it possible now. Took smaller doses than should've and stopped taking them after being smoke free for one week. 

And if it's not Champix, it's the different kind of mindset. I've read Carr's book and it helped me understand the addiction and made me think it in a very different way. 

Oh well, whatever it was that made the difference this time, I'm just full of gratitude and still  in shock that this has finally happened!

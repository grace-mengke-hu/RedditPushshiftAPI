Anyone wake up feeling EXTREMELY disconnected for the first two nights?

I've been on a roller coaster of quitting after two years of not smoking.  Starting and stopping several times, mostly because of alcohol.  I've noticed that the first two nights I wake up feeling almost numb, like my whole body is like 50% numb.  Just an all over disconnected feeling, it's almost scary.  I know it's from quitting because I've been on and off so many times this year and ALWAYS happens for me.  Anyone else experience that on the first couple of nights?

Do you ever really STOP missing it?

I quit smoking for two years once. It felt easy at the time. I didn’t miss it at all. 

Then I went through a breakup and a vacation in a country with cheap cigarettes and no laws. Went right back to 1-2 packs a day, for another two years. 

I quit smoking 2m8d ago. Used NRT for a bit, but haven’t in a few weeks now (unsure of the exact date). I still miss it. ALL THE TIME. Like I’m sitting here wondering why I don’t just go buy a pack. I never felt this way last time. But now I just feel like it’s only a matter of time until I cave and start smoking again.

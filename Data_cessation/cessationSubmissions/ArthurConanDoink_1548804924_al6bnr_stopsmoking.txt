Anxiety subsiding, feeling great.

I've been having difficult anxiety every day ever since I quit. About a week ago I went to my doctor to get my heart checked. Not being able to sleep like a human due to intense heart palpitations I wanted to double check it wasn't anything other than the addiction messing with me. Results were fine but my doctor advised me to pick up some nicotine stickers and gum, as well as asked me if I wanted to see the psychiatrist for possible medication. I decided against both for the time being, seeing how I felt for a little bit longer. 

Tonight as I sat here I finally caught myself not being anxious like I've felt all these other evenings. My heart's feeling fine, good in fact. And I'm not thinking about a smoke. I suddenly realised how good it feels to just be. Not feeling weak, not thinking about the next smoke, letting my body slowly repair itself to it's more natural form and beginning to feel both mentally and physically strong. I've now been two weeks tobacco-free. If I can do it, trust me, so can you. Even if you experience harsh side effects from quitting, like anxiety, stay strong as It will pass in time. There are way too many benefits in quitting, for you not to. Best of luck friend.

Hello everyone! Never posted on reddit or really any social media. I’m 26 started smoking a pack a day at 16. I’ve tried vaping, Nicolette, patches and a lot of stuff. No results, I have a lot of anxiety which doesn’t help. Don’t work out either. Please please help me ! I’m sick of smoking so much!

Need advice on quitting, first time posting !

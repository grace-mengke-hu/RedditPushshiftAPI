I don’t feel like smoking 1 cigarette would turn me back into a smoker.

I’ll start by saying I have no plans to smoke a cigarette again. I don’t want to smoke cigarettes anymore and haven’t had a single desire to do so for about 6 months now.

It’s been a little over a year since I’ve had a cigarette. I see so many people here saying that they’re just one cigarette away from being a pack a day smoker again even after 2 or 3 years of not smoking. Maybe I just don’t have the same type of addictive personality as those people. At this point I would smoke a cigarette, feel gross, and have no desire to smoke another.

I just know I’m done with it.

The only thing I’ve done in the last year that had nicotine was smoke 2 cigars on 2 separate occasions with friends to celebrate achievements. Some of you may consider that my smoke free timer should be reset but I don’t think so. Smoking those cigars were not events that made me want to buy a pack of cigarettes. I’m still a non smoker.

I’m curious why some of you feel as though making one mistake would completely derail all of your progress. Do you guys not feel that after a certain amount of time you’ve regained complete control over your own mind in regards to that addiction?

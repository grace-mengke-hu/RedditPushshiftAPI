Feeling motivated!

So, I haven’t posted anything since my original post because I started smoking again and was feeling pretty discouraged... but on NYE, I saw a FB post from someone who has been smoke free for 2 yrs. I decided then and there that I was not bringing cigarettes into 2019. I’ve been smoke free for 12 days and I’m more determined than ever!

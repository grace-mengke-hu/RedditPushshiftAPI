Smoking dreams after first month.

It is a very strange thing. In the last couple of days, I had these weird dreams where I pick smoking again. I wake up and feel very guilty for a while until I realize that it was just a dream. 
What surprises me most about the dreams is that my quitting has been rather easy for me. Well, the first week was probably not that easy but after that I didn't have any cravings. Most of the time I forget that I even smoked and I don't feel any urge to smoke when I see somebody smoking. So what is it with the dreams? Did anyone have similar experience after one month?

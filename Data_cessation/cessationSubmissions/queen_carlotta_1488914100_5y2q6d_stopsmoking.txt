No More Smoker's Smell!

I just had a very strange sensation that I figured I'd share, I'm sitting at work 2 weeks in of no smoking, and my coworker (who is still smoking but "cutting down") asks me to go get lunch with her. I stand with her on our usual smoking stoop and shoot the shit, except I have no cigarette and she does. Go get food, come back and sit down at my desk. Normally after going outside I would've noticed the cigarette smell on my fingers/elsewhere, and then would go wash my hands to try and get rid of it. So I went to go do that and then immediately stopped myself -- wait a minute, I didn't even smoke!! Which means no need to go waste a few minutes of my life dealing with trying to rid myself of the smoker's smell! All in all it's a small change, but it crept up on me in a surprising way. Smell ya later, tobacco! (heh)

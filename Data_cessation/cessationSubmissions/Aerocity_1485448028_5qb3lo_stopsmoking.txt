Made it past the one week mark.

Thanks to the guys at my local vape shop, I've finally found something to take me off cigarettes. I'm still easing off nicotine, cutting down to 3mg from 6mg this weekend and I'll hopefully be off the stuff completely a couple weeks from now. Finally, something worked.

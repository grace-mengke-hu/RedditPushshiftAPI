When was withdrawal the worst, and what was the most unmanageable symptom?

I'm trying to quit but it goes like this:

Every morning I have great intent to stay nicotine free, as the night creeps in right before bed, Boom! it's all over.  

From a timeline perspective corresponding with most prominent symptoms and duration would be much appreciated.  And how do you feel life has improved without it?

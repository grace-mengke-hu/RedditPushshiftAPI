8 weeks in

Just past eight weeks of of being smoke free after 10 years as a 2 pack/week smoker. No supplements or meds, no nicotine free vaping, no reading aside from what this wonderful sub has to offer. I occasionally think of having one when I'm at the bar or driving but no serious cravings after week 4. Hell I still have one cigarette left in my coat pocket with the date I quit written on it as a reminder of the piece of shit I was and am no longer. I want to take this time to thank you all for posting and keeping me motivated.

I'm unsubscribing today [day 593], and consider myself totally quit!!! Here's what worked for me.

Hey guys.  I realized today that the temptation to smoke is completely gone for me, and I haven't even given smoking a thought for months and months.  I know overconfidence is foolishness, but I really consider myself totally quit.  Here are the things that worked for me...

* I live in NYC, and I called the 311 helpline to get Nicotine replacement therapy for free.  They sent me several boxes of gum in tapering doses.  I used the gum for about three months (not gonna lie, I know you aren't supposed to use it this long, but I considered myself very physically addicted to nicotine, after a 10-year habit).

* I started tapering off the gum.  Weirdly enough, I was finally successful in quitting the gum entirely when I attempted it during a very stressful time of my life.  I was very preoccupied and had a lot of adrenaline to keep me going.

* I deliberately did not go out drinking with any of my smoker friends.  If I did, I stayed inside the bar when they went out to smoke.  I had some random pieces of nicotine gum to get me through nights like this.  

* I stopped going over to the apartments of my smoker friends.  This was hard :(  Around this time, I got pregnant, though, so most of them understood.

* I told everyone at work that I had quit.  They positive peer-pressured me to not take any smoke breaks and everyone was very supportive.

* Being pregnant was awesome (not that I'm recommending it for everyone here, haha) because I simply told myself "you CAN'T smoke."  I didn't give myself another option.

* I also started working out a lot more regularly...lots of yoga and long walks really calmed me down and gave me a new respect for my body.  

I don't know how helpful that was, but maybe someone will find it interesting.  I respect whaat every person in here is doing.  Good luck to you all.

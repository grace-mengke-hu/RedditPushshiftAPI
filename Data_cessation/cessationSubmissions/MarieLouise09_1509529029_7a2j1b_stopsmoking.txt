Experiences quitting with herbal tobacco?

Has anyone experience in quitting cigarettes using herbal (nicotine-free) tobacco? I had quit this way last year and it worked very well for 9 months, then I relapsed after a very severe accident. Now, I am using the same method again and was wondering if anybody else has experience with it...?

For me, it is basically nice to still be able to inhale something sometimes while not relapsing back on nicotine (which was, in fact, the easiest part of quitting for me as the nicotine addiction was over both times after 48 hours, it is rather the feeling of not being able to inhale something that makes me nuts). Now, I am back on herbal tobacco (some are based on hemp, others use a mix of papaya, mint and hazelnut leaves), smoking only 1-3 cigarettes when going out or having a drink in the evening. I know, it is still not healthy as, of course, this non-nicotine tobacco still contains tar and such, so in the end, I will need to quit this one day as well. Nevertheless, I would be interested what kind of experience others made with herbal tobacco and whether it helped them quit or just reduced the addiction.

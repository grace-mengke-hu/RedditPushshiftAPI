First time quitter here

Hey All,

Based on what I’ve seen on this sub it looks like just about everyone has tried to quit before and is on a third, fourth, fifth attempt. In 8 years of smoking I’ve cut back or switched to vape, but this is honestly my first attempt to completely cut out nicotine and I’m approaching week 3 now. Anyone out there quit and succeed on try #1? (6+ months)

College student with some questions..

So I've managed to quit smoking this summer, haven't had a smoke since June 18 and cravings have subsided for the most part except maybe once a day I'll dwell on the thought of never experiencing another buzz which is kind of depressing for me. This is the fourth time I've gone home for break and quit only to return back to school and start again, I'm wondering if anyone has any advice for how to stick with it this time. I'm also wondering if the desire will go away as I gain more time off cigarettes or am I always going to have that lingering desire? 

Thanks in advance, glad I found this place.

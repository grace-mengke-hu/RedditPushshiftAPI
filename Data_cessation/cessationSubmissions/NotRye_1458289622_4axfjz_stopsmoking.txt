11 months, 333 days, that's a full house!

My big day is getting close, April 20th to be exact, and I'm very excited.  For months I considered getting a tattoo as a way of commemorating my 1 year anniversary, but it's too permanent for my liking.  

As of now, I don't know how I'll celebrate, but I feel I should make it a special day.  Maybe go out for dinner and pull out all the stops.  

Seasoned quitters, what did y'all do to celebrate your first smoke-free year?

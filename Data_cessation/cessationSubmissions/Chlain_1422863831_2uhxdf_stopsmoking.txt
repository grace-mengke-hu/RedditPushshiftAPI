20 cigarettes everyday for the last 15 years. Tried almost everything except chanpix. Which I should have tried because from what I can see it works pretty well. So one million attempts. 999999 fails. One 6 months success (cold turkey) last year thanks to... a $500 bet. I guess I must be a bit stingy. I didn't want to lose the money but I didn't claim the wager when I won because I am not that stingy after all and also because I had won much more than money at that time. I relapsed for the most stupid reason. But I learned a lesson and if I ever manage to beat the addiction again I will never make the mistake again. I am quite a heavy smoker. 100% addiction. I have never enjoyed it. It might sound weird. But it is the way I feel. Every single cigarette is a shame to me. There is absolutely no benefit for me. I don't lie to me or to others. If tobacco was illegal I would be super happy. The funny thing is that I am pretty strong minded for everything else in my life. But I am a slave to nicotine. The chemical is just way stronger than me. But I beat it once. I will beat it again. And when that day comes I will not be stupid again and I will keep away from nicotine for the rest of my healthy life knowing well that I am not strong enough to give in again. So yep, I am quitting smoking the reddit way for the first time. I will have my last cigarette before I sleep and will wake up as non smoker.

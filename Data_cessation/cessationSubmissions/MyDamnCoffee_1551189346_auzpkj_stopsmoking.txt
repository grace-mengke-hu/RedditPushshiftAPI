Zombie Smoking

I failed my second attempt in three days. I now know I need to finish reading the Bible.. aka Allan Carrs Easyway. However...

For a long time.. for about 10 years actually.. I wake up four times a night and smoke. And yesterday I went all day without a cigarette. I had minor cravings and I found myself repeatedly singing "i need a cigarettteeeeee" And then saying "no I dont. A cigarette isn't going to make this feeling go away."

I did great but then last night I woke up in the middle of the night like always and I smoked. It was an automatic thing. I did it without even thinking each time. 

Are there any other night time smokers who experienced this?

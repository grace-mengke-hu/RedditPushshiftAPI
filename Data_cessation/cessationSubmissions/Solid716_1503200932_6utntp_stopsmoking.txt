It Get's Easier

This is just a word of motivation for people who just started to quit. It get's easier, at least for me it did. I haven't thought about smoking a cigarette in over 2 weeks. After the 1st week was through I was fine. It was the toughest 1st week I have had in a long time but boy was it worth it. Saved so much money already and not to mention the health benefits. 

Good luck and stay strong!

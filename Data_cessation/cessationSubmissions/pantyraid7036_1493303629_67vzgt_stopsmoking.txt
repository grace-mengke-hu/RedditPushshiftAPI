regarding Allan Carr's Easy Way - I skipped the last chapter. Should I go back?

So I got to chapter 40 when I was on the bus, and decided I would read it and do the associated last cigarette when I had some alone time. I went out that night, continued smoking, and came home and just fell asleep. That was the night before last.

I didnt smoke at all yesterday, and didn't want to do the 'last cigarette' in case it threw off my whole day.

Now, today is day 2 and my skin is crawling. I know it's just physical, and that cigarettes make me feel disgusting and smoking one will be awful and just set back my cravings, but I worry that by not doing that last exercise of smoking the last cigarette, that I've thrown off the whole process.

Any input?

I made it through my work week!

So this was an abbreviated work week for me, only 3 days and now I've gone without smoking five days! My wife and i are about to go on a trip for her birthday. I never smoked around my wife so the next few days should be a freebie in terms of smoking. I'm glad I've made it this far!

I've been lurking here for a while. Just having the titles in my front page has helped push me in the right direction. Ran out of RYO tobacco last night. Think I'm ready to give it an earnest shot. Advice? Tips? Alan Carr bullet points?

I can't say exactly how much I smoke a day, as I've been rolling tobacco for years. Approx. 1-2 packs. Been a regular smoker for ~7 years. Haven't ever really tried to quit, but I feel different about it this time around. I think having stories from this sub show up on my front page has helped quite a bit. Also, I haven't read the book, but some of what I hear regarding Alan Carr's method is really interesting.

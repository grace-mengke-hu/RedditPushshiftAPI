Separating nicotene / alcohol

Hello everyone  

Was curious if anyone has successfully gone back to drinking after quitting smoking without starting to smoke again.  I haven't drank since I quit I'm a bit scared it will send me over the line.  Hanging out with friends who smoke for St. Patricks Day Saturday and wondering if I should just skip drinking altogether. Going to be a challenge for sure.

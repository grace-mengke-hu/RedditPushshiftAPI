Please answer a question for my 56 year old mother who recently quit smoking.

My mom has been taking Chantix for a couple of weeks now to help her quit smoking, and for the first few days it was going great - she went from smoking a pack a day to barely smoking one or two a day to having no desire to smoke at all. However, today she woke up with the flu - says her whole body aches, her throat hurts, and she's getting hot/cold flashes. She's been in bed a majority of the day sleeping. Now, my mom is someone who never gets sick (I seriously can't remember the last time she got a cold), so my question for both her and me is, is this due to the lack of nicotine? I hate seeing her like this and I don't know what to do to help. Any advice would be awesome.

I was afraid I would change

I was afraid I would be different as a non smoker. That there would be a part of me missing. I was afraid that non smoker me and smoker me were two different people and that I'd lose that spark of myself if I quit smoking. That spark, that powerful little pulse of life within me, that unique sigh of meaning and personality That I hold so dear hasn't gone anywhere. I'm no different as a non smoker. I'm still fun, interesting and right where I belong. The only difference is that I'm not smoking.  
That seems like a big difference to a smoker - but it isn't. I don't even notice people smoking anymore. It's a big difference in that I don't need my asthma inhaler any more. I've stopped wheezing. My lungs are bigger, a big gulp of oxygen is sweet relief. My anxiety and restlessness has significantly reduced. My self esteem is much higher. I feel calmer, more confident and I never have to worry about "not being myself" if I can't have a cigarette break. I don't cough up yellow mucus from my lungs ever morning. I never gasp for air after a night out with friends.  

Nothing's changed. I'm still me. But brighter. Stronger. Full of love and gratitude.  

I encourage anyone to take the first step. The first day was a struggle. The next two are hard because I was wracked with indecision. Then I wrote my addiction a letter saying thank you, it's been great, but firmly goodbye, and it's been clear sailing ever since. Good luck!

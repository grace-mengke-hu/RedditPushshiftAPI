Vaping and quitting smoking

I decided last week to quit smoking, but I knew I wouldn't be able to do it without any support, so I started vaping.

I'm on day 6 now and it's actually going extremely well, to the point where even smelling second hand smoke or the thought of tasting a cigarette is really repulsive. 

The problem that I have is I still have 2 pouches of tobacco in house (I used to roll my own), and I'm not brave enough to fling it away yet. Is it too soon or should I just bite the bullet and get it over with?

I've been using the 2.4% nictonie e-liquid in my vaper, and thinking about lowering it to the 1.8% at some point. No cravings.

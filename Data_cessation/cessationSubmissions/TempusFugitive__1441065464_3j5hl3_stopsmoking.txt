Day 100, the longest I've been cig free in 6 years

I've been an on and off smoker since I was 16. Tried to quit multiple times, most of them lasting ~2 months but almost always had a "cheat cig" once or twice in that time. Today, I'm 100 days without a single cigarette and it feels great.

I encourage you all to break free of the habit, it will do you wonders. Thanks to this subreddit for the support, as I have definitely been on the verge of having a hiccup, but I manage to sidestep the cravings by reading stories on this sub.

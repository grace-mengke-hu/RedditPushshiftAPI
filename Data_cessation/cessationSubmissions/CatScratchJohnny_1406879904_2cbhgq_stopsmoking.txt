Just checking in - tomorrow I step down to the lowest dose of the patch. 2 weeks after that, I'm "officially" done with nicotine.

The patch doesn't get a lot of love around here, but it has helped me do something that I wasn't able to do for 25 years. It has shown me a life that doesn't revolve around cigarettes. I admit I get a little scared and even have doubts regarding relapse and withdrawals when I step down patch strength and the thought of stopping it altogether, but I'm actually getting used to that fear and sometimes use it as motivation. I want that fear past me, and it should be soon.

I don't remember if it was on this sub or not, but someone suggested complementing quitting with good physical routines. I'm a couple weeks into a custom C25K and it's a great reminder of one of the main reasons to quit. Not even two months ago, running one block would get me so horribly winded that it was actually really upsetting. I'm now jogging a mile or more 3 times a week without even breathing heavy... the human body really is awesome.

Thanks again for the support.

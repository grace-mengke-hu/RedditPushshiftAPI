Itchyyyyyyyyyy!

So excited to see my new 1-week flair! This is the longest I've gone without smoking in years!
But I'm so ITCHY! I've heard that it's quite a common side effect as your circulation returns but also that antihistamines don't always work. Can anyone out there recommend something for the itchiness that worked for them? Cheers

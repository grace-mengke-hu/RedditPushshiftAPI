cold turkey or nicotine replacement with depression?

The last week for me has been quite strange.  I'm a woman and I started my womanly times last friday, this usually leaves me a bit anemic (from loss of iron in blood) and because it's reading week at my university I've been off my regular schedule too adding these things up I think I'd only had one or two cigarettes per day over the weekend while I usually have 3-5 per day.  Then tuesday I had to catch the bus about 4 blocks from my apartment and I was running late, so I ran (ran as much as a smoker can) to the stop, but missed the bus :(  So as I would normally do I had a smoke.  I immediately began to feel really dizzy and long story short I fainted.

This is what convinced me to set wednesday as my "quit day"  I was feeling really good about this decision, and was feeling almost completely normal until recently.  I'm prone to depression, and am aware that it can be caused or increased by quitting smoking, and while I'm not feeling sad I am highly anxious and I'm not sleeping at all well, which is making me feel like crap during the day, which increases my anxiety, which is making it hard to function normally.

So the mistake I think I made:  I have two midterms this coming week, and without sleep and with all this anxiety I'm afraid that while quitting is a good idea, my timing is not at all.  I have a box of nicotine patches, that I'm tempted to use to see if it relieves this anxiety some and helps me sleep, but I'm concerned that it will make me sick (or cause me to faint again.)

**tl:dr
I fainted this week and it scared me into quitting smoking cold turkey.  I'm experiencing insomnia, depression and anxiety and have two midterms this week, so I'm wondering if I should be using the patch or something?**

note: I'm planning on talking to my doctor, but wanted to get some advice in the meantime.

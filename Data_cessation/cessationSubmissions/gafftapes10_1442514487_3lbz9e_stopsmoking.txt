the voice in the back of my head is a dick

so after quitting on and off for a few months I'm trying to stick this one out this time.  last time I smoked was sunday night.  I'm not getting physical cravings, but there is that little voice in my head that keeps on saying one more isn't going to hurt, one more won't matter. I can't shut it up.  Its always really bad at work, where I am right now.

Alcohol and Smoking at social events

Before this post, I was nicotine free for a week. Then I went to a social thrown by my school where everybody was drinking and smoking. I caved and started bumming cigarettes from people. The weird thing is that despite not being even tipsy, I had to smoke because I saw people smoking with alcohol in hand. 

So I'm asking reddit if anybody has been in this situation, and how did they handle it?

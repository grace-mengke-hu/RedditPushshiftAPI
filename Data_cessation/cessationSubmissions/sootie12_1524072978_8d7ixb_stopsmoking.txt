Why is time going so slowly? ğŸ˜©ğŸš­

Usually the days/weeks fly by. Before I know it, it's the weekend but the minute I stopped smoking sometimes minutes seem like hours ğŸ˜¢. I've noticed that tiredness is my main trigger for a craving. 2 more days to get through to reach 2 weeks ... I WILL DO THIS!!

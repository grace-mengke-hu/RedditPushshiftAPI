15d but actually starting today

Hi guys! I’ve been reading you for the last 15d since I quit smoking. As you know that’s actually excellent news that I’ve made it this far and I’m excited with all the benefits I’m already feeling.
Now, I’ve done that as I came down to Brazil to see my parents and family and I’m returning to Spain today! As I speak I’m waiting for my luggage and preparing to walk out the airport doors straight to a cab no stop allowed! 
The big deal for me is that this entire country is a trigger for me. I started smoking when I moved here 10yrs ago. Everyone I knew smoked and I had already had some before moving here. I just kept going mindlessly. I can return to talk more of this story but point is that I truly appreciate your support now and all texts that were posted. I reach it every time I face a craving.
It was kinda easy back in my parent’s as there were almost NO triggers around.
Now, it’s all about it but the good news is that I start with the advantage of already being 15d ahead! 

All the best!!!

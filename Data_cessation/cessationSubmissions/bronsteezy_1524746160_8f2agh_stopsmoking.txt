Chewing gum (non-NRT)

I'm not doing NRT because I mainly am addicted to the act/ritual of smoking.  
  
I never thought that there was any "oral fixation" element to it, but eating did help me get through my many and intense cravings yesterday. I've never been a gum-chewer but today I figured I need all the help I can get and bought a pack. [It seems like there's only a tiny bit of evidence behind this.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9426794) Anyone tried it already?

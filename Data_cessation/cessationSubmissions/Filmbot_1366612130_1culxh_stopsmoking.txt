Starting a new.

Alittle about me, I've smoked since I was 17 and just recently turned 21. The whole reason I want to quit smoking is so that I can be in the best physical shape I can be before boot camp. I have meps in a few weeks, so I will have sometime before boot camp. I've tried quitting multiple times, just nothing to seemed to work. Patches, gum, cold turkey, all of that never worked. I figured with the help of r/stopsmoking and knowing that I will need to be in great shape to serve my country I will need to stop smoking.

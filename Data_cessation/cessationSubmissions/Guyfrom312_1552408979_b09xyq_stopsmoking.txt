I love nicotine. But I rather live

Ok so I’ve been smoking since I was 16 (24 right now) I could smoke a whole pack in a day sometimes even one and half cause anxiety. Since my daughter was born I switch to Vaping cause second hand smoke and smell is nasty. A couple weeks ago I was thinking if people with meth addiction can stop why not me? So I started lowering cigs day by day. It’s been 2 weeks smoke free I feel great and I will try not to put a cigarette in my mouth ever again!

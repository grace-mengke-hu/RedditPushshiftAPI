In college and going to stop.

I just ran out of cigarettes today and I want to stop really bad. I have not even been smoking for long, but I had to take a semester off school and it was really stressful and some how I started smoking. I don't want to smoke so I am going to start my path to quitting today! 

I know its going to be hard since I am at college and at the parties lots of people go out to smoke when we are drinking.

Wish me luck!

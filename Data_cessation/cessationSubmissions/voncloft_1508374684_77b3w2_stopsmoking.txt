I think I am finally ready to quit.....for now.

I am tired of being a slave to cigarettes. My "routine" lately has been 

That's it I AM DONE....throw cigarettes away.....Go to bed....Wake up.....Buy cigarettes......throw them away after smoking 2.........bum off coworkers and friends.........repeat.

I think I finally reached a breaking point - it hurts to breathe, my paranoia of possible health problems are an all time high, and I f*cking hate the fact that I will throw away cigarettes and an hour later I'm asking to bum a smoke - it's a waste of money and I feel like my pride plummets every time I ask to bum cigarettes.

Tomorrow will be day 1.....for the billionth time - I have lost count, my old record was 11 months - but I went back to smoking for the simple fact of "I just wanted one...ONE!!! - and I wanted to prove to myself that I didn't miss them and I've grown...bla bla bla" and Here I am wanting to quit again for good after 9 months from that stupid mistake.

Wish me luck and any advice is very much appreciated. I turn 30 on the 27th this month and I never want to smoke again!!

My biggest trigger's are  stress, and proving "I'm an adult...I'm doing adult things....LOOK AT ME SMOKE!!!"

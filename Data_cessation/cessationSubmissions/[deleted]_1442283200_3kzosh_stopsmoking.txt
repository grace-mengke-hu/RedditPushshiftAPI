I'm 7 days cigarette free in the morning

7:30 am Tuesday morning will be 7 days smoke free for me.  Have substituted with NRT (e-cig) at 8 mg nicotine.  Plan on dropping that nicotine level within the month.  Not super proud of being a vaper, but I have noticed an increase in smells and do not miss the chest tightness associated with pulling on those American Spirit Lights.  

Keep trying smokers, you can do it.  much love to the reddit stopsmoking community, have been lurking for a while.

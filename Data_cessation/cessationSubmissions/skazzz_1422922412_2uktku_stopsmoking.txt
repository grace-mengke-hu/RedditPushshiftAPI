Just requested my second badge.

I'm 31 years old, and I've been a pack-a-day smoker for 16 of those years. I quit for about two months last year, but fell into that old "maybe just when I'm at the bar" trap and now here I am a year later having to restart at the beginning.

I'm tired of having this monkey on my back, constantly being out of breath and winded, constantly having this bad taste in my mouth, constantly looking at active, healthy people and feeling jealous as if they're doing something I could never do.

I'm tired of feeling fearful about the future because I know I will inevitably wind up with some kind of terrible illness that will prevent me from enjoying life in my golden years. I want to look forward to my life, not be afraid of it.

So I'm done. I know it's gonna suck for a while, but I'm ready to go through it again.

I'm planning to go cold turkey. I have an e-cig that I am going to keep around in case of emergency, but I am going to try very hard not to use it. I plan to run and exercise every day to keep my endorphins up. Luckily, I work from home and make my own schedule, so this should be easier for me than some.

I'm in it for my health. I don't really care about the money all that much, although having an extra $200 per month definitely sounds pretty good. I just want to be able to look forward to twenty years from now without knowing somewhere that I'll have completely ruined myself by then. I know something will eventually kill me, but I'd rather be surprised than actively work towards it 20 times a day.

So, I smoked my last Marlboro 27 about 10 minutes ago and am no longer a smoker. I look forward to coming out the other side of this as one of you guys with a nice big star next to my username.

Thanks for reading this.

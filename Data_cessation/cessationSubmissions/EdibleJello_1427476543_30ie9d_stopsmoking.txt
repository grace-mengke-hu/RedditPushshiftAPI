I quit smoking on Christmas day, still have a cough

Some days the cough is worse than others and some days the cough is virtually non existent. It's been almost 3 months though and I was just wondering, how long could it take for my lungs to get over the garbage I was inhaling into them? 

AskReddit sent me here, I didn't know this subreddit existed.

Break-up reflections (30 days)

I am such a quitter... I'm so sorry I let you down. I never thought it would end between us. I just couldn't go on, the relationship was toxic. When I held you firmly and pressed you up against my lips, all I felt was pain and regret. I couldn't stand your scent anymore... It was everywhere, it drove me crazy. However, after we were done, I could smell you everywhere I went. I would lust after you and then fall into a jealous rage whenever I would see you with another. I knew how easy it would be to get you back, but I had to stay strong. Now that I am rid of you and your slender white figure ( and that nice brown butt ), I can breathe easily knowing that the cancer I felt our relationship was giving me is subsiding. And you know what? I'll always remember your name; Macdonnald's king size, pack of 25.

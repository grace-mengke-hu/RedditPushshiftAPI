Day 4 Summary

Hello friends,

I just completed day 4 and I have to say it was the toughest one, that's why I would like to share it with you. So far, day 1 went pretty well, day 2 was terrible, day 3 was fine, and day 4 was even better than 3 until I got in a little dispute with a friend. I was on my way to the car to buy a pack but thought about it twice, made a cup of coffee and went through the craving like a champ. I still feel weird but not worried, it is still too early into the detox, only 4 days. I feel fantastic I didn't fall for it and it is in part thanks to you guys. More to come tomorrow!

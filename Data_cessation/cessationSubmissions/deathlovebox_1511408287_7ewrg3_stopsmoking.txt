Im 22 hours into quitting. Is it normal to be just completely out of it, light headed, and pretty much zero ability to focus?

To start with a bit of backstory, a couple years ago I was smoking a pack a day ish. I then found vaporizers, which worked wonderfully at first, until I realized I had just replaced the cigarette addiction with a vaporizer addiction. Fast forward until about two days ago. At this point I pretty much smoke and vape. I would say that I vape about 80% (using 6mg nicotine) and smoke about 20%. So my last cig was a couple days ago and my last vapor hit was last night. 

Today has been very strange, it started out pretty easy but my mind kept of course floating to thoughts of vaporizing. Even found myself reaching In my pocket for my vaporizer, When I’m in my truck I find myself reaching for cigarettes. 

The cravings aren’t the bad part though. All day I have just been in a semi anxious, unfocused haze/funk. I can’t concentrate on anything I’m doing, and to top it off keep getting was of lightheadedness and loss of balance. The loss of balance is seldom, but being lightheaded is kind of persistent. 

Does any of this seem like typical withdraw symptoms? There is a slight chance I might have some sinus stuff going on, but seems coincidental that it would happen on this day. I’m not on any medications or anything. I think I underestimated how much nicotine I’ve been ingesting with the vaporizer. Any thoughts?  Sorry for the rant, it’s done.

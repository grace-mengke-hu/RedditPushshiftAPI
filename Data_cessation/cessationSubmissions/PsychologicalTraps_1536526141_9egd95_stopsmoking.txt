Quit for 27 days - Really hard not gonna lie (but worth it 100%) YOU CAN DO IT

I've always been a massive pessimist so when ideas about the futility and pointlessness of life were constantly circling my head as a kid.. smoking seemed to magnetise to me. And that very same idea is what kept me smoking. Why would I want to accomplish anything. Why would I need to live any longer. What difference does it make. Welllllll I'm here to say stopping makies a lottttttt of difference! Even though I'm still overly cynical in regards to a sense of purpose, its my general mood that has had massive improvements. When I'm overly sarcastic about something in my head I tend to laugh at myself a lot more.

What I'm saying is,  I still hold very negative views about life in general. But those views don't nag at me constantly anymore. I'm not constantly bringing up all these negative subjects in my head. It's almost as if smoking was the catalyst for all these horrible thoughts to clutter my headspace and drive me pseudo-insane.

The ONE thing that sucks.. is that I still get the nagging to smoke now and then. But you've just got to completely cement the logic in your mind. The cigarrettes are an illusion. The nicotine receptors will nag and nag you until you smoke. The 'Relief' and 'Relaxation' you feel is only because you're scratching the itch that was created by smoking in the first place. You will be MUCH more relaxed and relieved once the nicotine is flushed out of your system. The only thing to deal with after that is occasional nagging. But if someone nagged you occasionally to jump off a cliff, would you do it? Of course you wouldn't. Case closed. Let's all stop together :)

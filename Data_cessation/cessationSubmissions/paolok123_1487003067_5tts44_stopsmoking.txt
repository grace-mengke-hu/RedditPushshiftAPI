Day 3 please help

I read Allen Carr's easyway. it kinda made me hate nicotine and I never want to put any form of it in my body again. I'm on Day 3. at the moment I'm not craving cigarettes but it's like I'm SUPER HUNGRY so I eat a lot, and yet i feel like I'm still starving. I know it's the withdrawal nicotine pangs that is causing this but I kinda cant stop thinking about it and its depressing me like hell. any advice could be really appreciated

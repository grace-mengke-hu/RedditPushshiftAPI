I fucked up and feel miserable

I read easyway a month ago, was waiting for this moment for all that time to quit because I had exams all that time and thought I couldn't concentrate at all, but now that I am on a break and nothing to do, the boredom started killing me. 

I thought a fully stress free time would be the best time to quit, but now that I tried it feels impossible to pass all that time. I went out for drinks with a friend after five days, but I fully knew I would give in and just set up being drunk as my excuse. There really is no good time to quit, and now that I gave up after five days, supposedly the hardest time, it feels like I'll never be able to do it.

I guess I'm just posting this for some encouragement, since I still have two weeks to try before the semester starts, and if I can't manage it during that time, I won't be able to during the semester. That idea stresses me out so much.

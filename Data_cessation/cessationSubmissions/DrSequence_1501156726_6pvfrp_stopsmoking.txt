40 hours in, felt better than ever

Just had my 24th birthday last week. Almost pack-a-say smoker since 17. Never thought I would live without cigarettes for the rest of my life. 

I just randomly decided to quit once and for all 2 days ago. My initial thought was: what the hell, I'm just gonna stop smoking completely for a couple of days and see what happens.

Haven't touch a cig since and I just woke up. It's just the best morning I had in years. My lung has never felt better.  I have zero desire to smoke. I started to think the cigarettes are just the most disgusting thing you can put in your body. The thought of simply lighting one makes me wanna vomit. Think about all the tar, poisons and chemical you inhale each time, not to mention nicotine. We can treat ourselves better! 

I know 40 hours are not long enough to brag, but it's just the first time in years I truly feel good about myself and I'd love to share it with everyone! 

I might relapse in the future but I don't care. I've already done the impossible on some scale.

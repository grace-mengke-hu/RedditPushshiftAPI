Subscribed awhile ago... and the wife and I are finally taking our first steps! (again...)

We've both been smoking for a good bit and have tried a few times to quit before... but this time seems way different. I'm really sick and tired of wasting money and making sorry excuses to smoke, not to mention the bad coughs in the mornings. I'm really hoping it works out this time.

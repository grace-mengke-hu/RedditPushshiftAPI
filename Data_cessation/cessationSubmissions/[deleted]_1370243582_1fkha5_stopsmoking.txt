Not only did I quit, but so did my brother and sister. Screw you, tobacco companies.

My father smoked and my stepfather as well, I guess that's why we all picked up the bad habit at an early age. My brother quit first due to some heart/health issues and I followed in January of this year, its now been almost 21 weeks. My sister quit just a month ago and her friend is on the road to quitting as well. I have now reached the point where I don't think about it anymore and I avoid other smokers. Whereas for awhile I would have happily enjoyed their second hand smoke.

It's been a great trickle down affect for us all so keep in mind when you quit you are the inspiration for someone else, we all have the power of positive influence. And of course, thank you to this community as it has been my touchstone of sanity when I was so pissed off and feeling weak from all the withdrawal symptoms. For those still in the process, simply believing you WILL conquer this addiction is all you really need with the support of friends & family. That and a lot of distractions. Best to you all and fuck the tobacco companies.

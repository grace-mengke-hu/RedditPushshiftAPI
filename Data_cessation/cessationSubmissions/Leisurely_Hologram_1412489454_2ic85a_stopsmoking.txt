Smoking AND drinking!

I got out of the military almost 4 years ago. This week has been the longest ive gone without smokes and booze since then. My throat is a bit tender, but besides that, Im good. You guys have really been a big help. Thank you. You  guys gave me the key that helped. Each morning, while taking my dump, I say to my self, "I will NOT smoke or drink TODAY. Dont be a weak-ass bitch about it". Thanks again.

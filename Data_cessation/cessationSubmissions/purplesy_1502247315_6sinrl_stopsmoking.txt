Even a picture of a cigarette is triggering.

Anyone else feels like this? I try watching a movie to distract myself and have to turn it off when an actor lights up. I can't stay online without seeing at least a picture of someone smoking, and it triggers the cravings so much. I don't know what to do. 

PS: I'm 3 days in.

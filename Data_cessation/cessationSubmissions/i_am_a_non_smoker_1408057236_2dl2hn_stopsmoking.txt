Day 1 - The beginning.

So, I began my journey at 5 pm (EST), I'm only two hours in, and my mind already knows it isn't getting another cigarette.  It doesn't seem too pleased with the knowledge.  I've attempted to quit before.  Now, I have a 3 month old son I don't want to grow up around the habit.  Personal funds have been a bit lacking,  bills get paid, but no savings, or money for extra-curriculars.  My wife laid it down the day she found out she was with child, and I promised her I would too, It's taken me until today, but today is as good as ever, right?
Just as an eye opener for people who want to quit, with my posts, I will add my monetary savings starting today, assuming I smoke one pack a day.

Savings - 5.38

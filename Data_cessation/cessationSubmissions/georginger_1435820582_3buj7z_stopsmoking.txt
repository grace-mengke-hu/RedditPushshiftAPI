I'm so sick

I got the flu the same day I had my last smoke.

Since then, I've gotten progressively worse. Each morning, I wake up to a coughing fit. I sound like Selma Bouvier every time I try to talk.
I'm coughing up black gunk, and I have never felt this exhausted in my life.

But you know what? 

I can't even feel sorry for myself! I know that this is my lungs clearing the garbage I put there over the last 6 years. 


Even though I feel like death, and I don't want to get out of bed, I can't help but feel like this HELPING ME. This is my body repairing itself, and Jesus, it feels cathartic.

I just want to send out my thoughts to anyone in the same boat. When this cleanse is done, and we come out with shiny, fresh lungs on the other side, it will ALL be worth it. We got this.

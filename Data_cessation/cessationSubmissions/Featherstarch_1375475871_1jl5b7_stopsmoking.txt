I got an E-Cig to help me quit, anyone else have experience with these?

Personally i feel like they are like cheating but i did a bit of research and there's apparently far less nicotine per puff than a standard cigarette puff. I know i'm still putting it in my body but if this keeps me going for a few weeks i feel like it'll be easier to drop the habit altogether.

For anybody who still smokes, but wants to cut down or stop, i would recommend buying disposable versions of these. They are cheaper than a packet of fags (at least here) and supposedly last the equivalent of 40 cigs. It's as close to really smoking as you can get and just feels so much better. No burnt plant material so at least your lungs have some time to recover. Even if i don't quit altogether i probably wont smoke again, i'll just accept these things as a kind of healthier alternative.

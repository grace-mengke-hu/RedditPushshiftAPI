One day at a time but happy to reach 3 month milestone!

Being a difficult few months but definitely feeling the benefits of not smoking. Sometimes these milestone dates are the hardest for cravings! Yes, I still get them occasionally. I took the patch route to quitting, 12 weeks on them. It was difficult when stepping down the patch levels from 21 to 15 to 7, felt like going through withdrawals 3 times! I've being using this forum for inspiration for the last months, so great to see all the support here.

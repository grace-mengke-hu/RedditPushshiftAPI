Couple questions if you got the time.

Firstly, is the lack of sleep normal? I'm not getting cravings during the day, but I can't fall asleep like I used to be able to, I just toss and turn all night long.
Secondly, now that the nicotine is out of my system, I cannot avoid being around smoke, will small amounts of second-hand smoke put me back to day one with regards to nicotine in my system? or am I being overly paranoid?

Cheers!

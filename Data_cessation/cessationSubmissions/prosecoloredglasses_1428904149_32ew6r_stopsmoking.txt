Hello, day 6... Going off my patches today.

After smoking on and off for 20 years (heavy smoking the last several) I haven't had a cigarette since last Wednesday. I cut down for a week before that, from 30 to a few, then switched to a low-dose patch. Can't keep using those because it turns out I'm allergic, so now I'm just going to have to tough it out. I'm hoping the days of not smoking I've already managed will help motivate me through the next couple.

I've cleaned every surface of my apartment to keep my hands busy and get rid of the smell. Having a drink of water every time I get a craving, though I haven't had any really terrible ones yet. I think if I can make it through today I'll be a lot more confident.

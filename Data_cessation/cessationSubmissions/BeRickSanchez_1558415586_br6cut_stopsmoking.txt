SO and I are both almost 2 weeks

Then tonight my SO's grandpa just died. I stayed home with the kids while she went out with her family to be with her grandma. 

Everyone in her family smokes. 

And they smoke inside. (Ugh for all the years I have had this nasty habit I never once thought it was a good idea to smoke in my house...)

I dont even plan on asking her if she smoked I just hope if she did it was just the one time and we can keep going like whatever... we can't do the "one person smokes" thing because we work together a lot.

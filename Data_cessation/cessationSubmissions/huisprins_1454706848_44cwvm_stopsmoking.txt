Day 364

Thanks guys!

I'm off to the Alps to spend all that saved money  and enjoy the inhalation of fresh mountain air!! 

24 hours from now, 365 days ago I decided it was enough. It was one of my best decisions ever. 

Good luck for those of you still struggling. It gets much better quickly! Enjoy your life!

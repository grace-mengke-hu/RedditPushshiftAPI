a few days ago, i was at a bar...

...and a guy i was having a conversation with said "well, i do have a bad habit" while getting a cigarette out of his jacket. he threw it down on the bar top and i just smiled. really tempting. but i thought better of it. 

"hard to break that one..." i said
he got up and started heading out the door and said "well, until my doctor says i need to stop, i'm gonna keep goin'. i'm 63 years old!"

i understood his perspective. but i also felt, as now a non-smoker, something different. i was no more in line with that thinking. 

oh well.

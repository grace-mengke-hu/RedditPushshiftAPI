almost a year since stopping, suddenly dealing with triggers again

i have not smoked since 2/12/13 
i started socially smoking in march 13 and worked my way to moderate smoking, then when my exams began, my stresses went up and i began smoking heavily, come the 2nd of december, i had one of those "what the fuck am i doing with my life" moments and gave the last of my pack to a friend. my exams are happening again and i am suddenly dealing with cravings that seem to be stronger than when i first quit, it is at the point where i am breathing in heavily as i pass smokers again and even noticing food combinations that taste like smoke and even getting phantom smoke smells, any tips on dealing with this? i still have 2.5 weeks of exams ahead  of me and i don't know if i can handle this for that much longer
thanks in advance.

Gave in :(

I feel awful.

I was 17 days in. I was half way through my lungs clearing out. I had my taste and smell back. I just had the "quitters flu" kick in. I'd been successfully using a vape.

And I gave in. I've got a pack and a half to my name right now, and I intend to finish them.

I will get back on track by Sunday. But jeez, it sucks to have thrown out that progress.

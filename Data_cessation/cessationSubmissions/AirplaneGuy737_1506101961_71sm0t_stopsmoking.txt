Nicotine patch and sweat

I'm not sure if this is the proper place, but i thought it a good place to start. 

I need to quit. I've been trying for months but the gum is terrible and I don't chew it long enough, i can't seem to get an appointment with my doctor (they keep rescheduling it) for Chantix. 

The patches help my cravings but my problem is in my job. I'm a baggage handler for an airline. It's hot, I sweat and I'm constantly moving. No matter the brand i use, by the end of the day the patch is not sticking. I've tried multiple places on my body, wrapping it up to keep it in place but it doesn't stick. Even tried under my belt for the pressure but it ended up folded in half and falling out of my pant leg. 

I can't find a solid answer to this but, does the patch NEED to be adhesive to my skin to work? When the sweat forces the adhesive to be ineffective, is the patch still working if it's only pressed against me? Do i have another option?

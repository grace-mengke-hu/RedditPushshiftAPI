Bought a pack...

Went around my favorite store and a weird impulse strook me and I just went in and asked for a pack,he gave me one and I,without paying,started opening the package and as soon as i got rid of the plastic shit around the pack i remembered that I`m a non smoker.I might have looked crazy to the people behind me but at least i stayed and will stay a non smoker.Stay strong,cigarettes are still a huge part of my subconscious brain.

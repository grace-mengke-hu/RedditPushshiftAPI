I got 3 cancer candies left. I'm starting to freak out. I can't make it, but I'll try.

Hi there,

Like most of you, I'm a lurker here. I subscribed to this sub so I get reminded that some people make it (thanks /u/SLKSenior for [today's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/2gu5ip/end_of_day_9_just_had_my_first_beer_and_sat_with/))

So yeah, 3 cigs in my packet, and I'm full of doubt. 

I know that if I make it through the 2 first weeks, I will be free. I know that if I can just make it to 3 days, I'll have enough satisfaction and less urges to keep pushing.

I know that if I go through those 2 weeks, I won't go back. I hate smoking. I know that if I quit, it will be the most satisfying experience in my whole life, and that it will help me to achieve all I really want to do.

**BUT** I'm fucking addicted. No more, no less than you are/have been, I know that. The addiction is the same for all of us, we just react differently. And I'm just too weak when it's uncomfortable. I just can't refuse when my brain starts rationalizing. It already started. My brain just told me "I think today it's going to be tough, you're not prepared, you should buy another pack, and it's going to be really easy after that".

I know it's bullshit. I know I should just laugh at it and say "Yeah, my  dearbrain, that means you're healing :-) Just keep on telling me stupid shit like that!".

I know the urges aren't that bad. It's just like feeling a bit sick. And I have a huge amount of fruit juice to make it easier (thanks for this tip I got from here).

But shit, I'm freaking out. It feels like **I won't make it...**... It feels like I'm not in control of what I do. It feels like it's not me giving the orders. Well, I can control some of what I do, but for cigarettes, it's autopilot mode.

But I will try. I'll smoke those 3 cigs, and then I'll try my best not to smoke again, ever. I'll freak out, it will hurt, I may cry. I'll do all that, for the time it takes, and let's see if I can make it. Maybe I can still control what I do. I don't believe so, but maybe I can be stubborn enough... It would be like laying on the ground, full of pain, watching your enemy torturing you for some information, and saying "Haha, yeah it hurts! But I won't surrender. I won't talk, and you will be forced to release me after a while". Who knows.

If I fail, that means my addiction will have won a battle. But I'll keep the war, and desperately try again in a week or two.

To all the lurkers, we will make it.

And for those who are in the battlefield right now, [here's a motivational video I love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXGUNvIFTQw).

Good luck to all of you, good luck to me.

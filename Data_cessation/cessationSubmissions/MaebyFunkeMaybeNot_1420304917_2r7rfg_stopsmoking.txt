1 year ago tonight, Jan 3rd at 11:55pm I put out my last cigarette ever.

I smoke for 20 years and LOVED it. I never really wanted to quit until the last year. Then it was only a wish, I didn't think I could make it through. I thought every day for weeks would feel like that moment when you can't get out for a cigarette or that feeling you get when you only have a couple left in your pack and can't get to the store. But it wasn't like that, it was much easier. 
Allen Carr's book made me want to quit and understand my addiction, but I didn't do it exactly as he said, I used patches and e-cigs. You can quit your own way. 
I started by switching to an e-cig, mostly, then I limited the places I could smoke, like not in front of TV with a beer. When it was no longer tied to relaxation I picked my date finally finished the book (started it 4 years ago) put out my last cigarette and went to bed. The next morning I put on the patch and went skiing. 
It was wonderful those first 2 days, days 3 and 4 I felt a little sick but still determined. I had a few bad moments of  anxiety but realized that it was all in my head. I was wearing a patch, a step 3 in fact, so the cravings weren't for nicotine, they were for the activity of smoking. That helped me understand the mental part. I was on the patch for 12 weeks. 
When I took the last patch off I knew I was completely free. I was free to go to the movies without desiring a cigarette, free to really listen to people instead of waiting to go outside, free to eat a meal and just sit at the table afterwards. Free to smell like perfume. 

It has been a FANTASTIC year, I got married, got a promotion and quit smoking. 

You can do it, you just have to decide today is the day, the first day of my freedom. 

Good luck!

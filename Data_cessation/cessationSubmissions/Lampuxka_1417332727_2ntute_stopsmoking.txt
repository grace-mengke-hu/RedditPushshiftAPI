Quit for a week. With help of e cig.

Currently using E cig with 12% nicotine level. Sometimes my lung feels very empty and I'll become nervous. That effect will reduce after smoking 20+ puffs of my e cig. But I know it's just a trick of nicotine. E cig is not solution. My next plan is downgrading the nicotine level to 6% on January 1st. 
I've failed two times after I quit before. I don't wanna fail again. I don't want to be a failure. This time I'll be also focusing on changing the habit of my hands when it comes to social activities. Nicotine is just one part of my addiction. See you guys next week.

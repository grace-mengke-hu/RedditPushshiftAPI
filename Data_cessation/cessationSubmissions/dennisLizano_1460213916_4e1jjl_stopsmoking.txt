Stopped after 17 years

I was an early smoker; started in highschool just for fun with friends 17 years ago (time flies). I was a constant smoker, and never had that need of quitting even though I knew all the cons. Most of my friends smoke, so it didn't make any sense to be the only one quitting.

In a couple of hours I'll complete my 4 days after quitting. One of the main reasons why I didn't try it before was the fear of being just another person saying they stopped smoking, and then be there, a couple of weeks later, smoking with the gang again. I didn't want the shame of not being able to make such a decision and stand for it.

Well, I made it, and besides all the advantages of quitting, I stay strong because I'm the first person I have to confront and show I can keep it up, and that I can't break that promise.  

It has been hard; at first I didn't want any of my friends or relatives to know, because I was afraid they knew, and the face them after I couldn't stop. But I realized the more people I tell, the more comfortable I am with the decision I made.

Still a newby, but I've already felt the difference: My breathing is way better, I'm sleeping better, my performance in the gym has improved a lot... I hate the cravings... I really really really hate them, but then I've found myself doing "stuff" without thinking of a cigarette. 

I know it'll get better, I'm just impatient for that time when I don't need a cigarette. Reading about you guys being on the same spot, knowing it's possible gives me strength to continue.

That's my story, but thank you for the support too, I'm in the phase where I needed real bad.

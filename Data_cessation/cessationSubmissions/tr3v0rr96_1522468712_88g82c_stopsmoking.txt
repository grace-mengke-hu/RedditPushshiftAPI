I quit tobacco and vape using nicotine gum. Why don't more people use this?!

So last year, I was a heavy cigarette smoker, one pack a day, two on a bad day. I wanted to quit, but when I went to the grocery store by my school, 10 pieces of nicotine gum, the equivalent of a pack cost 12$ where as a pack only cost 5$ and I needed the money cause I was unemployed. 

After I started working at UPS, I became out of breath, and slow, so I figured, I need to quit, and if i have to pay extra money for gum, so be it. Turns out nicotine gum is wayyy cheaper in bulk than cigarettes. 160 pieces, a little over the equivalent of two cartons is 35-40$. I don't vape cause I don't like the phlegm and I like how convenient gum is cause I don't have to wait til break to get my nicotine fix, and since gum is so inaquous, nobody knows that I'm addicted to nicotine, and I don't look like I'm over compensating with a vape. 

Honestly, I love nicotine gum. People complain about the taste, Im like whatever, put in a piece of trident or something. if it scratches the itch, and isn't going to probably give me cancer, imma take it. 

Think of all the advantages:
-no gross dip cup
-can chew on airplanes
-arguably the cheapest alternative to smoking 
-arguably the healthiest alternative to smoking
-no more people nagging you about quitting
-feel more energy to work out
-feel more self esteem
-no one knows you're addicted to nicotine
-can buy at 18 in a state where tobacco sales age is 21, or at least at my Walmart here in Oregon. I'm 21 so it's not an issue, but I see the registers aren't up to date with nicotine gum. 
-buy a 160 pieces for 40$ and your nicotine fix for the day will be around 2.50$ for each 10 pieces, the equivalent of a pack
-you smell nicer because you don't smell like cigarettes 
-get less headaches, and no more nausea 
-get improved health in general. 

Seriously, I can't stop talking about how great this stuff has been to help me quit smoking and vaping.

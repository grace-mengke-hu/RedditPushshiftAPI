Day 4 of reboot

Different triggers than before. After months of hiding my relapsed from friends and family I find I have different triggers than my last quit. Actually I had these triggers before too but it's a reduced set of triggers. Gone are the triggers like being around family and wanting to sneak outside for a smoke. That was acceptable before. Also gone is the desire to smoke after the car ride on the way to dinner or a movie with the wife. The triggers that still remain are when I'm all by myself. Running errands today I had to remind myself that the goal isn't to not get caught smoking, the goal is to be done with smoking forever.

Just like before my wife is being very supportive. She loves me regardless, her love for me personally is unaffected either way but she does appreciate my better health and improved snoring reduction and stuff.

Nicotine patches with weird side effects?

I recently tried using nicotine patches and applied one to the top of my shoulder. After a few minutes, that side of my body started tingling like crazy and hurting at the patch site like I got punched. I pulled it off and there was an angry red mark where the patch was. 

Has anyone else experienced this? I couldn't really find any info from googling my symptoms. It makes me hesitant to use the patches again for fear that it might be an allergy thing.

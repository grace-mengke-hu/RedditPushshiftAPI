Day 38 - How I finally Quit or How I'm glad I bought a piece of Shit

It all started on December 19th. That was the day I changed my life. I quit smoking and started eating healthy. I bought an ecig and the 12 mg liquid. After a day of telling myself i should have bought the 18 mg liquid, i went back to the store and did just that. Any time I felt the urge to light one up, I took a hit. About 2 weeks later the pen broke - I replaced it. I continued vaping any time I felt like it - and soon I realized I was vaping gradually less than I was before. Day 33 the pen broke again, so I switched out parts with my old pen but I couldn't get the last of my 18 mg liquid out of the tank from the broken one and put it in the one I was about to jimmyrig. I was left with 12mg liquid and I vaped that for a day until the mouthpiece broke off of that. I rigged it with some scotch tape and shamefully took hits off my new scotch tape mod through day 35.

Day 36 I said fuck this shit. No more taking hits out of a scotchtaped ecig - I'm better than this. No ecig and no smoking - I am finally in control of this habit and have a growing sense of self respect.

I have also saved $190 since I quit

Savings should now exceed $200/mo

Start with the ecig if you can't cold turkey - it worked for me

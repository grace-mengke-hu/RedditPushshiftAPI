Just relapsed on cigarettes!

Hi r/stopsmoking, 

I'm active on r/stopdrinking , r/leaves and I had a bad cocaine problem until around a year ago. So I've had some issues with addictions lets just say that! I recently decided to quit the cigs as well because I plan on starting a personal training qualification. The two don't exactly go hand in hand.

Today I broke my 3 week streak off cigs and I've just smoked like half a pack in a few hours. This also coincided with me running out of nicorette lozenges. Basically I felt like relapsing on every single one of my addictions and so felt that cigarettes were easily the least damaging to me right now and so I crumbled. Pretty pissed off with myself because I definitely need to quit smoking, disgusting expensive habit, horrendous for my health and they're really annoying. 

I've bought some more lozenges that will arrive tomorrow but was just wondering if any of you guys had some tips? Are lozenges even a good idea?

Thanks

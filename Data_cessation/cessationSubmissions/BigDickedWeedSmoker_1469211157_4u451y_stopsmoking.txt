Question

So I had been smoking two bogues a day for one year when I decided to quit, so I was a light but addicted smoker. I went five days but then got mad stressed and so I lit up a butt yesterday. I'd been having nearly constant cravings for those 5 days. Because I relapsed, will the cravings get worse going forward?

Anyone else feel like this?

I picked up smoking a few months ago and yesterday I chain smoked a pack, I then thought about what goes through my head when I buy cigarettes and it's like there's a million reasons to smoke again but I can't let that control me idk maybe I'm just rambling but can anyone else relate?

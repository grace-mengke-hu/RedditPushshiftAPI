Advice needed

My husband smoked fairly heavily for about 10 years. Then he quit for 4, but would smoke occasional cigars and bum a social smoke once in a while while drinking. About 6 months ago he started smoking again without me knowing until I caught him one day. He was embarrassed and disappointed in himself. He quickly quit again using the patches and I helped support him and cheer him on. That lasted a few months and I’ve recently discovered him smoking again, sneakily. He refuses to talk about it and gets mad and shuts down when I want to talk about it. I have major concerns as he does have some health issues already and takes some medications he shouldn’t smoke with. This is driving a wedge between us in every way. He hesitates to kiss me when getting home from work, we don’t talk and I feel angry towards him.  I hate the way it/he smells and seeing ashes in the driveway and front steps. I know when someone makes a change like this it needs to come from their own will. What can I do to help my husband quit again?

Day one...again!

So I smoked around a pack and a half of camel lights from about 19-30 years old and quit cold turkey for about 4 years. Then came last summer where'd I decided to have the occasional good quality cigar.....it took about a year for the occasional good cigar to turn into 2-3 black and milds a day, dammit. Here we go again. Nicotine is a mother fucker. Thanks to everyone who posts here. Very inspirational. I've read Alan Carr's book, and will be referring to it a lot today. On the plus side, I have a gnarly cold this weekend so I already feel crappy...maybe it will help mask the nicotine withdrawal

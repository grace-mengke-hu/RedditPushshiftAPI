One year! You guys can do it too :D

Hey stopsmoking!

So today I have one whole year of not smoking. It feels sooooo good! I started quitting last year at 2am on new years day was my last smoke. I used the patch throughout the month of January slowly weening myself off of nicotine, and without the patch I really don't think I could have done it.

Previously I had cold turkey quit for a few months here and there, I vaped for near 6 months and had a worse nicotine addiction than I did from simply smoking. I smoked since 16 faithfully, and I was 25 when I quit. The patch worked for me, and I was lucky enough to pocket every dollar I would have spent on smokes this year, two thousand bucks!

So you can all do it too! Try everything, what worked for me may or may not work for you. The point is that if you take each day and say I will not smoke for right now, it does get easier, I promise. Yes I still think about it, but it's to the point where I can laugh and say, "yeah I used to do that."

Good luck on your journey and may this year be the year of the quitters.

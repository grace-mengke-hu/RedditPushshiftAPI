Need help. Advice? Tips? Warnings?

I've been smoking for around 6 years. I don't think a week has gone by where I didn't think about quitting, or wonder why the hell I'm doing it in the first place.

I've tried cold turkey, gum, meditation. I read Allen Carr's book. It helped. It gave me a lot to think about, and it has great advice.. but still no success.
Most recently I have started to try vaping. I know it's not the best solution, but I has gotten me down to around 4-6 cigarettes a day. It has also made them taste awful in comparison, which I guess is a plus. Also, it seems like everyone I know who has quit did it with vaping (save maybe 1 or 2).

But I just can't seem to kick those last few. Every time I get to the end of a pack I tell myself "this is it, this is the last one." Of course, I end up buying one the next day. I'm smoking the last one in the pack as I write this, and I'm so frustrated and desperate to just let it be the last one.

Was there anything that helped you to get to that breakthrough moment? Anything? I just can't seem to get there. I've come close. Made it a couple days once or twice, but it just won't stick.

Anything you have to say is seriously appreciated, good, bad, anything.

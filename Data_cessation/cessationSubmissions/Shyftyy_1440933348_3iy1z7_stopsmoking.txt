¨I don't smoke¨

 I've quit smoking in November 2014 and in between then and yesterday whenever I was offered a cigarette I used to say, either: ¨No, thank you. I have quit¨,¨No, thank you¨ or some explanation why I didn't want the cigarette because I am an ex-smoker. 

Until yesterday, when i was offered a cigarette and without thinking, I just responded with ¨oh, no, thank you. I don't smoke¨. 

It surprised myself a little bit but i take this as a sign that I have now sub-consiously made the transition from ex-smoker to non-smoker.  

It seems such a small thing but for me, it's a major milestone.

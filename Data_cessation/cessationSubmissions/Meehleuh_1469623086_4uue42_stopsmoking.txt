What apps helped you quit smoking?

I'm going to quit smoking starting tomorrow. Got myself some patches since i smoke a lot and have been smoking for 9 years. I quit once for 8 months and the patches helped a lot. But i'm weak when it comes to smoking so i though an app could help me. There are so many options so does any of you has an app you preferred? 

Thank you!

Made it to a week.

Well, technically eight days now, but that doesn't matter much. I'm surprised how easy it's been so far, but I'm not quite throwing caution to the wind yet. I've been experimenting with exercise as well recently, and it's been difficult, but working well as a coping mechanism. My friend talked me into trying out hot house yoga last night, and man that was brutal. I've never done yoga in my life, so perhaps hot house wasn't a great idea for a first try. It's wild though, I felt terrible for a bit after the class was over, then I felt amazing!   I haven't even needed to use a nicotine patch recently. That wasn't the best part either. I have a terrible time with trying to sleep, and I average between 4-5 hours a night. After the yoga, I had a full nights sleep for the first time in...I don't remember!  

Sorry if that was lengthy, but here's the message. 

Yoga. It really helps.

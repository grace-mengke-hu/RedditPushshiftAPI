Both my parents smoke. Quitting feels like I'm betraying them.

My parents have always smoked. I started to smoke because I wanted to emulate them, and a few key lessons they gave me spin around cigarettes. Example, "when you keep failing, smoke a cigarette, count up to 10, then retry", ...

Now I quit. Actually I'm not smoking for 7 days.

Though I'm happy I'm doing fine not smoking, in any situations when we would have smoked together I feel like I'm betraying them. Like "I despise part of what you are!".

I'm feeling distant from them, like true connection in my family was *enabled* by cigarettes. That makes me sad.

Has any quitter ever experienced something like this?

**EDIT**: in the country I come from people smoke a lot. Though people know that smoking is bad for health, shocking pictures on packs have arrived rather recently, never seen an anti-smoking ad on tv and I see being non smoker as an exception.

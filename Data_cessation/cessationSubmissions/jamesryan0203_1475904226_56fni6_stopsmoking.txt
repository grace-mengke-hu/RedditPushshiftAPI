I was doing good

One week today and I smoked. Drinking tonight and had to get an electronic cigarette. Gotta keep on been smoking since I was 10. Had a cancer scare and can't go back to smoking. I want to quit I'm tired of being scared. Gotta keep praying and I know He will take these cravings away.

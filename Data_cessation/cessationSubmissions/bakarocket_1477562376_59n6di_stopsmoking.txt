11 days and having a hard time.

Just lost it on my eldest daughter and wife. Kid won't do homework. Wife won't stop nagging kid. I'm an asshole. Drinking every night to fall asleep. 

Feel betrayed. Feel lost. Feel depressed. All for no reason, whatsoever. 

I thought these feelings were supposed to be gone after three days. I have a vape thingie here, but I keep thinking that using it will make the nicotine pain drag out longer and I don't want to use it.

I'm 40 and I've been smoking since I was 12. I don't even remember what life was like as a non-smoker. 

My bathtub broke, I pulled a hamstring and can't walk, my family just got through a fucking epidemic of the mumps, and I have a tonne of work to do but can't concentrate. 

Fuck this shit.

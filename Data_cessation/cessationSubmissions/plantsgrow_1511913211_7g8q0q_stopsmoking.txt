Yesterday was two years smoke free

And to be honest, it feels like even longer.  
I can't even remember what was going on the day I decided to quit. I think I had started dating a guy and he wasn't into it, so I said I'd stop, and I did (for the two weeks we dated... lol).  
But then I just kept not smoking. Until I just wasn't smoking, ever.  
  
At first, I would feel stressed and want a smoke, but that would pass. And now I still feel stressed but don't want to smoke. Smoking never helped the stress.  
  
One thought that helped me quit was "do I really want to go through the process of quitting again"? Like at the end of week one, I thought about having a smoke, but then imagined having to do another week as the first week... it helped.  
This sub helped tremendously at first so thanks for that :)

Going to quit right now (again)

honestly, I've done this so many times I don't even believe myself anymore. And this moping will probably cause me relapse. But I don't care, this time I'm going to do it. I'll start to respect my decisions. I'm going to use nicotine gum to do it. 

Fuck you cigarettes

Can't sleep need to smoke

I quit over a week ago but I'm going through a rough patch in my relationship, our friends seem more like his friends now and I can't sleep. I tried fb but no one wants to talk to me, there are cigs in my house (not mine) I don't want to have one but I do want one.

 How can I make myself feel better without giving in? I'm not hungry it's the middle of the night so I can't play my uke (to occupy my hands) and can't concentrate on the xbox :/

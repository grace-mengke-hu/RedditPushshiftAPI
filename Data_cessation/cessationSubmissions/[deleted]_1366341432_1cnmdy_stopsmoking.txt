Day 2 of quitting, lighted headed feeling when exercising?

I'm two days clean now and have replaced smoking with exercising. I do the same routine i used to do before my addiction but now on both days i got extremely lighted headed during my lifts, could this because of my nicotine addiction? has anyone else experienced this? If so will this go away?

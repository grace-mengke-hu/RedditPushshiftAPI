Blessing in disguise?

Currently recovering from a severe case of pneumonia, it’s the second winter in a row that I’ve had it. I had a stark realization that this is bullshit for an otherwise healthy 24 year old. It might just have been the kick in the ass that I needed though, today is day 20 since I’ve smoked and I’m optimistic that quitting will stick this time.

A HUGE victory for my lungs and respiratory system... I no longer have black spit.

I quit smoking on June 20th 2013, I used to smoke 1 to 2 packs daily... After I quit I continued to cough up phlegm containing black specks, sometimes it would just look completely gray....  BUT Yesterday I noticed something glorious in the morning;  I coughed up some phlegm and it came out completely clear.  

The gray specks have been less and less ever since I quit but yesterday is the FIRST time I have seen clear spit come out of my respiratory system.  This morning it was the same thing, my phlegm and mucus is finally coming out clear again... It must have been about 6 or 7 years ago that I last remember coughing up clear looking phlegm.

I can not express how happy this makes me.  I thought I'd be coughing up black stuff for the rest of my life because of how heavily I used to smoke...  I also want to let you all know that this community is amazing.  

I don't interact with you all very often and most probably don't know me but I am eternally grateful for /r/stopsmoking.  You guys are the #1 reason that I've been able to continue going strong, not even having a drag off a cigarette in over a year!!  Every time I get tempted to smoke I think to myself "But then I'd have to reset my badge..." I take quitting and staying quit extremely serious and I am proud of myself that I've come this far, at the same time I am so grateful I found this community.  It wasn't until I came across /r/stopsmoking that I even began considering quitting tobacco.  You guys helped impact my life in a very positive way and I could seriously cry tears of joy over the fact that my spit isn't black or gray anymore...

Thank you for reading this and please continue to stay strong!

tl;dr - I used to cough up black stuff but yesterday and today my phlegm has been 100% clear.  This subreddit has deeply inspired me and given me strength to stay quit... I am thankful.

1000 days!

I had it marked on my calendar. I don't really think about smoking anymore except to feel grateful that I no longer do. Oddly enough though I occasionally still have dreams where I am smoking, most of them I wake up feeling ashamed that I had started back up only to realize slowly as I wake up that I'm still a non-smoker. I quit with chantix. Good luck fellow non-smokers on your continuing progress. It does get better.

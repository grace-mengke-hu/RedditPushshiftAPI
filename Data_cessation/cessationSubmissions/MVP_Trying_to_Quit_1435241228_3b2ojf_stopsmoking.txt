Will have my last 3 Cigarettes and quit Today

Bought myself Nicotex from Cipla . I hope it helps along with motivation from internet and reddit.

EDIT- It would really help if any of ex smokers could share some tips and give me some advice.
anything you guys can tell me would be nice . Thank you so much for the support.

P.S- I am 23 my work involves lots of editing and i work at home that's why its so hard for me to quit.

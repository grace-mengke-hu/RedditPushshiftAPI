2 weeks tomorrow! Yay

This is my 4th time trying to quit this year. I always seem to go a few days and then in cave in and buy a packet. I found it so hard yet I really don't know why. 
I smoked 20 a day, and although smoking was band where I worked I would happily go the whole 8 hour shift without a drag. But as soon as I finished if would smoke and smoke untill the whole packet was gone! It was so frustrating that I couldn't let go of the fags. 
Then two weeks ago my friend said she read Allen carr's easy way to quit. So I thought why not give it a try. And to be honest I can't believe how much it's changed my whole game plan on quitting. It's something I can't explain but I honestly am not finding it hard at all to quit. 
Hopefully this is a new start for me and I can pack the cigs in for good! :)

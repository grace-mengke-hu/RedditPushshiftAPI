Gonna try cold turkey (as if I have a choice)

Taking part in a clinical trial soon, and they allow smokers, but only if you smoke under 10-a-day. I smoke rollies (which they've told me normally have more nicotine in them), and maybe 15-20 a day. In order to lower my blood-nicotine levels to pass the physical I'm gonna need to cold turkey it, without alternative sources of nicotine. Has anyone been through cold turkey? If so, any advice?

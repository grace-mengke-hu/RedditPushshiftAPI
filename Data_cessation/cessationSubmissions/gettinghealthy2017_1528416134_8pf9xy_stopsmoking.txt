almost a full 2 days in

ill hit 48 hours in 50 minutes. i’ve gone about 4-5 days once before but didn’t feel serious about the quit like i do now. im using the patch and so far it’s working but today has definitely been harder than yesterday. i have a headache and my sinuses are also acting up so it’s just more infuriating right now. i so badly want to exhale smoke but i’m not letting myself vape. i know it works for a lot of people but for me it’s just a replacement and not a way to quit. i will not smoke, i will not give in but ugh right now is rough

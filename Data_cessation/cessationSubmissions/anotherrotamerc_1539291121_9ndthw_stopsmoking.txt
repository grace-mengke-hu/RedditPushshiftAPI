This addiction is aggravating.

This is my second quit within 3 years. First was 6 months. This time is shorter so far.

This time I quit while in the hospital, and, until this week, has been super easy. The other night sucked. I had some craving while drinking and reached out in this sub, and irl.

The support was underwhelming, to me, as an addict. I had hoped for much more than I received. I felt that some conspiracy against me might be afoot.

Today has been much better, like night and day. I can give more details of this rich pageant that has been my life up to now, or you all can ask me any questions you may have. I'll probably even keep posting and answering in this subreddit. 

Any thoughts?

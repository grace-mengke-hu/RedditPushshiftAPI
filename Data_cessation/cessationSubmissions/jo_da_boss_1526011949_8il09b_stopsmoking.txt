Cravings at 10 months

I quit cold turkey 10 months ago, this is the longest I've gone without in 20 years. A couple months ago I would've said "I was over it, fully done no problem"...

This week has been a bit rough from a few factors, and for 3 days or so I've been getting a lot of cigarette cravings. Some of them are kinda intense, my brain's old go to method to deal with negative emotions like this.

I think this is one of my deepest craving triggers. I will not smoke but it's kind of crazy how powerful the pull is. They last for about 10-30 seconds. I know why I quit and I don't ever want to become a smoker again, but I would like for this to go away.

To those just quitting... it's way easier than you think it could ever be, but it's never free.

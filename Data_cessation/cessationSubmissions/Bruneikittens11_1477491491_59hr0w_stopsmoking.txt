Doing a presentation on the harmful effects of smoking and want to her from you!

Hi dear quitters,

I've got to present to a group of 30 military personnel on the effects of smoking and wish to hear from you all.

What are the areas and facts I should include to better put my message across and how should I do it?

What was it that made you decide you wanted to quit and what helped you follow through with your decision?

Would including messages from people who developed diseases because of smoking be a good idea?

Please, do share your stories and ideas.

Thanks!

Someone's smoking in my apartment building.

This is a non-smoking complex, but I can definitely smell it. It's weird, it's been almost a week, and I haven't really encountered any strong triggers nor have I been agitated (except for a little today). I don't really miss smoking. I've walked by smokers in the street, no problem. I've gone into a few gas stations and bought nothing but diet soda and gum. But this smell right now is killing me. It's like when a cartoon character puts a pie in a window to cool and the scent vapors form a hand that wafts out to beckon passersby. Grr. I guess I should just be glad that I can smell again.

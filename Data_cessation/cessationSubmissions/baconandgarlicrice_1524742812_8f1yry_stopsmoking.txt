Ran a 10K race at a personal record time!!!

Hi. I quit exactly a month ago, after smoking for 10 years and several quit attempts that never lasted more than a week.

This time I was just tired of being known as a smoker, so I decided to change that. I took up running again (which i'd been doing casually even as a smoker---now that i look back it seems stupid that i used to go for runs then chainsmoke right after). I signed up for a big 10K event, haphazardly tried to squeeze in training two weeks before the race...

And made a personal best record. I didn't do spectacularly, 59 minutes, but I had never run a 10k at that pace before. Never been able to.

Nowadays my legs get tired faster than my lungs, and it feels great. Hang in there, yall!! Exercise DOES help a ton. Find a physical activity you enjoy, and suffer a little, then reward yourself. 

I also bought new running shoes with the money I saved not smoking.

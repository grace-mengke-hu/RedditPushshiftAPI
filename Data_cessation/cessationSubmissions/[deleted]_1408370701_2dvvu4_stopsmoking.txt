Miss my addiction

Weird thread but, does anyone feel like a part of their lives is in the past once past the smoking addiction? I no longer crave cigarettes, and even if I have one, I wouldn't enjoy the moment. I remember when smoking one would be such a craving, and such a relief. Now because I've fought the addiction so long it does nothing for me, even if I had a catastrophic life event it wouldn't be my go to stress relief. It's a blessing but feeling nostalgic haha

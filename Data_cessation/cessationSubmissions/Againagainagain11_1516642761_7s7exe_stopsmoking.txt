Day six is almost over... It's getting harder [vaping]

I quit on Tuesday night. I was doing better on the weekend, but now I really want to smoke.

I'm vaping because I tried cold turkey but it was so stressful that I cracked.

This time it has been easier. I have gotten farther than ever before in twelve years of smoking. But I wonder if my craving to smoke will ever really disappear as long as I am vaping.

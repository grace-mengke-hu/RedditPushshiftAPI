95

That's the number of cigarettes I haven't smoked, that I normally would have.  Just thinking, it may be more comfort, for those of us just starting out, to count something that will move faster than the days.  At least early on.  A bit more motivation, than waiting another 24 hours for one digit to tick into another day.

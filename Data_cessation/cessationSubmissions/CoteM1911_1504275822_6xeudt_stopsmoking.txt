Found a MAJOR disadvantage to quitting...

A customer just came in to my work, he does every month, and every month I know he has somewhat of an odor.... 

I literally stifled a fucking gag just now. I had NO idea how bad it really was until I quit smoking. Jesus Christ in heaven, my eyes watered a little. 

Anyways, I'm looking forward to use the new found sense of smell for more pleasant things... cause good god........... that was brutal.

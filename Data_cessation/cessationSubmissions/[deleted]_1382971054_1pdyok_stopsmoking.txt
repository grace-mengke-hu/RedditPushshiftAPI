My little victory

Yesterday I had a day off, my only day off and I had a bunch of stuff to get done which, in turn made me very stressed out all day. I had a one track mind "I want a cigarette, I need a cigarette." and my favorite "Just one won't hurt, I can start again tomorrow" BUT I didn't. I told myself that I just wanted a cigarette but that I don't need one. I woke up today and I'm so happy I didn't smoke.

Continue on everyone!

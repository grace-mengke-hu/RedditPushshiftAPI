Something I don't miss

That feeling I used to get when leaving home without my cigarettes, either having to run back to get them or agitatedly struggling through a walk or a car journey until I got to somewhere I could buy more.

Going to a music festival or camping- making sure I had 5 packs at least so I wouldn't run out, and then getting pissy and upset when I did smoke them all.

I couldn't go a second without having that little box in my pocket or I would get stressed out.


Why the hell did I think those were good things.

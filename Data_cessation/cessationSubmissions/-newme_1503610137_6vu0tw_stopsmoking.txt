Relapse after 2 weeks I feel bad

After 10 years heavy smoking I managed 2 weeks without, also didn't use my e cig or any supplements. Today I was out with friends, partying after the 5th beer my will was weakened and I gave in, smoked 4 cigs that night. I really feel bad now, it kind of extinguishes my progress..any advice?

Well, my first step of quitting cigs has been taken.

Due to the prices going up, my mom and I have decided to quit together. April 2nd was our last day. And we just flushed our cigarette butts down the toilet together as some kind of ceremony. 

So here we go. Day one. Wish us luck! 

I deal with really bad anxiety, so I know this is going to be rough, but I'm hoping my klonopin will aid a bit. And if it gets too bad, I'm going to just hit the gym or go on a walk. Any other tips would be great! 

love to all.

Almost through day 3!!! cravings hitting me like a smoke filled tsunami

Smoker for 6 years at my peak smoked a pack and a half a day but over the last year or 2 down to 10ish a day, on weekends a pack. I'm also quitting the camel sinus pouches like the ones you don't have to spit. I'm in college and everyone drinks and smokes. It's tough but I know it's time for me to stop. I really need to stay strong this weekend while drinking. I know how unattractive it is when I see girls smoke. I can only imagine how gross it is when girls see me in a cloud of smoke. I'm just tired of feeling like trash and always having to plan my night around cigs. Plus I never feel any better after I smoke then before. This isn't my first swing at quitting but I'm hoping reddit can help support or distract me from my constant cravings. My lungs feel real congested but I'm pushing through. Just need to make it to the release of GTA V. That should keep my mind occupied for the next few months haha well wish me good luck cuz nicotine is a son of a $&*%# that tricked me in the first place.

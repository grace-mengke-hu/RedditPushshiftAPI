1 month quit by coincidence!

Some background first, used to smoke about 2 packs a week, for  9 years+.

Now, I got the flu a month ago, and the second day in I decided to stop smoking to help my body recover. A week in I started getting better had cravings but it also felt really good to take a deep breath. So I stayed off. Then I dusted off my old bike fixed it up and went on a long bike ride. Last time I went this far I started getting tired. This time it felt enjoyable!  So I'm keeping this up. The cravings are dying but not enough to break a 30 day streak!

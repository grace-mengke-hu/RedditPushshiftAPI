Hey there guys! I'm New.

After about a year and a half sober, I'm finally ready to quit smoking. I bought some patches, but I was surprised how long they recommend using them. I smoke about 8-12 cigarettes a day and got the step 1 patches. I want to try just using one of these each day for a week, then going to step 2. Advice and suggestions are welcome.

Seem to have trouble the longer I go?

Lat time I quit I was fine until the 12th day, and then I just said "F IT". I wanted to relax.  I wanted a reward.  I wanted a cup of coffee and a cigarette.  This time, I had the same feeling on my 11th day...sat outside a store for 30 minutes debating about going to buy a pack.  Called a friend and didn't buy the pack.  14 days now and it feels good.  Don't even want to say that to jinx myself.  Hope I can maintain long term and not get the "F IT's" again.

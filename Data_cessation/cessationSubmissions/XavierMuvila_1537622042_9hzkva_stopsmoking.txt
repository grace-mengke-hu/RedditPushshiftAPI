I've quit once a bunch of times

I've been smoking for over a decade. None of my 7 kids remember a time that I didn't smoke. There was about 6 months a few years back when I didn't smoke, but I doubt they remember it. That was my most successful time quitting. Most times, it has only lasted a day or maybe a week. Last week, I made it 22 hours without a cig. I live in Florida, where smoking in the bar is up to the management. I get disappointed if I go to a bar and they don't have ashtrays on the bar.
But I need to change that, so I'm planning on quitting (again) this week. This time for good. I spend about $2300 a year on cigarettes. I'm planning a vacation at the end of April that would cost me around $1500 or so. Quitting smoking alone would nearly pay for that whole vacation between now and then. 
My girlfriend is a dental assistant. My teeth look terrible from all the staining and everything. I have no idea why she's put up with it for so long.
I'm resolved to quit in the next 5 days. I'm tired of it. I hate the fact that I'm smoking right now while I type this. But I'm done with it, and I'm resolved that this time is going to be the last time I quit.

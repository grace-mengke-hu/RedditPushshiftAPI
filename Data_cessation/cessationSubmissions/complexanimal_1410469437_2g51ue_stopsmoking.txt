Ran the gauntlet and didn't smoke during Eurotrip: No Smoking Fund has gone international.

I've tried quitting several times in the past with varying success--the longest attempt lasting a little over a year.  The one thing that would always trip me up is the vacation.  Whenever I would leave for a long trip, I would think, "hey, I'm on vacation, I can just smoke while I'm away and stop when I get back."  We all know how well that works.

Although this attempt at quitting has only lasted about 2 months at this point, 3 weeks of it included a tour through Europe with my best friend who's a social smoker.  Might I add, in Germany, some bars at night allow smoking, so I was drinking AND getting the stuff blown in my face.  I endured it all and didn't take a single drag.

Although not my longest attempt at quitting, I think this is a huge moment for me.  I feel much more strongly convinced than I ever have that I've finally kicked this disgusting habit in the ass once and for all.

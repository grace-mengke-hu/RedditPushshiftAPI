Only at day 3

Day 3 and honestly I'm feeling pretty good. Slept well, exercised, got some work done, now ready for some Netflix.

Getting kind of worried about Saturday though. Expected to attend a party in the city and there will be alcohol flowing which I'm afraid may loosen my resolve and lead me to bum off someone outside the bars. Probably going to 'take it easy' on drinking just because this quitting is so new.

Any advice to mentally prepare myself for those alcohol induced cravings?

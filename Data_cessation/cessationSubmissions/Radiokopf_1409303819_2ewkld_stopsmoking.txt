First time out!

Hello ladies and gentelman :)

I've made it 3 weeks, and it wasn't hard at all. But now comes the first weekend i plan to go out and drink again. That often has been my tripping point. Now it its not gonna happen i won't smoke.I want my star, and my health. Just wanted to say that :)

have a nice day!

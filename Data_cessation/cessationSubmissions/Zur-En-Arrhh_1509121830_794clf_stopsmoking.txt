Ten days ago I moved across the country, ten days ago I quit smoking.

I got a new job and moved into a new house and quit smoking very easily, after smoking for over ten years.  Today has been a challenge though, it's been about three hours that all I can think about is smoking, I thought the cravings were supposed to go away after a few minutes....

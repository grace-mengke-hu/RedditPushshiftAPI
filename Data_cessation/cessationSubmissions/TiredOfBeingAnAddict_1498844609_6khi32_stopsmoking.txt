60 Days! | It really is even better than you imagine it can be.

I've not smoked a cigarette in sixty days. I am so proud of myself. I've made a lot of other life changes since then. But Smoking was clearly my negative keystone habit.

I spent my twenties being a smoker and frankly very little that was good or worth remembering occurred to me in that decade. I am not consumed by despair over this fact. Instead I am so freaking energized and motivated to squeeze every drop out of the life I have left.

If you are trying to quit, know this. It is not easy. Nor is it fun at first. But big picture, take it from one guy on the Internet; quitting smoking has fundamentally shifted my world off its axis. I am already a completely new person and it's only been two months. My vigor has returned. When I see friends or family who have not seen me over the last two months, their jaw literally drops.

I'll grant that just not smoking isn't enough. To get the results I've gotten, you'll need to focus on the big three: sleep, diet, and exercise. But for me, I hadn't a chance in hell of ever taking those things seriously whilst a smoker.

Smoking is awful. It contributed to me quite literally being an awful person. I highly recommend you quit. It won't be easy but y'all never once genuinely doubt if it's "worth it." That's a promise.

I will remain vigilant in my quest to persist as a non-smoker. But today's post is a celebration of what life can be without a crippling addiction like cigarettes in my life.

Thanks for reading. Good luck to everyone. Go confidently in the direction of your dreams!

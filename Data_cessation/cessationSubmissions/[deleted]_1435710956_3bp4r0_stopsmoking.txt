Resetting the bad :(

I did a stupid thing.  I was at a conference with a high level boss and he went out for a smoke.  What a good way to smooze, right? Well it worked, I got closer to him.  Even Alan Carr said that the social aspect is a plus (not as much anymore) but I caved.  But now I want another one? I had JUST gotten the cravings to a manageable state.  WTF!!!!

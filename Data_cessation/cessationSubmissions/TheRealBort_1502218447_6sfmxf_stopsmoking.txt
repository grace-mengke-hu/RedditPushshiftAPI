Am I the only one ....

who gets physical cigarette taste in my mouth when I am around something that is a trigger for me to smoke.  An example would be while drinking, I get a sudden distinct taste that reminds me of smoking.  It is so hard to resist and makes not having a smoke so much harder.

I have been trying to quit for a very long time, I have done various things but am just doing it cold turkey now.  Its been about a week and half since my last smoke.

This is the first year 'quit smoking' is not on my list of New Year's Resolutions

I made it through most of 2018 without smoking. I beat the seasonal cravings and made it through Christmas without smoking. This is the first New Year I'm starting completely as a non-smoker. It feels good to scratch 'quit smoking' off the list of resolutions.

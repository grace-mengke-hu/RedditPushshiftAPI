Day 1, (real) try 4...

26 year old female here. Started smoking because I grew up in a smoking family. I'm away from that family now, happily married for just under a year. I've been smoking on and off since I was 18, and I'm just sick and tired of feeling sick and tired, having awful smelling fingers, and being self-conscious about my breath/teeth/kissing taste. 

I remember when I quit last time, I had tea, and I could taste the peach. Like *really* taste it. And I was so excited. I was 7 1/2 months into my quit and so sure I could do it. And then I contacted my family again.

Well, due to unfortunate circumstances, most of the family I spoke to is dead now, so there's no ghosts to haunt me. (or maybe there are now? Idk) So I figure now is a good of a time as any to just put down the pack for good. 

I'm doing it for my husband, my dog, myself. I'm doing it because I hate having to lie down after every cigarette because I'm completely worn down. I hate having this clockwork inside my brain. I can tell time by how bad my cravings are and that's just bullshit. A few weeks ago I unwittingly ramped up my cigarette intake, so instead I'm cutting myself off. 

My husband had a similar alcohol experience recently, and he's kinda quit drinking, so now is a great time to just follow suit, and stop smoking. 

Tomorrow will be the first full day. I hope nothing too terrible goes wrong.

A little bit disheartening to know

I've been quit for 2.5 weeks now and am going strong. I still have 1-3 strong urges a day when I think about smoking but they are manageable. The only time it gets pretty rough is after a few homebrews but then I just snack on a cheese plate or do a few pushups and it passes. I was really looking forward to day 21, like in Carr's book and from what I've read elsewhere, being this magical number of days when I won't have it nearly as bad anymore. It's been disheartening to know that a lot of you still experience strong and very real cravings months and months passed your quit date. I know I am up to the challenge, it just sucks. 

I realize now that smoking for almost 20 years won't be undone in my mind in a matter of days. I just didn't realize I would have to be mentally strong a lot further out then 3 weeks. From what I read, it will basically be a few years before I finally go months without any kind of thought of smoking. 

Stay strong, quit buddies.

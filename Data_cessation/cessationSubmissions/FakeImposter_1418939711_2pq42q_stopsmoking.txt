Just decided to quit

I have been smoking Marijuana and Cigarettes since I was 15, now I'm 18. I usually smoke much more cigarettes because I personally enjoyed those more but now I have decided to quit instead as I think it will be harder to quit as I get older and improve my health so I can play more sports and do more activities instead of spending all day smoking.

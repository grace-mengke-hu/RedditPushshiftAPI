...and then my vape mod broke

On day 4 of a quit, after twenty years of smoking. I've been vaping as a NRT, and it's been working wonders. I haven't been irritable like during past quits, and between that, this forum, and an app I've been using, it's all been a pretty manageable quit so far.

This morning, though, my vape mod broke. The shop is just up the street, and I'm sure they could fix it in thirty seconds (looks like my coil just shorted out, but I don't have any spares), but they don't open until 10am and I have meetings all day. I actually considered taking the day off because of this, which is ridiculous.

I picked up a disposable e-cig on my way into work, but I can already tell it's not going to accomplish anything. So today's gonna be a rough day, full of triggers (almost everything to do with any meeting, and I have a bunch today), but I'm gonna make it through. Send me good wishes, haha!

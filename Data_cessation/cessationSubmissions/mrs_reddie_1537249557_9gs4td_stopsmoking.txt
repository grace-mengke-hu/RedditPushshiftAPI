threw out my pack before i got addicted

i started a couple months ago so i'm definitely not a heavy smoker or a serious one or anything. told myself i'd only buy the one. and if i bought another one it would be next year. anyway. a few weeks went by and i bought my fourth pack today and i smoked maybe 5? out of the whole thing and just threw it away. i just felt guiltier and guiltier it was no longer something i even really liked and i just thought fuck it i'll chuck it and never buy another one so here's hoping i stick with that and never get addicted.

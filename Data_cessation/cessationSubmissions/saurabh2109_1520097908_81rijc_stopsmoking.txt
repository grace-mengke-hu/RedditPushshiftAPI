Quitting cold turkey. Smoking for 15 years.Already afraid.


Hi folks,

This is the last pack of my cigarettes here.
I have finished Allen Carr's book , as well as o have done tonnes of reading at whyquit.com
I have decided to go cold turkey.

I have been following various subs here on stop smoking. I really want to do it. I feel like a slave to nicotine. In last 6 months there have been at least 30 nights where I sat with my *last* pack,
Read whyquit or Allen Carr or some other stuff on internet, made the resolution to quit , stopped for a day or two and relapsed.
Maximum I have gone through without cigarettes is 15 days,it was an year ago.I even don't know why I relapsed.
I am a computer programmer, I love my job, i love my family, for last couple of years cigarettes have been interrupting all the things I love.
My concentration levels have gone down. I look for opportunities to be alone so that I can smoke.
Sometimes it seems I only enjoy smoking and nothing else. I seem to have lost interest in music,movies,programming and even family if I am not allowed to smoke.

I really need to beat this monster. why am I so afraid?
Why can't I handle the cravings?
Am I not ready to quit?
Please help me.

Cigarette breathe

Hello fellow quitters! I recently gave up smoking, today is day three. This sub has been a great help! I was curious as to when your SO noticed that your breathe didn't taste like an ashtray. Is their something akin to a time line that is helpful for such a question? I would like to start dating soon, but I would rather not have to deal with being self concious about how bad my breathe smells if we happen to kiss. If it helps, I smoked for about two years, two to three packs a week. Much appreciated!

Quit Yesterday, getting involved.

I usually have problems getting involved with things like this sub. I tell myslef that quitting is my own problem and that only I can control it. 

That hasn't worked before.

Now, I'm reaching out to this sub, to my girlfriend and family. I'm not going to be above needing help this time! Qutting is my problem, but maybe this will help. 

Reading through the top posts of this year has already been helping. The pride that people have in reaching milestones is inspiring.

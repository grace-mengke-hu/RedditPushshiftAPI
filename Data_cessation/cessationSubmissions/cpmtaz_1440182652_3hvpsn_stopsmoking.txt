Quitter's Flu *starts* at 19 days? What gives?

Has anyone else had quitter's flu that began *weeks* after quitting? I've done ample research about the symptoms of withdrawal and quitting and it seems most quitter's flu happens within the first week or so. It's been 20 days now and yesterday I woke up with a terrible sore throat and feel terrible. 
Also, a very strong depression has hit me like a ton of bricks. 
I do not feel glowing and radiant and healthy. 
My skin looks like shit, I have gained at least 5-7 lbs, I'm sad and mopey, still have no energy and feel like there's an evil cigarette monster in my brain that is pulling out all the stops to entice me into lighting up again. Luckily, my mind has cleared  just enough to see him up there, behind his curtain, concocting these evil plans.
Well, you know what, cig monster... Fuck You.

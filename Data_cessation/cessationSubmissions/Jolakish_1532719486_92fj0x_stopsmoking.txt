15 days in and feeling weaker than the beginning

Hi all. Love this board, it’s helped me through really tough moments. Thanks to everyone for being supportive and kind. 

I’ve been smoking for 8 years. This is my fourth time trying to quit—I always start back up around three weeks in. And, as has happened time and time again, I find myself bargaining with myself: I tell myself that I’m no longer addicted, that one with a drink would be fine! I’ve done so well, I deserve a reward. 

I’m not entirely sure why I’m even posting. I know that the only solution is to resist the nicotine fairy on my shoulder. But I don’t want to resist!

Trick for quitting smoking. Quit something else too.

I quit three things at once. Smoking, drinking, and porn. Subscribed to each of the three worthy subreddits. For some this would needlessly complicate things, but I have had stretches of success with each, and feel confident I can manage it. 

Multiple quits are working to my advantage. I usually struggle harder with smoking and drinking but this time around I find porn to be the greater challenge. Point of the day ... my mental attention is distracted on  quitting porn, and I just don't have any attention left to obsess about smoking or drinking. Days are clicking by that I have not smoked, and each day further is progress. 

As the old saying goes, don't let the left hand know what the right hand is doing. Hmm. Wrong metaphor in this context? :p

fucked up.

i just can't do it. i had all the support in the world this time from my amazing new gf who even bought me an e-cig. but then i hung out with friends after work and smoked a blunt, took some xanax to help with the anxiety, but i just didn't care after that, I wanted a cigarette so bad, I've been feigning for it.

i feel like such a failure it is beyond belief. I haven't even told my gf, she was really rooting and proud of me.

edit: on top of that, i went for my first run in MONTHS yesterday. it felt so fantastic being almost 3 days clean and wanting to run. I still feel sore, it feels fantastic. I feel like i ruined everything.

I forced myself to smoke that last cigarette

And I did not enjoy it one bit. I relapsed. I had beers with my one smoking friend. Relented, and purchased a pack on Sunday. I felt ashamed. I have never felt more ashamed in my life. So I told myself I would quit after this pack. My coworker said that is just an excuse. I was going to save half for tomorrow morning but decided to smoke it all right there and then.

But you know what Quittit? I have never felt more disgusted by a cigarette in my life.

I have to reset the counter, but I shall see it hit 30 days this time.

Random moment of being an addict: years later.

Last week I had a tough time. Some work issues and I'd recently started a diet that left me with significantly less carbs and sugar.

I think I was withdrawing from some food-related chemical but I just started panicking and went crazy trying to find my partner's e-cigarette because I suddenly NEEDED a nicotine fix. I even looked at some of my partners regular cigarettes (which are more abhorrent to me because I sing) a couple times.

I wound up trashing several shelves/book-cases/drawers, pulling everything out from under the bed. I was a friggin stone-cold addict for a good two hours.

Somewhere in the back of my head some little voice told me that I was going to feel very good about myself if I got through this without smoking, but it was a comparatively quiet voice to the suddenly awoken giant-nicotine-troll screaming in my ear.

I didn't have a smoke or an e-cig. I made it through, but I was lucky because it was partly because I couldn't find the e-cigs. I felt guilty after about acting like I was detoxing off meth or something, but I did feel wonderful too. I feel like that nicotine-troll was just waiting for a moment of weakness in order to stage a final assault, and I proved that I didn't have to give into that even when I was feeling very low. 

I now have really concrete evidence that I can survive other struggles without turning to cigarettes, and that makes me feel less like an addict than I have since I quit.

Think about this the next time you have a craving, there is a reward for not giving up your agency to the troll, and that reward is feeling powerful and peaceful.

*best.

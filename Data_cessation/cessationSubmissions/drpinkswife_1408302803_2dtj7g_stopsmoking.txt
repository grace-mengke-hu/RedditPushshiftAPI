Something Cool Happened Today...at least I choose to look at it that way.

So back to Day 30. Complete emotional meltdown and I wanted to smoke so bad. Instead I ate  1/2 a giant bag of Doritos.

Fast forward to today. Had another emotional meltdown (life is stressful!)...I never once thought I want to smoke. I thought 'I don't want to feel this way', 'I need to calm down' and 'I hate feeling this way', but I never considered smoking.

And I didn't eat any Doritos...I went running today. I'd like to say I went running and the world got better but I actually went running before the meltdown. 

So it gets better! And I'm calm now and everything did get better and I got stuff done today. That's how I got out of my funk...I got stuff done.

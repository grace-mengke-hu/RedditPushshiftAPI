Hey. I’m new here, show me around. Grace me with your knowledge and advice

Hello everyone. I am 23 years old, 4’11 and 110 pounds. I want to stop smoking cigarettes. Never really focused or cared for quitting at any point in my life, I’ve been smoking since age 15. When I was 17 I had early stage cervical cancer, luckily it was early enough that it could be removed with surgery. My doctors have always been optimistic, saying that I’m young and that my body will heal itself. Not too many complaints concerning smoking, but this infection keeps coming back to due, I’m sure, the inflammation that smoking causes. In addition, I’m also taking adderall daily, it has increased my nicotine cravings immensely. I’ve noticed more and more problems with my health everyday. Occasional chest pains, fatigue, my skin is becoming awful. I take the pill as well and have been getting a shooting pain in my left side which I’m concerned may be a blood clot. I want to stop, but the nicotine withdrawals for me are so intense, I get light headed, I can’t think straight, headache, nausea, and become inconsolably irritable. I really want to stop smoking. With how small I’m built I’m worried about how much more my poor heart can take. But my biggest obstacle right now is coping with withdrawals while I’m at work and under stress for 6 hours straight before a break, and resisting the temptation to go outside to chain smoke in order to feel better for the remaining 4 hours I’m there. I have no self control over this and I have no clue where to start. All of the people I know that I’ve talked to have said that they have been able to quit cold turkey, which just won’t work for me given my terrible withdrawal symptoms after I attempted it. I was hoping someone out there would have any advice or tips that has been through a similar situation. I smoke about 8-12 a day, even if I can cut back for the time being. Thank you

Trouble breaking associations

Just for some insight smokes the past 7 years pack a day and im using chantix.  I really have no issue with the withdrawal symptoms i just really have a hard time not wanting to in the instances that i normally do.  For example i always smoked when driving so it isn't the headache or the craving that makes me want one i didn't smoke all day thursday and didn't have one headache or craving it's more so just not having anything to do with my hands and mouth.

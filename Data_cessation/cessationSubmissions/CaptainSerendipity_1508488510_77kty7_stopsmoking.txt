Two months in and it happened. I finally forgot for a day that I used to be a smoker

I've been waiting for this day. The day where I forgot that I was a smoker and that I did not have a craving or even a conscious idea that I wanted a cigarette for at least a day or 24 hours. I think it must have happened somewhere this week. I had been wondering whether, when and if that day would ever come. Everyone's experience will be different, but for me, someone who smoked for 20 years, pack a day, and quit cold turkey 65 days ago, that day has arrived and I couldn't be happier. 

Just wanted to share that here since I feel it's quite an accomplishment and it's something I was very curious about two months ago. In my experience those 3 to 4 first days are the hardest. You fight those cravings physically and mentally, you fight your own mind and habits, it's hard, but doable. The next two weeks are less hard, but not necessarily easy: you're fighting the mental addiction now and need to retrain  your own brain. You're still fighting it, but know you can do it and it's getting easier every day. And it keeps on getting easier afterwards. You conquer a few heavy trigger moments: drinking with your friends, bad day at work, etcetera. It goes from "fighting it" to "easily subdueing it" to "hm, I guess I just thought about wanting a cigarette now, that's been a while". 

I wish I would have stopped earlier. And I wanted to share the fact that it gets easier every day. So all you new quitters: congrats! Older quitters: congrats! And on-the-fence readers: you can do it. The only regret you'll have is that you will not have quit sooner.

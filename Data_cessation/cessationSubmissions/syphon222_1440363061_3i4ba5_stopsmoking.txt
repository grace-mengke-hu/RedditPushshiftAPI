The fight to not smoke while drinking

Since I've quit I have been replacing my urges to smoke by doing positive things like exercising or focusing on a new task. But I know that when I go out drinking its going to be so hard to fight not wanting to buy a pack or ask for one, has anyone got any tips that they picked up to get past this?

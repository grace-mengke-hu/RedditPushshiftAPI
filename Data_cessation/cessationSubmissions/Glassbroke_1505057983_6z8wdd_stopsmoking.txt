1 year smoke free!

So it is possible and honestly after a couple weeks pretty easy. Urges were there, yet they were the that will chase all of us. I can go out with friends and drink and not even have a hammered temptation. My fiance has been so fucking supportive and we used the 4000$ saved for our wedding.

Thanks for being an awesome community and you all definitely helped.

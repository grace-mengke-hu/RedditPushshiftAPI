Over 10 days

I've been a smoker for 15 years and am now on day 11 of not smoking and I feel great.  I went with the Allen Carr method and it is working great.  For anyone having trouble I would definitely recommend it.  

I've tried every method from willpower to gum to electronic cigs and this is the first time since I've started trying to quit (10 years ago) that I've been okay with it.  My girlfriend still smokes and I can go outside and stand beside her without giving in to the urge to smoke.

"Just one more" means "Just one more year"

So today is Dec 31st, tomorrow is the start of 2016. I remember being here exactly one year ago attempting to smoke my last one ever. And now it makes me sick to think that a whole another year has passed and I smoked all the way through it. I continually had the thought process of "just one more pack, just one more pack". And guess what, I realized that "just one more pack" actually means just one more year. There is no such thing as just one more. I recently just read a quote I really like: "Are you ready to make a big plan? It's entirely up to you. But the only time you can do it is right now. Why now? Because it's always now, silly. If you make a decision to quit tomorrow, it will still be "now", only "then". And you can keep coming back to the problem, forever." So hopefully I will see a lot of other people follow through on their new years resolutions to stop smoking and not fall into the trap of "just one more". I will never smoke again, and I will never change my mind.

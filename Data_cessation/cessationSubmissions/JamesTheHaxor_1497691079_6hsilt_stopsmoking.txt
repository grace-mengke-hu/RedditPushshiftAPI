I did a week, but day 8 is hard! Any advice?

I've got through 7 days. I am happy about that.

I am really struggling today (day 8). I will not give into these cravings but I just need some ideas on how to get through difficult days.

Mentally I am an agitated mess. My temper is short. I feel angry at everything and anything. Zero motivation. I don't even want to get out of bed today.

To make it worse there's 4 screaming kids running around the house all weekend (got family over).

Any advice would be much appreciated.

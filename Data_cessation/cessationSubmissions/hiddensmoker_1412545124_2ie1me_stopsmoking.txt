Not Smoking but, eating more

I'm now on day 5 of not smoking. I am finding the evenings when I am home alone not doing much the hardest part. I'm getting cravings but, also noticed I am managing to get rid of them with a new distraction.. eating. I am already very weight conscious and do not want to replace one distraction with another. Has anyone got any tips to help prevent me from smoking again as, I am currently worried (however stupid I am aware it is) that I would end up smoking over becoming fat.

How bad does 1 cigarette affects you?

Currently on a 2 days streak but I relapsed, but I relapsed by taking one cigarette from someone. I honestly feel a bit better after taking it, but I feel like something is wrong tho. How bad is it relapsing with one cigarette if you don’t really intend to make this a habit ? I don’t feel triggered to buy a new pack as I’m done with smoking, but the question is still here. How affected is your well-being and health if you occasionally take 1 cigarette ?

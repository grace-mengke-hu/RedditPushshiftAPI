Tonight may just be my first real test

I have done surprisingly well cravings wise far the past 11 days with my usual triggers - I've been able to be at a pub with smokers, be able to handle stress levels both work and family in nature, be around my SO (who is still smoking) and survived a weekend without too much effort. 

Tonight is the first night I think I will truly be challenged with the group of people im  going to be around, this group of friends have almost kept my fuel for cigarettes alive this long.

While I feel confident and I feel like this will be easier than I anticipate, hoping you guys can wish me strength!

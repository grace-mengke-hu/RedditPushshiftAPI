Just Spent S450! And it felt GREAT!

I'm smoke-free and alcohol-free for 35 days when I wake up. I have a shit job in a grocery store. The direct savings amount to over $1,100 per month and 25k calories. I've celebrated my sobriety and cigarette-free life with really nice dinners I make at home and a few out. Fasting intermittently, walking an average of 6 miles daily with 2.5 or 5 lb./leg ankle weights, and no drunken food binges...my shorts feel comfortable.

I have a new Osprey backpack, a new Patagonia rain-proof shell, new Native sunglasses, and a new t-shirt from REI...i probably have saved a couple hundred bucks, but I've spent the rest of the savings on living better. 

Well, I feel really fantastic at the end of day 34...apps say over 25k in beer calories and 35k in my brisk walks every night. Yeah, I vape for nicotine, so I'm not perfect and don't pretend to be. Nonetheless, I'm changing a lot.

Thank you for your part in this journey...so far, it is unfolding exceptionally well. (By the way, I've been quitting on and off for at least a decade...45 year-old, 25 years smoking, 28 years swaying between a binge drinker and consistent drinker). It just clicked finally, but it wouldn't have clicked unless I was still trying!

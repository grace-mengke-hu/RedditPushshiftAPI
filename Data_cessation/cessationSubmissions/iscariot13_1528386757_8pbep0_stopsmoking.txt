Support and the disappointment cigarette

I've been off cigarettes and nicotine for two weeks. 

I just wanted to say two things. 

One. I'm really appreciative of the community here. Your support helped me power through. I read Allen Carr to quit and one of the things he focuses on is the importance in 'rejoicing' in the quit. It's difficult to always get that positivity from smoking or non-smoking friends IRL. 
 
The second is realizing that if i succumbed to the draw of the next cigarette, it would be filled with nothing but disappointment. I would be so pissed off with myself for being a sucker and ruining the whole quit effort. But what would be the real kicker is smoking that next cigarette and realising that it does FUCK ALL.

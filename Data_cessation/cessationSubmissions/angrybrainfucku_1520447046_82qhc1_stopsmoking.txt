You can't quit it. Because you don't want to. Accept it or not! You smoke it because you want to keep yourself smoking it for the rest of your life. Accept it or not!



I don't pronounce that filthy shit. I don't have anything to do with that filthy shit. I don't even count the day since when I quitted that filthy shit. When I face a craving I just swear so much and kick and punch in the air furiously like a crazy person. Than I make myself calm and collected , look in the mirror complementing myself like"you are a fucking amazing human " and "congratulations for being able to realize that you are no longer a self harmer". Then I get back to my work.


I don't know when I quitted. And I don't have to. All I have to know that now I'm a non self harmer. I have occasional cravings that just makes me remind that one fine day I will wake up finish my day and go to sleep and would repeat the cycle of day and night while occasionally having the thought of "I don't know why did I take so long to quit it".

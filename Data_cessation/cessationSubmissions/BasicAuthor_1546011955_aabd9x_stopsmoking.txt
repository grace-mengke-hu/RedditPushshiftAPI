Karma

I've quit on and off, most successfully for 6 months which was awesome. Quit again about a week ago pretty successfully, but my husband still does. This morning he left a pack open on the dining room table and I couldn't help it, I grabbed it before I left for work. Didn't smoke it on the way, but about two hours after getting to work I was like "okay I'm doing it." It's raining here, so I went outside under a bridge-type thing. Lit it, took one puff, giant rain drop landed in the middle and soaked it. Tried to dry it with the lighter flame, broke it in that spot. Tried to hold it together, completely disintegrated. Threw it out. Karma.

Somebody did offer me a new one but I said, "nah, that's exactly what was supposed to happen."

Still craving everyday...

First time poster here. I stopped smoking 2.5 months ago. Seems like the last two weeks I’ve kind of lost the initial excitement over the milestones I was hitting... and I find myself kind of ‘missing’ my old life. When I stopped smoking, I also stopped drinking (as much- I still have a few beers), started exercising almost everyday and eating super healthily. I’ve recently started to miss the old me- missing the mid week booze nights with wine and packet of cigs with friends. Going drinking doesn’t feel good anymore- I have to wake up to workout (which I enjoy), or alcohol puts me over my daily calories etc., 

What I’m saying is I just miss my bad habits haha, maybe I had more fun then.  I still crave cigarettes, but not in the same way- it feels as though my brain is looking to ‘indulge’ in a certain way, or I kind of want to pine away with a cig if I’m making sense.  

This just came about the past 2 weeks or so- I was not craving nearly half as bad before. It seems as though everyone here is finding it easier day after day, not harder... is it just me? 

In a bid to have more fun- I’m going skydiving tomorrow. Wish me luck!

Thanks for reading.

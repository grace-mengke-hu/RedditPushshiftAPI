Ok. Day 1. Here goes. "I'm a non-smoker"

Hi all, this is about my 20th attempt to stop.  39 years old, been smoking since 18.  2 young kids now, sick of the way my mouth feels when i wake up, sick of feeling like a failure every time i fail to quit, sick of the guilt of the money i could be putting to better things, sick of the thought of not being there for my boys and wife if something bad was to happen to me through smoking, and idly dismissing it.  I'm strong, I am, but i've never beaten this.  Time to put this demon to bed.  I'm a non smoker. Lets do this.

Got plenty snacks, trying to do my day differently, planning in extra exercise, and rewards for myself.  Signed up here, going to read some other inspirational quitters stories on here (thanks all for sharing! It definitely helps, helped me in one of my previous attempts that got me off for 6 months - need to learn how to maintain)... trickiest part of day 1 will be, tonight is a friends birthday and heading to pub later for couple drinks.  None of them are smokers though, so it's not a bad crowd, i would be the only one usually... thinking may stay off the beer, again for a point of difference, and go with a fizzy drink.  Will let you know how i go on tomorrow..

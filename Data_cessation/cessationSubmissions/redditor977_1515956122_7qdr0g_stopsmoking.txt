High-stress environment and quitting

Hi guys, I am going through a very stressful phase in my life which is probably going to last for about 2 weeks. I am usually a very good applicator of healthy stress management skills but this time I feel like I have been caught off-guard and I’m feeling so vulnerable. All I think about is smoking and my brain keeps telling me that quitting is just not for now and must be postponed. I know this is a lie but I cannot seem to gain control of myself. I haven’t relapsed yet, I have been smoke free for 5 months + 8 days. What do I do? Thanks in advance.

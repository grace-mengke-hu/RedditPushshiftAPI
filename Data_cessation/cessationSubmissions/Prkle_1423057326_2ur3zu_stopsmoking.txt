First day after almost 10 years of smoking.

Hey all, I've been smoking since I was 15 and am turning 25 this year. I've had these thoughts for a while but then I read Allen Carr's book and it was just the nudge I needed in the right direction to quit. I'm experiencing some symtoms of restlessness and a sort of "empty feeling". Like hunger. But I've been prepared for those. I get automatic thoughts during the day about wanting a cig, but I know that's just the little nicotine monster trying to trick me. All in all, today *could* have been worse. I don't know, sort of expecting all hell to break loose any minute now instead of being happy about it. Oh well, all in due time I guess.

Thanks for reading!

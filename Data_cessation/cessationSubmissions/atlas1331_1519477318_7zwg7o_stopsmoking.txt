One week nicotine free !

Hi guys, I’ve been lurking for quite awhile, and wanted to say thanks for so much great advice. I quit a week ago, using the Allen Carr book, and am honestly feeling pretty good. I smoked for a little over ten years, and have tried to quit in the past, but usually didn’t make it even to this point. A lot of times I would end up reducing what I smoked ( and then of course I’d only do that for awhile), which clearly didn’t work. I have a question though : so the first five days or so, I didn’t even think about smoking, even though they were probably the most stressful days I’ve had in years. The last two- ish days though, I desperately wanted to smoke, like tore my house apart looking for a cigarette ( didn’t have any, and refuse to buy any). I immediately felt guilty about wanting the cigarette, but it felt like I couldn’t control myself. Is this normal? Any tips to make sure I don’t go on a rampage rummage again?

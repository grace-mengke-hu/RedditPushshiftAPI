Day 16 - Done!!

Totally delighted with me !!!  Day 16 done - £100 richer - 250 cigarettes not smoked!!!!!  BUT the big thing I want to say is that it's taken a lot of efforts to get this far and every time I've relapsed, the next attempt has been easier as you learn when your moments of weakness are.  And yep, they're not catching me out this time !!! 👍

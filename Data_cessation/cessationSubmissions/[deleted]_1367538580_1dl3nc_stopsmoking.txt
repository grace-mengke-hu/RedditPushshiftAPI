Two months and one week, I feel amazing.

I feel like I finally got past the hard part. My advice is to remove yourself from temptation as much as possible. I never go near people smoking anymore and I threw away all my lighters and ashtrays. This is my third attempt to quit, and I know for sure that if I slip and have just one, I'll be back to smoking in no time.

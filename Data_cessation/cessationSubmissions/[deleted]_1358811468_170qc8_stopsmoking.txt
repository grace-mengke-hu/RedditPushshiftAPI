I cracked. 21 days in, just had a cigarette to ease constipation - help me 

Hello everyone, apologies in advance, this is TMI. 

I have seen that constipation when giving up smoking is a common side effect but how have you guys managed to overcome it?

I gave up on new years day, cold turkey & had been doing OK with the cravings, mood swings etc... The one thing I cannot cope with is the constipation. I am a fit & active individual, I am a 24 year old female, been smoking since I was 16. 

I am a very weight conscious person & knew that I would perhaps put on a little, what I did not expect was 3 kilos in as many weeks. I feel huge, I look 5 months pregnant & am beyond bloated. I have been in the gym 6 days a week which is normal for me. I have increased my fibre intake, started taking probiotics, magnesium, ginger root, fennel seed, laxatives, stool softeners, anything but nothing seems to work. 

I cracked & just went & bought a packet of cigarettes & smoked 2 straight off the bat. My head feels awful but I can immediately feel an urge to go to the toilet & myself almost de-bloating.

Please tell me anyone, how did you get over the constipation, this is the only thing stopping me.

Thank you in advance.

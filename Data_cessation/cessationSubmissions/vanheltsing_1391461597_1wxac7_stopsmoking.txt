Zero hour

I had half a pack early this morning, now it's gone. I even gave out the last cigar to a colleague and my precious... the lighter. 

I will turn 30 on saturday. I have smoked for the most part of my life now. I have tried at least 3 times to quit it. Maybe this time is not a special one and I will bounce down, maybe one puff, just one cigar. However, I want to quit... I really want to quit.

I truly despise smoking. It's the only thing that get me to my knees and makes me beg. I'm a slave, I'm miserable... I'm an idiot and a fool but maybe that was the last one. Maybe...

I'll keep posting, just to remember myself that this must be the one... I'm here to claim my freedom!

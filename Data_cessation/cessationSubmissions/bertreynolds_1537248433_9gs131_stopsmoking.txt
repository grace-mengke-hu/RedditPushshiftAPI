Feeling pretty foolish.

I first started smoking cigarettes when I was in college and should have known better. I was 19. I smoked about a pack of Camel lights, and later, regular Camel menthols a day until I was 26. I, like many of us, had tried quitting so many times before. But what finally did it for me was buying an entire carton of shitty cigarettes from a native American reservation. They were just awful, so much more awful than any other cigarette I had ever tried. What added to the decision to quit was the fact that I had just bought an entire carton. Up until that point I was just buying packs, but when I had all 200 cigarettes sitting in front of me in a box, I felt so ashamed of myself. My grandmother and grandfather were both smokers and it killed them. How could I be doing this to myself? I quit cold turkey and soon was repulsed by the thought of smoking.

Fast forward four years. My girlfriend is out of town for a couple of months on an extended business trip. I made the horrible decision to buy a pack of cigarettes just to see what I was missing out on. What a terrible mistake. That first pack had me hooked again, and 16 packs later, I've got to quit all over again. I've tried all different brands this time around. They all suck. It's amazing how quickly cigarettes make you feel like shit. I went for a hike last weekend, and wow what a difference.

I just smoked the last of my most recent pack, and I won't be buying any more. Once again, I am a non-smoker. At least this time I know what to expect.

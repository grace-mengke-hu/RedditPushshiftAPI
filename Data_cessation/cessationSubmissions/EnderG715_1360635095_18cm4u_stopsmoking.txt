72 Hours Smoke Free

With a child on the way I need to not be so selfish about my health and understand that there are bigger things out there. The cravings haven't been so bad, the first 24 hours were really brutal.  It almost feels like i have gone around the bend and things are finally looking up.  For the past couple of months I have been planning to quit before my child is born and I finally made the decision that the time is right. I have been smoking for over 12 years and when my child is 40 years old I don't want him to wonder why I am not there.

I have attempted to quit numerous times before but I wanted to share what has worked for me.  I first started rolling my own cigs using 100% natural tobacco.  I discover that the manufactured cigs with all the chemicals and preservatives are addictive in themselves. When I got my smoking down to 2-4 cigs a day I decided to stop. I tried everything, chantix, gum, patches, ecigs and nothing worked until I started rolling my own, saved me a good amount of money while I was at it.

TL;DR: Got a baby on he way in 2 months, Quit cold turkey 72 hours ago, rolled my own cigs to reduce how much I smoked. Things are looking up.

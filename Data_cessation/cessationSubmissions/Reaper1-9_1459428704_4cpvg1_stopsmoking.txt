Day -1 and I'm already a nervous wreck.

I have been a pack-a-day smoker for about 10 years and recently decided that it's time. I set April 1st as my quit date. 

I suffer on and off with anxiety and smoking has always been my go-to for calming myself down when I'm having a rough time. I know that once I get over the hump I'll be so glad I did it, but I'm worried about this initial period of misery. Nausea, anxiety, depression, insomnia, loss of concentration. I know these are all very, very small prices to pay for improved health and potentially longer life, but the nausea worries me because that's one of my main anxiety symptoms, the insomnia and loss and concentration worry me because I'm a student and we're coming up on finals, etc. 
Is there anything I can do to get through this period more smoothly? I've tried and failed at quitting over and over and I really want this time to be different.

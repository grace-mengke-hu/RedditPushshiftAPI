I can't smoke untill Monday and need some advice to help me refrain from buying a pack on payday!

Title - I haven't had a smoke in 24 hours and I can't say it's getting any easier, im counting the hours to payday so I can go buy a pack. I want to take this opportunity to quit though and I'm wondering if anyone has any advice to help me NOT buy those cancersticks coming Monday.

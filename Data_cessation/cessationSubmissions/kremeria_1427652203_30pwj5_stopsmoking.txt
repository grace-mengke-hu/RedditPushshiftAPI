Not sure what to think

So today a co-worker passed me a joint (mixed with tobacco)
I took two puffs out of courtesy, but didn't inhale both while he wasn't looking.

I'm confused now. kinda paranoid about tobacco entering my body, and i hope that it didn't.

Sorry, just needed to get it out of my system.

Thought I was at 4 weeks. Just checked the calendar and I'm at 5 weeks! Holy crap, thank you so much r/stopsmoking. It's badge time!

I'm mostly a lurker, but reading everyone's stories and hearing their little tips and tricks has been such a huge help and source of support. Thank you all, and best of luck on your journeys.

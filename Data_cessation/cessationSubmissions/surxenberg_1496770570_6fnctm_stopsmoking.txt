Quit for 5 years, started again, quit again

I'm a dumb idiot. I smoked for 8 years, then lay off smoking cold turkey for 5 years... was stupid enough to pick it up again at a friend's bachelor party. it's been a year, now i've quit again. I'm on day 4 of my cold turkey, starting to feel better now.


The "never take another puff" meme is real. Once you are addicted, you will remain addicted for the rest of your life. Don't jeopardize it once you made it.

That is all.

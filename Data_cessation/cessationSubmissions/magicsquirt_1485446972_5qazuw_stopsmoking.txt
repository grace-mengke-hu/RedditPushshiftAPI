Stick to your choice

Just stick to it. If you say you're gonna stop smoking, then do what you say! Trust yourself and respect yourself by doing what you say you will do. Motivation will not come to your door one day and say ''Ok, I'm here now so let's do this''. Don't relate on motivation, it comes and goes, you can't trust it. Instead, relate on your choice and make it non-negotiable. 

Be proud of yourself, it's a great feeling.

It's been about 60 hours. Piss easy so far... *flexes*

OK I've got a decent vape and I'm eating more.  
My mind is kind of cloudy. Slightly tense. I think I have less patience at the moment.  Feel sorry for my girlfriend. But at least I won't stink anymore.   
  
I like not feeling that I have to escape for a smoke all the time.

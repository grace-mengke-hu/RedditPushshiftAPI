61 Days and I almost caved.

Last night sucked. I got into an extremely nasty car accident. Fortunately, the only thing damaged was my vehicle and the other person's car...and the deer. I and the other driver made it out without serious injury. While on scene, I reached into my pocket to grab my vape and the part that holds the oil was cracked and oil was leaking everywhere. I was fine for a while, but once the adrenalin wore off, I was in panic attack mode.

A well meaning Fire Fighter offered me a cigarette and I was able to turn it down, but for a few moments, I wanted that cancer stick so badly. 

What's interesting is that, I actually felt better about my quit. I have been offered cigarettes by well meaning co-workers when I go outside on break. I just take the "smoke break" to get outside as smokers are allowed two extra 15 minute breaks during shift as long as we aren't busy and get carte blanche to run outside for a quick smoke any other time. Every time I turn a smoke down, I feel proud of myself. Being able to turn down that smoke last night was huge for me.

Forced to stop for a few days so might as well continue the streak..

Hi everyone. I've been smoking for 26 years and have been at 1.5 packs per day for the last 10 or so. On 5/13/18, I was admitted to the hospital for a perforated ulcer. Luckily I did not need surgery and I was able to come home today. Needless to say, I couldn't smoke while I was in there and am close to the 72-hour mark now that I'm home.

I've been saying for years that I'm going to quit so I figure why not now? Luckily for me, I've been making some other changes in my life lately so I have read up on how to change habits, to relax/meditate, and set daily goals. 

I feel like I'm really going to do it this time. Wish me luck please! And I'm sending good vibes to everyone out there struggling. :)

I didn't believe I will ever quit, now I don't really remember that I smoked!

Hey guys, just wanted to give you some motivation! Quitting was like hell to me (especially the first month). I thought I would never be fully 'normal' fully a 'never smoker'. Well guess what? I don't really think about it anymore at all. I randomly remembered by browsing reddit... So... No excuses, kick that nasty habit and have a great life!
I though this is not possible, but it is very possible. Wow 660 days... Who would have thought! :-)

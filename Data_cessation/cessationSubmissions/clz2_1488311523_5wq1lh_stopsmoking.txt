One month

In 2016 I smoked very lightly. I might have a cigarette or two then not have one for months. Early this year a bought a pack and smoked through most of it. I decided this had to stop. I have never been addicted, and I don't want that to happen. I knew if I didn't stop that is probably what would happen. I had to quit while I was ahead. Anyway, it is now a month since I have had one. I thought I might as well post here. I am very thankful to be stopping now, I know it could definitely get out of hand quickly if I didn't and then quitting would be much harder. I am very lucky.

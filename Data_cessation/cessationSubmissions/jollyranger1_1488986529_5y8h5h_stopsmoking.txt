4 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes.

I am terrible at asking for help. I decided to quit smoking on a bit of a whim and I am loving it. Don't get me wrong, this process sucks (I've now quit 5 times in 12 years) but there is nothing like taking a deep uninhibited breath of morning spring air. I also love how my workouts these last few days have improved and I've even started running again since I can now breath under pressure. With all of the great perks that come with quitting, I need some help to hold onto it. You see, St. Patty's is this weekend and so is my best friends birthday. I need help/advice on how to resist the craving while drinking, or do I avoid it all together? Does just one cig ever actually work (I'm guessing not since this is my 5th time quitting...) We both just started new jobs as well, so we are stoked to celebrate. Can that involve a few cigs over the weekend? Has anyone succeeded in going from a chain smoker to a social smoker? 

Thanks and love and peace.

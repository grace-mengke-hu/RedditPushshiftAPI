I’m doing what’s right for me. I can’t be perfect straight away. I will do this eventually.

I started smoking at the young age of 13,I suffered with disordered eating and heard that smoking was an appetite suppressant. I developed many other addictive habits along my adolescence,sex,self harm,allowing myself to be hurt by partners. 

I don’t allow men to abuse me anymore,I’m stronger now. I don’t use sex to feel something other than pain anymore,I know what I’m worth. I’m almost 3 years clean of self harm,a blade will never touch my skin again.  

But smoking? It’s the only vice I have left. I’m scared,I’m so fucking scared. However I’m also scared of the pain I feel in my lungs,I’m scared of how I’ve already permanently ruined my young body. 

I know one day I will quit forever,I’ve overcome so much already at only 20. I’m not ready to stop this altogether,I don’t have the strength just yet but I’m trying. 

I know it’s not the perfect remedy but going from 30+ cigarettes a day to an e-cigarette is tiny progress. I will reduce the amount of nicotine every 2 or 3 months till I reach the point of none.  Until I decide I’m ready altogether. 

Nicotine is so addictive,but so is the actual action of smoking. If I’ve learned anything from other addictions I’ve over come it’s that you won’t quit till you’re ready and deep down I know I’m not ready. I’m trying though and I’m going to try so god damn hard. 

It’s not the perfect most healthy solution but it’s something. I’m proud I’m starting this long journey. I will do this.

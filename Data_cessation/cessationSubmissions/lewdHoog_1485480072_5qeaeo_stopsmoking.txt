Did anyone else have a really tough time when lowering nicotine patch strength?

What's good ya'll?! I'm thirty days into my quit, and yesterday was by far the worst of it. It was my second day on Step 2 of the patch program (went from 21MG to 14MG) and it was horrible. Anxiety, restlessness, stomach issues, headaches, and irritability were through the roof.

Did anyone else have a similar experience? Today has been MUCH better, but I'm still shook up a bit.

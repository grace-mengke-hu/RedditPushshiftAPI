26 days, gone.

Can't believe I made it this far and ****ed it up again.

I just got depressed as hell, my GF and I broke up, I had my xanax with me and kept popping bars, so my inhibition went lower, I even smoked a bit of weed (which I haven't done either in a while) and then ended up needing that first "stress only" cigarette.

My GF came over that night and had a pack too. She said they were her stress cigarettes and I found it ironic. However she quit after that night, until today I convinced her to get one more pack, to let me quit on my terms, which is to smoke right before bed, usually after I smoke a bowl. It works in the past, and I've found if I do it correctly and remove all smoking paraphnelia in the morning and read comics at work or something entertaining to distract me then I will not worry about cigarettes.

Just sucks getting so far and then failing. Does this mean I shouldn't smoke pot? I find pot + ciggs the perfect combo, I can't do one without the other, it seems.

Wow! Is that how my lungs are supposed to work?

So, nearly 2 weeks since my last cigarette, and I decided today was the perfect day (this is a stretch, really because it was hotter than hades on a tuesday) to test out how my breathing has improved. Had a free drink from Starbucks for my birthday, and Starbucks is about 3/4 of a mile or so from my house. So, loaded up the toddler in the stroller and the spouse and I walked to the caffeination station. Now, usually, about 3 blocks into this trek, i am having to stop and coughing and hacking and so clogged up with mucous that I cannot breathe and am near being violently ill.
Today, all the way to Starbucks, all the way back, and the only issue I had was that my hands were frozen from the 2 Frappucinos in my hands (I had to carry hubby's so he could steer the toddler) and I was a little sweaty and overheated. And on top of that, as we were leaving the establishment, there was a man smoking a cigarette standing right outside and the thing stunk!!!! I feel good today. How is everyone else doing?

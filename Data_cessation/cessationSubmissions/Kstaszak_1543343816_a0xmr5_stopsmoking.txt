Day 8

My stomach is actually rumbling cuz I'm hungry.... I used to go all day without eatting before that happened when I smoked.  After looking it up I found that when we smoke, nicotine sends a chemical message that makes the liver break down sugar that is in storage for use. Which is how we can go all day without eatting and be fine.  Now that we have quit, that's not the case anymore, and we have to eat more frequently.

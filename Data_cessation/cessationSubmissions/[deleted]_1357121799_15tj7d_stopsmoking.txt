Today is day 1

I found this subreddit yesterday while I was panicking about the impending doom of how i would feel after my last smoke. I knew it wasn't going to be easy, but thought that if I was at least reading others going through the same thing, then I wouldn't feel as bad. 
It was the best thing I ever did, I read "the book". Never did I think I would wake up this morning not wanting to smoke but be happy that I'm an ending the evil monsters reign on my life! 
So the hardest part of my smoking day is now over... Lets see how I handle a meal :)  
Good luck to everyone who is trying, I feel very positive this time.

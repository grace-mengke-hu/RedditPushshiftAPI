1 Week and Counting

After the first three days I felt great, my energy and focus levels have definitely increased, my taste seems to be slightly better too. The last 48 hours have been rough though, the thoughts about cigarettes have been pretty constant, I'm hoping it's just because I'm still breaking the association of smoking with all my other activities, I'd be sad if this feeling lasts the rest of my life

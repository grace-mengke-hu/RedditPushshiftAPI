Does life get less depressing?

I'm currently trying my very best to quit, and it is so hard. I'm up to day 5 after failing a 10 day streak. The thing that makes it so hard is how much less enjoyable life is without smoking.
Bad day at work?... smoke, and happiness is yours again.
Just had a shit night out?... smoke Happiness is yours again.
Day off?.. Darts all day out the back in the sun, ultimate relaxation.

I don't know if its just that I need to replace the habit with something else but It's starting to become really hard to justify living a longer life with less enjoyment in it due to the fact that I don't smoke. Especially if these hardcore cravings continue, because they are extremely unpleasent and cigarettes are always on my mind!

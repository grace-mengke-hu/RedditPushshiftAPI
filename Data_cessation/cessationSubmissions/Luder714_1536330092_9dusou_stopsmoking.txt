Over 1 month smoke free: A Rant--WARNING: Debbie Downer rant following. Do not read if you are Struggling ATM!! I Don't Want to Bring you Down to My Level!


I was a pack a day+ smoker since I was about 15.  I am 50 now.  I cut down to 2 packs over 2 weeks before I put them down for good.  I just passed 4 weeks and think about smoking 20-30 times a day.  They pass quickly though.

Whenever I smell a cig I can pinpoint where it is coming from immediately.  "Three cars up and one lane over"  I guess my sense of smell is better :)  I have even debated picking up a half finished cig off of the ground.  Several times.

The one thing I have going for me is that I am cheap, so I can go into a gas station without buying them.

I have destroyed several packages of pens by chewing on them,.  I have been through hundreds of pieces of gum.  I chew on cinnamon sticks, straws, etc.  I now dream of smoking nightly.

I now hate being social because I just want to smoke.  It's almost like I resent or am jealous of friends because they are happy, if that makes any sense.  Add alcohol into it and it is 10 times as hard, so I stopped drinking.  I am short with my family and am generally a grumpy old man all of the time.  I have become a boring stick in the mud.  I try to talk to people as little as possible because my usual reply is mean or nasty.  I am getting better at censoring myself, but it can be difficult.  Although it was ultimately my choice to quit,  with my family and friends supporting me a lot, I find myself resenting them all.

I reflect on it and think that it is my subconscious acting this way in order to get "permission" to smoke.

I am hoping that this will change eventually, but I fear that smoking was my way of self medicating the fact that I am indeed a boring, bitter person inside, and I have been covering it up for years.

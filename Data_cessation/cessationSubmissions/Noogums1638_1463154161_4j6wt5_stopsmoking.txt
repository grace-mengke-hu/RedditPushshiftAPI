Third Week Woes

Coming up on the end of Week 3 as a non smoker and it's been really stressful, but I feel like today is the worst.  I've been using the patch and have found these first 3 weeks easier than any other attempt at quitting.  However today I was in a rush to get to work and forgot to put a patch on.  Lots of anxiety today, almost some tears, and I'm not even half way through the work day.  This is going to take more strength than I have.  Just have to keep telling myself why I'm doing this in the first place.

Will smoking weed with tobacco in it make my cravibgs come back?

So i quit smoking just a few days ago an had had cravibgs but they seen to start decreasing now, but i’ve always liked smoking weed and i won’t quit that as it’s actually fun and not as bad for your health, but now i’m not sure if i can still smoke joints with weed and tobacco anymore because it might cause the nicotine cravings to come back. Does anyone have any answers for this? Can i just smoke weed with tobacco because you’re doing it for the weed anyway or should i really watch out with putting tobacco in it?

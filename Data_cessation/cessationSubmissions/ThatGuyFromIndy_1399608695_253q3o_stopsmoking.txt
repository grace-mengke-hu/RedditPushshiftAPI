Giving this a shot and already struggling...

I had posted earlier about whether I should try to quit during finals...well,  finals are over. It's been just past a true 24 hours, and I am definitely feeling an urge to smoke -- very surprisingly (based on past efforts), it hasn't been that bad until now. I'm not tired, and I'm making a list of stuff to do but I feel like I need to smoke in order to get started...

I'm also trying to give no-fap a serious effort now, so fighting on multiple fronts.

Just venting.

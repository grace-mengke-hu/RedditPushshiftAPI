My Worst Withdrawal Ever

So, at 29 years old this is my tenth attempt at quitting smoking. I made it to one month previously and to six months the time before that but I always failed. This time I’m more committed to quitting because I have a reason beyond myself to quit.
I’m now on day 4 of my current attempt but this time is much different to any of the other attempts because I’m going cold turkey. I have had zero cravings for tobacco, which I normally have around this time, but the most intense withdrawal symptoms ever. Pull a withdrawal symptom out of a hat and I’m suffering from it. The nausea and the anxiety are new symptoms for me and they are killing me. If I didn’t have bills to pay I doubt I would even have gone to work the symptoms are that bad. Thankfully, I have my therapist appointment tomorrow but tomorrow is still a whole 24 hours way.
Has anyone else experienced withdrawal symptoms this severe after multiple failed attempts? I know I’m not alone in this but I still need to get it out there because this is the worst kind of torture.

5 weeks, 3 days without...

I want a cigarette so badly. I have not figured out how to manage my stress and sadness or any other negative emotion so when they arise....I find myself almost in tears because I want a cigarette. One puff and im sure it would clear my mind. I really need to work on negative emotions..

Gave in, giving it another go!

So last time I stopped, I still enjoyed cigs I just wanted to see if I was addicted or not. I managed to stay clean for 3 months until life got busy again and I started smoking again. Was 1 pack a week and then recently became way more than that the more and more I got "stressed". It just became a habit eventually.  

Long story short, am trying again. Been about 5 days now and am very positive I can do it. I don't even remember enjoying my last cig so hopefully this time I won't be stupid enough to trick myself into accepting a craving. 

Good luck, everyone! Just wanted to share because I felt proud for trying again :D

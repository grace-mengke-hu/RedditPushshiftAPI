Random Cravings

This week i've had numerous cravings. It's so weird. I've had to tell cigarette butts in public ashtrays "NO!" I'm sure i've looked weird while doing that. Oh well. I know i've made the right decision and i'm not gonna bend. Do they ever go away completely? The random cravings?
Cheers

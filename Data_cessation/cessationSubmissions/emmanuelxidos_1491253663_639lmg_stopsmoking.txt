Been thinking of quitting for a few months now but every time I try to quit I always find some way to prolong it a few days

As the title says, I am always prolonging quitting but it has been on my mind a lot lately. I am really desperate to quit after 8 years of smoking but I can't seem to take the final step. 

Any tips on getting past the excuses and actually going for it? I have set my quit date to April 5th. 

Also not really interested in using substitutes at all, after reading Allen Carr's Easy Way. 

Any tips are welcome though, and congrats to everyone here who has stopped or is trying to stop!!!

What have you done to successfully stop the urge?

I'm still trying to quit smoking. I'll go about a day or two until I get the urge and can't seem to find a way, that works for me, to keep them at bay. I know it doesn't get any easier, but what have you done to get past them in the early days of trying to quit?

10 days!

10 days and going strong!

Reading all your stories, I feel kind of bad, actually. It's been easier for me than I thought it would be. But I thought I'd still share my joy and use this space to offer my support to all other quitters. 

Don't think I can consider myself "cured" yet, but yeah, definitely worth it. I had forgotten toothpaste actually tasted something. ;)

Health effects on occasional smoking

I've been smoking for 4 years and now I'm smoking only when drinking or under a lot of stress. I decided to stop when my asthma got worse and I got scared for my health. How bad is it to smoke only now and then? Is it possible to keep smoking only few packs a month or should I try to stop everything at once?

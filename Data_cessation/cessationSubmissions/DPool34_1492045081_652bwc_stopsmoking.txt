Vape shopping: is it best to buy online or go to a local vape shop?

I want to quit smoking via a transition to vaping. I don't plan on vaping long term, at least that's my intention. 

The last time I attempted to quit smoking I used one of those Blu disposable vape pens to minimize the withdrawal and ease the transition. I used the pen for a week or so. I didn't smoke for about 6 months than relapsed back into smoking cigarettes. 

This time I want a better vape device â€”not that it'll improve my chances of not relapsing, it's just that the cheap vape pen didn't "pull" like the more sophisticated ones. 

I have no idea what I'm doing when it comes to vaping. I know you need the device, battery, coils, and the oil. I just don't know where's the best place to shop for them, what brands are best, am I better getting a whole kit or buying the stuff separately? I also value portability (I definitely wouldn't want one of those big devices I see some people using); the closer to a pen-sized device, the better. 

I'd appreciate any advice. Thanks. 

**TL;DR: want to quit smoking with a vape device (will probably use it for a couple months). Looking for inside knowledge on best places/websites to buy, best brands or brands to avoid, buy a package/kit or buy parts separately?**

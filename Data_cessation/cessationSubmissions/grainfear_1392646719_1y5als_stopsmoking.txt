3 days

I quit smoking 3 days ago after my uncle was diagnosed with lung cancer at the age of 56. I'm a heavy hand rolled smoker (13 years, 20-25/day, no filter, they are smaller than normal cigarettes though).

I have a bad history of hypochondria, even was admitted to an asylum for a month because i could not function anymore out of fear of dying. Panic attacks and constant aches everywhere in my body have followed me for over a year after my admission. I got out of it through discipline and will power. This was over 2 years ago, and i've felt extremely happy since.

The news of my uncles disease had everything come crashing down on me. I know i have to quit, i WANT to quit, badly. I haven't touched a cig in 3 days, and my mind is in an extreme struggle every day. Every chest pain is lung cancer. Two moles on my lip i didn't pay attention to over the last few years are lip cancer. My god, i'm gonna die, i NEED a smoke now. Can't go to the doctor, she knows my history and won't take me seriously. Job is killing me, need to finish this super important thing in 2 weeks, or else. I need to find an excuse to smoke, cause i need the smoke to get rid of the fear that it's killing me.

I was hoping to never experience that kind of fear in my life again. But there it is.

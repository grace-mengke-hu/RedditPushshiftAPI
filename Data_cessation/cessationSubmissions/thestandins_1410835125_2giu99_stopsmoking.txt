I can do this.. I think

So I quit smoking weed and drinking alcohol last month as I realized I couldnt handle using either one. Now I hope to get rid of this addiction too, starting tomorrow. Earlier this year I did manage to quit smoking for 2 months until I got drunk one night but it feels like its going to be so hard to get back there. Hopefully I can rid this addiction and work on improving myself and my self esteem :( bleh

Day 1. Again.

So today is my first day of not smoking. again.


On the 15th October 2010, I quit smoking.  I stayed quit. For nearly 3 years.  Then, my wife and I went on a holiday in September last year. I figured, "I can smoke, I have the control to just give it up again when we get back"


Once we got back, I continued smoking for another 8 months and finally decided to quit again in April/May this year.


I lasted just over 4 months.


I took it back up recently, in early September and I don't want to do it any more!


So this is the last time.  The real last time that I will have to quit smoking.  Never again will I think that I can just have one smoke and be done with it.  

I **can** do this.

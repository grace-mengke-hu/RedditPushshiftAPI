I'm being a different person and not neccesarily an asshole.

So I'm nearing day 7 without cigs and day 18 without weed.

My father told me today I would smoke again when I get a stressful job and often tells me I'm gonna be suffering in jobs just like him.. I told him madly today ''What the fuck, I don't tell you you're going to fail with that woman you're going out tomorrow, I don't make bad trips about your future, I don't tell you 100 men are going to fuck her (his new date), why you do it to me whole the time (mostly considering my working life and smoking) '' I mean he's a really good guy and he has taught me a lot and wishes all good things to me, but I finally got nerves to say what I needed though I told him in a nervous matter. Being stoned and smoking cigs just made me suffer and keep shit inside of me.  

But remember prove yourself and all but don't be an asshole :) 

Another thing I've gone through today was this alcoholic guy who is not necessarily stupid but clearly doesn't care about himself much and talks a lot about his cats and dogs and his problems to me.  While I was smoking, usually I would let that guy annoy me for much time because I just thought he was lonely as I am and would just listen to him and waste my time and listen in repeat how his dogs were his life.. This time I just replied '' I quit smoking, my brain is jumping out of my head. I wanna be alone, Bye''(it was more like a lack of sleep) and he told me ''Yeah I did it too, used to smoke a lot'' and he asked me for the time I said I didn't have my cellphone and said ''Bye'' I didn't even said sorry, it was like I was told that I had to say sorry for every fucking single shit thing in my life. Like it could save me from my selfish mentality or something in the bigger philosophical sense.

But it's like whenever I'm putting these stupid chemicals in my body I put others in front of me and I end up listening to their stupid stories even when I'm not getting sleep and peace myself. I've just been taught since my childhood to always be nice to people or was I just born stupid? But what do I get for that?  Could have had less troubles in school and better grades by fucking off those friends who needed my friendship but when I needed help or something most of them weren't there for me.  I always gave my time to listen to others troubles but when I talked about mine it didn't matter or some shit.  Being taught to be nice guy whole the time really ripped off my energy. It's not like you're going to change someone's life by just listening and you're not supposed to hear every single fucking thing in life, you're not God. Maybe I'm wrong about some things here, I've tried putting lots of energy in people's lives but what happened is mostly mine got sucked. Now I just need or alone time or association with good people.  Maybe no one even taught me this, I had to taught myself to be indifferent sometimes to people. If you're nice more than you can be you're going to burn yourself out being nice and later you're going to end up doing drugs and shit just like I did because you have tried to please some motherfuckers in every possible way even though they didn't meant to be pleased at all + you didn't follow your heart voice and some obvious shit. Self respect is very important. If you don't give yourself some time and peace, how the fuck can you offer it to others?  And I'm not God that I would listen to all your bullshit. Even God can hear it all but he won't always give us what we want, it's about what we need to grow out of this true selfishness. And however this paradoxical might be, maybe in the first stages we are selfish to give ourselves some true attention and healing.

What do you think. I'm just nearing 21 and probably I'm gonna look a few years in life and face palm at my past thinking as usually! hahaha

Almost died. Didn't smoke.

Hi everyone,
Just letting you know I'm pretty proud of myself in this. A friend and I were river kayaking and ended up down the wrong fork in the river. We hit a huge blockage of fallen trees and I got pinned underneath unable to get to air for quite some time. Tumbled through the white water and found a pocket of light where I grasped for the surface and was able to pull myself up and out.
My friend was out in a similar circumstance and managed to get out as well.
We both thought "this is it, were dead".
Hours later when we got back to our vehicles at the base of town he realized his pack of smokes was soaked.

He drove me to my truck where we had started our river adventure from hell and I gave him the "just incase I'm dying pack" and lighter that I keep in my truck.
I'm happy to say that amidst all the adrenaline and fear of death and finally ending a long day. I didn't have a smoke and gave away the one I had stashed incase of this sort of situation.

I'm now 5 weeks smoke free after being a pack a day for 7 years. And it feels great!
Just thought Ide let you all know that you can eventually start thinking like a non-smoker.

Day 9 - Feeling Down and Out

Day 9 is really a struggle for me . I’ve been doing great handling cravings up until now . I don’t understand why I’m having problems focusing at work and seem to have a hard time engaging. I hope this passes quickly.  I’ve been told second week is as hard as the first. I just gotta get through this. I don’t want to go back. Argh!

14 Year old boy trying to get his mother to quit, Please, please please help me.

Hello, i am a 14 year old boy from Sweden! My mother has been smoking for most of her life, shes 59 now, so, many years.

I have been trying, trying and trying to get her to try an alternative, which in Sweden is "snus" Basically tobacco with nicotine you put in the space between your gums and your upper lip, if that explains it.

Its still not healthy, not cheap either, but its cheaper and healthier than cigarettes, every time i ask her, to please just TRY it, just try, she just says, "the more you talk about it the longer ill wait to try" which just pisses me off.

Because i know damn well she will never ever try it on her own, and everytime i ask her to either try quitting, or something else, she says she needs to be "in a better position in life" which i know is true, she is in a pretty shit situation, with my siblings, but i know that wont get better either, so it all just ends up with the result of smoking for the rest of her life.

Please, if anyone has any advice for me, i will be forever grateful, and i will try everything, also, she lives on her pension, which in sweden is not very high, so paying around 6 bucks (56 Swedish Kronas) a day, is not exactly good for her economy either.

How do you not smoke when drinking alcohol?

Looking to any ex-smoker for advice!

I've tried to quit smoking a number of times, each time I'm fine until I drink alcohol and then my inhibitions fly out the window and I'm back to chain smoking. Aside from quitting alcohol all together, are there any tactics to use when drunk to prevent smoking?

Thank you in advance for any advice!

I quit smoking on Superbowl Sunday 13 years ago.

I know most of us are all jacked up for some Alpha Male Penis Jousting this evening but I am excited for a slightly different reason. Today is my 13 year anniversary of quitting cigarettes. When Adam Vinatieri drilled the game winning field goal in 2002 I had a drunken moment of inspiration. "If them Patriots canz do it sos can blegh blerg blerg," I said. 
For my friends that smoke I urge you to quit. Cigarettes are not your friends. They are a product designed and engineered for the sole purpose of turning a profit off of your addiction. The evil bastards who have created them have spent millions of dollars studying ways to get you hooked young and to ride you for as long as they can. If we lived in a sane and reasonable society the peddling of their product would be outlawed. Unfortunately we do not not so the only thing we can do is take away their profit by not spending money on their product.
Anyways, that's enough soapboxin' for today.
TL;DR - Cigarettes and those that make them: Fuck them and fuck that.

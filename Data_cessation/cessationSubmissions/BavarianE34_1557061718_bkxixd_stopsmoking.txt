Morning everyone (it's morning here), just come to motivate all of you around the world.

Don't forget to breathe in some fresh ass oxygen and ONLY fresh ass oxygen. Continue it throughout the day.

Don't forget to watch your PSA's. I will link them here for you:

1. [Stop Smoking Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kKN8_aa38A)
2. [Stop Smoking Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyO-2JQR7Fo)
3. [Stop Smoking Part 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aigcxc4JID0)
4. [Stop Smoking Part 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vjhae3IYCc)

I'm 8 months deep into this, and these videos have tremendously helped. If you ever get that urge to smoke, just watch the links i've provided. Save them on a playlist so you have access to them whenever you need to.

Good luck everyone, let's have another kickass day today.

OORAH!

Quit

Well was in bed watching you tube a few minutes ago.  Out of no where decided I am done smoking.  Of course its off and on in my head at random times throughout the years but i figure now is the time.  I always planned to quit around this age or maybe that's the excuse I told myself when i was younger so that i didn't have to quit, but whatever it really is time so that I can start leading a much healthier life style.

I think I am just gonna go cold turkey, I don't really like vapors, and i really don't like spending money.  (i already roll my own smokes).  I put the rest of my smokes and stuff away from easy access, now all i can do is wait and see what happens.  I also don't enjoy chewing gum very much at all.  I think the one thing ill miss is the hit on the lungs that is done when taking a drag.  I quit once like 10 years back and i would just take a real deep breath and hold it for a second and it feels almost the same way.

Any tips?

I realize people with experience in this will probably laugh and say I can't / shouldn't do it like this, and that's fine.

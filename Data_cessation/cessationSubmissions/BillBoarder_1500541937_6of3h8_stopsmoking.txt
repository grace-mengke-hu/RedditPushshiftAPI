Pack a Day - 35 yrs old. Am I doomed? Send some Encouragement.

Fuck... I think about quitting every goddamn day.  But every day I start my routine.  Morning Cig.  Drive to coffee cig.  Coffee with cig.  Add one anywhere.  And I'm 4 down before I even start work.  

I'm sick of it and I hate it... but its so hard to change the morning  routine!!!

Any advice or words of encouragement are helpful.  I hate this.  But its my normal.

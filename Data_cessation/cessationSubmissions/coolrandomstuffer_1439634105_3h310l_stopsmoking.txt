At times like these, ..

106 days after i haven't puffed once and have been nicotine free, cravings just puzzle me. Why do you do this brain? 

I also get, not so frequent anymore, bad dreams that i'm smoking and i wake up feeling shitty because i smoked, feeling weak and ashamed for going back on my word after a good nights sleep fucks up my day. 

Ignore me i'm just venting!

40 days

Saved: $526.09
Cigarettes not smoked: 1618

1618 cigarettes x 8 minutes per cigarette= 12,944 minutes รท 60 minutes in one hour= 215 (almost 216) hours spent not smoking.

216 hours that I have filled doing other, meaningful, amazing, wonderful things. I cannot believe how much time I would have wasted this last 40 days, had I not quit. 216 more hours spent with my kids, reading, walking, doing things I love. 

I am loving this. Loving life. Loving being a non smoker.

Life is good. The cravings are better, I breathe better, I smell better, I taste better, I feel better.

You can do this... it is so worth it.

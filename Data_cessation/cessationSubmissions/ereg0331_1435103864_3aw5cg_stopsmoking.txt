Leave for a few days

Understand or at least attempt to put yourself in another one's shoes and you will not judge so harshly.  I may have to find a less judgmental place to share my fears frustration and triumph.  No one wants to be put down or judged for their path.  This should be an uplifting place to come together with a common struggle we all have.  Each and every one of us has our own personal journey...... I'm going to leave my opinion at that.

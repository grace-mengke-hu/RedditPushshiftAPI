2 months, 6 days

It's been a while since I've been here. I am actually surprise how easy it's been this time round. I'm not thinking about smokes, don't get cravings, I'm angry for actual reasons, even my triggers don't have any sway. Hell I have stopped checking how long I have quit for. 
I gets to a point where if you hate them enough, it becomes a non issue.
Plus, more money to spend on beer ðŸ˜†

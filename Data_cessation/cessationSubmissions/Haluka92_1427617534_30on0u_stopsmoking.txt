147 Days and I relapsed due to course work

Hi guys.

I've only ever posted here once before and that was at the start of my quit. I now have relapsed unfortunately due to heavy stress load of course work and will be leaving for the duration of the course but I will be back once i have finished this course.

I just don't feel like I can do it without smoking. I'm sorry guys.

Thanks.

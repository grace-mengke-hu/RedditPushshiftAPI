Giving it a go...query inside

I have enough tobacco left for one more fag and once that is smoked I'm finished. Lighters, papers, filters all going in the bin.

I heard that a good way to quit is not to tell anyone (people on reddit aren't real people), forget the reasoning behind it though. Any truth to that. Probably won't mention it for the first few days anyway.

Is throwing up a side effect?

I got the flu on tuesday and quit smoking and haven’t had one since. I’ve felt nothing compared to normal withdrawals. I’m about over the flu now (the sore throat is the only thing that lingers) and I just got a craving for a cig and went and threw up. Is this common? I haven’t thrown up the whole duration of the flu or felt nauseous so I don’t think it’s that.

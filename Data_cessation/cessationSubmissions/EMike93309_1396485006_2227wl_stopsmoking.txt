On Day 3 with a Nicoderm Patch question...

So after 18 years of smoking (my habit is old enough to buy cigarettes...), 14 years at a pack a day, I was in the store on Sunday and saw a great deal on patches ($50 for three weeks... that's less than I spend on cigarettes). I was taking the week off work anyways, figured it was as good a time as any and took the plunge.

The patch itches/burns a little bit for the first twenty minutes, but then it's fine. They're leaving little pink squares on my body, but Day 1's irritation has almost gone away already. And they're working with very little effort on my part, so I'm hesitant to stop usage. I've always had sensitive skin anyways... a little skin irritation is still better for me than cigs. 

However today, my patch is oozing. Is this normal? It burned a little like normal at first, and then it got cold. And now there's a little slick moisture around the perimeter of the patch. Is this normal? Did anyone else who used the patch to quit experience this? I started getting some bumps aound the perimeter too, but then it went away within ten minutes or so.

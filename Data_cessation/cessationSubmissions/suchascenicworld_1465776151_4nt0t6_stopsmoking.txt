Quitting while being in a PhD programme..have any of you done so?

Hello,

This is my first post here. I had quit before..years ago and several times over. It took some time, but I did it. If you are wondering, One time involved cold turkey and the other involved E-Cigarettes (that eventually led to quitting completely).

Nonetheless, I guess that I am back on the ball with smoking. Has anyone quit during a master/PhD and/or know of any advice? For perspective, I work 6 days a week and I do have an anxiety disorder. Likewise, While I grew up in the US..I currently live in the cold and rainy, Northern UK.

Regards

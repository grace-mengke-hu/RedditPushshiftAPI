I'm done

Started out with hookas and rolling tea at 11-12 years old. Around 14 first cigarette. 16 first joint. Around 17.5 I started smoking a pack a day and weed 24/7.

I'm almost 22 and I'm done. 
The second I started smoking I've wanted to quit but I always relapsed for the stupidest reasons.

Last week I got a couple hours in and than I told my roommate about my cravings and he told me to just buy some cigarettes and quit "properly" by going to a doctor. 

I'm done taking advice from other people.
I'm done being weak minded and not resisting my urges.
I'm done with wasting all my money and smelling like shit all the time.

I am not going to let the nicotine monster control me anymore.

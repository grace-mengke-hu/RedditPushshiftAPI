Hi r/stop smoking. I'm hoping having the support of like-minded individuals on here will make a difference in me quitting for good. I have about 4 left in my pack and write my last exam for school today. I see quitting on the horizon. I quit for a month cold turkey, and before that, for 6 months. Sometimes when I feel shitty or angry, I relapse and then get hooked again. I don't want to be a smoker. I want to quit. Thanks for being here.

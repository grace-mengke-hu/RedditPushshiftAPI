How long realistically

I quit four days ago. I'm tired, I'm achy, I'm getting a cold in the middle of summer, and I don't even want a cigarette. How long am I realistically going to feel like absolute shit for? Nobody told me the withdrawal was this bad. I just want to mentally prepare myself for the torture to come. A week? Two? Forever? So far I feel worse than I did when I was smoking. Not very good motivation.

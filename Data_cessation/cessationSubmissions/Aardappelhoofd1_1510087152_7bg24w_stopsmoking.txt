2 days in and my brains are in panick mode

I quit. 1,5 days at first, came home from my date, found an open pack of smokes and smoked them all up in one evening. When I woke up again I decided to forgive myself for the quick fall back and quit anyways. 

Which was two days ago, and I am now for full two days without sigarettes. And I am going nuts, my brain is in complete panick mode and I feel as if I am on the urge of a panick attack at all time.

I quit for money, for health, for not being looked at with disgust for still smoking in 2017, and because I didn’t want to smell anymore. I always knew I had to grow up and quit one day, and now is the time.

I keep distracting myself, because I can’t just sit at home and sit. I can’t focus on books or games or anything which allowed me to smoke in the past. I am happy when I can go to sleep, so I don’t have to think about smoking for eight hours.

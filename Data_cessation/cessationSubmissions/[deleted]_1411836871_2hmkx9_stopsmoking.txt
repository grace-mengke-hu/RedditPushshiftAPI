Help :(

I have tried to quit for many years now... I think I have tried every method that is out there. From Allen carr to hypnosis and Paul mckennar. I tell myself almost every day that I won't smoke today but I always find myself with a cigarette. I feel like with every day I smoke my lungs getting more and more sick. Why do I keep doing that to myself. Please help :(

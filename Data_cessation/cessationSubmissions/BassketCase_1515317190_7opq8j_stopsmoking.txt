I started smoking 5 months ago and I have trouble breathing at night

I have a hard time falling asleep because breathing became so difficult, it feels like I can't get enough air in my lungs. Is that normal if you're a smoker? I only smoke about 3 cigarettes a day, so I'm not a heavy smoker. But this makes me want to quit. Also, when I smoke on an empty stomach or after waking up, I get dizzy spells and nausea. I have to sit down for a few minutes to be normal again. I guess my body still didn't get used to the nicotine.

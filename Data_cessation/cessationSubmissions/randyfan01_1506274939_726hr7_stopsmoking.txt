How long after taking patch off can you smoke?

So i may get some flack for posting this here, but i'd appreciate any advice i can get. in a nutshell, i'm a 1.5 pack a day smoker, and i have a 5 hour test coming up where a cigarette won't be an option. i plan on getting a 21 mg patch for the test and wearing it for the duration. my question is, how long after i take it off will it be okay to smoke? i'll only be wearing it for 1/5 of a day.

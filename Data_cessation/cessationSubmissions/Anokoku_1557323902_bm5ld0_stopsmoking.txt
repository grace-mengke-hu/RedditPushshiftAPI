Coughing up a River - 30 days

Good Morning Reddit!

&amp;#x200B;

I quit 30 days ago and I am really proud of that.

Unfortunately I decided to quit in the middle of allergy season in the great state of Texas (one of the worst allergy states) and I feel like I'm dying. 

&amp;#x200B;

I never really thought I had bad allergies until this year.

&amp;#x200B;

My eyes are burning. My nose drips for hours each morning. I woke up last night with my throat closing and finding myself unable to breath. I can't sleep because of the coughing and breathing troubles. I know that smokers flu is a big deal after quitting, but I'm just about done with the allergic reaction.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been on eye drops for the last month. Nose sprays. I've taken 24 hour claritin (which stopped working) and switched to benadryl. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the bright side everything smells amazing. Food smells different. I can actually smell the scent of my shampoo 12 hours after washing it. I've been able to keep smelling something. The scent of my stargazer lilies at my desk hasn't gone away for several days. (Where as it would go away a couple of minutes after first smelling it)

&amp;#x200B;

So, my quitter family, is this pretty much par the course? Are my allergies so bad because of quitting? What are your suggestions? How long should this last? Should I pay my doctor a visit?

Thanks so much,

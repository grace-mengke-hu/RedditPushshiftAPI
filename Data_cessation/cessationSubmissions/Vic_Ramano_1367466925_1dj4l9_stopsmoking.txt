My bladder cancer from smoking

OK long story short. Smokers get bladder cancer. 


Been a smoker since I was 19. Which according to my arithmetic was about a million years ago. 

The urologist removed a cancerous tumor the size of a quarter from my bladder. Luckily before it attached to my other organs. (If that happens then medically speaking, you're screwed)


Men have two sets of plumbing. Located in the front yard (penis) and the back yard (anus). To remove a cancerous tumor from your bladder. The surgeon goes through the front yard.


The surgery pain is.... I'll put it this way.   

Remember what it felt like when you got kicked in the nuts? Well you'll wish your surgery only felt that bad. Following that. The urologist will be running a two foot long scope through your front yard every three months. ...yeah good times


My smoking was more than an addiction. It was like a part of me. My twenty little friends named Camel and Marlboro were always with me through thick and thin. Comforting me when the shit hit the fan. Or celebrating with me when everything was roses. 


But cancer is a great motivator, convincing me to drop my twenty little friends. So I'm not taking their calls anymore. 

When that ugly hunger for a smoke starts screaming inside me. What's helped enormously these past few weeks. Is to use nicotine nasal spray. But I'd only recommend it to hardcore chain smokers trying to quit. You'll feel a chemical burning in your nose cavity, throat and then behind your eyes. It kills the craving in less than five seconds. But like I said. Only three pack-a-day smokers should consider it.


Good luck. And take a fool's advice. 


Don't wait until you're on an operating table. Trying to cut a deal with your maker. For just one more chance like I did. Now is the time to stop smoking. - Vic

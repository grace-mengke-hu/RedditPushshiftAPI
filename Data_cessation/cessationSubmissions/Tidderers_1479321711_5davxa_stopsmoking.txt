DAY 1! Want to quit after a bad weekend.

Decided to quit today. I normally smoke 15-20 cigs a day, and have been smoking since 17 (21 now). After a whole weekend of drinking and smoking I smoked over 90 cigs. I woke up on Monday morning feeling absolutely terrible, the hangover from drinking is enough as it is but my lungs were really sore too with a very congested head I also felt really down which I believe is from smoking so much. My last cig was at 9am this morning so 9 hours without a cig. 

More reasons for me quitting:
- I can't focus; I can't knuckle down and do something without losing concentration, I'm always thinking about my next cig or I think the task I'm doing isn't rewarding enough like a cig is so I don't do it. 
- Odour; I hate my breath and clothes smelling.
- It gives me anxiety, I thought smoking helps calm nerves but I've realised I'm A LOT calmer not smoking.

Wish me luck, I know this is going to be hard.

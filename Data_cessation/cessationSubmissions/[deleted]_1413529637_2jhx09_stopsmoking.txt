Relapsed last night after 31 days....

It was a drinks and dinner evening with some old college friends all of whom are smokers. Managed to stay clean for the first two rounds of smoking (had to go outside) but just standing there while all of them were smoking made something snap inside of me and inspite of everything I gave in.

Smoked like hell last night, even bought a pack and am continuing even today. Should I wait for a few days before retrying or should I restart asap ?

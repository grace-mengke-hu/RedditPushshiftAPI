3 Days of no smoking and I’m all ready sleeping better.

I was a 1-2 pack a day smoker, the first night was hell and the last 2 nights were rough, but I will say the last 2 mornings I woke up I actually woke up feeling rested and refreshed. Also the 30 dollars I’ve put in my savings account ($10.00 a day I don’t smoke) is starting to look good to.

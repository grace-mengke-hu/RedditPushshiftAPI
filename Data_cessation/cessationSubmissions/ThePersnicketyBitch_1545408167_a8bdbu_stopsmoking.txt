Smoke Free - Tracking Cravings?

Hi y'all! I've been a hopeful lurker for a while, finally made an account and have decided to quit as of TODAY! I'm a single mom of a 9 month old boy and I have to quit for HIM. I'm a very heavy smoker and this is going to be such a long road, but a necessary one.

 I have the pro version of the Smoke Free app, and I'm just wondering how you guys track cravings?? I'm 3.5 hours in (I usually smoke every 30 minutes) and right now it feels like my whole existence is a craving.

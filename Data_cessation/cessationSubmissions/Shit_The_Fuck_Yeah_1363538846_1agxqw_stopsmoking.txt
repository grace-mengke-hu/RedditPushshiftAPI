I relapsed :(

I got laid off *and* my girlfriend dumped me both in the same week last week.  You know smoked on *that* shit.  I smoked between 2-6 cigarettes a day since Tuesday.

I rinsed my pack under the faucet last night; it's the only way to be sure since I have puled half-full packs out of the garbage a number of times.  

So... this is my new day 1.  Do I need to get a new badge?  Will I have to go through w/d's all over again?  Any advice is appreciated.

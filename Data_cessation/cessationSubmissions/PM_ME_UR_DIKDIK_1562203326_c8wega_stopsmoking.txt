Finding it difficult to quit smoking my one cigarette a day.

Hi! I've made many attempts to quit over the years, but none have been successful. I've been smoking one to five cigarettes a day for most of that time. It's super easy for me to keep it to one a day (less easy when I'm out at the bar), but I can't kick that single cigarette. I think about it all day long and smoke it after work in the evening. I work with kids, so I pull out all the stops to keep the smell away. I'm ashamed of myself and what the parents I work for might think of me if they smell it on me. I have separate "smoking clothes" that are the only ones I'll allow myself to wear while smoking. I scrub my hair and hands every night with baking soda and apple cider vinegar. It's so much work to go through just for one cigarette, but it feels like it's easier to rationalize because it's only one. 

I'd be happy being able to smoke one every now and again without the urge to smoke one every night. If quitting altogether would make things more doable, I'll give it a shot. If anyone has been through anything similar or has any advice they think might help, I'd really appreciate it.

New ideas for short break?

I'm currently trying to quit, but one of the reasons I like smoking is because it gives me a "good" way to take a short break with a definite end; that is, I want to take a five minute break, and I know that the break is over when I finish a cigarette whereas watching YouTube or going on the internet in general makes it all too easy to lose track of time. That being said, does anyone have a way by which to take a short break so that it's easier not to lose track of time?

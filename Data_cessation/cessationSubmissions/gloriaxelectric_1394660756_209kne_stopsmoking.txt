Opinions on quitting using E-Cigarettes

I have been talking about quitting for awhile, but am so caught up in my habit that I could not imagine not having something in my hand/mouth while driving, or after eating, etc.    
    
A friend of mine bought me an e-cig for my birthday in an attempt to help me out. The liquid that the e-cig uses has about 1/3 the nicotine that is in regular cigarettes, and comes in flavors (I'm using "apple mint"). I have been using it without any tobacco cigarettes for three days now.  What do you guys think about using an e-cig to aid in quitting smoking? I think it's cheating, but I also think it's a good start.

Finally ready to try and quit but could use some tips

I've been a smoker for a 8 years (24 now) and I smoked up to a pack per day. Finally decided to kick the habit because of my health. I'm only 13 hours in so no medal yet but I have gotten rid of all my cigarettes, lighters, etc. The question I have is what do you do when you get the craving? Right now I tend to chew regular gum but it only helps so-so. Any other tips that can help me in the long run are really welcome to!

Edit: Thanks for the tips guys, I appreciate it!

2nd Edit: Made it through the 24 hours, wasn't easy but I made it nontheless.

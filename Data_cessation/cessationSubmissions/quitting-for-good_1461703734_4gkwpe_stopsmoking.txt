Last day smoking

Even writing this commitment is terrifying right now, but I am committed: this is my last day as a smoker. I've been planning (and trying) to quit for too many years for me to keep convincing myself it's ever going to happen unless it happens now.

Believe me, any words of encouragement will be very, very appreciated and would be a big help!

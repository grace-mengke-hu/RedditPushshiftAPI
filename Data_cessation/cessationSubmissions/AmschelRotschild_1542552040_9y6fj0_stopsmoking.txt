wife started smoking after 13 years :-((((

Hello redditers. I have a problem, a real problem. My wife after 13 years of no smoking (we both stopped 13 years ago) started doing it again. For now it's 1-3 cigars every 3-5 days, but we all know in time there's no chance that this will convert into more frequent behaviour. At first I was mad, we had a strong quarrel, with high level of emotions I demanded that she stops or leaves the house. She said she will stop. Next week I'm sure she smoked 1-2 cigarettes, when at work. We had another quarrel. Finally she admitted, she likes it, she cannot promise that she won't buy another pack.

I'm heartbroken, because now I know she was keeping it in secret for lat 2 months. I can't believe she decided to start this

damn addiction again. We have kids, I don't even want them to know, that their parents were addicts once. Kids of smoking parents have bigger chance to start smoking :(

We talked a lot, some of the reason she started were: stress due to hospitalization. I also suspect some female coworkers encouraged her to "smoke just one", but I have no direct proof for that.

I cannot understand that, and I want to help her stop. But what if she keep saying she doesn't want. 

Please Help!

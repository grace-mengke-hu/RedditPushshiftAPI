Here we go, day 1.

So yesterday was my birthday and I realized I've been smoking off and on for about 10 years now. I quit on New Years for about 3 months but when I started a new restaurant job, I relapsed have was smoking again.    
My birthday made me realize I'm not getting any younger. I need to start taking better care of myself and stopping smoking is the BIGGEST step I can take to do that.    
I won't miss smelling like shit. I won't miss having stank breath. I won't miss spending all that money on cigs every(other) day. And I'm looking forward to not have to worry about any of the aforementioned vices when I try to meet women. Plus, smoking fucks with my throat and makes my voice crack... won't miss that either!    
While I'm thinking about it, what are some good stop smoking smartphone apps that people use?     

Here's to day one and successful road to quitting!

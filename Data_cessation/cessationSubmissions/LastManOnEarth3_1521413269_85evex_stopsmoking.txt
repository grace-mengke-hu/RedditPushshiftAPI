Quitting with my Grandpa

Hey Guys,

I'm 17, which I'm not sure is allowed here, but I'd like to share regardless. I started smoking when I was 12, and I got myself upto about a quarter-half pack a day. That, coupled with my tall and skinny nature, caused my lung to collapse about 3 weeks ago. They had to put a tube in my chest, really an awful time. Anyways, my grandpa, a cigar user, came to visit me in the hospital and basically told me he'd be willing to do anything to get me to a healthier lifestyle. I told him I'd quit if he quits, to which he said yes. We both got ourselves some nicotine gum and we've been off the stuff completely, with the 3 week mark having passed this Friday. It feels so much easier doing this with a buddy, and my life's been getting better quick too. My girlfriend doesn't nag me about my smell anymore, and on the topic of smells, things actually smell and taste again! Life's looking up and smokes are in the backwindow. That said, I'm worried I'm gonna go off and get addicted to this nicotine gum stuff instead, which is far better than smokes, but still suboptimal. Anyone got any ideas for mitigating the risk of that happening?


TL;DR Fuck R.J. Reynolds.

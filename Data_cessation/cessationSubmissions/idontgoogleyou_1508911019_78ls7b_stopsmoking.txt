Going from occasional smoking to vaping

So I usually smoke anywhere from 3-6 cigarettes a day. I'm a fan of the djarum clove cigarettes (cuz I'm a jerk) and just tonight I purchased an aspire vaporizer and two juices that were on clearance at my local shop. 

I'm doing okay. It works great. I like the flavor, the smell, and the fact that I can puff while indoors but it's just not hitting the spot like going outside to have one of my cloves would. 

Idk if anyone has this issue but any advice, maybe an outside opinion would help.

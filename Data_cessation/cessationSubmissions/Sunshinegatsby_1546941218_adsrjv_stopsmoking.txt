How do you get back on the horse?

So I failed at my attempt at the weekend. I'm a single parent and the kids were staying with their other parent. I had found it really easy up until Saturday night. Sunday morning I bought a pack. Said to myself when I finished the pack, I would get straight back to quitting. I even bought cigarettes instead of tobacco, because I prefer tobacco/feel like it doesn't stink so much. And the tobacco would have lasted me a week, whereas a pack of cigarettes would be about a day. Finished the pack on Monday night, a couple of hours later, bought another pack. 

So, to those of you who have been here before, how do you get the motivation and drive back when you've failed? I am hating myself for giving in at the weekend and just feel deflated. I don't know how to get out of this mindset and back to feeling like "I can do this and now is the time"

I've got just less than two weeks till the kids are away all weekend again and I'm going to try and get lots of things planned with other people to keep me distracted. I don't want to make that mistake again.

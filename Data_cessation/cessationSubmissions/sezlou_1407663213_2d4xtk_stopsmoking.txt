My First Post- 10 DAYS CLEAN!! :)

Hi all, I'm new here :) I was a pack a day smoker for 3 years, I tried to quit once before but I only lasted 3 days! This time though my girlfriend and I are quitting together and so far it's been 10 days strong! Having someone else doing this with me has made it so much easier. I've quit cold turkey and don't even think about smoking as an enjoyable thing anymore. I know it hasn't been long and there's still a way to go but I'm really confident that I can resist the cravings, through the ups and the downs. But I know there will be times I'm struggling and need extra support so that's why I'm here :)

Smoked half a cigarette, disgusted this morning. I quit today!

I have quit in the past, but went back in times of stress and sadness. But lately I've been thinking about quitting completely, for the sake of health and life. I've been a smoker for years, but was at about 5-7 a day, when suddenly moved states amd hiy about a pack a day due to stress and shit in life. 

I did get tired and throw my cigarettes, but I have these cravings. And it seems hard to just not go buy a pack.

Do you guys suggest cold turkey, reduction in smoking? what worked for you?

I tried looking for guides, on this sub but couldn't find one. Any advise would help.


Edit 1: End of day, smoked 3 cigarettes and started reading Allen Carr's book and getting some background into quitting.  Though a big reduction from yesterday, still need to reduce further.

Thanks for your support!

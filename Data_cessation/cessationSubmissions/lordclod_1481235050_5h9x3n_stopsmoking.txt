chunks of terror

Damn, already 134 days into my quit, and I am still hocking up and coughing up and breathing up and trying to hack up brown chunks which are really hard to rinse down the sink. I did notice that the chunks became more frequent and my coughing them up increased when I actually did quit vaping. That, more than anything, convinced me that I should never ever ever never ever smoke again. Never.

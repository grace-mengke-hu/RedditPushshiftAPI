Can't stand not smoking when i'm drunk.

Hello there.

Well in the last year i used to smoke a pack of red marlboro the longer sized ones, and deciced to stop, i'm really fine i havent smoked "really" in like 25 days but when i go out on weekends and get drunk i always smoke atleast one, i just cant stand it. Is there anything i can do to avoid the drink trigger?

Oh by the way, i just woke up to someone trying to break-in to my house and i kicked him out on the window, broke his leg, so i bought a pack but i think thats kinda understandable.

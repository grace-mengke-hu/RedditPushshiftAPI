Advice on quitting for the first time

Hi everyone, first time posting here. I've signed myself up to stop smoking on 1st October (part of the Stopober campaign in the UK!).

I've read lots of tips on helping to quit. It'll be my first time trying to quit so I'm really anxious about it as having a cig is my way of dealing with stress.

Does anyone have any golden words of advice? I've also been looking into getting an ecig but the vaping scene seems so confusing! So does anyone have any recommendations on good ecigs which can be used with nicotine liquid?

Thanks everyone - just a bit stuck!

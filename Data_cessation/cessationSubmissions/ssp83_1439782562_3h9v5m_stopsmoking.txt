I smoked my last cigarette

I just smoked my last cigarette. Tomorrows monday and I dont want to smoke anymore. I hate it. It's gross, I smell like it, my car smells like cigarettes. Not anymore..i cleaned out my car, washed all my clothes threw away some lighters. Starting right now im smoke free. I know I can do it

Edit: Guys i broke down on Tuesday and I bought a pack. I smoked 5 cigarettes I was going to smoke this afternoon and was about to light one up but i threw it away and the lighter. I ended up throwing away the pack. I didnt think it was going to be this hard.

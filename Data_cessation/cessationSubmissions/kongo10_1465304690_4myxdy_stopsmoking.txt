After a year of non-smoking has anyone else felt this...

I went from a pack a day to quit and since I may have the occasional smoke...nothing regular...maybe once a month or 2.

Anyway...everytime I have a smoke I feel VERY ill...like nausea and weakness...I can't even have a cigar...anyone else get this?

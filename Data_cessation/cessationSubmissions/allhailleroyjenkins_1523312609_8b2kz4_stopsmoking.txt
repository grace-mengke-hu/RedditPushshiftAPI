I'm joining you guys today. F*** nicotine. I want my old life back.

I went from cigarettes to vaping. I understand that vaping isn't as bad as cigarettes,  but that doesn't mean vaping isn't bad. I crave nicotine the moment I wake up, and am constantly smoking all day. I use the strong stuff too. 

My hair is thinning, teeth getting yellow, having sleep problems, very high heart rate, my hands shake like a motherf*****, and I am spending way too much money. 

I'm quitting.

Good luck to everyone out there who is struggling.

Stuck? Scared? Still choking? I can't stress this enough - Allen Carr's EASYWAY to Quit Smoking is an incredible resource?

Although my badge is probably wrong, I just passed the 72 hour mark free of the slavery of nicotine addiction. The last time I did this, I was too sick to smoke and all I wanted was to get better so I could inhale poison. This is the first time I've quit and it actually feels like I quit. I attribute my success largely to what I read in Allen Carr's book.

For those of you waiting for a less stressful time in your life, don't. Do it now. Life will always be stressful. You will always find a reason to keep smoking if you think that way.

19, started smoking when I was 16, need some advice/motivation. Thanks!

So, I started smoking when I was about 16. I lived with my Mother who was single at the time, and she was actually the one who got me into this nasty habit. I don't want to portray my Mother as a terrible person or anything, because she wasn't, but she encouraged me to start smoking at that age and with her death six months later, I fell into a deep depression. During that time, I didn't really care about all of the negative health effects that are caused by smoking; I didn't care that I might die early from cancer or heart disease or something, so I had no real motivation to quit at the time.

I started university about a year and a half ago, and with the university being in Utah, smoking seems to be really looked down upon here. I don't want to be that person in class who reeks of cigarettes who nobody wants to sit next to. I also care much more about my health than I did in the past. So, today I've decided that I would give quitting a try. It's almost 4:00 PM, and I've managed to not light up once. The thing is, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to last much longer. I keep getting extremely intense cravings that I've never experienced before, and with the stress of midterms next week I'm not sure I'll be able to focus well enough to get decent scores if I try to quit now. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

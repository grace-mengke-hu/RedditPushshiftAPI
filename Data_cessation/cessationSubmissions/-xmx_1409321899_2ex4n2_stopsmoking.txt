Day 10!! Cravings reduced to almost 3 a day

I feel so confident about everything. No task, mental or physical, looks daunting. I still get cravings, but handling them is so much easier now.
Whenever I get craving, i tell myself, that i do not want to go through the first 4 days again, its not worth it. I like the fact that I dont feel tired after taking steps to my 4th floor desk.
Thanks to all of you here.
Also, whenever I get a craving, I just come here and read a few posts. Helps me fight it.

14 Days 5 Hours!!!!! ;)

Can't believe it! I'm so proud of myself! Haven't touched a single cig since September 8 @ 5am!!!!! Feeling strong, preparing for possible weak feelings - loving the smell of my hair! Lol I couldn't have gotten this far without all of you! Can't wait to keep on trucking with y'all TY!

First visit to the bar.

Today is my sixth day without a cigarette, like so many fighters here i started cold turkey with the new year after uninterrupted 10 years of smoking. Yesterday i was going to meet my friends and all the way while driving i was thinking about what should i do, what should i say, should i smoke just one cigarette with them , should i tell them that i have quit, will they laugh at me and the new year new me thing , should i buy a pack and smoke just one cigarette every weekend,  every possible question were going through my head. I arrived to the bar and i started to notice things that never crossed my mind before ,the smoke is everywhere, every body is having a cigarette in his hand, the ventilation system in the bar is a disaster, i can not handle all this smoke, my lungs are open finally, and I don't want to inhale all this shit again, how are the workers in the bar living a life like this , it is like they are mining coal down there except they are not taking the health precautions. All the thoughts were interrupted by the bartender handing me the beer, i finished it in like 90 seconds , one of the devils among my friends noticed that I didn't light a cigarette, and of course he  asked did you quit?, i answered yes, he said well done.
I excused myself to leave after 5 minutes and swore not to go to this shit hole again. 
The craving are still hitting me almost everyday,especially after meals, but i am resisting , and sport makes it much more easier to forget about this burden and enjoy the beautiful life.
I want to thank everyone in this subreddit, there is a lot of positive energy here, hang in there everybody we can do this and we will beat this addict inside our brains.

Small wins

24 days and counting this past weekend was torture. My fiancé and I went to visit my best friend for the weekend and it started with a four hour drive, which my fiancé still smokes so you could imagine that stress. We spent the weekend going out and after every bar there had to be a smoke break from everyone, except me. But I held strong and extremely happy I did. It's a long road but I will take every small win I get because it's the beginning to a healthier life.

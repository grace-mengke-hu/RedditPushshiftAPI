I am no longer ashamed of myself

I could post this in a number of different subreddits, but I've decided that quitting smoking was where it all started so I will post it here.  

Only about 3 months ago I didn't like what I saw when I looked in the mirror, both literally and figuratively.  I was fat(er), addictied to online video games, drank a lot of pop, ate crap food, had very little energy to live life, and smoked a pack a day which I would try to hide from a lot of people.  

I was really embarrassed of myself, I was stuck between always wanting a cig or having to step away by myself and come back smelling horribly.  It got to the point where I no longer liked to socialize because it was either be embarrassed of smoking or try to hide it and fiend for one all the time.  I'd even play my video game whenever I could get away.  

On my 41st birthday I just decided to start being different, and grow the fuck up and start acting like an adult.  I don't know how I did it but it happened.  I think eventually the shame beat out my desire to smoke.  So I smoked my last cigarette that day, and in turn I also stopped drinking alcohol, pop, and sugary drinks I often associated with smoking.  I was a little fidgety so I started exercising as much as I could.  My smoking OCD became exercising OCD.  I also quit playing my video game shortly after that.  It was all very liberating.  

I recently spoke to one of my lifelong friends and told her I am doing great, and actually believed it for the first time in as long as I can remember.  I said I quit smoking AND dropped 10-15 lbs and she asked if I was some sort of superhero.  Really I just did a lot of things I should have done a long time ago.

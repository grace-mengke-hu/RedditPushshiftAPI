3 months! This is happening.

The warm weather is kicking my ass a little. I've gained 10 lbs, but I'm watching that closely now. I've noticed my feet and shins are swollen recently, not sure why. My BP is close to perfect. Once I remind myself that I don't have to wait to do things anymore I tend to get a lot of stuff done. I like not smoking. I like breathing.

Getting over the psychological addiction...

I've been smoke free since the 1st of August. Getting over the nicotine withdrawal was a pain in the ass, but that's over now. Now I find myself  just missing the habit so much. 

I'm 17 (yes I know I'm young) and I smoked for 4 years, about a pack a for day the past 2 years. I'm starting a new school on Wednesday and I just don't know how I'm going to do without cigarettes. Smoking on my breaks is all I've done for the past 4 years. It's how I've met many of my friends. I don't know how I'm going to be able to remain smoke free.

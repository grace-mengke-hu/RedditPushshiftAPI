Just made it to 40 hours!

This is a big deal for me. Like, a BIG deal. I've tried quitting multiple times before, but like clockwork, I would get drunk and have a cigarette. This time is different though. I can feel it. Maybe it's because I've actually been telling people I'm quitting. To have the outside support of friends (even friends that smoke) is a boost.

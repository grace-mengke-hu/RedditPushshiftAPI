Day one + a question for this sub

Day one here. It's not going so bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, I have cravings, but they are not as uncontrollable as they were on the one thousand previous attempts. 

I feel and anxious and panicky and full of rage and suicidal, but that's nothing new, just my everyday bread and butter. I'm not even sure it has to do with the addiction withdrawal yet since it hasn't even been 24 hours.

I have nicotine lozenges in my bag, but haven't used them yet. They taste horrible in my opinion, so I prefer to avoid it.

I also have a question for this sub: can anyone tell me the name of the app with green graphics that everyone uses here? I couldn't find it in the app store. I have downloaded Quitzilla, but the green one looks better and I figured out that if everyone uses it, it's probably because it has additional options or something. Is this the case?

Don't give up, cigarettes are for losers!

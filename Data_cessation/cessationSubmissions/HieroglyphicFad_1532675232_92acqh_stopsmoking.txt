I want today to be my last day smoking

I have said this numerous of times  but I am really going strong this time. I bought a pack and I regret it. Along with smoking I want to stop drinking because that honestly triggers me into smoking. I finally quit coffee. I just want to make a change for the better. I'm 26 and I want to to do a complete lifestyle change.

been smoking for 19 years

first time poster and third time quitter,  though i have to admit i was not serious the previous times.  smoking has been my favorite thing to do, first thing i reach for in the morning and last thing i have at night. i feel like i'm letting go of a serious relationship, a relationship that has used and abused me,, and i think it's about time we part ways.
a got a scare recently, a close friend died of lung cancer and it has me shaken. she was a heavy smoker but seemed really healthy, so that had me scared shitless.  
this time around, i feel more confident quitting.  i joined this sub to be with like people and to share and be part of a force of people who are serious about kicking a disgusting habit. 
i'm doing it cold turkey, i think there is no other way for me. it has been 2 days since i quit and so far -- i'm feeling good, went to the doctor for a scan and everything and got a clean bill of health. 
---- so i guess, to all of us good luck and may be force be with us!!

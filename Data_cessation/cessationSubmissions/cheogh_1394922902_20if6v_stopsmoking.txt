I hate that I smoke. I want to quit, but also don't want to...

I've been a smoker for about 1.5 years, and smoke about 4 cigs a day. The longest I've gone without smoking in these 1.5 years is 5 days. I don't know what I wanna do. I live alone and there's no one to talk me out of it. I feel the craving, but feel like shit every time I start smoking one. I wanna quit, but a couple of hours later, I convince myself somehow that it's okay to go out for a smoke. I am ashamed to admit my habit. Except a couple of friends, no one knows that I smoke. 

I want to start reading Alan Carr's book, but am afraid that it may not really help. I've seen people here who have read the book and failed to quit. I also see people who succeeded, but what if I never quit! I don't want crappy lungs. I don't want to wake up coughing like an old man everyday. But that feeling of lighting up a cig when you're craving one is amazing. It dies out before I'm halfway done and end up throwing that cig feeling like shit. 

Help me!

EDIT: Just ordered the book from Amazon. It'll be here in 2 days and I'm on my way to freedom from those damn cigarettes. You guys are awesome! Thank you for the support.

For those of you who are skeptical like me, search for some success stories from this book on YouTube. It's helped chain-smokers of many many years finally quit. If they can do it, why not us?

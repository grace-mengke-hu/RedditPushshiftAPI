I dont know how to not smoke.

I started smoking 40 years ago.  I was very young.   I have no clue how to perform in life without a smoke.   I can mentally connect a cigarette to everything. You deserve it. You accomplished this, reward. Time for a break.  Stressed out? Relax with a smoke. Angry? Puff it away!!

I've tried everything I can to quit.  And I've failed. And failed.   I've overcome many things in my life with nothing more than willpower. I just don't get it. Why can't I kick this habit?

Any ideas?  I refuse to quit quitting.  It's an expensive stinky filthy addiction I want to be released from.

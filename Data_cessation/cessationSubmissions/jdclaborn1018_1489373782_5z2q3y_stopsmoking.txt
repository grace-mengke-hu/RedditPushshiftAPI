Declaration to stop smoking for good

Only to be followed several hours later by a trip to the liquor store to get a pack.

Yesterday morning I vowed to end the relationship with cigarettes. I was at the beach, smoking it. Midway through it, I told myself after I finish this one and go back to my car, I'll smoke one more on the ride home and trash the rest. I did. Then I went for a bike ride. Exercised and showered and felt great. Late afternoon I found my self walking to the liquor store to buy a pack. Smoked one. Trashed the rest. And called it for good. This morning I was driving to a book store, stopped to buy gas, popped into the store to see what goods they had and walked out with a pack of smokes. Smoked 5. Trashed the rest. Called it quits. Bought a pack less than an hour ago. 

This worries me. I feel such disdain for this habit and despise what it does to me. A few hours later with no cigarette and I'm not so perturbed by my distaste for it. It actually sounds like a good idea.

Does anyone else experience this extreme oscillation? How does one not act on the impulses?

For you cold turkey quitters, how do you handle the abrupt crave session?

Seeing as how I am in the middle of one right now, I figure I will ask.

Thoughts going through my head:
1) Can I just call a buddy to "bring me a smoke"?
2) Why does my saliva taste funny when I "just want a drag"?
3) how long is five minutes, really?
4) I'm glad I am doing this, as every fit I get strengthens my resolve
5) it's hard to think about anything else right now
6) 12 days is 51 minutes away
7) damn, that was only a 4 minute fit, felt like half an hour...

I'm already feeling better, no nicotine involved!  Thanks for reading my rant :-)

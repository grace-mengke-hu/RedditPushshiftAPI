Armed for the first day

I've been smoking since 2009. I tried to quit before but didn't last.
Usually every week I used to buy a whole package (10 packs) for better price, yesterday when I was getting off work, remembered that my last pack had only 2 left. I though to myself, what if I don't buy more?
I was pacing around the room, thoughts were racing in my head, a bit later I threw the last pack in the trash can and go home.

Today morning I got up, took a shower and went to work, and got these on the way.

I'm 21 hours without cigarettes as I'm typing right now.

I also got a can of beer. I want to avoided coffee today, and drinking beer in the morning is so strange to my daily routine, it had some interesting effect, but also made me sleepy. I need liquid stimuli to keep my brain going though, but coffee, tea and energy drink all go great with cigarette I'm afraid I'd be reminded of smoking haha what should I do?

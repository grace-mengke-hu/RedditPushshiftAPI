Try not to compare too much

This sub has helped me realize how different it is for everyone. For some it gets easier after the first week, for others it doesn't get easier until 4 years later. The only thing you can be pretty sure of is that your experience will be different, so don't get discouraged if it seems more difficult for you.

I'm writing this post because so often I come on this sub and get discouraged by people who are "on day 20 and the cravings are pretty much gone, I hate the smell of it, and I just feel bad for people when I see them smoking".

Well, I'm on day 90 and it hasn't gotten much easier. I still love the smell, I still envy people who are smoking, and I just want to cave, every single day. I suppose maybe I'm a little less irritable than I was the first couple weeks, but the cravings are daily- if not hourly. I'm gonna keep fighting the little demon though.

It sucks ass, but I'm doing it. I'm trying my best.

Stay strong.

Free! But stiff, tired, unfit &amp; clogged... Does anyone of you have the same issues?

I quit smoking 3 weeks ago. And I am very happy about it! This time I worked with patches and it has never been so easy. Meanwhile I am nicotine free. But I have some problems...

All in all I feel stiff &amp; unfit &amp; tired. And I can't go to the bathroom in the morning anymore and everything is done. I have to go several times a day and feel fat/full/clogged. 

Do you know that too? If so, how did you get rid of it?

I am now trying to tackle it with sport - now more than ever! I try not to accept the tiredness and the feeling of fullness, although I am actually not fit at the moment.

For digestion I take flea seeds and linseed, drink kefir and sauerkraut juice. No improvement yet.

I would be very grateful for tips. When I tried to stop smoking in the past, I unfortunately started smoking again because of the problems mentioned above, because they annoyed me too much.

This time I am absolutely convinced that I really don't smoke anymore.

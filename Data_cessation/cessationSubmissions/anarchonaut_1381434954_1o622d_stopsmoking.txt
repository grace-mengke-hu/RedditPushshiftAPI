Day four..I caved.

Got too stressed about my classes and bought a pack, guys. It was mostly the headaches and the muscle tension that broke me...does anyone have any methods to deal with this? I've tried breathing and being mindful of when I am physically tensing up- but by the middle of the day my upper back, neck and jaw are killing me. Advice?

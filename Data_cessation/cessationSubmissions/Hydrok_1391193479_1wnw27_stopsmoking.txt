I quit three weeks ago, I feel so awful.

I feel like I have a cold, a sinus infection, and strep throat all at once. All my mucous is clear so I know it's not an infection, and I have no fever. I am just freaking miserable though. I blow blood out of my nose every morning, I can't sleep through the night, and my throat feels so sore it's hard to swallow anything. I am working halls cough drops at a rate of a bag a week. How long does this go for? I am really hating life right now.

EDIT: I realize that asking reddit for sound medical advice is stupid. Mostly I was just looking to see "Yes, sounds familiar to my experience" or "No, this is unfamiliar" Thanks for the feedback guys.

7 days. Thank you to everyone

Today marks 7 days.  I am so proud of myself for getting this far.  It has not been easy, but it is getting easier.  I am so thankful for finding this subreddit.  Everyone here has been so helpful and supportive.  I just wanted to share the good news with you all.  I am not going to accept failure

And I will always remember the wise words of what someone told me here, "The craving to smoke will pass whether you smoke or not".  I tell myself this every day, and it helps so much.  

Keep going guys.  Take it one day at a time, one hour at a time, or one minute at a time.  I was a 15 year smoker who would go into panic when I even went 5 hours without a smoke.  Now I am on day 8.  It is possible.  Do whatever it takes.  As long as you don't smoke.  I chose NRT and it was the best decision for me.  Whatever works for you.

Thank you so much reddit!  7 days strong!

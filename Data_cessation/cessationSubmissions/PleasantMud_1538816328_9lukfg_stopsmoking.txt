Smoke got in my eyes but they are finally clearing up

Hi guys. I posted the other day on r/stopdrinking so I think it's time to visit here and post my intention to stop smoking also. The two things are best friends, smoking the Bert to drinking's Ernie, and I feel if I am shoving one out the door, I may as well shove the other one out too.

I don't enjoy smoking anymore. I don't like the smell, the taste, my skin, the expense, etc etc etc.

For some reason, I have built up some kind of crazy notion in my head that smoking 'helps' me in some way. I think the hardest time for me to ignore cravings will be around 12pm on Monday in work. That's when I normally have my first workday cigarette. I'm going to bring my runners, leave them in the car, and when that craving alarm bell begins to go off in my head, on those runners will go and I will power walk around the horrible business park for 20 minutes.

I feel like crap today because I chainsmoked/drank wine last night, and I just hate wasting another Saturday in bed when it is actually a stunningly beautiful autumn day out there. I'm sick of missing it!

I also have that horrible clogged up feeling in my throat/chest. I can't wait until the coughing starts and I get rid of the gunk!!! I am just so determined.

I also bought a really cool wall calendar at the start of the year and I got these green circle stickers. Every day I don't smoke or drink, I stick one on there. I only have one sticker for October so far and I only managed maybe 2 in September and 2 in August, but I want the rest of the calendar to be full of them! It might seem a little childish but it is so good to have a visual aid as a reminder. I love looking at that green circle on the 4th. Now it's time to get to work and add some more on!

Here's to a bright future ahead.

A new start - And this time it's final

I posted a little while ago with my previous attempt based on just pure willpower. It didn't work out. I'm not sure why.

This time around though, it will. I've scored a date with a proper 10/10 stunning woman and I don't want to blow it for myself by stinking of ciggarettes or interrupting our date while I nip off outside for a smoke.

I have a reason. A real reason to quit. And this time it's final.

Fuck you smoking. Wasn't nice to know you. You have until Monday to move your stink out of my car.

3 days, 21 hours and 46 minutes later...

Obviously that coincides with my last cigarette at 00:00 on Jan 1st. I am 36, been smoking for 20 years now, about 8 cigarettes per day. I work in IT , as a manager and I tend to have 1-1s over a coffee, at the office, while having a cigarette as well. This is the hardest part....my routine was going to the office, making myself a coffee and starting the day downstairs over a smoke. For the past 3 days I have been working like crazy while avoiding to go downstairs with my colleagues. This is probably my 8th or 9th attempt to quit smoking, longest one being for 30 days. Something happens at day 30.....most times I go out for a beer and just ask for 1 single smoke...and after that the world falls to pieces. It's either NO SMOKING AT ALL, not even a puff or you will regret it. The shittiest thing is that, after you smoke that first cigarette and realize what you've just done, you feel like shit. So...if I want to continue socializing with my mates at work...what can I do when I go downstairs with them and they all smoke ?

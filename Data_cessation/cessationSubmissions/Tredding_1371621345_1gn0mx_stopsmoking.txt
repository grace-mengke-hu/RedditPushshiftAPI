Quitting & Hypnotism

Greetings redditors. I've been smoking for a few years now and my habit has recently gotten terrible. I'm only 18 which is bad enough, but I'm also diabetic, so I REALLY need to quit. I have the right mindset and all, just not yet enough willpower.

I mentioned my habits getting worse to my therapist and she told me about how one of her coworkers has a hypnotism method to help people to quit smoking. I wanted to know if anyone has had any experience with this.

I understand hypnotism can really only work if the person believes it will, and I do believe it can help.

The first 3 days over and over again..

Although I have been smoking for just about 2 years now, its still the same problem. I have tried to quit many times, stayed clean for a two weeks at my best, and 2 hours at my lowest. The instant high that you get from cigarettes is my worst enemy. Multiple times, I have lasted 3-4 days without any cigarettes with ease only to remember that instant high and lose out. The problem with where I'm from is that you can easily get cigarettes in 1's or 2's without buying a whole pack, this can mean its easier to smoke at work (without your family or friends knowing & hence avoiding all that counseling), and its easier on your pockets. I started smoking as way of getting over somethings in life, though I'm more or less over it, I still use it as a reason whenever I want a drag. The gist of this is, smoking isn't the answer to getting over ANYTHING, maybe therapy could have helped. I'm starting my *quiting* ritual again, and hopefully for one last time. No more excuses, no more "one last cigarette"!

Doing this for my dog...

I have a had a lot of fails lately, but I want to do this for my dog Harvey of 14 years who we put to sleep on Wednesday. My heartbreak has been intense. He was such a good boy and he loved me at my worst and at my best. He taught me some of my best life lessons throughout my twenties and thirties. With his passing I have a lot of emotions about my life passing me by. I want to get healthy in his memory and for my kids. He always wanted the best for me so I figure I should want the best for me and my family. So I promised him I would quit. I also promised him I would walk his sister dog Heidi more regularly. When I had the urge last night I popped the leash on her and off we went. I hope he was looking down wiggling his butt out of excitement for a walk, and that he was happy and proud of me. 

I really don't want to let him down.

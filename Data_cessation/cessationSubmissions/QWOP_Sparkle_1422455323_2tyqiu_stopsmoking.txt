What the hell is wrong with me? :(

I can quit and stop smoking for days...weeks...even months...then every now and then I just have the odd 1 or 2 and then I'm off it again for another few weeks or months.

Why can't I just resist it entirely :( Sometimes it's not even a 'trigger' as such, I'll just get a sudden craving and think 'eh, why not?' then I feel all the negative stuff about 5-10 minutes after and I remembered why I quit...

I do this *all* the time and I just don't know what to keep me saying no for good and for the rest of my life...

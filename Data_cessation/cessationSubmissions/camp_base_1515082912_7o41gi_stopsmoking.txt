Day 3. Quit 3 times in 3 months. Anyone else do this ?

Quiting is going great except for the failures. quit for 3 weeks and started again (because I am a moron). Quit for 2 weeks and returned to my folley. After making it 2 or 3 weeks there is no reason to go back - I will just have to quit again.

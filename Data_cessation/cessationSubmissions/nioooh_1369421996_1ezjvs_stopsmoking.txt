I am on my way. It may be the good one.

Ok. Maybe I will be smoking again in two days. Who knows. I just want to share that tought. 
I have been on many drugs in my life. If not all, really much. 
I decided to stop before the week end so I had no reason to get out to buy another 20 killers pack before the week starts again.
And I am craving for it. It's such a feeling I never had for any other drug. I never had that feeling for weed or cocaine. This tells me how bad cigarette is. Who would go in his dust bin just to get a last rush ? 
This sounds like a damn addict. 
I have been watching a few documentaries about the cigarette industry.
They did their job well, and they learned their lesson.
I hate them, but it's so hard to quit smoking.

It's been a little over two months and

Even though I'm doing great I still get so scared I'll slip up. I quit for my kids, and for my own health and life quality, but I have very bad depression and anxiety and no longer handle stress with the high levels of stress in my current situation. I've quit drinking because if I drink, my brain craves one, and in my inebriated state I have slipped up before while trying to quit in the past, and I don't want that. I have almost slipped up since my recent quit, but I didn't want to let a puff or two reset my timer, so I kept it the same since I hadn't had a full cigarette. (If I had reset, my self worth would have gone down, and I would have most likely bought a pack because I felt like a failure and worthless, also I had been drinking around people who smoke, bad combo, but I thought of my kids and refused any more offers)

So I'm doing really well, keeping away from smokers as best I can, and feeding my brain with a book and Reddit on my breaks at work.

But lately I feel like the cravings are back in full force, and it's killing me. I asked to bum a cig from a friend at work on a particularly rough day thinking I'd "just have one" when I got off work and back to the house. Well I cleared my head of stress while driving to get food before going home, and decided to toss it instead, knowing that "just one" could easily turn into "just a pack" and then I'd be back to full-blown addiction and really hating myself. But that was a close one. 

How long until the cravings are completely gone this time? Last time I had no cravings for a few weeks before my boyfriend broke up with me. This time it's making me crazy and I can't ask my boyfriend for help as he's not dating me any more. Just looking for any advice, since I came here seeking help for these unnatural cravings that seem to last hours at times, even after all this time, and to surround myself with those who are non-smokers.

Quitting smoking while being a heavy drinker.

Alright. Here's my story. I've been able to quit smoking multiple times for weeks. Easy. Problem is, I'm also a drinker. Drinking and smoking goes too well together for me. I obviously know the easy answer is to cut my drinking habits. I wish that was easy, but all my friends are in the industry, and they all smoke.  I don't want to just get rid of all my friends. 

But my main problem is that I personally am in the beer industry. I am close to opening brewery. And, I have multiple friends who are bar owners and Mae managers. Half of them smoke. I'm going to be around beer all the time. My main problem is drinking obviously, and I love beer enough to where I don't to quit that. But, whenever I drink, it always leads to smoking. I know there's lots of drinking a who don't smoke, but I'm already one of them so it's pretty hard to just quit. I'm at an impasse here. I even know not smoking helps beers taste better... But as soon as a beer is me I want that beer. And once the inhibitions start, the smoking starts. I think maybe getting a ecig would be a good start don't know if that's a good way to go. 

So basically. I guess, fellow alcoholics or people who are in the drinking culture, what's the best way to quit?

How long does nicotine stay in your system? Will my GF be ok?

So my girlfriend needs to pass a nicotine test for her new job. we quite on monday 10/12 but she had a few puffs off one last night. Her test will be on the 26th. I got her detox tea, she is drinking alot of water and we have been going to the gym to sweat. will she be ok? is there anything else we can do? we kicked the habbit for good but we are worried it may be to late.. please help.. 

Edit. Thank you to all of your replies. I never knew Reddit can be so supportive and helpful

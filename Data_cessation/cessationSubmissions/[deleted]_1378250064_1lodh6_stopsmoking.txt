Could never make it past 2 days. Going on 9 as of today. The difference....

Meditation! I know it sounds hokey (at least it did to me at first) but it works, and is surprisingly well suited for someone trying to quit smoking.  

Beginning meditation primarily involves focusing on your breathing and appreciating every breath you take in. It made me focus so acutely on what I was putting into my lungs and how it made me feel that it made just the thought of smoking feel more disgusting than it ever had before. It also helped to clear my head and keep me focused when I had the really bad cravings. 

I also printed out and put a chart of the positive things that happen to your body when you quit on my fridge. Hitting that 24 hour achievement (carbon monoxide no longer in body) and looking forward to the next achievement (at 48 hours there is no nicotine left in the body) and so on really helped. Knowing that just one smoke would put me all the way back to the beginning helped me not to cheat. If you're anything like me, one cheat leads to another, until you're right back to smoking as usual. The chart really helped to prevent cheating - even once.  

This is my first post here, just thought you might want to hear some strategies that are working really well for someone else. Good luck!

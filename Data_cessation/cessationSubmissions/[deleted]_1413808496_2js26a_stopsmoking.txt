Can't buy it yet, but I can almost see it my garage.

I was a bit surprised when I saw it's been more than 250 days, it haven't been easy at the start, but it's really worth it, just stick to it folks!

This beauty was and still is my motivation, and in a few months it should me mine, all thanks to you guys at /r/stopsmoking (I haven't been really active in the sub, but reading your posts was really helpful at the start) and some will power, so thank you all!

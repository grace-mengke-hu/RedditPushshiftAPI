Day 4

I'm hoping I'm over the hump with day 4- quitting smoking has been one of the hardest things I've had to do.  I have addiction issues and trying to eat clean and quit smoking has been my most recent goal.  I am at a week of eating clean and day 4 of quitting smoking- I've been going on and off for years, I quit for 2 years then was smoking 1.5, then quit 4 months then smoked for 1 then quit for 2 etc. I just want to end this! Thanks everyone!

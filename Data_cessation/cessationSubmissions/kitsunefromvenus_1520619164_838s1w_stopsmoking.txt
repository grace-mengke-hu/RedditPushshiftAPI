6 days in and feeling amazing!

First post! I'm 21 and been smoking for 8 almost 9 years and this is the first time wanting to stop smoking. I took the opportunity while I have no money and had a fever/bad cough and the two first days I actually cried alot and been so irritated. But after that it got easier every day that went by. Except the cravings I've been feeling great! I've been trying to get the coffee related trigger out of my life so that's when the worst triggers rage but at least I'm aware. I'm also hanging out with my smoker friends for the first time today and it feels great! I'm reminding myself that the craving are just my brain craving endorfinds(spelling?) so I'll prob start working out and taking walks. Feels wrong that we spend less than 15% of our lifetime outdoors.. I'm having a bit of identity issue now tho, like, who am I? What do it do with my time now? But it's also exciting!
Thanks for your attention, it felt great writing it out!

When did your cravings end? I look forward to it! Slowly but surely!

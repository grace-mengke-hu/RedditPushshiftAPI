Being away from home can be really trying...

To be honest, it didn't take much \- I checked into my hotel and I was not expecting the room to have a balcony, and on the table outside sat an empty ashtray. I immediately ruminated on whether or not I was going to buy a pack...break my 87 days nicotine free... because of a silly ashtray on a  balcony \- like it was my own personal invitation! 

Im telling myself over and over that I don't actually want this, it's only what I have been so use to when travelling  to pass the time, that there are so many other productive things I could do instead of this. I went to the shops &amp; bought some food and water. I did not give in to the temptation and buy a packet. 

I will not smoke with you tonight.

Today, I quit!

I recently started smoking, and took to it very quickly.  While I've only smoked since this past Christmas, I immediately found myself smoking at least 10 cigarettes a day.   I won’t lie, I do enjoy having a smoke, but in the short time since I’ve started I have known two people who have died due to smoking.  One colleague at work died very young from a heart attack the other day, and it was because he was a smoker.  Another acquaintance died of lung cancer, again because of smoking.


Smoking is not worth dying for.  I quit!

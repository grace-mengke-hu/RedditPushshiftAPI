Depression and anger

On day 20 I think, just recently  noticed that I really think I have some depressive symptoms and I get angry really easy. Last few days all I want to do is sleep. Has anyone noticed this during their quit?  I've never read anything about depression associated with quitting smoking. I can understand the anger, could be associated to the anxiety of quitting. A friend even noticed that im shaking too which I had noticed in the past 3 days. Comments/suggestions please!!

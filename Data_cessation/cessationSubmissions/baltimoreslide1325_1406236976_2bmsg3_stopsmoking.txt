Closing in on 5 days.

- Slept 13 hours last night (I guess the insomnia is over).
- Days 4 & 5 are apparently my hard days (in other quits I screwed up here--not this time). I keep telling myself that it'll get easier right on the other side of this struggle, because that's probably actually true. 
- Patience, jedi!

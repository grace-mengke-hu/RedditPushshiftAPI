Having a tough time

I'm on day 39. My quit has been going great but I'm hitting a rough spot today where I really feel like lighting up. Didn't sleep well last night and exhaustion was what took me out the last time. Guess I'll try to lie down and put on my meditation app. In reality I know a cig won't really help me feel better, and it's never just one. Thanks for reading, it feels good to be accountable on here. I don't want to have to reset my badge.

Amazing insight and the start of my journey.

First, key me introduce myself. I am 19 years old, been addicted to tobacco since 16. In the 4 years I smoked I managed to quit smoking several times. I did it once for 1 month! , A record for me. I believe smoking goes very well with the way I love in the sense that it creeped into every corner of it. When I eat I smoke, when I party I smoke, when I'm outside I smoke. It has become a part of me. Last week I need a lighter, so I asked a guy to hand me one. He pulled me out of a bag of candles which he use d at a funeral. I'm not a very religious person but this resounded big with me. I told myself I'm gonna end up dead if I continue this path of self destruction. But now I am still smoking... It seems that I forgot what impressed me so much a few days ago very fast. Now I want to beat my record( no smoking for 1 month) and stay on track. It would help me allot to hear from you guys. Thank you for your time!

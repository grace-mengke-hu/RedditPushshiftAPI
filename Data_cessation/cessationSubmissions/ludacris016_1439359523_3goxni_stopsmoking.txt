Day 1 - Read through Allan Carr's Book

I just read Allen Carr's book "Easy Way to Stop Smoking" in one sitting (halfway through the book i wanted to quit, but didn't because he says: quit after the book, so i stayed up the whole night reading on ...). I had my last cigarette 40 minutes ago. I've been smoking for 10 years, around 20 per day. This is it! I'm free!
 I just ordered two physical copies of the book and will give one to a friend.

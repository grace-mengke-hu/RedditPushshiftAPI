Cigarettes make you rush through life.

I can follow up with examples, but it truly speaks for itself. Whether it'd be me being in a movie, hanging out with friends, doing just about anything one could do... After about 10 years of smoking, everything I ever wanted to do seemed to come second hand to making sure I had those bullshit few minutes outside taking a drag. I hurried my way through so many life moments just waiting to fix that nicotine itch... It's unbelievable to think about as I type this. Let's all break the curse, my friends. Let's every one of us live happy lives free from this burden of being a slave to these garbage sticks, they don't do a damn thing but kill us. To those those struggling- stay strong! We've got this in the bag... It's scary to think of life outside of smoking. And as this road is jagged and bumpy, no matter how hard it may seem, the destination will make it the best path we've ever taken.

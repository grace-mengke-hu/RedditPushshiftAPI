quit smoking and dx'd w. COPD

I smoked for about 20 years, recently quit and had a pft I am 40 years Old. See results here:
FVC  5.02. 98% of predicted
FEV1 3.65 89% predicted
Fev1/fvc is 73%

Since I am currently 40 and Doctor says this is mild Copd, will it impactMy life span and quality of life? Doc says to not smoke and not worry.
However when I read online having these numbers at age 40 is not good and mayImpact my life as I get older. Can anyone comment? My understanding based on what I read is that COPD may not actually kill me itself but it's actually quite likely I will suffer significantly either from breathing difficulty when I am older or from other diseases that are caused or made worse by COPD. I'm pretty worried. Thanks.

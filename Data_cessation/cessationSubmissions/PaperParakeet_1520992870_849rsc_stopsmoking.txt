Has anyone been successful with a quitline?

I'm a smoker. I've quit many times, lots of times for a few months, once for two years. Everytime, it's been cold turkey. Today I called my states quit line, and enrolled to get the patches/lozenges combo. Theres just no way with my current job and habits I could cold turkey again  it without losing my mind. I always needed a few days alone, and I just can't do that now. I think the two weeks waiting for them will give me time to mentally prepare myself with coping mechanisms for the torture of withdrawl/freedom from slavery, or I'm lying to myself and it's my  addiction excited about surviving another two weeks.

The time I quit for two years, I survived a few weeks with a 5 lb bag of dum dums. I had a horrendous amount of expensive dental work as a result, so I'm looking for other oral fixation options that don't include sugar. Or things that keep my hands/mind busy. I'm an artist, and although I have art related triggers (time related processes), I'm  thinking I might draw/doodle through it.

I started again because I went out drinking with friends. And 14 years later, here I am. I didn't intentionally stop/start drinking, I'm just not a drinker and go years without drinking, no thoughts about it.  I didn't connect the two, until, well... apparently they're connected for me--so I'm choosing not to drink either.

Has patches worked for anyone else? Does it just prolong the withdrawl process?
What do you do to keep your mind, hands, and mouth busy?

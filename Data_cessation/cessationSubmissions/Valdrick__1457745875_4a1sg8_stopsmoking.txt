Why and how did I quit.

I used to smoke 8 to 12 cigs. a day for the last 20 years. I remember a few years ago I tried to reduce it to 1 per day (just before going to sleep), but after a month or so I gave up and returned to smoke half pack a day. The thing is that I loved smoking. Especially if it was just a few cigs a day... after lunch, with the coffee, before going to sleep... That is why I didn´t quit before. I don´t think quitting is hard, what is really difficult is actually convince yourself you want to quit. I told to myself, I will stop smoking when I become a father. And that´s basically it, my wife is 5 months pregnant...
As to how I did it, as I said, it´s not that hard. I just don´t light cigarettes anymore. Once I convinced myself that I was actually quitting, I fixed a date, committed to my wife, and when the day came, I smoked the last one knowing it would be the last one. I threw away the remaining cigarettes, and I convinced myself that I wasn´t going to smoke ever again under any circumstance. And that´s basically it.

Oh yeah I have cravings, but it´s honestly nothing you can´t handle. I just remember that nothing changed, I am not smoking ever again.

As to all this magical things that happen to you when you quit smoking... most of them didn´t happen to me.

I can´t smell better. My sense of taste hasn´t changed. Neither has my skin.

What I noticed though is that my cardio improved significantly. That much is true, in the same exercise my heart rate is around 15 ppm lower (from the second day I quit smoking already) and that really surprised me.

So bottomline, if you want to quit, just be really convinced before you bother. Commit. And when you have a craving, remember that nothing has changed. 

Also I did it cold turkey. Why? Because no matter what, the experience was gonna suck. So I didn´t want to change a poison for another one.

Smoke free app mountain climber missing?

I used to have a nice picture of a person climbing a mountain at the bottom of the smoke free app. Somewhere in the app I added a custom “mantra”  and it showed in a text bubble at the top of the mountain. Today I don’t see it though. Any way to get it back?

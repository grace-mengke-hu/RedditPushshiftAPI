Day 2 not smoking: On Chantix

Well I am two days into the not smoking part of Chantix and its been pretty difficult. I don't think I could even have gotten this far without those pills. I noticed how I went from a pack a day to 1/3 as of 3 days ago. 

For me I was an extremely habitual smoker. After a drink, before bed, certain events, etc. Ive had a hard time so far with the cravings but not sure if its more of the habit.

Anyway, going to be around this sub for some help. First time ever quitting so I am really going to put my best effort forward. Any advice appreciated.

Thanks

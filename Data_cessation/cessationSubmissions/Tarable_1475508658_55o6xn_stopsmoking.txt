2 Years!

I still occasionally have vivid smoking dreams, but they've subsided for the most part.  The dreams usually consist of smoking and then soul crushing guilt afterwards.  I imagine I'll have those for a long time, but they're tolerable.

Since my quit date, I've ran 13 half marathons, and I'm in the process of training for a full.  Being able to breathe feels so good, and I've accomplished things I never thought possible for myself.

For me to stay a non-smoker, finding a rewarding hobby was the key.  I also surrounded myself with non-smokers/other runners, which helped a lot.  

Never give up.

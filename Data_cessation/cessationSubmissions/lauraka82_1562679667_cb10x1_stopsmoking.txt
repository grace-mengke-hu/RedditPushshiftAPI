Almost 3 months

Anyone else feel it is harder around the 3rd month? And does it get better? I have heard of the horrible 3’s so I’m hoping that’s what I am experiencing. I’m he past month and a half have been rather “easy”, BUT for the past week I have felt that I am back in week 2 or 3–struggling to find things to distract myself and thinking about smoking more often than I have been. Grrrrrr...Anyone else also have this happen around the 3 month mark?

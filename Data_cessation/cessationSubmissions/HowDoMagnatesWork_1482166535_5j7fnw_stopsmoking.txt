I hate the holiday season

So, I started the patch three weeks ago.  Didn't put one on yesterday or today.  This weekend I finally got hit by the holiday depression/anxiety that usually sits on me all December.  This year it didn't hit me until about the 17th (which is really nice, considering).  But I really, really want a smoke.  Not going to do it, just thought I'd bitch about my misery.

Stay strong, folks.

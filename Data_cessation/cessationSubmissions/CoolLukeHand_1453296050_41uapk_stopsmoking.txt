They are in my dreams :(

80 days done and never been so pleased with anything else I have achieved for myself. Smoker for>25 years and stopped cold turkey on my 43rd birthday to give you background. Smoked for most of that time Marlboro Reds but for past 5-10 years had dropped back to Camel blues due to reds hurting too much. I used to carry two packs around, one lights for early in the day when lungs couldn't take it and then Reds for later on when I was up and running properly... unbelieveable.

Big target for me now is 100 days on 9th Feb. 

Had my 1st ever smoking dream a few nights ago. Dreamt I had broken down and had a cigarette on a night out when I was drunk.. no memory of the actual act of smoking but waking up the next morning in the dream I paniced and was frantic. I didn't know what to do but eveuntually after a lot of back and forth I decided not to worry and that i would just stop dead again and this time never break. It seemed to take an awful lot to come to this conclusion and a huge part of me seemed to want to say "ah well..." and give up and be a smoker again. 
You cannot believe the relief when I woke up and discovered I hadn't actually had a releapse and the whole thing was just a nightmare.. amazing. I don't often dream but this was dramatic stuff and of course felt so real.
Those dirty things really  do dig in and my brain seems to be breaking down a bit. Oddly physically and in my day to day life I wouldn't even think about a relapse apart from the ocassional pang in a bar... Will just have to keep the pressure on and never forget what I have been through with those horrible filthy gaspers.

Roll on 100 days clean and healthy and smoke free!

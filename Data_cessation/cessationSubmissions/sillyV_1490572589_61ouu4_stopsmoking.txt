My Story

I have been smoking just over a pack a day for 12 years, (ages 18 to 32), started smoking in the army because everyone around me was smoking.. not sure why.. worst decision of my life.

Smoking had caused me so many issues..  financial strain, so many arguments with my wife (she used to be a casual smoker and quit a few years ago) health issues.. (I had a Heart attack scare at my early 30's.. ended up being an anxiety attack (I think) but it was scary as hell, I think it was because I smoked too much) I had(still have to some extent) smoker's teeth and nails.. and breath.. everything. 

April 17 last year I woke up  with one cigarette left in my pack, I smoked it on my way to the bus station.. and decided against buying a pack right away. I had a really terrible cough and decided that I will buy a new pack once it will get unbearable..  and then I just didn't. after a week I decided that I'm gonna try to make it an official quit attempt (longest I made it previously was three weeks after reading the Allen Carr book, it didn't stick that time)

almost a year has gone by, two observations:


1. Dreaming about smoking sucks..  you wake up with a huge sense of self loathing.. still convinced that you failed and smoked.. and than you realize it was just a dream and you are actually still good.. 

2. of all the cigarettes, the one I miss most is the one that helps you go through a boring activity.. like waiting for the bus, or such like.


had an urge just now, so decided to write about it to let it out.

I apologize for my grammar and spelling. English is not my first language. also I'm tired.

for those who already quit, stay strong. for those about to quit tomorrow, quit today instead.

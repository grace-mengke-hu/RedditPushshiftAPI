Day 9 - Things are looking up!

I quit smoking a little over a week ago. For the most part, I feel that a majority of my cravings have stopped - and I have used the e-cig but ONLY if I was drinking, and that was seldom over the past week or so. The best part - I can smell and taste better again! I have rekindled my love of spicy food, and the only gripe about being able to smell the flowers is it is allergy season. Everyone has been super supportive of my decision to quit, and I feel like I got this this time. 

I hope all of you feel as good as I do right now at this stage :)

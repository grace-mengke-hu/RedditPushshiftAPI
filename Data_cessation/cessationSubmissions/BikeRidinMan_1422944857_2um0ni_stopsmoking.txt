Non-smokers: Time for me to hit lurk mode again!

In the last couple of months or so, I've read many motivational stories, watched our sub membership grow by 1,000+, and hopefully  guided a few folks in the right direction. Y'all are doing fantastic! Keep it up and continue to help the new guy/gal that stops by and reaches out. I'll be back around next new years to help some newer folks (they just don't know it yet!). Join me in not smoking today!

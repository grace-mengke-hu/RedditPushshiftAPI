About to stop smoking again, some advice please

Hey guys, I discovered this sub about 5 mins ago and I love it. 

I’ve been smoking for more than 10 years now and I’ve tried to seriously quit 3 times, the longest I lasted was 1 month and I failed because I didn’t take the trigger of a small party seriously. 

So now I’m thinking about quitting again, but there are some relevant circumstances. First, every time I’ve quitted I’ve become the angriest most focused mf I know. I love that in theory (the productivity and the energy to do anything), but I hate feeling that way. It’s like being constantly in a fight. Normally I’m kind of a easy going guy who doesn’t take anything too seriously, sometimes even too much. 

Now I’m planning to change my job REALLY soon and I don’t know if it is a good time to quit. Starting in a new company can be a serious trigger given the new social situations and the stress that comes with the uncertainty, but on the other hand I’m guessing that the social pressure can be a good regulator for my bad mood and the extra energy can be of great help in those first weeks when you’re still learning what to do. 

So, what do you think? Should I start right now or wait until I’m comfortable in my new job?

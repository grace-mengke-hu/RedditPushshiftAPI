So i just found this subreddit, and today is my last day

I've been planning to stop for a while now: with my mom, my brother and my dad, to stop smoking. My dad stopped it first, that's just who he is. He went through so much shit in his army career he can do Cold Turkey with cigarettes like its nothing (Maybe... i dont know exactly how it is) he hasn't had a cigarette for a month now.. Okok. that leave me, my bro, and my mom. Me and my mom are stopping tomorrow (in 10 minutes for us)... I turned 18 today. my brother is stopping tomorrow cuz hes got 3 cigarettes left...


Heres the deal:

I dont know what to type on this subreddit, but please help me stop. This is a whole family effort weere doing and we need it to happen.

I rely on support.. i dont like reading things that have been posted.. If people tell me to do something. I hope to god i can.... Please encourage me......

As much as i hate to say it, I'm going to have my last cigarette right NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I got 5 minutes till im done smoking for (hopefully) Good!!!!!

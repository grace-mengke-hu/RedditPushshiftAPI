I've been lurking here for a while ashamed...

As the title says I've been lurking around here ashamed that I'm not be able to stop this vicious cycle....Every pack I tell myself that is the last one but I still find myself buying a new pack... I'm sick and tired of smoking, I hate it, but I still can't stop it. I wanna ask what I'm doing wrong, but I know that buying a pack is what I'm doing wrong.Tl;dr: I suck and I need to restart my badge.....

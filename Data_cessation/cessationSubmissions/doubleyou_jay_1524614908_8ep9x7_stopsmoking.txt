Thinking about it

Over two months smoke free now after a cold turkey quit. Family coming to town this weekend and staying with me Wednesday to Sunday. Few of which are smokers. I’m already letting myself think about cheating. I don’t want to but in the back of my head I am justifying just one. I don’t want to but can’t stop thinking about it. Ughhhh

Keep striving for that smile-star.

Just checking-in, and noticed I've got 755 days - I just hit my 2 year mark last month on Valentines day.

For those in the first few days, weeks, and months:  It absolutely gets easier.   I was a smoker for 20+ years.  Now, after 2 years + smoke free.... I *rarely* have fleeting thoughts about smoking.  The first few months were tough for me, but as time passes - so do the cravings bit by bit.

Ultimately, though, I just feel SO glad to free of those ridiculous misconceptions and illusions that kept me a smoker for long.  All I really had to do, was fucking stop. Keep it up folks!

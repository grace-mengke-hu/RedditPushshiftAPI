Advice Needed: Don't want to quit, but have to.

Pretty much what it says on the tin. I've been a 20 a day smoker for about six years now. I've tried to quit smoking three times (one ongoing), every time I failed simply because I didn't want to quit. So, I hear what you're saying; If you don't want to quit, it won't be successful, so don't. It's not that simple. 

Smoking is just too expensive thanks to the taxes (UK). I don't have much of an income of my own; my partner is the breadwinner. He has decided that because of the expense, we are going to quit smoking. He wants to though, I don't. By the way, you're not going to convince me. I've heard all the arguments, I know the facts, I've watched relatives die of smoking related illnesses. I am not swayed. At the moment, we're trying vaping. My partner is finding it alright, as he's a pipe-smoker, but for me it's just not the same. I have tried lozenges and patches in the past. It's just not the same. 

So, TL;DR. I love smoking. I don't want to quit. I have to quit. Advice please.

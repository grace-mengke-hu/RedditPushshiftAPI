3rd day in, massive void in my life

I was a vaper for 2 years and a chewer before that. I've finally gone cold turkey. 

I feel like I've lost my lover. We'd spend most of my waking hours together. Her sweet, fruity breath filled me with an ecstasy like no other --a focused dizziness, a calming energy, a distracted focus. 

I will miss you, but we can't be together anymore.

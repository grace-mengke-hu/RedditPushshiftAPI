Increased feeling of attraction

Hello world! 

So I'm still smoking sadly, but I'm definitely feeling closer to quitting for good. 

Does anyone else feel like the opposite sex notices you way more when you give up cigarettes? 

It happened to me a while back. I was day 60 of no porn and masturbation (NoFap) and as soon as I got into quiting smoking, everything changed. I felt happy and also noticed more girls checking me out. A lot of it came from me finding myself more attractive I guess (subconsciously), but I'd really like to know if this is a real thing and if anyone else has experienced this. 

Bye bye for now!

After months of struggling I am finally back on the horse and 16 days strong! Thanks guys!

Last year I had been in a really bad car accident right around the time my wife and I found out we were expecting a baby girl. The car accident basically forced me to quit for a few weeks and I managed to stay away from cigattes until roughly the beginning of April after being offered some cigarettesat work (I know it's weak, but I think that is the nature of caving). Until recently I was really struggling to quit again but I can now proudly say that I have now been 16 days clean! I don't post much here but I lurk a lot and the few times I have posted you guys have told it to me straight. The way you ought to. So I wanted to thank you all for being supportive and understanding what this is like. Keep it up!

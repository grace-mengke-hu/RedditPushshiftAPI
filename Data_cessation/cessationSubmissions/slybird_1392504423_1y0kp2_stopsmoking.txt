46 days without smoking.

Chicago, I spent about $8 a day, almost a pack a day. My no smoking account is getting bigger. Craves still happen about 3 to 5 times a day, but are getting weaker. I don't think the craves will ever go away, just have to live with them. Went to bar with friends for the first time, wasn't tempted to go outside even once.

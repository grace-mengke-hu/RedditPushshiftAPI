smoker or non smoker?

first post here so i'll start from the beginning!

had my first cigarette in the parking lot of my high school freshman year. for the first few i smoked them wrong and never inhaled. i was the cool kid and encouraged others to do it. when i learned that i had to inhale it was terrible, couldn't keep it down but had to keep my ego up so i kept on. 

several years later i smoked a lot more. i've never been a pack a day smoker - i always have some left at the end of the day. 

present day i only smoke when i work. i'm a diesel mechanic so i'm allowed to smoke and work on the trucks at the same time. outside of work i don't even get cravings or think about them. even after eating, sex, driving. i don't even allow smoking in my car because it makes my car stinks. 

what's up with that? am i a smoker or what?

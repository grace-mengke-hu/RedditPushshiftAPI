Difference maker in stopping/starting a habit

I must have quit smoking a million times before I got it right and quit for good. The difference between the final time and the others was simple:
I DIDN'T TELL ANYONE I WAS QUITTING, AND I STILL WON'T!!!
Every other time I felt like I needed to let everyone in the world know I was quitting. I continually externalized my choice and expected pats on the back and such to quit. The final time I quit, I told nobody. I made this about me and not about what others thought about me. I forced myself to do this solely out of my own needs and wants rather than for my friends or family's approval.

Find a program, make a plan, do what you gotta do, but do it for yourself and nobody else. No one else's plan will work. You started quietly and in a unique way, now quit the same way.

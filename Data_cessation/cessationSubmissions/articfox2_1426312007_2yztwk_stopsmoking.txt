I know i should quit smoking, but i really don't want to. Any tips?

So im 23 years old, have been smoking since i was 15. I love smoking. I love waking up in the morning, drive to grab a coffee and having a smoking. I love smoking after dinner, after sex, ect. I work construction, and am surrounded by smokers 15hrs a day, 6 days a week. Am currently laid off, but will return to work in a month or two. I really do not want to quit, but deep down i know i need to. Any advice for a guy who doesn't want to quit?

I was reckless last night, but I toughed threw it.

Finished up day 2 last night. I had told all my friends I was quitting, so I'd be laying low for the next couple weeks. But then I found out my girlfriend's best friend was celebrating her birthday last night. She's a very important person in our life and I felt compelled to go. 

Unfortunately she, and her boyfriend, and several of our friends are all smokers. Plus, they were going to a brewery, and drinking is a *major* trigger for me. I wrestled with whether or not I should go for the whole day, but I decided that it was better for me to risk it and to DD for everyone to make their night safer and more enjoyable.

So I did. It got pretty tough at times, but I got through it. No smoke. I'm feeling pretty proud of myself. The previous times I tried to quit I wouldn't have made it through it, but I did it this time, and that's what counts.

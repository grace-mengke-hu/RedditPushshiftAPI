Need help, advice, tips, and support!

Hey there,

I've been smoking sense I was 16. I'm 21 now so four years I've been smoking. I've tried to convince myself so many times that "This will be the last one". I've gone a month or so with out smoking but got back into it after a few drunk nights . 

My best friend smokes which doesn't help. But my other best friend encourages me to quit all the time. My mother would rather have me smoke cigarettes than E-cigs for some weird reason so that hasn't helped..

I want to quit for myself, not for anyone else. I'm sick of smelling like smoke and worrying about my breath all the time. I'm sick of spending 7$ every single day for that new pack. But, my problem is that somedays I don't think I need to quit. I'll convince myself that I'm still young and healthy yada yada yada.. I'll tell myself "only after sex or when I'm really stressed" but we all know that doesn't work.. I've made so many quit days but when that date came to play , I didn't last but only a few hours.

How can I stay on track? What can I do to not relapse into smoking those captive method 72's? What are your stories and how did you quit?

Anyone else quit that suffer from OCD or anxiety?

So it's been like 19 days or something since I quit, I never really had withdraws or intense cravings, the quit itself has been very easy.  That being said I do suffer from OCD and primarily anxiety, my OCD is based entirely off of the amount of anxiety I am feeling.  Recently I have noticed that the OCD has taken over and is more noticeable than before.  I find myself at work taking longer to do a task than I should, because I am never satisfied with how it turns out.  I am currently an overnight stocker and will spend 15 minutes on a single box of items because i don't like how the other items are on the shelf....it's hard to explain but it's a lot like being in "the zone" where the only thing that is important right now is how the items look on the shelf.  I don't blame the nicotine i just think that I no longer have my coping mechanism...just wondering if anyone else has experienced this.  Not something that will make me start again, just wondering if I'm alone in this.

TL;DR OCD and Anxiety get worse after 2 weeks of not smoking.
Edit* I am a stocker not a stalker

Accountability

I got to around 2 years of happy freedom. I never thought about smoking. I had no desire to ever smoke again, then on a night out last October-ish I had one, which turned into a few more the next time, then I'd buy a pack before a night out, then it was every weekend - and here I am. I told myself I could have a few just when I'm drinking, which is the road to ruin. I won't make the same mistake this time.

Since I first quit, 851 days ago, I have got married, started a brilliant new career, and spent a good chunk of that time living in an amazing new country. It was all so much more enjoyable without the worry of 'the next smoke'.

I still haven't got into the routine of habitual smoking, bar when I drink, but I know where that ends up - smoking every hour or so and letting it control my life. If I don't stop now I'll be at that stage in a month or two I think.

So I'm back to /r/stopsmoking which was fantastic for me when I quit the first time. The Allen Carr book is by my side right now, and I plan to read the mofo cover to cover today.

Quitting smoking was one of the best things I ever did. Time to do it again.

Thanks all. Now how do I reset that badge? :P

Today :)

So today I finally did it. I had the willpower to take all my ciggarettes and rip them up and throw them away. First time in 2 years that I have had a serious commitment to not smoke. My Fiance and I are expecting a baby boy in late April, April 24 is the 9 months and when shes due. I can't stand the face that I have put it off this long. Only thing I know right now is that I am so happy I finally did it, Im tearing up. Ready to start my new life smoke free.

I know it will be tough, but with working 40 hours a week, I hope it will help. 

Edit: Thought I would update for everyone. I recently purchased "Allen Carr's: Easy Way to stop smoking." I have to stay even though I just started reading it today, It is an amazing book. I would recommend it to anyone who has thoughts of stopping smoking :) Also 3 days in and I havent really had many withdrawls. Im a little more irritated but that will go away soon enough. Thank You guys/girls, for the messages :p

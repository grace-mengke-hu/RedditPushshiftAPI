Day 6 Reflection

I quit smoking again! 6 day, 1 hour, 24 minutes ago.

This was my probably my 5th/6th+ quit attempt. I lost track really. I've been smoking for 14 years. I was up to just over a pack a day.

I decided to quit because of:

--Health

--Wealth

--and for better control of my personal behavior. 

I realize I have a problem during a few instances of the times I am running errands for my elderly mother. She wants me to take her shopping.  From about 45 minutes after my last cigarette and beyond I would be somewhat of a jerk because I would be ready to go--Ready to go have a smoke! After being called a seven letter word that starts with A and doesn't end in 'wesome,' by mother, I realized that my nicotine addiction damages the relationships I value most. Also, I kind of made a scene of myself at an airport because they confiscated my lighter and disposed of it in a wastebin when I needed it to smoke at the next airport 14 hours away. At that airport I didn't have any ignition device and it was MSP where there is no smoking. I had a 1 hour layover. I could have not made it outside, to smoke, back through security, and back in due time. 
Then my flight was delayed an hour!!! So I was like 20 hours into my travel and I had a miniature Howard Dean moment where I uttered some frustrated sound like "Brrrawwrrl!" at the information desk lady. 

I planned my quit on Monday the 10th. I would quit Saturday. My last cigarette was at 10 PM Friday night. I decided to reduce my smoking to about half the usual that week and to begin cold turkey Saturday morning. 

I identified the things that triggered my relapse in the past:

--I believe Alan Carr's logic in on NRT: Why replace the drug you're trying to free yourself from with a cleaner delivery method? That doesn't address the wealth or behavior issues I am addressing with my addiction. The problem I have is with NICOTINE, not tobacco. Simply, cigarettes are the most efficient nicotine delivery systems and if I stay addicted to NICOTINE I will likely switch back to cigarettes eventually. 

--Not remembering why I was quitting, forgetting my reasons for the quitting desire, so this time I would combat this by making constant affirmations of my quit reasons. Health, Wealth, and better control of my personal behavior.

--Drinking alcohol. I will avoid drinking at all cost for 6 months and if drinking cannot be well avoided for a social occasion the drink limit is 1 drink per 1.5 hours. He's bringing me a stein from Germany for my birthday. It will be hard to avoid drinking with my air force nephew, age 21, because I know he is bringing me a german beer stein for a birthday gift. Maybe we'll go to the german bar and I'll order a grapefruit raddler because of it's great taste and low alcohol content. I must not smoke. I must not get drunk. Maybe I'll do the unthinkable and tell the bartender I want nonalcoholic beer in my stein. That would be best. 

--Deeply affective stressful and/or depressing situations. Like getting written up at work and stuff like that has triggered my relapse in the past. So has the death of a close one. So I am going to avoid stressful situations to the best of my ability and choose a more healthy stress relieving activity... Aerobic Exercise with Resistance Training. I'm batman ;)

--Cravings! Strong cravings are going to be dealt with by drinking a bottle of water.

Here's some things that are going well:

--I feel amazing. I have energy. I can breath so much deeper. 

--My skin is looking better and feeling better

--My body feels like it is coming alive, back from death...

--The cravings aren't that bad and they get easier to deal with. Shorter. Less intensity.

--Irritability into calmness is improving.

Here's some problems I'm having with my quit plan so far:

--Coughing up all this phlegm triggers cravings because I abused cigarettes as cough suppressants.

--avoiding stressful situations that trigger cravings is resulting in me to get behind on some work I needed to do that stresses me out when I do it because normally when I do this work I chain smoke. It's my college algebra homework. I tend to enjoy being highly stimulated when I do any mathematics. 

--I'm a little emotional hehe. Drama King.

--Sweats. My body is so confused. I am feeling clamy.... sweaty... Not sure if I'm sick or if it's normal withdrawal symptom. 

--Now that my sense of smell has returned, I find some smells just outright annoying that I wouldn't notice before, like if someone else around me didn't wipe too good. I can notice that now.

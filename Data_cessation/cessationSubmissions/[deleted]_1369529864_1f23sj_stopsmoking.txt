Found out I have COPD

So, I still have to get some testing done to see if it was caused by chronic bronchitis or something more serious (chances of cancer are low, but I'm paranoid). It was definitely a result of being a smoker for the past ten years.

I just had my last cigarette. Chances are, I'll always have this even with quitting, but not quitting could kill me. What's worst is I had quit for nearly a year when I got pregnant with my now 20 month old son, and developed this after I started again.

I wanted to tell any of you who have quit, DO NOT start again. I can't begin to explain how much I regret it. You can stay quit, you need to for your health. Please, be smarter than me.

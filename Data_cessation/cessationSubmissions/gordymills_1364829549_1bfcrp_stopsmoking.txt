Got some new flair today to celebrate a BIG landmark!

One year ago today, after being a pack-a-day smoker for the better part of 13 years, I smoked my last cigarette.  

I had tried numerous times to quit in the past, with most attempts lasting a week or two, and the most successful attempt (with the help of Chantix for the first few weeks) lasting three months.  This time was cold turkey with the help of sunflower seeds, and a little competition with my girlfriend.

I'm not normally one to brag or boast about my accomplishments and achievements, but this is one that I am extremely proud of, and wanted to share with all of you.

How will I cope at work?!

So I quit smoking (again) 5days ago and it's going fairly well. Worry is that I start back at work tomorrow after a weeks holiday and am worried about coming across all my usual triggers - walking to the bus stop, before morning meeting, before writing difficult email, after writing difficult email - basically all the time!! Plus my job can be fairly stressful and everyone I work with smokes, joining colleagues for a smoke was a great way to relax and catch up. Really hope I can commit to quitting this time üòÅ

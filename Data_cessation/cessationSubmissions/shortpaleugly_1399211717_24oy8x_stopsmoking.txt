Put all your cigarette butts into a mason jar

A neighbour of mine quit smoking using this technique which I think might help y'all.

He decided to put an end to his nicotine addiction and stopped smoking indoors and started going outside into his garden to smoke. He then got a mason jar and put all his cigarette butts into the jar that he placed in his new smoking spot at the back of the garden. He began the process of quitting using the traditional aids (patches) but whenever he stumbled and succumbed to having a cigarette he'd put the butt out inside the jar.

After a while the thing was full of nasty, throat-scraping, nose-scratching, eye-watering, stomach-churning butts and brown tar water and all sorts of crap.

After a while of using the patches his cravings subsided but whenever he felt the urge he'd return to the garden to his usual spot, grab the jar immediately and take a whiff of the contents and basically nearly puke his guts out.

The association between the putridity of the contents of that jar and the urge to smoke became concrete after a short while.

Before he moved he was smoke free for just over a year.

Hope this helps.

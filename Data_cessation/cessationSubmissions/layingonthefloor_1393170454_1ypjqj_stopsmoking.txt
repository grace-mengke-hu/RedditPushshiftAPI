Any one else had bad side effects from champix or other quit smoking tablets?

I am on day 60 with out a cigarette,  61 days in half an hour. This is the best I have ever done and I could not have done it with out champix. Most of the side effects from champix were managable.  I was so sick after taking each tablet, I was dizzy all the time, and had pretty vivid and crazy arse dreams! Except some times those dreams would be nightmares which I would usually wake up from crying and can't sleep for a while after that. The worst dream I had was a monster ate my 2 year old son, then started vomiting him up piece by piece. First an arm, then a foot, a piece of skull with hair still attached. Thinking about it still makes me cry. It was one of the most real dreams I have ever had. I woke up crying and hugged my son for the rest of the night. I still have problems sleeping because of that dream. Every little detail seemed so real from the temperature of where I was in the dream,  the smell, the feeling of the ground beneath my feet. I know it wasn't real only because my son has not been eaten by a monster. It all sounds stupid I know. Monsters are not real, but that dream.... it was the worst! Has any one else experienced this? I have since stopped taking champix as I couldn't handle the dreams any more, but I have no interest in smoking again which is amazing! Sorry if this is a stupid question or not the right thing to be posting in this sub. I've never posted before so it's kinda scary.

Hoping this is the push I need

I'm posting here for some accountability, because I hate myself right now. And I'd really like not to.

I am a 29 y/o female. I've been smoking since I was 15. Nearly a pack a day for the past 8 or 9 years, aside from a 6 month spell I quit 3 years ago.

I had a wisdom tooth extraction done on Thursday. Know it's a bad idea to smoke after so I told myself I'd just use this as my opportunity to quit. Bought nicotine patches and a disposable ecig just in case I knew I was going to fuck up, figuring a pull or two on that would be safer than 15 or 20 on a Newport blue 100. But all that said, I didn't really *want* to quit. I just knew I should.

Extraction day rolls around and they tell me to avoid smoking for at least 48 hours. But then they gave me this little gem: they told me if I wasn't going to be able to make it that long, they gave me instructions on how to smoke "safely." I really wish they hadn't because of course that's all I could think about. I made it 18 hours before I caved, shoved some gauze into my mouth, trimmed the filter down, and took light drags. Now, I will say I'm smoking *less* (6 cigarettes versus 20) but I just... What the fuck is wrong with me? What is so important about these filthy things that I'd risk getting such a painful condition (dry socket) just for a nicotine fix? I'm disgusted with myself.

But on the bright side, this disgust has finally put me in the mindset to quit. I actually *want* to now. I've got 8 cigarettes in my pack left. I'm going to further taper down over the next 2 days and then I'm done. I don't want to be a smoker anymore. Wish me luck. And if anyone has any tips, I'm all ears!

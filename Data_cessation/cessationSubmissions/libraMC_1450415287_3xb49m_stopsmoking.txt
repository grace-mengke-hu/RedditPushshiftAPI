For the last time, I quit!

I'm 18 years old and have tried to quit several times, I am writing this to remind myself (and others) to NOT SMOKE!

My mother and my big sister are both addicted to cigarettes, my father has been and both my grandmothers are also addicted.

When I was a kid I never wanted to start smoking and I didn't think it was cool, when I was 13 I didn't really care about it and on my 16th birthday my stepbrother challenged me to smoke my first cigarette.
 
I accepted the challenge, although I didn't know what challenge was truly awaiting me back then.

From then on I smoked irregularly, sometimes a lot (especially when going out) and sometimes I went days without smoking. In march I started smoking between 7 and 12 cigarettes a day and since then I've tried to quit a couple times. This summer I managed to go five weeks without, but that was only meant as a break, so I could start smoking only a little bit again. This didn't work out at all, as I started again I smoked between 10 and 15 cigarettes a day on weekdays and on fridays/saturdays sometimes 30! So again I've tried to quit a couple times, one time it lasted for a day, one time for a week and most recently I didn't smoke for four weeks.
 
But then I've had a tough time with my girlfriend and immediatly after a fight I bought papes, filters and tobacco. Everything's fine again with my girlfriend, but I still smoke(d) and I want to change that.
 
I just woke up and instead of smoking my good morning cigarette I wrote this post! Today marks my first day without smoking!

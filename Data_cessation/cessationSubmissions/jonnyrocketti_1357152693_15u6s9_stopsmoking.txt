My cartoonist friend is drawing robot comics to help people quit smoking in the New Year.

My buddy is trying to quit smoking after 19 years. He's been drawing robot cartoons to help him focus. He made a robot web comic about his attempts to quit smoking. Check it out [here.] (http://www.healthline.com/health/quit-smoking/bryan-bruner)

I told him he should make a robot drawing for the top commenter in this thread. So go ahead, share your story and submit a photo. Most upvoted comment at 6pm EST gets a free robot cartoon.

You can see one he made for me [here](http://i.imgur.com/g6U1k.jpg) based on [this photo](http://static.tumblr.com/db1c6ab/kwalq6n78/capture.jpg).

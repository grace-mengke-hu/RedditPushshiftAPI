60 days. Just saying thanks.

Feeling pretty good at 60 days smoke free. Thanks for the help offered to me here. It really has made a difference. 

It's been said by better folks than me, but hang in there if you're just quitting. I only offer this, be resolute, be very resolute, it will cut short your pain.

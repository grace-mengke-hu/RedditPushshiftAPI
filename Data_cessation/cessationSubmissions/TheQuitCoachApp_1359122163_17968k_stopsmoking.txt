Stop Smoking App Survey

Hey guys/gals,

I know there are thousands of quit smoking mobile apps out there; however, many are fairly basic and offer mostly stats on money saved, life expectancy etc...  While these are great tools to have when trying to quit there are areas of improvement.  

I am part of a development team trying to create an app that is more than just a stats tool, but one that offers a lot of functionality and is a lot more personalized than traditional apps out there.  There are still a few questions we need answers too before we move into development in a couple weeks and would appreciate any and all feedback from filling out this quick 10 question survey.  http://svy.mk/VsnQRY

Also any feedback in comments on apps you have used and liked/disliked would be appreciated too.  We really do want to create something that has value.  Thanks all.

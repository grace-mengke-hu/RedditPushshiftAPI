Taking the plunge starting tonight.

I won't make this long, but here it goes. I've been a smoker for about 3 years, and at age 25 I'm simply done with the awful things that come along with smoking. From smokers cough in the morning, to constantly being congested, and the terrible smell. My girlfriend recently decided to quit, and she's been 100% nicotine free for 7 weeks now. She sounds much better and I can tell she is happier...now I want that for myself.

I'm lucky to have a loving girlfriend and family, whom never pressured me into quitting on their terms, but rather understood it was a decision I had to make for myself. Now I'm ready to do it. Going cold turkey here guys, so excuse me if I post alot here! Wish me luck!

Long time quitter, noticing the pattern of new quitters...

The are for the most part desperate to quit without wanting to put much effort in.

just noticing the initial posts are all very similar, they are desperate to know how to quit, to get any tips to get rid of the drug.

Thought that was interesting. i think there is something in every smoker that wants to quit.

I am finally ready to quit for good!

Hey guys! I am here because I need to change. I am 31 (almost 32) and I have been smoking on and off since I was 16 and heavily since I was about 20. I need to quit because smoking is gross and unhealthy but right now I need to quit SOON because I am battling a pretty aggressive case of pre-cancer in my cervix and I have been told by everyone that smoking is horrible for that and likely one of the contributing factors.

My friend and my boyfriend have both agreed to quit with me by July 1. In the meantime I will be cutting down: no smoking in the car for starters. I commute a decent distance and I will usually have 2-3 cigarettes in the morning before I even get to work. I am also trying to find a new job and I don't want to make a bad impression by taking smoke breaks and smelling like cigarettes.

I am primarily worried about the side effects, specifically the increased appetite and irritability. I am trying to lose 30lbs and I am on medication for clinical depression so I am worried that quitting smoking while being on a restricted calorie diet is going to send me over the edge. I am thinking of talking to my psychiatrist about Chantix but I am also worried about the psychological side effects of that too. Any advice or personal stories are greatly appreciated.

Thanks!

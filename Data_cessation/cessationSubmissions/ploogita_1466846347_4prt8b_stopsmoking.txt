130 days of supposedly not smoking. I relapsed on the second month.

So I quit smoking sometime around February. Today was supposed to be my 130th day being smoke free (accdg to my flair) but I relapsed on April because my BF and I had a huge fight and I went to a gathering with friends. 3 of my friends smoke. They didn't know I was having troubles with my relationship and they didn't offer me a cig because they were well aware that I quit 2 months ago that time.


I grabbed a cigarette. I wasn't at all pressured into smoking one, but I did anyway. I thought it would make me feel better. It didn't. After that, it became an everyday habit again.


The thing is, I'm not a big sharer of problems or troubles. I think that's why I picked up smoking in the first place. People say it's their outlet, so I made it mine as well. As early as...17 years old?


I think my biggest excuse for smoking is my job. I'm a writer, so every time I'm stuck on a piece of article, I go out for a smoke. In truth, it never really helps. Smoking is the only bad habit I have. I don't drink alcohol, nor do I do drugs.


The only time I don't smoke is when my BF is around. He doesn't smoke and has always frowned upon my bad habit. He doesn't, never had one, but he's been extremely understanding. He knows I tried to quit for 2 months, and he knows I relapsed. I feel quite guilty, to be honest. I feel like I let him down.



It sucks. But I'm thinking of quitting again today. It's a quarter to 5 pm, and I've already had four sticks. I'm afraid I'll have to go through the whole process of getting sick again while my lungs push out all the gunk that smoking left. Ugh. 


Anyway, here's what did help me quit that might help out new quitters here. 



-Don't bother about the date. People tend to quit on Mondays or the firsts of anything because they like the idea of starting fresh on a fresh week, month, or year. If you want to quit, there's no better time to do it than now.



-Try to keep it to yourself for the first few days. You wouldn't want to disappoint any more people other than yourself.



-Quit because you want to. Not because someone forced you to. You'll never truly get over this if you're not ready.




-Think of someone you'd want to do it for. You smoke/smoked/smoking because you really don't give a rat's ass about your health. It's the truth. You know all the side effects of smoking, yet chose to embrace it because what the heck, "you know your body best" So think of someone you'd want to do it for instead - a partner, a family member, a friend. I did it for my BF, my future kids, and all the people I'd leave if I end up hitting the grave first. I'm doing it for my BF again.



-If you can't think of anyone, do it for your health. You're going to die. Earlier than you're supposed to. Unless you're supposed to get into a freak accident. We'll never know, but hey. Best be wise.



-Keep an eye on your reddit flair. It's a great way to keep in track of your progress and feel proud that you reached x day. Note: Do not print it out and wear it around the office. Don't ask why not. Just don't.



-Find something else to waste your time with. I have a 3ds, so I replaced smoking with that. Instead of smoking a cigarette, I would throw my 3ds in a hissy fit then eat it.




-Make sure friends who smoke understands your predicament. It will be nice to have a quit-smoking-companion, but don't preach them into quitting. They'll hate you and they'll stone you, except the stones will be lit cigarettes which might not kill you, but annoy you as hell.


-Your co-worker April will ask you to smoke a cigarette with her. And she'll tell you she'll buy you ice cream if you join her. Say yes to the ice cream, but no to the cigarette. Better gain weight with ice cream than lose it because you're sick and coughing blood. The point is, don't give in to the temptation. Avoid April if you must.




Okay. Good luck..................to us all.

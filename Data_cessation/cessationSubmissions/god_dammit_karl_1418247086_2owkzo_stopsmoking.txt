realised I need to stop after a half 2 walk to the shop for cigs.

So I've never though of myself as addicted... as in I've always been able to go for days without smoking and just want a cig when drinking on the weekend really, which is the same as a lot of my friends. Over the past few months I have been smoking more regularly though having maybe 1 or 2 a day as I've been injured and not been able to do sport. So I've decided to cut it all out and start focusing on the gym and improving fitness. Probably not the most interesting story but this is my story on why I'm stopping. Also I'm also 22 and graduating in a year or so and it's more attractive for a potential girlfriend and employer, especially because I want to be working in labs which will means I'll be in a controlled environment for 4h+

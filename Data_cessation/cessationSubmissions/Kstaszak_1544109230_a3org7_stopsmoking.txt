Day..... 17

Today almost was a start over for me, I was so ready to say screw it and try smoking again.... then I remembered my last experience and how I couldnt even ingest more then 3 puffs....... fuck, this means I'll have to go through smoking training school again.... no thanks.... so I started listening to allen carr audiobooks cuz I'm sick of this back and forth mind game I'm playing with myself.... I feel like a crazy person. The cravings r nonexistent but I still think about smoking a few times each day..... I hate having triggers the ones that still get me r, right after meals, and starting the car.... and sometimes when I make a big deal about cleaning the whole house.... the triggers r just going to take some time u guess..... I'm delaying getting up cuz I'm hungry, and I dont want to eat because of the trigger that follows...

My nonsmoker girlfriend (we're 22f) got diagnosed with stage 3 melanoma and I still can't quit.

I feel like a shitty excuse for a human being. I go from holding her hair back as she pukes thanks to treatment to popping outside for a smoke.

I smoke in my car (never when she's in it) and I can't help but blame myself for contributing to this. She has a genetic predisposition (this is cancer diagnosis number four) and I knew that I shouldn't have exposed her to any of this.

If she dies I will never forgive myself and I'll most likely commit suicide. The only thing that would keep me alive would be her 18mo son (who I've also exposed to carcinogens)

NINJA EDIT: The kicker is that I'm also a nursing student. I hate myself.

Realizing that you're saving ~1 cent every minute of every day

It's my nth time quitting since yesterday. I used to get this brand that was around $18 for 25. I didn't even smoke a pack a day, and the money I was throwing away for the past four years was ridiculous. 

It really does all add up after you quit.

Bloating anyone? Serious question.

I quit a little over a month ago, and all was hunky dory until a few days ago when I experienced severe bloating in my stomach. Quite a few bouts of upper abdominal pain as well. 
And now, a week later, I still have that bloated stomach. A quick search on google with "bloating after quitting smoking" reveals a lot of articles and discussion boards like those of steadyhealth.com. And they seem to be having the exact same problem. Anyone here had something similar ? And if so, how did you get past that? 
I am reading that smoking cigarettes instantaneously removes this bloating and I am quite tempted but I know that I won't. I am just desperate and embarrassed with this gassy problem, and an incredible urge to burp all the time.  Help please.

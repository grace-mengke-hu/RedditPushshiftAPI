1 day shy of 40 days without nicotine...would still love to have a smoke though!

Damn, it just creeps up on you sometimes, doesn't it?  Like others have said here, scumbag brain tells you that it'd be great to light one up with this morning coffee, sit on the porch, and aaaahhhhh...exhale.  Mmm, that's gonna taste so good, give you that familiar buzz you've been missing, right?  C'mon, let's go buy a pack & start up today!

Fucking guy.  Not all the time but sometimes he just sneaks that in there, tries to convince me that it's not that bad, that I can smoke as long as I want, look at everyone else who does it!  Dammit!  Shut.  The. Fuck. Up.  So annoying sometimes.  Catches me unawares & tries it's best to get me to slip back into that comforting addiction rather than fight this everyday.

*end rant*
Phew.  Better.

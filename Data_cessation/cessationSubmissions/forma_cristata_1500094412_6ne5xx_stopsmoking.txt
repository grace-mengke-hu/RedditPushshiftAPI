Cant seem to quit

Ive had the same battle youve all had quitting then starting, quitting then starting. I can't seem to make myself WANT to quit. I like the way I feel and they fit my style (I know it is dumb). But at the same time I hate being stuck to something, and smoking takes so much time, and I am always tired, and I wheeze at night. How have you all found to learn to love not smoking MORE than smoking? I still treat them as a reward, even when I have quit for months.

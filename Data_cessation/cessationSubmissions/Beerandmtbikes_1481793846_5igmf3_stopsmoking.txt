48 Hours and a nasty flu

Got to 48 hours and from yesterday i am having a fever and sore throat.It is strange to think that normally i would smoke even with a sore throat,barely being able to swallow.
So far so good,but i am concerned that the cravings will hit hard after the flu passes.

Thank you all for your awesome support!

Started E-Ciggs to assist Quitting

Been reading up on E-Ciggs and how it has helped others to quit. over the last week I have gone from 1 pack a day to 1 regular cigg a day. Now I have had an e-cigg (bought a 2pk) for the last 2 days and take hits off of it about once every 2 hours. I am not planning on buying any more reg ciggs or E-Ciggs. The 2pk I have of the E-Ciggs seems to be lasting, I still have not touched the 2nd on in the pk. 
Here's to being successful this time around. :)

18 days ago I gave up diet soda (caffeine). 2 days ago I gave up nicotine.

Just saying hello. I knew, because of experience, if I didn't quit drinking soda, I wouldn't be able to stop smoking. Soda masks the flavor of cigarettes in your mouth. Caffeine and nicotine really compliment each other. 

You know that question, "I wonder what I/my life would be like if..." Well, for me it was "I wonder what I would be like if I actually stopped doing the things I've been wanting to stop doing and feel guilty for doing...every. day." So, I've taken the plunge. 

One of my concerns for quitting smoking is my thyroid. I quit last year for a month. My skin felt like sandpaper no matter how much lotion or natural oils I used. I got depressed. My joints were sore and stiff.  I was tired all the time. Well, I finally have healthy insurance and I have my first appointment on Tuesday. I'm going to see if I can get a blood test done to check my thyroid levels and get on medication. 

Cheers to who we all once were and who we will become!

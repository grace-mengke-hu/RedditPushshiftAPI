Breathing better

I work full-time at a place where I'm quickly going up and down four floors of stairs many times a day and I noticed I'm not gassed or even really breathing out of my mouth at the top of the stairs.

I noticed it last week. I'm really psyched! Its a tangible result and its **really** fucking encouraging! That is all. 💪🏼

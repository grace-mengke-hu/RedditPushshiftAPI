I am absolutely blown away by how quickly I'm getting over a cold!

A little short background on me.  I was a smoker for almost exactly 14 years, basically my entire adult life.  I quit smoking just over a month ago.  Still using an e-cig/vaporizer thingy on a regular basis, but I'm lowering my nicotine levels gradually.  I'm currently on the lowest level available at my local shop.  The next step is no nicotine at all.  

For as long as I can remember I've gotten a cold around this time of year, and this year has been no different in that regard.  It's become something I've just come to accept is going to happen every year.  In the past few years this cold would be in full force for almost two weeks, and I'd be coughing up lung butter for another two weeks after that.  I would usually call off work for a few days when it was at it's worst, I would always lose all sense of taste for about 3 days, and I would be leaking fluids everywhere for most of those first 2 weeks.

Here's where the change comes in.  I only got sick last Thursday, and yeah, I felt like hell for about 3 days.  By Saturday morning I lost my sense of taste, and I was prepared to deal with that for a few days.  But then I was shocked to have it return completely by that evening.  By Sunday I was starting to feel better.  Today (Monday) I'm basically already completely over the cold, and I'm just dealing with the lingering cough from crap that drained into my lungs.  Not only that, it's not even that bad!  

So to put it simply, Every cold I've had in the past few years has taken me nearly a month to fully recover from.  It's been 5 days now since I caught this cold, and the way I feel is how I remember feeling at around week 3 as a smoker.  

Just wanted to share because this experience has only helped to solidify how happy I am to be a non-smoker.

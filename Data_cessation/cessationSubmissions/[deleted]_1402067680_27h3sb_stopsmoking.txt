I really want this...

My story is a little graphic, just a heads up.

Yesterday I realized the day had finally come for me to quit. I had gone out the night before drinking and smoking heavily as I always do only to end up the next day feeling like shit. Not the normal hung over, but the eventual throwing up, shit. The same thing had happened to me about a week or two before. This has never really happened to me. On a night of drinking usually I'm fine. But then I realized it was the tabacco I was using. I had switched to an American Spirit flavor that I really liked, but so much of it in excess mixed with alcohol wasn't good for me. I smoked once yesterday and that's when I realized it was that specific flavor that was making me sick. I realized I had a choice, either change flavors or do what's needed to be done for a long time. After my last smoke at 3:30PM, I knew unless I wanted to spend more mornings puking my brains out that I needed to quit.

I've tried in the passed, used the e-cig and what not with no luck. I realized that I enjoy smoking and that's the hardest battle to overcome. I am using an e-cig to help as I need the nicotine to maintain the balance in my head at work, but it's just not quite the same and my body knows that. So far I've gone 20 hours and I want to keep going. I feel the determination for the first time to really make the effort. I've considered the pros and cons very carefully and I feel that the pros of quitting have finally made more sense. The biggest one being that cigarettes bring temporary relief to a problem. I need to do this. I need to make the effort to quit.

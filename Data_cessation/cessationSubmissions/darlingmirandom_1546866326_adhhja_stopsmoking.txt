Four Months Today, Zero Nicotine.

To anyone out there struggling, don't play the victim - just do the work. This is mega hard, everything is a trigger some days. But damn if it's not ridiculously worth it. I loved smoking, but I've learned I have to love myself more- one day at a time. When I used to think about quitting, I daydreamed about someday reaching where I am right now. And I'm here in my own promised land, finally. My eternal mantra for all things has become: "Whether you can or you can't, you are right" -Henry Ford 
Solidarity with all. Thanks for listening.

TIL the best* reason to quit smoking

Today, I heard my roommate explaining why she didnt't smoke, and that her father used to smoke cigarettes and pot regularly through her early teens.  He finally gave up his habits upon her entrance into h.s. and in doing so, became a complete asshole.  He wasn't selling it to the neighbor kids nor dolling out cigs to punks at the gas station.  He worked hard, provided for and faithfully loved his wife and children. He maintained a high level of consumption of tobacco and mary jane but for all intents and purposes, was a functional addict. Regular Joe much like 69%** of you other addicts on reddit.  
It wasn't that the guy was a prick before he quit, he was actually a friendly and thoughtful dad, albeit one with a borderline drug problem.  
What I'm attempting to communicate here is that the problem was not the drug/s. The problem was his inability to handle his shit. It was using a crutch to smooth out the bumps.  It was that he had never flexed his feel muscle when it came under a load and instead was juicing himself into a blissful ambivalence.  Having a bad morning? Fuck it, smoke a cig.  Boss being a douche? Fuck it, cancer sticks to the rescue!
Migraine from a brutal day at the office? Forget it even happened with some sticky icky to the dome!  
The problem here is that his/my/your use of stimulants and sweet ganja to attend to our mundane daily dilemmas, which will never fucking cease until we are in the dirt btw.
For fucks sake i don't blame her dad for trying, as I am also sruggling to quit, but he should have smoked MORE as his daughter became a young woman, considering his fragile state.  That's like giving up alcohol on a beach for spring break....

Oh yeah...

TIL to stop using drugs and deal with my bullshit problems.

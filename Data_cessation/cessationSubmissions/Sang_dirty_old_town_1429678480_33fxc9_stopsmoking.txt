A year ago today smoking put me in the ER at 25

A year ago I had a tightness under my shoulder, after work sent me to the ER it took them all of 5 minutes to tell me that I had suffered a spontaneous pnuemothorax and it was because I was a smoker. 

So I had a really gnarly chest tube put in, a surgery to fix the hole in my lung , and a few weeks on some very interesting pain meds. But it didn't need to happen. This sub has helped me stay quit, which for me (and for all of us really) is a life or death issue. So I wanted to say thanks to everyone here, for the encouragement of watching so many of you succeed in quitting, staying quit, or starting to quit over again. You guys rock.

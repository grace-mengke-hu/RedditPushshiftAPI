6 weeks - Anxious and emotional?

Symptoms include: light chest tightness, feeling the need to sigh a lot, feeling "emotional" i.e teary but not necessarily sad and feeling anxious more often than I ever have before. 

Is this normal? Have I been supressing something? It's crossed my mind that the dopamine from cigarettes may have blocked out these feelings before, but considering that I felt *less* anxious after quitting the sudden increase again makes me wonder if this is just another stage of withdrawal.

Anyone else going through this?

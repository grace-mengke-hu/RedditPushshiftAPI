I got drunk and didn't smoke!

It's the first weeks smoke-free, so I was pretty concerned about having a drunk time with friends because I was afraid I would relapse. 

It's happened before: I would quit, and then find myself unable to control my urges to smoke while out drinking in the weekends, then make promises to only smoke in weekends, then eventually go back to smoke a pack everyday in about 2 months or so. 

That made me feel this quitting attempt in more "real" than the previous ones. As I've read somewhere, those little wins are the most powerful creators of momentum for real change.

(Also, I'm freaked out by being able to smell again. I passed by food truck selling strongly seasoned stuff today and the smell of herbs and spices hit me like a punch in the face. Just wow.)

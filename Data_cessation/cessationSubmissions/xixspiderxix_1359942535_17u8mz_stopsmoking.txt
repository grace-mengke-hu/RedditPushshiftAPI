fu** fu** fu**

Ok so here we go.  Turned 30 last month and told myself I would quit smoking.  I did it!  I've been cig free for almost a month.  Notice how I said cig?  I moved over to "vape" to get me through.  About 12 hours ago  my vape device broke in my pocket.  I was working on my own regiment of the 24~28mg? of nicotine and was planning on weening myself off by going less and less and less and well you get it.  

For the past 5 hours i've been just wigging out.  My anger is going up and down and taking care of my 7 month old and my wife's problems are just blowing me the fu** up.

Ok so...I just wanted to write this to say daymn....I am mad at myself for letting nicotine ruin me like this, My wife is telling me to go get the patch a cig or whatever to get over the cravings and I went out and picked up a cig and put a lighter in my hand.....but then put it down...I need to quit..No just for me but for my daughter and wife.  

so i'm just venting here...this is FUCKING HARD.  I don't even want the vape now because of how i'm getting the twitches from that crazy crap..so it's cold turky....wish me luck...also..i'm looking for some pro tips.

TL;DR: fu** fu** fu** just like the title says

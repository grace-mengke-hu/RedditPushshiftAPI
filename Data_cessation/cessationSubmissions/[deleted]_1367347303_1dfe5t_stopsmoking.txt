To all of you who thought ''It won't be me".

I can bet that all of you had thought at one point "I'll be one of those people who can smoke a pack a day, and live to 100. After all, my grandmother/grandfather did it'' or "I will only get sick if I continue to smoke for the next X amount of years, I'll be fine for now"

I have been smoking since I was about 14 years old, and now I have been diagnosed with a heart condition that will effect me for the rest of my life, and eventually lead to heart failure. 
..At the ripe old age of 20. All due to smoking.

I always thought that the health problems associated with smoking will open happen to me when I'm over 60, and thats if I still smoke then.

The surprising thing is that I don't even smoke that much, about a 1/3 of a pack a day, yet I have been given the misfortune of a pussy of a heart, thanks to smoking. Not genetics, not a bad diet, ALL because of smoking. But now alas it is time for me to stop before it quite literally kills me, and I really hope that you can do it too.

So next time you see "smoking kills" or a mangled set of tar ridden lungs on your packet don't shrug it off and say ''It won't be me", I used to think the same, and now it is me. Instead realise that if you continue to be a slave to the master in your pocket, it will be your demise.

I'm not looking for gold, I'm not looking for karma, I just want to serve as a living, breathing reminder that if you want to see your kids graduate, and play with your grandchildren one day, you have to stop now. and I mean NOW.

Remember that growing old is a privilege denied to many of us, so grab smoking by the balls and say NO MORE.

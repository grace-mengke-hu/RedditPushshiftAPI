Day 1 Almost done with work.

Since my colleague decided to stop I was like fuck it I'll join, did it pretty much cold turkey since I still smoked like 10 cigs yesterday, but have a blithering headache now and the crave is bad. Any tips for what to do during these moments? Will use this sub to update every day since I believe it will help me taking this serious/keeping me motivated. At least I'm already  happy I got through this day of work without smoking one :)

Thanks in advance guys!

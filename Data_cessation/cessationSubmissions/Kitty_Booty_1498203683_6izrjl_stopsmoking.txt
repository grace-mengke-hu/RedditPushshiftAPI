Sneezing Side Effect?

I quit cold turkey two weeks ago now and I noticed a weird quirk develop as soon as I quit. Every time I have a coughing fit, I sneeze. Any one else experience something weird like this upon quitting? Very odd. Also any advice on how fall out of love with the idea of smoking? I no longer have a true urge, but I miss sitting outside and enjoying the sunset or breeze and smoking. Or smoking with a cup of coffee. Little things like that.

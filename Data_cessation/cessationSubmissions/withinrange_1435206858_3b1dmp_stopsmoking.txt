Stop smoking, breakups, relationship fiasco(s)

I won't bore you with all the backstory but the person I broke up with last month just emailed me to let me know they are going for surgery for a few days about a week from now. Biopsy, then surgery.

And I wrote back and told them to suck a dick. 

I mean that is pretty much what I said, and, "have a nice surgery".

I'm just saying it out loud here; I see it looks very rude. But I'm not sorry for it. And I guess this is my way of saying, on day 23 of not smoking, I am ok not being nice AT ALL to a person I loved for six years.

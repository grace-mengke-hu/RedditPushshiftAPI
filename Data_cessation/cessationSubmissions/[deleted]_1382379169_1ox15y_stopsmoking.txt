Day 1 (God help me!)

I decided yesterday that I was done with smoking. On Saturday, I smoked my usual morning cigarette. I had been feeling a bit off the night before, and smoking in the morning, which normally woke me up and mentally prepared me for the day left me feeling sick. In fact, violently ill. I started throwing up and felt ill for the majority of the day bleeding into Sunday. I tried smoking several times during this time period, which didn't work out too well. Yesterday, I smoke half a cigarette in the morning, half in the evening, and decided I couldn't handle it anymore. I plunged the last pack I had under the sink and threw them in the trash. I was going to be fine. So I thought.

I've quit before. I quit once for a whole six months, cold turkey. It was during the summer when my stress levels were relatively low.

I am currently in my first year of graduate school in a fairly tense work environment. I am incredibly hard on myself and used smoking as a way to hush all of the negative thoughts I suffer from on a daily basis. I am sitting in the research lab I work in and chewing on gobstoppers while finding it increasingly more impossible to focus on anything. 

I don't want to do this anymore. Hell, my research is focused on finding inhibitors of pathways linked to cancer. I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired, but right now I feel like ripping my hair out. Help!

August 27th is my quit date

Hi everyone. I’ve lurked here for awhile and tomorrow is my quit date (or I guess technically today since it’s 12am where I live). I just threw away my cigarettes and lighters and ashtrays and suddenly I’m feeling extremely anxious already. Thought I’d come here for support. It’s going to be a long journey, but I’m tired of slowly killing myself and smelling gross all the time. 

Thanks for reading, everyone. Today is day 1!

I want to give my mom incentive to quit; I am desperate. Here's my idea:

Recently, I got news that an old acquaintance's mom had passed away from some form of lung disease. She was a smoker for about ten years.

My mom's been smoking for over 20 years. 

I know that she's stressed and has anxiety, so I try not to be too hard on her about it. But really, I'm at my wits-end. I've tried many different forms of persuasion. This summer, we made a deal: By the time I get my Bachelors degree, she quits smoking.

However, I don't know if I can depend on her to hold up her part of the bargain.

**So here's my idea.**

I'm going to tell her that if she doesn't stop smoking in 30 days, then I'm going to **start** smoking.

I know for a fact that my sister and I are the most precious things in this world to her. And the last thing she wants to see is one of her kids slowly deteriorating their own health. 

I understand this sounds stupid, and contradictory. And honestly, maybe it is. That's why I came here. I need feedback, or better ideas, stories, or **something**.

I love my mom, and I want more than anything for my future kids to have a relationship with her. She deserves a long, healthy life. 

I am desperate and scared.

**Please, I just need some feedback**.

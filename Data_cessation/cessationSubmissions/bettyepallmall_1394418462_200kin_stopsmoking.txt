What else can I do?

I've read that book, Stop Smoking the easy way... it really helped to change my mind about how I feel about smoking, but I feel I don't have enough willpower to actually do it. (He says its not willpower, but I don't see what else it could be.) I've also tried vaping which worked for the first week or so - I was pretty proud of myself for "quitting" but one day my battery broke and it took about a week before I was able to get another one. This, of course, led me back to smoking and also led me to the realization that I'd never really quit. I just had a substitute. I've tried cold turkey, which I say lasted for 3 days but in reality I smoked a cigarette before bed each of those 3 days and by day 4 I just gave in completely. 

My boyfriend is a pack a day smoker, just like me. My grandfather, my dad, my brother, my aunts, my cousins.... All smoke. That's our family get-togethers,  we sit around on my grandma's huge porch, drink coffee, smoke cigarettes, and talk. 

I don't want my kids to smoke but I know if me and my boyfriend continue they will. There is no doubt in my mind, I know they will. I have to stop. But I don't know how. I'm mostly venting my frustration but also looking for guidance. It seems so scary.

4 Days in and I want to say thanks!

I've been smoking about 14 cigarettes a day for 3 years (18) and this is the longest I've gone cold turkey since I got addicted. The cravings suck, Im bitchy, and i haven't slept all that often but I'm consistently motivated thanks in part to the community in this sub. Instead of smoking on my breaks I open up this sub and read the success stories and the advice/tips on how to stay smoke free! 

I have found throughout this process I've been relying more and more on this sub as a motivating tool to keep me on my path. I'm back into my favorite combat sport (Muay Thai), my girlfriend and I broke up (the relationship was a big stresser), and I truly feel like quitting was the first step to a longer, healthier life. I honestly don't think I could've gone this far without seeing your guys' support in this sub and I thank all of you for your continued support of fellow addicts. I hope it makes you guys feel good that you've (hopefully) saved a young man from the grips of tobacco addiction, I know it makes me feel good :)

Any other tips for a newly quit smoker? Thinking of picking up Allen Carrs book, seems to help many. 
Also any motivating words or stories of your guys' quitting process would be greatly appreciated I love hearing them! They help me get through the day cig free!

Thank you guys! 
Sincerely, Healthy Ringworm

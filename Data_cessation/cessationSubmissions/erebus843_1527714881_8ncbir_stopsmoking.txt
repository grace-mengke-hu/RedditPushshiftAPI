Today was tough, but I'm sticking with it.

Today I reallly felt it. Kind of a shitty morning. Didn't sleep very well, woke up annoyed. Girlfriend gave me my space and was probably (ok, definitely) glad my grumpy ass left for work. Speaking of work, I'm super bored. Not much to do today. And I'm exhausted.

Today was the first time in 12 days I really missed smoking. The thought of going down the street from my office to get a pack crossed my mind. Nothing too serious, but that little tug was there. It didn't go away right away either. Old me would have wanted nothing more than to go home early, pour a bourbon neat, and sit on the patio with a fresh pack of Marlboro ultra lights and decompress.

But I'm not. I recognize what's happening. My body and mind are looking for that nicotine. I think they're catching on to the fact it's been a while, and will be forever. 

So... I'm not going to smoke today. I'm not going to bum one off a co-worker or buy a pack just to have one or two. I'm not going to go home and be all grumpy with my girlfriend. I'll tell her what's up and she'll say, "Okay, I'll leave you alone. Let me know when you're feeling better." I'm not going to be annoyed by little things. Most importantly, I'm not going to smoke. This, too, shall pass.

I am, however, going to have that bourbon neat when I get home.  :)

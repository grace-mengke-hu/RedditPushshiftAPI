Lightheaded all the time!

Right, I’m hoping some of you can shed some light on this. 
I have been constantly lightheaded now for a LONG time, the best way to describe it is the lightheadedness you get from smoking. Yes I smoke. The reason for my asking my question is I also at times suffer from anxiety but I’m sure it’s because of the lightheadedness that I am anxious. 

My question is this, is it the smoking and the chemicals and nicotine with in that is making my feel like this. It is constant. 

I also get out of breath very quickly, even when talk. I’m not over weight. 

I’ve had blood tests: clear. MRI: clear. ECG: fine. 

Final thing, yes I am stopping smoking as of today, I’m using Allan’s carts easy way. 

I’m just so conflicted as my doctors say it’s anxiety but I know my body. 

Thank you very much.

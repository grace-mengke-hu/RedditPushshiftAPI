Encouraging story for those trying to quit

My mom had smoked from the age of 12. She smoked for over 40 years. She had tried quitting many times before, but always went back to it. All the kids in my family had just gotten used to it. I used to joke to my friends that I was a "second hand smoker." But on my little sister's 18th birthday, my mom asked her what she wanted. She said, "I want you to quit smoking," and so my mom agreed... again. "But Mom," my sister said, "you need to remember something. You have never taken a birthday present back."

My sister is now 30 years old, and my mom is still holding to her promise.

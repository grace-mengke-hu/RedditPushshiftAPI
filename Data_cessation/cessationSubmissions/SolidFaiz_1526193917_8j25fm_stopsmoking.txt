I need to stop

I’m a slave to my addiction. 
Today I went out of bed at 1:30 to buy cigarettes. It’s 3;30 and I smoked around 4 - 5 cigarettes.
My son knows I smoke and cried when he caught me doing it. Last week he told me to stop it, because if I keep doing it he will do i to and that’s he wants to be like me(exactly his words). Imagine your 4 year old son telling you that.

In my defense I’m a good and loving father. However this is my biggest flaw and it’s messing with me, but also taking its toll on my health (smokers cough). 

I’m going to stop today and all of your support is appreciated.

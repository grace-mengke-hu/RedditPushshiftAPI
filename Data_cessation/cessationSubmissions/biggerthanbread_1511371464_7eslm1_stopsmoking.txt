Trying to stop

First time poster.  I started when I was about a sophomore in high school strictly out of boredom and having to walk everywhere.  It was just something to occupy my time and now itâ€™s become an full blown addiction.  Never really had any intentions of stopping until now.  Anyone out there got any quick tips for how to cut down/stop entirely?

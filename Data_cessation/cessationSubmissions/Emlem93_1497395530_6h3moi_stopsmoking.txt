1 month today!

So I've been a month today with out smoking and I'm so chuffed with myself. Was a 30 a day smoker so was pretty dependant and had a habit of chain smoking, I genuinely thought it would be a lot harder than it has been but overall it's been quite easy, obviously have had some bad days for example about 3 days ago I just wanted to snatch cigarettes out of people's hands and smoke them lol! But will power is stronger than the craving! I am absolutely loving my clothes and hair not stinking, also visiting the shops for cigs religiously. I am finally seeing myself as a non smoker, so now that it's been a month, I felt I wanted to share my success. 
And to anyone giving up, I want to send strength and will power, you can do this, if I can do this anyone can!!

Stellar book - keeping me on track and motivated!

I feel like I got a hold of this book at just the right moment. Super easy to read, interesting examples, and now I REALLY GET why 'not one puff, ever again' is so important. Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg. Check out the keystone habit idea, and see where you can go with your quit as a start. *Title hyperlink takes you to an excerpt from the book.

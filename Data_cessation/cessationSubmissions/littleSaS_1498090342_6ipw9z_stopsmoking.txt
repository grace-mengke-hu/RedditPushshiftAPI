90 days in and I can ride my bike without busting a lung.

On the weekend I fixed my bike, which has been sitting forlorn, in the backyard for over a year. I took it for a test ride on Saturday night - walked it to the nearest garage to fill the tyres and rode it home a couple of k's. Felt pretty good.

Tuesday I did my yoga and still had a bit of time before work so I jumped on the bike. I made it around the local parkrun track (5 kilometres) and could have done more if I'd had time. 

Slow and steady wins the race. I''m starting to feel a bit of pride in this old girl's progress this year!

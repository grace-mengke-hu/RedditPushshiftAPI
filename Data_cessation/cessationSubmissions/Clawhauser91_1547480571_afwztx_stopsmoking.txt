So its been a week

I had a slip and smoked half a cigarette before realising what i was doing but Still, i’ve reached a week. Finding it easier when I’m at work, out with friends etc, but I’m so much happier, i feel better and have more energy. I’m back at the gym as well and generally just feeling better about myself. 

I just wanted to say thanks as well to everyone as its been a really help knowing I’m not alone and other people hints and tips are helping too. 

So yeah, thats all. Week one ✅

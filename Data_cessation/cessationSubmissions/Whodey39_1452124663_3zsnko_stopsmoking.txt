48 hours in and...

I can tell you my house smells like crap. It reeks of cigerettes. I never noticed it before today, I went to be last night and woke up and it's like it hit me first thing this morning? Is that what I smelled like all the time??? I quit cold turkey a couple days ago and it's not been easy but the smell of my clothes and my house is gross. Anyone else go through this?

Relapsed

At the age of 16 I started smoking and I smoked until I quit at 20. I'm now 25 and last month was... Hard. I won't give a sob story but basically I had a chance to bum a cigarette after some really bad news, so I did. And I did the next day. And the next. Then I bought a pack. Smoked it in a little over a week, only at work. Got a second pack and found myself sneaking away at home or when I was out of the house to have a smoke. I think my S/O knew, though. I got my third pack today after swearing to myself I wouldn't buy one. I smoked FOUR cigarettes in an 8 hr shift today. I realized what the fuck I was doing and threw the rest of the pack in the trash. In less than a month I picked up that awful habit and I'm putting it back down.

I don't want to die young, I don't want my kids to beg me to stop smoking like how I did. I don't want to be out of breath and coughing while being intimate with my S/O.

I wish I never smoked that first cigarette.

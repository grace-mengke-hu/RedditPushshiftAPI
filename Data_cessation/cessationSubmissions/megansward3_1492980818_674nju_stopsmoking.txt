110 Hours

I'm 4.5 days smoke free-110 hours. I'm 24 and have been smoking since I was 14.... Stupid, stupid.. I wish I could go back and tell myself not to do it and that it's not worth it. But.. I can't, so all I can do is move forward from here. I'm ashamed of my smoking mostly.. I'm constantly spraying myself down with perfume.. leaving my windows down in the car to air it out, making my son and husband wait in the car while I have my cigarette before we go somewhere or leave some place.. I hate the way it tastes and smells, the fact that it's my first thought when I wake up.. my first thought after a meal, what I run to no matter what emotion I'm feeling. Pissed? Smoke a cigarette. Happy? Smoke a cigarette. Sad? Smoke a cigarette. Nervous? Smoke a cigarette. These damn things, I've stood in the rain to smoke, I've stood in the heat and the snow... I'm done. It's like burning my money & watching the smoke just float away. I said and I thought I would never let anything control me. But I did, well not anymore. I'm done.

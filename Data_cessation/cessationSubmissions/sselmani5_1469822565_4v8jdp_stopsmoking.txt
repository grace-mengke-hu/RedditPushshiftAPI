3weeks smoke free

I have been smoking for 11 years or so. I am a 26 year old male. And i have been thinking of quitting for 2 years of quitting but the mental block is like a brick wall i also thought about life and my family my wife and my 8month son as one of the main reasons for quitting. 

But most importantly "Health" 

I decided to quit after i got food poisoned (witch sucks, i need to write another thread about that) i got scared when i was feeling the food poisoning symptoms so immediately said to my self enough is enough!

In the 3rd day of quitting i had headaches cigarette cravings.
But with that being said my mental side was so strong that nothing would bring me back to smoking no matter what!

In my process of quitting i have been tested multiple times a day as all the people i know smoke, but that is not the problem is i am so headstrong about quitting.

But my main problem is my body physically, in my 21st day since quitting i keep getting constant upper left chest pressure, tingleling in the hands and feet, body feeling weak, sweating sometimes.

But i am not craving cigarettes, I'm just feeling these tiring symptoms i went to my doctor and she prescribed me Xanax 0.25mg witch do relax my body but i dont know how long this will go on for anyone else going through this?

Please reply below anyone experiencing this or if anyone knows some more information i would deeply appreciate it

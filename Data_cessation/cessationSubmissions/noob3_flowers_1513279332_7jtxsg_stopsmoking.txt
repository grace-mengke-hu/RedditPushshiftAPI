So at night, I've been quitting at night. I run out, and I tell myself I won't buy a pack in the morning.

and then I wake up, and the first thing I do when I leave for work is buy a pack of cigarettes. I've been smoking since I was 17, so for 14 years now.. Gosh. I don't know why I can't avoid it &gt;_&lt; If I have them, when I wake up - I will smoke one within 5 minutes. 

I have no breath for sports, I feel cold, I have high blood pressure and sometimes at night I will wheeze :/ and I am worried if I quit smoking, that I will gain weight. lol

gosh I just need some encouragement :[ or something :[ sick of it

A progress update

Ill keep it short. I never smoked a ton, at my worst I would be smoking 5 a day. I've managed to cut myself down to about .20/day. Now im desperately trying not to do it at all. I can stomach a few days or even two weeks without a smoke without any cravings, but after a while the idea of a cigarette becomes very appealing. The smells of tobacco, that brief relaxed nicotine buzz that I get, that smoke flavour in the back of my throat.

And then immediately afterwards I regret it.

I've been at this phase of single cigarette or two a week for 2 months.

Distraction tips?

I’m determined to quit smoking, I’ve set my quit date for just after my birthday next week, turning 22 and been smoking for almost 7 years (ugh)

Here’s where I’m asking for advice: I’m overweight. And I know a lot of people gain weight after quitting smoking because of habits and eating to take your mind off the cravings. So how have you distracted yourself from smoking and snacking? What are your favourite/best methods for getting over the cravings?

I ask this before I quit so I can prepare myself for the cravings, because I think they’re going to be horrible (I know how I reacted after a 6 hour flight and it wasn’t fun at all)

So tried and tested distractions welcome! Thanks everyone!

8 weeks, no change

It’s been 8 weeks since I touched any nicotine. The cravings never stop and today I feel like i might not survive without some. When does this stop? It’s been 2 years since another addiction and I still think about that too...

I’m currently knitting to take my mind off of it. But it hurts.

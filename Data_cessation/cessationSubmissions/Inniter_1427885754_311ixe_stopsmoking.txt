Cheers lovely people

Hey guys

Hit day nine today and finding cravings much harder to deal with over the past couple of days. Almost to the point of cracking a couple of times. Never really had problems during the first week and always tend to find the second week the hardest. Feels like depression and lack of sleep have been gradually grinding me down and my willpower is fading. I know it's only on me to not be defeated by this addiction and I fully intend on kicking it in the dick! 

It's at this point I usually check this board when I'm alone and tempted to have a sneaky cig. Reading others' stories and the kind responses never fail to help focus me and on why I'm going through the difficulties and how much it's worth it.

I usually just lurk but wanted to post a quick thank you to everyone here that contributes to this board. I could easily have imagined myself smoking over the past days if it wasn't for this board giving me a little inspiration during the worst cravings. 

Cheers

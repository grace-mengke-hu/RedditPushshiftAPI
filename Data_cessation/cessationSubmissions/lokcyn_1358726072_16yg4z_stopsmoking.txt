After 25 yrs.: No unusual struggles being a non-smoker, but I have a few questions

When I smoked 1-2 packs per day, I coughed up phlegm throughout the day. When I decreased to 1 pack every 2-3 days, I coughed less. By the time I began reading Allen Carr's book, I limited myself to 5 cigarettes per day and halfway into the book I smoked 3 per day until last Tuesday when I smoked my last cigarette that evening. While I do cough, I expected my lungs to become way more productive after 25 years of smoking and they have not. I cough no more now than I did as a light smoker.
---Should I concern myself if I am not coughing very much?
I have noticed my sense of smell and taste have changed dramatically. I am discovering that nearly everything tastes new to me and my appetite has decreased because of it. 
---Any recommendations regarding rediscovering foods as a non-smoker and how you retained your appetite/ got adequate calories?

1 year!

When I stopped smoking, I was skeptical if I'll actually make this far. Looking back now, time just flew by. It has been an interesting journey so far. 

I only have a vague memory of the strong cravings during the initial 3 weeks.
After that it has been very easy not to smoke. It is so fun to learn to break those associations. Breaking the easier associations like coffee, before-poop, driving and also breaking the difficult ones like wake-up smoke, drinking smoke etc,. I feel like I have learnt a new life which nicotine was hiding away from me. 

My life doesn't revolve around making plans for the next smoke anymore. I have lost 60 lbs in the last year, eat clean, hit the gym regularly, bettered my sleep cycle, going to run my first 5k in 2 weeks. 

I hope this post inspires/motivates atleast 1 person with their quitting journey. If I can do it, anyone can do it. I was that in an overall pathetic place last year. And all my holistic improvements are based on 1 habit - no smoking. 

All the very best friends! We got this. Here's to a lifelong no smoking journey.

Please advise - questions about Allen Carr/ Easyway

Ok, here's the deal. Several years back I quit by reading Allen Carr's EasyWay to Quit Smoking. It worked like a charm - I was just blown away.  I stayed quit for 2 years, then at a party stupidly thought 'Oh, I can just have one." You know where that lead. :(

Long story short, I have read and re-read the book at least 6 times over the past few years. GAHHHH I will quit, then start again, like an idiot.  Unfortunately, this once great book has now become watered-down to me, if that makes sense.

I really do want to quit. Do you think watching the webcast of the EasyWay method would work? I love his way, it is the best. But I'm wondering if just a different media (same material, though) would work. And it's not cheap.

Has anyone else read his book 'too' many times?

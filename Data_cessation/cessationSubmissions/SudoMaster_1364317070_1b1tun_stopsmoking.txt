1 week baby!

It's been a week and 1 day now and I'm feeling great about quitting.  This time around is definitely much easier and I think it's because of my state of mind.  I have given it up completely in my mind. I've had the occasional craving but nothing that I couldn't handle.  I have been smoking trees once in a while but I mean... that's allowed right? :D

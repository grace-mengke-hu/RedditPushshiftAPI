SO frustrated...need advice. (Long but could really use input)

I'm 30 and smoked a pack and a half a day from age 15-26.  Quit for almost 4 years before starting up this past year due to the most stressful circumstances of my life, and have recently been trying to quit again cold turkey.  

Had my last cigarette on Christmas night and despite battling some intense cravings (I have a child with severe special needs and also a toddler, my life is pretty much always high-stress) I thought I was doing okay.  Then the tooth pain started.

I tried ibuprofen in high doses, ice packs and even started an antibiotic.  No relief.  This morning I broke down and smoked half of a cigarette (that I didn't even want) because I was so desperate to relieve the pain and I'll be damned if it didn't work.  WTF?  I have googled this endlessly and can't really find any answers.  I have never had good teeth, but I've gotten a lot of work done on them the past year and as of last month all I needed was one cavity filled.  How could ALL of my teeth possibly hurt this bad just from quitting smoking?!

I really thought I could do it this time and I am SO frustrated.  I have two children to care for and can't spend any more time sitting around sobbing on the couch holding an ice pack on my mouth.  I am snowed in right now and my dentist is 30 miles away.  

I WILL get to the dentist this week, but seriously...what in the hell?  Has ANYONE had this happen?

Hello, New Years quitters!

I know a lot of people will be turning to this sub at the start of the new year, so I wanted to post here something folks have found helpful. I posted a few years ago [how I quit smoking three packs a day](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1nfqe1/a_year_ago_today_i_was_a_3packsaday_smoker_a_year/).

This year I also posted [how much I love smoking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/3n26xo/three_years_ago_today_i_was_a_threepacksaday/), so that people would understand that their level of addiction isn't beyond the scope of being able to quit.

Just remember that you CAN do this. Trying to quit, and coming to this sub to find support, are signs that you're already on the right track. You're better than cigarettes! 

Happy new year, quitters. Stay strong. You can do this!

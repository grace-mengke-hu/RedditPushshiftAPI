Every time I smoke I feel a bit weaker inside.

I (26M) have been smoking since I was 15 (tried to quit plenty of times since then).  I feel ashamed when someone finds out that I do, and like a contradiction because I try to keep fit with the gym and climbing even though I know I’d be be a lot better without it.

My SO (F23) is also a smoker since about 14/15. We met 3 years ago and in the time we’ve been together the conversation has come up about how much better we would be if we didn’t smoke.  I feel that we give in too easily to our cravings Be it smoking, food, etc and have a lot to do in growing a backbone and developing willpower. 

During the week we have about two smokes a day, when I drop her to the train in the morning and when o collect her from the train in the evening. If we go out for drinks it can be a lot. 

I feel our situation is not unique or hopeless but definitely could do with some advice from people who have been in similar situations and are recovering.


Thank you and apologies for the formatting, I’m on mobile.

My first day

I have been smoking since I was 13 (19 now) and I'm the last couple of months I've been going through nearly 5 boxes a week. I was sick of always smelling like cigarettes and putting them before food sometimes. 

I never thought I'd quit because it's such a big part of my life, whenever I walk I smoke, whenever I'm finished eating, I smoke, whenever I'm relaxing I smoke. I had to get a vape as I knew I wouldn't be able to quit cold turkey and I'm doing surprisingly well.

I still am gonna smoke when I drink tho which is kinda bad but definitly not as bad as smoking nearly a pack a day

90 days. Frustrated by obstacles in my life.

Without getting into the heavy details, I’m having critical issues in my relationship and serious setbacks in my graduate school progress. At the end of the day though, I can still always say, at least I have my health. Cigarettes wouldn’t be making this any better. I know the idea of sitting on the bench outside and chain smoking cigarettes while I work on my laptop seems appealing but its just so much harder to allow that in my life. 

I’m very excited for 100 days. Oddly enough, the cigarette dreams have been becoming more frequent, almost nightly. I guess stress is hitting me in weird ways. There’s still little that beats the relief of guilt when I wake up and realize I haven’t smoked though. I just wish life weren’t so stressful right now.

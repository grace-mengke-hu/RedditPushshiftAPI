Input needed!

I stopped smoking 9 days and 4 hours ago. I am using patches. I smoked 20 a day for 12 years! 

I will be lowering my patch after 3 weeks and going on the smaller dose. 

I thought quitting smoking was supposed to give more energy? I sleep with my patch on so my dreams are very vivid. But I do this as because as soon as I wake I would go for a first cigarette! 

I have not had any cravings or felt moody or anything! I have just had a constant headache and felt really tired since about day 3! Any advice as it's driving me mad x

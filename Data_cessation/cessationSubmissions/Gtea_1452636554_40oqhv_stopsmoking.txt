Over 1000 days of being cigarette free!

I wouldn't have thought quitting something would be one of my life's greatest achievements.

For the longest time I had kept a four cigarette a day rule. It felt like I was in control and that health risks would be minimal. As I got older stressful events started to occur more frequently and I began self-medicating with smoking. 4 Cigarettes became 8 and 8 turned to 15. When I seriously thought about quitting was when I began smoking any time I could. The addiction had complete control over me. Enough was enough. After trying to quit several times, I smoked my final cigarette after I finished doing my last final exam for the term. As I had put out the cigarette I said, "I'm done." The withdrawal did not affect me as much and days were passing without me thinking about smoking. 10 days went to 100 and then before you know it 1000. 

The struggle becomes a little bit easier every single day.

I'm proud that you've come to this subreddit considering to quit. Challenges lie ahead and it requires quite a bit of preparing to quit. I came to this subreddit as a smoker believing I could never quit. I'm glad to have proved myself wrong.

I'm also proud of those of you who have already quit. Indeed cravings come back to haunt us, but at this point we're equipped to fight back. Well done to you guys.

relapsed, now smoking is giving me headaches.

i made it 20 days, relapsed for a few days, then realized my sudden constant headaches must've been due to smoking again. 

threw my pack out again last night because the headaches were so miserable.

this never used to happen.

go figure, woke up and now i have no headache. so i guess here it goes again.

edit: this happen to anyone else?
edit 2: been well over 12 hours, no headaches have happened. what horseshit nicotine is.

Questions regarding vapourizers, weed mixed with tobacco and quitting.

So I currently live in Amsterdam and smoke weed mixed with tobacco. I smoke around 3-5 joints a day. When I'm drinking I smoke rollies (5-6 usually). I drink 3-4 nights a week. Unfortunately I started smoking occasionally during work, sometimes not at all, sometimes up to 5 rollies over 10 hours. 

It gets a bit confusing when I say I'm a bartender who sometimes drinks so lets just say I smoke around 80 rollies a week. I don't know what the equivalent is in cigarettes. 

I know for myself that I won't stop smoking weed until I leave Amsterdam, which could be another 2 years at most. I've gone months smoking barely any weed while travelling but in Amsterdam, with my friends, my wife and coffeeshops everywhere, it's just not going to happen at the moment

Whenever I smoke weed through a vapourizer I miss that throat feel and the nicotine buzz.

What I was thinking was to get 2 vapourizers, one for weed and one for e-liquid. I could take a few hits of weed and a hit of the e-liquid. I feel it's the mouth feel and finger feel that I crave the most besides the nicotine itself during work/drinking. 

Do you think this idea could work or am I being naive? Any advice or experiences would be great.

Experiencing unusual satisfactions after being smoke-free

So any unusual satisfactions you got/experienced  after being a smoke-free ? Mine was trying the smoke-free sections in any restaurant given, you heard it right :D , may sound weird to some, but never tried it before, and hell yeah, i enjoy every second of being in a smoke-free section. Another thing, people here often ask for lighters or cigarettes on the streets, so I was always a giver back then when I used to smoke, but currently, as I'm saying "No, I don't smoke / I don't have a lighter" feels really amazing. 
So yeah, let me hear your stories as well !

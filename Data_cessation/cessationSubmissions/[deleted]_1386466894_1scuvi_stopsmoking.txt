Off and running.

In 8 days I've had only 1 cigarette, and it's 6 since my last. I've just been running and I traveled a mile more than I usually run, never got breathless or choked for air, and recovered from the 40 minutes of exercise without much of a coughing fit. Usually I'd be coughing or wheezing for about 10 minutes... it only lasted 1 or 2. I feel, truly, like a different person. Like I could go out and do it again.

After 1 week I am astonished at the benefit to my health. I can't wait to see what the next months bring because I know it will be AWESOME!

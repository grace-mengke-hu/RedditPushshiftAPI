11 days in...

Still getting cravings of varying intensity. It's funny how they work. I get them whenever I have a moment with a clear 'opportunity' to smoke. You know? The work break, as you exit the airport, before you get on the car... all these little moments that I used to 'cherish' because they 'allowed' me to smoke, that's when I'm getting the cravings...

However, I'm loving how clean my mouth feels. How my clothes don't reek. How I don't have to sneak outside and leave the party for a cigarette. How I walked into a hotel room at 6pm, put on my PJ's and got room service without having to leave the room for a smoke. How I can climb to the third floor without getting winded. How all flavors and smells are becoming more intense and more complex and more nuanced... its awesome...

Won't go back. Not one puff. Not ever again. I can't. I'm liking this too much.

A huge part of my addiction is nightlife -- how can I pare back on my going out? Has anyone struggled with this?

Happy to answer any questions that might help. I smoke 3 packs a week and I absolutely hate it. I loathe it, I am sickened by it. I want out. But I go out 3 or 4 nights a week. I'm addicted to this lifestyle. I've been making major in roads in other ways, including I stopped taking adderral. But now it's smoking's turn. What can I do? Thanks in advance!

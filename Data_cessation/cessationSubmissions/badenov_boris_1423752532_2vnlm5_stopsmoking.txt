Question about nicotine in blood stream once you quit?

Hi everyone - I hope this is the right subreddit.  I've been a lurker for a while, hence the brand new account.

I've been a smoker for a long time, and been thinking about quitting.  My hand is about to be forced, because there's a very good chance I'm going to get offered a job in the next couple of weeks where they do blood tests for nicotine.  

How long does nicotine stay in your blood once you stop smoking?

Can I just smoke the coming stressful 15 days!! plz :(

I used to be a chain smoker! I have been crazy about fitness the last 5 months, I've only smoked on night outs when i was drunk in total less than 10 throughout the 5 months.

Now I am going through the last 15 days of submitting my masters dissertation! I take speed sometimes and it increases my urges to smoke! can I please just smoke for the 15 days and give it up again after please!!! a cig is all I think about i think it will help with getting work done!! I can give up I have done it before i will again!

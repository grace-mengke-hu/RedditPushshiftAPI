I broke

I broke the other day, I think my trigger was going back to work during my summer job. I have been doing great but 3 days ago I had that urge and lack of control where part of me just decided to go grab a pack of cigarettes. It's a feeling I have always had during my struggle with them. It's like a demon or my subconsious taking over for a few minutes. Historically that's what kept me a smoker and over 130 days ago I was able to take control. Well like I said I broke down and now am resetting my badge. 
Weakness won so I am going to jump back on the horse and keep riding the smoke free life I was enjoying for over 4 months... 
I'll be back here the next week almost everyday to check in and talk it through with my fellow quitters. I am not going to dwell on this too much but that little bastard demon that is addiction is something I have to keep being aware of and not to let my guard down...

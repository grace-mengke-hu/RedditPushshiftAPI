Day 2 after a Relapse

Not sure what my (outdated) flair says but I picked back up a few months ago after finding out my SO was still secretly smoking. I could try to blame him but it wouldn't make sense because I quit while he was still open about it. 

Anyway, not doing anything special, just living my life and reading this sub any time I have down time. Trying to remember the things I learned from Easy Way. If I don't smoke the worst will be gone soon!

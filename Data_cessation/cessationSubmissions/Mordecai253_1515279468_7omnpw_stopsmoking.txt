Quitting smoking and sense of agency

I've been about 4 weeks nicotine and square free. Using buproprion this time (XL 150mg*2 in the morning) and it has been very helpful. I still have gotten some surprisingly intense cravings as recently as a week ago, but the buproprion seems to have made smoking kinda gross or otherwise unappealing. It's like having an itch you can't scratch, and it's been working for me.

Hoping for the best but if it all pans out I can see myself becoming a evangelist for the drug during cessation efforts.

Anyway, I was just reflecting on some posts here and have been thinking about how quitting smoking and managing to abstain for weeks, months, years affects one's sense of agency. Being whipped by nicotine and cigarettes is very humbling, if not embarrassing, and certainly made me feel that, at least to a very certain extent, I was not in proper control of my life. Has anyone else felt a renewed sense of control and efficacy during their quit? Has the experience positively influenced aspects of your life putatively quite removed from smoking?   

I'm trying to account for all the benefits I'm racking up. It also never hurts to remind y'all that I feel a ton better than a couple weeks ago and the cravings have become increasingly less distracting.

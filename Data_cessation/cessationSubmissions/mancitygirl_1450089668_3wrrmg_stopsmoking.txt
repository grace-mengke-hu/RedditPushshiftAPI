1000 hours smoke free !

It's been hard. And continues to be. I will never be a non smoker. Always an ex smoker. Hopefully that mindset will change. Even now I face challenges every day and hAve had to adapt my life to suit my new regime. To everyone out there struggling ? Don't give up. For me ? Cold turkey was the only way to go. It  takes a lot of willpower and determination and it's SO stressful but worth it. Good luck everyone. Merry smoke free Christmas !!

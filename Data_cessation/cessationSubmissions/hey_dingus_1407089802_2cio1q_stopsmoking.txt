Haven't kept up with this sub for a while. I could have been 375 days quit by now!

Wow I cannot believe it's been 375 days since the last time I reset my badge. 375 days ago I reset my badge and fell back into my smoking addiction. If I had just kept up with it, I could have been quit for over a year now.  
  
Since then I decided to get serious about quitting while away at a week-long family reunion. I wasn't going to be smoking around all my family, and I knew that a week-long head start with lots of beach time and no job would be the perfect opportunity. Right now I'm on 6 days 12hrs with no cigarette, and if I can make it through work tonight it'll be a full 7 days!  
  
Here's to a real 375 days!

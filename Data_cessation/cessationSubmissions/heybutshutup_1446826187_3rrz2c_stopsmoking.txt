Every time I've tried to quit before, I've had the same thought ...

I can't wait to be done quitting smoking so I can have a cigarette! It's such a dumb, backwards thought but it happens every time.

Also, this time around I'm feeling really confident. I think I've got this. It's still early but this time feels different.

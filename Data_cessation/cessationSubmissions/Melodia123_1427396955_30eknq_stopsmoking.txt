Day 13, this time i will make it

Hey there, i ve been smoking for about 15 years. I quit a few years ago for 10 months but one night out i thought this is long enough to be able to smoke once in a while when i drink. This was a stupid mistake and i started to drink very often just to have an excuse to smoke. So i started smoking again. After 2 years i tried to quit again but i started back after 3 months when my relationship started to get close to the end. 1,5 year later now i decided to quit again. actually its been 1.5 months now that im trying to quit but i had some on some days so i started over and over everytime i had one cigarette. For 13 days im clean and i dont want to go through the first few days cravings again. So this time will be the last time hopefully.

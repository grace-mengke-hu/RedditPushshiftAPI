72+ hours, and I'm starting to really feel crappy for the first time. Listening to "Superhero" by Bane makes me feel a little better. lol.

So the first 48 hours weren't so bad. I got a little irritable at work on Friday, but nothing I couldn't handle. Now as we move into the 4th day, I'm really starting to get on edge.

The worst part is I live in a group home/sober living environment with 15 other people, and they're all hella loud and obnoxious and disrespectful, especially on the weekends. Basically I hate people right now, and even though I (luckily!) have the room to myself because both my roommates are visiting family, I can still hear my other housemates talking (shouting!) in the living room. It's driving me mad lol. I'm listening to Superhero by Bane (a great song about quitting smoking, for anyone who hasn't heard it: https://youtu.be/Gtg03692GGE) and playing Hotline Miami 2 so I can murder some pixels instead of housemates :)

Despite feeling kind of crappy, I'm still glad I'm making this decision. Basically, I had this revelation the other day: if I can quit meth and heroin (I'm almost at 6 months clean), then I know I can do this too. One of the big problems is that so many people at the 12 step meetings I go to smoke, but I'm determined not to let that affect me too much.

Anyway, sorry for the wall o' text, just wanted to rant and ramble a bit to get out of my own head. Hello r/stopsmoking, my name is Jon, and I'm glad to be here :)

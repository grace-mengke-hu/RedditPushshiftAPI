I really want to quit

I've been seriously thinking about quitting for months now. I'm down to about 5-6 smokes a day but this last push is really giving me trouble. Everyday I say to myself 'I don't want to smoke' or 'This is my last one' but I always cave...I'm so frustrated and disappointed in myself.    
    Even as I'm smoking I'm thinking: *yuck, this is horrible.* But the cravings are just so strong. Smoking is ingrained into my day-to-day routine it's difficult to avoid the triggers since they are as simple as walking my dog or driving my car. I think my biggest problems are that first cigarette of the day and more so, smoking while I'm drinking.  
    Any advice is very welcome. I'm so ready to quit.

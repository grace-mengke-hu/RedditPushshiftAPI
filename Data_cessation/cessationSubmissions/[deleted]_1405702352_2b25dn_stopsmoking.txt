Been a week. Why did I wait this long?

I feel great. It wasn't easy. It still isn't, it **is** getting easier though. I feel better mentally and physically than I have in a long time. If you were like me, I was subscribed to this sub for probably 4 or 5 months before I actually went all in. This is my third time starting a quit. Just start quitting. You're not going to bowl a 300 your first time at the lane. Get out there. It will stick. GO FOR IT.

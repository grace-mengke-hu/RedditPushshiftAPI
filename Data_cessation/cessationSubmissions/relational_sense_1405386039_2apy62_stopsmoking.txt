Passed my one year mark

Feels nice to have reached this milestone. I haven't looked back in quite some time, but it was not always that way.

I remember the first day I quit smoking I had a long day of work (12 hours). I was really excited to head home and relax, making it through my first full day of not smoking. I'm driving on the highway and ..."pop!"... flat tire. I pulled over and up into a gas station. Southern summer heat bearing down on me. Sweating profusely. I started laughing.

In Allen Carr's book he talks a lot about cigarettes as an illusory clutch. You think the cigarette make you happier (for at least a second), but really it is slowly deepening your addiction and crippling you. The tiny -- and eventually non-existent -- moment of peace or calm the cigarette gives you is an illusion. I, like many others, tricked myself into thinking it somehow made bad situations less bad.

In that moment, there was nothing more in the world that I wanted than a cigarette. Sure, I quit with some conviction the night before, but it had only been about half a day after all. I had excused myself for one cigarette (or one pack) probably dozens of times before this for less annoying situations. Hell, all I had to do was walk into the gas station.

I took a deep breath in shaking my head, sighed, and started laughing out loud. I laughed because in that moment I simultaneously realized how easy it would be for me to give in to temptation and how much happier I would be if I restrained myself. I laughed because I realized I had reached a milestone: I was not going to go into the gas station and I was *finally* going to quit smoking. 

I said to myself, "a cigarette ain't gonna fix this tire any quicker". The sun was hot, but I didn't care. My hands were grimed, but I didn't care. My car was a hassle, but I didn't care. I changed the tire with a smile on my face and never looked back.

It was a good day.

12 days without smoking after 20 years of a consistent habit.

I never thought I would make it this far. The cravings are lessening and when it gets to be too much I eat some gum.
Otherwise, I'm holding steady.

Gum, water, the Allen Carr book and the Smoke Free app have helped a lot!

On to day 13!!!

4 days not smoking - incredibly anxious

Hi all,

I've been smoking for 6 years both cigarettes and weed. I caught a bad case of pneumonia at the start of December which caused me to decide to pack it all in. So I've quit the drugs both legal and illegal! I'm obviously feeling proud of myself but I'm also getting hit by some strong panic attacks.

I've always been an anxious person and used cigs to counter it but now I've noticed I've become very health anxious. Some days it feels like I can always feel my heartbeat, my lungs can feel tight and I get lightheaded/pressure headaches - which can be both anxiety but also a whole host of other health issues, which just sets me further down the spiral.

So, has anyone else experienced strong anxiety? I'm guessing quitting both weed and cigs is causing the strong anxiety feeling but I just don't want to feel alone. Thanks.

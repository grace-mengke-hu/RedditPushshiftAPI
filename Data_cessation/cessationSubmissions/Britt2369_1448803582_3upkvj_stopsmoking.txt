So tired of failing!!

Edit: just wanted to say a huge thank you to everyone for your words of encouragement, advice, and suggestions! Really means a lot..
I can see this sub and the people in it are very supportive. I plan to stick around and keep you all updated, and hopefully be able to help someone else down the road when I have been quit for awhile!! Thanks again! 


I posted in this sub about a year ago, so dead set on quitting, and I lasted less then a week. That was about my 6th or 7th attempt at quitting. 

I am here again, mainly because I feel so terrible, my chest is constantly burning, I wake up coughing and hacking, you all know the drill. This time, like the rest I feel motivated. But scared. I'm scared of failing again! I've tried the patch, I've tried the gum, I've tried all the nicotine replacement things, I've tried Allan carrs easy way to quit smoking, I've tried cold turkey. It just feels like I've tried everything and have still failed, so how is this time going to be any different? 

I have planned in advance this time, I didn't just decide to quit on a whim like all the other times, I picked my quit date over a month ago, and here I am, one day away from my quit date and I am terrified and full of anxiety. I feel like I've already failed before starting because of how doubtful I am that I will actually succeed this time. I'm trying to change my thought process and believe in myself a little more, but with the amount of times I've failed before it's proving to be very hard!! 

I'm sorry for the wall of text, and to be honest I'm not sure why I even posted here, maybe because I haven't told anyone in my life my plans because they have heard it so many times they probably wouldn't even believe me anyway, and I just want to tell someone. Also, maybe for some advice, anything that could be offered to help would be much appreciated.

Day 1 : Success

First time poster, long time lurker.

It's not much, but 24 hours is the longest I've gone without smoking in over 8 years.. mostly a pack or more per day.  Currently Im using an e-cigarette (24mg watermelon flavor in a $40 e-cig kit) and the Cessation Nation app to stay away from smoking.  After several failed attempts using the e-cig to quit within the last few years, something just clicked and I didn't want anything to do with smoking cigarettes.  At work, my coworker was smoking near me and I wasnt phased as much as I thought I'd be.  Honestly, all I could think about is how excited I'd be when it hit that 24 hour mark since I'd smoked. .. and how proud my girlfriend would be of me. Whatever it is, I'm excited for my future.  Best of luck to everyone in their journey.

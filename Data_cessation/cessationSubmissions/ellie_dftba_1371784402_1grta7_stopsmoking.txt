Day 1: A Gift for My Little Brother

Hi all! 
I am very excited to have found this subreddit. I have been toying with the idea if quitting for a while, but I never wanted to commit. My little brother found out that I smoke(d) about 6 months ago, and he cried. It broke my heart, but I just wasn't ready. Well, my little brother turns 10 next week, and for his birthday, I am quitting. So here we go. 
I just want it to be public- for there to be a record of my commitment.

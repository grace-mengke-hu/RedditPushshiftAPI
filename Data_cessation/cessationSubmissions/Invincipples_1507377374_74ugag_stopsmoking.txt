Finished my last cigarette 20 minutes ago.

Hi everyone! Excited to be here.

I've quit in the past for up to 3 months at a time, but my best friend smokes. It has become part of our routine when we haven't seen each other to sit out behind her place and smoke while we catch up. I don't want to not be able to see her, but I know that I've started smoking again in the past because I think: "Oh, it's only a couple when I see [my friend]." What are your tips for staying social while also staying smoke-free? People have tried to get her to quit in the past, and I've always been the person never to question her decision to continue smoking. Just looking for any advice anyone has to offer. Thank you!

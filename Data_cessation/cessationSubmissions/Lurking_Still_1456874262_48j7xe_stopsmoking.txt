Time to go.

I've been hanging around to see the 1,000 day icon, but honestly I don't need the sub anymore.

That, and every third post here is some ungodly circlejerk about Allen Carr. Seriously, fuck this guy. His book didn't tell you shit. You just finally stopped being a little coward about your problem and stopped making excuses for yourself. Just like I did.

To give credit for that personal growth to some assbag is demeaning, you did the hard work, as did I. We deserve the credit, not some moneygrubbing parasite making money off of the weak and gullible. 

Allen Carr is essentially a televangelist. 

Buh-bye /r/stopsmoking

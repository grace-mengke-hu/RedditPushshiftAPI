Slow progress for me (First Post)

I have been smoking since I was 16 and I am now 27. I had a wake up call that I needed to quit smoking (money, health, smell, etc). I was smoking almost a pack a day but I am taking a slow process instead of quitting all at once (for my safety and the safety of others who work next to me). I started by quitting when I drove and when I was at work. Now I'm working out more and I'll start training for my first half marathon Saturday. I am now down to one or two cigs a day only when I'm at home. My only other downfall is smoking at the bar when I have been drinking. Anyone else have advice for me who have gone this route?

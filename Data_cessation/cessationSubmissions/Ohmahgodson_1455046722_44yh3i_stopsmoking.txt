182 days. 3,654 cigs not smoked. $1151 saved

Not so subtle brag post. It feels GREAT to be nicotine free for more than 6 months, especially recently celebrating my child's first birthday. 

To all of you on week 1, day 1, hour 1... I remember it vividly. You will get through it. I promise. Be nice to yourself and dont feel like you are being deprived... you're not.

What has worked for me so far is Alan Carr's easy way and continually reminding myself that I didnt give up anything by quitting. I only gained back my health, self respect, and some weight (oh well! lol). 

After only a few weeks, with fewer and fewer cravings, I realized that the WORST cravings I had was when I was smoking. Think about it; many people dont quit because they fear cravings. Well the only way to guarantee you'll experience cravings every ~1hr is if you keep smoking! As a non smoker I can make it through a long flight or meeting without a craving now. As a smoker? I would have been (and was) miserable!

I know I always need to remain vigilant. No cigars, no "just one", no "for old times", no "just to remember how nasty they are", no hookah, no vape, no chew... no nicotine. Never again!

I want to again thank this community. It was a huge help in the early days, especially with the courage I received. You can do this! Everyone!

ETA: It seems my app doesnt give me credit for the night I quit ;P

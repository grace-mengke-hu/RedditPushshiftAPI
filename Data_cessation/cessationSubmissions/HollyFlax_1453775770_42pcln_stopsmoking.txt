32 days without a cig! I can't believe I'm actually doing it :)

I had my last cigarette on Christmas eve after smoking around a pack a day for about 9 years. I graduated with my BA in early December and had been planning to quit after the stress of school/finals was over. I had tried to quit a couple times prior but never made it past a week. 

I got super lucky this time around: on my quit date I came down with a terrible chest cold. I think the mental preparedness plus being sick made the first week so much easier for me. I love getting on here and seeing people with so many days between them and their last smoke - I hope to stay quit! Dreaming of the 3 month mark now. Just wanted to post a few things that have helped me this time around in case it helps anybody trying to quit :)

* Jolly Ranchers and Nicorette have really helped with cravings. I've never used nicotine gum before and found I really like it compared to other smoking cessation aides. It mimics the ritual of smoking in a way. I'm off the gum now, but I highly recommend trying it or even keeping it on hand as a last resort.

* Don't drink! Alcohol has ruined all my previous attempts to quit. I don't plan on drinking again until it's been at least 3 months. It's not as fun hanging out with friends sober, but I'm saving so much money and time - I really do feel better overall. I quit taking Adderall at the same time as well. There's no way in hell I'd be able to quit while still using alcohol and my ADHD meds. My brain feels totally different giving up these habits, in (mostly) positive ways.

* Switching to iced coffee. There's something about hot coffee that makes most people crave a smoke. I've been having at least 4 glasses of iced coffee a day, and it seems to really help with the cravings. 

* Working out. It's a great way to increase dopamine and measure your body's improvement after quitting. 

* Be super nice to yourself. Quitting is hard and something to be proud of. You might need extra sleep or to forget about housework, etc. for the first few weeks. That's ok, that's great even. Lower your stress levels as much as possible - just about anything you need to do or not do is worth it if it means you never pick up a cigarette again. 

* I have a quit smoking app on my phone that tells me how much money I've saved ($147!), cigs not smoked (574) and time saved (2.5 days). I can't believe I was spending that much TIME smoking. At least two days a month I spent just sitting around or standing around outside with a cigarette. Crazy!

* My husband is quitting with me. I'm three days ahead of him and intend to stay that way. 

Sorry for the wall of text! I hope it benefits somebody. I'm so, so happy that I'm finally taking this step. Surprisingly, my anxiety is way less than it was when I was smoking. It took about 2-3 weeks for that to happen. Good luck to everyone trying to quit!

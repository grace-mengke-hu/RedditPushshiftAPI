Anybody quit due to physical pain from smoking?

I've had enough and am done smoking. 10 years, pack a day, and about 3 months ago my cough started getting worse, I would experience weird internal pains all throughout my body and always have a headache. Just curious if anyone else experienced the negative physical affects from smoking, and if they felt healthier after quitting. Pretty disheartening when the only positive thing people talk about in regards to quitting are "ohh I save money" "ooohhh derrr I don't smell like an ashtray anymore" ok well........."are you at least breathing better?" Help me out.

Am I just fooling myself by postponing the quit date?

I've had a meltdown today after relapsing for the 4th time in a week. I've thrown away at least 3 half full packs in the last couple of days. I keep coming back to smoking but every time I relapse I have a good crying session.

I will be moving to another country in order to study in a little less than two weeks. I will be away from my family and friends. I feel very emotional all the time. I can't resist the urge to smoke. I've also been on a strict diet for some time now and it requires me to stay hungry for hours which turns me into a monster.

After relapsing today, I've made up my mind about quitting after I move out. Cigarettes are much more expensive there and I feel like that could be a supporting factor. And I think getting to know the area and new people could also keep me busy.

What do you guys think? Does my plan sound realistic or am I just kidding myself?

Edit: Also trying to reduce the amount of alcohol I consume, which also turns me into a monster.

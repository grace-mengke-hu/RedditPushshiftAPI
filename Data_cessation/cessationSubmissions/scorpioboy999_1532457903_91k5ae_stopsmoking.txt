Havent smoked in over a week. Itching for an alternative

I'm in my early 20s. I started smoking when I was 13/14ish. I've quit smoking cigarettes multiple times in my life. The longest was 2.5 years then I picked the habit up again this summer. Currently havent smoked in 7-8  days or so. I wish there was just an alternative to replace smoking. I just enjoyed being in my car on a nice summer day listening to music and lighting up a cigarette. Not much can replace that for me. I'm not into drugs. I don't like alcohol. I kicked weed a year ago too. Sometimes you just got to have a little vice. and cigarettes were mine. I probably won't pick up the habit again any time soon. but yeah

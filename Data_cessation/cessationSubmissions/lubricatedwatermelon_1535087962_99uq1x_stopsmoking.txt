Day 9. I think I've traded a smoking habit for an eating habit

It's funny because I've always harshly judged overweight people. Why the fuck can't they stop eating? I would deserve it of I became fat. I feel bad that I ever thought this way.

I nearly cried over this thought. It was a weird emotional thing that just went down. Nicotine is weird...?

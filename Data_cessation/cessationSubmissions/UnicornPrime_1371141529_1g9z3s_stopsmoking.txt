Quit 3 weeks ago and got my mom and two brothers to quit in one week!

I've smoked for 12 years, since I was 17.  I tried a vapor pen and was surprised at how satisfying it was.  After about a day of using it, the desire for a real cigarette was hardly there.  I raved about it to my mom, who has smoked for more than 40 years.  She tried it, and liked it so much she bought one for each of my brothers.  My brother who is a long-haul trucker and smokes 2 packs/day had 2 cigs this week, otherwise he's been using the vapor pen.  

The weird thing is this- I quit using my pen completely after a couple of weeks.  My mom just after this weekend has hardly used hers either.  We each tried a real cigarette and it disgusted us!  This leads me to believe that it wasn't the nicotine in cigarettes that we needed.  It was all the other tar and poisons that had us hooked and it feels freaking AWESOME to be be free of them!

I think the thing that turns people off to the idea of vapor cigs is the cost.  I live in Southern California and the local smoke shops charge $40-60 to get set up with a decent pen and liquid chamber.  I was able to find pens with chargers online for $8-10.  If you'd like info on where I'd find them to try it yourself pm me.

Also, I don't work for anyone, I just want to share an awesome alternative to smelly, expensive cigs and my story of how I was able to give up nicotine completely :)

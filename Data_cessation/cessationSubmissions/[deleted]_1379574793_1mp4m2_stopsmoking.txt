Today's the day!

So, I'm quitting for health reasons. I've been plagued by GERD since I became a smoker, and at 22 years old, being in constant pain isn't a nice thing. Doctors have tried all sorts of meds to control it, but I'm fairly convinced that it's down to smoking, as it never happened before I started.

I've got work today, and it's miserable outside. But if I can deal with it on a day like today, I can deal with it any day.

Here's to good health!

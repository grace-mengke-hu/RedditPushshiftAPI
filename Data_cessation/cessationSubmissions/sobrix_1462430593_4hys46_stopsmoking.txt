69 days going strong.

I quit around 70 days ago. It has improved me mentally and physically. I go the gym 4-5 days per week and had trouble bulking up, but after I quit it was relatively easy for me to bulk up. Went from 169 to 183 (I'm 6"1). The only thing that doesn't go away is the want to go outside for a smoke every 6 hours. I forget about it at times, but it simply will not go away. I think it's more mental at this point than physical.

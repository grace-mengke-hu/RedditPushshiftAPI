Never take another puff.

DO NOT underestimate this line after quitting. It might seem simple and might sound like something that your mom would nag at you about when you were a kid. That one puff has the power to make all of your efforts on quitting go to waste. Take note that after you became a smoker, you can never go back to being a social smoker. 

I had a puff of a cigarette a a few days back without inhaling it into my lungs(I kinda of just kept it in my mouth and let it out) and I started feeling like it was getting harder to breathe and I started to crave for cigarettes for the next half a day, even though the puff I took tasted disgusting.

TL;DR NEVER TAKE ANOTHER PUFF, DON'T UNDERESTIMATE IT

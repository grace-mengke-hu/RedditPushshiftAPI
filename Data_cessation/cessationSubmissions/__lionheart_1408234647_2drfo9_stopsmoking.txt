I slipped.

And I feel like shit for it. My boyfriend and I got into an argument, and he told me that his brother and all of his close friends have been telling him that he should break up with me. I got all emotional and was crying so much I ran to what I used to go to all the time, for comfort. Cigarettes. I had two. 

I feel very disappointed in myself.

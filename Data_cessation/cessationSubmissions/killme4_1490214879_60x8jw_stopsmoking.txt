things I don't miss

the stench of my room being noticably present whenever you walk in.
the money i would have spent on tobacco (because i have it ;p).
hiding my habit from family and friends.
running away from my responsibilities instead of facing them.
not being able to fully appreciate flavours in food.
not being able to jog or do exercise without panting my heart out.
missing potentially sweet or exciting moments with friends because I had to go outside due to my urges.

these are a few things i dont miss, feel free to add yours ;)

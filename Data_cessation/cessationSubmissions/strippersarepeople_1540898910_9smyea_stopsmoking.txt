I’m smoking my last cigarette right now.

I’ve tried to quit so many times, especially recently and I’m just tired of it. I’m done.  
Yesterday I started vacuuming my house, which has turned into getting rid of furniture and rearranging everything, and something about making a fresh start in that way has me feeling motivated to make a fresh start quitting too.   
I’ll probably be on here a lot and will also probably smoke a lot of weed (and get a CBD pen) like I did the first time I quit (for five years!!!!) but I think that’s a lot better than cigarettes. Wish me luck comrades.

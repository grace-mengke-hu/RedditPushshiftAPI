14 days and clawing at 15

I’m a long time lurker posting for the first time.  I quit cold turkey 14 days ago.  Breaking out in sweets, no concentration, anxiety, and—worse—total change of habit/lifestyle.  I’m hurting and I feel like I’m coming unglued.  My wife is proud and supportive of me.  And I had gotten to a point where my doctor insisted I stop.  And I wanted to as well, and still do.  Does this get better... I know that it must pass, but I just need to hear it from someone else right now!

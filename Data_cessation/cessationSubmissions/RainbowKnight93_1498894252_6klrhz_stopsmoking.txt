Trying again

I quit smoking for 6 months then my birthday came around I bought a pack and made it last 2 weeks (I was a very heavy smoker) after that I thought I would continue to do good, but then it  got back up to a pack a day now I'm trying again. Last time I quit pretty much cold turkey this time I'm trying Wellbutrin I don't think the medicine has fully kicked in yet, but here is day number 1 smoke free. I don't remember it being this hard. Ive been smoking for almost 10 years. Any tips?

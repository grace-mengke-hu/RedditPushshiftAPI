First steps are always the hardest... quitting this weekend!

Hey guys so im a strong smoker, i always have a cigarette in my mouth if i can help it, chain smoke etc

I started smoking about the age of 18, im 26 now... started smoking joints with tobacco in them and got hooked to nicotine that way. Quit smoking weed about a year ago but still very very occasionally have a couple of puffs on a joint if i go back and visit my old friends in england (i live in paris now)

Im on my last couple of grams of tobacco left and decided im not going to buy anymore, the packet should get me through work until friday (i dont want to quit cold turkey on a work day) then thats it for me... im planning on making myself a synthetic cigarette made from a rizla paper with rolling filters inside it so i still have something in my hands and something i can take a toke from if i really have cravings but I hope I can do this... wish me luck will post updates

Other ideas i have is if i crave a cigarette is going for a short walk around the block at work/home 

if anyone has any other tips make sure to let me know!

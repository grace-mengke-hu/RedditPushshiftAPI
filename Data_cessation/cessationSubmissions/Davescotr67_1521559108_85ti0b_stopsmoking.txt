Two years and 4 days later, i now have 4 days smoke free

I've been trying to quit for two years now. I never seem to get very far. This time I had to quit trying and just do it. I went to death valley to go camping v with a group of non smokers. I always feel ashamed smoking around my non-smoking friends so I abstained. I've gotten through the hardest part. Fear of
  withdrawals was keeping me from quitting. But now fear of restarting is keeping me healthy.

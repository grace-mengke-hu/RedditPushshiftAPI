Why staying quit is harder for me than quitting

Ill try to make this as short as i can.

Early last year i was put on anti-depressants. Doctor said i had very severe depression and wanted to treat it with pills. I quit those after a month. That was easy for me.

It was easy because smoking has always controlled my depression. I've been able to keep it manageable because the chemicals make you feel good (as you're all aware.)

This is at least the 5th time I've quit in the last 2 or 3 years. Its the same thing every time.

Except for this time. I feel like this time i can do it, because smoking again just isn't an option anymore.

I just needed to vent a bit. I'm okay, don't worry.

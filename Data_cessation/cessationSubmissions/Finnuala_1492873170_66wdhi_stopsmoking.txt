Partners still smoking

I'm trying to quit a 20 a day habit and am doing ok but my partner still smokes and I'm finding it really hard not to steal his cigarettes!! When I'm not around him I'm fine but as soon as I am the urge to smoke again is huge - I'm hoping that's just s habit to break as we've always smoked together... I'm on day 4 and have relapsed twice but back on track again now I hope

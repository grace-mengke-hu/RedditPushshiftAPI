The progress update of quitting cold turkey - 40 days without nicotine, caffeine, refined sugar, and alcohol

Hey all!

I'd like to just vent a little here and give my experience on quitting nicotine + others (all cold turkey!)

I did plan on quitting caffeine, added/refined sugar, and alcohol eventually because I had found that I would always rely on them for my "fix" to feel better. 

I have managed to get through 40 days so far without having one bit of nicotine! No cigarettes, alcohol, caffeine, or added/refined sugar. I did use weed to combat the first 2 weeks of pure absolute hell which was a mixture of the smoker's flu, horrendous mood swings, and extreme depression & anxiety. It worked by kicking the withdrawals both physically and mentally - I have since stopped using weed as a way to cope.

I have been using the gym as a tool for my frustration and a way to better myself both mentally and physically. I guess if I'm working out and clearing my head, that's a bonus! 

If you are reading this and are contemplating quitting cigarettes or any other substances (even the socially acceptable ones) because you feel miserable everyday - do it! It's the first step to feeling truly at peace with yourself. I have been heavily addicted to drugs (both "hard" and "soft" drugs if you will) for as long as I can remember, but I think that even for some of us lost souls who are coming back into the world, there will always be hope!

I'd like to just finish off by saying that although I do not visit this sub not that much anymore, I would like to point out that this has to be the BEST sub for people like us who struggle with addictions.

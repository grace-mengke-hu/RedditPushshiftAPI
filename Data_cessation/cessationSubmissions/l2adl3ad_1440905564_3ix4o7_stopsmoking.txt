I've quit smoking cigarettes!

I'm 19 years old and as the title says, I've decided to stop smoking cigarettes.

I've been smoking for 3 years, more or less and have never tried to quit. Smoking has never been an addiction to me, it's something that I did and if I couldn't do it (because of a lack of money) than I would still be fine. Don't get me wrong, I consider myself to be addicted to cigarettes these past years, but I also used to be a heroin addict and when I couldn't use heroin, *it was not okay.* But when I wasn't able to smoke, it was okay. My smoking would fluctuate, I would smoke a pack a day some months, and others I would smoke a cigarette every week.

Anyways, I haven't smoked in a couple weeks despite being able to. I actually bought a couple of packs to bring to college and I haven't even opened them (I go to school in NY where you need to be 21 to buy cigarettes). I don't even think about them actually and today was the first time I thought about it and I've decided that I'm going to try and quit forever. I always told myself that I envisioned myself quitting one day but never did I actually know when that day would be. Well that's bad thinking, today is that day!

Unfortunately, I have lots of other nasty habits to quit, but this is a great step towards a healthier lifestyle and I'm glad I feel this way about that matter. I hope I can quit for good and don't start smoking again, wish me luck!

To all who are thinking about quitting, have already quit or what have you, I sincerely wish you the best. **Stopping can only help you and can never hurt you.**

wrapping up Day 4 smoke-free.

Day 4 was a big day for me. I kind of went through the previous 3 days dragging my feet, fighting the cravings, questioning whether I really wanted to do this, and having constant headaches. 

Today I woke up feeling great. Got a compliment from a co-worker as soon as I got to work, she said I look a lot more lively today. I felt great. And the best part, not a single craving all day. I hope this continues.

Oh yeah, forgot to mention. So yesterday was the complete opposite, Day 3 was the hardest by far. I lost count of the headaches, and it seemed like every little thing was trying to get me to smoke. At the end of the day, I went into a drawer in my bedroom that I rarely open and there was a pack of smokes. When I had quit in the past, I would make a big deal out of it and have some kind of ceremonial last cigarette before throwing the rest of the pack away. This time when I quit, I took a different route, I didn't put the addiction on some kind of pedastal and make a big deal of it. I just said "I'm done", and I put the pack in that drawer as I wasn't sure if this was going to be for real or not (this is my 3rd attempt in the last year or so). Well I'm happy to say that after a long day of fighting the urges, I didn't give in when I saw that pack. I thought about it for like 2 seconds and then threw the pack away. This was a big confidence booster for me. I think this 3rd attempt is for real.

Not vaping is so hard :(

I've been vaping for 5 years (oops), smoking regularly three years before that, but even longer intermittently when I was underage. 

I've been down to a low dose of nicotine for a while, but a lot of it is just the hand-to-mouth. It's been 34 hours. I don't even know if I'm really craving the nicotine, or just used to the habit. Finish eating, take a puff. About to walk the dog, take a puff. etc etc etc. I start to look for my cigarette before realizing that I'm doing this.,, To myself. On purpose. 

Remembering that I AM doing this on purpose and for/to myself helps me rationalize it. But It's hard to remember when I've been in the habit for so long. I love reading the success stories here and can't wait to tack on another 6 easy hours to my total since I'm about to go to bed. ((BUT sleeping was hared last and I woke up before my alarm. Secretly hoping a non-nicotine me doesn't need as much sleep)

One week in, this time 7 days ago I finished my last cigarette.

I have to say it's starting to get easier, I still want a cigarette, and my body is still used to the habit of doing it, but I'm handling it a lot better now.  
  
I think this is the longest I've gone without a cigarette in at least 20 years... I have to admit I'm pretty proud of myself right now.

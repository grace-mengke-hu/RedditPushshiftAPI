Chest problems... I have a smokers' cough but haven't smoked for 2 months.

It is embarrassing for me to be coughing up phlegm every day, and have it stick in my throat when around women I like. I tell myself that my body is cleaning itself out (I still drink) but how long can this go on? It has been two weeks now. As for excercise, I recently did 2,000 km on my touring bike. 

Tell me Non-smoking Redditors, is this normal?

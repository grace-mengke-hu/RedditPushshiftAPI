Couple questions for those who have succeeded. (I really want to quit this horrible habit)

I smoke around 10-12 cigs a day. Sometimes less..but every now and then I'll go through a pack in a day. My morning cigarette is very important to me. But not one cig goes by where I am not thinking about how disgusting it is, how badly I need to quit, and how worried I am that I may never quit. I hate this addiction!

What made realize you have to quit?
When did you realize you should quit and how long did you continue to smoke?
How did you deal with the withdrawals?
What in your life has changed since quitting?

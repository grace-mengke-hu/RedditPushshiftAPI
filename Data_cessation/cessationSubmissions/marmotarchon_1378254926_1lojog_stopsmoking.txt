can't believe I'm coming up on 100 days already ...

It seems like just last week that I got my badge and made my first post on this subreddit. And, amazingly, I haven't taken a puff yet.

I'm feeling much, much better. I started going to the gym, started spending money that I would otherwise be spending on cigarettes on protein and creatine (don't judge!) and I've put on 20 lbs and am much more toned. I am much more clear-minded. My friends who smoke seem chained to this terrible habit that leaves them craving something they can never fully attain, many of them want to stop but can't. I try to encourage them to stop without being annoying about it. 

Self-mastery is a rocky process. It's a struggle of habit, every day; small improvements are huge. I feel like quitting smoking was no small improvement.

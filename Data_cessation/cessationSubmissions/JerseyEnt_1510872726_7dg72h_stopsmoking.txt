Got 5 wisdom teeth taken out yesterday morning.

I usually smoke about 7 cigarettes a day but since I've gotten them removed I haven't craved one yet. With the fear of getting dry socket and with pain on top of that, there's really no desire.. 

Anybody quit smoking after they've had their wisdom teeth out?

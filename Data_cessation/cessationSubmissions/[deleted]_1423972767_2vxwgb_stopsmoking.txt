I'm a monster! Quitting smoking, please help!

Day one: I am going to kill my boyfriend and my little brother. Boyfriend is so sick and tired of me trying to quit because I usually only manage to stay smoke free for a couple of days and during that time it is extremely dangerous to be around me as I become a force to be reckon with. At this point he just tells me to smoke and gets really angry that I'm not getting out of bed as to avoid triggers so the house goes unclean and he has to take the dog out. I do want to quit and I am sorry I haven't been able to yet. I feel for the guy, I do. I would have already knocked me out by now. Ha. Little brother quit five months ago and it was easier for him so he has just been calling me a whiner. Also, I love my brother but he is so annoying sometimes. He talks and talks and asks questions like a little kid over and over. Normally this is not an issue for me. I love him soo much and I am used to it, but right now I wanted to staple his mouth shut and lock him in his room. (he lives with the boyfriend and I) So, no support and to top it off they make me feel bad for not adjusting perfectly and for hiding in my bedroom. Now, about me. I am insane! I was trying to take the tinfoil off of my dogs left over treats and it ripped, and I was filled with RAGE! Seriously, it's scary how angry I become and that I can't control myself. I am using nicotine gum, but that isn't helping with the mood fluctuations. How did you and your SO cope with quitting smoking and the craziness that comes with it. Also, what are some tips that helped you stay smoke free and not kill everyone. :) hahaha! Ah.

Now remembering how difficult this first week is... 

Fourth time quitting, on & off smoker for 15+ years.  You'd think the torment endured in previous quitting attempts would've been enough to keep me away from the weed.......

Read Allen Carr's EASYWAY, practicing deep breathing, attempting yoga and going jogging daily.  So far so good!

EDIT: And I know, I'm not quitting anything.  I'm gaining freedom!

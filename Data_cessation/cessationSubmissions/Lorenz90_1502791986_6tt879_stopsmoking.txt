I tried so many times that failing became the normal.

I try to stop smoking every 2 or 3 months, every time i fail after 1 or 2 days, when i don't smoke i get depressed and i start thinking that prefer i to die young instead of spend the whole life without smoking.

Of course that's all bullshit but the me without nicotine it's just an idiot like that, how can i break this cycle of trying/failing every time?

Best recommendations for a vape pen to help quit smoking?

Been smoking since about 2007, nearly a pack every two days, sometimes more.  I'm now 33 years old and my lung capacity is terrible, especially when exercising.  If anybody has any great recommendations for a vape pen to help ween off of nicotine, that would be much obliged.  Thanks a lot guys and great job to everyone on this subreddit who have made the change, or making a conscious effort to quit cigs.  It's fuckin hard...really really hard.

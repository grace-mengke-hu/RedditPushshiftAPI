Cold Turkey

I'm 31 and I guess I've been a tobacco smoker for as much as 8 years tricking myself (smoke relentlessly with weed) but a pure tobacco smoker (rollies) for 3/4 years. Either way, I neither enjoyed it nor wish to continue.

I have chosen a rather dreadful time though, quite recently myself and my girlfriend broke up and thus the feelings are rather all over the place right now. Part of me thinks that depression is real and relative to the lady, the other part thinks it's the peaks and troughs due to nicotine.

While my feelings are really out of control I must say that I found the craving element easy enough to ignore. There were a couple instances of "you need this want this bad" and I passed it easily in my mind.

So it is the secondary subconcious withdrawal factors that are getting me. My sleep is a little restless but I have been active in the gym recently so I find that helps to tire myself out.

What I have noticed and this is immediate is the burning sensation in my legs (not gym related), I've read this is circulation related and though it may hurt, if I can feel physical benefits already then I'm excited by that.

Giving it my all and really hopeful :)

FAIL

Quit smoking 2 months ago. I was doing so good and then 2 weeks ago I had one that turned into one more turned into a pack a day. 

So I'm back in again. Need to change my flair. At work light-headed, dizzy, cranky, starving, can't pay attention for shit. I'm just really disappointed in myself. Fuck.

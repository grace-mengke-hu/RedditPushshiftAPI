Encouraging others

As I enter day 4, I think one thing that helps us helping or encouraging others in their journeys. You end up reinforcing all your thoughts on why you wanted to quit in the first place when you talk to others in the same place. So I challenge you all to comment at least once on someone's post with positive vibes and support - see if it helps you in the process. Cheers!

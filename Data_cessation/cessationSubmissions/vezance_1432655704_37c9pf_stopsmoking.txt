Anyone who quit but smokes hukkah?

I have a few friends who I always smoke hukkah with every weekend (we usually play cards or just talk while smoking it). I am just into my third day in my second attempt at quitting. The last time, I did not smoke hukkah. But to do that I stopped meeting them for a few weeks, till I finally relapsed anyway. It is easy to avoid a five-minute craving. Much more difficult to ignore the pipe in your face for 2-3 hours straight. 

I wanted to know if anyone has quit smoking but used to have hukkah even while quitting. Does it have any impact on the process? Does it bring the cravings back stronger? Or can I steal a few puffs?

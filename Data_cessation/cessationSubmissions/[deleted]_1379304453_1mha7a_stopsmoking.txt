Thoughts on hookah?

Hi everyone! I've only been a smoker for about 2 years, but I grew up around it. The smell is like home to me, in a way.

I've tried quitting before. I know everyone loves EasyWay but it just didn't really work for me. I like the thought of "being free" instead of "giving up" though. It really helps, but it couldn't quite seal the deal for me.

Anyways, I want to quit. I need to quit. I'm quitting. I haven't had a cigarette since last Wednesday :) But, I'm a big "habit-based" smoker (sorry if I'm perpetuating myths or something about something that don't exist - I welcome any and all corrections), so I figured I'd do something that "isn't harmful" (wrong, I know, but I want more explanations on why). I picked up a hookah stick while at the mall, thinking that it would be safer than cigarettes but help me kick the habit overall. 

Now, I've realized that hookah is just as bad for you. I would appreciate links or any information I could get on hookah, especially in use to quit smoking cigarettes. As of right now, I'm done with hookah, as well, but I do think I'd like to use it as a crutch for a few more days. (I know, I'm weak :/ )

Any advice? I'm a 19 year-old female who lives with her grandmother who smokes a pack or more a day and refuses to quit. The temptation is too much for me. HELP.

So done with cigs. I take control of my life right now.

Last September, I quit from 9/3/13 until 12/15/13, and I relapsed.  I have been smoking ever since, but today I'm done with this for good.  I dont care who smokes around me, or how much I crave it, I WILL NOT light up again.  I have two small chidren, and a fiance' that love me dearly, and I can not put them through me killing myself.  

I also am doing this for me.  I want to be able to workout and not gasp for air.  I want my clothing and car to smell nice.   I want this part of my life to be behind me.  Kudos to all of you too, whether it be your first day or 10,000th day, we're in this shit together.

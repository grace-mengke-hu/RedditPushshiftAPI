Hit 2 weeks and this is my first post

Hi everyone! This is my first post but i've been lurking around here for a few months now. I had smoked for almost 7 years and I quit May 9 before I left on a family vacation for 12 days and surprised myself at how well I did. I barely even thought about smoking because I was constantly busy and surrounded by my family who I refuse to smoke around. I'm pretty ashamed of smoking and didn't want them to know I had such a nasty habit. It helped that I wasn't in my normal routine so certain activities didn't trigger me to smoke, and it wasn't easy for me to get cigarettes even when I really wanted one. 

I got back a couple of days ago and the cravings got really bad :( I guess because I was back to my reality and certain places and times set me off. Unfortunately I bought a pack of cigarettes when I went to the store today and came home and took a drag. It immediately disgusted me and although part of my brain wanted to smoke the whole thing I put it out, felt like shit and walked to the park to throw the brand new pack in the trash (I didn't want the pack in my possession because it might be too tempting). It was kind of empowering and I realize how much my body has healed in just 2 weeks. The cravings suck, but I'm gonna get through them now that I realized how shitty those things taste and make me feel. Maybe I just needed that drag to prove to myself that I don't need them. *sigh* Part of me feels like I should reset my badge, but then again does one drag constitute me throwing away 2 weeks of good work?

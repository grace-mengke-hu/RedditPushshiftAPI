I need a new plan.

Every time I have a pack of cigarettes I tell myself this is the last one. I can go a pretty good amount of time without smoking, HOWEVER I smoke weed and love cigarettes when I'm high. A week ago I went four days without a cigarette, didn't even really want one... bought a pack when I was high. It's almost like when I don't smoke for a few days or a while and I buy a new pack, I smoke SO much more than I usually do when I smoke every day. I don't smoke weed every day, but can't help but fall into the trap every time. 

Is there anyone who has a similar experience that can help me with those urges? I don't want to stop smoking weed, and when I'm with others who DON'T smoke when I'm high, I won't even crave one. It's when I'm alone that it gets me. I've also recently been dealing with a good bout of depression because I moved away from all my closest friends, I've been struggling a lot with money & I've been isolating myself. My boyfriend gave me a couple grams of weed and I was smoking a lot to avoid having to think. I haven't smoked weed in a week or so but still have this nasty pack of cigarettes. Help :(

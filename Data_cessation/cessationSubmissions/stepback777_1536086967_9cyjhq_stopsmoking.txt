2 years cig free :)

Hi all,

2 years cig free for me and for all the people battling through the first few days/weeks it can be done and does get easier.

For me I smoked 20 per day and had no intentions of stopping. Until my partner fell pregnant... Well kind off. The pregnancy never turned out as planned and unfortunately we were given more devastating news the same day at the hospital , without going into to much detail we were told the only way we could have a child was through IVF so the smoking had to go or no IVF. After that news I had 1 last cig and said that would be the last. 

When you have a reason like that where you have to stop your mindset changes. For me the first night was really difficult. Also breaking the routine of when you would have a cig makes you think about them for a while, like after meals or with a coffee but it gets easier. After that night I used a vape pen for a few weeks dropping nicotine strength every few days.

My health has for sure improved looking back. No more grunting cough especially in the morning.

Fast forward - IVF worked first time for me and my partner and we now have a 5 week old daughter :) 

It gets easier as time goes on. Good luck everyone and heads up.

I'm having a lot of trouble quitting smoke

Today is my 25 birthday and I been smoking cannabis since a young age (more than 10 years now) I feel like I'm destroying my self and I don't know what to try know
I'm so used to that I feel I can't do nothing without beeing high everyday
I really feel desperate by now
Any advice from the good people of Reddit?

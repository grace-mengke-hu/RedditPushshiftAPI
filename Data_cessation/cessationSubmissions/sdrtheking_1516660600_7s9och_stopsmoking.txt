Almost 4 weeks now.

I stopped smoking not as a new years resolution, but just realized I was ready, on December 28th.  To be fair I switched to vaping but to be honest I don't crave cigarettes anymore, my teeth are whiter, I don't smell like smoke, and I can smell and taste things SOOOO much better now. I know it's considered a crutch but different people have different methods, I'l eventually cut this down to 0 nicotine and be done completely, but for now I'm relishing in a small victory. Hope this may motivate someone to try something new and stop cigarettes if traditional methods aren't working too well. Cheers!

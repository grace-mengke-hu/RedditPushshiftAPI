Today was a tough one.

I haven't craved for a few weeks. I've been getting healthier and exercising more so things were looking up for the quit, but this morning was tough.

It is the Monday after Christmas vacation and we have to get the kids (and one rabbit with two cages) back to school and daycare.At 1:45am we get a text from our neighbor saying she just found lice on her kids and also asked us not to hate her. She asked us not to hate her because one of our kids had slept there the last two nights. 
So there we all are at 2am checking each other like a troop of chimpanzees. Turns out only the one child has it. The kids are pissed at us for waking them, but we had to check. So from 2:30 until 7:30 we had to go to the store, get the lice shampoo and comb, come back, delouse the kid, comb out the nits in long hair (two hours), sanitize all the bedding, clothing and stuffed animals (four huge loads) and it was all done in time for school at 7:45. Exhausted kids and class rabbit (and all her shit) all made it to their destinations on time. I looked at my wife in the passenger seat and say "I really need a cigarette." and she goes "If you can handle that and not smoke, you can handle anything." so here I am at work silently cursing her out for being right.

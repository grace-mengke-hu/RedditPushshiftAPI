Root cause of my many ailments

Just realized my ocular migraines are caused by smoking. The terrible back pain I get periodically is caused after a nasty spate of coughing. Poor sleep, lethargy during the day, intermittent chest pains. The looming threat of lung cancer, copd, or emphysema. Cardiac arrest/heart attack or stroke. All real potentials. The fuck am I doing this for again?? Its not even that great. Oh yeah, yellowish teeth, bad breath and stinking living space/clothes. What a winning activity to engage in! I thought I'd be slick and switch to rolling my own, saving money and smoking untreated tobacco. NOPE! No way around it. Its all or nothing, there's no in between with this one. I personally cannot be a casual smoker, there's no such option for me. Its chain-smoking or nothing. That's it, no other choice. The cravings are not even nearly unbearable, its just a mental obsession and pattern of behavior that needs to be broken. Like, forever. So I just threw away my tobacco and paraphernalia. Lets try this again, no other choice really. The cost is too ridiculously, absurdly high. Bye tobacco.

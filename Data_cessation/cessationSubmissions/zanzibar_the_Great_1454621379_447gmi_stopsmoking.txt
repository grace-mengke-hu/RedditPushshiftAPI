I feel like we're going about this wrong.

I like the direction where going with anti tobacco ads but I feel like we need to be more aggressive. 

Now I'm genuinely a nice person and I hate putting others down but everybody knows how dangerous tobacco is. These 7000 dangerous chemical ads only tell smokers what they already know. 

My stance is to some way make smokers feel like lesser people for smoking. Unfortunately it isn't too politically correct but I feel like it might help. 

Like say we get Samuel L Jackson in an ad where it's just him saying smoking cigarettes is fucking retarded. You dumb mother fuckers. Like I would hate if Sam Jackson told me I'm inferior. 

I know this is rude and quiting is very difficult and I hope not to offend anybody.

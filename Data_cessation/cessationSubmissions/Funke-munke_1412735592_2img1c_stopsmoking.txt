Want to quit but terrified

Whenever I think about quitting I get this increasing feeling of panic. It is what holds me back every time. I quit using the Allan Carr method for approx two months and I am back on about 1/2 pack per day.  I detest the habit but somehow feel it's my little treat. I start to panic when I read the words "never smoke again". Any tips on how to alleviate this panic

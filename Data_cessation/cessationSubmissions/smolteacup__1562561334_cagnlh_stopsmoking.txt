Had to put my dog down on Friday. I had one cigarette, I was 3 weeks smoke free. I don’t feel good about it, but I don’t feel like I should beat myself up.

Putting my sweet dog down was just a shit show. I am heartbroken, she was my angel for 14 years.
When my friends came over they had cigarettes and I just really wanted one so I did. I smoked one.

Last year I picked up the habit to cope with the sadness  when my ex kicked me out of his house.
I got committed to quit a month ago... I was three weeks smoke free, but I couldn’t help it.  I felt so angry, confused, sad, nostalgic, fragile...
I still want to quit, I don’t want to be a smoker.

Also I miss my dog.

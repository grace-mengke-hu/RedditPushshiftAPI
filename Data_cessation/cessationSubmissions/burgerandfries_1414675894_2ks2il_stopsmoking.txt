Cake Day! What a year...

Last year I decided that I was going to quitting smoking and try to get  healthy.  At 55, it was time to quit them forever.  I say forever as I have quit twice before.  Once for 5 years, once for 10.  So now it time to do it and a lot of other things to get back to enjoying life and now just setting on the couch, smoking a nail and swilling a 6 pack. 

So I quit.  I gained about 5 lbs too.  That's ok though!  Hell, I was already 60-70 overweight anyway.  At least I quit.  I went skiing last winter and could hardly get down a run without stopping and gasping.  But I never looked back.  I chewed some nicotine gum (only 1-2 a day) for about 2 months and then stopped.

Felt great getting my breath back and food sure tasted a lot better.  Oh yeah, the wife says I quit heavy snoring about a week after quitting.  

By May a few more lbs had got packed on and I was getting restless anyway so I called a friend and made a pact to walk and get fit.   And I mean Every day too.  So for the last 6 months we have gone from 1 mile a day to 4 miles day and longer on weekends.  I do a strength routine 3 times a week and have packed on some good muscle.  As of today, I'm down 39 lbs. (26 more to go)  I plan on skiing as many times as I can this winter and then fly to east coast to meet my first Grandbaby in March.  I'm making sure that I have a long time to spend with her.

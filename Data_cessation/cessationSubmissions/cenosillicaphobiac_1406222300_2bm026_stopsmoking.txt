I smoked yesterday

No reset required!  It wasn't tobacco!  Off and on I'm a daily weed smoker, currently it's off, meaning it's only occasional now.  Yesterday marked the second time I've smoked weed since starting this journey.  It actually felt horrible in my lungs and I've got more phlegm than I am used to, and it tasted awful, something I'm not used to.

For my birthday, I've asked for a vaporizor.  Even with only occasional weed usage, I want it to be smoke free.  It never phased me before, it was just a little more smoke in my lungs.  Now it feels invasive.

Day 90! Just had to brag a little, it's the second time I've made it this far quitting and I'm very optimistic about remaining a non smoker. Feel free to ask questions about the process.

It's been 90 days, no cheating, no prescriptions, and just going cold turkey. 

Started off kinda rocky but it's been getting easier by the moment.

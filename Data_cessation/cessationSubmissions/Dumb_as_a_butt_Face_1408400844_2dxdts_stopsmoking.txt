How long should I give myself before a "reward?"

Sixteen year smoker up until last night. I'm using gum to start, and survived the first day. After making several attempts in the past, this time my wife and I are setting up a substantial reward. My vehicle needs replacing in the next couple of years, but if I can finally kick the cigarettes, we'll do it sooner. Setting up this significant of a reward is the first time where I've felt like it will work. Every other time I've quit, I did not go into it with much hope.

My question is, how long should I give myself to receive the reward? It needs to be close enough that I can see the end, but long enough that the quitting is legit. Is three months long enough for quitting to have set in? Does it need to be six months?

Thanks for your advice. I'm excited. This is the first time I've ever felt like I can do this.

Day 3, so far so good.

I'm on day three smoke free, what should I expect other than the withdrawal? I work out, been smoking for 13 years, should I start trying to push my runs further off the bat or is there an optimal time frame? 

I'm going warm turkey, I have a nicotine vape and my doctor put me on welbutrin for an unrelated issue. Those two things are making this very easy, but it's only been 3 days. 

Any advice?

I want to stop but can't completely - anyone have experience with 'cheat days'?

Haven't had one since Sunday and came close to cracking many times but keep telling myself I'll treat myself at the weekend when I have a few beers. Vaping this week has worked but I'm intrigued by what I do at the weekend...the thought of never smoking again overwhelms me and makes me just wanna say 'fuck it I'll never last anyway'.
Anyone have experience with cheat days - how did that go? Is it possible to just smoke if an evening when going out/Christmas/birthdays and vape the rest of the time or does it become more and more difficult to not revert back to old ways every Monday that in inevitably ends in failure?

Newfound benefit of quitting

I was originally SO FRIGGIN BORED because of all the extra time i had on my hands, but I've come to realize that the boredom has translated into me not hating my job. Let me explain. 
I get up at 530 am and go to work and don't get home til around 730ish in the evening. I used to hate my job because of the long hours. I was so bitter because i "never had time to do anything that i needed to after work" such as cleaning my house or giving my pets attention and love or running errands. The first few days of my quit it dawned on me that i had so much more time to be bored. I hated it. Lol
Now, i have come to notice that not only do i have more time, I'm actually using it properly. I don't procrastinate by "smoking first" so i just get stuff done. Suddenly my home is always clean and tidy, there's food in the house, and i even manage to have me time to pamper myself or chillax and watch netflix and still get like 6 hours or more of sleep at night. 
I don't hate my job anymore because i still find time to knock things off my to do lists. Now my weekends are spent actually having fun or relaxing instead of catching up on chores and errands (making each task seem so much bigger and longer with all the smoke breaks). I am a much happier, healthier person and i have never been more pleased with myself or my life. Now that the procrastination crutch is gone, I'm actually living like a human adult who handles her responsibilities well. I'm about to be 31. It's about damn time! Haha

Have i mentioned how damn happy i am lately!? ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„

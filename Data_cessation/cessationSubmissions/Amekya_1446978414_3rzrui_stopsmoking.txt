My only vice

Ok, so I don't drink. Chocolate, I can take it or leave it. And I'm gluten free so dont tend to hav cakes biscuits or pastry shop. The one thing that's bad for me is smoking and I'm quitting that in five days time! Feel a bit hard done by that I will lose my only vice. Guess that's why my multiple prior attempts at quitting haven't worked. What to do ðŸ˜•

Relapsed

I broke down and had a cigarette. It tasted even more disgusting than I had imagined lol. I'm not resetting my quit date because it was just one, as long as it is just one. I know people have different opinions about that but it's what I'm choosing to do. When I started all this 9 months ago, I made it 26 days without a cigarette (although I was also taking the nicotine lozenges regularly) before giving in so I guess I'm making progress lol. I'm not justifying it. But I'm just going to pick myself back up again. If I have one lapse that's not the end of the world. It's not about being perfect, it's about not smoking again. I guess I just always underestimate how hard it's going to be.

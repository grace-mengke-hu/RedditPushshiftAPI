Restarting :(

Hey, just a back story, I stopped smoking and decided to 406 days ago, but ill have to restart that. I am 15 (16 in a week!) and unfortunately I have gone back to smoking, im back at 3 packs a day. 

I don't know how to stop again, ive lost all motivation. I go through cigs so fast, I don't enjoy them at all, I just do it because I can be distracted. I also do it because I dont care if it kills me. 

I just have lost all my motivation to quit. 

Back to day 1

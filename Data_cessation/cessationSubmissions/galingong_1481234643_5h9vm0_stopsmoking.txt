Checking in at 30 days

I stopped exactly a month ago after 12 years of smoking a pack/day (m/28). It's been amazing, I'm never going back. I've had some ups and downs, but I have to say that after 2 weeks passed, it's been a piece of cake. Done. Not hard at all, anyone could do this. Everyone should actually. I can't believe that I'd been doing it for a decade.

Things that helped me a lot and might be helpful to those, starting now:
- The thought that helped me most - No matter what, smoking will only make things worse. It will not make anything better.
- I'm not a smoker anymore. I feel and act accordingly.
- I stopped drinking alcohol for the first 3 weeks. I'm by no means a heavy drinker, 1-2 evenings a week, but I decided to ditch even that. Alcohol might have tricked me into smoking :)

I can't describe how glad I am that I've made the right choice. 3 weeks ago I wouldn't have believed, but I feel content. The emptiness that I experienced in the beginning (and every time before, when I couldn't smoke), is now completely gone.

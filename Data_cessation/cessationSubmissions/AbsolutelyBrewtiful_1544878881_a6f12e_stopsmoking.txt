Disappointed

After little more than a year, I found myself picking the habit up little by little. It was one here, one there until I ended up buying a pack which turned into another, then another.
I’m so disappointed in myself. I feel that I’ve let my family down. They were so proud of me.
I don’t want to be a smoker again. Hopefully, by joining this group and posting I can break the habit. Again...

I was/am a stress-smoker.

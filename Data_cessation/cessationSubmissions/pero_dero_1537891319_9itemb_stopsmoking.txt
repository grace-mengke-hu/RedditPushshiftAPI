Day 4, angry all the time without even noticing it

I've been taking tobacco pouches for 3 or 4 years until I decided that this friday would be my last day of using - Oh and I hope it's ok to post here since it isn't smoking but still nicotine addiction. 

I've been holding out quite well. Temptation has been everywhere and I've still managed to say no. But I have a problem: I'm angry as hell without even noticing. Today one of my roommates asked me if everything is ok because I seemed like being ready to blow any moment. Looking back at my past social encounters I've noticed people distancing themselves, some people even looking frightened of me (especially cashiers). I'm a big guy and I'm bald, bearded and very direct when I speak. This isn't a problem since I often smile and try to look positive, but apparently for these past days I've been looking and acting like I could explode at any time. 

I feel bad about my behaviour and the way I've presented myself. I don't like the fact that I've not been myself these days and not even being able to notice. 

So fellow quitters; do you have any tips or advice as to how I can keep my emotions in tact? How long can I expect this to last?

After 40 years of smoking today my father died of lung cancer.

We have had the diagnosis for 1 year and its was a ever accelerating decline from that day. Shaken from morphin induced hallucinations I died today after 64 years, well below the average life span for the region and Brithdate

I have made my choice 3 years ago after almost 15 years of smoking.  If you smoke and plan to have children, remember that you might miss on some of the most exciting years in their life.

The 5th

I have smoked for I think 23 years. Quitting for a year here and there. Tried almost everything you can imagine... Cold turkey, step down, gum, patches, don't drink, only smoke when you drink, only weekend smoke, hypnosis​, getting a tattoo that says "commit", auricular therapy, hypnotherapy.....I know I forgot a few.

This year was the hypnotherapy, which was excellent. But then I rewarded myself with a cig on St. Patty's day for being 1 1/2 weeks smoke free. DERP!

Now a few months later I am on day 5! I have been getting acupuncture​ for a bulging disk. The Dr. mentioned when my treatments began that he could treat addiction. It is really helping. Still hard at nights......but day 5 so far.

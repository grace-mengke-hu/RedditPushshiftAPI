If I share with you my story.. would you share a.. cig.. with me?

An old user of the internet, let's say since I was 4 yrs old. Today I am 18 years old and I'd like to share you my story.
I've been smoking since I was 16, that makes it almost 1yrs and a half of smoking.
People told me that if I try to quit as early as possible it would be a hell-lot easier. Got to agree. I used to smoke between 2 and 12 cigs everyday (depending on my money, place, friends, etc). In this very particular moment it is 36 hours without a cigarette. I've got nauseous a lot (like moments when I almost lose consciousness) and easily iritable. 
The thing is, I'm commited to quit. I read a lot of things on this board.
Already applied for a badge and I have to ask: what are the best tips to quit?

UPDATE: every thought about cigars would just add up to the hatred I started to built, I feel like there are not going to be any more urges to smoke

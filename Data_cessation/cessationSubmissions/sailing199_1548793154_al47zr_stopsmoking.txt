What tips do y’all have on mitigating the urge to smoke?

I am currently 22, and have quit smoking several times for multiple months. Right now I haven’t smoked in a week, and really want to make this time permanent. However, I know that at certain times (it’s the worst when I get bad anxiety, which I am working on, but I want other advice besides working on that) I will get a major urge to go and buy cigarettes. What are some ways you guys have found that has helped you fight this urge?

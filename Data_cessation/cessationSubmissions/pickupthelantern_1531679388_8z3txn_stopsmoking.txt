Trying to quit for the (real) first time!

I've been smoking since i was 17 (I'm 25 now)  and I smoke 1 pack or maybe 1 and a half pack a day.   
I've always been a healthy person, I love sports and going to the gym, but i started working on a full time job (8 to 5) in the last year and left behind my healthy lifestyle.   
I was 90 kgs (in my best shape ever) now i'm back on 100kgs, smoking alot and also drinking (socialy).   
I'm trying to ditch my bad habits and go for a healthier and cleaner life style.   
I've been researching online for information and tools to help me quit smoking and found Allen Carr's book as a sugestion, here on reddit.   
I'm going to start reading it today and focus myself on leaving this bad habit behind.   
While working I get no real craving for a smoke, the real problem is on the off time, like at home.   
I try to get myself distracted by surfing the web or play online but sometimes it's worse.   
I hope that trying to quit smoking and going back to the gym more regulary can be a good combination to achieve the type of lifestyle i want for me.   


I'm sorry if there is some bad spelling, english is not my first language because I'm from Portugal.   
Thank you for reading and good luck for those who are on the same page as me!

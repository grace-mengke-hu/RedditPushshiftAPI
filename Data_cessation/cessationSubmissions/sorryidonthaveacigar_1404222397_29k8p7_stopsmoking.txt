5 days and my head is getting crazy

So, i try to relax, doing everything with calm but it feels like my head, each time I come across a difficult situation, is going to make me go crazy (or just light a smoke). Does anybody else's feels this way? Like my mind is playing tricks, trying to convince me I need to smoke?

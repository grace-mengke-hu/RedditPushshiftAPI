2nd Day, Hard Decision

Today has been a great day.  I am 17 and Captain of a Cyber Defense team. Today I competed for the last time for 6 hours working to secure a Windows 2008 Server. We ended it off on a great note, I scored the last 8 points needed to put us in the first place spot for Silver Teams in the nation.

I drove to Pizza Hut and was waiting for my order when I decided to walk across the street to grab a drink.  I noticed a full cigarette next to the ashtray.  I went inside and had a serious internal debate on whether or not to take it. I have only been not smoking for 41 hours. I decided I wouldn't. And I am very proud of myself for it.

It was extremely difficult. But a decision and obstacle I am glad to say I overcame. Thank you guys for letting me read your stories and feel open enough to post mine. Have a great day.

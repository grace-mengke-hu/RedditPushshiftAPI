I accidentally quit smoking again 36 hours ago. How do I keep riding that wave?

Basically I smoked the last of my tobacco and somehow never got around to going out and buying a new pack. The withdrawal symptoms since then have been minor (couldn't sleep as well as usual yesterday, because I kind of wanted a cigarette, but that passed quickly and with little effort, which is unusual). Now, how do I keep this going? 

Since the withdrawal has been so mild, and all the nicotine should be out of my system very soon, the biggest danger now should be the habit of smoking itself, right? 

Should I find some replacement habit for my hands/mouth to do at times I would usually smoke? Or should I temporarily change my other habits to avoid even getting into a typical "smoking situation"? I think if I can keep myself from actually *buying* new tobacco, this should be easy to continue.

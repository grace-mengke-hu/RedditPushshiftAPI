I'm trying to get my parents to quit, any advice?

My parents have been hooked since they met in the Navy in like 1989. My mom smoked while she was pregnant with me, not heavily but she still did. I've grown up with the smell of the second hand smoke and recently I've wanted them to quit. They've tried quitting a lot of times, usually with nicotine patches, gum, or e-cigs. They know how much money they would save, what the health benefits are, but they just can't do it. What are some ways I can help? I have one. I don't really help them around the house much, they never ask, but they do work really hard on simple shit like chores. I would be okay with doing most of the chores split between my 2 siblings (1 older 1 younger), but I want to know how long I'd have to keep that up. Like, at how many weeks would their stress levels go down?




I'm mostly just looking for ways to comfort them on their journey. I don't know the best way for them to go about it, but from the limited research I've done it'd be cold turkey, right?




Thanks guys.

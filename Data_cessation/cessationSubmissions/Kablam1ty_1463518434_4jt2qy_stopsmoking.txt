threw my cigarettes into a bag of marinara


I know me.
I know that I will venture deep into that disgusting garbage bag to hopefully unveil an un-marinara'd cigarette and smoke the hell out of it.
Hense why i took them out of the carton before tossing them into that once delicious and now spoiled slop of marinara sauce.
Bought a logic pro. Began studying computer science.
I have stepped into a path I thought was beyond my reach. Now that I understand the potential I am flirting with..I am excited to continue this path.
Fuck you cigarettes
Thank you marinara

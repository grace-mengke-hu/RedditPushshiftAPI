Random crying

Guys, I'm an adult in his thirties. Quit two years ago, relapsed a month ago (shisha is a gateway drug yo), and quit again 25 hours ago. 





I watched a sad video on YouTube and started crying and wouldn't stop for 30 mins. I have no idea why I was crying and the video wasn't even that sad. But I couldn't stop. It felt so damn good to cry.





I'm your typical dude. I can't remember the last time I cried. I am so glad that I was alone.





What the hell just happened? This never happened first time round. Have you experienced such?

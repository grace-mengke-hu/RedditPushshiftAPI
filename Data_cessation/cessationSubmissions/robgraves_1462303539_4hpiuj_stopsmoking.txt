1000 days smoke and nicotine free

Well it will be in a few hours.  I smoked for 17 years and near the end I smoked 2 packs a day, i.never thought I'd actually quit.  I started trying to quit seriously back in 2011 but had many false starts and it took a while before this quit which now had nearly 1000 days.

Two weeks today. Moral support, anyone? Please?

Hello. I'll try to keep this short.

Today is my 14th day clean of cigarettes. Been smoking since I was 20, I'm 24 now. I have anxiety and depression plus some minor stuff; cigarettes used to help me keep my head level so I am dealing with that shit on top of the cravings.

I quit cold turkey. Bought some nicotin patches but I don't like how they make me feel. To make it worse I live with my mother and she still smokes. This means I still feel the smell of cigs on a daily basis and I have access to cigarettes at all times, just across the hall, and that knowledge is grating.

It's about 2am where I live. I'm alone, my mother's asleep, insomnia struck, depression is eating at my nerves and I coud *really* fucking use a cigarette right now. Could somebody say something nice? Hell, even saying shit could help, it'd keep my head busy.

Thank you all.

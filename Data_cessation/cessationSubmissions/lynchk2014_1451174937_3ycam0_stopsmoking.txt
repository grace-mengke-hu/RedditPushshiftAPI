My story :)

Hi everyone! Just wanted to post a little something about me. I'm a registered nurse and I've been smoke free for 12 days! I started smoking in college socially, as a way to make friends. It didn't take long for me to get addicted, and pretty soon I realized when you are a smoker there is ALWAYS an occasion to light up. Stressed - smoke. Passed a test - victory cig. Bored - smoke. Tired - smoke. Uncomfortable social situation - smoke. Hanging with old friends - smoke. Ect. I always said I would quit after college. After all, I was in nursing school and I knew all the bad things cigarettes can do to your body. After school I found a job at a great hospital, but it wasn't a smoke free facility. Almost all of the nurses I work with are smokers and we always took turns going out in pairs to get our nicotine fix. I was self-conscious though, and I often felt hypocritical. It's part of my job to educate patients on the importance of smoking cessation and give them tips to quit. Well on December 14th I decided to take my own advice. I bought myself some nicotine patches and downloaded an app called smoke free on my iPhone to track my progress and I have to say I'm very proud of myself. I've had several past failed attempts at quitting that only lasted 12 hours at most. I haven't allowed myself a single puff and I'm still holding on strong! Congratulations to everyone who has made the decision to be a nonsmoker! We can do this!

Finally ready to quit, but not sure where to start.

So I think it's finally time. I've said it a million times before but I think I'm actually ready. My girlfriend and I just moved to a new city in December. She quit and has been on me about it for a while. I'm 25 and have been smoking a pack a day (give or take) for ten years. My girlfriend is making honest attempts at bettering herself. I'm not stupid, I know that if I don't change with her there is a possibility that I could lose her and that it something I do not want to happen. I was supposed to try and quit this week but I guess I just don't really know where to start. I do have a history of mental health problems and I'm a little concerned that quitting could exacerbate them. So I guess I'm just not really sure what to do. Any advice that anyone has, literally anything, would be a big help.

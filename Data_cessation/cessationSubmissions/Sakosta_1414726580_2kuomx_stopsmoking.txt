Resetting the clock

I was doing pretty well. I had a month and a half of no smoking under my belt. This past weekend I went to a wedding and broke down when my whole crew was smoking. I continued to smoke up until today. I smoked the last cigarette from the pack I bought yesterday morning. This time I'm trying cold turkey. They say it's the best way. I wish you guys all the strength I lacked. It's definitely doable. I'm not the only person ever to quit. I have to keep reminding myself of that.

Is anyone else getting this one at the moment?

My inner voice has been pissing me off today, saying pretty much anything it can think of, to try and get me to smoke, for example: "You've done so well, almost 2 weeks without a cigarette."Why don't you have a drink, to celebrate, and a smoke as well?" And: "Seeing as your so determined to stay quit this time, there's absolutely no way, having 1 or 2 cigarettes will cause any problems what so ever, in fact, by smoking again, you're much more likely to succeed, as it will show you just how iron clad your resolve is, by being able to stop and start at will." It's pathetic really, but at the same time, quite disturbing.

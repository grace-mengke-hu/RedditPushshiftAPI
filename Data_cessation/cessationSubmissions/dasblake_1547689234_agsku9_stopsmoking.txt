Yea tho I walk into my neighborhood bar.

I quit made the decision to quite smoking last month, I’ve had trouble with it, there was holiday stress and external excuses that made me relapse. I’m at day 4 on this new and final attempt. I want to be able to live my life but without a cig.  I’m putting the team on my back right now and not smoking for all of us. 

FYI: never posted here before, 99% doing this to occupy my mind and help avoid the craving

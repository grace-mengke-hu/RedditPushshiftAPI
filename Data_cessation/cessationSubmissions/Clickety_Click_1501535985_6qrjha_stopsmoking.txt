I passed 24 hours!

It has been 24 hours and 35-ish minutes since my last cig. I am using vape to help me quit, no hate please, it's helping me.

This is the first time in many many attempts I have hit 24 hours. but this isn't an attempt. I'm going to do it. We can all do it! :D

Edit: I have been smoking for 16 years on and off, mainly on. That's more than half my life. Scary to think about.

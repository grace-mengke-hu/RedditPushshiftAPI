229 and counting

Haven't been on here in a while and just wanted to stop by to say im on day 229 and if i can do it so can you. Here's a few tips i can give that helped me out:
1. stop going out until you are 100% sure you can handle smelling smoke and seeing people smoke.
2. stop drinking until you are 100% sure you will not need that cigarette with the beer. they go hand in hand. and when you do decide to drink take it very slow. if you think you can't control yourself yet then dont keep drinking.
3. as shitty as this might be, distance yourself from your smoking friends and family. let them know you're quitting and that it's not personal. in some cases they might even see how good you're doing and be inspired to quit also.
4. get a quit smoking app. i use QuitNow Pro and it is amazing.
5. occupy your time. idle hands are the devil's workshop. play video games. exercise. anything to keep you busy.
6. occupy your mouth also. eat seeds, chew gum, suck on big pretzel sticks or licorice. 
7. i think most importantly is to learn to not think a smoke will ease your stress. it's just a crutch.

Everybody ends up having their own way of doing it I'm sure but hopefully some of these ways can help you.

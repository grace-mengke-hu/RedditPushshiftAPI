Need advice please I beg you

I have been smoking for 10 years now, and I am trying to quit for a month now but every time I walk past a shop I'm a different person, 6 out of 7 times I don't even know how I get a cigarette in my hand, I relapse every day ðŸ˜­
I'm alone and no friends to support me, it's been motivational whenever I see a post here but I can't control it I need help
I even called the emergency service but they have no response
Someone please help me
This post is not what I want to do but there is a story behind it but I don't care I just want to stop this my dentist said there is a 70% chance that I don't have mouth cancer, but I don't care I don't have anyone to talk to ðŸ˜­
I just want to know how I can get over the carvings, sometimes I don't even remember buying the cigarettes
I have anxiety, every day first cigarette gives me an anxiety attack and I still can't get over it, please someone help me ðŸ˜­

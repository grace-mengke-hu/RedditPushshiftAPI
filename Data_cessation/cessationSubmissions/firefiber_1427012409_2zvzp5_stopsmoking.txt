I quit today morning.

I had my last cig yesterday night. I'm currently at work, it's the 22nd of March, 2015.  

I've been able to cut down more or less to between 2 and 4 cigs a day. Usually not during the day, it's always during the evening. Yesterday night I decided I've had enough. I need to stop giving myself excuses like "oh but I've cut down so much, two cigs won't hurt!". 

The reason I've failed so often is because when I get home after a long day at work, I have nothing to look forward to, so I've created a habit around smoking. 

But there are other things I can look forward to! Like Battlefield: Hardline! And all of the other games I've bought on Steam that I haven't played. And messing about with Arduino. And learning to code. And cooking a good meal before bed. 

I don't need to be a slave to these death sticks.

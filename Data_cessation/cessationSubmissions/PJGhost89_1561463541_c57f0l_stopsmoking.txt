Day 4. Positive emotions!

I'm on day 4 of quitting with patches. Found it surprisingly easy so far (I've made a lot of changes in my life in the past two years towards being physically healthy and happy in my personal and work life) so I actually felt ready for this quit! 

One thing I've noticed (aside from how amazing my garden smells) is that I'm actually happier. I'm not a very emotional person, generally very direct and getting on with stuff, but I've actually found myself giggling at memes and laughing out loud and stuff on tv which is rare for me. 

Anyone else experience that or have any tips for what to expect when it comes to cutting down on the strength of the patches?

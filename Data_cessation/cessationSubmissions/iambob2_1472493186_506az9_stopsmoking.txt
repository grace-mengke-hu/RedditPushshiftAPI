this quote was part of what inspired me to quit - particularly enjoyable after a successful road trip!

“Two years he walks the Earth. No phone, no pool, no pets, no cigarettes. Ultimate freedom. An extremist. An aesthetic voyager whose home is the road. Escaped from Atlanta. Thou shalt not return, 'cause "the West is the best." And now after two rambling years comes the final and greatest adventure. The climactic battle to kill the false being within and victoriously conclude the spiritual revolution. Ten days and nights of freight trains and hitchhiking bring him to the great white north. No longer to be poisoned by civilization he flees, and walks alone upon the land to become lost in the wild.” -  Christopher McCandless, Into the Wild (movie)

I made it to 33 days, but it feels like I've changed so much. I just like to celebrate every victory, and wanted to share with you all. 

Keep it up!

quit 3 days ago, having pains

Hi guys,

Decided to post here and ask some question/advice.

I have smoked every day for about 3 years now. And I quit cold turkey 3 days ago. 

So far, I have been waking up with horrible headaches. Similar to sinus headache, but worse. yesterday it was so bad in the morning I threw up harder than I ever have in my life. 

It seems to be better today, but I notice that when I look around, my eyes are straining HARD. Anyone have this ? how long till it goes away?

anything to help with these pains?

I'm feeling nauseas as well throughout the day.

thank you everyone

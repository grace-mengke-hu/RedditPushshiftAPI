I've tried quitting before - but as they say "keep quitting until it sticks"

I started smoking/vaping when I was 14 or 15 years old-- I'm 20 now. The longest I ever quit was around 90 days, and of course I did it for a girl. Among other reasons, I need to stop now for my health and career. Along with a lot of other changes I'm going to be making in my life, this is the first step, and I'm starting today. We can do this together everyone. Whether you're 1, 10 or 100 days in: we're all fighting the same battle.

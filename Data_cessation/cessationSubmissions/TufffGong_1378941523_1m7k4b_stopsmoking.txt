Holding myself accountable,quick check in post

73 days sounds ludicrous, when I was smoking I'd get panic attacks just thinking about going without cigs for a day, now here I am 2 and a half months in. You  won't believe what you're capable of until you stop putting limitations on yourself, friends. Keep up the life saving work guys & gals.

Smoked for 30-plus yrs, pack a day. Just quit! Glad for the support here.

I've quit before for various periods of time, but I don't think I meant it. This time, I feel like I'm fully aware of what I've been doing to myself all these years: Wearing out my body, wasting money (so much money!), wasting time. I feel a little weak today, maybe missing the ridiculous lifestyle I lived for so long. But I'm still mostly strong and very determined. The posts here have helped from day 1. Thanks!

Enough is enough.

I've been wanting to quit for a year now, been making promises to myself each week that this is it now, but noooooope. I have gone days(2-7) without smoking million times throughout this period, never had a physical craving but always fooled myself into getting a pack or bumming a cigarette eventually, but this shit ends right now. it's almost 12am, I'll finish my last cig and go to bed so I can wake up with an 8 hour headstart. gave rest of my cigs to a friend of mine. 

not sure what the purpose of this topic is, guess I am just making it to make an official "fuck you cigarettes"-statement in my head, but whtaever it is, I am done. I have been smoking for good 5 years or so and I am just 20

Accidently stopped, now to keep it going

So, was out on New Years Eve and ran out of smokes before midnight. Since then I've not had one and it only occurred to me yesterday. However, now I've realised it's become rather difficult to keep the cravings at bay. 

I know that it's feasible because I did a week without even trying, so here's hoping I can keep it together this time! My drive to work isn't the same anymore though.

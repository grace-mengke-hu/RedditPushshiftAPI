Took this subs advice, and it worked. My wife just told me this morning she is quitting. Thank you!

I immediately stopped trying to encourage her to quit after the comments in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/7yrq4y/quit_6_days_ago_but_my_spouse_has_not_i_am_so/) and this morning she said "I think its time to quit," and tossed out all of her remaining smokes and asked me to pick up some mint nicotine gum, since she doesn't like my cinnamon gum.  I did so right after she went to work and took them to her for her breaks.

So proud of her, what else can I to do now to be supportive without being overbearing?

I'm tired of lying and wasting money.

I just smoked my last cigarette. I've been feeling like the worst person in the world, I have been lying to my wife. She thinks I quit a year ago. She keeps telling me how proud of me she is. But, she doesn't know that I've kept smoking this whole time. I hid the smell with body spray and gum. I'm tired of lying to her and wasting all this money on cigarettes and everything I need to cover them up. I can do it this time.

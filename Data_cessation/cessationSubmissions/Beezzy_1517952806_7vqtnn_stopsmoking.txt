I’ve been subbed here for a few years but fell in and out of smoking but haven’t posted my update

It’s been since July fourth. I spent my holiday with my dad in Montana, celebrating getting drunk with a bunch of locals and my dad pals. Alcohol definitely induces my urge to smoke so I was stepping out having a cig almost every drink. After a long night of partying, having way too many drinks and too many smokes I woke up the next morning feeling like absolute hell. I didn’t leave the bathroom and the phlem and hacking was disgusting. It was right there I told myself, fuck this I’m never feeling like this again. Yesterday marks 7 months. After six years and quitting over and over and over I think I finally broke it. Goodbye cigarettes.

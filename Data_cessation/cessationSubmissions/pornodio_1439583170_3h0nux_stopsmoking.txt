smoking weed as an ex smoker?

I've not yet been an ex smoker for enough time in my life to experiment this.

Does anyone have experiences?

I used to get anxious when high in the last years when cigarettes made me more nervous. I know this will change and I'll be able to enjoy the occasional joint again eventually.

The point is, does it bring you back into nicotine addiction? You use tobacco to roll it

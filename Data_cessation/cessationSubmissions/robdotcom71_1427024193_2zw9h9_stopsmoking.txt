311 days in and today I ask the bot to have my badge removed... I've failed and started smoking again.

Quite sometime ago I failed miserably and started smoking again. In fact now that I work as a courier (always on the road and stuck in my van) I've started smoking more heavily.
I have marked the 1st of next month as my next time I will try to give up smoking......

How long does the rage last?

Hi Stop Smoking!

Long time lurker, first time poster. I'm only 6 days smoke free (which still feels like a big accomplishment) and I am using the Livestrong App and Nicorette Lozenges (sparingly) to keep me going. My question is; how long will it take for me to be back to normal and not this spontaneous rage-monster I currently am? I'm finding myself wanting to kill my husband, fire all of my employees and flip the bird to everyone in traffic. I'm trying to remind myself that it's the nicotine withdrawals, but it sure isn't easy. 

Thanks for the support!

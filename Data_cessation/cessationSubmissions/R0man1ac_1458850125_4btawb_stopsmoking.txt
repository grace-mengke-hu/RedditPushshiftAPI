Six days!

Hey everyone, I quit again six days ago.

I'm sure a lot of you will remember my story. Started smoking when I was around seventeen. Continued smoking through my early 20's. I quit when I was 22, and I quit for *two* years. I started smoking again one day after taking ONE drag off of a friends cigarette. I quit again last October and stayed nicotine free for 100+ days. 

Some personal things happened. Family members passing, transportation and health issues. Over all I caved because I thought it would help with the stress. I figured I quit long term twice before and would be able to quit just as easily when I was feeling less stressed again.

Boy was I wrong. From January - now I have tried to quit again a dozen times, and it was harder than it ever has been before. I am now on six days, which is a huge improvement from the one day, two days that I was getting recently.

I'm more determined than ever. I am already feeling much better. Working out and practicing my yoga is a whole lot easier and definitely more rewarding. I'm glad I didn't give up, I'm glad I tried again. 

Yesterday I had to go to the ER because somehow I got glass stuck in my eye. It was there for 24 hours before I decided there was no way I was going to get it out on my own. I wanted to smoke *so* bad during this time. But I didn't. I can say I am proud of myself again.

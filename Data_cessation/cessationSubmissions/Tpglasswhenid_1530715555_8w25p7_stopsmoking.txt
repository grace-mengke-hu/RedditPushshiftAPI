Day 45 on first attempt

Well I did it! Still around smokers let them smoke in my place when hanging etc and im fine. It smells good and people look real cool doing it but ive been strong so far. As nice as it is im a non-smoker so I will not partake. The random cravings disappeared in about 10 days. I honestly couldnt remember how long its been until I looked at when I made my first post here. It sucked for a week then it was fine. Being a medical marijuana patient helped for sure as I was still smoking just not nicotine ;). Now that ordeal is done im moving on to quitting weed.

Thanks everyone for your kind words and support in the past. Reading others experience was very helpful. Good luck to everyone!

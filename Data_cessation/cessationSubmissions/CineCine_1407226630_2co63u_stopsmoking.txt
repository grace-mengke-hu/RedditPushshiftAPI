The bodily changes the pamphlets don't talk about

Since quitting Ive noticed little changes as my body (hopefully!) heals itself. I find they really help motivate the quitting. So 
just wanted to hear from others about what they experienced/are experiencing in the early stages that the "20 minutes after you quit" pamphlets don't discuss.

Since I quit (almost 3 weeks ago):

- my body is going through hormonal changes (almost like pms for the ladies out there). I'm taking a probiotic . Did this help anyone?

- I've noticed my tongue is brown. This one worries me! I'm hoping it was a side effect of smoking tobacco and will clear up. Anyone experience this?

- this time round I'm experiencing no coughing/expelling of tar, which I used to feel was a marker of my lungs regenerating...

Looking forward hearing what others are going through!

About to finish 120 Hours!!

So... I smoked my last cigarette on 15th August at 4:30 in the morning after a poker session with buddies, I am an hour away from legendary 5 day mark!! 

Tonight is the first time ever in my life when I had drinks without a single drag of a cigarette!! 

I was surrounded by all of my friends (who are all smokers btw) who were smoking the whole time but I didn't even feel the urge to even ask them for a drag here or there for the whole time which made me feel like the king of the world!!

This is just way way way too unbelievable!!

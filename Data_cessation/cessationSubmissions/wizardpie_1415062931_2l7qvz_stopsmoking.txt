I fucked up on Halloween.

I smoked about 3 cigs halloween night. Not even going to try to explain my justification of it. That being said... I did not go out and buy a pack the next day. In fact its been 3 days since that happened HOWEVER, it is trying to get back inside my head. I can feel it and its a nasty terrible feeling. Im not going back to smoking, i am going to act like it never happened and just move on as a non smoker. I relapsed but i am not going to go back to that life, huge warning though to be who successfully quit. I wanted to just have a damn smoke, now im craving one as we speak. After quit i kind of stopped thinking about them but damn. Just 3 smokes on a drunken night and 3 days later i am thinking about smoking. Im not going too, but dont put yourself thru a mini withdrawl after quitting. Just that one will make you feel like you have been smoking again for years.

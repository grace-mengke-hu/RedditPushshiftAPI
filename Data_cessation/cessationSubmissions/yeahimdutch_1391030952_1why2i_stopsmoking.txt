I'm feeling the best I have ever felt in 7 years.

Hey!

It's been 24 days now, I'm not thinking of cigarettes anymore, I catch myself thinking hey! usually I would be smoking now. Or after being busy for hours and after I'm done hey! I didn't think of smoking.

On top of that I started running and I just ran 2.5 km, it's not much but I started 3 days ago. I'm not doing that well in school but I will get there, I stopped smoking! there is nothing I can't do! :D

Keep up the good work and I love you guys <3

Edit: I smoked for 7 years

Bought a pack today

I quit a week ago. At least that was the plan.. work got crazy today and I caved and bought a pack. 6 cigarettes later I feel like crap. Mainly disappointed in myself, but I guess I don't know what to do when the days get hard and all I want to do is have a stoge? 

Sorry, this turned into a rant post.

New to this subreddit, would appreciate some advice.

So I started smoking around age 17 or so. Had the "i'll never get addicted" mentality like a true youthful idiot. Fast forward 6 years and at age 23 I'm still smoking. I've managed to convince myself that I "like" smoking and it's awful.

I just read Allen Carr's book and although I thought it was really helpful I can't manage to actually try and quit smoking as I'm afraid of failure. I have a shitty job, depressed all the time, and small bleak outlook for the future. I know I'm not living my life to my fullest and I know I need to quit cigarettes, but it's just so damn hard. I can't see myself waking up and not having that first smoke of the day or having that one after a meal or after a beer or two. It's painful. 

I would appreciate ANY advice you could give me on quitting. I'm stuck between the rational knowledge of needing to quit for my health, self esteem, depression, etc but at the same time I'm extremely scared of a world without smoking. Going places and not having that pack in my pocket, not being able to socialize with other smokers, etc etc

The hardest part is that I know I'm ruining my body, my health, and my appearance but I just can't quit...I also look really young and feel like smoking makes me appear a little older......so many excuses as I'm sure by now you can tell I justify my habit like no other.

Thanks for reading, sorry about the semi-long post, but any ex-smokers or people who are going through quitting and can extol any life advice I'd be more appreciative then you'll ever know. Thanks

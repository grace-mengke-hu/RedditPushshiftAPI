Day 1 of quitting, before getting neurosurgery.

I have been told by my surgeon that it is very important I quit smoking. I need this particular doctor to remove a piece of my skull and dura, so I'm doing it. 

But that is the only reason I'm doing it. I don't want a million reminders about all the reasons there are to quit smoking. I know all those and I hate you. I just want to know if there is any advice for somebody who WANTS to smoke, and would have happily continued if not for current external conditions? 

My boyfriend keeps saying things like "Just remember all the reasons you are quitting!". He doesn't get that those reasons make me really angry.

I'm taking Champix, which is helping. Thoughts?

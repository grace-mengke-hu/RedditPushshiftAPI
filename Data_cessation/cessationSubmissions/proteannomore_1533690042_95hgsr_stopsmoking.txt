Week Four, or Where Did Everybody Go?

This isn't the first time I've looked at things on this subreddit, nor is it the first account I've had here either. Something I noticed both before and this time around is how few people carry Four Week badges. If you look at the Badge Distribution page, you'll see that the numbers for Weeks 1-3 are comparable, but week 4 drops significantly before shooting back up for Month one. 

So it would seem that week 4 is... what? Really hard? Things seem to be getting a little better actually, my mental state seems to be returning to a healthy place. I almost feel like I've passed over the hump that signified me wanting a cigarette more than I wanted to quit. The last 3 weeks felt like *work* and I don't want to do it again. It's much harder at 40 than it was at 30 and 20. 

So, is this really the week that determines it (statistically speaking), or are the numbers just unreliable? (could be several reasons the badge distribution numbers look that way, tbh).

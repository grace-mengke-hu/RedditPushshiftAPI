Trying again

Quitting smoking. I've been on and off with it for about 3 years. I recently went almost a month then smoked again yesterday and today. 

I was at my cousin's for Christmas and we haven't seen each other in a few years. He offered to smoke weed and I followed up with a cigarette. He gave me a pack of imported smokes for the road. 

I wouldn't say I enjoy smoking but I noticed today I used it for stress relief. I'm in bed right now and my chest kind of hurts so if that's not signal enough that something's wrong I don't know what is. 

I'll be back to stop smoking tomorrow (smokes today) and I'll do my best. Thanks.

I finally feel intrinsically motivated to quit

Iâ€™ve been trying to quit for a few months now and cut down tremendously but after subscribing to this community I felt so much support for everyone who posted and felt ac actual desire to quit (something I had been missing). This is my last cigarette and I downloaded the stop smoking app. So thank you to everybody for being so supportive and helping me get to this point(:

7 days today, just checking in

This time has been different, this time I had a really healthy mind set. I was excited to quit smoking this time, I was really ready to be able to breathe and smell again and feel better. Its really true what Allen Carr says about the cravings, you can barely feel it, its not that big of a deal and no one will die craving a cig. I took the dog out late last night and I could smell the air, I live in Maine so it smells pretty amazing, lots of pine and ocean. I haven't smelled the night air in years. It brought tears to my eyes. Its the simple things. Just wanted to share that I'm hanging in this first week, and thriving (almost).

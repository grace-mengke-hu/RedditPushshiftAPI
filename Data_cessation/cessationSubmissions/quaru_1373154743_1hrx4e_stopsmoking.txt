50 days, smoke free!

Ugh.   I still cough up gross black phlegm, and I still often have craving while stressed out at work.  But it is getting easier!

Good luck everyone!  That first week sucked, and I was only able to do it because my job sent me to a field in the middle of nowhere for a week.  That was the kickoff I used to give cancer sticks the boot.

I have faced a weird situation. Maybe someone else experiences it too.

After 1 week of being smoke-free I stopped eating meat. Not because I wanted to, but because its taste makes me sick. I love meat but I literally can’t eat it anymore. Maybe it’s a coincidence that I stopped smoking almost at the same time. Or there is an explanation for it. Please share your knowledge if it sounds familiar.

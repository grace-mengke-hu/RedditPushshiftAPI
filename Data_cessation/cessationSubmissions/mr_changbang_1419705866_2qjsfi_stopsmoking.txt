Smelling like smoke, but feeling a million bucks!!!!

Been in and out of clubs tonight with people chainsmoking everywhere, but not once did I ever look at someone smoking and think "Damn I would like a cigarette now" Friend who's a pack-a-day smoker kept offering cigarettes but I've said no every single time. Honestly I find the fug and the lingering smell really repulsive now, can't believe I used to smell like that!!

For the first time in ages, I'm feeling a sense of satisfaction and happiness, a sort of "I got this" kinda feeling where I'm not dreading another New Years and another year passed, but actually anticipating whatever comes next year with enthusiasm and confidence. It truly feels amazing.

Here's to not being/feeeling/acting like a smoker anymore. Admittedly I haven't had a single drink tonight (all my relapses before had alcohol involved so I'm more cautious for the time being) but I'm feeling better than ever before. Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year folks!

Third time's a charm

In the last week I've stopped and started twice, always breaking after work on the way home. It's usually out of a mix of stress or anger. I've also been making up excuses ("It's my last week of work! I don't want to be unpleasant to be around", or "I have some serious applications to fill out, and I won't be able to focus without smoking..." 

I've decided no more. All the issues above are a lie. If I get angry, I will be pissed at the cigarettes for making me a chump, rather than myself. Here goes day 1 again.

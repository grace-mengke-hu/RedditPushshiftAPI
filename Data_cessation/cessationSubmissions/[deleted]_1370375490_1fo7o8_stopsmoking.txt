Well guys it finally happened...

After 76 days without a cigarette I finally had one of those dreaded "smoking dreams" you all had told me about. When I first quit, I was having a lot of difficulty sleeping, and posted about it here. I was probably on day 4 or so and you guys motivated me to stick with it and that things would eventually get better, but you also warned me of "smoking dreams" that many people who quit smoking eventually have. It was strange, I just remember in the dream smoking one cigarette, and halfway through thinking, "Oh fuck! Nooo 75 days down the drain!" and threw the cigarette into a toilet. It was so vivid I thought it was real. I thought I had relapsed, and would have to start all over again. When I woke up this morning and realized none of it happened I felt such a feeling of relief, and now feel even more confident that I will be able to stay away from them. Had a really tempting situation last weekend. Went to the bar with some friends and got a little drunk. Was offered cigs three different times and successfully refused them each time. Thanks so much /r/stopsmoking. I would have never made it this far without you guys.

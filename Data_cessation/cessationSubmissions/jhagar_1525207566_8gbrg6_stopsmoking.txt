4 months free, still struggling with lack of focus

Hi all,

I'm 4 months in and doing very well in terms of the quit. I don't get cravings anymore, I'm getting lots of exercise and eating well, and have pretty much eliminated drinking from my life \(was necessary for quitting\). For the most part, I feel absolutely great. 

The trouble is, I'm really struggling with focus and mental clarity, especially in the latter half of the day. I smoked for almost 20 years, and I always used a smoke and a walk as a way to gather my thoughts, either while in college or as a professional. I've tried just going for walks, but it doesn't do the trick. Neither does coffee, water, tea, etc. Has anyone else dealt with this so far into their quit? If so, did anything in particular help?

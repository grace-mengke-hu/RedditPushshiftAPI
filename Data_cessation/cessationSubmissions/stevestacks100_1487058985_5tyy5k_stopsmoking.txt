4 weeks freedom

So it's been 4 weeks to the day that I had my very last cigarette! The chains have been broken and it truly feels like freedom from the dirty smoke sticks. There are still some testing times with the odd craving. My wife went out with her mates the other day so I had my 7 month old son on my own, he definitely didn't make it easy for me and the urge to go and buy 40 cigs and smoke them all in an hour was huge. I resisted my cravings telling myself I am a non-smoker!! And coming on here and reading other people's stories was also a massive help. Anyway, I'm still smoke free! Happy days!!!! Keep it up everyone, you're non-smokers!!!!

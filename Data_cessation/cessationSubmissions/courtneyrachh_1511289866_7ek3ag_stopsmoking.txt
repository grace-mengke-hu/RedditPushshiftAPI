quit once for two years, yet here we are.

so, long story short, started smoking when i was 15, 12 years later and still (semi) at it. when i was 22 i had a blood clot in my lung due to smoking and taking the pill, so i quit for two years. some stressful events happened and i started again, and desperately want to stop. I quit for a week, then got drunk and smoked a pack. I quit for another week, got drunk and smoked two. Now here we are, a week later, and obviously I can see the repeating pattern being the whole drink thing, and am SO in need of some tips on how to avoid when drinking.

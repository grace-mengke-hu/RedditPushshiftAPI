Club 31 kicks off tomorrow. Still time to join!

December has 31 days and Club 31 is your chance to be smoke free for a month before the second half of this decade begins. A bunch have joined already in an earlier post. I've had requests to keep the idea alive. Good sign.

Join by commenting below. Open to everyone, new and current freedom fighters.

The only rule is no smoking. And please help out by making posts with "Club 31" in the title. Keep you focus positive!

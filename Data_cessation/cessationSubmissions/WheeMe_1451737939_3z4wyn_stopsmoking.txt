Well that was fun.

So I decided to quit added sugar too. So what happened is that I got low blood sugar and symptoms from that which really sucked, I thought I was going to pass out, my palms were sweaty my heart rate jumped and I got dizzy.

I'm sad to say that after I got myself together with some sugary juice I smoked a death stick. Which didn't help, it went straight to my head and I thought I was going to pass out from that.

Other than that I'm fine. The cravings have been only moderate otherwise. Then again the cravings that are about to hit me later are probably going to be a bitch.

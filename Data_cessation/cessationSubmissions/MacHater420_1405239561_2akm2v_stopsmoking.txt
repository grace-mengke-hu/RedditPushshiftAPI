How do you feel about Electronic Cigarettes? (My story inside)

I have seen that this sub is trending and I have recently quit smoking so I thought I would share my story.

So I picked up E cigs pretty much completely on a whim, and they work wonders for me. Not those 7-11 ones, those are crap. There are a lot of stores in major areas now that sell nothing but E cigs. Those are where you want to go. They are called Vape stores, or B&M's.

Feel free to ask me any questions, and head on over to /r/electronic_cigarette.

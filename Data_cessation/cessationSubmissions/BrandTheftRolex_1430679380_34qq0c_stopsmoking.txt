Loss of sex drive

Hi all.  36 year old male, 18th quit day after 20 years smoking 30 fags a day.  Feeling great and feeling confident that I will never have a cigarette again.  However, I notice that I have no desire for sex at all.  Not with my wife.  No desire to masturbate at porn.  I have no reaction to erotic images as they pop up.

I realise that this loss of sex drive or loss of libido may be a temporary side effect from quitting smoking as the body readjusts itself after years of nicotine abuse.  Nonetheless, I'm still concerned though and my wife is getting a little frustrated with this (although she prefers I maintain myself as a non-smoker).  Does anyone else currently have this experience and are worried?  Can anyone give any advice?  Did anyone else experience a loss in libido for a time only to thankfully have it return some time later?  If so, what's your story and more importantly, how long does this last!?  :)

Keep up the non-smoking guys!

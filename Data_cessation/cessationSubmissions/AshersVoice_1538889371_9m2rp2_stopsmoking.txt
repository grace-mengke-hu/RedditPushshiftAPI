Why wait??

So I just recently got a Reddit account so I could join the stop drinking group (it will be 2 weeks early Monday (3 a.mish.) it's been going really well. So now I want to tackle quitting smoking...  I was gonna wait until Monday.... but then I started thinking, Why wait?? Waiting isn't gonna help me, or make the crappy withdraw stage any more bearable.... all I am doing is giving myself one more days worth of increasing my risk for cancer... sooooooo here we go!! Here's to day 1.... at 10:15 p.m.  I need root beer barrels.

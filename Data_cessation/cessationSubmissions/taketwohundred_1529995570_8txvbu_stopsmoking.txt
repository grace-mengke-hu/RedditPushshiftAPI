Day 6 today. Wish me well! Need mid-game strategies.

I picked up the habit from my SO about 7 years ago. I've tried to quit before, and have managed to get to a month smoke-free once, two weeks smoke-free a couple of times, and a week or so multiple times.

I don't think this time feels any different so far. It's been fairly easy apart from the physical symptoms for the first 3 days which I am good at ignoring. However, I'm worried about the month mark. I would like to make it stick this time, and would like some advice on what I should be doing to keep it up.

My SO still smokes, so cigs are readily available to me. That's a slight problem but if I can keep it up, she will hopefully also try to quit soon. I really want her to quit as well, so I use this as motivation to stick to the no smoking regime. I understand that this can backfire on me - if she doesn't quit soon, my brain might convince me that I'm doing this for nothing so I might as well smoke. The brain is a tricky bastard when it wants to be!

Previous times, I just kind of gave up on the project and smoked a cig for no reason. No craving or anything, just because I was annoyed at having to "deny myself" something. And after I broke the streak, it was way easier to fall back into regular smoking. I think I have to change my mentality this time and look at it as saving myself from something horrible instead of as denying myself something fun.

Hoping for some advice I can use for the 2 weeks - 1 month period, and for how to really stick to not smoking this time.

Thanks for the amazing community here. I don't know any of you, but I am sincerely proud of everyone who is making the effort to quit and better your life. You're a hero to me.

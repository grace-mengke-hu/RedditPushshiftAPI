For People Making the Committment This coming Thursday at Midnight.

I wanted to type this for all the upcoming non-smokers coming this New Year’s. I’ve been on this sub-Reddit for a while and wanted to put up something that may help the newly initiated. It is just a brief overview of quitting ideologies, withdrawal symptoms, and advice gathered from members of the sub Reddit. I wish I could accredit all the individuals from whom I gathered information from but this is more of a collection of common themes and advice.

I do want to address my current status. While I am only 9 days smoke free, I do feel that the advice in this post is relevant and supportive. Please take from this what you will. I do believe and hope the majority of the community will agree with this information.

**Easy Way to Stop Smoking by Allen Carr**

As you peruse this sub, it is an eventuality that you will come across a mentioning of this book. The book helps dispel the myths of smoking and works to change your mentality on smoking. A few key concepts:

1. Explains the nature of nicotine addiction
2. Exposes the reasoning behind many common habits, fears, and the rationalization of smoking
3. Smoking does not relieve stress, anxiety, fear but is the cause of those feelings
4. Positivity is the key to quitting (Some feel that this isn't inherent in the book or the best indicator/aspect of the book. I would disagree on both points, I do believe it to be a large takeway)

The book works to encourage, inform, and change the mentality that quitting is a deprivation of some kind and encourages that quitting is a monumental gain. I highly recommend it (I have the audio book which was $8).

There is also a short YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATo8X4DGWaI

**Common Withdrawal Symptoms**

Everyone will have different withdrawal symptoms and some may only have a few or different combinations. These are just a few that have been expressed throughout many of the posts I’ve read (and what I’ve experienced). Yours may be different and by no means is this list all inclusive of every possible withdrawal symptom.

1.	Irritability
2.	Insomnia
3.	Increased Flatulence
4.	Inability to concentrate
5.	Increased Hunger
6.	Weight Gain
7.	Shortness of Breath
8.	Fatigue
9.	Depression
10.	Increased Anxiety
11.	Constipation

**Tips for Getting Through Cravings**

There are a variety of ways in which you can get through cravings. I’ve read the following on some other sub and thought it to be extremely relevant in this regards:

“Whether you have a cigarette or not, the craving passes”

So in reality, anything you choose to fill the time will help you get through the craving if you can distract yourself for a few minutes.

1. Drink Water
2. Go for a walk
3. Deep Breath Exercises
4. Affirmation 
a. “I do not want this cigarette” vs. “I wish I could have a cigarette”
5. Look up a stock quote, fantasy team, sports score, new recipe…

**Methods of Quitting**

The two most common ways of quitting are:

1. Cold Turkey
2. Gradual Reduction or Replacement
      - Vaping, Gum, Patches

I am not mentioning any methods involving prescription drugs, as I am not a medical professional. If this is a route you wish to take, please see your doctor.

The method in which you choose is ultimately up to you. The point is to eliminate the nicotine altogether, whichever method that achieves this, is a good method.

If someone has recommendations/advice for choosing different types of Vaping Devices, I would appreciate it (as I went the Cold Turkey route)

**Controlling Triggers**

I wanted to add an extra section apart from controlling cravings because there are certain activities that will prompt the need for a cigarrette vs the actual want of the nicotine.

Here are some common triggers and ways to avoid them:

**Trigger:** Daily Travel (Car, Train, Walking)

 A lot of times I would light up at certain visual points on my way to work. I would light up at a certain traffic light because I knew by the time I finished I would end up at work or I would notice I began having the urge to light up at the same points on my commute. It then became second nature to light a cigarrette at the mere sight of these "landmarks" even if I had just put a cigarrette out.

**Solution:** Take a Different Route

**Meals**

   - The more I eat the stronger the craving for a cigarrette afterward

**Solution:** Eat Less (and more frequently if you have to)

The following is a list of common triggers that I know of but that I have yet to come across or have not experienced myself. If any good solutions come in the comments, I will update the list

1. Drinking (I haven't drank since I quit)
2. Social Events (Haven't hung out with friends since I quit, family only and they don't smoke)
3. Coffee

**Immediate Benefits from Quitting**

I want to thank /u/coco_pops for the inspiration of this portion about the immediate benefits that are seen from quitting.

1. Smell Better
2. Better sense of taste
3. Better sense of smell
4. Not having to leave social situations periodically
5. Not having to stop at a store on a daily basis
6. More time during the day for activities (All those breaks add up)
7. More Confidence

**My Personal Experience**


I don’t even remember my first cigarette. I was 18 and black out drunk when I first had mine (A friend smoked). It’s surprising that I began. I remember that smoking a cigarette was extremely fun and pleasurable, but I never had the memory of it actually being that, even the day after. Just the knowledge that my throat and lungs burned.  I had quite a few that first night.

It started gradual. I would only smoke when I drank (and at 18 I was drinking pretty much every night, if not every other) but I would never smoke when I wasn’t drinking. Then I found the pleasure of the morning cigarette after drinking. I eventually transitioned into smoking without the alcohol. 

Again it started with only 2 or 3 a day. I even stopped drinking for a year and started exercising hardcore. But I still smoked. 

10 yrs and 2 months later I realized, I was a pack a day smoker; usually more. Sure I made several attempts. I didn’t want to smoke. I even made it past 3 days two or three times before. But I longed and ached for a cigarette. Each time, I would remember how fond it was to be smoking a cigarette right now. 

“It’s 10 am. One would be so nice.”
“Oh it’s Wendy’s. I better light up here, so that I’ll be done when I get to work.”

Every other time, I thought I was missing something from my life. That I was depriving myself and that I was of weak character because my will power wasn’t strong enough. It was a method of self harm not having these cigarettes.

None of that is true. Will power is only needed for things you want to do but can’t. Not for things you want to do. So I changed “I *can’t* have a cigarette” to “I *do not want* a cigarette”. My typical withdrawal symptoms withered in intensity along with it. 

I have never gone without a cigarette for this long in 10 years.

Hope this helps or people find this useful.

My first day as a non-smoker

i've been weaning off smoking by using vapes for the last 6 months or so. Its now time to take the leap to being nicotine free. I've quit many times before unsuccessfully. This is the first time I'm sharing with a community before. It's been a tough few days personally and I've been using that as an excuse to put this off. I'm scared and hopeful.  I hope i too have the success many of you have had. Fingers crossed. Here goes nothing!

So it's been a week...

I wanted to do it. I got a cold, decided I had to do it if I was ever going to really stop. I've been on Wellbutrin for a month now which has helped a lot, I think. I did stop and grab an e-cig, which I used at work for a while during breaks until I could stop the physical habit and find something better to do. I've grabbed it a couple times during stressful situations, but it isn't the same and it's not something I like to do the way I like to smoke cigarettes. I almost picked up a pack yesterday out of boredom. I didn't even want them that badly, I just missed the taste and wanted something relaxing to do. But I didn't. Still looking for that 2-3 minute replacement pick me up but I'm sure I'll find it.

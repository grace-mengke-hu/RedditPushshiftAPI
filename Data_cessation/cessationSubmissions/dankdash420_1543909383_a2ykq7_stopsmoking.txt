health benefits in non smokers vs those who switch to vaping?

I'm 8 days into my 2nd true attempt at putting the cigs and it's going well so far! I started at 17 and I'm 21 now, my biggest challenge to quit was the social aspect of it. But I'm over it and feeling confident that I'll be successful. I'm vaping 3mg nicotine juices until I feel comfortable with non-nicotine and I hope to eventually stop overall.

In the meantime, I'm wondering if there's a difference in the benefits of quitting (besides nicotine consumption of course) in people who stop smoking completely vs people who switch to vaping?

How to go about quitting

Hey guys, I'm 17 and have made the decision to quit cigs for good, but something that bothers me is that there are next to no resources that can make these next few weeks easier, because in my country you need to be 18 to buy nicotine gum or the patch, was wondering if you guys could give me some advice as to how to go about quitting cold turkey, thanks and have a good day you guys.

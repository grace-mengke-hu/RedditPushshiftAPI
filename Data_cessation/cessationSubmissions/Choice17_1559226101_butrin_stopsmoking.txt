WILLPOWER BEING APPLIED FULL FORCE TODAY.

I’ve been to gym, cleaned house, had healthy food but still the haunting Mr Nicotine has found a way to tempt me.
It’s ridiculous 30 days Smoke Free. And still being tempted .
I know from previous quits just one would be a disaster,  I am going to cut up some carrot sticks and make some dips.
If I eat more ice cream choc cheese I will be like ten ton Tess.  Already my jeans are feeling tight.
Just grasp hold of the nettle and get on with it.
Sorry about the moaning !

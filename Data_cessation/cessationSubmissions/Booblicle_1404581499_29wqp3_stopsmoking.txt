Well, that's interesting.

So yesterday was 4th of July. And I wasn't really thinking much about it. Never really did. Last night people in the area were lighting off fireworks. Didn't much pay attention and just played on my computer. Then my dog wanted to go out. Guess i'll see a few fireworks anyway. So out the door I went. And it smelled like I was at a gun range. Holy shit. Anyway that's all I had to say. Have a great Gun-ranged weekend!

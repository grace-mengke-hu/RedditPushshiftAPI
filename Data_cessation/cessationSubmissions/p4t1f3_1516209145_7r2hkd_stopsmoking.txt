Almos 2 months but reading is a trigger for me...

anyone else have this kind of problem. when i am reading for at least 5 minutes long it triggers me to smoke. Of course, what i am doing is stop reading in that same moment. I'm 28 and i was smoking 1 pack a day. It looks like i returned back to my mindstate previous smoking. Too agitaded to read and to be a efficient learner.

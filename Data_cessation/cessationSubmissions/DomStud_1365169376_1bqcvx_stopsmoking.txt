It's been 118 Days.

[I originally posted when I got what turned out to be the Flu](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/14h8gn/colds_and_quitting/). By far the best case of influenza ever. Thanks to this subreddit and the Flu I was able to kick the habit.

I actually can't stand the smell of smoke anymore. I can't believe I used to smell like that all the time. 

Even though I haven't posted much in here I have been lurking and  your posts has helped keep me from smoking.

Thanks!

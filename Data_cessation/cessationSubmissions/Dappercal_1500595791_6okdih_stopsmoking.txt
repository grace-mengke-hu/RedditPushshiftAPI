Day 18: Cravings for the first time in weeks

Today was sort of an interesting day... after a relatively-easy quit, I really hadn't had anything resembling a craving since day 3 or so. Until today. Twice today, I had that slightly-panicky "I just want to go outside and smoke a cigarette" feeling. It wasn't prompted by anything at all.

I was never tempted to actually follow-through on it, but it really caught me by surprise and even scared me a little.

Stay vigilant out there, gang. Even when this thing doesn't feel hard, it's hard.

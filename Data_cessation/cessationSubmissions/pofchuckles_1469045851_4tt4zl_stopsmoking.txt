DAY 44

I have come on here recently in the last 3 weeks posting about positive things such as drinking and not smoking,bigger penis! and anxiety has gone. But the last 5 days for about 15 minutes I have the worst anxiety for 15 minutes and a  complete random time and then it goes away. Something to do with quitting smoking or just a coincidence? Who else had this in their 40th days?

Anybody not only quitting tobacco but also cannabis?

Hi,I'm actually in the process of quitting both. I don't think that cigarettes will be a problem. I read Allen Carr's EasyWay a few while ago and have completely let go of cigarettes since then. However, it's the other thing that has been causing me major problems.That's not made easier by the fact that most of my friends are also smokers of weed.So I'm just looking for people who managed to quit smoking weed and who might share some tips or experiences that could help me make things easier :)Thanks in advance.

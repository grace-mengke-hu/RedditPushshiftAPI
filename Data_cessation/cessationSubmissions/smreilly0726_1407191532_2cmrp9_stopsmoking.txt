My best friend (smoker) is a huge trigger, I need help

Hi there,

I quit smoking last week. I recently stopped having those really overwhelming cravings after about day 5. I was really proud of myself (being completely nicotine free) for a even a few days. I can even hang outside with coworkers on my usual smoke break & feel absolutely nothing, rather than wanting to suck the smoke out of their lungs.

My biggest trigger was seeing my best friend on Friday night. I smoke about triple the amount when we're together. Its summer, we loved to sit outside on the deck & just shoot the shit & smoke. She isn't quitting and I had a really difficult time hanging out with her this weekend. The cravings were really strong. So much so, that I actually chose to stay in on Saturday & Sunday to 'save myself' so to speak.

For some reason she's become a huge trigger for me. Does anyone have any tips for this?

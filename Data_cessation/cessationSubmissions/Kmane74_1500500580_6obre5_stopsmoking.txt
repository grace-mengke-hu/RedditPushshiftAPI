Back to day 1

Had a slip up today with a vape. I was never a vape smoker but I bought one a week ago when I had another slip up with a nicotine vape when I was about 3 weeks smoke and nicotine free. Me and my brother got into a huge fight, he said I was going to fuck up go back to my old ways. He treated the vape like I was using crack or heroin. I told him that too and he said it's the same thing, you're going to fuck up.

He treated me so bad and it really made me mad. I've been abstaining from all illegal drugs, I drink Kratom but besides that it's a lot better than the drugs I used to use. I start college in a month and have so much stress. Living alone can be very stressful and I feel like I'm the only one. Well I posted this to help get some stress and anger out. But I'm not going back, just for today.

How To Keep Your New Year's Resolutions

I've been thinking about new years resolutions and I have some tips on how you can increase the likelihood of achieving them and what's helped me previously in life. 

*It's great to be actively thinking about your future ambitions.*

The question is how do you secure these goals, how do you make sure you will accomplish them or at least increase the likelihood of this actually occurring.

Here I'm going to talk you through some important morals, if you will, to live by when setting up new year's resolutions for yourselves to get the most out of your visions.


**Start Small**





There's a high importance of emphasizing small steps.

By starting small and placing down small, quantitive goals for yourself you have a better chance of accomplishing your bigger goal.

An easy way to look at this is fat loss.

**Let's say you wanted to stop smoking for 2017. Keep that larger, long-term goal, but as your resolution make the goal to stop for 1 week, then two, etc.**

By doing so you have a much higher chance of achieving this goal, you will provide yourself with positive reinforcement that you are indeed capable of doing so.

This makes the entire process more enjoyable because of more frequent rewards and easier as you are able to quantify it closer towards now.

The key is doing easy things that are easy not to do.

***Small strategic steps and good decisions will amount to a well-directed trajectory and eventual mass change you wish for yourself. This applies not only to fitness but every sort of goal that is quantifiable.***



**Vocalize Your Resolutions**





Speaking and talking about your goals and resolutions is a great way to keep yourself accountable.

However, there are some wrong ways of approaching this, one of the main ones being social media.

**Vocalization doesn't necessarily mean making a Facebook status about it.**

If you post a Facebook status and talk about how you're going to start a business, that's great. The problem how, ever is that you're going to receive positive feedback on this, comments and messages about how you're doing a good job.

*This validation is actually fleeting and serves you no purpose other than fuelling your laziness and unwillingness to actually work.*

Why? Let me put I this way.

Anybody can get a professional photo done, change their occupation to CEO and set up a website, this doesn't mean anything because they haven't done any work, deep work, but they still receive the validation they need to feel satisfied and at the end of the day little is going to get done.

**The best way to vocalize your resolutions if personally with close male friends or family.**

These people know you best and will offer if they are good natured, criticism, and constructive feedback tailored to your individual personality.

This will not only keep you accountable for your goals but give you a way of communicating your ideas without the prospect of nonsensical validation from people you don't actually know.



**Surround Yourself With Like Minded Individuals**





You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.

We've all heard this before and it's very true. Think about your life situation right now, be honest and chances are you are the exact average of the latter.

If you have a specific goal in mind and you want to gain strength, or make money, you must narrow your life in the direction of this goal and focus your reticular activation system (basically the focus lens of your brain) towards this goal.

Some level of focus is needed, not only in your actions you are doing but in your entire subconscious.

What I mean is that by involving the orientation of the goal not only in doing in but in aspects such as relationships and friendships will allow you to cultivate a stronger desire to achieve the goal and give you a network of availability for support, grounds of resilience and a faster ability to move towards your vision.

If you are wanting to get strong, surround yourself with strong people, if you want to get richer, surround yourself with rich people, you see the point.



***Start Now***

I want you to understand that you don't have to start the resolution on the 1st of January. this doesn't just apply to new year's resolutions but to any goal or dream you want to actualise.

**If you have a specific date where you're going to start something, but you physically and mentally have the resources and ability to start right now then you are already failing.**

The longer you wait for the more ego, the internal resistance you have in attachment to this.

There really is no excuse, this is just being empathetic with yourself and respecting yourself to make life easier for yourself I the future by achieving the goal sooner rather than later.



#**Enjoy The Journey**





This is another really important way to secure your resolutions and it's a great one to end with. For example, me writing this article right now.

Where do you think I get the most satisfaction and reward internally from this action. Is it the writing itself or the attention and validation I get from posting it, through the receive comments, etc. You may think it's the latter, but the truth is the satisfaction comes from the writing itself, the act which grounds me and pulls me into the present.

This is the journey and I want you to have this mindset in whichever goals you are trying to achieve. With a goal, there will be work that for trails any accomplishment.

Relish your soul into this work the journey, enjoy it, because this will be what you treasure and miss the most once you have actualised the goals you had.



**Take Away Message**

1. Have a long-term goal but in the now focus on short term, baby steps. Think compound interest.

2. Vocalize and express your resolutions to close friends and family that know you well, not on social media. This type of validation is fleeting.

3. You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.

4. Start the new year to destroy invested ego.

5. Happiness and fulfillment will be found in the journey itself, not the destination.
Happy New Years.

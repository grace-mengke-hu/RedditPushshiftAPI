15 June 2014 was when i smoked my last cigarette

It has been a bit over seven months since I smoked my last cigarette, but i still smoke up. Weed is not abundant here so we smoke hashish. That needs to be mixed with some tobacco. At most I'd smoke one a day and there'd be days when i won't at all.

Can I say that I have stopped smoking?

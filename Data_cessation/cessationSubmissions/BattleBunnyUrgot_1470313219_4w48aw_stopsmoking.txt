Chest hurts when I breathe in

I'm 18 and have been smoking for the last 4 and a half years. I had my last cig 60 hours ago, and now I get a sharp feeling in my chest like my left lung is tearing whenever I try to breathe in deeply. It started last night, after 48 hours without smoking. I though that if I lay in bed and relax the pain will go away, but even after a long sleep I still have this problem. Is this a side effect of quitting or should I go to the hospital? Sorry for bad english

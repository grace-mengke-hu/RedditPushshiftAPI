How I got someone that didn't like me to quit smoking.

So there was this girl in my class in college that smoked every chance she got.  I always gave her shit about it so needless to say, she didn't like that very much.  So one day I came up to her and said "Actually, I like that you smoke now."

Her:  Oh yeah, why?

Me: Well, I just bought stock in Phillip Morris.  So now every time you light up, I get paid.

Her:  ...

She quit smoking the next day.

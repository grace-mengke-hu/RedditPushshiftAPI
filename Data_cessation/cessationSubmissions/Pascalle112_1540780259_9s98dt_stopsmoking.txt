Get out the tiny violins. HELP I accidentally quit smoking, so why do I keep trying to smoke?!?

Before I start, please leave your honest comments. Good and bad. 

I’ll read them all, I’m asking for your help. 

This weekend was a weird one for me. 

Due to circumstances out of my control I needed sleep. So I slept, until 3pm Saturday. 12 hours without a smoke. I also didn’t have any and dragged myself to do grocery shopping and brought a packet. 

Got home about 5pm, put the groceries away etc. Approximately 5:30pm I sat down for a smoke. I took 3 drags and felt sick! I said “I can’t believe I used to do this. It’s so gross!”

Then of course over Sunday I finished the pack by 2pm. They’re expensive!!!! I live in Australia $38 for 30 smokes. 

So Monday aka today, had none, felt good, weird but good. 

Stupidly brought a packet of 20’s tried one at 10am and got the head rush, spinning, thought I was going to throw up. 

And yet, here it is 2.5hrs later and I’m about to have one. 

WTF? WTF IS WRONG WITH ME?!? 

Please help me or just rage at me about how stupid I’m being. 

I’m not having physical cravings, I don’t have to continue this routine. 

I’m lost. Quitting has been on my to do list for 3 years with varying success. 

Thanks for reading.

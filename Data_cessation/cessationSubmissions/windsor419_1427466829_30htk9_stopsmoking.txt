Is anyone else annoyed by people who vape saying they quit smoking

I get it, its better than smoking, but its taking the easy way out.  You are still a slave to the nicotine.  You have not quit anything, just the nicotine delivery system.

Theres seems to be a big circlejerk with vaping on reddit.  They all come to its defense.

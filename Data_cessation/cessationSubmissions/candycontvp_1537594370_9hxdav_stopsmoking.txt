Huge emotional blow and want to smoke

Hey guys, 

Hope your day has gone better than mine. 

Well... today I found out some pretty nasty shit, I'm super angry, I feel betrayed, fooled, stabed in the back. Someone very close to me has take a huge blow against me. I just want to vent so I'll say it. My dad did pretty good himself, he was murder four years ago in a kidnaping attempt, one of my uncles found out I had some money in the bank and asked for it, which was close to 20 thousand dollars. He asked for the money barely a week after my dad died, I was still mourning and recked. He said he was in a pickle and that he would be paying me interests monthly until he could pay the whole sum back.

When I agreed I though I had my inheritance money to fall back on, which was invested in my dad's investments. After a year of trying to find the money and his investments, I found out my uncle STOLE THAT FROM ME!! I was left penniless and heartbroken, I got my left back up again after suffering a mental breakdown as a result of my world crashing down in nearly everyway, and survived with the money my uncle was giving me  every month (which was mine, the interests) and a lame job I got. 

He apoligized for stealing everything and swore he would make it up to me. I had nothing left to do but trust. 

Well... today the dick tells me that he's not giving me a cent more, NO MORE INTERESTS AND HE'S NOT PAYING ME BACK THE MONEY THAT I LENT HIM or the money from my inheritance (note: the interests werent that much, a few hundred dollars a month, I agreed to this because I thought I had my inheritance money). I quit my job eight months ago!!!! I'm living off small freelance gigs I get. 

I'm fucking furious!!! i want a cigarette sooooo fucking bad, I know smoking won't fix my life, but I just want to get mind off this. 

I'm so angry, betrayed, scared. All these emotions I use to deal with cigarettes. I don't know how to deal with this level of stress without cigarettes.

Resetting my flair and starting again for hopefully the last time

I picked up smoking again around this time last year, after over 550 days clean.

What started as social smoking with my mother while I was home for Christmas last year slowly descended into me being a regular smoker. 

A year later, a new apartment and headed on a trip to London, I've decided to take the time traveling to get over the major first week hump and commit myself to quitting. Again.

I'm feeling super disappointed that I started up after almost 2 years free, and even more so that I let myself be a smoker for a year before getting back to quitting. I'm feeling scared (I actually feel fear in my body when I think about never having another cigarette), but I've done it before and I know that I can do it again. 

I've also learned that social smoking is really just a lie I tell myself - being a non-smoker means being a non-smoker. 

Wish me luck! Thanks so much to everyone at this sub for helping keep me accountable :)

I screwed up, gotta get back on track

So when I saw my 100+ day flair on this subreddit, I got really disappointed in myself because that was no longer the case. 

I had a nasty breakup over the weekend. I was in a bad mood and it gave me the urge to smoke again to get over what just happened, despite not having that urge for more than 100 days. I've done it twice since then, and I'm really mad at myself. We're all gonna have ups and downs during our lives, but I can't let that fact get between me and quitting smoking for good. Anyway, apologies for the rant. I hope my determination to keep going in this process will help everyone else doing the same thing!

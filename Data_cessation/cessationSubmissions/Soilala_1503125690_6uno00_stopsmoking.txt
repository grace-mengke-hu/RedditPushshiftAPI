Alcohol is a slippery slope to me.

I have stopped counting how many days since I stopped smoking, I guess I'm around 5 months. I consider myself ''healed'', since I no longer get cravings, and the smell is now gross to me. 

Except when I drink, I have no idea why, I want ''just one'' smoke, I know I can ask for one and I'll get it if I want it, just one won't hurt. Then I notice the thought pattern trying to justify smoking, and I manage to stop myself. I'm considering never drinking again, if that's what it takes. I'm growing tired of feeling obligated to consume drugs when hanging out with people.

The first week!

A first steppingstone :D 
Had a bit craving and my sleep is not very deep anymore, digestion problems and the slight feeling that something of with my perception.
The first three days where pretty hard.

So far it went as expected, isnt the first time i made it this far. Now comes the hard part where notsmokeing is the best thing i ever did for 99% of the time and 1% of horrible cravings and my brain making the weirdest excuses to make me light up one.

Wish me strength for the next week :)

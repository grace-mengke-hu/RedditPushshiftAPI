Does anyone else hate their favorite activities now ?

34 days smoke free. 

I used to love driving. I used to love hiking. I used to love sitting outside reading books. Now that I can't smoke while I drive/hike/read, I don't really enjoy doing those activities. So did I only enjoy them because I could smoke at the same time? 

Another thing is, I always used to reward myself with cigarettes. Clean for an hour, I get to smoke. Do the dishes, I get to smoke. Now I have no motivation to do things because I have no reward after. 

Has this happened to anyone else?

Edit: I'm not quitting by 'choice,' I quit for my boyfriend.

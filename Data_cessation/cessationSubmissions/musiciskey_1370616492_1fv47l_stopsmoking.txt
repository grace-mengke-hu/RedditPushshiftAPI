Ugh, this is annoying. Mood fluctuates all over the place!

Haven't smoked since sunday. I feel it's personal now. Me against my addiction. Some days were easy, others not so much. The moments of stress don't seem to bother me, it's the moments of relaxation that are driving me crazy! Having coffee? No cigarette for me! Driving somewhere? No cigarette for me! Time to bite through another cinnamon toothpick and just keep on truckin.

Initially I didn't really do this for me. I did it for my girlfriend and for my wallet. Is it wrong to still like smoking sometimes? Not all of the time, just sometimes. I tell myself that I never really liked it in the first place.

It's all one big headgame at this point now and I want to win it!

I quit an 18 year every day weed smoking habit, so I think I can take on the nicotine monster!

Just needed to vent somethoughts. Thanks for being here guys!

41 days free from nicotine

I did it with help from champix...craving is under control but I feel tired all the time ...Im all day on bed ... I stopped champix five days to see if it was the reason of my fatigue but it wasn't ...without champix I felt tired too plus craving hit me hard ...dose fatigue and feeling tired last for months ?

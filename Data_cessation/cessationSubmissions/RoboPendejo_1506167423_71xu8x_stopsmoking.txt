Here we go... day one I guess.

Hi folks, please ignore me, I'm just putting this out there for my own benefit.

I've been a smoker, on and off, for 34 years.  I developed cluster headaches a few years back, but that didn't stop me from smoking, and didn't stop me from drinking when I wasn't having an active period.  I quit drinking over a month ago when this current CH session got started, and although it seems to be helping a bunch when it comes to the headaches ramping up to a full '10' on the suicide-scale, I get minor-to-moderate headaches still.  Which is weird because before now my headache periods lasted less than a month but go figure.

Anyway, I had switched from cigarettes to vaping to lozenges and back, back and forth, on and off (my willpower is already sh*t) for a long time now.  It might be my mind playing tricks on me, but it sure seems like the introduction of nicotine, no matter how I take it, makes a minor headache get stronger.  Vape, smoke, lozenge, it doesn't matter.  If I'm having a minor nerve tweak going on it'll turn it into a headache, and if I'm having a headache it'll turn it into a worse one.

So I'm done.  I'll be chowing down on cold turkey from about 10 minutes from now on out (going to have a last, goodbye cigarette, and I'll be seeing you guys around!

TL/DR: Some dude's random rant, please ignore.

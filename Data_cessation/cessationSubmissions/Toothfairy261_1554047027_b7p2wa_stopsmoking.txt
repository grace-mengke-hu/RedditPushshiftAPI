It's taking every ounce of effort I have not to smoke.

My aunt passed away yesterday after a 2.5 year battle with cancer. She fought so long and so hard, and just couldnt hold on anymore. It's been 25 days since I quit smoking, and I want so badly just to sit down with a pack of cigarettes and cry my eyes out. So far, I havent...and I really dont plan on it because I know it wont help...but this is killing me.

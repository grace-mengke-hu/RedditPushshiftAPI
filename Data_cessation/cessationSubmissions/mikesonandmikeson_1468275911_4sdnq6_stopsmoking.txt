I realize i love smoking

If it wasn't for the countless diseases, stank ass breathe, and causing me to be extremely unfit (even though im a healthy body weight) i would have no desire to quit. 

Everything about smoking is awesome. It looks cool(fuck who says otherwise) it's a great way to start a conversation, nice way to pass the time, the head rush feels awesome, and it gives u the badboy persona thats so easily obtainable with a stick of rolled up leaves. 

Honestly if it wasnt disastrous to your health everybody would do it. Just like they did in the 40s. 1/2 people in america smoked during the 30-40s. That says something about how awesome smoking really is.

I am on my way to quitting because i want to live a long and healthy life and i miss being able to perform very well in sports. But i must say that i am gona miss it and i think its justified.

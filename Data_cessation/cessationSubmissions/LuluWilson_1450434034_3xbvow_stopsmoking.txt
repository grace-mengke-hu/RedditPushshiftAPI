I was at 2000+ days

Then I had a bad day. I mean, a very bad day, but not worse than many others I've had in the last 5-6 years. Only difference is I asked someone for a cigarette, and they gave it to me. 

One cigarette may be enough. Once you realize you can smoke a cigarette and then go a week without it, you'll smoke another one. You'll feel pretty confident you can go on smoking a cigarette every now and then, and before you can realize it you'll be smoking again.

I've been now smoking for a bit; about two months. I've started asking for cigs, then I bought them - I started with one a day, and ended with five/six. I used to be a very heavy smoker, so I know for sure I wouldn't have stopped there. The incredibly sad thing is I was so ashamed of myself I hid it from my family and friends. So I kept the cigarettes in a secret place, I bought a lot of chewing-gum, I washed my hands when I got back home. Just like when I was fourteen, but a lot worse, in terms of how I feel about myself.

So I quit yesterday :) and reset my badge. Today is my second day. Since I haven't told anyone, I am pretty much alone in this. I need a hug and I hug everyone back. We can do this!

edit: I wish to thank everyone for the support, you don't know how much that means to me. I am glad this sub exists. Thank you!

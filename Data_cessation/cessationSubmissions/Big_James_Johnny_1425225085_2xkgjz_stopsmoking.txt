2 months in and caved last night.

Today would have been 2 months smoke-free, had I not caved last night. Not only did I smoke a cigarette, I smoked two. I was on such a roll, but now I'm just really disappointed in myself. I've had a stressful week and maybe had a few too many drinks at the bar. I know I'm not going back to smoking, but I'm feeling down about smoking last night and feel that I've ruined my progress.

Phantosmia is weird! I experienced one Saturday night.

For the record, right now I am 15 days quit. Saturday night I was sitting in my office at work doing paperwork, and suddenly it smelled like someone just smoked a pack right there.  

This is a small office of a city government facility, and to my knowledge no one has ever smoked in the building. The windows are never open. The door was shut.  I had the computer and the desk fan on. It smelled like someone was behind the fan blowing smoke through. 

Of course there was no smoking. It was an olfactory hallucination triggered by my mind. It was freaky.  Has anyone else ever experienced one of these?

I’m killing myself.

I’m not suicidal, sorry. Its just that I realized this week that I’m showing signs of peripheral artery disease. I mean I’m a nurse and I know how bad smoking and nicotine is to the cells in my arterial walls. But I’ve told myself those things don’t happen until I’m older. Well, I’m 28 and this is happening. By choosing to smoke I’m killing myself. I’ve always “known” this. But it never hit me until now. Out of sight out of mind.

What’s crazy is that I’ve had residents in nursing homes who are starved for oxygen because of smoking and subsequent COPD. Most of the residents in the special care unit don’t have an official Alzheimer’s diagnosis rather they have vascular dementia and when looking at their chart- you guessed it- smokers. Just last month a coworkers son who is my age suffered a hemorrhagic stroke and his life is forever changed- he smoked. I give more breathing treatments than take shits in a given week. But until my body said, “hey dude you’re fucking me up.” I just ignored it.

Sorry for the rant but I just needed to share. I’ve set my end date for 2 days from now and will be hanging around here for awhile. May we all die from a freak skydiving accident when we’re 85.

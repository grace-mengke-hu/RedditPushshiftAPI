Strange Dreams and I Keep waking up!

Is this normal during the quitting process? Ive been slowly tapering down and have been successful in not having a cigarette for a day or two. I understand that I am dropping the nicotine levels in my body, but is it normal to continue to have strange dreams and waking up hourly in the quitting process? I used to sleep well and through the night but now I am waking up constantly. It's the worst part of this process for me and it's making me dread going to bed lately. Is this normal and what can I do?

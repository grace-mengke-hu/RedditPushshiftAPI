One more time....

Been smoking a pack a day for about 12 years. I've "quit" before, made it about a week a couple times. Trying again for the nth time starting now (last cigarette was last night almost exactly 24 hours ago). Some possible issues with family members kinda highlighted the need for me again, plus my desire to start taking better care of myself. So this is my shameless plug for the "good luck" posts. Don't have many people I actually talk to that show their support. Everyone at my work smokes, pretty sure that's going to be the hardest part, besides the fact there's nothing to do around here. Great to see everyone's stories so far, good inspiration and I hope I can stick it out this time. Already feel like I'm going to explode, but I know it'll pass from past attempts. Thanks for putting your stories down, and good luck to everyone to keep with it.

A question for those of you who are no longer smoking cigarettes but smoke pot...

I've been off the cancer sticks for three solid days now after almost two years of heavy smoking, but I still love smoking my pot. I used to thoroughly enjoy my spliffs, but am now wondering if it's kosher? 

Essentially, I'm wondering if you consider the combination of tobacco/weed to count as a cigarette or if I should just stick to the green.

Going out and drinking.. HOW?

Hey guys,

Im a little drunk at the moment so forgive my spelling.

I am 19 years old and i have been smoking 3/4 pack a day for about 3 years now, not that much since i was 16 year old. So only 3 years, but i want to quit. Sometimes smoking cause me to get anxiety about my health, and cause me to hyperventilate. 

I go out every saturday, and all my friends smoke, literally everyone that i go out with. We sit at someones house we drink, then we go out. While at drinking everybody starts smoking around me, and i dont want to be captain buzzkill to say go smoke somwhere else, but i dont want to lock myself in my house that i cant go out. 

I started stopping smoking at monday night, i smoked a couple hours ago my first cigarette. I didnt really have trouble stopping smoking, i actually loved it and wasnt hard at all. I didnt feel really bad that i smoked because i knew it would happen. And when im drunk its really impossible to stop smoking, i know some of you can relate.

But how do you guys do it? That go clubbing and drinking and stuff. I would love some advice.

Thank   you!!

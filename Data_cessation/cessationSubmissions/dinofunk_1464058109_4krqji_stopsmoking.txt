Sick as a dog, but there's a bright side

Caught some kind of cold over the weekend, feeling pretty miserable. BUT, I'm recovering so much faster, and that's just with having quit a couple months ago. 3 months ago I'd take a week or more to turn the corner, but today I think I've turned it after day 3.

Sick and Sad Again

I've wanted to quit for close to a year now, and I've tried, but so much has happened to stress me out in my life that I just couldn't stick to it. I am currently dealing with bronchitis for the fourth time since January. My chest hurts every day. I cough mucous every few minutes. I feel disgusting. 

This is my life. It doesn't get any better than this. :/

I started going to the gym again on Friday. I started eating less a few weeks ago. I started losing weight and not feeling like a piece of shit all the time. I think it's natural to want to breathe again without wheezing. 

This is going to suck worse than anything has ever sucked before, but if I don't do this now, I will surely die young.

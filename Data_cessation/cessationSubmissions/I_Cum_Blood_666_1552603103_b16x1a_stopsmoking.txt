Day 2

I’m at 1 day and 16 hours now. I had a hard time falling asleep last night. The cravings today have been just as strong, but I guess less frequent and shorter lasting. My brain has been really foggy. I can’t concentrate well and I have low motivation for everything. I hope tomorrow is better.

I've had 4 beers at a BBQ on a saturday afternoon, I'm on day 13 and I did NOT have a cigarette.

Day 13 of no cigarettes and I passed a HUGE hurdle. Haven't drunk more than 1 beer in a day since quitting and today was perfect fertile ground for breaking my quit. Sunny saturday afternoon, BBQ, 4 ice cold beers. 

But I did not smoke. I'm home now and I am getting ready for bed. Very satisfied.

What really helped is another guy was there - he was on day 24 of his quit. We were supporting each other, saying how well we were doing. It felt like he was this sub-reddit, helping me through this test.

Have to say: had there been another smoker at the BBQ, both of us would have crumbled. But that is a challenge (and a post) for another day down the line. I'm just happy I crushed this 4 beers at a sunny BBQ test!

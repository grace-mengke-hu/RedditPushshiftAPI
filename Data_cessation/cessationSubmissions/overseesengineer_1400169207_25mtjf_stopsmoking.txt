Smoked my last one

I just stubbed my last cigarette. Threw lighters, smoke packs and ashtrays in the trash. Please help my survive the withdrawal. How did you do it? 

Edit: The moments where I felt most entitled to cigarettes are:

1- on an empty stomach first thing when I wake up, so it hits the dome straight away. But instead of feeling relieved or good I become grumpy and wish I hadn't

2- After a meeting when I want to get out of the stuffy meeting room feeling and smell some air outside. But it's just an excuse to de-load. It never really relieved the tension, instead it made me stress out about work I'm missing while having a cigarette outside. I will try and walk around the building if the weather permits. 

3- After having a big meal. That also doesn't work and I usually say will maybe the second one will do the trick, and it doesn't. I'm in the process of losing weight so I will avoid big fatty meals.

4- When I'm bored watching TV shows or a movie. A cigarette never relieves boredom. I'll take a walk, go up and down the stair case. This is probably where I will need strong will.

I'm sure I have other triggers but I can't quite put my finger on them.

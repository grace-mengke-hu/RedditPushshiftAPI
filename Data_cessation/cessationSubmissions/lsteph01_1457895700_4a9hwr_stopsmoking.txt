I stumbled :-(

Hit an unexpected trigger, old friend just  dropped by last night out of nowhere, was really cool catching up but he has a heavy smoking habit. 

Would have been a week smoke free today, but i will keep myself accountable and restart the clock. Getting through that week proved I Can do this, I just have to be more mindful of my triggers. Keep striving guys!

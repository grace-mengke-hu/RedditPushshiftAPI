1 month free today

Im really chuffed and pleased to share on here!!

I never would have thought id make it when i was on my first week and had a near miss at 2 weeks.

Thanks to you all I managed to stay smoke free.

In terms of motivation I find monigoring my health inprovements on a non smoking app really encouraging - it seems like 2 more months until my gum texture and circulation are improved.

I'm running 3 times a week, training for a big mountain climbinh challenge to keep me focused on a physical goal which would be hindered if I start smoking again.  Esp in terms of circulation - my goals require that to keep improving.

I have saved over Â£200 with which ill buy some running spikes, a new pair of comfortable shoes and get my hair coloured.  One everyday need one related to my new fitness goal and one to help me feel better about my non smoking self!!

Look forward to sharing my progress in future with you all :)

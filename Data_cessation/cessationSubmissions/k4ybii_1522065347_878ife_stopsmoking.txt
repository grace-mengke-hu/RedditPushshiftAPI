Greetings :-)

Hello everyone!

So I joined the stopsmoking army 33 hours ago and now I want to write something in this subreddit to distract me a bit.

I'm 24 years old and I smoked for 8 years. I know that other people have spent many more years of their lives smoking and that I am still relatively young, but I just thought it would be a good idea in the long run.

But here comes my problem...

I start thinking about my current life situation and it feels like I have to smoke to get through it.

I'm under a lot of pressure because I work during the day and in the evening I go to an evening high school to make up my graduation.

All my friends and classmates are smokers.
I have to learn so much and I just don't know...
It feels like my brain is looking for excuses to start smoking again.
Or is it realy the wrong time to stop? I mean... Should I wait until my graduation next year?

I am a nervous and stressed person and I just have the feeling after my first ridiculous 33 hours that I won't make it or that it will affect my good grades...

What should I do..?

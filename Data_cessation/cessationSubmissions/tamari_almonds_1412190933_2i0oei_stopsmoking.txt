Starting now

Oct 1, 2014. Just put out my last smoke. Logged the time in a quit smoking app. Badge requested. 

Evenings aren't a problem for me to go without smoking, the tough part will be tomorrow morning. Think if I can make it past the morning I'll be ok. Any advice on dealing with the first morning without a smoke? I really need to do this and make it stick this time. Thanks!

4 months and 26 days - Still staying strong but loss &amp; grief are rough. Mam, this post is a bummer to write.

My grandad is nearing the end of his life. I donâ€™t want to smoke but at the same time I do.  

Has anyone stayed quit through the loss of a loved one? What helped? 

Thanks in advance.

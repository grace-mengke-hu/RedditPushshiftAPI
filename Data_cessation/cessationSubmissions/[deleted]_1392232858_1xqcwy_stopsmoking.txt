I need to quit. Now.

I'm 28 years old. I've been smoking for 13 years. I'm tired of the way I smell and I'm REALLY tired of being dependent. I *need* to quit. My son BEGS me to quit at least once a week. I need some advice on the best way to quit. I quit cold turkey for 10 months (pregnancy). I smoke almost a pack a day now. I tried the patches and they took the edge off...for about 2 hours and then it was back full force. What kind of symptoms can I experience with quitting? Advice is totally welcome here!

I am quitting right now.

Was diagnosed with hypertension at 21. Kept smoking despite. Just had a panic attack induced by a cig - luckily I have medicine. 

Smoking (and drinking and drugs - which I've quit - only drinking rarely) has destroyed my young body. 

I quit right now. I've thrown away my dip and crushed my cigarettes. It will be rough, but I shouldn't feel this way this young.

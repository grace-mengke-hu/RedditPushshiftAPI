QUIT NOW

I got a call from my clinic last night. They said my pulmonary function test results show signs of AIR TRAPPING -- severe asthma, and LIKELY COPD/EMPHYSEMA.

I'm 21. I've been smoking for only 5 years, 10-15 a day.

You're not invincible. Even if you're young, quit now! I'm 21 and I have an "old person's disease!"

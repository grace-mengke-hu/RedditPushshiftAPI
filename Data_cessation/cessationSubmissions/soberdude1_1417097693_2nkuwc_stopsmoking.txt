Celebrating more than Thanksgiving today!!!

Thanks to Mr. Allen Carr and his amazing book, I can be grateful today. Celebrating 2 years totally cigarette and nicotine free today!!! After 40 years of a pack and a half a day habit, today I'm free! No gum, no patches, no pretend cigarettes. After learning the truth and having a new mind set about quitting, I'm free. 

Inhaling nicotine, ingesting nicotine, absorbing nicotine is not beating a craving. Putting nicotine in my body is feeding that craving. If I want cravings to stop, I must eliminate nicotine. 

Quitting is only as hard as we tell ourselves it's going to be. Or as hard as some one else said it was. After learning the truth, it was EASY to just say, ENOUGH! 

I smoked nearly a half a million cigarettes in my life. I tried every possible way to quit. Failed them all. With the right information, it was easy to quit this time. Stay strong my fellow quitters. Quitting is very possible.

Severe symptoms?

Hi everybody, I feel like my symptoms have been worse than what I’ve read and for too longer. I’m so tired that I don’t want to do anything at all and I have body pain (Head, neck, stomach) and severe anxiety. Anyone else feel like shit for a while after quitting? I quit -2 days ago but relapsed for 2 days and quit again last night. So over it!!

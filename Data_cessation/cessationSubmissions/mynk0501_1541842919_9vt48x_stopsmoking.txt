10 days ..yippeeee !!!

I was 20 a day smoker for most part of the last year..tried to 'quit' every day since last few months and failed...was shit scared before this quit..Quit Cold Turkey on 31st October 2018 at around 1500 hrs IST..... it has been easy this time. No physical symptoms. Only some strong psychological cravings, entirely manageable.

Can you get tongue cancer from just one year of smoking?

I've quit two weeks back and since then have been looking after my teeth.

In doing so, I noticed a white patch on the side of my tongue, and I'm freaked out that it's something serious from smoking.

How plausible is this since I've only smoked on and off for a year. 

Thanks guys!

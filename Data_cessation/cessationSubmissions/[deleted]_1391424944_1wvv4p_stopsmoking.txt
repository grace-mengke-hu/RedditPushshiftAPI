I don't really know what to do...

Today was almost a full two days without a cigarette (I know big whoop) and I was feeling good. That was until all my friends and I went out to the bar after the superbowl and I felt the need to go out and smoke with them. I didn't because I was with my gf who is dead-set on me quitting, but when we got home I cracked and went out to smoke with a roommate and she freaked out. I told her that I finally realized quitting for her or any other external reason would not be the answer, I need to want it myself. The thing is I really do want to quit but the constant outside pressure to stop makes me want to smoke all the more just to show defiance or independence and I'm sick of it. I am tired of disappointing myself, her and others around me when I make empty promises of quitting. 
I just wanted to ask have any of you felt a stronger urge to smoke when there is strong pressure to quit, even from your loved ones?
I'm sorry if this is not the right forum for this but I'm at my wits end here

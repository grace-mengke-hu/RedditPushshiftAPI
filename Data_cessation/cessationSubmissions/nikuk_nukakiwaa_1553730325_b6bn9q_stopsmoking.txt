2 days - craving, but not for nicotine - need something in lungs!

Does anyone experience this? I'm not craving nicotine (I'm doing replacement) - I don't have any irritability or anxiety, which is my usual presentation. I'm just very restless because my lungs feel *empty!* It feels as though they *need* smoke in them for some reason, and of course I'm not going to provide that.

Might steam work? I'd love to hear any alternatives!

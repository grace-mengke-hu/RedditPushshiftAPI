I don't know how long it's been since my last cigarette, but I feel good.

I've tried to quit a few times, even got as far as 4-5 months without smoking and then picking it up again.  I don't know how long it's been since my last cigarette.  

Most people mark the day they quit and make a big deal out of it and celebrate.  That's all good and well if that works for you and I'm not knocking that.  But I did it differently this time.  I didn't mark the date, I don't know exactly when it was I had my last cigarette, but the best I can estimate it's been about 4 months.  I also didn't tell anyone, I just did it.  No one wants to hear about my attempt to quit smoking again...my non smoker friends have heard it all before, my smoking friends don't want to hear it because they don't want to quit.  

I feel like this is working for me because the other times I was always like "WOW! It's been X weeks, and I haven't smoked, I deserve one, I can have just one."  But, that "just one" always leads to another.  Now, since I don't know how long it's been, I don't get those thoughts, and I don't even crave them.

This is the first mention I've made of quitting to anyone and I feel better than I have since I started smoking.  I can breathe better, I'm not coughing all day, my voice is recovering and sounding better.

Just thought I'd throw this out there for anyone else who might be struggling to quit.

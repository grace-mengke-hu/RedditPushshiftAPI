1000hrs free!

Well it has been long over a month now.
Not a single puff. I have dreamed about me smoking, didn't feel great. Felt like betrayal.
First two weeks were hard. Especially the first days.
At about 2 weeks I started to feel the benefits. I could breathe better, sleep better. Coughs are still there but much less.
The Smoke Free app was great. Shows progress. 
For the guys out there: the sex is so-so much better. I feel like a unicorn.

Also my gf had been really supportive about this. And yes, she's the reason I quit. Or to paraphrase - gave me enough motivation and strength to quit. 
I feel proud and so does she.

Make yourself proud! Feel the energy and air!

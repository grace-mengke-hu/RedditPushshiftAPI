I had a dream...

...one of my friends was having a car wash on his front lawn...which is strange oddly enough. We start talking and I pull out a cigarette and take a few puffs. Then I realized what I was doing, threw it out, and threw out the whole pack. If I can do this in my dreams, I might as well do it in real life. This might be my only dream come true.

Smoked "socially" for the past 3 years, want to quit entirely. Worried I've still fucked myself long term because of my college habits.

Hello all,

So, I recently graduated from undergrad. from sophomore through senior year, I'd call myself a social smoker. I've only gone through maybe... 5 or 6 packs of cigarettes in my lifetime (with some other tobacco use mixed in). 

I know being a social smoker is still dangerous, and I've greatly increased my risk of heart disease, stroke, lung cancer, etc. I'm just wondering if now, as a 22-year-old in-shape male, I've permanently fucked myself over. I know the risk of heart disease and stroke will go away quickly, and I do exercise nearly every day so those two will be further mitigated... but this fear of lung cancer won't leave my mind. 

If I've only been smoking in a social setting for 3 years, have I permanently increased my risk of death? Specifically in lung cancer? I really can't find much research or information on this so any input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks all.

Those who are using or have used an ecig

I quit almost three weeks ago and the ecig really helped me. I started with 9mg to 6mg now I’m down to 3mg. I eventually want to stop using the ecig but don’t know the easiest way to do it. How long did you use the ecig for? Are you still using it? How did you manage to quit? Thank you for any tips and information, really appreciate it.

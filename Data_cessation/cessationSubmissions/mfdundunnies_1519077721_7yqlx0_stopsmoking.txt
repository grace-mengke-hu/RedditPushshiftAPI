Whats the consensus on here about hypnotism?

sorry this has probably been asked a number of times- I'm assuming that itll prob be 50-50 people saying it either helped or did nothing

do you thinking having a cynical and skeptical attitude going into it guarentees it wont work?

and any negatives to it other than it not working and wasting a couple hundred bucks?

thanks

Set tomorrow as my quit date. Nervous...

So I have smoked full time for about three years. I'm 21. It started socially, one here and there at a party. I'd buy a pack and it would last weeks! But gradually, as we all know, I started smoking on my own...and its all downhill from there. I smoke probably between 5 and 25 a day depending on circumstances, usually I'd say around 10-15 generally.

I downloaded the Stop Smoking App with my quit date, and have completed the 'missions' it gave me such as buying a packet of cigarettes you don't like to put you off until your date (helped me cut down immensely) and writing a list of reasons to stop. I know I really really want to, I'm disgusted in myself for even starting and if I could punch my 18 year old self in the face I would! 

But I'm nervous. I'm usually quite a motivated person. I haven't personally (and I could be wrong) felt a strong...bodily? I guess connection to smoking. I don't get many physical feelings towards it when I want/need one, I just do I think because, well, I smoke. It feels like its just a reflex kind of situation. Its what I do. 10 minute work break? Cigarette. Wake up in the morning? Cigarette. But of course, I'm probably deluded on how much my body actually has come to depend on it in the last few years.

I know I haven't been smoking long, so I'm hoping it won't be too difficult to stop! I really admire the posts I've been reading on here of you guys who have managed to stop after years and years. Any advice for a 21 year old girl on her first quit attempt? How can I make this my first and only?

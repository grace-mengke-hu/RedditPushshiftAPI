Today is the day...

It's Friday, August 24th., 2018... It's 01:00 hrs, and I just smoked my last cigarette... Been smoking for some 29 years, give or take... Anything between 10 and 20 a day... But no more... I am ready, not to give up smoking, but to live a life as a non - smoker... Can't wait to see the results on my VO2 max... Can't wait to get my sense of smell back... My sense of taste... Yet I'm worried... It's been an awful big part of my life. I want it so bad... For me... My kid... I'm gonna be strong... And I'm gonna love it üòé Greetings to all of you... Non-smokers and soon to be non-smokers alike ‚ù§Ô∏è

Trying hard not to judge.

Even though it's 102 I decided to take a wander by the local smoke shack.  It's been about 6 months since I went out there (I didn't want to go back to the smoke shack even during my relapse).

I was a little shocked that nobody batted a fucking eye when the girl on her second cigarette shared that she found out the sex of her unborn child.

All I could think about was "that kid is going to have to go through what I'm going through right now".

I'm trying hard not to judge.  I don't think I'll wander out there again.

Second Full Day.

Won't lie, even with the e-cig it's a struggle. Only this time I'm recognising the excuses for smoking that I'm telling myself for what they are; the death throes of a demon. I want to thank all of you for your stories, and the descriptions you give of your struggles and triumphs. This subreddit has become a place of solace for me, a place where I can remember why I'm fighting, and where I can see I'm not the only one. I fully intend to stop using the e-cig over time, purposefully not using it around the times where I would have smoked a cigarette in order to break the routine I fell into. Good luck to all of you, I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that both I, and you can get through this fight as healthier, happier human beings.

Day 2 - 3 tips?

I've been cutting back lately. Went from 10 a day to around 3. Pretty good accomplishment. Yesterday I made it til 2pm without really wanting a cigarette. I've been pushing myself not to light one up since. Its not always easy though. I have some of those nicorette mini lozenges. I figure if one of those will take the edge off enough to not light a cigarette I'll take it. I've had two today so far.

I want to keep this whole not smoking thing going. Any tips for those first couple days?

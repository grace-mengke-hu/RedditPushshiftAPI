Just smoked my last cigarette. Went and bought my e-cig today. Here we go. Day 1.

After many failures in the past, I'm doing it right this time. Got myself an ecig today, and decided to buy a pack of a cigarette brand I *hate*, then force myself to smoke the whole thing. I feel like shit right now, and don't want to ever smoke another cigarette. This ecig will help, too.

I'm serious this time. I want my life to last, not end in ten years. I'm done. After nearly a decade of smoking (8 years), I'm done.

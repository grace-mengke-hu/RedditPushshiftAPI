Quitting is easier the second time

Been a smoker for about 7 years now, I managed to quit back in February and held for 4 months. I was travelling with my dad for three weeks so that got me started more easily (I don't like smoking in his presence and after a week without any I figured I'll do the whole trip). Comes May, I drank a bottle of red wine at a party at my place and bum two cigarettes. I figured I'm a champ I can have some once in a while, which of course escalated in about 10 days to full fledged smoker again, about a pack a day.

Past Friday, evening comes and I realize I didn't smoke since the morning and tell myself I'll hold for three days and see from there (as I told myself a billion times without success before that). For some reason I'm able to and my mindset really switched back to "fuck cigarettes" about 24h later. I've been having some cravings but somehow nothing overwhelming, it's barely hard actually I'm back to my Spring mindset where I realized how much it sucks (took me two or three weeks back then) and how I prefer not smoking. 

I think I will be able to stay clean again. This time I have one more tool in that I know I CAN'T have "one cigarette", ain't no such thing for me as soon as I get nicotine it overrides my brain. I also know I CAN and PREFER being a non-smoker, fucking loved it in Spring/early Summer. Felt so proud about myself.

My main motivator is frankly the smell I don't wear anymore, feeling much more attractive. I'll go get my teeth so rewhithened to keep the temptation away. The money, goddamn cigarettes are expensive. 

Still have to get the rest of my life in order, gotta start eating properly and exercising, I'm a "naturally fit" 23m but I slacked so much in the last years I think I have a poor health. Not smoking should help!

Stay strong y'all, it's all about the mindset and the first few days. Looking forward to my three weeks, if my history holds by then I will have 0 desire to relapse.

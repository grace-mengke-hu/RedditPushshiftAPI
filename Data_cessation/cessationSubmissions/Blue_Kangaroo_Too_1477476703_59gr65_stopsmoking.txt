My chest hurts!

Background: I quit end of February using a dry herb vapouriser (weed really helped me with the withdrawal) and then tapered down to complete sobriety. I've never much liked tobacco but mixed it with weed for about 15 years. About 7 (filterless) spliffs a day.  One month ago I started smoking spliffs again. What an idiot! I've gone cold-turkey this time - no tobacco, no weed. Withdrawal is appalling- insomnia, night sweats (and day sweats), irritable, crying half the time for no reason. 

I'm on day 6 of this quit. Just this last day or two I've found I'm really breathless, even when I'm sitting around. If I exert myself at all (even if it's just shouting at my kids to tidy their rooms) my chest feels like there's an elephant sitting on it. Not serious pain but not a good feeling either. And so breathless, I can't seem to get enough oxygen!
Is this normal? Is this part of the process - I don't remember feeling like this when I quit last time. Anyone out there have a clue?

On the plus side, I really don't want to smoke!

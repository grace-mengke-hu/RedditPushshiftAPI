I have quit smoking

I quit smoking on April 24 after being diagnosed with COPD. I had been weening myself down to about 3-5 cigarettes a day. I never thought I would be able to stop completely after 50 years of smoking. It has been easier than my expectations but this is the first time I've had the right mind set. I want to be around to enjoy my family and friends.

Did anyone else have vivid dreams?

I've been having trouble sleeping and when I do sleep I have these really vivid dreams. Unfortunately, they are all about my breakup that happened a few months ago which I was fine with before quitting smoking. 

Did anyone else experience this? Do you remember at what point the crazy dreams stopped?

Day 4 happiness

I am super super happy. Althoug I'm only on day 4 of being smoke free. I am still super chuffed. Every time I use to light a cigarette in the last two years I told myself how stupid  I was for smoking and all other bad, negative stuff about being a smoker at age 53. I didnt realize how much bad energey that brought into my personal space however it is very freeing not having to berate myself about smoking!  And I' only on day 4.....my happiness is going to soar by the time I get to Day 30!! lol...but maybe very true!

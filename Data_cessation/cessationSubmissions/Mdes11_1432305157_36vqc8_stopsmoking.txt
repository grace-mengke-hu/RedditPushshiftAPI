Just over a month now and my cravings are non stop. Any suggestions?

My cravings are driving me insane lately. My brain is starting to tell me, "Congrats you've gone over a month, you can reward yourself with a cigarette now." I'm staying strong for now but I'm afraid I'm going to cave. My partner and I have been under quite a bit of stress lately, and that makes the cravings so much worse. I've been reading the Allen Carr book you've all been talking about and it's helping a bit, but not enough. Any suggestions on how to help? (first time posting btw)

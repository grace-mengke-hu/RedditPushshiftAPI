I was trolled from cigs for the last time

Something went wrong on saturday and i binge smoked again until today. I realized that when that happens and i try to quit again neurotically always ending up buying them and smoking 3x thinking "this is the last one" and it gives me a deep depression. This time I'm going to stay quit. Cigs are shit anyway

I DID IT, 5 days feeling like im in the clear !

so last week around this time i had to go the E.R for a Spontaneous pneumothorax , a pocket of air outside of my lungs but in my chest was causing 40% of my left lung to be caved in . I had to have a tube inserted through my ribs and suck out the air, for two days i laid in the hospital in pain. anyways i made the choice that i don't need cigarettes anymore. i was going on two days with out one why not get over the three day hump. my first few days were easy as shit because of the morphine and Vicodins . but now im out and my lung is healing. haven't smoke a cig in 5 days and i dont even have the desire to anymore. my dad still smokes and i can smell it in the morning but it has no effect on me. the only time i really get a craving is after i eat food . but ill be strong !

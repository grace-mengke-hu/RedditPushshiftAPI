Day 1. What a choice I've made. (X-post from r/loseit)

Hi everyone.  It's about time I've made this decision.  I'm sorry if this is TMI or unrelated, but it's time for a HUGE lifestyle change, and I wanted to share with you guys as well. 



I'm a 25 year old male IT Specialist currently weighing in at 262 pounds.  A little bit about my day-to-day:

* I drink 1 big Monster Energy and 1 liter of Mountain Dew a day.  Sometimes 2 Monsters a day.
* I smoke 1 pack of cigarettes a day.  Have done so for four years. Ow. 
* I only ever eat maybe..*maybe*..once per day, and without snacking usually.  This "meal" would consist of two sausage biscuits from a local gas station.
* I've an umbilical hernia and a 5.6^o curve in my spine, which I've used as an excuse to not work out.


Those **were** my choices.  Not anymore.  

My choice now is to live healthy.  Eat healthy.  Be healthy.  I've had two cigarettes all day long (dropped the ball on that one), absolutely zero energy drinks or soda of any kind, and I have eaten a somewhat healthy lunch from Subway (I'm actually starting to meal prep tonight so I will have lunches to bring to work.)  I will do what I can in the gym this evening without risking further complications to my hernia or spine.

No more excuses, no more self pity.  It's time to get to work.

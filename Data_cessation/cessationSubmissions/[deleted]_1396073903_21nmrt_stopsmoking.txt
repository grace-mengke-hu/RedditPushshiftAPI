I slipped

I smoked. 26 days free and I decided to just try a cigarette (the fact that I was drinking didn't help).

This is bittersweet, however. For some reason, the cigarette tasted foul--almost as if its "true" taste was what I consumed. I feel as if when I used to smoke regularly cigarettes had a fairly neutral taste, but that cigarette tasted like how I remember them to taste when I had my first few cigarettes in history. Disgusting and I got that stinging in my lungs that was reminiscent of the very very early days of smoking. 

Yes, I slipped. Yes, I ruined my streak. But this is the most I've ever been turned off cigarettes. It's been hours since my slip-up and the thought of smoking is disgusting... again, it's like how a completely fresh smoker feels when they have their first few cigarettes. The experience isn't pleasant and there's no burning desire to smoke again. 

What does /r/stopsmoking have to say about my situation? How hard did I fuck up? Any insight? Sorry for the nature of my writing; I'm still fucking drunk and it took my 20 minutes to type this

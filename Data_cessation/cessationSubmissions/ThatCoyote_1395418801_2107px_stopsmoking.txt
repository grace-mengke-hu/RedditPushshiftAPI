50 days

Been 50 days since. I began cigar smoking back in October, but I realized in late January that a lot of my frustrations were being caused by nicotine withdraw. I immediately began the process of stopping. I resisted and resisted and told myself NO. Now I'm at 50 days!

Btw, I smoked Churchills. Those are pretty big.

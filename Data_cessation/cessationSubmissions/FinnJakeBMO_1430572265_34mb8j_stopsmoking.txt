Venting: day 1

I decided yesterday to quit smoking. I have been smoking for 8 years now, about a pack a day.  I have a daughter due this week and a son who is almost 2. I do not want them to remember me smoking and I want to be healthy, as a role model.

This will probably be something I either add to, or maybe do a post daily, idk. Are there any ways you have found that help ease urges? I have many triggers that I have to work through. 

I live a pretty stress free life at the moment, so I am hoping this is an ideal time for me to stop. 

Thank you for reading, and even if no one does, it's kind of therapeutic to just type. Have a good day! Stay strong!!

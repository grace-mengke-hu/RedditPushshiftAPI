2nd Time Around Gave Me Success In Quitting For Good

I have NOT smoked cigarettes in 3 years. After 56 years of smoking a pack a day, I wanted a change. 5 years ago I tried quitting with my son, and did "ok" for about a year. I tried many different flavors at 18mg nicotine, but something was missing. My son, on the other hand, loved his new life without cigarettes. After 1 year, I went back to smoking after really trying so hard not to. I was angry and disappointed in myself, and I felt I had let my son down too. 
About a year after going back to cigarettes, I was hanging out with my son and his friends when one of them told me about "Flavorless eJuice". I thought, why not since I have the equipment, so next day I bought a 30ml bottle of it.
THAT! my friends was the turning point for me. I have never looked back at those memories of smoking cigarettes. After my first tank of Flavorless 12mg nicotine, I didn't miss smoking at all.
My son and his friends like their various flavors, and that's fantastic. I'm very proud of them for taking that step to a healthier life. But, it was NOT for me. My 1st attempt at quitting was a failure, yet it was a first step. My 2nd time around gave me success in quitting for good, thanks to Flavorless eJuice.
It worked for me, and if you are battling the "nasty" habit, maybe, just maybe it will work for you.
After 3 years of not smoking, I still vape flavors now and then, but mostly I love my flavorless. I'm down to 6mg nic now.
I hope someone who really needs a boost to stop can have the same success I had.
Thanks for reading &amp; good luck.

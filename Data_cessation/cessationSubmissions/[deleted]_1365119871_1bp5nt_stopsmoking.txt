I'm done smoking! Best tips for an axious smoker, pro quitters?

I'm done, seriously. I mean, not only it tastes like crap and has negative influence on pretty much every single existing health condition, recently it made me feel like I was suffocating in the morning. Basically I wake up suffocating and it takes a while to catch my breath... It has been happening for about a week now and I must admit I'm actually affraid to go to sleep tonight, like having insomnia wasn't enough -.-

Anyway, my biggest issue with quitting is that, like most of you probably, I'm a very anxious person. It's been my coping method for so long... Every time I feel the least bit sad or nervous it's smoking time...

So yeah, I would greatly appreciate your tips. I just decided this and wrote the post to rant and look for advice. Thank you all.

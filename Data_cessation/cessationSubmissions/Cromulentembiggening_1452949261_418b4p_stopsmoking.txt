Just had a smoking "bender" after 9 years without a smoke.

Lurker, but never posted here. I'm feeling pretty shitty and nervous right now. After 9 years of not smoking, I just had a night of several smokes. I am on a guys weekend and here were a bunch of smokers - a situation that I have been in before and not smoked. I decided it had been long enough without me smoking and that I could have a few. I had a bunch (didn't really count). Now it's the next morning and I couldn't feel shittier. I'm really nervous about a full relapse (into my normal life). On the bright side, my normal life isn't really set up to accept smoking (would cause major problems with my support system). 

Any advice? Anyone been here and not become a smoker again. I'm really worried about this right now.

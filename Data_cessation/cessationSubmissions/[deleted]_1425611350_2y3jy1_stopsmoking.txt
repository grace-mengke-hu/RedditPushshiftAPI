I'm about to break...

My mum just tried to commit suicide, it's not the first time so excuse my callousness. One of my best friends emotionally abused me because I refused to return his feelings, now he won't stop texting me horrible things day after day. And my sister is in an abusive relationship, she came to my town today to escape her partner who has been treating her badly. I obsess about smoking, after all this time, because it would give me relief and I just don't care about myself anymore... at this point I feel like I'm going to break and hurt sonebody if I don't have a smoke... at leas the abusive bastards who have hurt my family. Please change my mind.

Fell off the wagon

Quit for 2 months. Fells off the wagon and started smoking heavily for another 2 months. I'm just upset that I could've been quit for 4 months now, but alas, I go again. Approaching my 4th day and it has been easier than my last attempt thus far. 

I also feel that the experience from quitting last time will be helpful for when I try to trick myself into having one cigarette "since i'm no longer addicted". 

Thank you everyone for keeping me motivated through your posts on this sub.

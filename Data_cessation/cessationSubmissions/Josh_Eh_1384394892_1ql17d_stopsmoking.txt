I'm 21, smoked for three years and quit today...how fucked am I?

I know that three years isn't a long time considering most people who are dying from cigarettes have smoked for decades. Don't get me wrong, I know that I've damaged myself in the past three years. I just want to know - relatively speaking - how much trouble I'm in. I know that nobody here can open my chest up and look at my lungs, but if I could just get a general guess?

Here are some facts about me and my smoking:
- Heaviest I ever smoked was a pack a day, this lasted from about January of this year to the summer of this year. Before that I would smoke anywhere from a few a day to half a pack. At least once a week I'd smoke an entire pack in one sitting because I'd be with my friends.
-I started running cross-country when I was 17 and still run to this day. I chose smoking over running so many times and dammit, this time I'm choosing my passion over my addiction.
-I know that there are mixed feelings over ecigs, but I spent $50 on a setup today to make quitting easier. I've also become addicted to caffeine. Not as a way to curb my cigarette problem, I'm just a college student who only sleeps 3-5 hours a night. Developed on its own.
-I've tried to quit smoking three times in my life. First time was last fall and it lasted until January when my girlfriend of a year broke up with me, this is when the pack a day started...smoking has also damaged my relationships and turned several girls away that were otherwise interested in me.

I had a routine checkup with my doctor about six months ago at the height of my smoking. He said that I checked out fine - no problems with my lungs or heart that he could see. He strongly suggested I quit and even offered me medicine that would help. I turned it down. My past self is always fucking things up for me.

I guess I should close this by saying the reason I decided to quit. I'd just finished smoking a pack along with a pint and some coffee within a few hours at a friend's place. I got home, got in bed, then I started sweating bullets. I was up for an hour because my heart felt like it was going to beat out of my chest. My own heartbeat kept me awake. This happened a week ago. Since then I've bought one pack and it took me until now to finish it. I went to work today with two left. Smoked one and gave the other to my coworker. I haven't smoked since 11am this morning.

So. Now that you know my story, any encouraging words would be much appreciated. I'm really hoping that I'm not going to have tar-coated lungs for the rest of my life. I've always wanted to run a marathon. I got close to it in high school before I started smoking, even trained for one during my senior year of high school and my freshman year of college.

If you've stuck with my story for this long, thank you. Now all that remains is the question I started with - how much trouble am I in?

Quitting today!

So after about two years of smoking, one of those years being very kept under the radar from my wife, I am officially quitting smoking. I cannot stand the way it makes me feel and the fact that I have to lie about it to everyone in my life. Any tips for a 20 year old quitting cold turkey?


EDIT: corrected a typo.

10 freakin days :-)

Almost 11... 120 cigarettes not smoked :-) and 250 hours smoke free too..  my skin looks clearer.. I feel much more energetic.. I actually wanna get out of the bed in the morning. When I see someone smoking I just think, YOU ARE STRONGER THAN YOU THINK. I am no longer a slave to the cancer stick.

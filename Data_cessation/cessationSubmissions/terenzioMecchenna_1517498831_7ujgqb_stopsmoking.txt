Accidentaly smoked two cigs in a 2 weeks span, feeling deep depression/suicidal

Guys, i quit for like 8/9 months, then in the nye i smoked One, and last saturday another.

Is like three days that I cannot stop crying for nothing, feel empty and depressed as fuck, nothing like this situation I've ever felt. Also afraid of killing myself....

Please Can anyone refer? Btw on the 10th february I'll check a psychologist

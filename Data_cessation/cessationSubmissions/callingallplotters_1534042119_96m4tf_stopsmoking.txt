I’m at 15 days with no cheats

One night I considered smoking some old butts in my ashtray, but they were so low I thought it would be a waste. That was about a week ago. Since turning that down, I’ve had no real cigarette cravings. When I’m stressed I just take a break, kind of like before but instead of making things worse on my body and mind, I think it makes me healthier.

Thinking about it is maybe dangerous for me, I’m an over-analyzer, but I just wanted to check in with a small but important total up on the board, if anyone is looking for recent quitters that are sticking with it. Planning on checking in every 15 days for the three months, and then once a month after that.

2 days down

I was a smoker for almost 14 years and quit smoking about 49 hours ago. The cravings for nicotine have not been terrible yet but the habit of going out to smoke when I get overwhelmed is still really strong. Since I didn't want to use NRT, I have been "smoking" my coffee stirrer instead. Lol. Does anyone have any tips or tricks of what to do to break this habit?

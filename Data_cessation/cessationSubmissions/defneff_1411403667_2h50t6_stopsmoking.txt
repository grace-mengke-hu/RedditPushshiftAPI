7 Days and 10 hrs

I decided to quit smoking and initially took the 1st pill of chantix.  After 1 day on this terrible drug I realized that cold turkey was my only option.  After a lot of sun flower seeds, gum, and a new gym membership it is getting easier every day.  Although I know that a cigarette is something that I will always want I have finally realized that it is ok to not partake in things that are pleasurable for the sake of it.  I want everyone else to know that after 20 years and a pack and 1/2 a day you can do this!!!

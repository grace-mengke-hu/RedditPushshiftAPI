Any one feel sick after climbing steps?

So tonight I was coming back with a friend and they went ahead of me as they carrying an island for my apartment and I was carrying 4 grocery reusable bags weighing a bit.  I live on the top of a 3 floor building without an elevator.  

I went up the stairs and by the time that I hit the top I was out of breath, coughing and feeling like I was going to hurl.  It took me a minute or so before I could stand up fully again and make my way to my apt door.  My friend had got the keys to my place and went and got me a glass of water as they were worried about me.  It worried me as well and am wondering, is this normal?

11 Days

I started smoking 11/12 years ago around the age of 13/14. I've tried quitting numerous times before, the longest I managed was 3 days. 


I'm fed up. I'm reading down the posts of everyone saying they feel better, and can't believe they didn't do it sooner. I don't. I've saved Â£22 so far, gained 4 lbs, have no energy at all, and I'm making continuous efforts to watch what I'm saying because I'm still wanting to jump down everybody's throats for speaking to me. Food doesn't taste better. My teeth haven't got whiter. I'm honestly just miserable. I thought I'd feel good, and get the weird chesty stuff that means my chest is clearing. 


On the plus side. I've sat I  cars with people smoking, I've rolled my boyfriend cigarettes, I've had a glass of alcohol... all usually things that would make me want to smoke myself... Not a flicker of temptation.

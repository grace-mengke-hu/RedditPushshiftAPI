Stress relief

Lately work along with other things has been stressing me quite a bit and I've turned to cigs to relax. I think I might go back to my old method of sucking it up cause it's only a part time summer job, but at times it can be overwhelming. It also is an excuse to take a quick break at work. What else can I do besides smoke?

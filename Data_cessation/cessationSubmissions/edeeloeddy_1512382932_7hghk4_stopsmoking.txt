Quit weed but cant quit cigs help me

I posted this on the leaves subreddit because i was a heavy smoker(still am) but atleast im not getting high all the time.. I used to smoke a pack a day now I have weaned it down to about half a pack a day and cant go any further than that. 

I tried quitting smoking cold turkey last year and it felt like I was literally going mad lol, so this year im trying to take it step by step but it feels impossible. So can anyone please help me I already have been going to the gym and I eat a healthy diet what can I do????

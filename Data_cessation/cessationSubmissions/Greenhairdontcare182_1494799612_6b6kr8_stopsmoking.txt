Quit smoking 10 days ago and this is the second time I've been out drinking and not smoked, I'm very happy with myself right now.

I haven't smoked for nearly as long as most people on here but none the less I've smoked heavily for over 7 years. I quit because my new job requires me to be physically fit and I'm tired of the constant coughing and chest pains. I'm quite a social person and I smoked twice as much when I had a few drinks so I put off my social life to avoid slipping. Today was the second time I went out and drank and although the cravings were there when I saw my friends rolling their cigarettes, all I did was remember how far I've come and how great I feel, and throwing that away was not worth it. 

And I didn't slip up! I feel like I have this in the bag! 


Edit: thank you all so much for the kind words!

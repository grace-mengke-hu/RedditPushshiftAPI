Experience with 1-800-QUIT-NOW coaching program?

Hey r/stopsmoking - I had a quick question for most of you. I've recently seen a lot of the 1-800-QUIT-NOW commercial advertisements on TV with smokers giving tips about living with health problems, and I was wondering if any of you have any experience with the program?

What exactly does the program offer, and what were your thoughts on it, if you had used it?

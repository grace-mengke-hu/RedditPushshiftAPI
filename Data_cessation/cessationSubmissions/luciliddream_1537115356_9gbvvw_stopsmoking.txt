Have to quit for my health

Hey y'all I'm 27 year old female whose just been recently diagnosed with MS. It's taken a long time to come to terms with having a progressive illness and I've pretty much been smoking steadily all year. It's incredibly bad for MS and in general. 

I've been smoking for 11 years with a 2 year break when I had my daughter. But came back to smoking after a good bit. 

Now I know this is no joke, no matter what challenges I face quitting if I don't, I'm going to die a lot faster. I could miss my daughter's graduation, her wedding, hell, I could miss my wedding. (Fiance of 6 years). 

I would like to slow down to half cigarettes and then I have a date set for myself to not allow any further smoking.

I appreciate any advice and tips on this method of quitting. Thanks

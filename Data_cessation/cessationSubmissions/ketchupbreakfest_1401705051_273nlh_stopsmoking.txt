Just broke up at gfs cousins wedding.

So here I am stuck about a 17 hour drive from my home, in a hotel room with my ex gf waiting for the morning so I can hop on the plane with her family pretending everything is alright. I quit smoking about a month ago and I honestly did it for her (i hoped it would improve our relationship) but the good news is despite this terrible event I still don't want to go back to smoking. 28 days and counting!

EDIT: I just want to say thank you to all of you for the support! Some of these comments actually brought tears of joy to my eyes, faith in humanity restored!

Finding it really hard to resist the urges when drinking...

Hi guys,

So I've been a non-smoker for about 2 weeks now, but whenever I'm drinking it is mentally hard to resist a fag. It also doesn't help that most of my friends are smokers.

I've passed this evening at the pub without one but I looked on with envy at the people lighting up thinking "mmm, I'd smash a ciggy right now". So how do you guys deal with not smoking when you're having a bevvy?

Cheers

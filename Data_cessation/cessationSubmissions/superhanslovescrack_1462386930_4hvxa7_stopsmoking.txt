After eating food

Hi, long time lurker, first time poster. (so sorry for any mistakes). I would like to talk about how to combat the need to smoke after having a meal. The urge is incredible, since a smoke after any meal was a common thing for me (for the past 4 years).

I've just had my dinner, and it's getting too much. 

How can I handle it? Any tips?

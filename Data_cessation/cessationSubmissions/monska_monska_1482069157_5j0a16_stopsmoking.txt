18 days and many more to go

I quit smoking18 days ago and I feel great! I was surprised, that the quitting was quite easy for me. What helped me - and still helps me - is an App where I can see how much money I have already saved, how my health is getting better and better and I also get tasks to do for every day. 
Yesterday I was at a christmas party. There I met a colleague who was even a bit mad at me, that I stopped smoking. She also made fun of me, because I said, that it is 17 days without smoking. She said that 17 days is nothing and she already had quit smoking for 7 years. And now she is smoking again.
I wasn't mad at her, I only thought, I don't want to be like this. I want to be proud of what I've already reached. Most of my friends are also very proud of me but I have to be aware, that there are also people, who seem to be jealous and maybe they will offer me a cigarette and try to mislead me. But I will be stronger!

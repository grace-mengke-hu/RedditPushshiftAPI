I wanted to smoke so bad tonight

I’ve been smoke free for 24 days and 23 hours as of this minute and I was so tempted to smoke tonight. I wasn’t able to put on my nicotine patch today but was doing fairly well without it.

My grandma died last night. Her birthday is on the 28th. She was the best and I loved her like a Mom and honestly sometimes even more than I loved my own mom. I’m glad I got to talk to her even for just a bit yesterday. Her death was tragic and sudden and I just hope she didn’t suffer. Every year she says that she can’t wait to be with God and I tell her she’s probably gonna outlive most of us because she was such a strong person. I hope that she is happy and I hope she knows how much she meant to me.

She always brags about how the doctors say that she has the cleanest lungs because she never had a smoke in her life. I never met my grandpa because he died of lung cancer while my mom was pregnant with me. I’d like to think she will be so disappointed in me if she finds out I started smoking again or took even just one puff. She used to joke about how she’s gonna haunt me if I’m being shitty and I’d tell her I won’t be that mad if she does.

It’s 3:24 am and I still can’t sleep. I’m chewing on a nicotine gum while writing this. I’m always scared of picking up smoking again but now I want to be strong too. I love you Mama I hope you’re at peace.

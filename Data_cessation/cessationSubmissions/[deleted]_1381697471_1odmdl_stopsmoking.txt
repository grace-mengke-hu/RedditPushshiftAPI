I stopped drinking 6 days ago and stopped smoking today!

I just finished Allen Carr's book and I feel so motivated to pursue a life without those poisonous killer stimulants. I had quit before for 10 months but then I stupidly started "trying" a couple cigarettes here and there, thinking I had it all under control and even if I got hooked again, I would easily quit again because I have already once quit. I was so wrong...

The last 2 years I've been trying to quit literally every week, just to light another one. There were at least failed attempts in that time. I tried so much that it has become a joke subject in my social circle :D But I knew I would eventually conquer that monster so I kept trying. 

Now after I finished the book, I remember how I managed to quit last time. I had forgotten the process of thought that helped me the 1st time. This time I've quit for good.

Happy non-smoking everybody!

All the best ;)

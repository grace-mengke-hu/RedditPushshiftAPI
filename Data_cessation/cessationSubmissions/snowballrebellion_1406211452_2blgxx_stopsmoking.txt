1 Year Today!

Today is my mother's birthday and also my 1 year anniversary of quitting smoking. She always hated how much I smoked so I thought it would be the perfect day to quit. So here I am, 1 year smoke free all thans to you guys and "The Easy Way" by Allen Carr. Thanks guys for helping me stick to the best decision of my life!  Edit: Thank you for all of the support, guys! This is why /r/stopsmoking can really make a difference!

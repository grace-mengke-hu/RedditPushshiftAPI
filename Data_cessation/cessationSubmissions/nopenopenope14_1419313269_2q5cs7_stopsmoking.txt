wanting to quit - is this a good way to do it?

I smoked for a year in high school, then quit for two years, then picked it up again about three months ago following a tremendous breakup/an incredible stressful new job. I'm pretty much done with it. I want to get in better shape, I want to stop smelling like an ashtray, and I hate spending the money. On top of that, I was in a pretty serious car accident about a month ago, saw the end of my life nearly happen, and now don't really want to be bringing that about any faster than it's already coming. 

Point is this. The nature of my job requires that I am not on a hair trigger or an emotional wreck for the next two months while I'm getting over withdrawal, etc. Right now I'm only smoking 4-5 cigarettes a day. I figure the best way to do it is just to not have one every single time I want one, and slowly cut down that way. 

What I'm wondering is if the pattern of allowing myself to get desperate for a smoke, then satisfying the desperation, then waiting until I'm desperate again is a good one to get into. Or if there's a better way to quit. I don't really care what. Any advice would be helpful. 

Also worth keeping in mind: I have generalized anxiety disorder and clinical depression. Mental state is usually tenuous at best. So really I need to know how to handle that in conjunction with quitting. 

Thanks, guys.

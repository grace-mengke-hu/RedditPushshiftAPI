Resetting my badge.

Yep, smoked.  It doesn't seem to make a difference if I'm on lozenges or going cold turkey.  That 'I want a cigarette' idea pops into my head, seemingly randomly, and nothing I do helps me get it back out.  I tried waiting it out, I tried reasoning it out, but in the end it always wins no matter what I do.  I'm sorry guys, I let myself down and I let you all down.  I'm not sure how I'm going to proceed from here, the 'fuck it!'s are quite strong.

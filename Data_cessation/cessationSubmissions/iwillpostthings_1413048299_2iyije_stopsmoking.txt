Sore throat - quit 2 months ago. Is this normal? :/

Ive been an on and off smoker for 5 years - longest time being consecutive 8 months - and i recently quit beginning of september FOR GOOD partly thanks to this
 sub. Problem is im feeling a lot of discomfort in my throat still and I have trouble swallowing sometimes. It feels like a lump in my throat - is this common? Especially after a couple months of quitting?

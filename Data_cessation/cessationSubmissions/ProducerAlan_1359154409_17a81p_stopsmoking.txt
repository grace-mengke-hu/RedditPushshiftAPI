What do you do during your "smoke breaks"?

I'm on day 3. It's going well. Days 1 and 2 were my days off, so I wasn't under any sort of stress and could focus on not focusing on cigarettes. Here's the thing: I work at a place that really doesn't care how many breaks you take, as long as you get your work done. That has caused me to get used to smoking about once an hour.

My problem now is that I'm bored. I don't feel like I want to smoke; I just want to take a break from work. But I've gotten two cups of coffee and three cups of water and chatted everybody up. I don't want to go outside because that's where the other smokers are.

So what do you do to fill that time?

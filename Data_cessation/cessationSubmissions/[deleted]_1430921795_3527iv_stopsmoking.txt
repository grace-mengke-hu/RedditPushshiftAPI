Tips for breaking the cycle of being smoke-free on and off?

Today is my day 0 for the millionth time. I started smoking a week before I turned 13, and ever since I've been on this terrible cycle of smoking for ~6 months, quitting for ~3-6 months, and back on. I realized I've been smoking almost half my life, and I'm ready to make this the permanent last time.


Is it appropriate for me to write the things I love about smoking? I would like to share with someone:

* 10 minutes of respite from all the trouble in my life, multiple times a day

* The lovely feeling of smoke filling my lungs (I really love this more than anything, and feel like my addiction is more associated with that feeling than actual nicotine)

I need help

Hello everyone. I'm writing this because I can't take it anymore and need help. I quit smoking 16 days ago and sometime urges take 3-4 hours and feels like I'm dying. I tend to cry sometimes and feel very depressed and sometimes hate myself.(Just now I'm in the middle of an urge also) Actually i got no reason to quit except the dopamine thing. But, whatever you think, smoking is a good social habit and I got no motivation to quit and maybe that's why urges take that much time. What can I see as motive to keep myself away from cigarettes. I'm open to any suggestions. Sorry for bad English. Thank you all.

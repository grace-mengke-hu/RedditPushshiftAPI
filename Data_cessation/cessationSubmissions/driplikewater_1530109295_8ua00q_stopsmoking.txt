Cigarettes Had Ruined My Life.

This sounds like an overstatement, but looking in my past I realized there were many moments where I screwed up significant portions of my life, just to try to relieve my nicotine addiction.

When I was 14, my brother got me hooked as he was bored and out of high school and needed something to play with. He got me to ditch school, even though I was in honors classes, to come smoke cigarettes with him. I thought I was cool, I was convinced that adults were dumb and he was smart and I was making the right decision. 

That being said, I failed high school. It was a struggle and I would miss important tests and classes to alleviate my withdrawals that I had justified with the mind of a teenager. 

Flash forward later in life. I was 23, I became a Banker at a bank that rhymes with "Bells Hargo". I thought I was top shit. They gathered all the new hires together, about 60 of us at a huge office complex to go over the teaching. When we split for break, I was the ONLY one who asked "where's the smoking section?"

She pointed to the dumpsters. Everyone laughed. I didn't care, the social exclusion was preferred for me. It made me feel special. Deep down, it stabbed like a knife and drastically effected my performance and self-esteem. I was also constantly penalized at many other jobs for taking too many smoke breaks. I had even been fired and left for unemployed for around 3 years, all while smoking and getting 800 a month checks, of which I'd spend around 300 on cigarettes. 

Cigarettes were always my line one on my budget. They were always more important than food, rent, my girlfriend, my family, my career, my health, ANYTHING. It was a "no brainer". I definitely had no brain, that's for sure.

I'm so happy I made the decision to put myself through the pain of quitting smoking. It's been over a month and I feel better, I have more money, respect from my peers and coworkers and more importantly, more respect for myself.

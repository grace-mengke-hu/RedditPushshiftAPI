Smoke free for more than a month, smoked a slim and a hand-rolled cigarette

My 4-month-old dog went missing this morning around 10am, and now it's 10pm. I haven't had such a sad and awful day since I can't even remember. Around 2pm I smoked a slim cigarette, and it tasted kinda weird, a few hours later I hand rolled a small cig, and smoked it. Now I do feel stupid, but can I close an eye on this? These 2 cigs confirmed that I don't really need them. I cried my heart out today and I just want to reunite with my dog now, I really hope he comes home or someone dials the number on his dog tag.

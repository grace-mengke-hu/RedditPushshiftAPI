103 days! I was thinking about dreams I had last night...

Habits don't die (or at least haven't yet) in my unconcious. Typical times I would light up, I still do sometimes in my dream, as if my dreamself is still living 4 months ago. 


In my waking life, I don't experience cravings. Whenever I see someone smoking, I just feel bad for them and think "that sucks man, I'm sorry you're still addicted. Hopefully you'll be able to quit some day, too." The smell of smoke doesn't bother me, and it doesn't make me crave a cigarette. It's just cigarette smoke, something that used to be a part of my life.


Now though, in my dreams, if I get into a car, I light up. If I say so long to my friends at the bar and start walking home, I light up for the walk. However, there's always this nagging feeling in my head saying "something's wrong..." and I can't quite pinpoint what it is. Then, it hits me. Sometimes halfway through the cigarette, sometimes not until moments after I've finished. When I realize "oh, shit. I don't smoke anymore. That was the first cigarette I've had in months!" I don't think "man, what a relief." I don't feel the false "relaxation." I feel immense shame. I almost want to break down and cry for throwing away the last three months of not smoking. I feel the fear of how the next three days are going to be now that I've inhaled that incredibly addictive substance. It's horrible.



Then I wake up. I can't tell you how happy I am waking up from those dreams, knowing I didn't actually smoke. It's those feelings of guilt, shame, and fear that make me know I'm never going to smoke again.

How can I deal with the cravings?

Here's my full story:

I'm a university student and had been smoking prior to going to uni (about 6 months) I didn't smoke that much until I got to uni, and that's when things (what you might say) to a turn for the worst.

Unfortunately I now have a habit of smoking, at some times it could be so bad I could be having a fag every 30 minutes, and on better days 2-3 days, I'm sure that's not on par with some of the /r/stopsmoking
redditors but I thought I should let anyone who reads this know. The habit can also include me smoking one soon after I've woken up, but I won't want another one till 3-4 hours afterwards.

It seems that since I have this habit now I can't really give it up. I have tried to give it up several times in the past (recently) before Christmas, but for some reason after the 1st or second day it just becomes unbearable (At one point I needed one so bad that at 2am with it raining heavy I walk to a petrol station 20 minutes from my halls, to find it closed, I then walk back and take some puffs on one that's already been used) Gross I know.

What I'm trying to ask is how did you people manage to give up and what were the cravings like? - And, why did you like it?

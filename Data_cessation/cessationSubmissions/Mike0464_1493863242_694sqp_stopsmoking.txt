Those Darn commercials

Here in Michigan l keep seeing these horrific ads on tv with smokers maimed with cancer from smoking. They show them in hospital beds and such. At the end they show their death date after just seeing them alive. Some of them were only in their 40's. Its scary as hell. Has anybody seen these?

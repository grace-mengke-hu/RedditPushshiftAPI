Official quit date on September 1st. Not sure how things are looking right now

Tried setting my quit date late last week, a day or so after visiting the Dr.  Didnt work out too well and was only on the patches.  

Tried a second quit date yesterday and did good.  Switched from lozenges to patches but quickly found out it wasnt enough.  Felt like i was about to lose my mind all day long.  Ended up going back to the drug store and getting more patches.  Still, even with all that, i only had 3 cigarettes yesterday.

Biggest hurdle im facing isnt the nicotine withdraw.  I have plenty of options for satisfy that.  Patches for most of the day, a lozenge when things get rough but its not enough.  Im missing the throat hit, that feeling in your chest when you inhale a cigarette

Anyone have any good ideas on how to make that better?  I have thought about getting a vape but i dont just want to substitute cigs for vaping.  I know its the lesser of two evils but still seems like a substitution and a easy out to go back to cigarettes later.

Anyone on here have any advice for me on the 2nd part?  Right now im mostly in the green but still absolutely missing that throat hit part of the equation

My boss is not happy that I'm trying to quit smoking

This weekend my husband and I decided that we were ready to quit smoking, after hearing our 5 year old daughter casually talk about cigarettes. I'm halfway through with day 1, and my boss is not happy that she's lost her smoking buddy. She's trying to convince me to just wean off of them instead of cold turkey like I'm doing and it is really chipping away at my resolve. Is one way of quitting better than the other? I have smoked for 15 years and it seems that when I try to wean off them, I get down to a few a day then something stressful happens and the count goes way up. Thanks for any advice.

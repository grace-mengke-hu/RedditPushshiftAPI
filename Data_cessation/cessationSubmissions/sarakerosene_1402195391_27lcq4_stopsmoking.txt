It's been 6 days. I have an ecig, but I'm having a huge craving right now. Help!

Ignore my count... I never reset it from my last attempt. It's been 6 days since I've had a cigarette

Got a 24mg liquid ecig in the car. I just finished a big meal... My boyfriend smokes... And I could easily ask him for one... But I can't. I don't want to. I won't. But I do want to. But I can't.

Ugh cigs are evil. I just need to twiddle my thumbs and suck down that ecig in a bit. How do you beat extra sucky cravings?

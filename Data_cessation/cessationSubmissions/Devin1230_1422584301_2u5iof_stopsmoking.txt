Fairly new to smoking, very new to quitting.

I used to smoke occasionally in High School with my friends or at  party's up until I went to College. Then one day I was craving one cigarette so went and bought a pack and had been frequently smoking ever since. Fastforward 7 months to now and I am a Week and 3 days into quitting and trying not to look back. For me the hardest part is not just having that "one cigarette"  I crave ever so much. Good Luck everyone :)

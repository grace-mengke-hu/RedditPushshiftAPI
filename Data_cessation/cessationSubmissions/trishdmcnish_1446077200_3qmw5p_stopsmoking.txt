Sneaky little sneaksticks

Oh, they're sneaky. I'm almost convinced that they might be able to slither right out of their sneaky little pack and sneak their way right between my unsuspecting lips (okay that sounds nasty).

But in all seriousness, these little fuckers are insidious. How can something that seems so inert, so benign, be so fucking POWERFUL? How can it be over a month (hello, badge, time to catch up with me here, buddy), and still... they're everywhere. Like there's a little cigarette in my head - I'm going to call it a she, because it's manipulative, yet alluring, yet seems so innocent and innocuous. 

She says "But look, your friend over there quit a year ago, and she's able to have a couple smokes on a night out, and go back to not smoking! Seeeeee.... I'm not sooooo bad, am I? Come onnnnn.... you still love meeeee.... you waaaaant meeeeeeeee.... don't you?"

I'm like "no bitch! Leave me alone"

She comes back with "we've been together soooooo long, I can't believe you would just DUMP me! I've always been there for you, when you're in pain, when you're stressed out - who do you ALWAYS have to turn to? That's right, meeeeee...."

Fucking sneaky little sneaksticks.

"I'm not that sneaky... I'm right here, in front of you. I've got nothing to hide. You know everything there is to know about me! How can I be THAT BAD? I've never hurt you have I?"

And I respond, "not that I know of. Not YET. But you take all my money, and I can't stop thinking about you."

She says "ohhhhh but we're a team! We work together, your money is my money! I can't stop thinking about you either... I'm always thinking about you. It's okay. Go away for a couple of days, for a month even, if you need to. Take all the time you neeeeeeed.... I'll always be right here.... waiting"

Le sigh.

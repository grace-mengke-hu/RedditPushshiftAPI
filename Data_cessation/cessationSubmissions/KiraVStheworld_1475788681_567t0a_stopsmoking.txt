I miss a high!

Hello fellow quitters! I stopped smoking after 8 years about 5 days ago. This year i tried it before and made it till day 30. This time im gonna make it! Thing is even tho i dont really miss smoking i miss the high it gave me. I dont drink alcohol neither do i take drugs period. Sports is giving me a 20 minute high, example running and that is not enough as well as not the most pleasant high. How do you deal with that? I always loved the soft high of nicotine that makes you feel good. Greetings to you!

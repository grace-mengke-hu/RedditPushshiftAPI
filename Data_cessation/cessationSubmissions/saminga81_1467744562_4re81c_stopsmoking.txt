I F#CKING DID IT!!!!!

HOLY SHIT! I've been smoke free since Mar 8th of this year!  All I had to do was break my leg in 6 places.  After I decided to destroy my leg, the doc told me that smoking would slow the healing process.  I didn't want anything to keep me off my feet for longer than I had to.  I still have cravings every once in a while but they're so weak I just keep on rolling, literally.  I'm still not able to walk yet, but probably will be in 3 days after I see the doc again!

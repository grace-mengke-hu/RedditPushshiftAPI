Thai tip

Smoke free's mission today was to memorialize what got me to almost three weeks without smoking. And post those tips here. 
Mine are mostly the usual, the four Ds, the personal commitment illustrated by going to class, etc. 
One thing different that I did do and find most helpful: a Thai herbal inhaler. When I get the urge, I take a whiff of healthy smelling herbs & camphor, and  good!

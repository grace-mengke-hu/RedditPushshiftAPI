Having a hard time trying to quit.

Hi everyone, I'm a 20 year old male who's been smoking for about 2 years now. In the last couple months my smoking has gotten a bit out of hand for me, with me smoking at least half a pack a day. I decided last week I wanted to quit, so I stopped cold turkey.

It was fine the first day or so, but as the next four days went on, I was super irritable and fell into a depression that was deeper than any I've had in over a year. So I started smoking again. I bummed a cigarette from a guy, but after I smoked it I bought another pack. I'm telling myself that this will be the last one.

My friends are trying to help me, my parents don't know I smoke, but none of them are smokers, so they don't really understand. Smoking for me has helped a lot with anxiety and depression, and even though I'm on medications for that, It helps a lot more.

I'm just trying to figure out some tactics. Does weening off of cigarettes work? Like trying to smoke one less a day? Anyone have good tactics to cope with the withdraws?

Thanks redditors, just need some help and a community that understands where I'm coming from.

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!

I would probably chop off my own finger if I could have a cig right now without any remorse or repercussions! This is the worst craving I  have felt for a few weeks and I am really struggling. Not with the fact that I might give in, I know I won't, but struggling with not going mad ha ha. 

New quitters - don't be discouraged by my post please. Things are better overall and I know things will get easier than things are right now as it is already easier than it was.

Good luck to all :)

4 days in

This isn't my first time to try and quit. I did the chantix thing for about 3 and a half months but like my previous attempts, it failed. I had read on this sub that in order to really quit you had to really want to quit. I'm a big runner. This last month had been pretty hectic so I decided to stop running and focus on other things. Well, I started running again 4 days ago today and I honestly felt like complete crap! My lungs stopped working, I was getting tired easily, and my muscles didn't perform. I can still remember when I used to be able to take weeks off and then just jump right back in it no problem. After that day I made the decision that I didn't want to feel that way anymore. I just really hope that this time I will remember all those negative side effects smoking causes next time I'm craving a cigarette.

Thanks for your support!

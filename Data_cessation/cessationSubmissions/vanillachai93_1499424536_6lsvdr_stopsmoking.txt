Anyone ever have this experience when quitting?

So basically I've been thinking about quitting again. The last time I tried this was about a year ago and it was cold turkey. I didn't last very long. I switched to vaping with juices that contained zero nicotine. The cravings were hard but bearable. But then on the 7th day, everything felt very wrong and even the tiniest things would tip me off. I believe depression was also setting in. I caved and finally had a cigarette and honestly the moment the cigarette touched my lips I felt like I left reality. Like what I would imagine a psychotic break would be like. After a few hours that feeling of wrong/impending doom/ third person state went away. The withdrawal felt so drastic that I'm really reluctant to quit again due to what's going to happen on that day. Has anyone else felt this? What are tips you can suggest? I've thought about Wellbutrin or Chantix but I already have had less than pleasant experiences with depression and Wellbutrin before I started smoking year ago. Should I try tapering off by vaping with juices that do contain nicotine? I'm nervous when thinking about quitting

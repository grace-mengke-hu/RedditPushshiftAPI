Been ready to stop but unable to for awhile

So, I'm not that great at forum/chat stuff but I feel like I need the help. I've been at the point where I literally hate smoking, even as I desperately wait for an opportunity to do so for awhile now. 

I stopped for about half a year once a few years back, along with my wife. But then coworkers got me into it again  because that's all we did to socialize during training. I have all the reasons to quit I need, and honestly, the desire. But quitting on my own without someone else also going through it has proven much more difficult and I've failed every time.

Read some stuff about different ways to do so. One site said pick some date a month out, and then prepare by analyzing what your triggers are, how to avoid or replace those activities, and stock up on some healthy snacks like nuts or whatever to eat during cravings. And then of course get a nicotine patch. It was on the nicoderm website though, so I'm sure they're biased to patches.

I guess what I'm hoping to get from posting here and following what the rest of you are going through is that feeling of doing it along with others, that helped me succeed the longest when my wife and I did it. As well as any pointers you may have.

Are patches really the thing to do? Or should I just finish the pack I have and tough through the pain and not buy another one? I'm sure it's different for every person but I personally don't know the best 'plan' for quitting.

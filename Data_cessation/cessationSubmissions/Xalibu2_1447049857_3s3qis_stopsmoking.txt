So I set a goal. Any insight or help would be much appreciated.

So I REALLY want to stop smoking. I have been at it since high school and am now in my early thirties. I have two young children. Which are my primary motivators to make this happen. Essentially I don't want to tell them I need space when I smoke. I don't want them to see me smoke. I just really don't want to smoke anymore. Obvious reasons are health and well being. Also I assume it's obvious I'm quite addicted. I come from a family that most smoked or still do. I guess my worry is my smoking will make them more likely to pick it up. Which has been proven right? I tried gum. Lasted about a week. I then used the gum and cigs for about a month. I have also quit cold turkey for 3 months once and once more for about 40 days respectively. I guess my main concern is falling back into old habits if I'm (when) successful. My goal was ninety days. This was prompted by a goal setting exercise that was work related. Is 90 days giving myself too much time? Does this seem reasonable? 

I suppose I just would love to hear from people who have succeeded in finally giving the habit up and have insight into this matter. Also I wanted to add my wife is a smoker as well and I am worried this will make it a lot harder as she seems reluctant to give it up right now. I know her behavior should not reflect on my own, but we'll you know. Thanks in advance for any thoughts, ideas, experiences that might help me to really get serious about this. 

Sorry for the wall of text.

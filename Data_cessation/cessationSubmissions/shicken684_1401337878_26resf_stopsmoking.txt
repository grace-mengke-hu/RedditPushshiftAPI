Thank you all for helping me quit.

This sub was a good aid for me.  It's important to have a support system like this when most of your friends and family are smokers.  Some wish you well, some are assholes about it.  Here are the important bits.  I quit using a patch after failing at cold turkey and gum a few times.  No way in hell I could have done it cold turkey.  The patch was my crutch, and there is nothing wrong with using a crutch so you can heal.

Quitting has changed my life.  Everything I do feels better.  Eating is better, going for a walk is better, sex is better.  My girlfriend and future wife would have never gone out with me if I was a smoker.  I did something I never thought possible and it's been awesome!  

The first few days are rough, patch or not, it will consume your thoughts.  Just power through, and don't make excuses for yourself.  Your brain wants nicotine so it will come up with stupid fucking reasons that you should go back to smoking.  Don't listen, and just find something to occupy yourself. You might blow past the first few weeks and think you are in the clear.  Some are, most aren't.  I had cravings for months, and months, and I still get the occasional craving today.  I don't think they will ever go away.  However, there is a difference, as the cravings now are silly, weak, and last seconds.  You will laugh at them like I do.  

I am now to the point where I can get stupid drunk and not look at a person smoking with envy.  When that moment hit, I knew I had won.  I won't ever smoke again, and I will get to enjoy a longer, happier, healthier life because of it.  

This sub got me through some tough times and was a forum for my frustrations and venting.  It also gave me encouragement from those people who had gone through it, struggled like hell, and came out clean.

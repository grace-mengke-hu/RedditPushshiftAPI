Some tips would be greatly appreciated

I began smoking about 6 months ago. I convinced myself that I would not make a habit of it but here I am smoking 2 to 6 cigarettes per day. And the worst part is every time I smoke I realize that this is not what I want but still I cant resist. I tried to stop but only got as far as a week several times before I smoked again. I have googled many articles to stop this disgusting habit. Nothing has helped. And I would really like some real advice from the people who have succeeded to quit this habit for good.

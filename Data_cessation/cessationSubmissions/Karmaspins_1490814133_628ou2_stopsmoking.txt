I've been smoking for 22 years/Just quit drinking.

6 days off drinking after 22 years.  Going much easier than I thought.  I would love to just both these fuckers out at the same time.  Has anyone else who has been successful with quitting both quit both at once?  All advice is helpful.  Even crazy advice, I'm super ready to take the leap.  Thank you.

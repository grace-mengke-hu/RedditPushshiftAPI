60 Days Tomorow! 

A few weeks before christmas, I quit smoking. I read allen carr's book. It was the first time I had ever heard of him, and it changed everything. Before, I believed I was addicted for life, and that I would never quit. I started smoking at 15-16 and just now quit right before my 22nd birthday.

My mom was a chain smoker for most of my life, I thought I was addicted to the second hand smoke before I ever picked up my first cigarette. My quitting has inspired her to quit. She has bought and read every allen carr book there is, but she needed a little extra boost and started taking Chantix, too. Today is her first week down!

Another woman I inspired to quit is a 55 year old woman who has been smoking since high school. I told her about the book, and she is also on her 1st week without cigarettes.

I also got my boyfriend to quit, although he didn't read the books, he was just impressed with how easy I made it look. and how much money he would (has) saved. Tomorrow will be his 1st month down!

I wouldn't have been able to do it without stumbling onto this community. Best of luck everyone! keep on keepin' on.

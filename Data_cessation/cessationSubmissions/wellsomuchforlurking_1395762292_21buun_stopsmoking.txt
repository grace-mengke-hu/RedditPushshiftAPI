1 Year smoke free!

This is my third time quitting, but also my last. I have survived every season change and all the smoking triggers that went with it. Spring/Summer - smoking on my patio with my morning cup of coffee. Winter - tailgating at football games smoking a pack of cigarettes. Stressed out at work - go downstairs for a cigarette. Bored at home - go have a cigarette. No more:

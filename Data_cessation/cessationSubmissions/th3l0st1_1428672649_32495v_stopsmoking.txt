The urge to smoke is strong today.

Nothing is going well in my life right now. And you know the feeling of depression you get when you just want to self destruct? That's what I am feeling. And not smoking is the only thing keeping me together. 

I am not going to smoke. I hope I make it. because thats the only way I dont descend into depression and madness.

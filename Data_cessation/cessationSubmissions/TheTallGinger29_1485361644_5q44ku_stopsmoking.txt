I really want to quit, but after 2-3 days I give in. How do you stay motivated to quit smoking?

So every time I try to quit smoking, I last 2-3 days before eventually giving in and buying another pack. I know I want to quit, but every time I make it to 2-3 days I just think "Eh, screw it" and then regret it as soon as I've finished the first one. Please help, how do you stay motivated to make it past day 3, and then week 1, week 2 and so on? I have tried vaping and this does help, however I always end up going back to cigarettes.

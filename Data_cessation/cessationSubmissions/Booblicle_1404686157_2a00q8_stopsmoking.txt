Just another benefit.

Today I did my usual routine. Woke up early, had my 1 cup of Joe, walked the dog, then started my jog.  After my jog I started doing my stretches and it was an unusually sweaty day. Perhaps a little hotter than I'm used to jogging in but I couldn't tell. 

What I did notice though is I was in fact pretty damn hot. ( also not unusual for the first 5 minutes of stretching )  And a few things occurred to me in regards to smoking. That it used to be a trigger, or at least a reason to light up. "Fuck this heat, I need a smoke". Then I thought about the sweat. I used to loath sweat with a passion. It was sticky, and salty , the shit got in your eyes.  "Fuck that shit!." Most of that saltiness I now realized was all the shit from cigarettes sticking on your skin. It is also what made it feel sticky. Now sweat doesn't bother me at all, even drenched in it. and in fact it nearly freezes me in 80-90 degree weather after a jog.

Well ok, im not being completely honest. I still don't like getting the shit in my eyes so I carry a small baby towel to brush away the sweat.

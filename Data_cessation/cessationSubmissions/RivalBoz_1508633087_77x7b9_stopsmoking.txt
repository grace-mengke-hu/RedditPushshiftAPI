I've smoked for 10 years now and I'm turning 24 next month.

I've tried to quit 4 times in my life, the second time I did it for 6 months but I've relapsed after a bad relationship.
I'm a very nerve wrecked person when I don't smoke, smoking keeps me sane in a way.
the only time it really worked for me was when I quit cold turkey. unfortunately, almost everyone I know smokes, even in my household.
what are your suggestions to become smoke-free?

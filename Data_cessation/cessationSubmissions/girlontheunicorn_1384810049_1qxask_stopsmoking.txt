Day 3!

It has been 3 days since I've smoked and the cravings suck! My boyfriend has been trying to talk me into quitting with him and I think this is going to be the time I stick it out. We tried to quit together this past summer, but I broke down about a week and a half in. I figure I work with  a lot of non-smokers, so it might work better this time. It just suucks at night. I was never a daytime smoker(weird?), but at night and when I'm bored at work I become a chimney and of course when I'm drinking. Have you ever gone out and drank all night but instead of an alcohol hangover you feel like you a nicotine hangover? That happened to me the other day and that's when this started. Also, my birthday is on Saturday so what better gift to give myself than the gift of health. Sorry this post is all over the place I just need some support and wanted to get some stuff off my chest  because I think my craving talk is driving my boyfriend mad. It seems to be way easier for him. Anyway thanks for listening!

You guys are helping me quit more than just smokes...

Last week, we were on vacation. Vacation means pictures. Pictures of how much weight I have gained over the past year... I was devastated. I wanted to cry. 

But you wanna know what I did instead? I applied the same logic and reasoning to sugar. I have a crazy sweet tooth.. it runs in the family. Much like smoking, if I have one I will just continue to have "one" until the entire package is gone. So I have walked away from it, and in a week I have lost 3 pounds. I can't go back... I don't have the self control at the moment to do it. Just like I can't "just smoke one" or "have a pack on hand just in case", I can't have just one cookie or have a pack of Oreos just in case. 

Just a little thought I wanted to share with you, because weight is something that we can see change.

I need help right now! Drinking and watching the NBA playoffs, I just hit two triggers. Comment ASAP.

I've quit plenty of times. My problem is staying quit. Deep down, I think this is actually the time that I can do it. It's been seven days, I'm almost through the first stage. I almost have all of the nicotine out of my body.  I've just read excellent post by /u/nananamacatman, I don't want to be a slave to Big Tobacco. Here is your chance, I need you to help me get past this urge. Tell me your stories and give me your advice, we can work through this together. Thank you so much for your help; if you can help me get through this, you are changing a life. I promise this is the time. I am no longer a slave to nicotine. (Sorry for any grammatical errors, like I said, I have been drinking, which is one of my largest triggers for nicotine)

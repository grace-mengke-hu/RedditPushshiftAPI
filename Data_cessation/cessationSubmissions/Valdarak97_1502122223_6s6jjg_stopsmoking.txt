I require motivation, logic, help to stop!

Hi everyone! So recently I decided that I want to quit smoking because it simply costs too much. That is my only issue with it though. I do not care about the health issues at all. So oh well I need to quit forever or at least until I can support it. 

I started smoking a pack a day recently so I can't really afford it anymore. I tried quitting but after like 30 hours I needed something to calm myself because I was stressed. Now that I think about it would reducing the amount I smoke help?

And in those 30 hours or so my appetite increased considerably so that is also a concern because I am on a diet (lost 13kg in the past 6 months).

I honestly do not know what help I need. How do you quit or how do you find the motivation required to do so?

Thanks in advance!

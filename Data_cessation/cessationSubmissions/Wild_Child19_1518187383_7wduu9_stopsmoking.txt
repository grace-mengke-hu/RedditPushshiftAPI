84 hours in, withdrawal symptoms are a pain but not smoking is the easy part.

I quit and later realized that I wasn't adequately prepared to quit, I struggled with the "Just one cigarette", "maybe if I just smoke one at the end of the week" for most of the hours. Then I found out that just smoking one cigarette would lead the withdrawal symptoms back to square one. 

In all honestly, it's the most difficult thing I've ever done in my life, and I would honestly do anything for a cigarette right now, anything except deal with the withdrawal symptoms all over again back.

Not smoking is the easy part, it's dealing and accepting with the fact that I'm never going to smoke again which is the hardest part. I was carrying a nearly full pack with me for the past few days, since my cravings were a lot worse when I found myself without them on me. As soon as I began to accept that I would have to start with the whole process all over again then I threw them away. 

Still, I haven't yet accepted the loss. Now thinking of how good that cigarettes would taste if I smoked one right now, I find myself wishing that I would've enjoyed and savored my last few cigarettes, I wish I would've spent a few days in between cigarettes instead of habitually smoking since a few days without it would make the cigarettes taste as good as they did when I was 15.

The only thing that diminishes my desire is the fact that it would be a total waste to go through the past 84 hours all over again. Dealing with the cravings, and how awful the withdrawal is, then not smoking is the easy part.

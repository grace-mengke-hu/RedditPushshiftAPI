Bronchial infection forcing me to quit after about 8 years

I had to go to the emergency room this afternoon. I've been feeling weak and tired for a few days, and I started feeling dizzy this morning. I've been coughing like mad, and a heavy coughing episode caused me to pass out. A friend brought me to the hospital, where they said my oxygen level was around 87%. The doctor gave me an inhaler and antibiotics and told me I have to quit smoking. Today was the first time I found myself agreeing when a doctor has told me this. Ive smoked for about 8 years and I've never tried to quit before. When I was picking up the prescriptions I also got some generic brand 4mg nicotine gum and have thrown away all tobacco related items, including lighters.
My questions are: what else should I get for this upcoming struggle? When can I expect the really hard part to end? Weeks? Months? How should I deal with my good friends and colleagues who still smoke? What triggers do I need to look out for?
I just joined this sub tonight, so I'm sure that posts like this surface all the time, and I'm sorry for the repitition. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

This time is for real!

After 25+ failed attempts and being an avid tobacco user for the past 6 years, this is it!!

Worked my way down from fine cut snuff to nicotine gum/snus pouches. I had my wisdom teeth out on Friday 1/15. Essentially, I have been forced to not have any nicotine (doctors orders) I head back to work tomorrow morning and passed the 72 hr mark. Any advice? A bad work day is usually what triggers me to get a can.

I will report back tomorrow with good news. Looking forward to getting my oral hygiene in tip-top shape and saving some $.

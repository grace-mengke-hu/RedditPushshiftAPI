Why quit?

Hey guys, I don't want to make anyone mad with my post here but I feel like I need more reasons to quit. I have been smoking cigarettes for 5 years and then vaping for the past 2 years. With EMT school coming up and a drug test in two weeks I figured I better quit, easier said than done right? Well I'm not having a good time to say the least. I quit just this morning and I have headaches, hot/cold flashes and irritability already. This just does not seem worth it to me, for all the time I've smoked I've never seen or had a problem with it myself and really have no desire to quit besides worrying I won't do well in school. How can I get through this?

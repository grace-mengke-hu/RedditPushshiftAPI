Guys.. help, I know 100% what my trigger is now and I'm in the middle of battle.

Alcohol. It is alcohol that makes me smoke..

when I drink, I want to smoke.. 100% confirmed and It's also 100% confirmed drunk status. 

What do I do? I've come far (it feels like it anywway) and where I am, deliberating whether to go buy some smokes or not.. I've still got a pint of disaronno left too. Shit.

I don't want to reset my counter to 1 in the next few days. 

I don't know if you can save me..

Question about quitting smoking timeline

So I'm sure we've all seen the quitting smoking timeline where there are benefits ranging from 20 minutes, 48 hours, 10 years etc. After quitting smoking. But I was wondering about something. Does anyone know if these numbers differ depending on how much a person smokes. Specifically, if ive been smoking for 2 months with one cigarette a day, will my breathing and circulation improve faster than a regular smoker who smokes a pack a day?

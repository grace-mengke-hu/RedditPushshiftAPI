A little tip that's worked for me (if you don't drink enough water already)

I'm a year and a half quit smoking, and 2 weeks quit vaping. I've been trying to drink my recommended water intake, and found that it actually helped with cravings/urges.

Whenever I felt the need to smoke, I reached for my water bottle instead. Now, I'm naturally mistaking my urge to smoke with thirst, so I'm getting in 2 litres+ a day now! Pretty cool right? Well I thought so anyway.

I don't know if this is a known method, I just kind of figured it out on my own and thought it may help someone else. It'll only work if you start keeping water handy, so get yourself a nice reusable bottle. That's all, I hope it helps someone!

I keep quitting and starting smoking

Hi everyone. I have smoked for 10 years and for the last 3 years I think I tried quitting 10 times. I stop smoking and then for various reasons (family problems, work problems, not wanting to endure pain, gaining pleasure) I start smoking again. Moreover, I think I am using my history of sexual abuse and PTSD as an excuse to continue smoking... Sometimes I experience trouble breathing and I decide to quit, but after a week when I can breathe properly, I start smoking again. My girlfriend and I are in the process of moving to another country where cigarettes are really expensive, so I will have to stop smoking for sure. My last quitting attempts were painless, so I think I can quit when the time comes.

My problem is that my SO is fed up with my quitting-and-starting-again cycle. I am also fed up with myself about this, but I cannot help it. This has become a psychological problem for me. Does anyone experience something like this?

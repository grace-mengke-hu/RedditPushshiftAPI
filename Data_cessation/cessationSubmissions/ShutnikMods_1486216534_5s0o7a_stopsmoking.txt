Random 48 days milestone, i guess.

I expected quitting cigs be painfull and hard to do, but, meh.

I quit in dec 2k16, first week is awfull, hands was itchy for a cancer stick like hell, every person with a sig was my fucking enemy #1. 

3 weeks later i tried vape. Without nicotine, just to replace need for a "smoke" something. Didn't like it, quit vape in 1 week or less. 

And now its almost 7 weeks? I don't wanna smoke, im not in pain, i don't feel anything.

I didn't feel better either.

No "better flavours" , or better smells, my health remains the same, i was a smoker for a decade.

I just expected... anything, you know? Just something.

Now i quit, and feel myself a little proud, but freaking empty.

fking life, man

Easyway didn't work.

I really want to quit smoking. There are no benefits and i feel that it's making me miserable. I actually quit for three months about 4 years ago. I had a bit of a ceremony with it. I was with a few friends, sitting on the front step sipping hot chocolate and i pulled out my last smoke and said, "this is my last smoke!" And i smoked it and that was it. I felt no pangs. I had no cravings. I was free. Then i got drunk with a friend that smokes and started smoking again. Now I'm at the point where i *really* want to quit. I made the decision that I'm done with it. I tried willpower, but that (of course) didn't work. So i read Allen Carr's Easyway to Stop Smoking. Finished it, had my last smoke, and just knew that I'd continue smoking. Now, armed with all the knowledge from the book, i feel more enslaved by it. The seminars don't happen in my city and i don't have the money to travel and spend 400$ to go to one. Im just so miserable. I feel like a failure. I don't know what to do.

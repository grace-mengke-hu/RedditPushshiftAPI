Keep going. You can do it.

It's hell. Honestly quitting is hell, and the thing that has kept me going this long is knowing that if I smoke another cigarette I will have to go through it all again. 

I smoked incessantly for 10 years. I am proud to say I have now not smoked a single cigarette in 9 months and I am much happier for it. Thank you to everyone here who got me this far - I relied on this sub a lot across the first few months. 

It is hard to quit, and it is rough. But please keep going. Your future self with thank you for it! Believe me - once you get far enough no money in the world will be enough for you to go back.

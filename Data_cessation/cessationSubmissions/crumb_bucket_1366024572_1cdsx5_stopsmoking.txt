Recently quit. Having a hard time with my dad's heavy use of nicotine lozenges.

Hi there. I quit 5 days ago after reading Allen Carr's book. I'd tried many times before using the patch, and had always eventually gone back to smoking when the patch was done.

The issue I'm having is with my dad. He is a former smoker who occasionally relapses and secretly has a pack. He is long-term dependent on nicotine lozenges and is almost always furiously working one around in his mouth. When I am around him I get the urge to smoke really badly and become irritable, etc. I also wish, for his benefit, that he didn't have to remain a slave to nicotine, but that's a whole other issue.

I see him almost every day and was wondering whether it would be better to force myself to deal with the urges, so that I can prove to myself that I can quit through anything, or avoid him for a bit, so that I don't chance caving on my quitting.

Can anyone help? Thanks in advance.

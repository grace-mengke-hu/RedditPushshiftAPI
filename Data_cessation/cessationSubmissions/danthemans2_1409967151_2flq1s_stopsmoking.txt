Honestly never thought I could make it this far.

It's been 53 days since my last cigarette. 53 days since the last time I inhaled the death stick. 5 years as a pack plus a day smoker to nothing. 

I love the feeling when people ask for a cigarette and I say, "Sorry I don't smoke anymore."
When I was smoking and the thought of quitting crossed my mind, I had this. "Yeah it won't be hard" thought, then it would turn into,"I don't see it possible, there is nothing I could do to fill this habit."

It becomes a part of your life, a part of you and your day to day, minute to minute routine. After quitting I have realized, I didn't have really any control to when I would smoke a cigarette. The cigarettes control you. Cigarettes whip you into their bitch. 

Now 53 days may not be the longest smoke free streak, but I will be damned if I am not proud of it. 

For any smokers out there who cant handle the thought of quitting, well, you can. Get angry at those cigarettes, and don't pick one up again.


Edit: Also, this subreddit really helped me quit, so anyone considering, stick around!

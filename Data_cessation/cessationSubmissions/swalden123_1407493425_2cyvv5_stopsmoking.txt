Does seeing how much smoking cost you, motivate you to quit?

Hi Guys, I am a designer looking at building an app to help smokers quit smoking. A lot of apps out there show what you save when you tell it you have quit. However as a flip to this, does seeing how much over the last month or so you have spent on cigarettes motivate you to stop?

Two days...

I smell the smoke on my jacket and it disgusts me. I've got a deep chest cough when I take a full inhale (which didn't happen when I smoked)... I'm already feeling better... but I still want a smoke.

I've been lurking here for a while and I think I'm finally ready to give it a serious shot.

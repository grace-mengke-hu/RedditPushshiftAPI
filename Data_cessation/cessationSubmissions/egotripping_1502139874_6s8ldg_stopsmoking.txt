Coping mechanisms while drinking

Hey /r/stopsmoking crew.  I'm trying again on attempt #97 (rough estimate), and like always, I'm struggling with smoking while drinking.  I quite on 7/30, and was mostly fine all week until Saturday night when a few friends came over to have a drink, and my will power faded after a few drinks and I bummed one.  It didn't even taste good, and I just felt guilty while smoking it.  

I know I'm not the only one to deal with this particular problem interaction.  What are your tricks to help get you a through a few drinks without smoking?

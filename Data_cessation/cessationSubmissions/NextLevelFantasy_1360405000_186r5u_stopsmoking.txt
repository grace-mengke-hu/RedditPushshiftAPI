Snowed in, about to smoke my last cigarette. Long time coming.

Quitting has been on my mind for a while now and I think it is officially time to make that move. One of the major reasons why it turned from a "hobby" to a habit was because of stress from an entrepreneurial venture, and the make or break point is on the horizon. 

So fuck it. The next week of waiting will be a painful one, but I am ready for a huge jump in quality of life in regards to my success and my health.

Here we go.

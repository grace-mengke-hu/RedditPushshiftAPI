NRT Technical question about gum.

I'm not sure if this is the place to post a technical NRT related question, so please forgive my ignorance if I'm in the wrong place. I scoured the internet for feedback, but can't find anyone to answer my Q. I just wanted to know if anyone who has used or is using NRT gum knows if I can take a used piece out after biting into it (gross) and then save it for later. This stuff is expensive and I would hate to spit it out after I get my nicotine fix, only to pick up another piece 20mins later... thanks

Lapses while Quitting?

I’ve been a long time lurker on this sub and finally decided to quit smoking Monday. I’ve messed up and had a total of two smokes this week. I feel defeated and mad at myself when I do smoke. Does anyone care to share their moments of lapsing while on the road to quitting? What’s your point of view on the matter?

Things to do instead of smoking cigarettes

Ive been cig free for nearly a day now, so Im still getting urges to smoke fairly often. Ive been watching GoT (around the middle of season 2 right now) and I gotta say its intense. Its been giving me cravings to smoke cigs several times an episode. Im doing good so far though. 

Thought I might ask what you former smokers ( who actually have been in this position) have found to be equally as satisfying as smoking a cig when you have a cig urge but dont smoke cigs anymore.

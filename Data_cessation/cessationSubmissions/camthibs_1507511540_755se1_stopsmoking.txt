Trying to quit before the real damage begins. 4 days no smoking.

So, a little background, I'm 21 years old. Have been smoking every day for the last 3 and a half years. Never got up to a full pack a day. I could usually go an average day smoking 3-5 cigarettes. At bars and at work, usually a bit more. I feel out of breath in the morning sometimes, low on energy pretty often. I know my teeth are yellowing. Other than that, no real side effects, yet. I know they'll come. I just made 4 days cigarette free. I haven't gone longer than a day since I started. I'm still fighting the voice in my head saying that one won't hurt. And the fact that I'm not a total "chain smoker" makes me feel like I'm not really doing any harm, even though in reality I am. Just hoping for some advice to help me push through this because I know it will pay off in the long run. Thanks everyone!

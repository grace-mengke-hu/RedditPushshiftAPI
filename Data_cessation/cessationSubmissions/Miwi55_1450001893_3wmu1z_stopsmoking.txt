365 days, after 40+ years, I am so happy and proud!

Today it is a year since I quit. It was so difficult at times, so easy at other times. Never will I have to feel guilty again for not stopping, fot I did it! 
For those still struggeling, you see it is even possible to stop after smoking a lifetime. Just go per day and do not look back! Good luck, you too can do it!!

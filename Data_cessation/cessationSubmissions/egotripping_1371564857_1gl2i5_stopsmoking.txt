Day 3 of first quit in a year. I really want to make this one last, but the anxiety is starting to get to me and I'm getting tired of coughing shit up.

After a raucous Saturday night, I woke up on Sunday and could hardly move.  My lungs were on fire and I couldn't even walk through my house without being winded.  Scary for anyone, especially a 25 year old guy who other than being a smoker for 8 years and a bit out of shape is in fairly decent health.  I made the decision right then to quit, and the last two days have been easy.

As always though, the third day is a real bear, and it's only 9am.  It didn't help that the last 2 nights I've been sleeping like shit, waking up every other hour in a sweat.  Adding in a sinus infection I think I'm developing is just making me irritable as hell and really wanting a cigarette.  

I will at least make it through today.  If you were in a similar situation during your quit, and you found something that helped you, would you please share it?  I've "quit" so many times and 9 times out of 10 don't make it past the 3rd day.

Thank you

So easy it doesn't even feel like I quit (vape)

25 year smoker.

I was out with my real estate agent looking at houses when he interested me in vaping. I'd tried vaping twice before with equipment and "juices" that looked and behaved like a regular "analog" cigarette. My fear was that I wouldn't like vaping simply because it wouldn't emulate smoking real cigarettes close enough to become a mental replacement.

It turns out the equipment and juices I had sampled were the biggest reason vaping never became satiating, let alone enjoyable.

I've been smoke-free for over a week and honest to god I can't believe how easy it was. Tried to smoke a regular cigarette from my preferred brand a few days ago and the taste was rancid.

I don't really have anything to offer. I just had to tell someone and not enough of my friends give a shit.

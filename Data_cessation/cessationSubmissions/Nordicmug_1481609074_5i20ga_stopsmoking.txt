I'm losing the battle...

I quit smoking over a month ago but I've had slips along the way.

Well my last slip has turned into a slide. I've been smoking again since last Saturday (Dec 3). I didn't smoke yesterday but today I got triggered by frustration and went a bought a pack.

I am going to keep trying but right now I just feel helpless. I need to find a way to hold onto a quit and I'm failing miserably. 

I don't know why I posted...I just needed to get it out I suppose.

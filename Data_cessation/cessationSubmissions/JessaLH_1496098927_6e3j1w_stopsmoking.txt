Amazed with myself.

Recently my mother was very sick and I had to deal with and do some things I never thought I'd have to do. It has been extremely hard and I wanted to smoke so bad I kept telling myself "if I smoke I'll stop crying and will be able to handle this situation better because I'll be calm" but I fought through it and the next day I was so thankful that I hadn't smoked and I still am. My brain was set on trying to convince me that smoking was the right thing to do. I feel very proud of myself for being this strong and I hope if the situation arises again I will be just as strong. 

It's shown me that I need to learn to work through negative emotions though. Wishing everyone luck on this journey and just want to say it's so worth it! So glad to be a non smoker.

Stay vigilant guys

This is my first Christmas as a non-smoker. I don't go in for a whole lot of stupid season that a lot of people do, but I make a bit of an effort when it comes to food.

I've just finished a very minor shop (like four items purchased). On the way home I had the drama thought that I had forgotten to stop at the smoke counter on the way out. Talked myself down from that.

Got home and carved up a watermelon and broke down a chicken. The reptile inside my brain whispered 'something, something - time for a smoke or something' WTF, reptile? 275 days since I did that shit!

In my early days of no-smoker status, someone on here told me that there will be episodes where it's the first time I did something since I quit and my brain will tell me stuff like 'Oh you carved the Christmas watermelon? Time for a smoke'. 

Crazy, but true. I'm on vigilante duty from now until after Australia day. Once January is finished, I think I'm out of the woods.

Stay vigilant. Let's not smoke together today.

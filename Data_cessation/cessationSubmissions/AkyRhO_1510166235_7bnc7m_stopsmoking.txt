6 months today

It's been six months already. I can't believe I made it this far so easily. I can't believe I did not quit earlier. 

Thanks everyone here on r/stopsmoking. I'm mostly a lurker but your posts help me everyday.

If you're at the very beginning of your quitting, hang on, it's getting better and better, I promise.

The 'i need this' cravings are gone... the 'I miss this' cravings are hitting hard

I'm just not the same without cigarettes. I don't know what it is but I can't be social right now. I can't do the things I would usually do... visit my family, go to a party on the weekends, focus on a movie/game. It's weird. I'm especially worried about football season and tailgating. I really don't know how I'm going to do it and not smoke cigarettes. 

I'm not going to let this deter me. The benefits are very clearly outweighing the urges but still, they're there, and it kinda sucks.

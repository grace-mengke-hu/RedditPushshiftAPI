Thoughts on my 5th day smoke free.

I was an 8 year, 2 pack a day smoker.  Today is my 5th day being smoke free.  I am doing it cold turkey with no patches or e cigs.  My first day was the worst.  I was sweating like crazy.  I could be standing in front of an AC unit and still sweat.  I would slap myself in the chest constantly reaching for my cigarettes in my front pocket that were no longer there.  The cravings were there but they were not as bad as I expected.

On day 2 I had a few drinks with friends.  This is when I had the biggest cravings.  I would stare at my friends pack of smokes and tell myself "just one won't hurt".  But luckily even though my friend smokes he told me no, that it will only set me back.  He is a pack a week social smoker btw.  

Day 3 I decided to clean out my car to keep myself distracted.  And to get rid of the smokey smell that I knew could be a trigger.  So in the process of cleaning I found a cigarette under my seat.  I held it in my hand and even gave it a smell.  But I told myself that I was not a smoker and crushed the cig.  

On Day 4 I went out with friends again for a few drinks.  But strangely enough I had no major cravings.  And on day 5 I have had no major cravings as well.  I still feel the need in my throat and chest but I am not letting it control me.  This morning I stood on my porch and took the biggest deep breathe I have taken in a long time and knew I can do this.  My advice to people quiting is to keep busy and keep reminding yourself that you are in control.  Not a stick of poison.  Thank you for reading this long rant post but I had to tell someone.

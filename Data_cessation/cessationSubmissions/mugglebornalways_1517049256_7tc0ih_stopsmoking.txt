Help/Support?! Day 3 after quitting cigs + starting vaping... I feel TERRIBLE!

Hey y’all, I’m new here, and could really use some advice!

27/f, been smoking since 16. Smoked 10-15 cigs a day for years... up until 3 days ago!

I have a vape now, and am using the 6mg nicotine juice to help. (Cold turkey didn’t work for me in the past)

I am having HORRIBLE withdrawals, even with the nicotine vape. I have IBS and anxiety already as it is, but since I stopped smoking, I can’t really use the bathroom as easily, my stomach is even more of a gassy gross lava lamp than it usually is, the nausea is insane, I’m starting to cough, my whole body aches, I’m having trouble sleeping, and I am *one. irritable. bitch.* right now.

When does this get easier? *Does* it get easier? Do any of you have any tips or tricks to help this go more smoothly? What can I expect in the coming days/weeks? Any advice is appreciated, because I’m miserable, but I’m committed to quitting!

Thanks in advance y’all!

(Introduction) I am addicted to nicotine.

By the title it kind of sounds like I'm introducing myself to an AA meeting or something, hahah.  Anyway -
Hi all, I'm Synthwavee.  I'm in my early twenties still, and have made the decision yet again to quit smoking.  I have attempted before, (vaping, snus, etc..) however this time I'm going to try just with the patch.  Only reason I'm honestly using them is because my girlfriend had a whole box that she's never used.  It goes down from I believe 21 mg/24hrs - to a lower amount.  I'm planning on just using them until their gone, directions followed as suggested, and then stopping cold turkey and parting from nicotine all together.  I actually didn't know that this sub existed! I was having a bad craving, did a search and found it.  I love the idea of the badges, etc.  Motivation from other people in the same boat as me will definitely help me on my journey from addiction.  Thanks guys for havin' me, I'll keep my quitting status updated here regularly.  I wish everyone else luck on their journey to quit.  

(Quit date: November 30, 2017)

over it im done.

I quit in may 2013. I was having many issues with smoking, it effected my sex drive, my lungs, and fuck just about everything. I quit in may. I smoked spilfs all summer while running swimming and being active, i didnt want the weed i wanted the tobacco and i knew that. 

Now fast forward to october i just bought a pack today, buying thinking to myself wow your such a fucking idiot, smoked 6 cigs today.. Fuck this i thought. took the 19 cigs i had left, threw them in the sink, fuck this shit. im over it my health is not worth this fucking gross taste in my mouth. iv quit for two years before and just recently 'quit' for 4 months. I will not smoke again.

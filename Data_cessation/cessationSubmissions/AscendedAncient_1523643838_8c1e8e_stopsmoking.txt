It took me being on the brink of death to quit smoking.

Just got out of spending a week in the hospital, went in Saturday morning, unable to breathe, and hadn't slept in 3 days.  Go in and they immediately admit me and check for everything.  Turns out my Asthma that I haven't had an issue with in over 20 years decided to resurface due to a common cold... and it nearly killed me.   Out of the hospital, and still on Oxygen, and taking prednisone.   

Please don't be like me and Don't be stubborn... Quit now while you can, not when you have no choice to.  Sorry for Rambling, just needing to get all this off my chest.  Still sitting here with a pack next to me, untouched for over a week and never going to be touched again, and in no way do I even desire another cig after going through what I did and am still going through.

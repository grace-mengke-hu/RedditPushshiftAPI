Quitting tonight [possible trigger post]

About an hour ago, I quit smoking.

I've been smoking since I was 16 years old. I love to smoke. Something about smoking is just so cool, relaxing and sexy. Sitting outside when I'm stressed out and smoking a cigarette with a drink is almost an ethereal experience and for some reason I've found it hard to quit until now. That's because cigarettes are bullshit.

I'm not one of those smokers who can have one cigarette at a bar. I can't just slowly draw myself down. I'm one of those smokers who has to have a pack and a half a day; I'm a chain smoker. I'm only 25 years old but I have the habits of someone who's abused for 50 years. My family can even discern my mood by how badly I wreak. It's disgusting.

I use it as an excuse not to workout (I rowed in college), as a reason to get out of things I don't feel and a variety of other stupid things. I'm done with this and with being an addict.

Little drags here and there

Hi so I quit smoking on the 17th of May but last night I drank a little too much and had a total of 10 drags (I counted) from my different smoker friends through out the night. Does that mean I need to change my quitting date? Does that even really count as smoking because I know many non-smokers who take few drags when they drink and they don't consider themselves smokers. It's not a big deal right? Please say no. I don't have any urge to smoke a cig sober.

Quit smoking Juul and I am dying. Please suggest ideas for mitigating withdrawal symptoms!

Okay, it has been about 7 days since I quit smoking the Juul (also quit alcohol but I didn't drink that much to begin with so it is not hitting too hard yet) and it has been a NIGHTMARE. I always had it on me and smoked while I worked, and I work from home so you already know I was hitting it hard, but this has made it so much harder to not have it this past week. Like I'm pretty sure I am in physical pain. My head has this heavy feeling that developed a few days back and today it is a full blown headache. I feel some discomfort in my stomach. My sleep is fucked. My body is tired.   


I need ideas to make this transition better! I am absolutely not going back to juuling, especially seeing how addicted I was, but I need help with mitigating the symptoms I am currently experiencing. I'm already drinking a ton of water. What do you guys do to ease withdrawal symptoms? Any special tips and tricks from your grandma? I would prefer all natural suggestions!!

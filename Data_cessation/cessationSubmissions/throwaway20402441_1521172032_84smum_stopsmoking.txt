Quit 2.5 months ago, but anxious and depressed all the time

Hey all, this is my first time on this sub. I just wanted to know if what I'm feeling right now is at all related to quitting smoking. I've tried several dozen times in the past, and I eventually successfully switched over to vaping a couple years ago. So I made a new year's resolution to quit altogether. I don't really have cravings for nicotine anymore, but I feel super sad all the time. I find it really hard to be happy for a long period.

However, I also recently made some HUGE changes in my life and I feel like it's spirally out of control. I broke up with my long term girlfriend 4-5 months ago and moved away from home/family/friends to pursue a graduate degree. I seemed to be doing fine emotionally up until I quit smoking 2.5 months ago. Then I started having panic attacks and would go through depressive episodes. I eventually stopped going to my classes and have decided that I can't handle the stress of grad school anymore and have decided to move back home. My life fucking sucks right now, and I don't know how much longer I can go on like this without giving in to nicotine, hoping that it will cure my mental ills. Has anyone else had these symptoms from quitting smoking?

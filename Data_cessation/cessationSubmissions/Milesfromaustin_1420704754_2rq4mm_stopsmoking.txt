Tried to quit a few times but THIS works. (so far)

Ok so to give a little past.  I have been drinking since I was 17 and smoking since 16. I am now 28. I've tried quitting with e-cigs and patches...  At the end of the day those are just ways you find to keep in taking nicotine..  After several wreck less drinking incidents to round out the year I figured I needed to dial it down.  So that's the past.  Here is how you quit cigs (and probably booze for a month as a bonus)   

Drink all day..  Receive the hangover you deserve.  Don't eat much food or drink water.  Try to activate "hair of the dog"  cure the next day and drink all day again.  Be smoking cigs this whole time,  as much as you can.  Get violently ill from over consumption,  you won't want to get out of bed and if you've achieved the correct level of hangover then you won't be able to use nicotine for a few days...  This is where you pound gallons of water and rehydrate.  Come to your senses a few days later...  Now that you are out of bed and slowly feeling better,  realize that you are already 2-3 days into quitting nicotine and booze and that you probably only have a few rough days ahead.  Grab water,  sunflower seeds,  regular gum,  lollipops,  stay busy.  Realize they are only cigarettes,  you've never almost died from not having a cig.  Your brain will play tricks on you,  but your brains a dick so don't give in.

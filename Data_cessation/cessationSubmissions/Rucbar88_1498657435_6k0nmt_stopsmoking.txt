Quit smoking tobacco, started vaping. Ultimate goal: quit smoking by the end of the year.

Hello fellow quitters,

I have been a smoker for more than 10 years now. I have always smoking tobacco. On average I used to smoke around 12 cigarettes per day. On bad days (I have chronic depression and OCD), I would go double. The next day I couldn't breathe but a cigarette was the first thing I would have cravings for. And the cough, oh the cough. My grandfather who was not smoking had  better coughs and he was 70 years old. 

Cause of my ongoing battle with obsessive thoughts, I decided I needed a positive diversion. So two days ago, instead of buying tobacco, I went to buy an e-cig. The seller was super helpful. I have started with 6mg. My goal is to keep 6mg for 2-3 months, then go for 3mg and then 0. I want to be done with smoking by the end of the year.

I have stopped smoking for about 48hours. I feels weird. But good. I have the craving to roll one after e.g. lunch. I have stopped coughing for no reason in the morning also. I can't wait to see other differences!!

So any stories to share? What should I expect health-wise the next days/weeks/months?

Thanks for listening!

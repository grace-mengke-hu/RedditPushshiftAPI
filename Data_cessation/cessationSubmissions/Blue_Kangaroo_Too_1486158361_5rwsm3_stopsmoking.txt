Quitting Tomorrow: The "Easy Way".

I have tried to quit smoking many times in the last 16 years, and managed to various extents. I am yet to have my LAST EVER smoke because I really have a hard time accepting the forever part.  

I have been reading Allen Carr's The Easy Way To Stop Smoking since yesterday and I like the way he advises looking at each withdrawal pang as a positive thing, a sign that yet more of that poisonous nicotine has left your body. I have had terrible issues with panic attacks and handling my emotions in the past which I'm really trying not to dwell on but it's been scary before, especially as I have kids that I don't want to snap at or be hyper-emotional around. 

But I really want to be free. I want to feel healthier and not tired and aching all the time. I can't afford this stupid addiction, health wise or money wise. I want to be confident in quitting once and for all - is it a case of fake it til you make it?

Wishing you all well on your journeys to freedom - any advice will be gratefully received ðŸ˜Š I plan on checking in here regularly as it has definitely helped me in the past.

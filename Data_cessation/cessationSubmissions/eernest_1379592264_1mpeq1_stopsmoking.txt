Tonight I go to the pharmacy and buy Champix

I want to quit for so long now. I think of it every day, every hour. Like many here, I've tried :


- **Allan Car book** : did not work, a buddy of mine gave me marijuana, therefore, I kept smoking :( - damn I hate me for writing this
- **Patches** : did nothing at all except crazy ass dreams
- **Gum** : kind of worked, but one gum made me miss one cigarette, no more. It was more expansive than buying cigs - damn all these excuses!
- **Cold turkey** : worked one day, a Sunday, I was at peace. Did nothing all day except watching Breaking Bad on the couch, kind of hibernation-mode, and being inactive like that is kind of the easy way, but next Monday BAM! - I hated myself once more
- After a relative died of cancer (not lung cancer) : worked three days. This experience was the most powerful : the death so near in my family made me realize I'll die too, I'm not a snowflake exception, and smoking is not known for its health benefits... so I quit. On day 3, I just wanted one cigarette before sleep... before you know it BAM you go back to it, it's a bitch, and you hate yourself. 

This shit is a trap.

Anyway, I just went to the doctor. I asked for a prescription for champix and some feedback about it. He didn't have any feedback to give, and he kind of scared me because he said "you will have trouble sleeping, and you will gain weight". He also told me it works better on man than woman (go figure).

So I've searched through this subreddit and found very positive feedback about this champix drug.

**Tonight, when leaving work, I go buy it.**

To keep me motivated, I'm subscribing here with my new account as well. Also, I asked for flair, the date is tomorrow.


Tomorrow I quit this motherf*cking drug that kills me slowly, gives me extraordinary bad breath, kills me slowly, takes all my money, kills me slowly, makes me caugh and slow at sports, kills me slowly, makes me miss family and work moments, kills me slowly. 

IT KILLS ME SLOWLY.

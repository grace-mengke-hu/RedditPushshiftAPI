So much good, so much bad.

I dont want to write a huge novel but I needed somewhere to write down how I'm feeling. I really need some support right now to make it out of this alive.

I was in an amazing relationship with an amazing girl. We were so happy, and a perfect fit for each other. We had dated for about a year and a half.

I had been smoking for around 8 years before I met her and she knew that, but quit shortly before we got together. I relapsed about 4 months ago and hid that from her, which was a huge mistake. She still has no idea I relapsed. We also regularly smoked weed together, which she was fine with.

11 days ago I quit cigarettes again and 9 days ago I quit smoking weed. I haven't touched either since. Our relationship kinda self destructed (I dont know if it has to do with smoking cessation and just the wrong combination of words) and im now single as of yesterday.

Since quitting cigarettes and weed, I am eating properly again, sleeping properly, im back in the gym on a program and gaining muscle again.

So much good is happening in my life but my heart feels so fucking empty.

Can anyone relate?

TLDR: I have made so many positive changes over the last two weeks but my once healthy relationship is no more. What the fuck.

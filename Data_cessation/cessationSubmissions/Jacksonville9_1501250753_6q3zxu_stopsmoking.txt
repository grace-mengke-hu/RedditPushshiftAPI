Today is the day!

After spending the majority of my life as a smoker, I have decided that today is the day to start my new life. I started around age 15 and I'll be 37 in a few months. It is finally time. I've only tried to quit once or twice and (other than 9 months or so that I was pregnant) the most successful I've been is a 45-day stretch. Here's hoping I can make this try stick. I'm scared and I'm angry, but I really don't want to lose this battle. I want to be the best me I can be and I can't do that with a cigarette in my hand. Wish me luck!

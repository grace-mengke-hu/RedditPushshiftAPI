Bad day todayâ€¦ but still not smoking!

I suppose this is my 1st real test of not smoking when being very stressed. But I did it! Nothing is going to make me go back now. I have almost 11 days under my belt and all that will happen is that number will keep increasing! Smoking won't change the way things are!

Two weeks!! :)

As I am typing this, it has been 15 days, 6 hours, and 37 minutes since my last cigarette on the morning of the 1st. I am feeling better and better every day, and my confidence is going through the roof! I only have one other friend who does **not** smoke, so I am constantly surrounded by it. 

My roommate and his gf both smoke, and pretty much everyone who comes to my apartment (usually 1-3 others a night) smokes, and through all of that, through the drinking and having fun with them, I have yet to light another one. I truly am proud of myself for making it this far while being completely surrounded by smoke. 

So, I guess to sum it up, I just wanted to say thank you once again for the help, tips, and support. You guys are great and coming here everyday keeps me going! :)

So stressed out I just want to cry

I'm on day 3.  I woke up this morning and felt so completely wonderful, proud, healthy.  Then I get to work and everything is just going up in flames.  I work as the Operations Manager of a very high-stress IT company, and today for some reason every client is having an issue, and every tech is acting like an incompetent ass.  The phone won't stop ringing, and every time it does, I feel my stomach drop and my pulse race.

I'm on the verge of tears and feel completely enraged.  I keep trying to breathe and remind myself that THIS is why I want to quit.  THIS isn't normal, I shouldn't feel this way.  I should be able to deal with my stress and not feel like running (literally, I feel like sprinting) to the corner store and chain smoking an entire pack.  I know this weakness isn't right, and I hate it. I just feel so overwhelmed.  I know for a lot of people the 3rd day is the worst, so how do you all get past it? How do you keep pushing on?

I'm trying positive thinking, reminding myself I don't want to be bullied (yeah, those stupid commercials worked on me haha), and trying to look towards how wonderful my future as a non-smoker will be, but I'm still getting these waves of cravings that make me sick to my stomach.

I won't lie, writing this post calmed me down a little bit.  Hope you all don't mind if I rage post every once in a while, and really, any advice you all have I'd really appreciate!

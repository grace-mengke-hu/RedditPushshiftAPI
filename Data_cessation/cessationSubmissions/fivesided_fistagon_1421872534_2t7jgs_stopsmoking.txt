A year plus

I won't say quitting is easy but it certainly is not impossible.  I can offer a few tips to help reach that one year mark. This may not apply to everyone so please just take it in the spirit it is offered, use what you can and forget about what you cannot use.

- Don't underestimate what it takes to successfully quit.  I think wishful thinking does no one any good.  You have to have a plan.  Face that quitting will be difficult.  However difficult it may be at least tell yourself that it is not impossible.  Just don't underestimate the power of addiction and get blindsided.  Be on your guard.

- I gained over 25 pounds over the last year since I quit. I am in the process of losing it now and have lost six pounds since January 1.  I tried to not freak out over weight gain and use weight gain as an excuse to start up again. 

- I found the Alan Carr book to be indispensable in helping set my mind straight.

- I stepped down from cigarettes to e-cigarettes. I believe it was key in helping me.  I see no problem doing that. I did however quit e-cigarettes two months after starting them. My one year anniversary is from all nicotine, not just cigarettes. 

- I felt the urge to smoke for about eight months after I quit.  It went away a little each day, like  few millimeters per day.  There were times when I told myself that smoking was not as bad as everyone makes it out to be.  That it was better to smoke and be happy then to quit and be miserable.  But each day is a new day and a little bit of the urge left each day until one day it was finally gone.  I think about smoking never now.  Be patient with this.  It does eventually get better. 

- Meditation was important to my success and I started this when I quit and still meditate every morning for at least 15-20 minutes.

- During the quit process I took little inventories of where I stood:    no coughing.. no phlegmy voice.. smelled much better.. increased libido... saving money.. not a slave to something anymore. It helped when I started to feel sorry for myself.  

- I got a chest X-ray showing a clean bill of health (no carcinomas or anomalies) and pulled that bad boy out to look at it a few times per week.  


Really everyone. please just remember that though the process may take time and though it may not be easy it is achievable.  They say success rates are relatively low.  It should not be. I think people give in too easily and start to think that smoking is not so bad compare to how they feel during the various stages of the quit process.  I can tell you I do not even think abut smoking anymore.  It was worth it.  Good luck.

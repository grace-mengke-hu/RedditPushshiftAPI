Sunday is the day

I've been on this sub for months, and been just reading thought post after post. I have decided enough is enough, been smoking since I was 16 and I am 32 now. Granted I usually am a pretty light 3-5 a day smoker only now, but this has to stop. Started reading Allen Carr's book, I stopped two years ago for nearly a year and was STUPID enough to have one. 
I see how much you guys support each other and I can't wait to join.

I broke the oven :(

I'm at 2 1/2 weeks. Sometimes I think "It feels so great to be a non-smoker! Cigarettes are so disgusting." Other times, I miss them but understand why I quit.
And sometimes, I am so fucking pissed! I have a bit of a temper as it is, but I blew up today and kicked the oven door, shattering it, because I spilled my tea :( 
Oops.
I'm telling everyone I dropped my mug after I spilled hot tea on myself, and it fell at a slight angle and hit the oven door. I just want to be honest with you guys so I don't take this secret to the grave.

(P.S- this was after punching the printer because it wouldn't work).

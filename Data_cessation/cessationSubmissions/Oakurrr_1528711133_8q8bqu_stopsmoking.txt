E-cigs as a quitting aid - Day 3 question

Heya - newbie here. I’m only 3 days into not smoking and I’ve been using an e-cig (18mg nicotine) to help. Not smoking it constantly but little drags spread out throughout the day. 

My question is how long should I spend at each amount of nicotine before decreasing? I was a smoker for 7 years, normally about 10-12 light cigarettes a day, but more if I’m drinking. 

Should I stay at 18mg for a week/month before going down to 12? I’m excited for this habit to be out of my life for good tbh.

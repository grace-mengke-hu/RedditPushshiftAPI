Hello All

I was referred here from /r/C25K.   I was planning on going the vape route to quitting, but after poking around on here for a bit...I'm going cold turkey.  

One of my closest friends came over for dinner tonight, and he, myself and my husband are sitting on the deck, shooting the shit and drinking a few beers.  

The occasion?  Me smoking the last of my **last** pack.  I am puffing the second to last one, now.  I will smoke the last, alone, before I turn in.  

I can do this.  I will do this.  I am looking forward to being free.

My parents go on vacation in a week and I'm afraid that I'll Start Smoking again.

Hi, I'm 18 years old and have been smoking for almost 2 years now, although until this summer it has been only a few cigarettes per week. However, since I've been on vacation in July I smoked several packs a week which only became worse when I started a new Job a month ago. As it's a really shitty Job and almost everybody smokes there I started smoking cigarettes in every break and on my way to work and home.
My Skin became horrible and I felt so bad because I've been hiding it from my gf (We are together for 3 months).
However, last wednsday night somebody on the radio talked about quitting and that you should do it when it is the hardest and I decided that this was the time. On thursday at 11am I smoked the last cigarette. Yesterday I was pretty bored as my gf and parents were both out of town and I almost relapsed, however I managed not to smoke.

Now I'm afraid because on saturday my parents go on vacation and with nobody at home I might want to have a cigarette. 
Any tips on how to avoid it? When my gf is at my Place I won't smoke anyway (bc. She doesn't know it) but because I start working at 5am we don't See each other very much.

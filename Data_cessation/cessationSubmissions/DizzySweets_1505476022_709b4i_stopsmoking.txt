Smoking is my most dangerous coping mechanism

I have previously quit for 18 months and felt great throughout that time, but when I started university to do a nursing degree I took up my evil little habit again. Felt like it was helping me to cope through the stress. I smoked all through my degree and for another year after but today I quit, again. 

I know I can do it, I've done it before but work and stress are going to make me feel like I need to smoke to stay calm under the pressures I deal with. It wont help. 

Hopefully this time my badge will keep going forever.

32 hours in...and I feel like such an idiot for everything.

You know that Bane quote about being born into something, not merely adopting it? That's how I feel about smoking. 

My mom smoked the whole time she was pregnant with me. She would brag about how the doctors warned her it was bad, but she proved them wrong.

My parents smoked in the house while I was a young asthmatic kid. My doctor told them it would be better to do it outside, but they didn't. I remember cold winter days when it was too chilly to crack a window in the car. They would basically hotbox me. But I was always warned to never smoke.

My mom died when I was 12 of heart problems. I used to have to sneak her in cigarettes in her hospital room. I thought I was helping. 

At 14 I had my first cigarette. I believed myself to have an immunity to nicotine, and early exposure made it to where I could take it or leave it. 

When I was 20, my dad died of lung cancer. Yeah.

And I am sitting here crying  because I want to smoke so bad.

I don't know if I am strong enough.

Way easier then expected!

Ok so I tried quitting 100+ times and always came back 1-14 days in cause I thought that the feeling of withdrawal was gonna last months. Well it wont, withdrawal was basically gone after 25-28 days. Did I want a smoke? Hell yes I did, but my body did not physically crave it. I just broke 100 days and I would still want a smoke but my body does not crave it, and when my body does not crave it I never think about smoking unless I see it in public or by friends. This is the key cause I can finally wake up in the morning and smoking does not even cross my mind. Good luck to anyone trying to quit this Summer and try to break 3 weeks, the physical urge to smoke will go away.

Need motivation.

Hey y'all I've started working near full-time for first time since after I quit smoking. I'm also 21 days sober from the cannabis and the last couple nights leaving work all I want to do is light up a blunt and get high. Since can't smoke the ganja anymore have been thinking about picking up a pack of cigarettes and lighting up. I know this is not what I want but in the moment the urges to smoke have been getting more and more intense. 

I would appreciate any and all advice/motivation y'all can provide to keep me from caving in to temptation.  

Thanks


Edit: Thanks again for all the support and suggestions. I did not respond to them individually but I read and thoroughly digested each comment mentally. I didn't have the urge to smoke today after work! Feels damn good. I think part of what made me lose the urge to smoke is the old woman that came inside and had to finish a 5-minute coughing spell before she bought a pack of cigarettes or the old man who came in to buy two cartons that could barely speak. I do not want to be one of those people. Also, holy fuck the number of people dropping $50-100 for carton(s) of cigarettes each week is fucking crazy. I like my money and work too damn hard for my money to throw it away. I will continue to fight the urge to smoke but if today is any indication I don't think the temptation will even exist. I stay subscribed to this sub for a reason and y'all have helped me out so much.  

Thanks again, stay strong you can do it. Live is too precious to cave in to temptation.

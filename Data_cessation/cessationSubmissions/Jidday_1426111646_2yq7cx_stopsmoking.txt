Odd occurrence since quitting

Hi all, I hope everyone is doing well. 

This might be a little strange... 

I am at 2 weeks smoke free and I have noticed every night since I quit that I wake up and need to pee at some point during the night and take a long time to get back to sleep. This rarely happened before unless I was drinking heavy. 

My lifestyle or sleeping times haven't changed. I thought maybe I am sleeping lighter for some reason and waking up a lot easier. I seem to be sleeping fine besides this oddity. 

Anyone have any ideas on this? Has anyone had trouble will deep sleep since quitting? 

All the best to you all :)

My father smokes like a train, ive tried but failed to make him stop.

My Dad has been smoking sense he was a preteen, and hes 54 now. Currently he has diabetes and stints in his heart with clogged artery issues and more things he wont tell me about. I've been begging him sense I was a child to quit, but he wont. 

My mother is a bit off, and by that I mean she needs to see a psychiatrist.  And a lot of the time it's really hard to be calm around her. She does everything she can for us, but shes crazy and lacks all common sense and its very infuriating to my father. Cigarettes and playing wow are his escape from the real world.  He goes through a few cartons a month.  More then a few actually. 

He did quit once for about 5 years and picked it back up.  I really feel that he thinks the cigarettes help him keep control of himself with my mom. I had tk take him to the hospital once because he felt like he was having a heart attack. Then the doctor was asking some questions after the pain went away, we got in the subject of my mom, and he got so angery just talking about how angery she makes him! Like, completely red faced blood rising shit. 

Then I knew he wasnt just smoking because he's addicted, he's smoking also because he uses it as a blanket from life. To calm down. he uses it like medicine.  What can I possibley do tk help him stop? I cant bare the thought anymore of losing my dad, it's becoming more and more real. He works really hard at his job, he smokes, and eats unhealthy cause my mom cant cook, on top of all those health issues.  Please, any advice is welcome. How can I possibley get through to him? What can I say to him to even make him consider quiting? 

Td;lr - can't make my dad stop smoking, any advice is welcome.

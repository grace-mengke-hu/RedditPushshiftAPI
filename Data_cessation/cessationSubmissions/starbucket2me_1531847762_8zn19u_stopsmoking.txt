Day 8 (cold turkey)

Hello!! I decided for my 27th birthday to finally quit smoking cigarettes after smoking about a pack a day for the past 13 years. I have never tried to quit before, but it was something I had been thinking about for a few months and am going for it! I am currently on day 8 and was hoping I could get some input on what to expect. I'm still definitely experiencing  cravings and keep finding myself involuntarily eating a lot. While I am feeling less hostile than I initially was, I still feel much more emotional and vulnerable than usual. How long should I expect to experience the negative withdrawal effects? Also, i was wondering if there were any cool benefits of quitting smoking that are lesser known to help with motivation! Thanks :)

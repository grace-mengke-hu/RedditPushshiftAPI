WTF just happend?

After weeks of planning I quit smoking on Sunday. I was prepared perfectly. I read a lot in this subreddit and when the day came I felt no fear. then the first days passed and gues what? It felt so fucking easy! Whenever I had cravings I just made up my mind, recalled why it's better not to smoke and when my mindset was straight I knew smoking was not an option. One thing that was important for me was the fact that I do it on my own, not telling anyone. Well also not denying it, just letting the information of me being a non-smoker spread naturally: GF, Collegues, Near family --> the less I see them the later they would notice. 

Today was the second time since monday that someone adviced me to stop smoking. Not in a demanding but very loving manner. For me it felt like sabotage to my perfect plan: I quit and all of a sudden people come and tell me it would be good to quit. I know it is irrational, since my plan works and is basically untouched.

What then happend is as follows: I cried! A 28 year old man going to his bed crying! WTF? I have no idea how such a minor incident could screw me so hard even after it felt so easy until now. Right now I am good again.

Has someone experienced something like this? I'm not talking about feeling miserable, but ten minutes of solid crying for nearly no reason.

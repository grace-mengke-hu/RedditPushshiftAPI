Day 0 but feeling positive!

I've only been smoking for two years but am now a pack a day or more smoker. It suuuuper sucks because I constantly stink and my fitness level is terrible for someone who isn't even 20. The main reason is that I hate being tied down to this addiction. Quitting cold turkey TODAY - Monday the 20th of June 2016.

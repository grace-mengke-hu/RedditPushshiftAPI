Smoked for 20+ years - today is quit Day 1

I'm a 40 year old dad of a young son and embarrassed now to be a smoker. Embarrassed to smell like it at work or take breaks, embarrassed that my wife and I spend upwards of $500 / month on cigarettes when we have other expenses, and especially embarrassed that I have continued to put my health at risk even though I have people who rely on me. 

I am going on a business trip overnight from Thursday to Friday. Typically this means 10-12 hours in a room with people I don't know that well and not smoking at all, all day long. I'm sort of nervous about what my mental state will be then but hoping that getting my first three days done first will make it easier. In my last attempt many years ago I actually found every day to be a little easier than the last.

I was tempted to put my quit day off until after this trip, but deep down I know there are NO stress free weeks and there will always be an excuse to delay it. 

I'm sitting here at work Day 1 now with clammy hands and feeling exhausted. I just try to keep in mind the benefits in $, health and not being a slave to a drug. 

Not asking for advice or anything, just getting this into writing for my own benefit. I wish you all luck in your efforts.

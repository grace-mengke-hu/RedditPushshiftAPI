Quitters of Reddit, what are your point of view with vaping / electronic cigarettes?

About 2 months ago I've been told by the doctor that I have severe asthma and need to quit after 20 years of smoking. Best I could (till now) was to switch to vaping, which lessened my complains related with asthma. Still, I feel envious seeing you people just have quit it, and wonder how much I may consider myself one of you.

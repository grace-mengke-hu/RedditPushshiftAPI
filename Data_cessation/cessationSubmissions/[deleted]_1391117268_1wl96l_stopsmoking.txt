Getting drunker after quitting. Anyone else?

So, It's my second time to quit. I quit for 3 months last year and slowly got pulled back into it. This exact same thing happened last year when I quit. 

I get black the fuck out drunk when I'm not smoking. I'm not drinking more, infact, I'm drinking less and still getting more drunk. I originally thought it was because I wasn't taking cigarette breaks while at the bar while drinking with friends so I was of course drinking more because there were no breaks. But For the last couple weeks I've been counting my number of drinks and I'm not drinking anymore than I normally would, I'm typically drinking less. 

Anyone else running into this problem? Any reason you know of why this happens?

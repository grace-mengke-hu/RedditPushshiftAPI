First evening spent with a smoker since my quit.

Day 25 for me and spent the evening with a smoker. Wow was that tough. Would have been so easy for me to have one and I really wanted to - felt weak for even thinking about it. But I didnâ€™t. It has gotten much easier since day one so I think focusing on how much better this will be in the next 25 days is how I got through this evening.

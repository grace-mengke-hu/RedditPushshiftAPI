My last and final quit!

I have quit a total of 3 times.


The first time was for 8 months, the second time was 3 days, and this last one is my final one!

It's been a lot easier to go cold turkey and without substituting the habit after reading Allen Carr's book. I actually feel like I'm a non-smoker.

Just wanted to make it public so I can keep myself accountable. Good luck to everyone else out there and I seriously recommend reading Allen Carr's book if you're having trouble smoking.

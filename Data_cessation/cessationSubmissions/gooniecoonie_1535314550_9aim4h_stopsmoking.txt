Will driving always feel so sad now?

Ugh I am now 8 days in using Alan Carr and it’s going ok.

No crazy cravings...I get maybe 60+ urges throughout the day where my mind quickly, almost subconsciously wants to light up: it passes quickly. BUT DRIVING me and my husband used to love going for long drives, we would sing along to songs, pretty much chain smoke and just have a great time. We would drive hours just for fun, talking, singing and enjoying the beautiful scenery that is in our area...but now I can hardly listen to music in the car without thinking of smoking...I feel nauseous when driving, no singing, just wishing I could smoke...but not really....just totally feeling bored and like I want to get out of the car: will this ever go away?! Will I ever enjoy my car rides again? Did I only love it because it make me feel like I had an excuse to chain smoke? I feel like an emotional mess over such a trivial thing

Tell me this gets better and I won’t always have these stupid cravings and empty lonely feelings

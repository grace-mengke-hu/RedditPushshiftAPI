The Battle Has Begun Again

Today would have been 287 days. First I posted 3 weeks ago that I smoked while drinking. Then I posted last week when I bought (and threw away) a pack. Now I'm posting to say that I'm a smoker again. Sunday is the new quit date. I can't believe I fell down that fast. :( Can't stop fighting. Protect your quit folks. There is no "just one." There is no "social smoking." Thought I had learned that lesson enough times but apparently I was due for a refresher.

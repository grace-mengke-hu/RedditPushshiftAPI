Can anyone throw me some good vibes?

Sitting here at work and I'm preparing to leave in a few hours. Can anyone throw me some encouragement? I have stopped a few times in the past, with my longest streak running probably 6 months. I started at 21, and am now 26. I get into the habit of buying a pack, smoking 5 or 6, and then throwing them away determined to stop. I'll make it a day or two before inevitably buying another pack.

I think I can make it this time. I just need to get home tonight without stopping at a gas station or something. Anyone else buy packs, only to throw them away, and then buy some more? Insanity.

Success Stories Thread!

Hi all!  I think it'd be great for those (like myself) struggling to quit to hear from those of you who've succeeded.  I'd love to hear anything you have to share, like:

What motivated you to quit?  What kept you motivated when it was hard?  What were your biggest fears about quitting, and were they real?  And really, any big or little things you did that made it easier.

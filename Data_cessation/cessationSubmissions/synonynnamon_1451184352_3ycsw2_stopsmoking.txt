QUIT: Day 20 and an Early, Easy New Year's Resolution

Hello, /r/stopsmoking/! 

When I first posted 2 weeks ago, I was restless, cross, and constantly felt like there was a steering wheel lock compressing my head's every nerve.

Now? I'm feeling better and better everyday. In just 27 hours, it will have been 3 weeks!

In some way, my ambition to quit on the 7th of December was partially fueled by a desire to start the New Year off already quit and free from the stresses of withdrawal, rather than anxiously waiting around to unload the burden on poor New Year's Day and the bitter month of January.

I tried just that at the start of 2014. It was going to be THE year. 6 days in, I resorted to old habits and felt that the entire year was ruined as a result. 

Coming into another Year: You cannot force your future self to behave differently unless you can change how you act in the present first!

Best of luck to all of you! Don't give up! 

A belated Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!

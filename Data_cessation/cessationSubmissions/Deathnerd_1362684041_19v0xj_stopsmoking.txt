Tips for helping a friend stop tobacco?

My best friend dips (snus) and smokes. She says she only does it when she's stressed, but I have a feeling she uses her stress as an excuse. She won't use them around me because I've expressed to her how genuinely it upsets me. 

I've lost 3 grandparents to smoking and I'm about to lose my 4th. I don't want to lose my best friend to tobacco either. I just don't see how I can get it through to her how bad it is. 

Her ex-fianc√© got her started on snus (bastard) and her mother dips. I can see how her mother dipping would subconsciously reinforce the habit. She's told me she wants to stop because she doesn't want to end up like her mother, but she doesn't. 

She's one of the strongest willed people I've ever met, but this seems to be bigger than her. I'm afraid to bring it up because she'll get super pissed and (in my opinion) overreact to my concerns. She passes it off by saying "I won't get addicted Deathnerd. I promise" but I know it's a lie. It feels like I'm the only one who cares. Her boyfriend doesn't seem to mind, and neither does her family.

So my question is this: what can I do, as a friend, to help her quit? Is it possible to put it gently or will I have to get confrontational about it? I'm tempted to throw the tobacco away when I see it, but I don't feel like that would be a wise choice. 

Thanks guys (and gals)

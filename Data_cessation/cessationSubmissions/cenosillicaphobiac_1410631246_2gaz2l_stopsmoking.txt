A distinction

I was having a conversation the other night with a friend who really wants her husband to quit.  She said that he has said a lot that he really wants to quit, but maybe he's just saying that because she wants it.

This helped me clarify my own thoughts on the matter, and this is what I explained to her:

For over 20 years I "wanted to quit' and when I told people that I wanted to quit I wasn't lying, I wasn't making something up, I wasn't just telling them what they wanted to hear.  In fact, over those years I tried to quit, dozens, maybe even hundreds of times, to no avail.  

The change came when instead of "wanting to quit" I "didn't want to ever smoke a single cigarette again".  It may simply be word choice, but to me, it represents an entirely different mindset.  Wanting to quit is vague, and undefined, and seems so tough.  Never smoking another cigarette defines it more precisely, says how you're going to quit, and puts a more definite spin on it.

Now, I did a few times have to back off of that and just break it down into "I'm not going to smoke until I wake up tomorrow" and "I'm not going to smoke today, and we'll see what tomorrow brings" and "It's Thursday, I've already not smoked for 8 days, I'll look at it again in 3 days" and other tricks of that nature, but the mindset was a complete change.

How long will this post-quitting cough last?

I quit smoking cigarettes last November and still have this bothersome cough. Initially, I attributed it to not smoking: cilia growing back, lung tissue very tender, and so forth. But it's been over three months and it hasn't gotten any better; if anything, it seems to be getting slightly worse. 

Possible explanations could include: 
a) lungs still tender, cilia still growing back, and so on (be patient!); 
b) I've been going to the gym regularly and like to work hard when I'm there, so perhaps aerobic exercise is irritating my slowly-repairing lungs (although I went through a several-month stint of exercise about 16 months ago and didn't notice it impacting my lungs this way at that time); 
c) infection (colds, flu going around and my lungs are probably still fairly susceptible).

Anyway, I wanted to get some anecdotal experience/advice before I get frustrated with this cough and go see a doctor or change my exercise routine - I don't really want to do either unless necessary. And for comparative purposes, I was a light/moderate smoker (on average 3-5 cigarettes a day) for six years. I checked past posts and didn't quite find the information I was looking for, but I apologize if I overlooked something.

Thanks for your help and input!

Edit: It appears to be unanimous that any cough I may have is unlikely due to my previous smoking habits. This is  exactly what I was hoping to learn, so thank you all for your help. Looks like I'll be making an appointment soon!

Very first day.

Hello Reddit, today is my first day to stop smoking. In just under a month I will be 21. I have been smoking since I was 14 years old. I have tried to quit so many times, and all have been in vain. My last attempt I had actually quit for a month, then relapsed with that mentality of 'Oh, I can have just one.' I need support. As much support as I can get. I need to kick this filthy disgusting habit before it leads to my demise.

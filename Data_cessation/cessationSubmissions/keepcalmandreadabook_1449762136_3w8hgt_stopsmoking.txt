How many "cigarettes a day" do you guys submit on your quit-smoking-tracking apps? The most you did a day? The least? The average?

I would smoke a pack a day at most, but there were a few times I smoked a pack and a half.

The least I would smoke as a smoker were days I had work, which was about 10 cigarettes. 

The average, then, would be about 15 ciggs a day. Should I put that?

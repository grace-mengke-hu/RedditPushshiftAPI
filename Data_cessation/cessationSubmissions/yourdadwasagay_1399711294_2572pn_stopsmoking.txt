I just lit a cigarette and then put it out almost immediately. The time is right now.

I've been lurking here for a hot damn minute. I've tried to quit approximately three million times, kind of, but didn't *really* want to stop. The longest I made it was three days, last year.

Been smoking 4 years now. I used to run about 10 miles a day, and then I stopped. I went for a run the other day for the first time in at least a couple years, and didn't even make it half a mile before I stopped and hacked and hacked and hacked. My skin is a mess. I've noticed more and more lately that I can't smell things that my roommate can smell. That's a little alarming.

Man I'm fucking sick of it all. At this point every time I'm about to smoke, I *actually think* "This will not make me feel better." And then I light up anyway, and indeed, feel worse not better. Ooooover it! And I know I'll want to kill everyone for at least a few days or whatever, but while I won't actually kill anyone during not smoking at least I won't be killing myself. The time is nigh. Wish me luck.

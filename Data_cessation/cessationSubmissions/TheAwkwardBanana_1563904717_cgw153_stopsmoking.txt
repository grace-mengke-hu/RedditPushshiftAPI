Day 13...

Still going strong. This is fucking sweet, I can live my life without having to be pulled away from various activities I was doing at the time to stop and use nicotine... Not anymore! Still having cravings but nothing that isn't manageable. 

I'm gaining **my control** back over **my life** one day at a time.

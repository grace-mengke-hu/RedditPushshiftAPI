Trying again, attempt 100 ish

I quit once for 9 months, not pregnant, just coincidence.  Then I quit for one month here and there.  I'm currently at 25 days, 26 in about 10.5 hours.  I'm using nicotine lozenges.  I tried cold turkey so many times, but I have a very stressful life and death job, and anxiety... So, I figure the lozenges are a good compromise for now.  

I feel good about it.  I have moments of wanting to smoke, but on a weird level.  I miss it, but I don't really want it.  It's just been a part of me for 26 years.  It felt like comfort, even though scientifically I know it's not comfort at all.  Trickery.

I'm having some pretty serious insomnia, but managing to keep my weight stable.  Previously, I gained weight fast when I quit.  I'm feeling strong, committed.  I'm enjoying the money I'm saving, and my house smells awesome.  Smokers smell terrible when I am near them in public.  

Just dropping this here bc I can't sleep, again.  I hope that sorts out soon bc I'm feeling the effects of lack of sleep.

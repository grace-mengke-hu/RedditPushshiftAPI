Check In: Day 1 (Again)

34 days, no Tookies. Binged in a random park. After that, 6 days, no Tookies. Binged again tonight in the stairwell of my apartment building. Feel like a Damn Fool. I got the Stop Smoking App. Ima check in here quite often and maybe that will help, too. Let's all keep not smoking and get less unhealthy together. Max love.

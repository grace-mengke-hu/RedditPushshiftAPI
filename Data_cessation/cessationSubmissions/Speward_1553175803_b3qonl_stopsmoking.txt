Giving it a shot

I know smoking is horrible for my health but how I do love it so....or at least my brain tells me that every hour.  I've decided that it's finally time to break myself of the addiction/habit.  Started Chantix about a week ago.  Very surprised by how well it reduces the cravings.  First week I went from 1 pack a day down to about 8 cigs a day.  This week, while I'm technically not supposed to be smoking, I'm down to about 3 smokes a day.  I think that by the weekend I'll be able to finally go a full day.    

The hardest thing for me is the routine; having one when letting the dogs out in the morning.  One with coffee.  One or two on the way to work.  One after each meeting.  On the way home, coffee, dogs, bed.  But I'm slowly breaking each with each passing day.  

Wish me luck!

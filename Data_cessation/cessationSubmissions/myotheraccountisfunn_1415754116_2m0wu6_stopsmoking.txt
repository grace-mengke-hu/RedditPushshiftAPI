Â£7 saved a 44 roll-ups not smoked, WOO!

God, it's been really freaking tough, but I just feel so god damn pumped, I started Couch to 5k, dieting and quitting smoking (not on the same day but hey) I can't wait to see how much better of a person I am going to be now that I've made these changes. Keep on Truckin' guys, we can do this!

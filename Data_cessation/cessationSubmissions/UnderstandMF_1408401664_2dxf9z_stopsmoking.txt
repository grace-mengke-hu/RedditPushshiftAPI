I haven't smoked for nearly 3 years - but I miss smoking

I haven't had a cigarette since October 2011, after 6 years of addiction to nicotine and around ~10 attempts to quit under my belt. But I feel like I'm still addicted everyday. I feel really guilty to say this, but everyday I want to smoke a cigarette because I miss it so much. How can I get rid of this feeling? Please help me /r/stopsmoking ;-;

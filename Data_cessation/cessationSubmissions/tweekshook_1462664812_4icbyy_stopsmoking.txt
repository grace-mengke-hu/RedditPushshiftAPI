I'm over a year!

I don't know how many days (until after I post), but I remember it was late March or early April last year. Some of you folks may not count it, but after 2 months I started vaping, but weened myself down to zero nic over a couple months. I do still vape out of habit, but no nicotine cravings. I love smelling things, and only not being able to breathe after 3 flights of stairs because I'm fat, not because of the cigarettes. I've stayed a lurker on the sub, but always chilled in the background being proud of myself and everyone else.

It can be done everyone, just keep at it, and ask for help from your friends!

Just smoked my first cigarette in 7 months...

And you know what? I'm not even mad. 

I was at first. I was pissed at myself as I was smoking it. The entire time I was asking myself "why am I doing this?" But I did it anyway.

But 10 minutes later here I am, alive, still breathing, and more committed than ever to quit for good. The single cigarette that I just smoked reminded my of every reason I decided to quit in the first place. The nasty smell, the disgusting ashy taste in your mouth, the gunky feeling on your teeth, the congestion in your chest afterwards...

Perhaps I NEEDED this cigarette to help me reach my goal of a healthy, happy, smoke-free life. I needed that reminder that smoking is no good and in fact actually quite stupid. It does nothing for you except make you spend your own money to slowly kill yourself. 

I guess the point of this post is to remind you not to beat yourself up if you mess up. It's okay, and it happens to even the best of us. Don't let it ruin all the hard work you've put in to distancing yourself from this disgusting habit. Use it as a reminder for why you started in the first place! 

Best of luck guys, we're all in this together. You can do it!

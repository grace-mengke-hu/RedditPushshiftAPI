So my bank account was hacked, $1500 was stolen. But I still didn't smoke!!

I was sitting at my desk yesterday and got an email receipt for a $1500 RC Drone. Ummm...I didn't order that. I spent the next couple of hours on the phone with paypal and my bank. My heart was racing, hands shaking, mom's spaghetti etc. I wanted that relief so bad. I never expected something this stressful to happen on day 2. But I pushed through. 

So my bank account is still overdrawn and I'm still pretty stressed about it. But I'm not going to make it worse by buying a $6 pack of smokes!

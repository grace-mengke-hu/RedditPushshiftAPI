23 days without smoking, feeling very depressed and upset all the time

Quit smoking 23 days ago. For the first 2 weeks I used both the patch and nicotine tabs/gum. For the last two weeks I've only used the tabs and really try to limit the number I have per day (never more than 10).
But for the last week or so I've been feeling depressed on the verge of crying, have no patience, feel frustrated and almost angry all the time. 
Anyone have experience with this? Is it the NRTs causing this? Am I not getting "enough" nicotine? Would it help skipping NRT completely ?

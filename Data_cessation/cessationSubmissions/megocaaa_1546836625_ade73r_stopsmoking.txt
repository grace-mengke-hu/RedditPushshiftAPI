Ex-smoker snacking. It’s come to my attention I’m falling into a classic trap, and crave that oral fixation. I’ll make sure it’s healthy, but if I’m watching Netflix on the couch there is something in my mouth. And I smoke weed which does not help. I don’t like water. I drink a lot of la croix. Gah

Trying to quit Juuling, 26 hours!

Hey guys, I know it's not smoking per se, but I got addicted to juuling. I've been going through a pod a day and it's starting to become too much money and I feel my blood pressure increasing over time. On top of that I seem to get too high blood sugar, when before I didn't. 

Because of this I decided 26 hours ago to quit. It's been pretty rough so far and I was wondering if you guys have any tips. I suffer from anxiety and depression (which is why I started juuling, self medication). It's been quite a bit heightened so far. Also I've gotten a few really strong cravings that almost made me budge. 

I've been reading a lot of articles, and apparently the worse is 3 days in. What should I expect on the 3rd day? It falls right on a Monday so that's gonna suck, because I'm used to juuling during my lunch break.

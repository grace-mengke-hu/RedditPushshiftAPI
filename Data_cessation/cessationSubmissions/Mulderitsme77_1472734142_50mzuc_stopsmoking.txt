2nd day, woke up ragey!

Hey all!
  Yesterday was my first day off of cigs, and I was just fine. Pleasant, even. Today, I woke up feeling on edge and ragey, like I'd just spent a few hours pent up in a box with my ex-husband. It's unpleasant! Just wondering if any of you all have felt like you're going to Hulk the F out on people around you, and how you managed it. This is not like me! Thank you!!!

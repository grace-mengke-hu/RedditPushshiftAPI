Day 5 of using my vape. Going well!

I have had a shit week. 

Last Monday I found out my grandpa was going to die in the next few days. That day was supposed to be my quit day, but I broke and bought a pack. I smoked most of them within a day, but I threw away the rest at the request of my fianc√©e. 

Wednesday he died. That was the last day I smoked. 

Yesterday was his funeral. I wanted a cigarette so bad, but this whole week I've been able to use my vape and not give in to temptation. 

I'm proud of myself. I'm on 6mg on nicotine right now, and next I will transition to 3mg, then 0mg. Then I quit!

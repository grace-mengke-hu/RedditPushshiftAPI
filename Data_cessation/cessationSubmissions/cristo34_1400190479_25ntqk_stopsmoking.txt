The first and second 72 hours

It's been a tough three days, totally depressed, brain fog, couldn't make a decision to save my life and no motivation.  I had to drag myself out of bed after twelve hours of sleep but it's getting better.  I've been a closet smoker and decided I'd had enough.  Ten days ago I read allen carr's book, I managed to make it 5 days, it was brutal.  Then I had wine this past Sunday night and I bought a pack of cigarettes.  I smoked two and threw the rest away justifying that it was only a little bit.  Of course now after reading John Polito's Freedom from Nicotine I realize there is no such thing.  I totally reset my addiction and was right back to square one.  Whether it be one puff, a pack or a carton, it doesn't matter.  So the past three days were hell, but it really helped knowing it's that way for many people, that the worst would be over soon and I really wanted to be nicotine free.  Finally, today, into my fourth day I can say it's getting better.  I feel a bit better mentally.  I'm a bit more motivated and I have hope it will just keep getting better.  I don't ever want to live another three days like the ones I just had, it's clear nicotine had a death grip on me  but I couldn't feel it until I stopped.

Had two cigarettes last night after two glasses of wine.  They did nothing for me.  6 days smoking in the last 80 I know I can kick this habit for good, going to focus on 30 days and take it one day at a time.

July 26, 2014 - Rebirthday
Two and half cigs last night and wine and a couple of beers.  It was 8 years since my surgery rebirthday and it's time to be done with this habit.  30 days and the rest of my life starts today.

Same pattern, depressed, drinking alone, smoked.  I gotta stop the drinking alone and also looking at notes about how crappy I feel when I relapse.  Starting on day 1 again.

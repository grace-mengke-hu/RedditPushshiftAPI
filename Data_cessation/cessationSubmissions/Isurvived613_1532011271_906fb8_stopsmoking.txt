Relapse after just 14 hours....

Hey all, first post here. 

Context: I don't smoke cigs on their own. I put tobacco in my bong then put weed on top (its legal where I live so I dont want to chat about that). 

I'm trying to quit both because cost, reasons to live, etc. Problem is that I don't want to stop. I want the good feeling of living "my best life" but everytime I start thinking about that I get crippled by my anxiety (diagnosed + on meds) and start to panic pack a bong with tobacco/weed. 

I tried putting on a patch yesterday and threw out all my tobacco but there is still weed in the house because my wife smokes it recreationally. 

I need some words of wisdom. I just wasted 3 hours standing at the window staring at a single cigarette I bummed from a neighbour and my weed tin. Finally caved, covered in sweat and regret now. 

How do I beat this. I know the cigs are the reason I crave bongs. But the combo is bankrupting me. I cant see myself quitting tobacco without having the crutch of weed to lean on but obviously its just a tether to my tobacco. 

How did you successful quitters get through this thought process. I want to quit, but not quiting feels way better. Until I think of the reasons I want to quit, then I feel like a P.O.S. get an anxiety attack and turn to my bong (tobacco and weed). 

HOW DO I BREAK THIS CYCLE!!?!?!

I've set myself a date: 3 weeks no smoking. I don't see a reason why I should continue this.

I have never been a heavy smoker. I've smoked around one daily but no more than four (and sometimes none). But one day I was curious if it was possible for me to keep myself from smoking for 3 weeks.

And so 23 days have passed since I last smoked a cigarette. This definitely is the longest I've gone without smoking in almost two years. And although I have a mind to immediately go out and buy myself a pack of cigarettes, I feel the addiction wearing off and I feel very hesitant to do so (and rightfully so).

I mostly need to vent because my non-smoker friends are annoyed at how often I speak of wanting to smoke and their response is always: "just don't" which really irritates me (I'm easily annoyed these days). I guess I'm looking for any reason to completely stop smoking (Just don't say cancer because I am aware, and yet that seemed to have not stopped me for the past two years)

Acne

I’ve quit smoking now for just over a month. I’ve gotten to the point where I’m always hungry now and trying to control my appetite with drinking water while also being able to taste food more so than before. One symptom Ive been experiencing for the past week or so is acne. Ive always had small breakouts and clogged pores but nothing too bad or noticeable. Lately it’s been getting pretty bad though. I have several problem areas at one time while also having bumps all over my face. Is this a normal symptom when quitting and if so how long should I roughly expect this to last? Thanks in advance. Also while I’m here and posting I’m low key wondering how long it’ll take until I notice a difference in the “glow” of my skin type deal.

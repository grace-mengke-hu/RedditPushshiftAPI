Made it a month so far

This is surreal to me, really.  
Want thank everyone here for being a part of my quitting.   I like reading peoples stuff n relating.  Seeing regulars.  Helping others. Getting help.  Sharing positivity.  Yelling at negative people.  And a lot of killin time here cuz I cant sleep sometimes.
anyways thanks n good luck see yall around.

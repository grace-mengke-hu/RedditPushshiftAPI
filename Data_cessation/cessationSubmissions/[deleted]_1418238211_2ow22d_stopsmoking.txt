It's time

I started to smoke when I was 15. Shortly after that I began to take Opiates and became highly addicted to both. I am now clean of Opiates for 1 year 9 months. It was very hard to quit but once I made a definitive stance on quitting I became highly motivated. I could see first hand how Opiates changed me mentally and physically. The short term effects were there. From me losing weight, money, friends, motivation and my morals. I could see how my life was being thrashed around from this drug. It gave me a huger to get better. To change. To become the person I was, to find the better part of me that was lost. It drove me and made it a lot easier to quit.

Now my battle with addiction has resurfaced as I realized that cigarettes are my new enemy. In this time of clarity I know that life isn't forever and that Cigarettes will dramatically decreased mine. 
I find it hard though to find that same motivation as I did before. I don't see short term effects on me as I did with Opiates. Maybe I smell like smoke or my teeth discolor but nothing that really bothers me. It's the long term effects that'll get you. Years off your life you won't get back.
It's a different struggle trying to quit cigs. I can't escape then like I did with opiates by removing myself from they're presence. They are everywhere! I will always see them, smell them or even be offered a cig. The temptations are unreal. And the fact that they are legal makes it seem less wrong to smoke. It's accepted in society unlike Opiates. 
I will have to find new strength in myself to overcome this addiction. I will strive for my future and not just for the now. I will break these habits. I will become I non-smoker!

Half a year!

I don't even remember smoking. Crazy, right? The smell of an outdoor ashtray actually sickens me sometimes and I feel genuine pity for those I see huddled outside, trapped in addiction. I used to be one of those people who rush outside at the airport for a smoke, but now I just saunter down and grab a taxi unless it smells like smoke. This is what life is supposed to be like. Thank you r/stopsmoking!

Yesterday was my last nicotine patch. 1 month and 22 days no cigarettes.

I had previously quit for about 2 and a half months, but lost steam and took a few "just one drag"s and had a pretty awful car accident, leading me to say fuck it and picking up my half a pack a day habit. Last day of finals I slapped on a patch and quit again. Haven't had a cigarette in almost two months and STILL DON'T WANT ONE. I'm finally having my nicotine withdrawal and I can't see straight. 

The second time around is much easier for me. I simply don't want to smoke. It's a part of the past. I'd much rather be able to breath, taste, smell, have cash, have good sex, white teeth, than have the momentary satisfaction of a drug that will kill you.

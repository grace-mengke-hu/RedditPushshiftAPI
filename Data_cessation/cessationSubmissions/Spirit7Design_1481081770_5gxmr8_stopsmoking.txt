Went to a bar tonight.

So I went to a townie bar tonight where they still allow smoking indoors, and of course the place was a cloud of cigarette smoke. It smelled horrible the entire time I was there and I had to take a shower as soon as I got home because the lingering smell was so offensive to me.

Prior to this, the idea that I should have just one had been creeping into my brain.  That is definitely not the case anymore, so I've got that going for me. 

I never thought I would make it 155 days!

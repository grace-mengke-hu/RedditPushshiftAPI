Tried and failed

I have been smoking for 8 years, though I'm only 23 years old. I struggle with when/how to quit as everyone does. I believe it is especially difficult for me to quit because I'm a restaurant manager, but I have my first child on the way and really want to end my addiction. Anyone else from the industry have pointers or thoughts. I just keep getting more unhealthy by the day! Please help!!

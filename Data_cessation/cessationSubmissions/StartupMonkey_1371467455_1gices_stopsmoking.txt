Day 8, no cravings, but I don't trust myself.

So I left my previous job a week ago and have been away from my usual environment. I used this as a way to quit smoking (and drinking which for me go hand in hand). I'm worried though that I'll go back to smoking in 2 weeks when I am back in my old drinking/smoking environment. I'm 29, I've been smoking heavily since I was 15 odd. Really really want this to be the time I quit. I have once quit for 6 months before. Stress got to me though and I started again. I really want to build as much "armour" around me so that I won't start smoking in a time of weakness, emotion or stress. Any advice appreciated.

Reading Carr's book

Like most smokers, I've been meaning to quit since... forever. I happened upon this subreddit a couple of days ago and saw a lot of talk about Allen Carr, so I decided to get his book with some credit I had on Google Play.

I've heard of him before, but it was actually someone else that had told me about him for another reason. An acquaintance had mentioned how he was one of his biggest influences in changing his perception of himself and helping realize that he had get past irrational fears and "seize the day" if he wanted to enjoy his life. I blew it off as another crazy self-help guru, but had no idea that he was about quitting smoking. Makes sense now since he was a former smoker.

Anyway, I've been reading chapter 21 (The Advantages of Being a Smoker) for about 15 minutes or so.

I like to look at things from a logical perspective wherever I can, so this book is definitely hitting me. I would say "wish me luck", but that implies that I am willing to fail based on a bullshit construct.

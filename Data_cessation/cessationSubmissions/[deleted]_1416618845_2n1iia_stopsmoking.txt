Sometimes we fail

But we should never give up.  I'm going to take a different approach to this. For tonight I am not going to stress over it. When I wake up tomorrow I am going have my first cup of coffee without a cigarette. If I can do that, I have a good chance of delaying that first smoke just a little longer. Progress, not perfection. I live with a smoker so this is a little difficult for me. I moved in with him, so I can't just suddenly tell him to go smoke outside. I want this so bad. I hate smoking; it's expensive, it smells bad, it's unhealthy. There are absolutely no benefits whatsoever to lighting up. 
 
P.S. How do I reset my badge

Edit: Figured out the badge thing. Goodnight all! Tomorrow is another day :)

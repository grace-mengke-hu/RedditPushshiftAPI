I decided today to be done.

Got home from vacation Tuesday night. Smoked a ton of cigarettes. Currently feel like absolute crap. Not necessarily due to the smoking, but I'm sure it didn't help.

I've smoked my way through sinus infections and bronchitis before. But this time, I'm not going to do it. It always ends up extending the illness, and I don't have time for that. I have to plan my wedding. I have to get my resume together. I have to help my fiance figure out our future. 

So today is day one. Again. My short-term goal is to make it to tomorrow. Then through the weekend. Then the first week my fiance is gone for work. If I can make it all the way to my 31st birthday at the end of the month, I think that will officially be the longest I've ever quit. 25 days. I can do that. 

25 days to my birthday. 4 months and 1 day to our wedding. I can do that.

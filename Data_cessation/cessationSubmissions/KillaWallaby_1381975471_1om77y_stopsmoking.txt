A Big Scare

Hi Everyone,

I just had a serious scare-I coughed up blood yesterday, the day before, and today.  Doc said I'm *STILL* dealing with the tar in my lungs and the body's defense systems are still in overdrive and that caused the bleeding. Now look at my badge-I'll wait. I'm still waiting on some test results but I think I am going to be fine. 


Quit now. It takes years to get back to normal.  The best time to quit was the day you started. The second best time is now. 
Thanks for all the support I've found here, I hope none of you have to deal with type of scare.

Today I will not smoke. Are you with me?

Day 1 was yesterday and it sucked big time, but I'm alive.

I pledge that today I will not smoke. I'm going to think about tomorrow when it comes and focus on the next 24 hours.

Also, my boyfriend is an absolute saint for being patient and loving towards me when I was having a rough time with withdrawal yesterday. So today I pledge to do something nice for him to let him know I appreciate it.

Want to join me in making a pledge for today?

Just got a craving ...fighting it off should be easy.

I had some really bad cravings around day 50 and I almost caved, but I didn't and I have been fine since. I just got a craving here on day 78 and my first instinct was confusion, followed by wanting to go for a ride and throw away everything I have worked for. I wanted to post this here to let everyone who has recently quit know that it does get easier. Don't give in. There will be trials, but you can do it. 78-50 = 28 days without even thinking about smoking. If you just quit, this is one of the many blessing you can look forward to. A technique I use for cravings is to think of them as my body/mind repairing itself. I don't know for sure if this is true, but I associate cravings with anything and everything positive, I'm healing! Everyone's experience is different, but I wanted to share mine because It does truly get easier. Well, my craving is now gone. Thanks for listening.

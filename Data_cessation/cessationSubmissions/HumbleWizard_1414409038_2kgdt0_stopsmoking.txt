It's monday, who's with me?!

What better day than October 27th 2014 to quit?  Previous attempt lasted a month and it was one of the best months of my life.  I now know that I don't need any scary reasons to quit. I just don't have a reason to smoke and I never did. 

So cheers to being a non-smoker and anyone who wants to start their day out great, join me in the adventure of making our lives great one step at time.

To any of you who are joining me, post below and maybe we can keep in touch whenever things get hard.  If any of you need extra motivation, I'd be glad to talk anytime, even daily if needed.

Update: Congrats to all of you non-smokers who join me today. Don't forget to return and update everyone on your future progress and possible troubles!

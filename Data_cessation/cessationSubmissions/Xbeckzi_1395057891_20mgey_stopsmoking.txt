Why am I so emotional?

I'm into day 5 of quitting smoking and I cannot stop crying I feel really sad all the time? My cravings are less but yesterday I almost gave in. Is it normal to be so emotional when you quit? I cry for no reason what so ever sometimes?! But I can cry non stop for a good 20 minutes what is wrong with me ðŸ˜«

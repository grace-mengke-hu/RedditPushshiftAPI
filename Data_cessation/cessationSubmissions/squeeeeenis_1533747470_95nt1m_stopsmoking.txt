I feel as though I don't deserve my 672 days Star.

Roughly 2 years after quitting... 


2 weeks ago, stressed out from work, I decided to smoke a ciggy during lunch with a Co-worker. 

Since then, its been a constant lunch time activity; 1-3 ciggys a day. The guilt has been driving me to stress out even more, causing me to smoke more; a pretty shitty cycle. 

Anyway, I don't feel as though this cycle is going to end anytime soon, and I'm nervous that this is going to be my life now.

Anyway... Fuck.

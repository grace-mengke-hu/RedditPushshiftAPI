Time to stop!

I have only been smoking for 18 months or so but it needs to stop. I told myself when I started my new job I'd stop, I didn't. I told myself when I got my new car I'd stop, I didn't. 

Now I have returned from a 10 day piss up in Greece, currently in Germany with the old man and I haven't had a cigarette in 5 days. Also now I'm dating a girl it needs to stop because I don't want to be smelling of it around her.

By the way any Germans here? Your country and your food is spectacular!

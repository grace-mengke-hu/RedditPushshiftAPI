4 weeks of happiness

It's probably my fifth attempt to stop smoking. Finally I feel something has changed in me mentally and emotionally. I don't feel like I am restraining myself from something good.

In fact, I am taking care of myself now. I joined the local gym, I go hiking, I don't feel like a failure anymore. I am never going back. That would be the silliest thing I could do.

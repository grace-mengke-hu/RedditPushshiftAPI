Quitting tobacco (First post on reddit)

Hello world of Reddit,

This is my first post, so I'm not sure if I'm going to do this right. Forgive me if I mess anything up! Anyway, I'm not a smoker, but a dipper. I've dipped since I was 15, and I am 18 now. I was dipping earlier and read a story of a man who got mouth cancer from dip, and the treatments/horror he had to go through. I decided right then and there to quit. Any advice for a quitter? I don't want to smoke e-cigs or use any alternative form of nicotine, I just want to be completely done with it all.

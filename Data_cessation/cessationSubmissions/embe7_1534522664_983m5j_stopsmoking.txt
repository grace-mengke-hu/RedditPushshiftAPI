2 weeks smoke free and disturbing dreams

Hello redditors,

I definitely realized smoking wasn't worth the consequences, and it has been 2 weeks now since i smoke my last cigarette (Been smoking a pack in a week for about 3 months). I experienced anxiety and some intense cravings in the first days, but it has since improved. My only concerns now are those extremely disturbing dreams i have (every night) about myself stealing cigs and sneakily smoking them. 

Was I hooked? Will those dreams go away someday or should i learn to live with them? Same thing for cravings? Do they fade away?

Five days without smoking almost done

Hey guys,

I quit smoking on Wednesday after smoking for 18 years (with maybe 3 years worth of failed quitting in between). The worst part is going out for a drink with friends and not being able to smoke - well I went out yesterday and I didn't give in even though I wanted to smoke on multiple occasions. Every time I crave a cigarette I tell myself two things 1) "The cravings are strong, but short. It will pass soon." 2) "I'm not in control of my impulses, but I'm always in control of my actions." Anyway just wanted to share with you, and maybe get some tips and tricks on fighting the urges.

Have a good one!

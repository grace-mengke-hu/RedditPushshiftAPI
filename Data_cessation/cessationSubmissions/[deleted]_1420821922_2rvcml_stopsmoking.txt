hi guys, juat kind of a vent and a request for advice.

I've just started quitting last week for the NYs resolution. I've smoked since I was 15, am 22 now. All the men in my family have smoked for long periods of time. 

I've tried quitting before, went about 2 months and then fell back into it. This time my so and I are quitting together. I've noticed it's important for me not to say "I've quit smoking" because I've not fully quit, I have only just started. It's been a week, and I want one really badly. The good news is that I can't afford them in chicago any longer, as I'm still a student. But I'm sure I could hold off on lunch and afford some soon :(

I've been doing yoga, and trying not to eat too much. But this is pretty difficult. What advice do you guys have to get past the first month? Because I'm having trouble figuring out how I've made it this far in the past.

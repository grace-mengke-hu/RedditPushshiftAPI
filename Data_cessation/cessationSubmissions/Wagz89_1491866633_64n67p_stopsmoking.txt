Help me to help her

Hi guys. I'm in a little dilemma at the moment. Short backstory is my girlfriend was a smoker for years before we met. Took it up in high school cause she was 'edgy and cool' I've never been addicted to it. I've had a couple with mates when drinking but thats about it. When we got together I told her how much I hated her smoking so she threw the pack out and went cold turkey and it was fine. But that was in the early days of the relationship when you're still trying to impress the other person. 

Since then we've been rather heavy marijuana smokers but have quit that recently as I've been looking for new work and want to avoid pre employment drug tests. So she's quit that with me but has decided to take up smoking again. Now after a month or so of pack a day smoking she's decided to try and quit again. But it hasn't been  the happy experience it was the first time. 

So my question here is what is my role? I want to be supportive and show her that she is doing the right thing but God damn I am finding it hard. It's only been a few days but she is in such a bad mood constantly. I can't talk to her because she's just raging around the house. I try be nice. She gets grumpy. I get grumpy about it and it just makes things worse. So is there anyone that can give me advice on what I can do to help her. Obviously it's a trying time but as someone that doesn't understand the feelings of addiction to nicotine I'm not sure that I'm being very helpful in the situation. And I don't want to let this get too out of control. 

TL;DR. Girlfriends quitting. How can I support her best?

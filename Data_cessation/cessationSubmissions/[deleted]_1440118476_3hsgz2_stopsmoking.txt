One week. Feeling empty and depressed.

I feel weird. There are two types of cravings for me: the one after I eat, after I drink coffee, after I go out and drink with friends, it really is hard. 

But then there's another. It isn't even a real neurological craving. When I know I'm going out, when I know I'll be alone for hours, when I know I'll spend the day away from home... it feels like I have lost a friend. 

A pack was my company, something I could rely on, something to make my anxiety go away. If I was nervous because of some event in my life I knew I had a cig. At the end of the day, it was there to help me. I feel depressed because I will not smoke again.

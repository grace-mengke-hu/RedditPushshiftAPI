When I feel an intense craving to smoke I listen to this song. Maybe it can help you too.

Muse - Defector 

This song represents my relationship with nicotine. It's my dialogue to my addiction.
Once it has played through, my craving has usually gone and I feel empowered. 

Do you have a song that works like this for you?

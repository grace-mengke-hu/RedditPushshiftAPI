Made it 1 week!

8 days since quit day and 7 days since last puff! Not vaping or any other nicotine. Feeling really proud of myself. I'm also going to be the most hydrated chick ever with the best teeth because I've replaced smoking with drinking tons of water and using floaters, toothpicks, and brush picks. 

Feeling over the hump but I know not to let my guard down because I'm sure there will be more bad days that will test this resolve. Still...this is the best I've done in a long time.

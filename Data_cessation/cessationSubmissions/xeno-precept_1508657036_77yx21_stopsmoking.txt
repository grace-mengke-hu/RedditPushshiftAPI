I need help, guys!

I've been extremely bothered by the ill health consequences by my and my husband's smoking and am desparate to quit, BUT IT'S SO HARD!! I was able to quit cold turkey once but now it seems damn near impossible. I've downloaded apps to help but they're only as good as my willpower -- it's not the same as having a support group of actual people encouraging you. What have you guys found easiest in your journeys?

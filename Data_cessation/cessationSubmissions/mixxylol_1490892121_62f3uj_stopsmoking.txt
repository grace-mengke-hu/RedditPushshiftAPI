Today is my quit day - Jitters and patches

My smoking cessation doctor prescribed me to wear a 21mg and a 7mg at the same time. I'm having overwhelming bouts of anxiety and jitters. 

Is there anything you can recommend that may help? I removed the 7mg because I feel like it's possible I'm getting too much. Also just needed to vent my worries. Thanks.

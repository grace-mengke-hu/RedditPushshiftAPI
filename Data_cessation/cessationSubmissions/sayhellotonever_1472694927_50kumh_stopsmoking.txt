Switched from smoking to e-cig for five days now... feeling the urge but the vape (medium strength, 12mg) helps.

I feel a little crappy because I'm still doing nicotine, but I've order some e-liquid of lower strengths to hopefully cut it down over the next months.

I'm 26 and have been smoking since 13; heavy smoker since 18. Anyone on a similar path?

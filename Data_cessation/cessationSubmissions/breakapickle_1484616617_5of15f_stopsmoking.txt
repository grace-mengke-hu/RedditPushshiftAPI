Getting tough again.

Around day 5 it started getting easier,  but starting yesterday and throughout today it got really tough. I stayed in bed all day and feel really blue and low on energy. 

Good news is that it didn't lead me to cave in and smoke,  but I am really tempted to. How long can I expect this depression and anxiety to last?

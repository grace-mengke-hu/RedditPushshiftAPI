Four years smoke free today!!

Four years ago I decided I was done smoking for good, done with the shame, done with the paranoia over my health, especially after watching my parents suffer through smoking related diseases - my mother passed two years later from lung cancer. After nine years and three attempts, the longest of which was 5 months, I woke up on May 8th, 2014 and decided I was a non smoker. 

I won't tell you it was easy in the beginning. I had to learn how to be idle without smoking, go through breakups and deaths, get drunk, be angry. Smoking carves a niche into every facet on your life but I guarantee you that are stronger than it. 

The first couple weeks were difficult and I remember day 9 being the worst day where I contemplated suicide. I knew if I smoked the feelings would go away but it would be fleeting and I'd be back at square one all over again. I knew if I just took a breath and let the moment pass, the pride I would feel in kicking this addiction would be beyond any feeling nicotine could manufacture. By the end of the first year my family would tell me they didn't even remember me smoking and couldn't picture it. Being a non-smoker became such a natural thing to me. I still check in here sometimes to remind myself to never take another puff, though cravings are very rare. 

If you're in the early days please don't give up. Make the choice not to smoke every day and before you know it you'll be celebrating years of being smoke-free too!

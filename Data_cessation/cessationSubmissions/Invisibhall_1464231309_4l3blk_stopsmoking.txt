Cleaning out the lungs for forming babby

Hi, I'm 36 (37 next week), freshly married, and need to quit smoking so we can get cracking on having a kid. 

I have been smoking since I was 12ish. I quit twice when I was pregnant 16 & 17 years ago. I'm a pack a day Camel Light person. I have tried and hated patches, gum, vaping. Chantix was SUPER effective, briefly, but I backslid and have no desire to spend another three months sick to my stomach all the damn time.

I am finishing the pack I have, it should get me to bedtime and going cold turkey tomorrow (it's easier to not smoke if I don't have the first one of the day). I have already apologized to husband for the next three days. I have lots of busy work and new books in the house for distraction.

I welcome almost any advice, but I will absolutely not be using any sort of nicotine replacement, I just want the addiction to be over. A Reddit community has helped me to move on with my life after going NC with my family, I'm hoping this one will help me get through this!

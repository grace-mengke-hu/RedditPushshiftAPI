Smoke-free for a month now I can't stop yawning

Title. I smoked for almost 15 years, and I just quit about a month ago. I've "quit" several times before for months at a time with no issues.  I wasn't a heavy smoker, I smoked about a 1/4 pack a day. But this time,  I have noticed that I'm coughing up brown specks occasionally, constantly clearing mucus from my chest (it's clear except for the specks) and I am yawning excessively. By excessively, I mean I yawn about 20 times a minute, and I wake up several times a night with an intense urge to yawn. Has anyone else experienced this?

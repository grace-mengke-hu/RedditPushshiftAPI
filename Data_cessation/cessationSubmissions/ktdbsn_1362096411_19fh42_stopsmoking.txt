Four days in and I'm having the worst cravings yet.

Gave up on the nicotine patches yesterday, as I felt all they were doing for me was constantly reminding me how good it felt to smoke - and even then I still needed to smoke. I felt better without them, until now.

How can I get over these cravings?

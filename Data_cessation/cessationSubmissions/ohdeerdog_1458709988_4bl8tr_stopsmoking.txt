54 hours in heavy ex-smoker pausing my diet for a while

I've been on and off a ketogenic diet for a few months and while it's great for my mental health (and my sexy, sexy body), it just isn't cutting it right now. I HAD to eat two chocolate bars last night. And pretzels. And rice cakes. And peanut butter. And I'm skipping gym today because I'm bloated.

But at least I'm not smoking, right? Right!?

I know you all usually say eating is far better than smoking and I bet it is. Let's just hope my cravings diminish enough that I can get back on keto before I become a balloon.

EDIT: I'm back on the diet

4 days in. Not so cold turkey. Need advice. Day 4.

Alright so I finally gave it up. 

Then I fucked up and had a 2 smokes at a party on day 2. 

Tonight is day 4 and I bought I swisher and smoked about an 8th of it. Let's be real, I probably will smoke the rest of it as the night is over. 

Am I cheating myself or am I tapering?

This shit sucks. I'm moody and I snap at people. I work in a tip based industry and I keep snapping at people for being assholes. 

Advice? Should I go full cold turkey or should I just limit? I'm a pack every two or three days smoker so I feel like this an improvement.

Please help. I honestly love smoking and it gives me a huge stress relief. These few days have been tough.

Quitting in high stress environments

Hello. Obviously one of the biggest reasons quitting is so hard is stress. I'm in a continuously tense, volatile and fearful situation. I also currently have and have had a long history of crippling anxiety. I'm trying to work on many issues but smoking has been the most important one. I smoke around a pack a day currently. I also have a very tiny support system for any of it. Anyways, I'm bogging this down with useless details. So, how do you quit when you've entirely forgotten how to relax or even just not be in constant terror? It's a viscous circle.

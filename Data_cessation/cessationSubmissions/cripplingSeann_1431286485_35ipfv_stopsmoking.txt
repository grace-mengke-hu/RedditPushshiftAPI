I just finished reading They Easy Way by Allen Carr

Very informative and inspiring and at a very good time in my life too.

I was informed the other day that my job was switching to a new insurance provider. I have health insurance through my work. It will come with a lower payment out of each paycheck however, smokers will be charged and additional $50 per check. Fuck that.

I learned this the day after my book came in the mail. The only smokers at my job are myself and my boss. We have to either stop smoking, be uninsured or possibly be fired for lying about our habit. I think the choice is pretty clear.

So with that and having read the final chapter, I have smoked my last cigarette. I know the next few days are going to be weird as I've tried to do this twice in the past. But I'm not afraid now.

And with that I'm off to have a drink with a buddy who happens to be an ex smoker. It's what I would have done smoking or not so I might as well enjoy myself the best I can while going through wht will be the worst of it.

Cheers!

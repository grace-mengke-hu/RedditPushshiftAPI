An interesting thought

I was procrastinating getting an antibiotic prescription filled for a dental issue. I didnt want to leave the house cause I felt sort of run down and tired from the infection and I didnt want to spend the money. I remembered though, that if I was still smoking I would have left the house, no matter how poorly I felt, to get cigarettes. Its that change from doing whatever it took to get cigarettes to doing whatever it takes to take care of myself that's so important to self care and quitting smoking. Its been a major shift in my life and put more money in my pocket. I got the prescription filled and the copay was only $7.00. 

If you're in the process, keep up the good work, you're worth it!

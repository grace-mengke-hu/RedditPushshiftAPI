I'm almost at a month smoke free, but have been struggling with anxiety/panic attacks again.


So in September I made the decision to stop smoking cold turkey after 4 years of smoking. It so far has been going well, quitting wise. The cravings have even seemed to pass. The only thing I am really struggling with is my anxiety. I've struggled with anxiety/panic attacks since I was a junior in high school. It got pretty bad after I graduated, to the point were I couldn't leave the house. But for the past 4-5 years I thought my anxiety was finally over with. I was doing much better.

Now almost a month after quitting I feel like its back and I don't know why. I find my self worrying and panicking over ridiculous things. I know its all in my head and that I can beat this, but it just seems so hard. It almost got to the point were I thought maybe having a cigarette with fix it.

Tired

I've been 5 days smoke free and today I woke up really sad and the cravings were too much. I bought a pack, smoked one and a half then got pissed that I did something so stupid and threw the pack away. I'm tired of this cycle, I'm tired of feeling like I can't keep this shit in check. This addiction has wrecked havoc on my life. I used to run and I haven't ran since December. Smoking had become my hobby. I miss who I used to be without this. I can feel myself coming out of it, and as soon as I see the light at the end of the tunnel and think I have this figured out, I fall back in. I guess I'm just putting this out there so I can go back to this post and remind myself how  much I hate this and can remember the anger and frustration I feel right now. I just need to take a breath, and move forward. 

Side note: Bon Jovi's Last Cigarette started playing through my music app as I was typing this. Coincidence? ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

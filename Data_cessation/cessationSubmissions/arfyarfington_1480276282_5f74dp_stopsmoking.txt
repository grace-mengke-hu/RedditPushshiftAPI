I'm no longer a damn smoker

My husband and I have come to Paris for our honeymoon, and I swear to you almost everybody smokes. Everywhere! So I cracked. They've got my favourite brand in every tobacco selling shop (which is non existent in the UK) and I broke, gave in and bought a pack. Managed four tokes and had to put it out cause it gave me none of that happy feeling. Tasted like shit. I know I should be happy, but goddamit it's so weird to not be a smoker any more.

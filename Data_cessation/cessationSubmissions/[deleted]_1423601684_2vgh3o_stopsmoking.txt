I found my trigger..

And I went from 4 days to 0 in the blink of an eye. I let little things get to me.. In this case, and most cases, Jealousy. It rips you up. And the only way I knew how to calm myself is to throw a wad of rotten plants in my lip. But it only made me feel worse.. 

Sorry everybody. I just wanted to share. Now I have 2 things to quit! 

What were some of your triggers?

Quality Vape?

Can anyone recommend a decent vape that doesn't cost a couple hundred bucks?  I was originally going to do this cold turkey but I'm thinking that a vape may be a better solution.  

Also, I'd prefer to use PayPal and order online if possible.  Only because I use PayPal credit and orders over $99 get 6 months no interest.

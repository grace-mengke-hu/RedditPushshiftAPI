So I played tennis today and..

It was amazing.

I played for an hour in the hot Miami sun, non-stop.
For the first time since I can remember, I didn't get out of breath. I actually played better than I ever have and I was not even close to being tired. I even surprised myself.

I volunteered to get the balls every time we had to pick them up and It felt fucking great. I haven't felt like that in over 7 years. 

To those who are quitting, keep fighting the good fight brothers and sisters. It is so worth it. 

WOOOOoooooo

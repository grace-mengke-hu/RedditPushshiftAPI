BOOM! 6 MONTHS :)

I am just absolutely flawed that I have gone six whole months without cigarettes! I barely even think about it anymore.

To those of you just beginning your quitting journey, I want you to know that it is totally worth it. 

And to those who are contemplating quitting, do it! Seriously.

See you all in another six months for the big one year :)

So. Tired.

I’ve gone through the cold turkey dance twice in my life. This time around, I’m experiencing a different set of withdrawal symptoms. I am extremely fatigued and feel like I have the flu. In the past, I had experienced insomnia and irritability. 

I started again about four months ago when I was going through an ugly breakup. Then school became extremely overwhelming and I began to use cigarettes as a crutch. At my worst, I was smoking 3/4 a pack a day.

I began to slowly cut back until I was at 5 a day, one pack every 4 days. Last night, I decided the last of my pack would be my final cigarette, that it was time for me to start moving forward with my life.

I’m happy with this decision and know that this is the best time for me to quit, as my boss is out of town. I just wish I had more energy.

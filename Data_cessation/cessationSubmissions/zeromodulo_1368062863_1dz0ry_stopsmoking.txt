First day smoke-free.

Quit smoking yesterday. Before that, I smoked for probably more than a year. During that year, I've always struggled with quitting.

The choice is pretty clear now. I did some searching and found stories of smokers who have had operations or died of cancer, they are really sad and heartbreaking.

I bookmarked the stories I found, so whenever I feel like having a cigarette, I remind myself why I quit. Works every time.

Never before has it ever been so easy for me to quit. Seeing what smoking ultimately does to you makes it so much easier to quit. If you're struggling with quitting, [stories like these](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn8JYcApjlY) are very powerful and convincing.

I have never found such powerful motivation to quit. A graphic education of the dangers of smoking, and that's pretty much all it takes for me.

I've been sneezing and hacking up phlegm all day. It appears all of the buildup that has occurred over the past year is now on its way out. It is awful and disgusting.

I've realized how much life I've lost in just a year. Ever since I started smoking, my life has gone completely downhill. I gave up my job, lost the will and motivation to work, lost my car, my apartment, my girlfriend, everything. All I wanted to do for that whole year was smoke. Nothing else. Thinking back about it, I just want to cry because of how much I lost. I had such an awesome life, and now I have to start over again.

It gave me headaches, I struggled to breathe, I became emotional and flew off the handle easily... it just turned me into a horrible person.

It's not worth it. It never is.

Update: Thanks guys, you're awesome.

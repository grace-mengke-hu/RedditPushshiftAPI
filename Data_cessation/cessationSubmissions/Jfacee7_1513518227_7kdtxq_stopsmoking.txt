46 days! Here’s some tips

After all the books, stories &amp; articles I’ve read somehow these two paragraphs stayed with me and I referenced them during cravings. They really empowered me and I hope they do the same for you. Copy and paste them somewhere so you can read them during a craving! I simply don’t remember the source, it could be years ago... could even be partially from here, so credit to whoever.



“Instead of moping about it, say to yourself, 'I know what it is. It's the withdrawal pang from nicotine. That's what smokers suffer all their lives and that's what keeps them smoking. Non-smokers do not suffer these pangs. It is another of the many evils of this drug. Isn't it marvelous I am purging this evil from my body!'

Think of the whole business of stopping as an exciting game. Think of the nicotine monster as a sort of tape worm inside your stomach. You have got to starve him for three weeks, and he is going to try to trick you into lighting a cigarette to keep him alive.”



Other tips: 

- Patches (one box of full strength, cut into smaller and smaller fractions... the goal is to get off of nicotine! 8 weeks seemed too long. If you’re a heavy smoker don’t make it too difficult and go cold turkey, but also be aware to not stay on patches)

-Hygiene is your new hobby. Brush your teeth! Take an extra shower! Take longer showers! Boost your immune system and learn to enjoy being clean and fresh! Practice “smoking” fresh air by breathing in and exhaling enjoyable outdoor oxygen. Enjoy mints and herbal teas. Focus on scents of soaps, lotions, colognes and just relax!

-Exercise! This could be the biggest thing, but my main tip is don’t overdo it! 5 push ups... a walk, or short jog. Your lungs are healing and the last thing you want to do is induce stress... but for all the new dull, bored, or anxious moments, fill them with movement... it really releases some wonderful endorphins!

Best of luck to all of you. Be positive! And remember you are a non-smoker the very second you decide you are!

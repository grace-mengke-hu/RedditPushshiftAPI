Shouldn't I reward myself by smoking a cigarette for reaching the 7th day?

People who tried it.. How did it feel? im sure the buzz hit hard! 
but did all the addiction come back? did you feel like those days that stopped at all went to waste? or was it more of a checkpoint that u smoked then carried on the process of quiting.

Edit: thank you all for the negative responses, you may not realize it but those ' dumb ' and ' stupid ' comments kept me from smoking a cig. I really feel like you helped me bigtime from me making a big mistake. Thanks again

Question if you have been smoke free for 6 months or more and you relapsed.

I have been almost 90 days smoke free.....YAY me! :) I started smoking more then 20 years ago and smoked more then 20 cigarettes a day. This is the first time that I have ever gone this long without smoking at all. The one other time that I quit smoking I would have a cigarette every once in awhile, which in turn eventually did lead me back to being a full time smoker. 

I have read several times on here people that have been smoke free for 6 months on that started smoking again. 6 months seems to be a hard time, I am not sure why. What happened and why do you think you started smoking again? Do you have any advice for me to remain a non smoker?

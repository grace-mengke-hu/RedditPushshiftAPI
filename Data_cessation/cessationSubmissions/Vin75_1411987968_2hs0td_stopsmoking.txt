Supply Issues - Nicotine Lozenges [Australia]

I have a referral to a hypnotherapist to get me off nicotine. Its been sitting on my desk for over a year and I think its now time for me to do something about it. 

A few months ago, Nicabate Minis were withdrawn from the market. They were my security blanket. I have been on them for over 3 years and when I had them on me I didn't smoke. I didn't even think about smoking. When they were withdrawn I moved onto Nicorette Cooldrops... reluctantly. They were so sickly sweet in comparison and I was hanging out for my Minis to come back... found out they were recalled for inconsistent sizing and nicotine concentration or something... I didn't even take that many of them - maybe 5 a day. The smell of cigarette smoke didn't bother me - Nothing could get me back on the smokes when I had the Minis in my pocket. Even when I was drinking.

Months later, I got used to the Cooldrops, and now, all of a sudden there is no supply of them. What is going on?? No information is available - I have searched the net and cannot find a single explanation. Everywhere is out of stock.

So today I am on the gum. It was that or back on the smokes. And unfortunately, it has been this helpless situation of nicotine addiction that has made me realise that I am a chronic addict and need to get off the stuff of I am ever going to be free of that drug.

I have tried everything - Champix worked the best and the longest with the awesome side effect of amazing sexually vivid dreams. But I think I need to do it "unassisted" - well, without the assistance of drugs or nicotine. So its off to the hypnotist for me - and if that doesn't work, I'm going into some other form of psychotherapy. I think its the only way for me.


But if anyone has any news as to why these lozenge devices are vanishing from the market, I would love to know. I have subscribed to this subreddit and will be here, looking for help and guidance on the way. Glad its here...

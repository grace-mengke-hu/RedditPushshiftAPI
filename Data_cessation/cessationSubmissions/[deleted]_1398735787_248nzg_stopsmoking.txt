I just realized today it's been a year... Totally forgot about it for a while!

So I stopped cold turkey last year, same day. I had taken a week off to move out to a new place and I decided to stop smoking cigarettes at the same time. 

It was hard at first, but having people around to talk to was really helpful. It might sound selfish, but I liked coming here to read threads about people who just started quitting. I could compare my situation with theirs and see how better I was feeling overall. Also those who had quit for a long time were always inspiring and motivating.

I had some "relapses" though. I started college while working, both full-time, so I had a lot of stress going on. So I started smoking with a tobacco pipe once in a while, just to calm down. I did that for about 3 months, and in the end I noticed that I was heading back towards the habit. 

But the good thing about tobacco pipes is that it's not as easy to light up as with a cigarette, and the tobacco is much less accessible too. So I just stopped one day, threw away the pipe and that was it.

The funny thing is that tobacco pipes brought me to a higher standard in terms of tobacco quality. I did smoke cigarettes once or twice since then, when I was drunk and I felt like it, but the taste was horrible and I didn't finish. Just ended up with a headache and a nasty after-taste.

So anyways, I guess I wanted to say for those of you that are starting, that getting out of the habit is the most difficult thing. After the first month or so, I stopped caring about the fact that I quit. I may have relapsed, but I wasn't hard on myself when it happened and I just didn't get back in the habit.

I'll probably be leaving this subreddit now, so **to all of you who just quit or are about to quit, I wish you the best and remember that however crappy or anxious you might feel, you won't die and it's temporary :)**

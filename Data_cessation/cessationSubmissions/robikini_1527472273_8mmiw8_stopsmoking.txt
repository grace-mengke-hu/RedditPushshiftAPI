My acrylic nails no longer break now that I quit smoking!

I'm a chronic nail biter, so I get fake acrylic nails to look more professional at work.  Ever since I quit smoking 75 days ago, I never need to replace a nail that broke or fell off.  And I get them filled every three weeks!  I can't think of anything else it could be except no longer smoking. I've also started gardening with/without gloves, and still, no breaks!

Guy I don't want to sound rude but here a tip for you.

If your going to give up smokeing do it when you wake up in the morning. That way you have not smoked in like 8 or what Eva Amount of hours you have been asleep. I see people just randomly  say OK this is my last one  that's got to   hardest thing to do and I don't think it's gonna work for you. You wake up practically a none smoker it's when you smoke again you start back up. Best of luck to everyone anyway I know it's hard. I'm only on day 8 ðŸ¤žðŸ˜˜

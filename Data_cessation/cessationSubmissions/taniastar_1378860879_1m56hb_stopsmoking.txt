I want to hep my boyfriend quit smoking, what should I do?

My boyfriend smokes, he is currently trying to quit and hasn't smoked for about 5 days, but has tried to quit lots before but ends up failing. I really want to help him stick to it but don't know how to help. What would you guys advise I do? What worked for you? What do you wish your girlfriend/boyfriend did to help you quit?

Thank you!! And good luck with your own quitting!!

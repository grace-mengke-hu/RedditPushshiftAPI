Almost 20 days

Today is my twentieth day in a row without a cigarette. I found this reddit on day one, and reading it helped me a lot. 

I have smoked for a while. I started in middle school, quit in high school, and smoked all through college. I quit after I graduated, and it lasted for over four years. And even though I promised myself that I would never smoke again...

My latest stint at smoking has lasted about 3 years. I still remember the first pack I bought. I had been bumming before that. After that I always had my own cigarettes. And still, every day I would have a moment where I couldn't believe that I had started again. 

I have wanted to quit for a while, and in November my best friend and I started getting serious about it. At least we we were talking about it. And, after a trip to Michigan where I came back to Chicago with five packs of five dollar Indiana cigarettes, I decided those were it. And, I almost made it, had to buy one pack of twelve dollar Chicago to avoid quitting in the middle of a work shift. But, that was twenty days ago! 

I feel guilty saying this, but this quit was easy. The first three days were pretty awful, but even then I was so confident that this would be my last quit and that I never wanted to put myself through quitting again that I was able to power through it. I have had some triggers and cravings (fewer and fewer everyday) but I just remind myself that I do not want to be a smoker again, that even one cigarette is relapse, and that the trigger is just synapses firing in my brain, and I can ignore it. 

Thanks for listening to my story! I look forward to sharing with this board!

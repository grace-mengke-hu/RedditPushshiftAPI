Day 15/ day 1

Hello guys.
So, (i tought) i've quit smoking 2 weeks ago, but i kind of smoked half a cigarette yesterday. So i guess it's back to square one! That dosen't really bother me, since i know i'm gonna quit for good now, i have the right mindset. The reason i smoked that half a cigarette yesterday was to prove myself i dont like, and it was true, it tasted like crap!
Even tought it's back to day 1, it really dosen't feel like that, i have no really bad cravings or desperate urges to smoke. Today i stoped for no reason to take a deep breath and enjoy the fact that i can smell things for real for the first time in years. It's all good, this subreddit really helps! Good luck guys, it's all up to you to quit

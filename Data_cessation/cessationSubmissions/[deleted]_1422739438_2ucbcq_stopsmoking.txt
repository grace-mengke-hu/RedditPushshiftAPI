Near constant headache?

I'm on day 5 and the throbbing headache will not go away. It's not a craving that comes and goes, it's a thickness in my head that is with me all day long. Since yesterday morning.

Is this normal? When the hell is it going to stop?

I drink tons of water, I've been eating fruits and veggies and exercising. I'm doing great otherwise, but this constant headache has got to go!

I think I may have had a cold prior to quitting (hard to tell when you're a smoker).

I've avoided taking any medications, but I think I might pop some advil.

2 Weeks today!

I went to the lake over the weekend.  Had many alcoholic beverages.  Last week we did the same thing and I had to chew ~4 pieces of nicotine gum.  This time is the cravings were not as strong and I resisted chewing the nicotine gum.  Feels good to just say no to any and all forms of nicotine :)  Keep up the good fight, Everyone!!

Getting a little aggravated. Post smokers cough? Cold? or allergies?

I quit a month ago (almost to the day!) 
I started coughing almost immediately, which I knew could happen. Here I am a month later, my nose has been stuffed and I've been post nasal dripping and hawking up loogs (gross I know) since I quit. I've never had allergies before so I have no idea if this is what I'm feeling. I feel 100% fine otherwise, no body aches, no sore throat, no loss of energy. So maybe not a cold?

What the hell do I have?! Lmao I don't know if I need meds or if I should run it through. I know- I could go to the doctor, but unless I'm in pain I don't go to the doctor because I don't want to pay (Insurance in the U.S. is ASS)

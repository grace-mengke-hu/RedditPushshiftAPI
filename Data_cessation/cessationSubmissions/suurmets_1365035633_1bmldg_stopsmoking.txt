After 33 days

Hi all!!!

I started the quitting process in the beginning of February with the help of those Niquitin mini's. Well they did and didn't work at the same time
but for my luck they had strong mint flavour (its important).
i was on and off this whole time with the siggis (i like it spelled that way)
but at the end of February i think week before March my throat got 
bit soar from small cold and thanks to that it was difficult to use those tablets (the strong minty flavour). So luckily i put off of taking next tablet and after 12 hours i thought "Hey i am here feeling fine so why not try for another 12?" That "another 12" became 33 days for now (i didn't want to request badge here until week later so 43 in reality but i like it to be 33). 

Now i have gained few more motivations so i won't start again:

1. I like running, i done my jogging for a year (i am an ex fatty and now a reader of /r/fatpeoplestories). Every week i had to run my lungs so-called open so i could breath again normally.
Now nothing, i just run and can run much longer distances than ever before!

2. I have always loved Martial Arts specially, Ju-Jutsu. Only type of 
Ju-Jutsu in my city (Not US) is Hokutoryu Ju-Jutsu (mix of Kick-box and Ju-Jutsu) and it is brutal physical exercise. I now know that i could not handle a single training if i smoked!

Other than all of that, my life haven't changed a lot (besides more exercise of course) i still go to work have same cues to go for a smoke except they don't associate with smoking any more. I only remember
smoking when i see somebody smoke.

If anybody have any questions how or why and so on i am here and will support anybody who wants :)

P.S. Sorry for spelling my native is not English.

Withdrawals are in

I began smoking at 13, averaging 10 a day for about 7 years.  
I stubbed my last on the 23rd this month, and it's been a painful hell ever since. On the 24th, i earned myself a sore throat that doesn't seem to respond to any form of anti-inflammatory, a nose with a seemingly endless supply of mucus, and I'm sure I'll come down with a full-fledged fever by tomorrow.  
Not to mention my mental condition has wrecked, I become extremely sarcastic and sharp tongued to everybody just to satisfy my oral fixation.   
But you know what?   
I love it. I just did not expect such a fast and heavy response from the biological nicotine withdrawal team. Does anyone know when it'll finally stop? Or what other illnesses I'll come down with in the near future?   
Every puff is an overpriced handcuff. Stub it out, or it'll really get rough.

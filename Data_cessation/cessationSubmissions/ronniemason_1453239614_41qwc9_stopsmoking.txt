Day 10 Update (With Some Concerns)

So, I'm on day 10 of my quit, and so far I've not had too difficult of a time handling the cravings. I faced one of my biggest concerns yesterday: four hours driving on a mini road trip. On this trip, I would typically have six or seven cigarettes just on the way there. It wasn't easy, but I made it through.

Now, a few things that are concerning me. I've heard about "quitters flu," and I know that I've got a touch of it. I've got a dry cough, which doesn't concern me too much. I got some Mucinex to try to help loosen any junk in my lungs. However, I've got a lot of sinus pressure also, some trouble breathing, and my ears are very clogged. 

Did this happen to anyone else? If so, about how long did you experience such symptoms? And if so, did it get worse?

I mostly want to know what to expect, so that I don't ever find myself using these "side-effects" as a reason to light up a smoke.

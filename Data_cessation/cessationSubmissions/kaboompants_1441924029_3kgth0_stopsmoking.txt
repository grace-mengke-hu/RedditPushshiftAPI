A larger context of self-improvement?

Hey SS, has anyone else put their cessation from smoking in a larger context of self-improvement?  I've heard of some people putting down the cigarettes because they want to run a marathon, or go scuba diving or what-have-you.  If that's the case, i'd love to hear about it.

For me it's the latest effort in ~2 years of e.g. developing my emotional IQ & social skills, prioritizing my own needs/wants over others', stopping drinking, traveling & volunteering people, getting in to shape, and others.

Stay strong y'all.

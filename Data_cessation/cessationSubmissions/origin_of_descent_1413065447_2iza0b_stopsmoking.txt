200 days!!! And I'm spreading the joy!

Hi all! I am proud to say that I've passed 200 days without a cigarette. It's been a tough, enlightening, and thrilling ride here, and I am only looking forward to a smoke-free future.

But my friends, do you know what the best feeling is? Not the saved cash (about $1000!!!), not the lack of lingering stench, but it's helping others. Some friends who are heavier smokers have noticed my improvements, and now I'm helping them out! They're probably going to read this post (cos I made sure to direct them to this subreddit for support). So if anyone out there is struggling to remain smoke-free, try helping out others in their quitting process--it's quite empowering!

Good luck everyone, whether you're thinking of quitting, just starting your smoke-free life, or you have left the cancer-sticks far in the past. I thank you all for the support (even when I lurk) and hope this sub continues to save lives!

You can do it! (that is all)

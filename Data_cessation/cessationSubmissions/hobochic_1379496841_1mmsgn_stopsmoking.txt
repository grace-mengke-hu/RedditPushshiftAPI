im nervous

hey so after lurking on for months with this r/stopsmoking, i have tried to quit cold turkey but failed, then tried the ecigs, failed. so im doing cold turkey attempt again. im confident this time..i just get so nervous and i feel like i need a cigarette to be in a normal mood as weird as that sounds. last times i have quit i had been irritable but also my mind felt foggy. wish me luck this time. and if anyone have any tips on handling stress?

Quitting smoking - some facts and figures

Following a discussion about quitting with /u/Armison, I ran into this [study by the Canadian Lung Association](http://lung.ca/_resources/Making_quit_happen_report.pdf).

Armison made me realize that there are many concepts that are not backed up by fact out there. So in the spirit of learning more about the process, here are some facts and figures I found interesting:

* one-third of ex-smokers were able to quit permanently on their first attempt

* of the smokers surveyed 91% indicate at least some desire to quit smoking. More than three-quarters (79%) have already tried to quit. For those who have tried, an average of six quit attempts was reported.

* seven out of every ten ex-smokers surveyed said that when they finally quit for good, the cessation method they used on their final quit attempt was the “cold turkey” method

I also read (don't remember the source) that the success rate for each attempt is 6% (on average, independent of method used). Have you come across other stats/numbers that are surprising or thought provoking?

20 hours in

Slightly restless and bored. Feels like somethings missing, but i know im not missing out on anything.  I've quit in my life before....gone back to the dirty stuff so many times. 

I've battered my lungs with weed and cigs over so many years (32 now). Must treat my damn body better!

Hope this is a long clean streak...&amp; thanks for all the posts on here!

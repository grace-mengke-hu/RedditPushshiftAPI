Survived Adderall with no smoking!

Honestly I never thought I could do it. I had lots of smoking triggers (drinking, being around other smokers, driving) but Adderall is what made me a pack a day plus smoker.

Do I want a cigarette when I'm on it? Um, yeah. I walk around campus and see smokers *everywhere*. I can catch a whiff of cigarette smoke from 100 ft away. I can tell if someone has smoked one just by talking to them.

But I haven't smoked one, despite all the temptation. I'm so proud of myself. I think the thing that has helped the most is just knowing that I'm not going to smell anymore.

My academic department is really small (like, 12 people) and we're in the same classes all day. I've told everyone that I quit, so coming in smelling like it would just be plain embarrassing.

Anyways, woohoo! I feel like the worst is behind me.

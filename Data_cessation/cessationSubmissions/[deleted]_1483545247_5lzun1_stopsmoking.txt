Week 1 down.

Lets hope it takes this time! 

Got incredibly drunk on the 28th and smoked a pack with the plan on quitting the 29th. I never smoke on my hangover day so this is how I always start my quit attempts. The difference this time was that I had a week of holidays after which I had absolutely nothing to do. Zero reason to leave the house. So I plopped my ass down on the couch, opened my shiny new PS4 and played an unhealthy amount FFXV. 

I've also given up booze temporarily. No more glass(es) of wine at night which is certainly helping keep the cravings down.

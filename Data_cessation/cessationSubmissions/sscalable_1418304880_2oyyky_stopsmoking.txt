Quit while I was sick last week

I have always told myself I would quit before I reach 30. That would be the max. I used to only smoke spring and summer, quit in october and start again in may or april as soon as the weather started improving. But that faded and I just smoked fulltime. My fianc√© hates it and she's the main motivation to quit. I had a really soar throat last week and couldnt even smoke. Then I realised im almost turning 31, so that all together seemed like a good reason. I quit before and the first couple of weeks I don't find that hard, but after 4 months or so it gets harder for me, so let's hope I wont smoke ever again.

I do it cold turkey btw, I find it easier.

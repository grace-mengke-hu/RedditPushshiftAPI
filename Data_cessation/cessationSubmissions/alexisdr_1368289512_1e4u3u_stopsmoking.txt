I quit at midnight!

It has officially been ten hours since my last smoke! I'm 22, I have been smoking for 4 years. It has become hard to breathe over the last week and that has terrified me into quitting.
I quit drinking 2.5 years ago and, let me tell you, quitting smoking is way harder.
I'm hoping to get out of the smoker's mindset and really focus on the positive. Although I keep forgetting that I'm making a decision not to smoke today!
Any and all advice is welcome ... even the abnoxious stuff. Reddit, please help me get through the next couple days!

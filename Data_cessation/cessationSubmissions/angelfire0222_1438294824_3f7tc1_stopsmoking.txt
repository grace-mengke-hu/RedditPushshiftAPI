I think I need help

I am trying to quit smoking. I have cut down significantly - I'm down to one or two a day - but I can't seem to cut out those last couple per day. The main reason that I smoke is to take breaks from work. Sometimes I just need a little 5 minute break, and just going outside and not smoking doesn't quite do it for me, even though I am distracting myself. I'm not sure what exactly I can do about it.I do have reasons to quit but nothing apparent. The biggest being that my fianc√© and I are going to try to have a baby, but this just doesn't seem to be enough. Does anyone have any advice for me? Anyone go through a similar situation in trying to quit? What has worked for you?

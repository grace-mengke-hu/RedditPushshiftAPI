Smoked half a cig after 4 days... help

I am 22 and I've been smoking 15-20 cigs per day for 5 years and 1+ pack per day during 2014. Most people who see me smoke are surprised and tell me that I don't look like a smoker and that there's no external sign of it.

I quit in september 2013 thanks to an e-cig, but it only lasted a month because I didn't really like it or enjoy it as I do with regular cigs. That was my only successful attempt to quit for more than a day. I usually smoke before the first 24 hours of smoking are over. I did this hundreds of times...

I decided to quit once and for all recently, and called it "clean december". I smoked my last cig on 30 november at 10pm. It was the last one of the pack I bought the same morning at 8. 

I've been smoke free since then. I had many urges but always kept my mouth busy with a mint gum. Until yesterday... after exactly 3 days and 23 hours (tracked with quitnow app) when I couldn't resist anymore. I bought a single cig and lighted it. It was so aweful and disguting, and I was consuming with regret. I felt dizzy for a while, and stopped smoking at the half of it.

I feel so bad about what happened. My "clean december" is fucked up, even if I don't plan to smoke another cig again. But who knows, maybe the irresistible urge will come back again... I'm afraid. 

And... should I reset my badge here and my quit date in the app or should I just try to forget about what happened and continue my quitting journey?

Please tell me the fatigue will go away soon.

I did the gum for a week and went cold Turkey off it. It helped with the fatigue but I felt I was getting addicted to it. I've smoked for 15 years
 This last year it went up to a pack to a pack and a half a day. I'm on day 14 after the gum. The fatigue is killing me. I'm hoping this is normal and will go away! Please give me some hope.

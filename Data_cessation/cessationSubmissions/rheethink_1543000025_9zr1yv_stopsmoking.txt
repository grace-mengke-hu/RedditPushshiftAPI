5 days in and anxiety is kicking in hard

Not sure if anyone else feels this way or has felt this way--

Currently 5 days in and I'm panicking right now. I have a huge feeling of dread and anxiety like my life isn't right and everything is going crazy and I'm losing control over myself.

I didn't know this was supposed to happen. In two more days, I will have gone the longest without smoking in almost 10 years. I don't think I can make it, and if I do, I don't know if it will be worth it.

What comes next? Is anything I'm typing make sense to anyone else?

Stopped smoking after 20 + years

On Jan 1 I decided that the game was up. I have smoked for years. Tried NRT, will power Allen Carr hypnsosis the lot. Had varying degrees of success from a couple of weeks to about a year.

I know this is my time I had been planning to knock it on the head. 

8.5 days in and no lapses, handling any cravings that come up. Smoke Free app for iphone is a definite great help.

I know if I even have 1 smoke  I'm back on the hamster wheel to hell

A couple of don'ts for the uninitiated 
Do not preach to smokers - they hate your guts 
Do not boast to people on Social networks 

I have done both of these in the past and it only serves to annoy the hell out of people.

2+ packs a day

I have smoked 2+ packs a day for at least 7 years and started the patch today. I have gone the last 10 hours without a cigarette and have been doing great. My thing is, I have severe insomnia so I spend most of my nights smoking cigarettes and chilling. The last 10 hours without a cigarette has already been a milestone for me. I am craving one so bad and trying so hard not to cave.

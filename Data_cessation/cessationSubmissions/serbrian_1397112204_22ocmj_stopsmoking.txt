Withdrawal a little better, but not by much.

I did a good bit of bitching [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/22i5t8/i_forgot_how_uncomfortable_quitting_can_be/) already, so I'll not go into that again.

Anyway, as mentioned before, I can't remember my last failed quit (the one that lasted 9 months), so I need to ask a couple of things:

1. When am I going to start sleeping properly again? This whole waking up 4 times a night sucks.
2. Since obviously I still have nicotine in my system - I'm still having almost constant cravings after 83 hours, the 72-hour "rule" of having a clean system sounds more and more like bullshit. So... instead of 3 days, what would be a reasonable expectation? 5? Should I drink more water to flush my system out?

On the plus side, my senses of smell and taste are superhuman level now, and I am able to focus a lot better than I was the first few days.

Feedback welcome!

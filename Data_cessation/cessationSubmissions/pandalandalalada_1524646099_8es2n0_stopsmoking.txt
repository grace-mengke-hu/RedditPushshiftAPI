day two

its day two. this morning was ok, did some yoga and relaxed a bit but this afternoon has been a killer. im in work (we work evenings and weekends) getting destracted by wanting to smoke and trying not to talk to anyone becuase i dont want to jinx it.my productivity is  way down. my computer keeps breaking and im doing the breathing exercises someone recomended to stay  calm. just getting through the day. but i havent had a smoke and thats the most important thing.

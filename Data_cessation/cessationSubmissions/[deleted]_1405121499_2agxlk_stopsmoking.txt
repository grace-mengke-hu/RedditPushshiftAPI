How do I get my mother to stop smoking?

My mom just turned 50. She's been a pack a day smoker since I was a child, so 24-25 years old. She's gone through a tremendously difficult time in the past decade. My dad left her for a younger woman when I was 18, and about 4 months later her father died of liver cancer (as a result of heavy alcoholism). As part of the divorce settlement, she got the house, which they valued at a number WAY higher than it's actually worth. She's listed it on and off for the past 4 years but she's been unable to find a buyer. 

Growing up, I never ever saw my mother drink but now she drinks a bottle of wine every night. I know she's wildly depressed because our family falling apart fucked me up, so I can't imagine how painful it's been for her to get older and suffer through these prime years of her life.

I fear that she's dying and I'm watching her die slowly. I hear her cough when I visit, and it keeps her up all night sometimes. She won't listen to me when I beg her to stop, and quite frankly I think a large part of her just wants to be dead. I can see the sadness in her face everyday and I hear it in her voice. I think she's just tired of life and she doesn't really care anymore, but I love her and I want to be there to help her like she was there to help me grow up with a beautiful childhood. I just don't know what the fuck to do in order to help her. Do I send her to therapy? Do I find a psychiatrist to help her with her depression. I'm hoping someone's got some advice.

Over 2 years and I'm happy.

Things have changed in the 2 years since I've quit. I love to run now, something I never thought I would see myself ever doing and my lower body is getting built like a well polished stone. But I've also noticed this new unsightly gut I managed to gain in my down time from running. Fortunately its barely noticeable, but to myself. So now I'll start fine tuning the upper body as well. I also gained 5 more pounds than I ever had in my life. I'm assuming its a mix of new leg muscle and gut. But I do feel better than I've ever felt since before I smoked - some 25+ years ago.  I ran today in 45 degree rain, then later was outside in a t-shirt in a crisp 50 degree weather - Not cold. Crisp. I honestly dont remember a time in my life I could have said that without shivering my ass off in complaint, unless winter had already passed.  

So why am I telling you all this? Whats the point? It has nothing to do with cigarettes.

 That, my friends, is the point. I rarely think about cigarettes unless someone around me is smoking or I see a new thread in /r/stopsmoking . But I'll not pull wool over your eyes. Once in a while there are subtle reminders of my past mistakes, as with all things of our lives. Just today, in fact, I caught myself unconsciously reaching out over the table for my cigarettes. Not because I wanted a cigarette though. It is a burned habit to do that in specific situations. In fact, I suspect some of those habits may have moved over to 'comfort eating' hence the gut. But none of these sideaffects(?) will ever convince me to ever smoke a cigarette. And 2 years in, I have doubts there is anything more that could convince me to make such a mistake. 

I could probably rant forever and probably will fall on deaf ears. So I'll just say you can do this. And it's only as tough as you allow it to be. Mental preparation is your friend. - start with Carr's Easyway to Stop Smoking.

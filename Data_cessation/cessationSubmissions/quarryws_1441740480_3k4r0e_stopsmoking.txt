Hoooollll-eeeeeeeee SHIT!!!

So, you know, I quit smoking yesterday. No big deal. 30 hours cigarette free!  I'm not sure how people around here feel about Chantix, but I just wanted to take a second to sing it's praises. I've quit several times and it's always been really hard for me.  This is the first time I've ever used anything to HELP me quit, and I have to say it's made it 1,000 times more bearable.  Even easy at times.  

I'm also curious to see how many of you had "the thing" happen.  Many of us have been smoking for some time now, and we have all told ourselves we were going to quit, or we decided to quit when our hearts weren't truly in it.  How many of you had "the moment" though?  I did.  My mom came up from Florida last weekend and this woman is a HOT MESS.  She's been smoking for 50 years, drinking for almost as many, and is currently on a cocktail of drugs to treat her cirrhosis, while she continues to drink.  She made my skin crawl, and I decided then and there to not only quit smoking, but to quit drinking as well. I've been sober for 9 days and officially smoke free for a day and a half.  

So what was your "thing"?

Desperately want one now

I'm 380 hours in, my attempts tend to fail at the 100ish hour mark so this one is better than most.

I find the will to quit tends to be very strong at the start but eventually you start to care slightly less. I'm at that point now, been thinking about cigs all day. I'm considering smoking a cigarillo now, just to get that urge out without doing much harm (no inhaling). Just a cigarillo, no inhaling, how does that sound?

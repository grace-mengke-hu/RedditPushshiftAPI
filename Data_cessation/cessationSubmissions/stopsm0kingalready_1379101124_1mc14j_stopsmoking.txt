This is so dumb

I just really want to rant. I had to create a throwaway account because a ton of my friends monitor my reddit usage (creepy, I know.) 

I had a really successful quit near the beginning of this year. I had quit for almost 5 months (i believe it was 4 months 3 weeks). I was to the point where I wasn't thinking about smoking all that often. Maybe once or twice a week. But I started again because my boyfriend gave up quitting (we did it together) and I didn't have the willpower to stick with it. It started with one single smoke because I "just felt like it."

For the last couple of months I have been smoking just 2-4 cigs a day. Hence my "this is so dumb" title. Some days I'd even do really good and smoke just 1. LOL. Why not just quit altogether? I swear that I'm just scared to quit again or something. Almost as if that post-work smoke is really that strong of a thing. But it's all in my head. I go from when I wake up until about 7 p.m. (when I get off) without any because I only smoke my boyfriend's cigs. What is it about me that says I HAVE to have one when I get home from work? My brain must think it's a reward or something.

I'm so done with this! When I look at what cigarettes really are I'm dumbfounded that anyone could be addicted to them, paper wrapped in arsenic and rat poison and other mysterious substances, as well as tobacco and nicotine. Really? That's what's been hijacking your brain since you were 17? Say no to highjacking!!!

Edit: I think I'm going to log into this account whenever I need to rant, it'd be a great motivator to not pick a cigarette up.

Going to chew my last two pieces of nicorette (one today one tomorrow), read the Carr book and then sweat the rest of the withdrawal out of me by going to the gym.

New Quitter. Feeling Sick as a Dog :(

Hi All,

I quit just over a week ago. Mainly because of external factors (people coming to see me that don't know I smoke) but I'm keeping it up and had thought a lot about quitting. 

The only problem here is that I now have a KILLER sore throat (part of the reason I quit because I kept getting tonsilitus and wheezy breath @30 years old).

Its sort of a dry sore throat with some phlegm. I suppose I should go to the doctor but it only started yesterday and I'm hoping to just ride it out. 

My partner a doctor and she reckons its just the stopping smoking. Suppose I'm just coming to the community for a bit of reassurance and to have a general whinge.

Thanks for listening to my little story.

5 days, need tips

I (20/f) have been smoking for a year now and decided to quit cold turkey just so I could save some money. I wasn't a heavy smoker to begin with, maybe half a pack a day. I smoked Black American Spirits. The first few days were tough. I had splitting headaches and I was super irritable. This is day number 5 for me and so far, I have had no headache.  

My problem for me is, smoking was my escape, if you will. Need a break at work? Smoke. Break from school? Smoke. Got done with that episode from Netflix? Smoke. Now that I don't smoke, what do I do? What is my "escape"? I need something to occupy my mind. 

On a sidenote, what has really helped me and been my driving motivation, was I told practically everyone I saw that I was quitting. Mostly all my co workers were very supportive and now everyday a few of them will ask, "did you smoke yet?" It's almost like I don't want to let them down, or I want to prove anyone who says I won't last, wrong. Maybe I'm stubborn.

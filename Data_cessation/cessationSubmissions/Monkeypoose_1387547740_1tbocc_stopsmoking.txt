Today I am quitting, support appreciated!

I have a horrible drunk smoking addiction and I've tried to kick it before to no avail. I live in New York City where the temptation is unavoidable and giving up drinking for a time period is also nearly impossible. I think I can do this but any tips or just encouragement would be great!! Thanks so much guys!

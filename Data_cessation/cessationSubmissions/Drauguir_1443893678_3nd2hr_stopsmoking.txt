Shitty boring night, drunk as hell...but didn't smoke (bittersweet hangover)

Well, I just wanted to say that I won over one of the worst triggers in this universe: drinking alcohol. And it was a shitty night too. I've just realized that I'm getting tired of alcohol too. Does this happen to some of you, too? I feel like I'm in my best when I'm sober.

Trying to visualize myself a non-smoker (day4)

Hi guys, it’s day 4 for me and I’m trying hard to rememeber how I felt about cigarettes when I was a non-smoker. 

I was smoking around 5 cigarettes/day for about 5 years. I keep thinking “now or never” but I don’t know if I’m strong enough yet. 

Does it get better? If so, then when?

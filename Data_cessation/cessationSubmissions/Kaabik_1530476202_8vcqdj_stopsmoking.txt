Quitting for the second time

I had previously stopped smoking for a couple of months after I became worried about my health (was smoking for a couple of years by that time). Recently started again during a party where I ended up chain smoking 30g of tobacco. I've now decided to stop for good so as to maintain my health. Smoking has done only harm to those closest to me. My grandmother chain smokes and her deterioration is clearly visible. It genuinely makes me want to steer clear of it and pursue a more healthy life style.

Only thing that really worries me is relapsing, particularly during the next couple of weeks when I go on holiday with some friends (most of whom smoke). I like to think that I have decent self control but it's stressing me out thinking that I'll end up getting caught in the cycle.

day 10: when does the gunk come up?

my energy has skyrocketed and my breathing is obviously way better, but i'm noticing a bit of wheezing and tiny coughing fits. is there a point where the coughing gets super bad and all the lung sludge starts to expel? i'm ready to get all this nasty shit out of me - me and cigarettes are OVER!

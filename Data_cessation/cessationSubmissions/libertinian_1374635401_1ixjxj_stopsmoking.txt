I'm drunk and watching a tv show heavily focused on smoking... I can feel the cigarette in my hand again...

But I'm still okay :)

I do want one now, but the happiness not smoking brings me is bigger now. It's a good feeling. 

It's been a couple months since I've felt an urge, and this one is so much easier to recover from than all the last ones. All the good things that come from not smoking keep getting better, and all the "pleasures" from smoking keep becoming less significant. 

And it's really nice to have this subreddit to vent to. Everyone here is so nice and helpful.

**the show is "How I Met Your Mother" Season 5, Episode 11: Last Cigarette ever**

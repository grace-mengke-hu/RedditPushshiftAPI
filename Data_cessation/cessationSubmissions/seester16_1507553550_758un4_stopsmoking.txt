Day 1 - Let's do this! 💪🏼

Does anybody want to be an accountability buddy? 

Today is day 1 for me. For some reason the patch doesn't want to stick so I have several bandaids holding it on in an extremely fashionable way 🤣. 

My craving plans:
-flavored toothpicks 
-gum
-lollipops
-walking or kickboxing video 

This is the second time that I have quit. Last time was for two years and I started back after my Dad passed. I can't believe it took me two years to be ready to try again but here I am. 

The last time I quit I ended up picking up crocheting which worked wonders but I was horrible at it. I'm hoping my diversion plans will work or I might be making scarfs for everybody!

Just found out I have bad gingivitis, I need to quit nicotine

So my teeth have been bleeding when I brush them recently. I went to the dentist today to see what was up and apparently I have pretty bad gingivitis that may develop into Periodontitis. My dental hygiene isn't great, but it's not terrible, I brush my teeth 2 times a day. A likely cause is the amount of nicotine I consume. Apparently nicotine creates less bloodflow to the gums which makes bacteria more able to cause plaque and gum disease.

I'm only 21, and my shit is already catching up to me. Like usually in the PSA things you see people with dentures who are like 40 or 50, this is nuts. Not to be dramatic, I prob wont lose my teeth if I keep good oral hygiene and cut down, but the amount of nicotine I consume is certainly having a negative effect. I don't smoke cigs very much, mostly 2-3 a day, but I chain vape whenever I can, and I imagine I get through a ton of nicotine.

I have an online summer class that I'm doing for my college that's like really sped up and I don't think I can go without nicotine but I will cut down. I know now how much I'm destroying my body. Shit's scary.

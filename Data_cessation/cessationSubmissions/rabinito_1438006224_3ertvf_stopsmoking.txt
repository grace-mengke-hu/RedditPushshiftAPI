365!

Good time to come here and say thanks to the great /r/stopsmoking community. By far the most effective tool I had at my disposal when I decided to quit 365 days ago!

If you're just starting, keep at it. I know it's hard, but I swear it gets easier. And you'll feel so much better that it's worth any effort you're putting.

If you're thinking of quitting, just do it. It's not easy and you'll have a few rough days, but soon enough your only regret will be not having quit earlier.

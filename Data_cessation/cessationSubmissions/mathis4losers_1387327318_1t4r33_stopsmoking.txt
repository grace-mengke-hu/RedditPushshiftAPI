My urge to have a cigarette doesn't go away...

I seem to easily be able to quit smoking for 2 or 3 days.  The problem is that the urge doesn't go away.  The first time I quit was for 6 months and I wanted a cigarette the whole time.  I know my triggers are driving, social situations, and coffee, but I can't stay out of these situations for months.  

I haven't had a cigarette for 48 hours and would really like this to be the last time I quit but I'm worried the urge won't go away.  Any advice?

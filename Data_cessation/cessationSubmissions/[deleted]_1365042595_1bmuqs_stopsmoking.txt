I realize this might be a r/relationships question, but I thought I might get better advice here. My SO is kind of bad at being supportive while I quit.

I've been smoking 1/2 a pack to a pack a day for 5 years. I feel like it's time to quit, but like you guys know quitting cold turkey can be incredibly difficult and getting through the first days is ridiculously hard. 

My quit day was monday, and Im ashamed to admit that I didnt even last a day. But! Instead of smoking atleast 10 cigs, I only smoked 3. Same for the last 2 days. He asked me about it today, and I told him that I "hadn't been doing well, but I've only smoked a few cigs since monday so I feel proud about that" and also that I was going to start reading Alan Carr's book (a classmate recommended it, and I know you guys are fans too) and that it recommends you keep smoking till a certain point in the book. 

He started laughing and just said, "It sounds like another excuse, like 'i'll start tomorrow' or 'once i finish this pack'...I just dont think you're going to do it"

It was really hurtful, and it certainly didnt help me or motivate me at all. I'm going to talk to him about it tomorrow. 

So my question is, when you guys quit was this the reaction you got from a lot of people? If so, how did you handle it? To me it seems very unhelpful, but maybe I'm just being...sensitive? I guess I'm just asking if this is was "support" looks like or if you guys received something else as support. 

Anything is appreciated, thanks guys.

Craving it right now.

I haven't smoked in 2 days. A buddy of mine just gave me a pack of smokes. My goal is not necessarily to quit, but to at least wane myself down a bit, as i was up to smoking 1/3 a pack every day. I know this is not much to all of you, but i can see the slippery slope that i could easily fall down. 

It is difficult not to smoke when you have cigarettes waiting for you.

This time is different

I've quit smoking on numerous occasions before. I became extremely irritable and basically was a complete ass to everyone around me. Almost lost my job once because of it. 

This is time however has been completely different. I'm not experiencing any cravings, I just feel sick. Like I have the flu. Extremely tired, hot and cold flashes, throwing up, etc. 

Why is this time different from all the rest? Is this normal and will it go away soon?

Update: So as an experiment, I smoked a cigarette today and the about halfway through I felt better so I was just going through withdrawals. I will reset my tag when I get home from work.

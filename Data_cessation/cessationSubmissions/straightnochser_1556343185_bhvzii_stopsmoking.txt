One moment could ruin everything

Day 4: My first ever reddit post. 

Just had my sibling show up. Who is not doing well and is homeless. Had to make the hard decision to not let him stay. As he showed up with someone I didn’t know. My daughter’s birthday is today and once she went bed I had planned to set up her gift and balloons. And then he showed up. And I’m triggered to smoke. I’m upset and I’m crying. And I’m wondering what’s the point of trying to be healthy. Why am I trying to be better. I am dying for a smoke. He even asks me for some and I tell him I quit. And I can’t tell if he thinks I’m lying. Despite all this I haven’t smoked. It’s now been 4 whole days going on 5. It’s so hard but one moment of feeling like I don’t deserve to basically live or be happy and I could be smoking right now. I’m going to try to let these feelings pass but it feels impossible right now.

89 hours smoke free

I made the decision to quit while staying with a chainsmoking family in a country where cigarettes are $3/pack. If I can make this work, surely it should be easier when I get back. 

First day was pretty bad but I'm finding it a little easier each day. 

Every time I have an inkling of a craving I just tell myself "I'm not a smoker anymore!" -- this seems to be the most effective thing I've done so far. I've smoked for 12 years or so and quit once for about ~6 months. 

I really want to smoke out of boredom these days, but instead have taken up getting to 10k steps a day, so I refocus craving energy there instead.

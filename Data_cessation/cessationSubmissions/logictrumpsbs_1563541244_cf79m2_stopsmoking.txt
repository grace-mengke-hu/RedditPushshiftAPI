How are you sleeping after quitting?

I quit on monday. I havent been able to sleep well since then. I toss and turn, I never fully reach REM or I don't stay there long. I up every few hours glancing at the clock I just can't seem to get a good nights sleep. Im certain this will wear off but does anyone else go though this?

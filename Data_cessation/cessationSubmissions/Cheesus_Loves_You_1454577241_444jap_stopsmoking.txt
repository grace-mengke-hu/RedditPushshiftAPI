In it to win it!

Hi r/stopsmoking :)

Sorry for the cheesy title. I have been a lurker for quite a while but since I'm really and seriously wanting to be a non smoker this time around I figured it was time to post here.
I am a 20 year pack a day smoker. I actually quit for almost a whole year in 2013 but then an overseas move got a little too stressful. I loved the feeling of non smoking, the lower blood pressure, not smelling like cigarrettes, no caughing and so on. I love running and working out and not feeling like I'm dying. I didn't smoke for two weeks right around the holidays but then I had a problem with my parents and I smoked again. I was doing so good up until then! I actually generally have no physical problems when I quit so I don't do NRT. It's more the habitual stuff. Boredom or stress will make me want to smoke. I read the Allen Carr book twice. I know all this stuff by heart. I know I can do it. 
So here goes day one. I figure if I write or read here when I'm having an issue it will really help. 

Thank you so much for reading :)



Ps. How to I get a counter next to my name? Or is that the badge you have to send a message to a bot for? Sorry I'm relatively new to this.

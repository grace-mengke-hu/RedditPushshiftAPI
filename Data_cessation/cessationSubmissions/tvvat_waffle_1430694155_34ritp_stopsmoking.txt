I quit today

Ooooohhhh it's gonna be hard. My boyfriend and my best friend are both heavy smokers. Me, I've been smoking for seven years- since I was thirteen. I'd like to make it through my twenties with all my teeth and both my lungs. This is the first day I've gone without smoking in roughly 2 years. It used to be 10 or more cigarettes a day. I can't believe I've even made it to 6pm with just a few hits off of a Mark10. Wheeew. Wish me luck. If any one can offer advice and tips, and anything I should be expecting in the next few days (health changing-wise) I'd really appreciate it.  Thank you guys for being an inspiring reddit community.

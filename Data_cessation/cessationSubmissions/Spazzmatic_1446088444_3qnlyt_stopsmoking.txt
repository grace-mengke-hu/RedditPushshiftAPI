Voicemail:"(Your name), this is Dr. Jones' office. Your test results are back and we have noticed an irregularity on your lung. Come in right away."

I have 2 friends that got a call like that. One had part of her lung removed. She's still alive. The other died. Oddly, his wife continued to smoke even after he died. Both were 59. Let this be the wake-up "call" that motivates you to save your life so you never have to deal with the stress a call like this might cause you. You can do it!!

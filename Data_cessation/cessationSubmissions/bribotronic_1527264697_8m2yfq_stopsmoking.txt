I’m gaining weight

I’m a 28 year old woman, and I smoked a pack a day for about 10 years. I quit 25 days ago, and I’m enjoying all of the benefits (not smelling bad, having more time to do stuff, being able to breathe without pain.) However, I’ve been putting on weight. I’ve already gained about 5 lbs (which, in less than a month, is pretty significant.) At first I wasn’t worrying about overeating as long as it kept me from smoking, but I really don’t want to continue to put on weight.
Does anyone have any tips or experience with this post-quit weight gain?

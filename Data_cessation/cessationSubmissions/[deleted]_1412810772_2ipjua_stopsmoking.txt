10 months strong, but I'm feeling very weak today.

So today has been extremely stressful and I'm not going to lie, shoving a cig in my mouth sounds really lovely right now and I decided that I'm going to ignore the impulse to run to the gas station and just rant here for a minute. 

I thought that these cravings would go away by now.. I guess it's a mental battle from here on out. I was a smoker for 10 years, and my "go-to" coping mechanism was smoking, and I never replaced it with anything healthy. I think I need to start jogging or something..

Anyway, today was shit. Everyone is pissed off at me or pissing me off and I have like 50 overdue bills (really only like 3) and a pain in the ass roomy that constantly stiffs me on their share of things and then I end up in trouble because my name is on the accounts and I'm just really fucking sick of people being useless pieces of shit and I really want to smoke. FUCK.

So how was your day? :)

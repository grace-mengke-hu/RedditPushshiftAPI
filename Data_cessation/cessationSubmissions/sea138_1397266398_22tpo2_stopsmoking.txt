Giving up smoking while studying? What can I replace it with?

Hi! 

So, I have recently started smoking again after promising my boyfriend I'll give up. 

I study from home so I can sit around in my PJ's, make food and tea, super quiet pretty area and have power naps whenever.

I stop every hour or 2 or if I need time to really think about something and go have a smoke, its the only thing I find relaxing during that time and it helps me think/clears my head.

We're trying to save money and get healthier so its really nipping those two in the bud... (and the obvious deceiving).

Are there any tips or ideas to replace the cigarettes with something else that could be just as satisfying?! Or do I need to take some concrete pills and harden up...

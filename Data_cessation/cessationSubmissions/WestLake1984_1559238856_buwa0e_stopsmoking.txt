14 days smoke free today!

Just a few improvements I've noticed so far: 

Don't have that nasty tight chested feeling and shortness of breath anymore.
Need significantly less sleep to feel well rested.
Skin looks and feels healthier.
Digestive problems improved by 100%.
Generally much more energy.
Women seem more into me now I don't stink like an ashtray.
My mental state has improved significantly; less stress, depression and anxiety.

All this after just two weeks! I'll post an update when I reach one month, stay strong and thanks for the support!

Detoxing along with quitting

I decided to support my coworker and start a 10 day detox. Figured i would give a final shot at quitting smoking. What i noticed is that so far my cravings have been significantly reduced compared to my previous attempts. Caffeine seems to be the toughest at the moment. I think i can do it now. Any one else notice this? Also, i have major snot! Spitting loogies like i have a cold.

This is my third day checkin. What am I doing up already?

Last two days have been kinda hard, there's been lot of temptation, stayed strong though. Now for the second day I'm up early, what's that all about, does my body need less sleep now, or did the monster wake me?

Anyways, almost 60 hours nicotine free, and today's a workout day again, so there should be enough opportunities to get that excess energy out of the system.

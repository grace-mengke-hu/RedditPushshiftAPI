Triggers On Day 26 (A very few hours away from Day 27)

This is how insidious triggers are:  Today as I was walking to my office from the bus stop, I took a slightly different route than usual and walked by an old haunt of mine where you can drink AND smoke – in a City where you can’t smoke in bars.  It’s actually a cigar bar, but also serves alcohol.  You can also get away with smoking a cigarette there.  Anyway, I get about one-half block away from this place and I can smell the smoke!  Mostly cigar smoke hanging in the outside air.

I’m on Day 26, so you’d think, no problem, right?  My first thought – irrationally, I might add – was “Oh, I can just stop off there and have a glass of wine and a smoke.”  You guys – I was on my way to work.  I do not drink before I go to work.  Nor did I have any real interest in going there for a glass of wine and a smoke.  But the thought was THAT STRONG … it just took over for about five seconds and I was actually almost considering that somehow I could do this very irrational thing on my way to work.  

I kept walking to work, and it hit me a few blocks later:  that’s how it all starts.  There’s a trigger, especially a “good” association, and some track in our mind thinks it’s a good idea to pursue smoking a cigarette.  The thought was irrational though.  I was literally dumbfounded as I thought about it and how insidious the addiction is, how the urges/cravings/thoughts to smoke seem so “right” at the time, how our minds process something so toxic in ways that seem rewarding.
  
There’s nothing about smoking that’s rewarding.  In fact, it is an addiction that costs us dearly in money spent and increased health risks due to smoking.

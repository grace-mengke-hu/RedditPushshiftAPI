Does it get easier?

Tonight will be the two week mark since I have smoked a cigarette. Although the cravings happen less often and I think about smoking less often, it is still there. Sometimes it lasts for s long time and all I think about is smoking. It sounds like the greatest thing in the world. It's taking some serious will power to keep me from smoking. My question is does this get any easier? Do these cravings become less intense and not as often?

Going on day 2, having weird feelings.

Not sure what it is about but I've been having an excited type feeling in my body, its almost like i'm itching with an excitement for something however i'm not really happy/excited for anything. Has anyone experienced this? Thankfully outside of that feeling I haven't had any real serious cravings yet however my mood and anger management have been absolute shit, i'm hoping they don't get too bad.

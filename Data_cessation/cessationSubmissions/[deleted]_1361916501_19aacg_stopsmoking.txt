Girlfriend is going to try and stop smoking. What are some ways I can help support her?

I know this can be a very delicate process. I quit too, but I was never a serious smoker ( pack ever couple of days for about a year) but she has been smoking for 20+ years. I read somewhere that it is important not to beat yourself up if you smoke while trying to quit, because its a process, but what other things should I know, or look into, to be able to help?

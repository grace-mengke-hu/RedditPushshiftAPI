In 2 hours, it will be 1 week nicotine free!

I'm very happy to have come this far. The first few days were hell on earth, but since yesterday it has gotten progressively better.

I decided to quit cold turkey (heavy smoker for 3 years) after my grandmother (heavy smoker for over 50 years) was told she has a 50/50 chance of having lung cancer. We still don't know if she does or not as the results are still yet to come, but I promised myself I would never touch another cigarette ever again.

I don't want to use an e-cig or patches or gum, as I want my body to be completely nicotine free. I still feel a bit sluggish and weak, but hoping that will subside very soon. 

Thanks to this awesome community for helping me through it, you guys rock!

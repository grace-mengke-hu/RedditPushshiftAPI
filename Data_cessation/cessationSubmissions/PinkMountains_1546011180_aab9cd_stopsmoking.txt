I promise you’ll think of smoking a lot less soon

It’s been 166 days and I’ve been contemplating the question that was on my mind for at least the first 90 days... will I ever stop thinking about it? 

- I think the temptation will be there for a long time. When I see smoking in movies or tv (basically glorified usage) I still think aw man I wish I could smoke! Then I remind myself that I don’t really want to, because it’s not as great as it seemed.

- I don’t think about it barely ever otherwise! I only get a craving if I’m breaking a habit. Basically, if I’m doing something for the first time since quitting that I’d usually smoke. 

I’m also feeling thankful that I finally quit! It seems like a lifetime ago, because getting rid of it does change your life for the better. You really can do this, and the age old wisdom still tracks: not one more puff!

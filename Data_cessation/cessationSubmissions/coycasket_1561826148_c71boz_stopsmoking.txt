I don't know how to be accountable to myself when it comes to quiting/smokingâ€‹

I quit once before years ago for 6 months. This past year I quit for about 4 +/-  but have fallen back in. I don't know how to stay accountable to just myself so now I'm here looking for some type of venue to help me stick to it, or to go to when I feel like breaking. I hate myself every time I light up, I physically feel weak and like I'm killing myself. Can't do it anymore.

But what do you replace the habit with to cope with anxiety?

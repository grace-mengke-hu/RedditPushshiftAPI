Quit smoking. Have previously quit other substances. Any input appreciated.

Hi everyone. I had my last cigarette 48 hours ago. I have been sober since March 2015. I have been clean from a cocaine addiction since June 2013. 

I'm feeling pretty strong in my resolve to not smoke again. I'm not feeling all that obsessive about needing to go outside and smoke. I'm feeling a little antsy, but I know I'm not going to smoke and utilizing tools that I learned from quitting other substances to this. 

I'm wondering if other users who have previously quit drinking or drugs could share their experience in quitting cigarettes? Did you find it harder to quit smoking? Was it easier? 

I'm just wondering if how I'm feeling is that "pink cloud" that you can get after quitting drinking. I feel pretty strong about not smoking again. Anybody else that can comment would be really appreciated. 

Thank you!

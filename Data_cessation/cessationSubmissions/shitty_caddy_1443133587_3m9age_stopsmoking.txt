My sister was just diagnosed with Stage 2 throat cancer. I'm done, it's Day 1

I just got the news my sister who smokes was diagnosed with stage 2 throat cancer and I'm in shock. I went outside, had one last smoke and then ripped up every single cigarette and threw away all my lighters. Here's to day 1 guys.

Vaping question

I was smoking a little over a pack a day, reds if that matters. I quit cold turkey..  but I miss the hand to mouth fix, ya know? I'm just curious what you all think, I have a vape, and 0mg nicotine... smoking the 0 doesn't give me any nicotine but it does stop the desperation I'm feeling to take a drag.   

Would you say I'm cheating? Or am I still on track? I feel like a cheater 🙁 even though it has no nicotine in it. 
Thanks.

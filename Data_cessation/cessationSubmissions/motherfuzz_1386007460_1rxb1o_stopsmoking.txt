3 Months!

Today is officially my 3 month mark!

I've been doing this completely cold turkey, and this is definitely not the first time I've tried. The only thing I've done differently this time around is use this subreddit as a support group, so I think I can scientifically say that you guys are the best thing to happen to my health in a long time!!

I know that quitting is a never-ending fight. I still get the cravings from time to time, however, after making it this far and having you guys behind me, I feel really confident that I'm done smoking for good!

So, I guess I just wanted to check-in and say thanks guys! This is sort of a big day for me, and it's largely because of you. 
Keep being awesome!!

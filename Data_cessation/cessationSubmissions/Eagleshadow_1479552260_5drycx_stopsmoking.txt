Best ways to provide support?

My new girlfriend is trying to quit smoking. I've never had any physical addiction of any kind myself so it's hard to understand what quitting is like for her, except that its hard. Do you guys have any advice on how to best support her and help her get through this? Like for example, when she relapses a bit, is it better to act disappointed with her as in negative reinforcement in order to help, or is it preferable to be forgiving and caring and help her feel better since she's feeling bad about it.


Edit: My question has been answered, thanks guys. Having read your perspectives and having thought about this some more I now see clearly that trying to help her via negative reinforcement, would be a clear boundary issue on my part, and is an absolute no-no. Luckily I much prefer not doing that and simply being supportive, as I do love her so hurting her even a little, even if it was meant to help, would be unpleasant for me as well.
 But this fact (not wanting to be jerk on an emotional level) is in itself a bias, which is why I went and asked you guys how you would have preferred your partners acted in such a situation, just in case.

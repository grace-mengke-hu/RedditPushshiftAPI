5th attempt to quit smokes.

Prior to 2 days ago, I have attempted and failed to drop this dirty habbit on 4 occasions. I have tried a few different methods, from cutting back to cold turkey, but this is the first time I have tried with medical assistance. My doctor recommended Champix to me, which is a pill Nicotine suppliment. and I am feeling great about this attempt already. 

Lately I have hated every smoke I have lit up. I stand out in the cold winter air away from my friends/family/colleagues, the taste and smell has been disgusting me for weeks, and I hate the feeling of being dependent on these toxins. It was only last night that I became so confident, as I had friends over that were chain smoking, and I declined every offer they gave me for a ciggy. 

I have come here because it looks like a great way to track progress, and reading everyones stories has made me that much more confident that I can drop this habbit!

FYI: I have been smoking for 4 years now, and get through a 50G pouch of rolling tobacco in a week. perhaps 12-15 a day.

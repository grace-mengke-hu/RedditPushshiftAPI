How i became slave again

I made quit in oct2017. And I was not smoking till 3jan2018. 

My gf had a severe angina, I was depressed and lonely. I also was in Vietnam and everybody around were smoking... everywere. I new the day before 2jan2018 that i am going to surrender. I drove to the shop, bought that crazy asian cigarrets and inhale nicotine. 
I new that it will start the chain of smoking. 
And i am sitting here, writing this post, trying to get bravery to make a new attempt, and understanding that that idea was so fucking dumb. 

Dont make mistakes. That shit doesnt help, there in no good in cigarets. Only sorrow, and slavery.

still have morning craving on day 30

I smoked a helluva long time (37 years) and heaviest in the mornings.
My cravings are mostly gone, except for early morning.
I vape a 0mg tobacco flavor juice to help out in the mornings.
I want to quit vaping by the end of August, so hopefully these early morning cravings will subside by then.

580 cigarettes not smoked - $130.50 saved.

We can do this folks !

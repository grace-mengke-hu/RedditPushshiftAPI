Perforated Appendix

Just got out to the hospital about a week ago. After the surgery breathing was a bit rough. I know that if I hadn't quit smoking it would be much worse. Just another benefit from quitting. For those of you just starting out on your quit, there are sooo many benefits that you will get along the way and some really nice unexpected ones like this. I know I am also recovering quicker as I am not putting toxins in my body daily. You can do this.

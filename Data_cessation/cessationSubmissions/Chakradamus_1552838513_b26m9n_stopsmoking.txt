From cold turkey to empowerment of the mind body and soul

Day 11.5 for me only smoke free and I am so glad I did it! 10 years since my first puff today and I am happy to say I didn’t make it to the 10 year mark. 

The first 3 days were tough, than came the 4th day and each day forward has been easier, less cravings and I have been finding myself not having to remind myself “You are no longer a smoker, stop thinking like that” it just is my new life! Smoke free. 

I give my thanks to the Smoke Free app but honestly couldn’t have done this without my girlfriend.

I gave her an ultimatum... Stop drinking or I am done. My mother is a big drinker, always has been and the last thing I want is my lady to be drinking the same, forgetting things... I just cannot and could not live like that. I gave my girlfriend the ultimatum that we stop drinking, and I’ll stop smoking for her if she does that. I explained how building sober memories was very important to me, and alcohol can be many people’s ultimate demise so I just knew what I wanted in my future. The fact I loved my girlfriend, we worked together. She loves me too thank god. Started off very rough, but we are both just about at the two week mark. Hoping we keep going strong!

GAMETIME

No more false starts... I've had too many of those.
No more excuses... I've made even more of those.
No more disappointments and letting myself down... it's all thats ever on my mind.

I NEED TO QUIT. I AM DESPERATE.

My throats hurts with every drag.
My lungs grasp for air that doesn't pass as well as it used to.
My physical condition is at it's all time lowest.

All I can think is puffing myself to diabetes, or heart disease, or high blood pressure. 

Every cigarette I smoke constantly reminds me of how I am drawing closer to an early grave.  

I can't stand having to lie to my family and hide it anymore. I can't live with this guilt. 

Starting NOW I am done... I've worked my way up to this point. I finally had the courage to do this thing, once and for all.

I need your help Reddit. I'm desperate. I feel lower about this than I ever have. 

Please offer any advice you have.

I'm sorry for the rant... I just can't take it anymore.

Question about smoking in general.

I have been smoking for almost twelve years and recently attempted for the eighteenth time to quit for good.

After so many past failures and rapidly declining health due to asthma, sleep apnea, weight issues and smoking, I have taken the path of least resistance and gotten an e-cig.

Everything is going great, I feel way better in the morning, I barely use my pumps anymore, and all in all I feel more happy in general.

However, every so often I fall. I get stressed at work and bum a smoke of a colleague and it tastes like shit and I hate it. But I wonder, how bad is that one cigarette health wise? Is having that one a week ruining everything that I am trying to fix? Are my lungs unable to heal because every so often I have a smoke? I know that I need to stop 100%, but it is so easy to justify one every so often or a few with some drinks, but I'm really curious as to how much I'm setting myself back.

Anybody have an answer?

Frustration

I have not smoked since Thursday but I started getting frustrated a few hours ago because I was surrounded by friends who smoke. I felt so frustrated but wouldn't want to break the streak. I was pissed for an hour straight and I felt like shit. I'm glad I didn't break my streak but I still feel frustrated about it.

Today's the day

I'm going to do it. Going to stop smoking cigarettes. No more excuses. I'm sick of waking up in the morning and my first thought being a cigarette. Sick of grabbing a pack before the end of the night because I'm nervous about going without one when I wake up. Sick of wasting money and buying cigarettes instead of food when I'm running low on money. I'm done being scared. I went 18 years without one. Sick of the smell, sick of people being grossed out by the habit. Sick of cigarettes running my life. My chest hurts and I'm done. Sorry for the rant, had to tell someone.

Day 1

Hey all, finished reading Easyway yesterday, had my last cigarette before bed last night and feel like I am doing pretty well today. Scared of gaining weight, but that's something I will keep an eye on and try to work out and eat well. I found Easyway has been a motivator and given me good reasons to quit mentally, I'm hoping the reasons are still as clear as time goes on and I face the worst of the withdrawal and the different situations that arise. Hoping my badge from the bot goes through, and glad to join the non-smokers :)

If you fail. Forgive yourself.

It's hard quitting smoking for some of us. I have smoked since I was 16 and been a full time smoker since I was 18. To think of the thousands of dollars I have paid into such a bad habit almost had me crying. I could of gone to Europe or India or any where else in the world of the price I have paid for smoking. 

I have tried so many quit attempts. Patches, lozenges, cold turkey...you get the idea, I have tried at least 2-3 times a year to quit. Take it with a grain of salt but I read my horoscope on new years when I was blitzed out of my mind and it said this is the year for me to get healthy and take on a new meaning in life. I have read Alan Carrs book and reread it, but I'm ready to try again and this time actually take it to heart to quit. 

I want to be healthy, save money, whiten my teeth, so many benefits to not smoking, this is my final badge reset, tomorrow I will wake up a non smoker. I do not plan on failing this time, but just remember if you do, forgive yourself, its ok to make mistakes. You can always try again. Guess this was more for myself but meh I could use some moral support.

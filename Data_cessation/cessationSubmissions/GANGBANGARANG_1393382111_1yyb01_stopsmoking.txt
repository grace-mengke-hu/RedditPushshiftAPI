Cold turkey starting now!

I promised myself I'd quit once I finished this pack and I just had my last smoke. I'm anticipating a difficult few days, certainly, but I've managed a month+ at a time and the difference now is that I've got some real conviction and people supporting me. I've only been smoking for a couple years so I can seriously respect the people who have quit a lifelong habit and stuck with it.

Wish me luck! I'm considering an ecig but I wanna make it out of the woods first.

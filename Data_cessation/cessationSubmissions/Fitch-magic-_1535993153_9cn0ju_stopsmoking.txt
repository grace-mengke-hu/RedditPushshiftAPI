Mom caught me smoking...

She knows I smoke but I always feel like shit when she catches me with a smoke. I didn't have anymore cigarettes left so I got irritated with myself and put on a patch! I dunno if this will last... I don't think my intention is that solid. But I'm super irritated with myself... While in the shower I gave myself a pep talk and PATCH ON!

Can't even fucking remember what number attempt this is.

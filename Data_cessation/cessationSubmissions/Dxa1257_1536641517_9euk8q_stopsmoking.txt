4 Weeks, A week more and this is going to be my best attempt so far!!

I completed 4 weeks today. Interestingly last night in my dreams, i was smoking a single cigarette and i did not enjoy it. Also i was in a conflict with myself because i had to reset my flair. The flair option in this sub and this sub overall is one of the many reasons why i am able to pull it off.[progress pic](https://i.imgur.com/3OElVqX.png)

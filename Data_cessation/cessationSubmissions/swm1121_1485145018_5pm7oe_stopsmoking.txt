Tomorrow is the day I quit. I've been wanting to quit for so long and when I succeed at quitting I will get to keep my wonderful girlfriend.

Friday I got mad at my girlfriend via text and she tried to console me. Eventually she said "when I get home we will talk." I've heard that once in the past and knew it was a break up coming. She came home Friday night and coldly said "I don't see a future with you." After a weekend spent drinking and crying I told her I would change anything to keep her. She really just wants to be healthy and we enable each other to drink and smoke. Each time one of us tries to quit one of our vices the other isn't committed to quitting and we allow each other to break our commitment. I got her to agree to stay if I quit drinking and smoking and start working out and living healthy. After much begging she finally agreed. Only problem was I said I would do it in a heartbeat. I planned to have a week or so to get ready but apparently tomorrow is the day we quit smoking. I normally don't like ultimatums but this is something I've always wanted to do and I feel like it's a fair trade. I know we will both be short and moody the first few days but at least I know each time I crave a cigarette I'm choosing between a happy healthy life with her or spending more money on a habit I hate and smelling like smoke. I know I shouldn't do it for anyone but myself but this is something I've always wanted to do and there is something to actually be gained by succeeding. I just hope this is a successful quit and I can be done with cigarettes forever. Please don't tell me that I need to do this for myself. I am. I just now have something to lose if it's not successful whereas I didn't before. I hope the thought of being with her and being healthy can overcome any cravings. All tips are appreciated. I feel like I'll do better by sharing this with many that have the same goal.

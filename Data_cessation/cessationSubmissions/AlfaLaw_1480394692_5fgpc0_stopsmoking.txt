Concentration issues.

Hi, fellow quitters.

I quit smoking on August 4, 2016. I feel a bit better, and the cravings are much less intense and frequent.

I, however, have absolutely no concentration. It has become extremely difficult for me to concentrate. I am now studying for finals and, for the life of me, I forget stuff as soon as I learn it. Good thing the exams are open book and I make guides with what I have been studying. Even then, I am fearing for the worst.

I can have "moments" of clarity in which I can actually concentrate and it feels great, but those are rare.

Is this normal? I feel completely non-functional. Will it go away? Should I see someone?

Thank you.

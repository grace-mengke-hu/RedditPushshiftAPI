I did quit for 3 years, now I am back due to unemployment. but today I do it again.

*English is my second language, sorry if there is any grammatical mistakes.*

&amp;nbsp;

I am going to keep this short and simple, and I am writing this to motivate my-self to stop this filthy habit again. 

&amp;nbsp;

When I first started smoking officially and became addicted to nicotine it was back in 2011, when I was living in the states, I don't know why, I guess I thought it was a way to cope with my loneliness even though I was 21!! and that shit is expensive here. 

&amp;nbsp;

Went back to my country and it was an off and on habit until I joined a gym and started working with a personal trainer and working out 6 times a week, I officially stopped in 2013.

&amp;nbsp;

until 2017 I was unemployed and started to see and hang out with smokers, I said to myself mmm just one you already know how to quit you will be fine. annnnnd since June it is a on and off habit. 

&amp;nbsp;

And guess what I am back to the states again and I can't even afford that shit, but you know what..

&amp;nbsp;

I AM GOING TO DO it again and stop.

I just moved to my new apartment with amazing roommates - non smokers - and its 2:00 am, and I am looking at a torn half empty disgusting smelly orange white drug. so fuck this. tomorrow I am going to find a gym and start lifting again. 

**simple math, - remove bad habit  + add new good habit.**

thank you for you time, lets do this guys.

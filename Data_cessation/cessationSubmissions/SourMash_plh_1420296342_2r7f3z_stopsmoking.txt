Day 46 without a smoke, here is how it has gone

Days 1-3, sucked terribly and I hated life.  Day 4:  promised myself that I would have a cig on day five as a reward if I could just make it one day more.  Day five:  didn't want to waste four days hard work, promised myself a cigarette on day six if I could make it one more day.  Day seven:  continued putting off a cigarette, started to wonder when I would stop thinking about cigarettes.  Days 8-11, basically the same as day seven, but I developed a holier than thou streak over my quit that made doing without a bit easier.  Drank on day 8, challenging but not impossible.  Days 12-30, increasingly proud, able to poop again, not hungry 100% of the time, cravings down to 4-6 per day and very manageable.  Days 30-45:  people are sick of hearing how awesome I am.  I went on a spending spree with money that would have been used for smokes, got three sweaters, two pairs of jeans, some nice socks, and a new haircut.  Day 46:  been up for two hours, and just had my first thought of cigarettes, which is a real win for me.

This really was easy, minus days 1-3, which were pretty crappy.

Cold turkey is the only way to go, by the way.

Withdrawal from nicorette gum?

Hello, I am on day 3 of quitting nicotine cold turkey. I was chewing about 3, 4mg nicorette gum pieces a day along with vaping a few times throughout the day. I have noticed a significant increase in anxiety and struggle sleeping. I am attributing this to quitting the nicotine but am somewhat surprised that I would be experiencing such withdrawal from what I considered minor use.

Almost 24 hours smoke free

This is so hard. I've been a smoker for nearly 20 years. Everything I do is tied in some way to smoking. It's hard to divorce that from myself... but. But. ...

I actually made out with my wife (of 7 years) for the first time in forever. I went to the store with her for groceries and didn't smoke. I went outside with the dog and didn't smoke. These are small things, and it hasn't even been 24 hours, but I finally, finally just got sick of it. Hopefully finally. anyway, I really don't want to tell *everyone* yet because of all the pressure. I kinda just want them to realize over time that I don't smoke anymore.

Anyway, thanks for letting me tell you guys at least. The wife is skeptical, understandably so, but for as long as it lasts, she's cool. It's been a weird day, playing at life as a non-smoker. Hope it gets less weird. Cheers and thanks for reading:)

What was your reason for quitting?

I know a lot of the time people say “don’t quit for other people, quit for yourself and your own health”. Well, I quit for my gf of 3+ years.  
  
Before we started going steady, I had already been a non-smoker for a couple years, then moved in with some room mates who vaped and got me into that. I figured it was alright to vape cuz it’s not like having to kiss an ash tray and some of the flavors smelt really good.  
  
Fast forward about 1.5 years into our relationship, I had been sneaking cigs every so often. Bum one after band practice. Bum one while we’re out drinking. Bum a few at parties. Buy a pack so I don’t keep bumming. Hey, I’m a smoker again. First thing I did after I bought that pack was admit it. Took her to a nice dinner and all to “soften the blow” I figured.  
  
Bless my gf, cuz I knew she hated it. She said “if that’s what you want to do, I won’t stop you. But I won’t kiss you”. Selfishly, I smoked for about 9-12 months (didn’t really keep track).   
  
I knew enough was enough. I knew I had to quit for her. So I did. I quit when we went on vacation to visit her family. They never knew I did in the first place, and I’m sure would probably have thought lesser of me if they knew I smoked. So it was cold turkey as soon as I stepped off that plane. Got our rental car, smoked my last cig on January 12th, and haven’t looked back.  
  
I still say to her “man, a smoke sounds good right about now” to express my anxiety. She gets it. All she does is gives me a kiss and says “I’m proud of you for quitting”.  
  
So what’s your quitting story?

I've set a quit date!

I've set a quit date! And I'm actually excited about it! Maybe proud is a better word? I have a very set routine when it comes to smoking so I'm a little nervous about how I'm going to come up with one that doesn't include smoking. I also suffer from occasional panic attacks and smoking was a way to "cope" with them. It distracted me. So that's another concern. But I'm grateful for this forum and feel confident it will help. Thanks for "listening"!
**Edit: I stuck with my quit date and am now 5 days smoke free. Yes!!

Zits after quitting? At 33 years old?! What. The. FUCK. What is happening?

I stopped getting acne at 18, and never had a problem again, except maybe an occasional one that would pop up and go away in a day or two.

I'm getting them on both temples and down my cheekbone since quitting, and I'm just over 3 weeks in (using a patch).  What the fuck is my scumbag body doing to me, why, and when the fuck will this pass?

Sorry for the rant, but this is bullshit.

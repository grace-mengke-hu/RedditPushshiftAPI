Started Smoking Again

I've been smoke free for a month but a really stressful time is happening right now and i've started again and i've lost all my confidence and i feel guilty and defeated, I don't know what to do as my will power is so low at the moment, has anyone got any suggestions on how to get some will power back? Thanks

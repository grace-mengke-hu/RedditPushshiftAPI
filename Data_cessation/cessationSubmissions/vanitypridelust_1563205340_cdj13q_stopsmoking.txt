I just want *one*, but I know I can't, and it's making me mental

I'm over 200 days clean. Did it cold turkey. 

After the first month, any cravings subsided massively. I wasn't looking at the pack racks in the convenience store anymore. Wasn't feeling the longing pang when a friend would light up. Wasn't able to stand the smell of my still-smoking friends. After three months the smoking dreams thankfully stopped.

After 4 months, Hubby had stopped smoking too. He has a vape he uses a handful of times a day, but that's it. And that has made it even easier. 

But ever since hitting the 6 month mark a little while ago, suddenly every day I want a cigarette so bad and I have to fight that feeling. And I don't know where it came from.

Every time I start to romanticize it I stomp down those thoughts as vigorously as I can. I remind myself of all the reasons I stopped. I remind myself how many days I've made it. How proud I am to be a nonsmoker. How happy I am not to be a slave to a stupid smelly deathstick. 

But my brain keeps telling me "just one". Just one just one just one. And there's no such thing as just one, and I know that. But I keep thinking about having that just one. One cig out of a fresh pack. Sitting on the patio in the sun with a beer. Slow drags and closing my eyes and sinking into the chair.

I try to give myself all the things around the cigarette. Going outside, sitting in the sun, drinking water instead of beer but even beer a few times. Closing my eyes. Meditating. It's really lovely, but it's just not what I want.

And what I want more than anything at this point is just to stop wanting. I had done it and everything was fine and so easy and I still have no idea what happened to flip the script on me.

I don't know. I just needed somewhere to vent. I know I'm doing really well, I know I need to keep pushing, and I'll do what has to be done. I'm just mad about it right now lol.

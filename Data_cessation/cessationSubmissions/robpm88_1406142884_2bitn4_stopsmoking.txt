Day 1, I quit smoking in the past for 3 months and might need help this time!

Sup non smokers!

Been smoking for 10 years (I'm 26) and I smoke maybe 25-30 smokes a day, rollies to be precise. I stumbled across this sub after my first failed attempt so I'm hoping you guys can give me tips on how to stay smoke free.

Also what are your thoughts on e cigs? Viable quitting tool or just another vice?

Why isn't allen carr name in bold at the top of stopsmoking?

Another thing for all those crapy ad on tv, we really need to crack down on them.  In my opinion of course.  They just piss me off.  When i was smoking and i saw that ad with the  cat and dog piss being in cigarette.  I would laugh and light up another one.  Its not helping, these people should be pushing allen carr's book.  I thank you people for letting me know about this book.  I would of never have stop.

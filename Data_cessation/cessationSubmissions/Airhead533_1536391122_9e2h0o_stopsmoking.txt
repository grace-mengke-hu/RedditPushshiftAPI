Alright friends the time has come.

The first thing I want to say is thank you.

Thank you to every person that took the time to answered anything I've posted on here , those 2 or 3 comments really do make the difference when you're in the middle of a REALLY bad craving. Someone to just say " Hey, you've got this! "

Without this sub-reddit I honestly think that I would still be smoking at this point. It all started when I was desperately looking for a something online that would give me the secret code to finally kick the habit. Of course the only thing that makes you quit smoking is you.  About a week after I found this group I ordered the Allen Carr book and read it front to back. Now it still took me about 4 attempts after I read it and 6 more before it really stuck. It's been over a year and I think I can now safely say that I am a non smoker. I still see it all over, tv, at work, online, all I say is that it might look relaxing or cool. It isnt. Nothing about smoking will give you any redeeming quality or add ANYTHING to your life.

I don't frequent here as much as I used to but I will make the effort to pop in here now and then and show my support in the middle of the night to that 1 person who just needs some re-affirmation. I love you all and owe many of you more than you know.

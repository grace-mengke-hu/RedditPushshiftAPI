I am looking for positive reinforcement for using the nicotine patch

I am using the patch.  My cravings are more psychological than physical and I can wait them out/get distracted before they get the best of me.

I am having problems with redness and itching at the site where the patch was the day before.

I am moving the patch's site and not wearing it the same place twice in a week, as directed.

I've tried OTC steroid cream and eczema cream to deal with the itching without relief

Did anyone else have this problem and if so, how did you deal with it?

If this is just the way it is, I'll put up with it.

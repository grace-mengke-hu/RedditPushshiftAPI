Over 6 weeks plus great news

My smoking app says it has been 6 weeks 6 days, and that I would have smoked almost 1,000 nasty cigarettes by now. The truth is, I don't really think about smoking anymore. But the really good news is: I talked 2 more people into trying Chantix. My friend took his first pill today. I used Chantix to quit and it worked wonders.  This medicine saved my life. I can't help but preach about it. Cold turkey whipped my ass so many times, but with Chantix, quitting smoking was so unbelievably easy.

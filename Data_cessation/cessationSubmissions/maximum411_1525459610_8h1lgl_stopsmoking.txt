Nicotine lozenges without sugar alcohol?

I like using nicotine lozenges, but they all contain sugar alcohols, which give me terrible gas and bloating (same with sugar free gum, candy, etc.). Are there any brands sweetened with something other than sugar alcohol, like aspartame and sucralose? So far I have not found any that are 100% sugar alcohol free.

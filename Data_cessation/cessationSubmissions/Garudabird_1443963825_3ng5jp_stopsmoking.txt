First smoking dream

So I am about to hit the 3 month mark and feeling very happy about that. Last night though I had a dream that I smoked, which I know is pretty common. The worst thing was that I in my dream I hid it from my Dad because I didn't want him to know but then he lit up as well.  He quit 4 years ago.  Woke up feeling sick with disappointment until I realised it wasn't real but it was a good reminder. 

Keep committed fellow quitters!

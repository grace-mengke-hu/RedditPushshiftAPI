Intense cravings after 3 years...[UPDATE]

Just to give an update in case any poor soul is trawling the internet late at night in the same situation as I was.

 

Turns out I was diagnosed with viral meningitis, and a particularly severe case at that. It's a virus that affects the covering of your brain and causes all sorts of awful mental effects. One of these is unusual, profound depression.

 

And guess what I used to do when I was depressed? That's right. I smoked. Actually I thought the symptoms of depression were actually just cravings for cigarettes! Wrong. When I described how I felt to my doctor she said that it wasn't cravings but depression I was feeling. This makes sense because the only other time I've been depressed was when I quit smoking. So naturally I confused the two. Makes a lot more sense now. Just posting an update in the hope that it might give someone else in the same situation a little piece of mind. The cravings were the first symptom to go.

 

Other than that I never get cravings (prior to getting ill) since I quit three years ago. So to anyone reading this, keep going. It will get better.

 

Anyway, looks like I'm going to have to move over to a meningitis recovery forum now (; It's going to take me a long time to recover from this sadly. But I think I will eventually. Thanks for the encouraging words of support from everyone here. You really did help during a very dark time.

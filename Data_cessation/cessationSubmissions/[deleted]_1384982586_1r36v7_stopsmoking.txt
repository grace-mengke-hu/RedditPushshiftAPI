Revelation

Mostly posting this to reinforce the idea for myself, so I apologize if it's a little cheesy.  In a few hours it'll officially be 12 days since I last smoked, and there are times (usually towards the end of the work day) where I feel exhausted by the amount of effort I have to put in to NOT smoke at times.  Not physical effort of course, but mental.  I just want to not have to work so hard at being a non smoker.

But I realized that my biggest motivator in this quit is seeing myself become the victor instead of the victim.  Instead of feeling all "woe is me, I have to struggle with cravings" I want to be able to say to myself "you fucking kick ass, you achieved this, you can achieve anything."  I feel like quitting for more than 3 days has made me realize  how in control of my own life I am.

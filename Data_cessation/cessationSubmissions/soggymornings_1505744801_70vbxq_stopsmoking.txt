6 months smoke free and never been better!

I have not smoked a cigarette in 6 months and it's been a challenge some days. Especially either first thing in the morning when I want something to go with my coffee, or late at night when I want to relax. 

But days like today make me realize why not giving in is for the best. Aside from not feeling self conscious about how I smell, I am getting over my sickness so much quicker and easier than usual. 

For the past few years I have gotten sick two or three times each year. My sickness would knock me out for at least one week and I would have lingering sickness for another week or two on top of that one week. My current sickness is not escalating! It is very easy to deal with and actually feels like it is going away.

Quitting smoking is the best thing I have ever done.

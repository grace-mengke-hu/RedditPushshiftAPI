My name is BendoverOR, and I'm a smoker.

I smoked since high school. Freshman year, bumming smokes from the older kids at the bus stop. No one gave a shit, Mom wasn't around, Dad was always working, and I made some friends. I was the squeaky clean little kid surrounded by the rough crowd, the trouble-makers, and the punks.

I smoked for years. I smoked up until 2011, when I quit. I managed to get smoke-free without a lot of stress. Its actually a funny story. I had tried to quit once before. I came home from work on day 2, and my wife met me at the door with a pack of my brand and a lighter. "You're an asshole. Don't come in until you've had 2 of these," and she slammed the door in my face.

A few months later, I got involved in my college's Criminal Justice club, and we help out with the yearly Active Shooter training our cities agency hosts for basically every department in 100 miles. This entailed myself and a handful of others playing hostages, dead people, screaming victims, innocent bystanders, and 2 shooters per scenario.

I'm a gun guy, so I volunteered to be a shooter *a lot*. This meant I would be running a lot, wearing heavy clothing in the summer heat, plus body armor and a riot helmet. This also meant a lot of cursing at **everyone** as part of the scenario.

I had forgot to buy cigarettes sunday night before we began, and monday was bright and early with no chance to grab a pack on my way in. The next 4-5 days went on with a continual 6 hours of running, jumping over stuff, and a lot of cursing at everyone, including cops. Few things in life will match the adrenaline rush of standing in the courtyard of your local high school with a loaded gun (FX rounds, I should point out. Paintball bullets) and wondering who was coming through the door.

Sometimes it was an FTO with his brand new rookie. 

Sometimes it was a 4-man SWAT team stack with automatic rifles.

Every day my wife and I would go home, and be too exhausted to do much more than sit on the couch. I was so tired I forgot I wanted a cigarette.

Saturday morning, I woke up and realized I hadn't had a cigarette in 5 days, and I was through the worst part of quitting.

That was 3 years ago. Once I quit, I stayed quit. My two jobs after I quit were both in places that **heavily** discouraged smoking and besides, I was feeling healthier for having quit.

Up until about 3 months ago. My wife and I lost our house, I started a new job that didn't pan out the way I wanted to, and I was surrounded by smokers in places that encouraged smoking. We both started new jobs last month, and things are going great. Were getting a home, again, and picking up the pieces.

My wife hates that I'm smoking again. I'm ashamed of myself for smoking around my kids. Its an expensive habit with no real benefit to me, and what limited benefits their are (it helps me de-stress) are vastly outweighed by the bad things.

But, dangit, I enjoy the *act* of smoking. Taking that little 10 minute break every couple hours helps me feel better, at least for a little while. And worse yet, I seem to have no will-power. I see someone smoking at work, I'll bum a cigarette. And I'll feel ashamed of myself for doing it, later. 

I'm thinking about some sort of e-cig just for the oral fixation, something without all the dangerous chemicals, but then I'm just blowing water vapor and seriously, whats the freakin' point?

I keep telling myself I need to take my breaks somewhere other than the smoking area, but I always find myself out there.

I want to be healther. I went on Keto at the beginning of the year, and lost a shitton of weight. I've been off keto the same amount of time I started smoking, almost to the day. I want to have better habits than this, and I want to not be embarrassed about my filthy habit that I had beaten.

So I'm taking this a day at a time. I'm trying new things. I'm looking for something healthy to replace my smoke break, something that makes me feel better and that I'm not ashamed of.

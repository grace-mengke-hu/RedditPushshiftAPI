It's a good thing Allen Carr supplied us with all these tools to fight relapse...

I'm almost done with my fourth day now, and my brain is ON FIRE. My mind is in a fucking vice grip.

It's funny, a few days ago, I thought I would never, ever think about relapsing. Reading Allen Carr's book really supplies you with a false sense of security. His "yippee" chant seems like a reality. "I'm free!"

Right now all I want is too sleep. I'll admit: most of today was better than day one. I didn't feel like a smoker for several hours today, doing yard work, riding in the car with someone smoking, no big deal. 

But now, that the sun has gone down, and I'm left alone with my thoughts, my brain is on fire. The need to smoke is intense. 

Don't worry: I'm not gonna do it. Fuck that. Carr and Freedom from Nicotine got me all like "If I smoke one more puff..." yadda yadda yadda. 

I'm just lucky that nothing is going on right now. No sudden deaths in the family, no loss of limb of livelihood.

Cuz I'd be fucked. 

I'd like to write more about this. It's funny the kind of things I've done today. I forced my tired girlfriend to spend time with me, and as I hugged her I was all like "ahhhh, dopamiinneee, mi amigo"

I'm scraping the barrel of known pleasures to its bare, bleak bottom. Peanut butter on a spoon. Running. Drinking alcohol. Watching sports. Masturbation.

Sleep is all that is left. 

To whoever has done this before me, those who have smoked longer than me, who smoked more than me: Damn.

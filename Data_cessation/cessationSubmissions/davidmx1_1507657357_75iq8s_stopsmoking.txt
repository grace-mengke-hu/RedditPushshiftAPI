Can i get used to smoking less?

It's been a few days only and I cut down abruptly instead of gradually. From about 15 to 3 a day.  A lot of people i know personally smoked like 2 cigarettes a day for a year or something then quit.  But my question for people who cut down first is do you eventually get used to smoking less or do you have to consciously make an effort not to smoke all the time?

Stick with it! You have to do nothing at all to remain a non-smoker.

We have to do nothing to succeed. How easy does that sound? To achieve our goal here, we simply have to do nothing.

We just need to NOT smoke.

I still read this place, but have not commented for a while. It was around a year-and-a-half ago that I started reading /r/stopsmoking. 

The stuff I'd learned here was so valuable, but mainly what I learned was that there were many others in the same boat - people who were sick and tired of feeling like we are a slave to something. People who are looking to become more healthy by dropping a horrible habit. 

So, it was the sum of the information and the community which have provided some of the most valuable tools and techniques to help quit smoking. 

Here's some of my old posts that still ring true for me today:

[Don't Cheat](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/165hb3/dont_cheat/)

[You have to want to quit](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/x0kfb/you_have_to_want_to_quit/)

[@ 60 days: What's working](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/wbni8/60_days_whats_working/)

Keep at it! Time to start thinking beyond the quitting phase! Time to start using some of those reasons for quitting to enact and empower some other positive life change!

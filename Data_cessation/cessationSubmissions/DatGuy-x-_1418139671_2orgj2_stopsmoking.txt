Triple Digits!

I have reached day 100!

I feel great, and barely ever think about smoking anymore, and when I do its a brief fleeting thought that's easily cast aside.

For all you new starters, it gets so much easier, and it happens without you even realizing.

Keep with it, its totally worth it.

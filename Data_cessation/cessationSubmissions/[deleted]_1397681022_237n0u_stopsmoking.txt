16 Days and I'm depressed

I'm fine physically, cravings are fading, physical withdrawals are gone. But I hate myself. I want to fucking die. I am miserable. I can't make it 24 hours without breaking sporadically into sobs and fits of hysteria. I keep telling myself it's because I'm quitting but I can't fully bring myself to believe it. I am not okay right now. I haven't felt this unstable in years. Help me.

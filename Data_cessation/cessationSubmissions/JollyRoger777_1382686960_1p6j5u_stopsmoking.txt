Just threw away half a pack of cigarettes.

I probably hate wasting money more than I hate smoking. But I had to do it. I'm 22 and I have been smoking cigarettes for a little over a year now. I picked it up while working on an especially difficult paper for college. I'm also 100lbs overweight. So for my health, I had to do it. Next step is eating better and going to the gym. I'm going to use the money I save from smoking for a gym membership. I tried to quit for my girlfriend before. People are right when they say you have to quit for you. I want to be healthy. I desperately want to be healthy.

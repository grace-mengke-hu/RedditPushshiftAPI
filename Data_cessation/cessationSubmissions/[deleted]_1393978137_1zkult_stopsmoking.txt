426 days since my last smoke, reporting in.

Hey Fellow ex-smokers.

I'm proud to say that is has been 426 days since I've last inhaled nicotine.

I'm here to say that I feel a lot better, I can now run 2 miles without suffocating.. I'm also here to say that the struggle, no matter how small, is almost always there.. It's hard to imagine the monkey ever getting off my back but as time goes by, I can assure you, the monkey gets weaker.

I wish you all who are trying to quit the strength needed to stop this terrible habit once and for all.

Here is to another 426 days.

Hi there, i am writing to you while having hopefully my last pack of cigarettes with 14 cigs in it.

From this day i want to quit smoking, so what i want is to stay with me guys for the next days so i can forget about them. I'll update how it goes. Thanks !!!

edit: threw those cigs in the toilet, have none left ...first day must be hard 

update: broke up with my girlfriend after a fight, have huge desire to smoke...i stay put, still not smoking

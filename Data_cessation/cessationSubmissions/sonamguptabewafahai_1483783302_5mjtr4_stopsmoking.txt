[SOS] 5 Days , 4 hours into my quit.. suddenly getting intense cravings

Any tips for a rookie quitter ? I have been a pack a day smoker for more than 10 years and finally managed to quit on the 2nd of January. Things were going fine till now when I have started having the strongest cravings of my quit. I read that day 3 was supposed to be tough but for me it went like a breeze. Today I am struggling.

Slight headache, stomach cramps and confusion also pestering me..

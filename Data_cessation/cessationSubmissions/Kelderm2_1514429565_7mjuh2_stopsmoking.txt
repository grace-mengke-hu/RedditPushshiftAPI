It's been so long that I forgot this subreddit.

I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who was here for me initially. I completely forgot this sub existed but imagine my surprise to come back and see 861 days next to my username. 

For everyone else out there trying to quit, keep at it! I know it is tough, but you all can and WILL do it!

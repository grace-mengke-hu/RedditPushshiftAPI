Hello from Day 9

I don't have a lot of time but I wanted to give a quick update/encouragement.

1.  I made it through Saturday...I kept busy and ate delicious healthy foods.  Quite by happenstance I ended up having a snack with a smoker acquaintance and I could smell it on her.  That was a real wakeup call!
2.  For those of you on the patch, I found covering the edges with medical tape or bandaids prevents the big square of sticky lint from forming.
3.  My body was like a three year old having a tantrum!  "So you won't smoke if I make your jaw bother you or make your chest feel tight?  FINE.  I WON'T POOP."  That lasted until about Day 6 or so, and now all those bothersome feelings/sides are gone.  All that remains is about a 3x/day wistful longing for a cigarette, and, toward the end of the day, slight aggravation.
4.  I bought my 7mg patches on Saturday so I'm ready to step down Thursday.  I thought about doing it sooner than that, but with the stress of my lifestyle I don't want to risk a backslide.

Keep going, friends, and if you haven't started yet, don't be afraid to try!

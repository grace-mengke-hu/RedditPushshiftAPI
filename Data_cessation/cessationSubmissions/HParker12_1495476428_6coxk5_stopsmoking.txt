40 days and counting

It's been 40 days since I had my last cigarette but I am using the patch to help. The first week was great then the withdrawals started kicking in. Now I feel like crap all the time, I'm depressed, and all I want to do is sleep (yet it's either I can sleep or I can't) and can't forget about the mood swings!!! The horrible mood swings that can be triggered by the tiniest of things. There is no way I'm going back to cigarettes but i just want to feel good again!!! How long does this typically last? Anyone ever experience these long withdrawal symptoms?

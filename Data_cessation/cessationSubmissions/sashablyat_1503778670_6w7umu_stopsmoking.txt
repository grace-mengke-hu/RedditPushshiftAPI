Has anyone else experienced rotten tasting phlegm coming from throat after quitting?

One month into quitting and about a week ago I've noticed this persistent rot taste/smell coming from the back of my throat. I take good care of my teeth and floss once a day and gargle with listerine but it still persists, and based on my research it might be the accumulated toxins from my lungs surfacing to my throat but that sounds sort of theoretical. Has anyone else had any experience with this?

My quit begins today

Wish me luck guys. Last night I smoked my last cigarette and my last bowl. My house has been rid of all smoking paraphernalia. Perhaps I’ll meet up with Mary Jane once I’m nice and settled, but this must be the final exit of Lady Nicotine. I’ve had enough. I have quit once before completely cold turkey. I lasted 3 months before I caved in and bought a pack after a shitty drunken night. But I won’t make the same mistakes again. I’m tired of being enslaved to substances.

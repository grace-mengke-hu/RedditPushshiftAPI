Trying to help my boyfriend quit. What can I do?

My boyfriend has been a smoker for over 20 years (started when he was a teen) and has been trying to quit for as long as I have known him. 


Are there things I can do to encourage him? I have left him loving notes taped to his cigarettes before, and I've thought about hiding joints in his packs so he can smoke those instead (its legal here). I would much rather him smoke weed, but it is much much more expensive.


I never say anything when he breaks down and starts smoking again because I don't want to shame him, but is there anything I could say that would help him? Are there things I could do that would make an impact? I am not a smoker and have never been addicted to anything in my life, so its hard for me to understand where he is.

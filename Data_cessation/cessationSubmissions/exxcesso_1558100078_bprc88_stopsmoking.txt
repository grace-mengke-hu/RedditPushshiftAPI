First Day Off the Patch

I did steps 1 through 3 religiously, and today is my first day fully nicotine free. I feel like shit. I hadn’t had smoking cravings since step 1, but now all of a sudden I got them again. My stomach is in knots, my hands are sweaty and I am considerably more tired than usual despite getting my regular amount of sleep. I feel myself get moody over the smallest things, and all I keep picturing is ALL the fried food. Someone, please help! How do I kick these cravings? What do I do about wanting to eat fatty food? I recently lost 30 lbs, and I don’t want to gain it all back up. I didn’t think the cravings would be this bad considering I’m detoxing from a small amount of nicotine only. And I REFUSE to smoke again. What worked for you? I’ll try anything, I’m desperate!

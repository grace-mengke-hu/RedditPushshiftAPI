Smokers palate

Hello people,

Did anyone had smokers palate (nicotine stomatitis) before?  I'm off the tobacco for almost a month (RYO cigarettes) and it still hasn't passed. I'm sure it's nicotine stomatitis, I've been diagnosed. At the time I wasn't planning to quit so I never asked my doctor how long it takes. Apparently it takes a few weeks but it has been a month and no significant changes on my palate. It's getting frustrating.

Did anyone quit for this reason? I'm wondering for how long it took for your palate to heal?

Thanks in advance!

I'm 9 days in and going strong. A few questions and tips.

So I'm doing fairly well but I have some concerns.  First of all my mother smokes like a chimney and it makes it really hard for me because they are right there.  So what I've done, and what others can do too if they live with a smoker, is create a separate "space" in a room and fill it with great smells.  I use frankincense and myrrh and dab my wrists with a lovely smelling perfume.  I create a barrier between myself and the smells of the rest of the house.  

Every time I get up I look in the mirror and look at how healthier I look, how my face seems to be "glowing" a bit compared to the grayness of a smoker's face.

Now the problem comes with the fact that I would call myself a singer, and quitting has caused me to have in increase in tone and range but it almost hurts to sing for some reason.  I think it's just the tar wanting to come out and whatnot.  Exercise helps a lot.  I also associate smoking with my favorite musicians and singers and that makes smoking look so tempting.  I have to remind myself that their voices would have been so much better without smoking.

And finally, I have an anxiety disorder and smoking has been a sort of "totem" for me.  It was something I could rely on to dissuade negative thoughts and anxious ones.  I'm trying to find a way around this and would like some help if anyone else has this issue.

Good luck to everyone!

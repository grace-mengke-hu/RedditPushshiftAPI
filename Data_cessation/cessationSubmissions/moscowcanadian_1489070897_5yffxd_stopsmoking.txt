I've made it this far, almost caved last night!

Went out for a few drinks with some friends last night, specifically limited the number of beers I had because I didn't want to be tempted to smoke, however I was super close at the end of the night to bumming a cigarette. I didnt though! Still going strong on my millionth quit.

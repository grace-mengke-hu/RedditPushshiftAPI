Doing without thinking ....

Hi All! Just thought this was weird and worth a share. So, I am having a good week! Cravings are not as harsh and I am feeling positive! Then yesterday, sitting at my desk I thought I would go make coffee. Next thing I know my hand has disappeared into my handbag and I actually thought 'hang on, what am I looking for!?' Then realised, my hand had taken on a life of it's own and was looking for my cigarettes! As I said, weird! But a little bit amusing. Conscious me didn't want a cigarette at all!

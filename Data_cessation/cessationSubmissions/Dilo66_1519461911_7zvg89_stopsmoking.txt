Bloodsugar after Quitting

So now I‘m off for almost 4 Weeks.
I have a Diabetes 2, BMI 25, about Twice a Week some sports, just metformin as medication.
Couldn’t see any changes in Bloodsugar the first week.

But now it raised dramatically in the morning, from 160mg/dL to 240mg/dL. 
Just using sugarfree mints after cold turkey. I‘m aware of what I‘m eating.

Anybody else having trouble with BS after Quitting?

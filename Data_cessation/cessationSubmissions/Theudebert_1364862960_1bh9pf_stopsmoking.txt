So, today's my day 3 . . .

And as I write this I'm getting ready to go to a social event where I plan to drink.  However, I will not allow that to cause me to slip up and lose the good progress I've made so far.  Heck, today hasn't even been nearly as bad as I thought it would be.

And in accordance with my decision to cut down on my drinking, I'm not going to over do it tonight.  I'm just going to have a couple glasses of wine and leave it at that so I don't wake up tomorrow with a hangover (which I've been doing much too often lately).  These are promises I am making to myself.

The other day I received some additional motivation to quit from my mom in a message on facebook, which I have appended below (old-person-style typing retained for comic relief):

"hI! hAPPY eASTER eARLY.....WE WILL BE MISSING YOU TOMORROW. aLSO, sOOOO GLAD YOU QUIT SMOKING, [Uncle] CALLED TODAY AND SAID THAT [Aunt] WAS IN THE HOSPITAL AND THEY FOUND SHE HAS EMPHYSEMA, OR COPD. sHE SMOKED FOR ABOUT 35 YEARS AND QUIT 10 YEARS AGO. wE'LL FIND OUT MORE TOMORROW, JUST HOPE SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO USE OXYGEN ALL THE TIME.

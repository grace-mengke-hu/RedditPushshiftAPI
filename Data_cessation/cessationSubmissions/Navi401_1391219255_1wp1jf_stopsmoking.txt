How can I help my dad not go back to smoking.

My dad has been smoking most of his life. He started when he was 13 when his literature teacher gave cigarettes to his students. His parents didn't care because they both smoked and then his younger sister started smoking as well, in fact when his youngest brother wanted to start smoking none of them let him threatning to kick his a$$ because they all knew how addiction feels. My dad kept smoking into his late 30s and early 40s. He quit for about 8 years but has started smoking up again 4 years ago. The other night he was out of cigs and he wanted me to go out to buy him a pack, which I am normally fine with, if he wants to smoke I dont care, I can't force him to quit, he has to decide that on his own, but that night I told him that I couldn't go because I was... *ehem* on the toilet... plus it was past midnight. So he decieded that he could go the night without a smoke. The next day when he got back from work he told me that he was really stressed because he hadn't had a cig all day. I congratulated him and we had a pretty normal night. Today when he got back from work he said he wanted to go buy a **carton** of cigarettes open all the packs, tie them all together and smoke them all. I congratulated him again for not smoking all day agian and so far he is fine. But I want to know what is it that I should say to him if I see that he is smoking a cigarette. What would you guys find helpful? I really dont want him to smoke again. I want him to be around for as long as possible because I love being with him. I'm still young, 18, but I want him to someday meet his grandkids and take them to ball games and spend time with them. 

Thanks guys, Keep up the good work,

Just finished a hugely successful work project...

I just finished a huge work project and the presentation couldn't have gone any better... And want to celebrate by relapsing...?  It's six or seven months since I "successfully" quit.  I've stopped counting. 

I have the next several days off and I know this sounds ridiculous but all I want to do is sit on my porch and have a beer and smoke a pack of cigarettes.  Not just one a whole pack.  And I don't know why, the relief of having this project done?  This is the most relaxed and I have felt in a long time.  

I am in great shape, my teeth are white, and I am eating well.  I feel great every day when I wake up.  Why do I want to go back?  I am hoping to have some self realization by writing this.

To those of you just starting out down the path of quitting.  It sucks, for a while.  But it is worth it.  And as you can see it is a struggle.  

I am going for a run, I apologize for this rant of self pity.

Any suggestions or a bucket of cold water to the face would be greatly appreciated.

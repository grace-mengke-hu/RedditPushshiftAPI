500 Days

Just hit my 500 day mark being smoke free a few days ago. To anyone who is still struggling with their quit: hang in there. I still get cravings sometimes, and the occasional dream about smoking. For the most part, I don't think about it or miss it. Just take it one day at a time :) and don't be so hard on yourself. Do the best you can!

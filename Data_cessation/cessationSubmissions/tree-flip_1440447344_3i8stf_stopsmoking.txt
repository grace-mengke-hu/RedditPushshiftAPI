The world smells like shit and I love it

I feel like it took me a while to get my smell back, compared to what I read.  Tho I will never forget  the first time I noticed my smell returning. I walked into the gas station by my house and it smelled like shit. This store never smelled to great, but from then on it was fucking horrible. I now feel like I have a shity superpower for smelling bad smells. But, every time I smell a foul stench,I'm reminded that I can actually breathe. It's that thought right there that makes the shity smells so awesome. But seriously, that gas station is bad.

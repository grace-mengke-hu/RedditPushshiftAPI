Help me stop 1 cigarette a day

I have a horrible cycle of 1 cigarette a day and I can't stop.  I have a 15 minute daily walk after work and always want one.  I don't buy them but offer a dollar to bum one so it's easy to get.  No one knows I do this and getting away with it is part of the thrill.  I've done this for years.  I tell myself 1 isn't bad for my health and I don't get the gross feeling as when I was a regular smoker.  I always regret it as soon as I'm done. Help me figure out how to quit this horrible cycle!

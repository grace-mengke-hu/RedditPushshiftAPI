I feel like non-smokers underestimate the struggle

I've been smoke free for several months now and I feel like a new person. However it took me many attempts to finally break it through once and for all. I don't know about other quitters but I really felt like it was the hardest thing in my life, like quitting some kind of really powerful drug. I've heard heroine users say in some articles that quitting smoking was harder than quitting H, I don't know if it's exaggerated but it sure doesn't feel so.
 
Upon my hardest times in midst of quitting I tried to seek support from my close friends and family but since they are all non-smokers or smokers who don't even plan to quit then they all kind of shrugged it off and told me I was a really weak minded person for not being able to quit this very small thing. I think it's hard to empathize if you haven't experienced this yourself and kind of feels so regular thing people do and not really pay attention to it.
Maybe some people have it harder than others I don't know but for me it has been a trip to hell and back...

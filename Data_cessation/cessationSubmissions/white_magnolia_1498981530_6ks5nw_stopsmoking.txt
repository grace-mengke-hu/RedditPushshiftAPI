First craving for a very long time. Possible triggers.

Hi. I quit last September. This means I need to be around 9.5 months smoke free. I did it by removing the major trigger: alcohol. I quit both things at the same time and to me it was the best thing to do. Right now I drink very carefully and avoid getting drunk, which is basically good for mental and physical well being. 

Recently I've adopted a dog which seemed to be almost perfect, but due to my mistakes as a newbie (I never had a dog before) he started to behave worse and worse. I need to get some professional help for him. Or should I say, for myself. I worry so much.

And right now I can't stop thinking how easy it would be to just buy some cigs and smoke, and just let go. I'm almost fantasizing how nice it would be to go outside on my balcony with a cup of coffee and a stinking stick.

Ugh, but the price, aftertaste, mental fog and 9.5 motnhs are stopping me.

Smoking and Sporting Events

Small humblebrag as I'm coming up on 1 year smoke free on July 19 (woo!), but I noticed something today when I went to a baseball game in my city. I was waiting outside the gates for my friends to show up (they had the tickets) and I was just people watching. I noticed a ton of people outside the gates just puffing away on their vapes or cigarettes and it made me think. I'm so happy for how far I have come in finally quitting those silly things but also sad at how some people have to live bound to this stupid vice. I saw one particular woman absolutely huffing away on her industrial sized vape and I couldn't help but feel sorry for her. She just looked dead in the eyes as she tried to ingest as much smoke as possible before heading into the ballpark. I imagined how I used to absolutely have to have a cigarette before going into a place where I couldn't smoke for just a few hours. Amazing how your enjoyment of life itself revolves around nicotine. I never realized how pathetic it all looked from the outside. The drug tricks you. I'm so happy I don't live that life anymore!

My advice to anyone looking to quit for good is to re-arrange your thought processes. Leverage a feeling of superiority. It may seem elitist, but for me it was the only way to help break the spell. I wanted to do better and be better than others around me. So I quit. I'm a new person now and I'm never going back. 

If you stumble, get back up and keep going. You can do it!

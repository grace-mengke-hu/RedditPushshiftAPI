A month's worth of ways to get through cravings.

*Especially those anxious, dark, jittery, longing withdrawals that seem both impossible and manic. Oof*.

Hi sweet pals. I quit smoking exactly a month ago today, and in the days since I've been keeping a big list of all the things that have helped me get through my cravings—the ones that strike when I'm bored, the ones that pop up when I'm around smokers, and the ones that feel absolutely debilitating when I'm at my most anxious.

I'm not a professional (hah, is anyone a professional at this?), but this little list has gotten me through 30 big days and I thought it might help some of you too. When things get ugly, here are some ideas...

&amp;#x200B;

* Big deep breaths, inhale for 3 counts, exhale for 5 counts. Over and over and over until your head and hearts slow down a bit. (This isn't silly yoga sh\*t, this is some parasympathetic nervous system science.) 
* Move your body, get your blood flowing, flush it out—run, stretch, do a headstand against the wall, do 10 pushups, go for a little walk.
* Doodle or write or scribble. It doesn't matter what, just put a pen to paper and let it out.
* Take a shower and sing. Sing loud. Like, *really* loud. REALLY LOUD. 
* See above, but in your car.
* Watch some fail videos on YouTube. This one is from my sister and I swear it works, mostly because LOLing.
* Remind yourself over and over that anxiety will not kill you, it will peak and it will suck, but eventually it has to go back down (and that's the bit where you're growing stronger and getting better and taking control.)
* Go play outside! TREES! NATURE! PLANTS! 
* Make something with your hands. (Because I work at a desk on my computer all day, this one holds strong for me.) Try a new recipe, finish a little project in your house, do a crafty thing. There's some magic in creating something out of nothing. 
* Organize something. I find that tidying up my kitchen really helps me, but maybe that's just because I'm a serious Virgo.
* Turn on your favorite song and dorky dance around your house. Go on, get weird with it!
* Remember that this whole process is way bigger than stopping a bad habit. You are re-wiring your brain—and that shit is hard. Having cravings does not mean you are weak or bad or failing. It means you are going through it and sometimes *through it* really, really sucks.
* Lie on the floor on you back with one hand on your heart and one hand on your stomach and remember the ground is there to hold you up. It's there to support you and you are safe. (This *IS* some silly yoga sh\*t, but sometimes yoga is really on to something.)
* Have an activity snack, which is a completely made-up name for a snack that requires some effort. Think... pistachios, string cheese, clementines.
* Do a 180 and do something that's really good for you (instead of the heath disaster that is smoking). Take a vitamin, do a face mask, toss the junk food in your cabinets.
* Step the hell away from your screen for a moment. Read a book, run an errand without your phone, fall asleep to some white noise instead of TV. The irony is strong with this one...
* Give yourself permission to have a bad day without smoking. Do your very best to not take it out on others, but if you do, always always always apologize and be honest about your cravings and withdrawals. Your people will love you with their big wonderful hearts anyways. 
* Don't worry about tomorrow, don't worry about this weekend, don't worry about next month. You are in this moment, getting though this moment, and you can do it.
* Talk to a friend—or the big ole group of us here—about how you're feeling. It isn't shameful, it isn't cowardly, it isn't bad. You're in it, it's hard as hell, and your feelings are your feelings. Sharing is scary because vulnerability sucks, but relieving the pressure helps. I promise.

Two weeks in, woo! Can't stop putting things in my mouth, boo!

So I've made it 2 weeks and I am really stoked! Of course, still get the odd craving-pang but I've made it through some triggering situations with little more than loud whining. 

However, the hand-near-mouth fixation is strong with this one. I am eating for no reason, other than to fulfil the above. I understand that some of that was bound to happen, so I am trying to not freak out and just be mindful but as someone who has used food as comfort in the past, I would really appreciate any tips you guys have since this is not something that can continue infinitely. 

Thanks in advance!!

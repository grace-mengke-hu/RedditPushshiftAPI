Say hello to your newest member...

Been smoking for 4 years now, an average of 4 cigarettes per day.

I started thinking I could stop at any time and in the first year I did go from smoking for, say a month to not smoking for 2-3 months just to prove that I could stop. Don't know what the hell I was thinking.


Today was my last two cigarettes. I threw the second one after taking two puffs because I felt disgusting when I accidentally smelled my fingers.


I will be posting on this subreddit two times a day every day because I get two triggers per day at specific times. 

I feel like I have reset the clock by smoking today and it does not feel good. Lot of regret.

new cravings after 8 months?!

Hi All!  I stumbled upon this great sub a couple months ago... and wish I would have found it when I had quit smoking!!!  I've been doing well, but recently I find myself thinking about having a cigarette.  Let me clarify that... thinking about how I would have had to have a cigarette at this moment in the past.  This turns into a longing... which gets to the point of a craving.  I have thought about... "just a drag, so I can remember how bad it feels".  I do not want to start again and I don't believe that I'd take even a drag (even when drinking).  I am hoping someone out there can explain these feelings and / or give some guidance.

I cannot stop smoking whenever I'm in office

As per title, any advice is greatly appreciated. I started smoking maybe 6-7 years ago, when I was going through a breakup and in the midst of all the ensuing drinking, a colleague offered me a cigarette. One led to two and not too long later I bought my first pack. I'm 30 now.


I leave my cigs in the office so I don't smoke in the evening and on weekends. Somehow it's easy not to smoke at home, for some reason. I very rarely feel any craving, in fact the thought of smoking doesn't even cross my mind most of the time. I can go on 2-3 week vacations without a single thought or craving but whenever I'm back at work - I will light up. I try to attribute it to stress which may or may not be true but really, I just want to stop "having an excuse" to smoke.


Thus far, I have managed to limit myself to three sticks a day (since a year ago). I am working on getting it to two; but really, I know I will never be able to stop smoking if I can't set my mind straight about having to smoke in office and I just can't seem to get over it. It's almost like clockwork... 10am, 12pm, 3pm... I don't even need to look at the clock sometimes.


I hope this makes sense, sorry but English is not my first language. Thank you for reading.

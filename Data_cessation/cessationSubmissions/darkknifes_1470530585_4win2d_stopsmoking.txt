Please I need your help. This is an absolute nightmare and its only Day 2.

I quit smoking and holy shit the craving is bad. Every time I try to think of anything I just see a cigarette being puffed. 

Its horrible I really am tempted to go buy a pack just to make it stop and feel normal again. Please guys I love you all so much please help me :/ I want to quit but my body won't let me.

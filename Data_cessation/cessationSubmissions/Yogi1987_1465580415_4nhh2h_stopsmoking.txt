What I Did after failing 50+ times and learning from experience.

I was having problem doing basic tasks like walking,eating food in crowded area as i was getting mild panic attacks. So many issues and was still smoking (20+) and drinking. Finally prepared myself mentally that I have to stop for peoples who love me, I cant hurt them by hurting myself. I quit cold turkey and did following things.


1) Decided a date to quit forever.
2) Prepared a plan for next day.
3) Had green tea, fruits, dry fruits, milk etc whenever I had Cravings.
4) Read lot about Benefits of Quit smoking, experience of ex- smokers.
5) Did meditation , started with 5 minutes then gradually increased time. Now i do 20 minutes, 2 sessions per day. It release stress, depression, anxiety etc.
6) Did Running , started small but increased distance slowly day by day. Gave myself reward after running, had banana shake, chocolates etc. Now a regular gym member.
7) Read books Power of Habit, Easy way stop smoking by Allen carr.
8) Used app  get rich or die smoking, best app try it.
9) Focused on one moment at a time, its only 2 weeks which fucks you, after that you dont care much about smoke.

I learned a lot of things about addiction from this smoke quit experience. Now I am on day 20 of quit drinking :) . Once I am sober for 2 months, will try quitting/Minimising Sugar, Quitting Porn addiction, quitting internet addiction , WAY TO GO :)

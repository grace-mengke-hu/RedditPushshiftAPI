Ashamed

So after 2.5 months staying smoke free I landed in Warsaw yesterday and sadly old habit kicked in - I had plenty of cigarettes with drinks last night , feeling really embarrassed for bring so weak, I'm trying to erase it ft on my memory as I was so proud of myself of being in control of that!!!

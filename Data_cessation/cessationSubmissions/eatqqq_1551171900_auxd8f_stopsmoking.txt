Smoke a half-finished cigarette more harm?

I have switched from 0.5/5mg cigarette to a 'light' 0.1/1mg cigarette for some time and have managed to maintain the same amount per day (5~7 pcs), which i think this is some progress.

Now im thinking of progressing more, by just smoking half a cigarette everytime. Smoke half at a time, remove the burning portion, put it aside, re-ignite and finishing it maybe 2~3 hours later when i get the crave again, by doing this im targeting to further cut daily consumption in half. 

But i heard myth that when a half-finished cigarette is re-ignited, it produce a LOT MORE harmful substance, that its better to just throw the remaining half away?? Is this true??

I know i know... You may say i should just quit cold turkey, or i should just throw the remaining half away, but no, just no... I respect these responses, i dont know why but... just no... 

So please, just answer my question please, is re-igniting and smoking a half-smoked cigarette more harmful comparing to smoking a half of a new cigarette?

Thanks...

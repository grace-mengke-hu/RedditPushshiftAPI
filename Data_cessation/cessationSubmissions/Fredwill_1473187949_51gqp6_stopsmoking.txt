OK I smoked I didn't like it I'm not doing this for the rest of my life

Had 3 cigs under the car seat broke my commitment and tried one now I am starting again but I didn't really enjoy it.  I'm 52 years old and I'm not going to be a slave to this addiction again.  I needed to post something out of respect to everyone on this sub. Just destroyed the other 2 and feeling stronger again.

I want to quit

Hey, im new here. I started smoking regularly about a year ago. I dont think its a coincidence that it was around the same time one of my closest friends died. i think i picked up the addiction as a way to deal with the day to day or at least get a daily escape. Ive experimented with a lot of drugs and have smoked pot semi-regularly but i havent had any real problems with drugs or addiction, that is till i started smoking cigs. Now that a bit of time has passed since my life kind of went to shit ive been trying to get everything back on track and i think im ready to quit. I reach the age of majority next month and i want to get in the quitting mindset before i can legally buy cigs whenever i want. All of my friends and family either dont smoke or arent seriously trying to quit so i need some like-minded people to share with. I want to get this shit out of my life, so if you all have any tips to start with, id really appreciate it.

Day 4 - Doing OK but when will the feels stop???

Hello! First post here, first I just want to say that I've been lurking here since I quit a few days ago, and it has proved a very, very valuable source of information, so, thanks everyone! Now for my own personal little problems :

I switched to vaping, so I'm still getting a good dose of nicotine every day, but I've been crying my eyes out for no reasons. I cried this morning as I woke up, because... Everything is SO sad... yeah for no reason basically.  

I know it's supposedly because of MAOI or whatevs that acted as antidepressants and I have to wait for my brain chemistry to rebalance itself. But if anyone can contribute with their own experience, I'd feel better & more prepared if I had a vague idea of how long it's going to take, in weeks/months. I read that exercise was great, so I started going to yoga classes again, and I'm trying to avoid sweets because I'm pretty sure I'd end up with a new addiction real fast. If you have other tips/suggestions please share!

Also... as a side note... what's up with the nicotine hate? I thought the dangerous part of smoking is inhaling burnt smoke + all the extra shit they put in. Also no one has ever become addicted to the patches (AFAIK) so, what's the deal? Am I missing something?

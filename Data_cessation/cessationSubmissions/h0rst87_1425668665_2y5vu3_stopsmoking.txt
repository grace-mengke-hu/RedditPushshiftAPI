12 years of a pack a day, about to quit

Taking the plunge and attempting to quit for the 4th time. I stumbled across /r/stopsmoking and it appears to be a great resource. I have some left in a pack, but this weekend either tonight or in the morning tomorrow is going to be time to quit. I'm 27, and my spouse and I are about to have our first child. I want to be a non-smoker when he is born! I'll submit for a badge tonight or tomorrow and hope that all of us in here trying to make a change for the better have success!

3 weeks in I had the worst craving yet

Today celebrates day 21 of being smoke free.

But last night I had a terrible craving for cigarettes. I was dreaming about smoking and woke up in the middle of the night (like 3:30 ish) craving a cigarette like no other. Fortunately I could only muster the energy to roll over. Also it was late enough that there was nowhere I could get a pack from even if I wanted to. But it did keep me up for a good hour and a half.

The good news is that I'm still smoke free

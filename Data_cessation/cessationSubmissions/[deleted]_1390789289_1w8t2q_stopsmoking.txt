What kept you smoking?

Around 1.5 months gone with what I considered from day 1 my final quit and I still have moments where I rationalize smoking to some extent.

I've discovered my biggest logical flaw was the belief that there is a 'perfect' quit, one where there is no cravings, no lingering desires and a total clean break from smoking. Something every smoke gets once in their lifetime. So I would always use that as an excuse to smoke and further 'study' my addiction.

Now I'm realizing that perhaps there is no 'perfect' quit, the closest thing is when you feel confident enough to say you are finished and actually mean it. I know I had a mental line where I believed once I crossed it I would quit for good, yet I feared it as failing would make it somehow less real.

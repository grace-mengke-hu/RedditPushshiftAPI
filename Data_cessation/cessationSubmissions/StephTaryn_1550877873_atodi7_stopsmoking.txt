Different ex smokers

I think there are two types of ex smokers, but I’m in the ex smoker group that will always know they are a smoker at heart and in their soul but know they can’t and won’t ever do it again so will always miss it a bit. Just over 6 months since my last cigarette so I am over the physical cravings, but really miss the old days of the 80s, which included being accepted as a smoker. It was a normal thing then - we could smoke in bars, restaurants, buses, trains and even other people’s houses! I also miss the community feeling of joining other smokers (even if it was a terrible thing for our health to do but we could moan about being made to go outside and reflect on the old days together).
Ah well we know quitting the cigs is for the best..! Another thing we don’t have a choice but to say goodbye to.

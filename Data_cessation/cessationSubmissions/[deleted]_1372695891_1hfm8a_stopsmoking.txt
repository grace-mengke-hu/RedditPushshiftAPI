Quit smoking weed & dry eyes. Any similar reactions?

I quit smoking weed last week and I've had pretty moderate dry eye since. It's quite ironic if you ask me. I usually eat hemp seeds as part of my diet but still have yet to get some more and I read that omegas play an important in tear production. To try and curb this I got some flax seed and will order more hemp seed soon. Anyone else have this ironic reaction? I'm going to make an appoint to go to the doctor here soon.

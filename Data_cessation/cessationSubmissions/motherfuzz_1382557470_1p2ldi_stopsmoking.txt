51 Days! Some moments are MUCH harder than others....

Like right now, and pretty much all of the last 3 days.

Backstory - I work in the music business, and this requires me to go to shows/events pretty regularly. I used to smoke like a chimney at these events, and I even relied on cigarettes as an ice-breaker and conversation starter. Over the last week, I've had to go to 4 shows, and even though I haven't smoked at all at any of those shows, today feels like only the second or third day quitting. 

The cravings went away for a little bit, and I almost got to a point where I didn't notice them, however that's not the case this week. For some reason, yesterday and today I've felt like I could kill for a cigarette, and the cravings are not really subsiding! 

I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced waves of strong cravings like this, or if this is directly tied to the level of activity I've had this week, etc... 

This is probably the first time since I've quit that I've really started questioning if I actually want to do this or if I even can.

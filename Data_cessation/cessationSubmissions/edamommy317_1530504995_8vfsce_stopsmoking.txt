Planning to quit

I’m ready to quit. I’ve been smoking for 15 years, but I have slowly cut out the times that I smoke. I don’t smoke at work or in my car. I’ve stopped smoking before 9:00 pm, so I’m down to about 2 per day. After my nightly glass of wine is when I go. Alcohol is my trigger, but I’m ready to be done. None of my friends know I smoke, and I have a trip planned with one of them. That will be my quit date. I’m ready to be done with this. Any tips for getting through this are welcome. I never have cravings if I’m not drinking, so I don’t plan to drink much on the trip. I’ve asked my husband to remove all ashtrays and lighters while I’m gone. He quit 2 months ago.

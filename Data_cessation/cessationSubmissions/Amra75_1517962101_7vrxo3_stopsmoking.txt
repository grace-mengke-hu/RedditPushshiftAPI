Spent about 5 minutes looking for my cigarettes this morning. I quit a week ago...

It was before coffee was ready and I was a bit groggy. I didn't even want one but I guess there are more habits to break than the obvious ones. Laughed at myself for a little while and my coffee tasted really good all by itself.

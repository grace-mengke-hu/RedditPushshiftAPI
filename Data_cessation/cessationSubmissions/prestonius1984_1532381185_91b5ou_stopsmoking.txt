NRT advice needed - 4mg gums

Hi all, this is my first post here. Today I made it to full two weeks with no smoke or vape. The 4mg gums have been great help, but I'm concerned about the fact that I like the nicotine kick they give me very much. In fact, I like it to much. I'm still so addicted to the nicotine. 

I am looking for some advice please. 

1. When should I start cutting the strength of them down, or perhaps it's best to leave it for now? 
2. Should I use gums only at particular times (say every hour) or whenever I want as long as I don't exceed the recommended daily dose?

Thanks in advance.

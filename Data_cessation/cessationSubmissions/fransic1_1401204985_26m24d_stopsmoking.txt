How we did it

Well after 4 failures in 6 months this is how we did it, my gf and I have been trying for 6 months to quit together using patches first then champix and never got past week 1 .So we decided to stagger our quit dates , I took champix for two weeks before my stop date and she continued to smoke , because of this she was able to support me through the difficult first few days of stopping , I even encouraged her to smoke in the house ,which we never do as I found it very difficult knowing she was at the back door smoking , she took her champix two weeks after me , now I've done my first month smoke free and she is going into her third week.
It shouldn't work but it is for us, 
Just thought I'd share cos were very proud at the moment .

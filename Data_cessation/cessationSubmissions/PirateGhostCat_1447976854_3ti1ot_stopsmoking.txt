Strep Throat, using it to quit?

Well, I got diagnosed with strep throat - man this is painful! 

I have been thinking of quitting for so long. Thinking I will use this as my jump off point. I havent smoked in 2 days. Seems like I'm surely past some of the bad part. 

Also wondering , should I get the patch? Just to be sure I dont smoke??

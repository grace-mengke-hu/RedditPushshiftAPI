13 days

I think this time might be for good. I’ve quit before - for one day, three days, one year, two years a few times- but always started again. This time I have a reason besides just myself, I want to be there for my kids as long as I can. I was an older mom (39) so now that I’m approaching 50 I can see how bad habits take their toll over time. I also love how I can smell better again, spring flowers in the air. Taking deep breaths. Every time I have a craving (often) I do deep breathing and focus on my kids. Graduation. Wedding. Grandkids. Being there for them. It is hard, I miss being young and listening to music and smoking and feeling “cool.” Now I’m chewing gum and blowing obnoxious big bubbles and trying to let that old part of myself go.

I quit smoking because of possible disease (not cancer)

Hi,

im 24, and i smoked since i was about 13. I stopped smoking now since 5 months, didnt light up a single one. 

For my own reason, i have to explain a little bit.

My mother has "Chorea Huntington", she is now 52. Its a really bad disease, which kicks in at about 39 years, and your nerves and brain start to die over the years.  So you lose memories, and normal motion functions and so on. She is still alive, but she doesnt even recognize me anymore.

I have the possibility to get that disease too, the chance is about 50%. Its possible to test if i will get that, but i dont want to, since this would make my life a countdown to 40th birthday. 

In May my uncle died after 3 years of suffering on leukemia (blood cancer). It was very sad, at the funeral, he had a happy life.

On the day of his funeral i suddenly had that sudden inspiration:
**If i escape that Huntingon-disease, it would be very sad if i die on cancer some years later.**

Maybe someone has a simliar situation, you can think about it.

I am very comfortable atm after the 5 months not smoking, the smoke is even disgusting for me now since a while. I am sure i will never go back to smoking again, since this would completely betray my principles.

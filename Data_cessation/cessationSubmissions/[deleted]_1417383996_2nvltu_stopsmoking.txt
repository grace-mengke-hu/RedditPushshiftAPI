I had a cigarette and it was nasty...and I feel bad.

So I had been off cigarettes for a few days. Just smoked one cause it was right in front of me, and it was nasty! I'm so glad I'm done with them. I sent a message to badgebot to update my quit date and hopefully that goes through but I honestly feel like I'm finally out! I feel so free!

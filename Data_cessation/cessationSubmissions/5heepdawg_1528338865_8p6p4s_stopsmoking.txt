Day 2 "cold turkey" aka 1$ coupon for vape.

So I haven't touched a cig in 2 days. It may sound stupid, or perhaps against the rules but I got a coupon for a vape from speedway gas station for a Vuse starter kit. It came with tobacco or menthol flavor. I decided to buy nectar flavor pods. My gf smokes cigs in front of me and we drink. I however, have not had a cig in 2 days.  Also I'm okay with her doing it.
  
It may not seem like much, but to me it's a start. Thanks to you all, and other people in my day to day life. Saw my fingernails were yellow today. Never really noticed, but always heard the rumor. Had to share it. I guess little victories = major accomplishments. Tha is for reading.  
  
I've had cravings, but haven't caved to them. Feels pretty nice.

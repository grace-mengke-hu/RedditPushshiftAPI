Smoke at work; don't smoke at home.

Hi r/stopsmoking,

I have been smoking for years on and off.  About 6 months ago I graduated and started working at my current job, it is very stressful to say the least.  When I'm here (remote work site), I constantly smoke and cannot stop myself.  When I get home for my week off, Ill go 5 days without smoking and not even think about it.  As soon as I get to this camp my body and mind just need the ciggy.

Has anyone ever been in a similar scenario and if so any suggestions for quitting fulltime, baring quitting my job.

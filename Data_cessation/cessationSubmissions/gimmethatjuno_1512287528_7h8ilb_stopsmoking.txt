Close to losing to the nicotine

Today was my 100th day of no cigarettes or smoking of any kind. In about 9 years, this is the longest I've made it. This is at least my 5th or 6th time quitting, with my previous longest quit being about a month or so several years ago. 

These past two days I've been feeling really high-strung. I've been feeling careless and ready to just get back on the smoking grind. I'm not even craving cigarettes, although I know this is where that would lead. I'm craving rollies, and keep getting an urge to go buy a packet of tobacco. 

I know it's not going to do me any good and I've been able to put it off, but I feel my willpower leaving me. I have this romanticized picture of smoking in my head. The reality is that it is disgusting. It makes me smell bad, it forces me to take a break every hour, it doesn't even taste good. 

But I still want it so bad. I'm travelling to new york at the end of the month. I can't stop thinking about being able to smoke during my trip. Before I board. After I board. Every which way in between. 

It's been difficult these past 100 days, but there have been stretches where i didn't even think about smoking. I felt confident, and aside from one instance where I took my lighter into my car wth me with the intention of buying a pack (I didnt), I havent thought I was going to fail. 

I no longer smell like an ashtray and I can exercise for extended periods without feeling like death. But I've become so stressed that I don't give a fuck about my health right now. I want my escape back. I have so much pent up frustration inside me and my usual outlets (exercise) arent cutting it anymore.

I don't know where I'm going with this, sorry if I triggered anyone. I'm just low key freaking out about it, I feel like i'm going to give in soon. Like I'm one stressful event away from throwing it all away.

Thanks for reading or whatever

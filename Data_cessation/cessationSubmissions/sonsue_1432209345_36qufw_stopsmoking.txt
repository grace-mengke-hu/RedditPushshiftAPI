Some Questions for the Moderator's and Member's of /r/stopsmoking

Why do we not have popular links in our sidebar? I understand that perhaps linking to Allen Carr's video could be a copyright issue but there are a ton of other resources that are recommended here all the time where that would not be an issue. John Polito's [Freedom From Nicotine](http://whyquit.com/ffn/) for instance. Perhaps a list of Apps we have used, open source informative videos etc.. 

Maybe it is a conscious choice to keep conversation going. I don't know. Just curious to see what you guys thought. If it was something we wanted we could probably sticky a thread and upvote the resources we thought were most valuable.

Edit: I don't understand. How can no moderators answer this?

Keep fighting the good fight!

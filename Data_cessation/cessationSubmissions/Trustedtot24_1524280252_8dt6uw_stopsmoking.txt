Think of quitting Nicotine

Hey! Just discovered this wonderful little subreddit.

I've technically already quit cigarettes (two years ago actually) but the thing is I replaced it with vaping. While being generally viewed as less harmful (despite the fact we don't have enough studies into long-term effects of it) it's still a habit that's potentially just as harmful. I'm just tired if it all, I'm tired if it warping my view of the world. I'm tired of it controlling my life. And I'm just tired of it being something as of right now have seemingly no control over.

I want to quit.

I have many, many stressful things to deal with presently, and I don't believe it would be the best to put the stress of quitting in myself at a time like this. Deep down I know that part of this thought process is just the sheer terror of what it is like to go through the process of giving up nicotine. Despite this I believe it's rational to free up just one of the other stresses first before giving it a go. I'll post here again in 2 months (specifically June 20th)

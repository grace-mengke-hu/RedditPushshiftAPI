I only smoke when I drink because I get anxious, looking for help.

Hi there,

I (23/M) go out drinking every Saturday with my friends and thats the only time I smoke most of the time (Go through 15-20 cigs each Saturday night). Most of my friends do it which I think adds to why I do too, but I don't particularly like it. I don't smoke to relieve stress, I think I'm doing it because of anxiety. I'm shy and an introvert so I like to join in and not stand out to avoid random conversation. Or if I've nothing to say, i take one out to look busy and not just be staring at whoever is talking with no replies or input whatsoever. Or if I'm by myself I do it so I'm doing something so I don't look awkward standing there doing nothing, as I'm bad going up to girls etc. I've no desire to smoke when I'm sober throughout the week but feel as if I really need them the second I have my first drink. 

Has anyone else experienced this or know how to stop in this situation? I really want to stop as I don't enjoy it, it just seems to distract me from how awkward I am in social situations. Needless to say, spending money on something I don't have to do or enjoy at all isn't a great feeling at all.

panic attacks with quitting?

 I've been a heavy smoker (at least a pack a day) for about 15 years now.  Last Thursday, I did some stuff (I'd rather not say) that led to me being in the hospital on Friday.  The doctor said I came very close to having a heart attack, and needed to quit smoking immediately.

  I've wanted to quit for years and previous attempts have failed.  Since leaving the hospital, I've limited myself to under 5 per day but I can't bring myself to completely quit.  I get terrible panic attacks and my mind goes into the mode of "panicking is worse for your heart than one little cigarette".  How can I combat this thinking?  I can't keep going like this- I WANT TO LIVE!!!  

Any support/advice/kind words would be very much appreciated.  I've read through a lot of the threads in this sub, and I feel much more mentally prepared than I was a few days ago, but I can't shake the panic attacks.

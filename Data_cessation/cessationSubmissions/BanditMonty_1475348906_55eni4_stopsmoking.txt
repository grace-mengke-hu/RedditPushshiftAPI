Today is my quit date.

I started smoking when I was 20 after I joined the military. I turned 30 in August and I told myself I didn't want to smoke into my thirties. I feel like I am taking all the right steps to quit for good: Quit plan, NRT, changing people places and things, and support from the friends/family. I am very glad I found this sub because reading other people posting about quitting helps my confidence. Today is my quit date, and from here on out I am a non-smoker.

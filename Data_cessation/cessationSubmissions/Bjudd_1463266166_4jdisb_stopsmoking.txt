I just hit a week! Wow I feel fantastic! It is so worth it.

I quit last Saturday, because I came to the point where I hated the habit so bad I just decided to give it up; and I smoked roughly half a pack a day! I was smoking on and off for roughly 4 years. I never really had good support quitting because all my friends smoke, and my girlfriend still smokes. However, after finding Reddit over a year ago and hanging out here secretly it gave me a lot of ambition. I thank you reddit. 

So far I can breath better, smell and taste better, I feel more calm and relaxed, and I've already started jogging. 

The only downfall I'm experiencing is slight insomnia, but that's worth it for the rest of the benefits!

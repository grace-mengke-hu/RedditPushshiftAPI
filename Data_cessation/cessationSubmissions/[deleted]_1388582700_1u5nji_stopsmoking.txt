quitting at last!

Not sure if anyone will reply to this because I'm definitely not the only one quitting in the New Year. 
I started when I was thirteen. (Disgusting, I know) I'm now nineteen. Just broke up with my SO of three years and because I have depression I guess one of my resolutions is to just focus more in myself  excersise more, care more about myself and my body, etc. and I guess smoking comes under that. I'm dying for a cigarette right now though! Good luck to everyone on this journey. I'd like to be smoke free by the time I'm. 20! Happy new year everyone!

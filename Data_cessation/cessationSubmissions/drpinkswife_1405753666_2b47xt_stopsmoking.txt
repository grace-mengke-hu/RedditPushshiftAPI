How Am I Doing?

Shit really. But I'm not going to smoke over it. Look it's a 4 on my badge! I'm making all these changes and my SO is not talking to me. Why? Well he'd have to talk to me for me to know that. We were having an argument two days ago? Then there was the veiled 'don't upset me' threat from him. Pardon? What does that mean? And he's said like two words to me since. Mostly by text. Sorry, I guess I'm using this forum wrongly. But things are shit and I'm going to keep moving forward. I'm stubborn as hell and I won't smoke over this! I feel this way 95% of the time! The other 5%...not so good. :(

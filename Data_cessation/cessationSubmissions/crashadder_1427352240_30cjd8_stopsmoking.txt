help needed

I am struggling for the last couple of days. I have no  idea what causes this. I still think about smoking all the time. I am pretty sure i wont cave in at this point but  i constantly find myself thinking how nice it'd be to end this battle and enjoy life again. Its just that i am tired of this fight. It is stupid i know. I red Allen Carr in 2 different languages twice. I know it gets better in time. But then some days it feels like you are back to square one. This makes me think maybe i am meant to smoke. I go out partying and dont even think about smoking. At work vast majority of my friends chain smoke which doesnt bother me at all. But it just wont heal. I dont want to be a smoker again. I also want to be happy

284 cigarettes not smoked and almost 24 days

I have been losing track of the time I have been a nonsmoker. Rarely any cravings except for when I got into a car accident recently.. I talked myself down and took hits of my vape... I feel tons better, got a gym membership at my university. Life is really going well. I am excited to see all my friends who all complained about me smoking and smelling awful... now they will have nothing to complain about.

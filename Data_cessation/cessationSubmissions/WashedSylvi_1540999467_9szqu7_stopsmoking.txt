Planning to quit nicotine January 1st

Waddup.

I switched to vaping from cigarettes a while back, but I want off this train. I'm tired of cravings and nausea and acid reflux and a parched throat. I'm tired of spending money and wondering what people are thinking of me.

What advice can y'all give me to setup my quit time so I'm successful? I've quit so many drugs before this, nicotine is one of my last substances (and coffee). I'm a little afraid.

On Day 2! Never made it this far before!

I've been smoking for 14 years and this is my umpteenth time attempting to quit, but my first time attempting to quit cold turkey!

The Marketing Director at my office made me this card to sit on my computer for motivation, it is really helping:

"I have a big goal that I'm trying to reach in a short time. 
I really want above everything else to see myself reach this goal. 
I will do what it takes for this short period of time to reach this goal. 
I CAN and MUST and WILL stick to the plan for victory!"

UPDATE: 01.29.14 10:51AM (PST) - I am still going strong! Thank you again for all the encouraging words, they are really helping!

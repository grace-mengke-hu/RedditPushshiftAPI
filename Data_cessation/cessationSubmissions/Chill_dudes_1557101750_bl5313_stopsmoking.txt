I just want to cry!!!

This is my millionth attempt at stopping it's only been like 10 hours and I wanna cry and scream and lose my shit, IM SO ANGRY! Last time wasn't like this I was way more calm idk what the difference is.
 Ky Fiance is also quitting and bless his poor heart I wanna kill him and love him, I'm all over the place but I feel like if I cave I'll never quit.  GEEEZ Louise guys!!

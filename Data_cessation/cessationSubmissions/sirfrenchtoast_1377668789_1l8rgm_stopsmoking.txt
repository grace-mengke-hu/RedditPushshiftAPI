When will I stop craving?

I was a smoker for 3 years (I'm nearly 19 now), and quit 9 days ago - I still spend a large majority of my day wishing I could have a cigarette or having to avoid catching up with certain friends as I just spend the whole time agitated and craving. 
To be honest, I miss being a smoker

I guess I was just hoping someone on here might have some insight

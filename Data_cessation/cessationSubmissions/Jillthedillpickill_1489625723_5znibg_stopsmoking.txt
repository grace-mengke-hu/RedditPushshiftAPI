Saint Patrick's Day

I will have 3 years of no smoking on Saint Patrick's Day. I want to tell you what I know. First of all you can do it. It is worth it,you are worth it. You don't physically need cigarettes to live. It is worth it. It will get easier. If you need help ask for it from your doctor , a support group or both.

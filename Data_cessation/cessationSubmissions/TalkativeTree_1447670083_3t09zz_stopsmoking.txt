Giving to others instead of killing ourselves

I had a thought while watching a homeless man asking for change talk to another man smoking a cigarette. What if everyone that currently smokes decided to take the money they will spend on killing themselves and spend it on help others. 

So if you've quit, or are thinking of quitting, ask yourself what you could do with that money instead. Maybe save it up and do reddit's secret santa. Maybe it's donating to a foodbank. Maybe it's buying a gym membership and getting back in shape (loving/taking care of yourself counts as well!). Take a second to close your eyes and imagine yourself having done that and quit smoking. 

Here's the hard part. Actually doing it. Post in the comments how you will spend money instead of on cigarettes. In 30 days, I'll ping everyone here to see how things have gone. If you're struggling in those 30 days, message me or just ask for help.

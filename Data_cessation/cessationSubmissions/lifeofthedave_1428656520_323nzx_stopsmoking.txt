Help me guys

I've been smoking for 9 years now. I currently smoke around a pack a day and I've tried to quit numerous times. The most I've been able to go without them in the recent couple years is about 3 days. I always end up caving due to completely stupid reasons. I'm unfortunately a delivery driver and I can not for the life of me see a possibility of not having a cigarette while I'm driving. What should I do? I've tried slowing down gradually (but always go right back up), I tried substitutions of many different things, cold turkey, patches, and tried with a buddy and a parent. Why is this so difficult and why can't I keep my will up enough to do this...?

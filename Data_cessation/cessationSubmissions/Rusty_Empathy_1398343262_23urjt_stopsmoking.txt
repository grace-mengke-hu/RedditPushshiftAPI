Alternatives to Chantix?

Hello everyone, 

I'm 38 and started smoking when I was 14. I was able to quit smoking for 4 years using Chantix...but like an idiot bummed a smoke from someone at work a year and a half ago and now I'm right back to a pack and a half a day. 

Contacted my dr to see about getting another prescription for Chantix but she was extremely reluctant to do so as I have also been suffering from a deep depression for the past 2 years and well, apparently that stuff makes it worse. 

I've never been able to quit cold turkey before- the discomfort and anxiety I feel always leads me right back. 

What are some alternatives? Does anyone have any suggestions? I am really getting tired of being a smoker and just want to be able to stop!

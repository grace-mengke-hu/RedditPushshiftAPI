Still smoking? Here's a tip!

I'm on the verge of stopping, but fear of freaking out at my high stress job is stopping me.

Anyway, something that's really helped is a trial run on cessation nation. I had an intense urge to quit Sunday during a vicious  smoking induced migraine, so I started the app at that time.  While I didn't quit smoking, I am able to see what benefits I would already be receiving had I actually stopped. Makes me feel more apt to quit.

Sorry if this isn't new, just thought it was interesting.

**tl;dr** start a quit smoking app before you quit, see what you're missing out on.

I cannot believe I made it till here. Yesterday I was with my BF in a supermarket and when it was our turn to get to the cashier, I saw the big amount of cigarettes she had behind her sit and I was like “wow, it’s amazing that seeing this doesn’t affect me right now.” Of course, my bf couldn’t understand because he never smoked any in his life but he is still supportive :). 
However, I still have the thinking from time to time that I would never feel the feeling it gives to  smoke again , and it makes me a little sad. I loved it so much. Well , till now I m still able to resist. 
Just a lil update.

Inspiration from a different kind of addict

My mother-in-law's morbidly obese best friend said this during a Weight Watcher's meeting about his relationship with food. I read this with "cigarettes" in place of "food" and it's had a profound impact on how I view my habit. I hope his words can help someone else here too:

> I tell people that it sometimes it feels like food is an illicit, abusive lover. I've snuck around to be with it, I've lied for it, I've suffered for it, I've sacrificed my health for it, I've struggled for each breath to be with it. I've planned my days and nights around it, I've given up opportunities for it, and I've thrown my money away in pursuit of it; I've cried over it. 
> 
> I have lived years of my life in physical pain and mental anguish over the love of it. I've spent more time, tears, money, and heartache over it for YEARS-- all for the love of something that CANNOT LOVE ME BACK. 
> 
> I finally had enough. 
> 
> It's been a tough breakup, and it still shows up every now and then--- but I'm getting better at not answering the door. 

This guy has already lost 110 pounds. For the first time in fifteen years, his weight begins with a 3, not a 4. His success came at the cost of unimaginable amounts of hardship and work.

And all I have to do is not give in and buy another pack.

We can beat this.

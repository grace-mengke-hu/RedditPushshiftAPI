Should I even be proud?

My last cigarette was on Friday morning of last week. I feel happy that in over 10 years I can say I'm almost a week cigarette free. Before this quit, I had never gone even 1 day without having a cigarette. 

But, I've been using Juul. Once in the morning, after work, on my dog walks and before bed. Sometimes I'll take a puff or two at work if I'm stressed. So, does this take away from my accomplishment? Can I even say I quit smoking? Am I allowed in this group?

Tested myself yesterday and passed.

I invited a smoking friend to game, drink beer and chill. He didn't know I had quit. When he arrived he complained about the hail and asked me if I wanted to join him on the balcony for a pre game smoke. I replied with 'sure you may smoke'. He was a bit puzzeled and asked if I had quit. I just smiled and proceeded to the balcony. Every time he went to have smoke I woud join him and I did not smoke once! Had a few cravings of course but I resisted them well.

I'm beginning a life as a non- smoker!

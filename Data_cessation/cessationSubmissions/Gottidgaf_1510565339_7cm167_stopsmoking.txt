Mostly success so far

Sorry for not lurking moar, hope I'm not screwing up, anxious to talk on this subject.

I made it I think 35 days no smoke using patches. I often go to a bar where people smoke outside. I'm becoming friends with patrons, and about a week ago found myself bumming my first cigarette in a while. No big deal, right? Well since then I've had a cigarette a day, sometimes every other day or two, sometimes more than one during a day but never more than three. Today I've had I think four and it's likely I'll have one more before bed.

I don't like giving second hand smoke to my girlfriend so I want to stay quit as much as I can...any advice/tips on continuing the quit-train based on my experience so far? Anything appreciated, much thanks, and keep it up to all the quiters who choose quiting! (el-oh-el)

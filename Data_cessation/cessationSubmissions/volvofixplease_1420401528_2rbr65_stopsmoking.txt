This seriously sucks

I finally managed to get my much needed sleep and i feel like this was the last ive seen from insomnia but i feel like such a tool:today i woke up feeling like the best shit in the world,with so much confidence and self-respect,i started laughing at the fact that i was ever a smoker but now...literally the only thing keeping me from lighting up is my sexy badge :( not only am i incapable of thinking straight but the craving attacks me without warning and lasts way longer than five minutes

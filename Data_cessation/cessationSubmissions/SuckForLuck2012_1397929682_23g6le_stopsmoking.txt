How can I get my Mom to stop smoking?

I have told her over and over the numerous risks of smoking and she tells me not to worry about it. My Dad offered her a new car in turn for quitting smoking, since it would bring in a reasonable amount of money. She gets extremely defensive when we mention it to her. I'm only 15, she is 36 and has smoked since she was 18. Goes through two or so packs a day. I want her to stop so bad. Any ideas? Thank you all in advance.

Today is the day

with the help of Nicoderm CQ I'm attempting to quit smoking. My husband is thrilled; I on the other hand am not as optimistic about the outcome as he is. I've smoked since I was 12. I'm 29 now. Realistically I know this is what needs to be done but I always give in to the addiction. How do I get myself in the quitters mind frame so that I am successful? Help!!

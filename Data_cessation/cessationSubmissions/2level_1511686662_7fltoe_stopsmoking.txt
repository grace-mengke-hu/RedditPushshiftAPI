The STD approach

I have realized that I applied that approach when trying to quit.
**Search. Try. Discard.**  I searched the information available. I tried the information through applying it to my life. If it helped I kept it. If there was no improvement I discarded it.

This forum, the book"freedom from nicotine", www.whyquit.com, Allen Carr's "Easy Way to Stop Smoking" and the internet helped me.
The forum provided also support, practical knowledge and help me spotting self deceiving  thoughts. 

Quit smoking apps also helped by showing health achievements and by logging cravings (logging cravings was liberatory, as I were doing something about them), the "smoke free" app allowed to log the time and intensity. Without that app I couldn't realize that the frequency was decreasing.

Take care

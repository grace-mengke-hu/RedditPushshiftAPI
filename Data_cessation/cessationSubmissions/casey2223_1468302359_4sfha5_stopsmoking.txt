Some advice please !

I'm on day 3 today, I'm doing it with the aid of patches this time. I was a pack a day smoker for the past 15 years and I really don't want to let it win. I have a day off work today and instead of doing productive things I just keep laying down in bed, trying to stop the thoughts of smoking. One thing that I'm scared of is that I won't enjoy the little things in life that I used to such as going out for dinner, I keep imagining that it won't be the same because I can't smoke or going on a holiday, I keep thinking that I won't enjoy it because I can't smoke. Will my thoughts change in time?

I was never even "a smoker", and yet...

I am having cravings that are crazy strong, but I've never been "a smoker", just a few when drunk or hanging out with certain friends. I'm more likely to smoke weed than cigarettes, and yet the cravings are starting to get stronger and stronger every day. I haven't smoked in months but I'm about to go buy a pack right now. I know that's how it starts but it's incredibly hard to not give in. 

I'm not a smoker yet, and I don't want to be.

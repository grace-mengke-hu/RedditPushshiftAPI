How bad is the withdrawal after a relapse?

After 86 hours without nicotine I relapsed. I thankfully didn't buy any smokes just bumed drags off of people at a party last night. No I'm back on the horse but I'm scared that I'm gonna go through withdrawal again. Is withdrawal after a relapse as bad as it was the first time?

Does "I'm quitting smoking" ever become "I've quit smoking"? 

I smoked my last cigarette on 12/17/12, 46 days ago. I feel incredible-- so much healthier, and it gets better every day. I'm really proud of myself, and I no longer have urges to smoke every day (sometimes while drinking they're fleeting, but they go away). 

Despite this, I'm still petrified to say I've quit, because it feels like a never ending process. I'm afraid one day I'll relapse and all of my work will be for nothing, and all of my friends who supported me will be disappointed. Am I wrong in thinking this? How do you guys deal with the fear of slip-ups?

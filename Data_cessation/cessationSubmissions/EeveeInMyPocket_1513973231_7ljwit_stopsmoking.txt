Advice please!

My husband and I have been together for 8 years. He's been a smoker for 10ish, I've been smoking for 5ish years. We are both quitting this week and today is day 1 without any cigs, and needless to say we are a bit... antsy/irritated. Any advice for how we can keep our cool and get through this with our heads held high?

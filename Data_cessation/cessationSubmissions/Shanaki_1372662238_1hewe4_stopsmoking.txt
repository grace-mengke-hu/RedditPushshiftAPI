Enough is enough, I need some serious help.

I've quit about 3 times now. Every time I seem to quit, someone close to me is either killed/passes away. It's hard, but now things are getting ridiculous.

I'm starting to steal money from my parents who are only trying to help me with a place while I'm jobless and looking for work. I can't find a job for the life of me and Arizona Unemployment offices are being stingy as fuck. I have no money, and even sold a bunch of my stuff just to be able to get a carton and some food.

I'm not a thief though... I despise myself for taking money from my parents but this addiction is taking control of me and now I need it to stop before it just continues. I don't trust myself anymore...

I won't be able to quit cold turkey, I've done it before but those were different times, different circumstances. I need help...

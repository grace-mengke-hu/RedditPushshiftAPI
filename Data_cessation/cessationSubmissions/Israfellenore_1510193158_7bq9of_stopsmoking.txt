My last attempt failed, but I’m more determined now

My last attempt failed. I barely lasted a week smoke-free. The patches gave me horrible muscle cramps and is was so easy for me to slip back into old habits and use excuse after excuse. “I’m bored”, “I’m stressed”, “I need it”. 


I’m done now. For real. I’ve washed all my clothes that smell like smoke, all the lighters are gone, I’ve downloaded Smoke Free, and my pack is thrown out.  

I’m going to do this. For real this time. It’s going be hard and it’s going to suck but *I got this*.

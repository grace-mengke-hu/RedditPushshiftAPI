Day 12, felt crazy mood swings today and yesterday

I'm doing really good quitting nicotine, but I've been super depressed while I'm out. Was a huge negative nancy and it's like my cravings are an actual emotion. I have learned to deal with my nic fits by drinking caffeine, but omg it would not go away no matter how many energy drinks I had today. I have not felt depression this bad in forever, either, until I stopped smoking. A few old friends saw me today and heartily greeted me, but that was a very short lived happy spot.

I always tell myself it'll go away, though. Just glad to have made it to this point, thank you for listening :)

Dreams, man.

I've been a non-smoker for almost 300 days (wooo)!  Lately I have been having these dreams where I'm smoking.  I had these dreams early on, but they are becoming more frequent now.  It's funny because when I'm dreaming it always starts with me having one cig, and by the end of the dream I'm a chain smoking sap, just like I used to be in real life.  I am a very happy non-smoker, so maybe these dreams keep happening to remind me why I quit.  Or it's the nicotine monster still somewhere deep inside my head saying "just one".  Well, fuck you, nicotine monster.  Never again.  Keep it up everyone!

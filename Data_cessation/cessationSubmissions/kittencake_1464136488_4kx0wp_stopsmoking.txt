Feeling strong!

First of all, I have a confession to make. I posted here more than a year ago, insisting that I was stopping. Many of you left me lovely supportive comments. That quit attempt lasted less than twenty-four hours. 

In the time since, I have lost two family friends, very quickly, to lung cancer. My Dad underwent surgery to remove a cancer from his lung in November last year. Thankfully he is recovering well. 

None of this was enough to make me stop, apparently. In a way it just made me smoke more, miserable and angry with myself. 

But last week something in my head just clicked. It's been almost a week now. I feel great. Some of the cravings have been seriously hardcore, but they're so short lived, and I feel so proud of myself every time I exercise my mental fortitude. 

So now I want to thank you all for the support you offered me before, even though I didn't deserve it, and take my rightful place amongst you instead! Yay!

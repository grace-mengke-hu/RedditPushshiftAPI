I'm done.

I took a breath of my cigarette this morning and I felt so sick of myself. I felt such a sense of disgust. I put the cigarette out halfway smoked in the ashtray.

I began thinking, "How can I do this to my temple? MY temple?!" "How can I let myself rot for a quick cigarette?" "Just how could I?" 

It's not okay for me to be so easily self-coerced into buying more and more of these things. My teeth are not whiter anymore, my clothes and hands stink, my throat hurts, my lungs ache, my heart beats too fast, and that's just the stuff I feel. Imagine what I'm doing to everything? Without my knowing exactly? 

And I know this is technically not even my first day stopping, but I'm done. I'm ready for a better tomorrow. Hell, I'm ready to regain the years I've lost focusing on smoking. 

Any good tips on replacement or to decrease cravings please share. LOL

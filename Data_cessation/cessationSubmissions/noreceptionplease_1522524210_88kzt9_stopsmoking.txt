Anger. Anger. Anger.

It’s been ten days and I’m fucking losing my mind with anger. I can’t go a hour without being on the verge of wanting to fucking rag doll someone. And I’m scared that I’m going to do it. I’m just waiting for someone to step into my space and I’m going to go ape shit. 

And it would all be cured by a smoke. It would. 

Awe fuck.

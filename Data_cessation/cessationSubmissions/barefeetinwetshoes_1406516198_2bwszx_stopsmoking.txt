Starting (again, forever) this semester

I've been smoking since the very start of 2011, pretty heavily since 2012. Last cigarette had on the 26th, my 26th birthday. I'm ready to be not a smoker, I think, and recording it here seems like it might be a good way to hold myself accountable to myself.

I've been reading here for a few months and the community seems like a good one, I look forward to participating.

Any advice on quitting e-cigs?

So I used to smoke cigarettes for some time, and about a year and a half ago I moved over to e-cigs. Right now I’m using a juul, but I feel like I’m more addicted than ever. I was wondering if anyone else had this problem, and how you were able to quit all together. I want to do this for my health, and more importantly for the money I’m spending in it. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

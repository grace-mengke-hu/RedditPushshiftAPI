I really don't feel any better.

I have smoked on and off (mostly on) for 27 years.  A spur of the moment decision, a brief but unsuccessful stint on Champix and here I am 47 days later, cigarette free.  I've shocked my family, and myself too!
The thing is, I really don't feel any better.  My skin is a bit nicer, but I have a VILE taste in my mouth.  
Shouldn't there be something to show for it by now?  (apart from the obvious money, time, freedom from habit)

12 days smoke free!

So I woke up on Tuesday the 5th of March and decided to quit. Walked to my local Vape shop, bought a new vape and started my smoke free journey. I started smoking in August of 2013, I was 14 and had given into curiosity as well as peer pressure. Now at 20, with a daughter and a girlfriend of 4 years I decided to quit. My goal; to stay alive for my daughter, to be able to keep fit and play with her as she grows up. I'm feeling better than ever! Don't get me wrong, I've failed to quit many, many times... However, progress is progress, no matter how small. The average amount of times it takes to quit before being successful is around 10. Some find it easier than others, but it's what works for you. I found that I like the feeling of inhaling something and seeing the smoke leave my mouth. I opted for a vape as it was a cheaper, safer alternative. Some of you can quit cold turkey or use patches, gum or inhalers. Just remember; if you quit, you save yourself money. You save your health. You'll feel better! It'll be hard but I know you can do it! Set a goal and try to stick to it. Achieve it and set another. If you have a set back, just start again! No biggy!

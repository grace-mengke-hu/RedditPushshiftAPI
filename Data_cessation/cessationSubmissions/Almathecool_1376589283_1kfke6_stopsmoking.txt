Day Four

I had been weaning off from three a night to one a night. Then when the last pack ran out, I decided not to throw more money on a habit that makes me hurt and cough.

Smoking since I was thirteen. Now I'm 28. I'm happy but jittery and moody still with cravings. This is rough. Found myself rummaging for snacks. Been reading this sub and slowly gaining the courage to not smoke.

Anyone have advice to keep from gaining weight? How about fighting the cravings. Tips are greatly appreciated.

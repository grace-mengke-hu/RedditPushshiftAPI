18 months cigarette free

And I still have cravings. The newest season of Stranger Things was so full of triggers, watching Hopper and Will's mom smoke in every other scene made me feel so nostalgic for my old habit. I also think the fall weather is a trigger for me, but after all these weeks I know I won't fall for my sneaky brain, telling me "just one won't hurt."

Feel like a raging lunatic

I do not know why, but I felt like  a raging lunatic last night. I hated everyone and I did not want to talk to or be around anyone. I hope I never feel that again! Does anyone else feel like that some times? I'm trying to be happier and enjoy life. Wish I could control it easier. Any suggestions?

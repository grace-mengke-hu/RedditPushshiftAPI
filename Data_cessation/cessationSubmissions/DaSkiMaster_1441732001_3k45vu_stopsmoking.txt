my friend said im instead "taking an extended break"

if you see my day counter, im about 40 days in with no cigs, tobacco, or nicotine, etc 

to me, and id say most people would think so, but i dont say (or think) that i am 'quitting' 

i QUIT....

but my friend i was visiting in college/saw him briefly. him (my ex roommate) and the friend (girl) i was staying with were having a smoke on her balcony, and i said id come out to chill with them/the smoke doesnt bother(or tempt) me anymore, and i said i quit smoking a month ago. his response...

"you havent REALLLYYY quit, you're just taking an extended break. a month is nothing"

hes a really good friend of mine but i honestly wanted to punch him in the face right then and there. i honestly felt insulted

we ALL know, if you smoke, going even 24 hours without a cig is VERY hard to do. 

i need some backup lol

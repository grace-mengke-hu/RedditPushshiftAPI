Almost a week without a smoke. But my dreams still fuck with me.

I just woke up and remembered in my dream I saw a pack of American Spirits (my brand) and I said no to buying a pack. But now I remember that my dream self was going to try and get a lucy from the guy at the counter. I don't remember if I ever smoked in my dream but luckily that wasn't rel life.

You guys ever have dreams like that?

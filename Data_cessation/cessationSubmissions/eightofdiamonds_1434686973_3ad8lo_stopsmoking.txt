Quit today - I want to take it seriously this time

Hi. I quit for days here and there. I quit for almost three years before I went back last fall. I'd like to do this for real this time. I let myself cave really easily instead of pushing myself to stick with it.

This time I'd like to give it my all. I want to smoke, I enjoy it. But I hate how I smell, how I feel, the expense, and what I know it's doing to my health. I keep reasoning that I'm still young. Well mid thirties with over a decade of smoking isn't a kid picking it up for the first time. I'm a smoker, it doesn't matter if I stop here and there, I am a smoker. So I have to quit.

Thanks for any support. I feel like if I hold myself accountable to others it will help.

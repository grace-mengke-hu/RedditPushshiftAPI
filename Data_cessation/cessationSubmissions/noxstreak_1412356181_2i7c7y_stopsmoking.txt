Went to the casino last night...

my goodness smoking smells horrible!!!!  I even started getting light headed.  Normally when I go past a smoker I enjoy that smell so much but this was crazy.  When I smoked I never really noticed...

I am not a quiter as I use an ecig but the smell was intense...  Also my taste are way different...  I really crave vietnamese dishes now when before I was "eh" to them...

Crazy times!

Losing motivation ...

How do you guys find motivation after a lot of failed attempts to stop smoking? I'm trying to get rid of that habbit at the moment, but I'm losing motivation with every failed attempt.

I'm giving it another go from tomorrow and I've decided to not give in this time, but it's really hard in those first days ...

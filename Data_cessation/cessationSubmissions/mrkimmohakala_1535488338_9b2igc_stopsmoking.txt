I thought I had stopped smoking forever. New try this time.

I'm 30 and I've been a smoker since about 12-years old (3 first years were not that active). Been smoking a pack a day (or more) since I was 19. I have many times thought of quitting (surprised about certain people say they never want to quit), and I've also tried plenty of times, most times very unsuccesfully. 

2 years ago, summer of 2016, I quit cold turkey. I was really motivated, the first 1-2 months were really terrible. I was very aggressive and otherwise in a very bad mood. Several months went by without me smoking. 3 months, 6 months, 12 months. I thought, "this is it, I'm not a smoker anymore". A bit more than a year after I had quit, I had a few cigarettes during an evening when I was drinking. A few weeks later I was back to smoking a pack a day, it felt like I had never quit. 

It's about a year ago since I started smoking again. Now I'm finishing off my third day of non-smoking, although with nicotine gum this time. So far it's going really well, just need to remind myself to start chewing before the urge hits in. And also to remind myself that cigarettes are not my friend, but they're actually killing me. 

I'm still a bit unsure about the nicotine gum, as previously I've used Swedish Snus, and just started smoking again directly when my Snus finished. Anyways, it's a great feeling not to smoke (even for a few days), but I hope this time I'm off it for good.

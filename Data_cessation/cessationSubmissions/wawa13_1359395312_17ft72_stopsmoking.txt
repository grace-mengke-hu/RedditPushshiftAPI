A warning on Allen Carr (and any tips?)

I just want to give people out there a quick warning on the Allen Carr method before seeking some advice. This is beyond obvious but when Allen says 'never again' he really does mean 'never again'. I quit for over two and a half years after reading the book and started a slow relapse into full time smoking a few years ago. I can't even really explain why I smoked again, I was just in a situation which triggered a nostalgia for it.  Don't think that the book will work a second time - it doesn't.  It doesnt work the third or fourth time either. 

So what now redditors? Does anyone have any advice here? I have just thrown a pack of cigarettes away for what seems like the 1000th time. How can I not disappoint myself again? I have vowed 'never again' so many times that I can't trust myself any more. Does it have to be the willpower method again? Is that really the only option? Here goes anyway...

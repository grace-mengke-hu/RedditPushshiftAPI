Day 21.. no cravings anymore.. thanks to the training routine :-D

When I stopped smoking, I needed to make sure that I did it properly..  I am using fitness as my new addiction and I do not think thats a bad addiction to have.. Every day, the first thing I do is run up and down a flight of stairs 50 times to open my lungs.  Each day I add a new exercise to the routine.. feeling amazing :-D

I however  cannot go a single day without my stairs.  Psychologically I almost feel I have brainwashed  myself to believe  that  the stairs are the replacement  that is essential  in order for me to stay smoke free.   So even during a storm the other day, I was outside in my raincoat running up and down my stairs... 
For me this has really worked.. my breathing has improved. .  I Feel good..  and I am getting really fit again. 
Win win so far

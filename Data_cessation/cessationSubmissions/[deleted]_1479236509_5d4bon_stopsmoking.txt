checking in 4th day!

I quit saturday, I am not experiencing any major withdrawals because I guess I smoked very less the last week maybe 60 70 % less than what i did usual. And I lifted weights on sunday so the sore muscles are a damn pain and much of my attention is on that pain itself. Also visited the dentist on saturday, got my teeth cleaned and some cavity filling, Smoking does some enormous damage to dental health i guess. Really want to quit this time. Thanks guys!

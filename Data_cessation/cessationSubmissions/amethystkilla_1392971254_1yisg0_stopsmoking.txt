I'm doing it.

Hi! 

I've been a long time lurker. I'm a little over two years clean and sober and would justify my smoking with "well I've given up drugs, gotta get my kicks somewhere" and "everyone in the meetings seems to smoke, it's like a social event" and "I can't imagine my life without cigarettes"...

All of that is bullshit. It's just another addiction. I'm tired of not being able to run a block without wheezing. I'm tired of putting cigs on my budget before groceries. I'm tired of the smell in my car. Just tired of being enslaved and caught up. I'm ready to quit. 

I've been back and forth on the idea for a while, but I found out I am pregnant and saw the little heartbeat today on the ultrasound. It's not just about me and my health anymore. I'm quitting. 

Just wanted to say hi and thank you all for the supportive community you've fostered here :)

I hereby declare that I am quitting smoking for good.

Well, this is it. Just five minutes ago I finished my last cigarette.

I've been smoking for about 4 years at this point, and I've had enough. I genuinely want and need to finally quit.

I have always loved smoking. I enjoy flicking my lighter open and taking that first drag, I love smoking with Freinds, and I love that sinful buzz of nicotine that just makes the troubles of the day seem to go away, even for a few minutes. 

One thing I also enjoyed was chewing tobacco, I chewed tobacco for maybe 2 years, before finally quitting cold turkey on account of fear regarding by dental health, and I haven't had a dip in over 7 months, and I'm super proud of myself that I'm able to say that. Yes, I do get that occasional craving when I see a can, or get a whiff of wintergreen from someone else's can, but I am fully confident that I will never put tobacco behind my lip again. It's not worth it. 

I just need to carry that same attitude when it comes to smoking. As much as I love tobacco and Nicotine, I'm not putting my health at risk, and I'm not making anymore excuses. We all know them....  "I'm sure there's no harm in lighting up one more time." or, "this is my last pack!" Or my favorite, "they're american spirits, they're not that bad for you."


Bullshit

Anyway, I'm done. I'm over it. I can tell this time it's different. I will not allow a stupid addiction to these little white & orange sticks to become more powerful than my will. I hereby declare that I am quitting smoking for good.

And as for everyone else on r/Stopsmoking who is quitting, DO IT! You're not the only ones out there,  if millions of people have the ability to quit than so do I, and so do you.

Peace

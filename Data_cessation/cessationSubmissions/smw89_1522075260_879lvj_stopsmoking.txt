Ladies that have quit for over a month, I have a question for you!

Men are probably opening this still. It's about periods, guys, so there's your warning. Lol

I was just curious how many (if any) of you had an abnormal period after your first month of quitting. My periods are generally pretty irregular, with the only thing staying the same being the heavy amount I bleed and the awful cramps. The period I just finished off was really light, hardly any cramps. It was over two days before it normally would be. 

2 months+ ladies: Did it ever go back to normal if it changed for you? Is it better, worse?

I'm just curious about people's experiences. I'm not asking for medical advice or anything.

Stay strong ladies (and guys that read through this post anyways)!!!

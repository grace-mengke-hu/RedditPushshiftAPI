Day 10 - Way too many mood swings

Not sure if it's related to the lack of nicotine, but overall I feel good; however, the past 2 days I've had very severe bad mood swings, to a point where I get pissed off or sad for no reason; and I start blaming everything and see everything from a negative light.

Well, not sure if the lack of nicotine is related anyway, I've had my grumpy days before even whilst smoking so not sure what's what.

Anyway, **Day 10 not smoking**! This is what I'm looking forward to now: 1 months

> **10 days** - The "average" ex-user is down to encountering less than two crave episodes per day, each less than 3 minutes.

> **10 days to 2 weeks** - Recovery has likely progressed to the point where your addiction is no longer doing the talking. Blood circulation in your gums and teeth are now similar to that of a non-user.

> **2 to 4 weeks** - Cessation related anger, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, impatience, insomnia, restlessness and depression have ended. If still experiencing any of these symptoms get seen and evaluated by your physician.

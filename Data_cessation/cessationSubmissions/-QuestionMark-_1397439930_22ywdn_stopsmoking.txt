God I love that smell...

I'm done smoking, I'm all set with it, but man oh man do I miss the smell.  Odd really since I quit thanks to eCigs and smoking a real cigarette towards the end of that transition was pretty gross for me.  (for the record, I'm off everything now, no nicotine or ecigs at all).

Anyway, I still make it a point to take a strong whiff when people are smoking around me.  I really miss the smell.  At this point it's more of a happy memory then a trigger, I don't want that addiction again, but that odor of someone smoking is still a little slice of heaven.

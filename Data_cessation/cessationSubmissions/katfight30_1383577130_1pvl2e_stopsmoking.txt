Question about different patches to quit smoking?

After deciding to quit smoking (I've smoked about a pack a day for almost 10 years) and reading a lot of posts on this sub I purchased Allen Carr's book for my Kindle and am planning to also get the patch.  My question is regarding name brand (Nicoderm CQ e.g.) or a generic brand?  The price difference is about $15/box but I don't want to throw any money away if the generic doesn't work as well.  Can anyone provide any suggestions based on their experiences?

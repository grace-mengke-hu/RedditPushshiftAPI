7 days YES!

Was never a big believer in support system bullshit, but ... I love you guys! My second serious stint after a 2 year snooze on smoking (thought I was done, so it's been pretty difficult to quit again)

There's always a fine line between fuck it and keep truckin, and it's usually pretty hard to define. But with /stopsmoking it's been way easier to reflect before falling again.

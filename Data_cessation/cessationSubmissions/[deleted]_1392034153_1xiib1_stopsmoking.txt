When Will This Stop?

I kicked what's considered a "harder" drug years ago and the first week or two was pretty bad as the chemical cycled out of my system, but after that it seemed to more or less be okay.  I still wanted to *do* the drug at times(still do), but it wasn't this awful, horrible, soul-crushing ache.  It's been eight weeks and I still have periods of hours where I'm intensely moody, periods of horrific craving(that last longer than 2-5 minutes, I've counted) when I can taste and smell and *feel* the cigarette between my fingers, I cycle back and forth between irritable and wanting to curl up in a ball and cry, and the whole time part of me knows that this could all stop, right now, all I have to do is walk down to the gas station.

I've read the scientific stuff and I've gone through withdrawal before but I thought it was supposed to start easing up after a month or so.  Why do I feel like it's getting *worse*?

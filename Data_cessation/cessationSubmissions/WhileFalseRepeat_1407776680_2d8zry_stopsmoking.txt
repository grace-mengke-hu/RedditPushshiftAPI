Fuckety Fuck

Today I am having some really bad cravings due to depression. 

I keep thinking of a recently failed relationship. There was a glimmer of hope that we might get back together, but some recent communications make it seem extremely unlikely. It is sinking in that I have probably lost someone that I loved (and still love). This person has been a huge part of my life for over 10 years and I can't imagine a life without her.

This depression I am having today also makes me extremely negative and I keep envisaging the worst case scenarios for my future (beyond just relationships). There is a distinct feeling of hopelessness and I feel like everything in my life is turning to shit (and will always be shit). 

I'm really fighting the urge to just say "fuck it" and give in to my raging animal desire to have a cigarette. 

Sorry to be a downer, I was feeling so strong yesterday and now....well....sigh.

I'm going for a run and some exercise. I hope that helps.

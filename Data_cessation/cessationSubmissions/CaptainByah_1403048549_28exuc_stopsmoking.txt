Either you quit smoking or I quit you.

That's what my girlfriend told me. I've been trying to quit but holy douchcanoe
is it tough. Everybody I work with smokes so that doesn't make it any easier. 
Today she asked if I did, I lied and then came clean. I smoked one at lunch. She got mad and stormed off.  So fellow hopeful quitters I need your help, what tips or tricks did you use to quit? She's too important to lose over something stupid like smoking.

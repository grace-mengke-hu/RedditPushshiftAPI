Started smoking when I was 15 and I'm 25 now(holy shit I've been smoking for ten years). I really need to stop. I feel it all the time. Headaches, nausea, aggravation. Anyone have tips for a long time smoker? I've tried to quit a bunch. Longest I've made it is 7 months and I crashed and burned. Help please.

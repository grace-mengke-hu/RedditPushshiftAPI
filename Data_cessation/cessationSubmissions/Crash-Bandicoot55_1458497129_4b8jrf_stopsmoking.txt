How much damage would one year of smoking do to you?

I had my first cigarette a couple months after turning 20 and last shortly after turning 21.  I smoked a maximum of 0.43 pack years.  I was going through deep depression at that time in my life and real had to fight to keep going.  I needed something a little self destructive but luckily it was a phase.  I haven't smoked in four years and will never as long as I'm alive.

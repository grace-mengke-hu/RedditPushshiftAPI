New here, surgery tomorrow (triggers)

So I'm getting surgery on Tuesday.  Crap, tomorrow.  I'm kind of all wound up.  I really quit, but for one or two a day, on the first.  In on Champix (Chantix in the US).  I've been smoke free, with a chain smoking husband, for 5 days now.

*Warning, gross girl stuff:*
I have boob issues.  LCIS, lots of scaring from lumpectomies, fibro-cystic, and huge horrible, constant pain.  My sweater squirrels bite.  So, I'm getting most of the tissue removed (technically just a reduction, but it'll take out a few of the issues.). Add that to in-evenness and the fact that I look like a natural Dolly Parton (no disrespect) I have about 4-6 lbs to lose. The surgeon said he could only do the procedure the way that it really needs to be done if I quit smoking, or I can lose the nipples.  Eeeew.  Not gonna happen!  Apparently those little blood vessels won't heal tight without enough flow, and for me, that meant quitting.  

So here I am.  I'm pretty much done this fit, I think I got through it.  Thank you for the outlet.

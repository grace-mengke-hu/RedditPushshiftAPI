... then you start living your life again

It's been 100 days since I had my last cigarette. The past month or so I haven't really been very active around here, so I thought it was time to check back in. Still have the "Smoke Free" app on my phone, so I knew this day would come soon. And here it is! I want all of you to one day be able to feel what I'm feeling right now. And if I can help ONE person to achieve that by sharing my progress, it's worth it to me.

Most days I don't think about cigarettes, smoking, or nicotine AT ALL. I never have a craving. NEVER. Do you want to know why? I'll tell you why: 100 days ago I finally realized that I didn't want or need nicotine in my life. It served no purpose in my life, and never had - it was all an illusion. I was ignorant and brainwashed. Around ten months prior to that I made a decision for myself - that I was going to quit smoking in 2015. I didn't set a date, and I didn't just decide to quit one day. Instead I treated it as project. I read books and articles, I learned by doing (attempting to quit and failing), and then finally it clicked. All of the pieces came together, and I finally GOT IT. I was ready to leave the nicotine behind.

All those years it was all in my head, while it was gradually also taking over my body, making me more and more addicted by becoming a huge part of my existence. The physical addiction is one thing, you'll realize that's a small part of it once you start educating yourself. The mental addiction though? That's the scary part, the one that takes work to get rid of. As nicotine grows in importance and dominance it's so hard to imagine life without it isn't it? Human beings don't go around remembering how they felt even a year ago unless they went through something traumatic, so no one really remember what it's like to be a non-smoker if they've been smoking for a while. Smoking becomes important to you - and this is your brain tricking you - because you think about it ALL THE TIME. It's at the forefront of your mind at all times, and that's hard to ignore. So, when you are quitting nicotine - your brain basically needs a bit of re-wiring. You need to allow other things to occupy the space that "I want nicotine and I want it now" occupied for all those years. 

So, I can't stress the importance of investing time and energy into the process of quitting smoking enough. When I see, hear, or read about someone who has been smoke free for several years and still has cravings... it makes me so sad. That person still believes he or she gave something up that day, and still believes they are being heroic by having enough willpower to stay away. There's nothing heroic about being miserable for the rest of your life. I feel for those people, I really do. And if you're one of them? Education is not only for those who are starting to quit, it's never to late to face reality. 

So, whatever stage you are in on the path to a life without nicotine; If you are finding it difficult it's important to understand WHY. Ask yourself that, and seek the answers through information from people who have been where you are, from within, or from science. Don't just listen to one person, get the whole story and find what resonates with you. There's a reason somewhere, something you can work on. 

I didn't use any form of substitute, nicotine filled or otherwise (food). I simply quit doing the thing that wasn't serving any other purpose than killing me (slowly). Substituting would only imply that there was a void - there was no void. Surely there are several things that I've started doing now that I no longer smoke, but those come from the benefits that comes with smoking - more time and energy. Your life changes because you're no longer spending all your time facilitating your addiction.


Here's a list of some benefits I'm currently enjoying as a non-smoker, for those of you who might need some motivation. These didn't occur at day 100, but have come gradually since I quit. 

The physical:

 - I'm breathing. Like actually breathing, deep breaths. The greatest improvement is seen when exercising, along with the lowered heart rate. Been exercising outdoors in the cold weather lately, where my lungs are REALLY doing what they were designed to do. And I don't get that pain between my shoulder blades afterwards (that comes from shallow breathing).

 - I haven't had a headache in over 3 months. I didn't get them often, maybe once every other week, and I thought it was due to me being stressed or tired. Yeah, tired of smoking.

 - I have SO much more energy. I'm not dragging myself home from work, lethargic and worn out. I go home, and then I do something productive with the rest of my day. I can go cross-country skiing for 3 hours and still have energy left. When I smoked I basically collapsed on the couch as soon as I got home. 

 - No more cramps during that time of the month (and other benefits due to improved circulation that I'll spare you any more details on (TMI)). For the last 15 years (or more) this was a major struggle in my life, to the point I was spending so much time dreading its arrival every month, and trying to plan my life to facilitate it. It's hard to describe how freeing this particular point is, but maybe some of you ladies out there get it. It's been a very important one for me, one that I wasn't expecting at all.  

The psychological:

 - I'm more present in my life. More aware, more focused. I find myself interested in things again. Hobbies, music, things happening around me. It's like I've gone from existing to living. 

 - I'm in a much better mood, and it's been noticed by those around me (who don't really know why, so the speculations are awesome to witness). 

 - I might experience stress from time to time, but it's EASIER to deal with. Overall I'm less stressed (by far).

 - I can be completely calm and relaxed. This was one of the things I longed for, and let me tell you: It's amazing - you should try it. 

 - Procrastination be gone. I get stuff done! Even my plants look alive!

So what would you rather do?

1. Be miserable for the rest of your (short) life? 
or
2. Sacrifice a bit of time now to ensure you have a happier (and longer) life?

Stop punishing yourself, and pick number 2.
Telling yourself it's hard doesn't make it any easier.

Question - Can I wear a nicotine patch during the weekdays and continue smoking during the weekends?

I am currently undergoing treatment for a rough depression and am leaving most of my self-harming vices behind, the least unhealthy of them all being smoking. I am not ready to quit smoking completely though and need to know if I can safely use a nicotine patch during the weekdays to help with the cravings and then smoke a bit during the weekends.

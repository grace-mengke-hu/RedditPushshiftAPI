When you're trying to quit do you have the feeling that you know you're going to just smoke eventually?

How do you get rid of this feeling? I've had a couple bad cravings, I've overcome them so far. But in the back of my mind, I'm like, damnit, I know I'm going to break. Is this just a matter of having a weak mind? No willpower? No confidence?

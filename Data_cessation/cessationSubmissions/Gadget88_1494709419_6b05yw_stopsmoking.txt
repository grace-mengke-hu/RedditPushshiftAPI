3 weeks today after 10 years!

I never thought I would get to this point and I wanted to say thanks to this community for the support. Just waking up in the morning and reading some posts was an amazing reinforcement. 

Today, I was coming back from the grocery store in the pouring rain and saw a guy outside my apartment building smoking in the downpour. I laughed to myself thinking about how proud I am that I wasn't out there with him trying to keep my cigarette dry! Instead of using a rainy day off to sneak extra smoking time while my partner is working, I'm celebrating 21 days with slow cooker ribs. Cheers to you guys and this awesome journey we've decided to take, I'll be thinking of you all when I can actually TASTE this homemade BBQ sauce!!

Looking for an app to cut down and quit

Hi everyone,

I've got a friend who wants to cut down from a half pack/pack a day, by maybe a cig or two a week until he's down low enough to quit. Is there an app that works well for this? He's tried cold turkey on the smokes and can't make it stick, but he's had great results using MyFitnessPal for weight loss. Thanks much for any help!

Chest pain

Does anyone had/have chest pain when they smoke? I mean i am worried about cancer or something. Is it possible that its just early worning and body's fight against smoke but not a cancer? I will see doctor 25 of july, but i worry so much, if i stop smoking for a day, chest pain is gone and today i decide to quit for good. Please can someone give me a hope that i didnt fucked up my life?

I work at a Gas station.

Quitting smoking for me tends to be a bit more infuriating than most because 40-50 hours a week I am surrounded by cigs. Does anyone have any advice or help with this. I am 26 and have been smoking since I was 18. Last time I went cold turkey I became such a mean person that everyone urged me to smoke (I know its not the right thing to do) but I know I was awful and don't want that to happen again. Did 1800 quit now and did patches and as soon as I was off the patch I was right back.

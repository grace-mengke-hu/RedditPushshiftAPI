triumph of the bar

Just wanted to share really quickly how amazing this sub is. I lurk this sub almost everyday, and I really can't thank you all enough for posting here. I went out to a bar tonight with a friend because she wanted to see some bands play. I was nervous since I hadn't really been to a bar since I quit, but it was fine. I read this sub a lot beforehand to prepare myself. Instead of dwelling on cigarettes, I danced and enjoyed the music. Later on, someone even put a cigarette in my face, asking if I wanted a drag. I smiled and said no. I feel so great. I never thought I could say no to cigarettes. When I was smoking, I couldn't watch another person smoke without smoking myself and would use it as an excuse to chain smoke. 

I thank this sub - YOU GUYS ARE GREAT.

"I don't smoke" and how that phrase helped me quit!

I threw out my last pack of cigarettes a week ago. I smoked 3-4 cigarettes a day on and a off for 4 years. And, at 20 years old, was wheezing after running 3 miles.

I tossed my cigarettes in the trash and when people ask me for one or if I smoke (bartender, so drunk people and coworkers ask a lot) I just "I don't smoke" or "I'm not a smoker". That phrase makes me feel so powerful and when I have a craving I just say it. Out loud. And it feels so good! Like, yeah! Fuck those cigarettes. 

Thanks for reading--I just wanted to share this magic phrase I've discovered!

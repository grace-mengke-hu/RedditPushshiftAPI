I don't know how to be a person without cigarettes.

(Ignore my badge. I haven't been here since my last attempt at quitting, a year and a half ago. I reset it, but the bots are not as speedy as I am in posting.)

I am 33. I have smoked, full on, since I was 15. I don't know how to be a person without cigarettes.

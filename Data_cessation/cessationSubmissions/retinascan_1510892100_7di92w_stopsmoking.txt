I went all Forrest Gump yesterday

I’m about 48 days in on my quit. After the blackhawks game yesterday, filled with a fair amount of beer, I was walking to my friends place. It was cold, and quite a distance. I also felt like smoking. So I just decided to start running to get there sooner. Surprisingly, I was able to run for a fair amount of time before I got tired. I was astounded by it. Amazing that I couldn’t run at all before and just stopping smoking had given me back some stamina! It’s awesome!

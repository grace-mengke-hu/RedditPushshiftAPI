Here we go again again

It's funny how a slip just slips into days of self justification. But I'm doing it again, not going to quit quitting. I'll have contract work with a lot of non smokers to keep me busy and hopefully get two days easily under my belt, and hopefully a quiet weekend will let me stave off the urges to buy more.

Quitting Cigarettes and Alcohol as of Sunday.

[CROSSPOST TO R/STOPDRINKING](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/6o5gei/quitting_cigarettes_and_alcohol_as_of_sunday/)

I've been drinking 5 to 8 beers, every night, for about 18 months. *(Which has actually been tapered down from jars of whiskey and moonshine just over a year ago)*  Sure, I've skipped a day here in there but you know.  I am an alcoholic and every male in my family has struggled with it.  Before my daily drinking began I was still the kind of guy that would not hesitate to turn them back from time to time.  I've always been keen on keeping my genetic predisposition to alcoholism in check but as I've inched into my 30's I have been neglectful.  Furthermore, I smoke a pack a day of Pall Mall menthol for going on ten years. 

My wife is going out of town for a full week with her sister, father, and father's wife.  I am going to quit both drinking and smoking as soon as they leave for the beach.  I'm quitting cold turkey, am aware of the side effects and on top of all of that, I am an epileptic. I will be posting my updates here beginning Sunday. 


*  My motives rest in being a better husband and father, preservation of my health, and saving unnecessary expenses.

* So the plan is **NO CIGARETTES** and **NO ALCOHOL** as of Sunday morning when I wake up.

* As to why I'm waiting till Sunday:  I get it.  *"Why not go ahead and quit now"?*  It's just how I decided to do it.  I feel like when my normal routine changes, as my family goes out of state for a week, this presents a good opportunity for me to change my substance use routine simultaneously. 

*   If I fuck up, and I don't intend to, I'll tell the truth here in this thread.  If I am pissed and irrational and feel the need to vent, I will post it here in this thread.  I'm gonna try to use this thread as a support group.  Maybe we will get to know each other over the next week. See ya'll later. 

**Timeline of Updates**

* **Friday 2:35 p.m.** 
I'm not going to drink more than three beers tonight and three beers tomorrow night & keep my cigarettes to a minimum as well.  I'm actually kind of nervous and anxious at the thought of this but I know that is part of it.

* **Saturday 11:11 a.m.**
I drank more than 3 beers last night.  Shamefully, I drank around 8.  I'm not beating myself up too badly because it's not Sunday yet, so technically my plan hasn't started yet.  I will practice more self control.

* **Saturday 2:03 p.m.**
I've got 7 cigarettes left in my pack and 1 tall boy in the fridge.  That's going to be it for today and then tomorrow is a new beginning.

[u/rahtin](https://www.reddit.com/user/rahtin) has brought up the possibility of dying from my decision.  I mean, I don't want to die, obviously, so what's the deal with that?  Outside of falling and hitting my head, is there a real risk of just straight up dying from withdrawal symptoms?  I don't need that kind of fear right now.


* **Sunday 7:09 a.m.**
Here we go!  I've got the house to myself.  It's calm and quite.  Have not smoked today so far and there is no beer in the house. There is still a bag of tobacco and some roll-your-own tubes on the fridge.  Not sure if I should keep it or throw it away.

* **Sunday 7:25 a.m.**
I just vomited up my breakfast.  I really wasn't expecting to begin feeling sick so soon.  Oh well, I feel better now.  Gonna go play some Crossout.

* **Sunday 9:52 a.m** Still no cigarette.  Obviously the alcohol withdrawal hasn't kicked in yet but I know that bastard is just around the corner.

* **Sunday 3:41 p.m.** Still on track.  Have not smoked all day and if you count when I was sleeping, we're approaching the 24 hour mark soon.  Noticing intensified cravings.  Went to the BBQ place down the road and got a big ass burger.

* **Monday 8:51 p.m.**  Made it to the 24 hour mark and then went and bought a six pack.  Damn it!  With my family being out of town, it was even harder to just sit at the house with no beer or smokes last night.  I only drank 4 out of the six pack and smoked 4 cigarettes between 8:00-10:30.  I'm still going to keep trying, though admittedly a new approach is needed.  Since 4 was the amount I had last night it will be my limit and since I didn't touch anything until after 8.  This rule will also stand.  
**NEW PLAN**
* No more than 4 beers & 4 cigarettes and only after 8:00 p.m.
* This limit can only go down and never back up.

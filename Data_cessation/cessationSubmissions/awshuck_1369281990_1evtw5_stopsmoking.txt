18 months, caved in a bit but have not bought a single pack.

Smoked for almost 5 years, 3/4 pack a day average. Pack a day for a year. Suffered with trying to quit for 6 months - constantly relapsing, then finally stopped completely. That was 18 months ago. 

I wont lie, twice during this 18 month period I've caved into having a single cigarette after a few beers. But I feel that's inconsequential as It hasn't led anywhere - except guilt. I really did not enjoy going back to that taste or smell after such a long period of time. 

To help you guys, here's some of the things that helped me.

* I switched to Roll-your-own before quitting (primarily due to cost), I found them far less addictive. I could still get my hit, but the pain of having to roll them got a bit hard.

* You really really have to want to do this, ambivalence=failure. 

* In the final days of completely quitting, if I was going out with smoker friends, I'd have a cigar instead and sit on it all night. I don't enjoy those as much but it helped a lot. Although I got mocked a little. 

I understand this isn't for everyone. Maybe it was all psychological. But these things might still be worth a try. Good luck!

3 days in - here I am again

I had my last cigarette just before noon EST on Saturday.  I have tried to quit a few times and seem to keep relapsing, although every time I have, I have taken notes on what was the reason (trigger) and am trying to avoid them and find another way to deal with them.  This is suppose to be the worst day and usually don't make it past this day as my mind tells me one more pack and I will feel better, which I never do in reality, but my mind tries to convince me that I am better off with them than without them.  I know this is not true and I have it written on a post it note that is attached to my monitor as I am working on a website today and it keeps reminding me that I am better off without them than with them, despite what my mind might try to tell me.

Sorry if I seem to be rambling.  My mind is not quite what it used to be.  All over the place.  Hopefully this will go away with time and I can focus better as I did before.

Day 3!

Hi guys! I'm new around here.  I've been searching for stop smoking communities and stumbled upon this one. I'm about to be 72 hours clean at about 11:30am CST. So proud of myself.  I'm doing this all cold turkey because NRTS did not help me in the past.  NTAP (never take another puff) I will not smoke with you today!  ^^

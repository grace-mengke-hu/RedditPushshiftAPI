Changed my Internet Dating Profile and was very surprised

I have a profile on Plenty of Fish, don't really use it much but I was getting about 3 or 4 women a month click the I would like to meet you button. About 3 days ago I changed my profile from smokes to does not smoke and I have had about 4 or 5 women a day clicking they would like to meet me. Quite surprised about the numbers.

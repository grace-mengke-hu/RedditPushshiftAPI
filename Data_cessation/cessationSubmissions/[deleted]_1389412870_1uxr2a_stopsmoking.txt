A problem I have every time I attempt to quit smoking. Any advice is appreciated.

---First, I have been diagnosed with ADHD and Social Anxiety Disorder (although, my therapist at school said that he thinks that it is just ADHD and occasional signs of General Anxiety Disorder).  I'm mentioning this because it seems like these things may exacerbate the symptoms from smoking cessation; not because I want to use it as an excuse to delay my cessation, but rather to see if anyone has a perspective that takes this information into account.

---SO...  Every time I try to quit I have this weird feeling of "lightness" or "emptiness"...  This may be what people refer to as "restlessness", but I'm not sure its exactly the same.
 
---For example, sometimes I will feel restless, but I can go exercise and it will go away.  However, when I have this "empty or light" feeling, I feel like I need *something*; be it candy, cigarettes, or a soda.

---I'm terrible at understanding describing my "bodily feelings" (my doctor actually gets pretty frustrated when I can't tell if my ADD meds are helping me...  I literally can't tell)...  So if anyone has any advice on how to "overcome" this feeling, then it would be appreciated.  Moreover, I'd like to know if this is a feeling that results from nicotine addiction itself; not that it would change my desire to stop smoking, but it would be optimistic (no lying just to give me a false sense of optimism though!..  If this isn't the case, then I want to find the feeling's true source, and deal with it).   
--- Thanks for reading.

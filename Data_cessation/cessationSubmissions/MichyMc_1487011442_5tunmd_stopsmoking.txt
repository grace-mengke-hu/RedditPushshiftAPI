1,000 hours down! Some things I forgot existed until I quit smoking.

Smells. You guys remember smells? The world smells really good. Before I quit the most I'd smell outside were some intense garden smells or the smell of the bad sewage system in my neighbourhood. Now I can smell all kinds of little things.

Everything also feels better. It's kind of ridiculous and I don't know if it's like a placebo thing but everything feels much, much better. Like the last week of school before summer vacation good or playing Zelda for the first time good. It's hard to put my finger on but the air feels nice on my skin, I want to go hang out in the sun, music sounds so nice. There's all these little things that I forgot about that have just come back.

Which is all good because quitting was fucking *hard*. In ways I didn't expect either. I thought I'd have niggly cravings for a few weeks not hardcore depression, spikes in anxiety, insomnia, flu symptoms, all of that on top of niggly cravings. Yikes.

13 Days and hoping for some inspiration

Hey r/stopsmoking! I've been lurking here for a few months. Last Tuesday I decided to take the plunge, cold turkey, after a four day wean off the cigs. The first few days were damn hard to get through. I've been a pack a day smoker for 10 years, with 4 previous quit attempts. All but one attempt resulted in relapse around the 21 day milestone. I'm approaching that milestone again in a week and I'm becoming fearful. The cravings are ramping up in frequency and intensity. I use mints in place of cigarettes (it helps to remind myself fresh breath is nicer than smoker breath) and the time it takes to suck a mint away is enough to pass the craving. How do you push through your tough spots?

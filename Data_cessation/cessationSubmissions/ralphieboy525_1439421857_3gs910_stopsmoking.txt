First new day!

Today is my first day smoke free. I made the decision after a couple of weeks of contemplation. Last night, I had my last smoke, crushed the rest and chucked them.

This morning got up early, hit the gym, and worked off the workout high to keep me from buying a pack. Hung out with a couple of coworkers a couple of hours into work while they smoked out on the dock, no cravings or urges. Around lunch time, that when it kicked into overdrive. I would text my sister about how much I just wanted to have one to take the edge off. She calmed me down a bit.

Its about 1625 here at work, and I'm going strong. The only thing that kills me is having a few minutes between projects and wanting to reward myself with a smoke. There was nothing better than getting through a painful project and lighting up.

Right now, I'm trying to keep a journal (I have one for my dieting/work out progress. Good place to incorporate my cravings/feelings) and its given me the opportunity to think through the cravings. I'm still thinking of ways to change my daily routine to avoid my triggers. 

This is my usual routine as of now. Anyone have any quick advice they could share if anything looked familiar? Thank you all!

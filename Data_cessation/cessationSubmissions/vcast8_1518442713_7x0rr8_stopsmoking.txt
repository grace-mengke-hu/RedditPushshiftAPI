about to start my first full day



im 24 and started smoking two years ago when i started my first full time job and playing music shows. it’s been a habit i’ve been pretending to be casual about but i have slowly witnessed it take over my life. without even thinking about it i’ve let it control the way i spend my time alone and around people.... every once in a while i get a bad sore throat and cough which i used to think was just casual but i now realize can lead to really bad infections... so i’m over it. not worth this discomfort. 

so i’ve decided to stop and today is my first full day i’m gonna go without it. i’ve decided to just try to get through one day without it just so it feels less intimidating than imagining myself stopping cold turkey forever (please let me know if you think this is harmful thinking). i’m pretty nervous about it to be quite honest. i don’t want to be irritable at work. but i also want this sore throat to go away. and the smell!! i’m so sick of smelling this bad. 

i don’t really post on forums or anything like that, but i feel like in these situations i need to feel the least alone as possible. even if it’s with strangers...

so if any of y’all have tips for how to cope with the first day? snacks you’ve found helpful? music that calmed you? inspiration quotes? not entirely sure what i’m looking for. and how stupid would it be if i started vaping? is that not going to help the cause?

How do I handle sleeplessness?

I plan on quitting smoking- in April 14th is my quit date!! The biggest problem I've had in the past is my inability to get to sleep. I do alright if I am busy, but it is kind of difficult to stay busy when you're forced to relax. How do you guys handle pre-bed cravings?

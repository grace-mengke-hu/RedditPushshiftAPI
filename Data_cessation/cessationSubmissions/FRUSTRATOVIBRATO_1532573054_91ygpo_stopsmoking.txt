There is a famous study that shows that if you quit smoking by age 30, scientists can't show a statistically significant difference in mortality

[I saw this article today, and filled me with elation.](https://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1819144,00.html) Had been subscribed to this subreddit for a while but had no real intentions of quitting then I quit 12 days ago having just woken up one morning and decided I was done after 14 years of smoking (I'm now 28.) Interesting side note: I live in China and smoking is tied to social events, every restaurant or bar people will force their status symbol cigarettes on you. I'd always thought that'd make quitting impossible here, but it has been surprisingly easy! Even when I've drank, I haven't found it a challenge to say no. 

  
With regards to coping with cravings, bought really nice coffee for my work and each time I would routinely go for a smoke, taking a cup of black coffee instead. Then if i feel agitated I just tell myself it is caffeine jitters.  


Keep it up everybody and thanks to the long-term non-smokers for the encouragement they give to everyone.

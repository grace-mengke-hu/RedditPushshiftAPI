Smoke free for almost 72 full and entire hours...and its getting easier! :-)

So I smoked my last cig at 4:00 pm Saturday, and here I am, 12:30pm on Monday cig free. The sweating and anxiety have definitely been present and *very* up-front, but I am doing this for good and I'm doing it cold turkey god damnit. My girlfriend(non-smoker) has wanted me to quit for 2 years and I finally had am inner monologue with myself and said "HEY! Time to knock this shit off and take care of yourself!" So I don't have much of a closing for this, guess I just needed somewhere to vent my inner thoughts and feelings. Thanks for existing, r/stopsmoking!

Edit: UPDATE: Almost 4 full days cig free, and the cravings are gone completely!

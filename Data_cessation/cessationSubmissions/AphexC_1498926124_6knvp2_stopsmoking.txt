It's officially been a year since I've stopped smoking!

Honestly, this sub helped me so much to achieve this. Going cold turkey is no joke, but with your support and tips, I'm super happy to say that I'm a non-smoker.

Quick shoutout to Alan Carr and his wonderful books.

I'm gonna celebrate with a pizza.

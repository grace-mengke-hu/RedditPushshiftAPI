21 days smoke-free!

So I posted here 3 weeks ago saying how nervous I was about quitting cold turkey. I haven’t smoked a cigarette since. For those who JUST quit or are thinking about it, I just wanted to share that I’ve come out through the other side and it does feel so much better. I can breathe easier, my stomach is already way less sensitive to the food I eat, and I no longer worry about whether or not I am stinking up my environment. 

Not going to lie, the first week was rough. I had smokers flu, and on my 4th day off cigarettes I did feel trapped in my own body. I was coughing and sneezing non stop, and felt so restless. What helped was having my friend by my side telling me that everything was going to be ok. In the middle of a panic attack we decided it would be smart to go outside, so we took a walk to the park where I ran a few sprints on the basket ball court. I’m no athlete at all but doing something that simple helped relieve the awful anxiety and restless my body was feeling. And because I’m no athlete, I was immediately tired and slept soundly that night. 

What also helped is telling all my friends about what I’m going through, and politely asking them to not smoke around me or ask me to smoke. I’m lucky that they’ve been considerate, and it has helped me feel less isolated. 

Also, Alan Carr’s book really did help. It made me realize a lot of things that I thought I knew, but I actually was just repressing. By not smoking I’m not missing out on anything. Every time I don’t smoke when I think I want to, I’m actually helping my body be healthier and more prepared to handle the world. 

I hope my story gives someone out there some peace of mind for a bit. Having this thread really helped me through that first week.

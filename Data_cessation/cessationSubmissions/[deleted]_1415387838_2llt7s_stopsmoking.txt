7 hours into my 3rd "day one".

Was that title confusing enough for you? Today is the third day that I've had to set the clock to "zero". I smoked one cigarette this morning at about 7 a.m., and I knew as I smoked it that it was to be the last one. I was halfway through reading Allen Carr's Easy Way.

I just finished Easy Way about 30 minutes ago, and it has been 7 hours since that last cigarette. I am a non-smoker, and it feels good.

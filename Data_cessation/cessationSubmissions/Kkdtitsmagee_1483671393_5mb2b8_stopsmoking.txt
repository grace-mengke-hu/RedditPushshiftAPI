Aaaargh!!!

I am losing it here. I've smoked for eleven years, stopped when I got pregnant, restarted stupidly after he was born and I was tired and  stressed and am now 5 days cig free. My boyfriend is being a jack ass and I've realized he's my biggest trigger. It is taking everything in me to not sneak to the store and get a black and mild, which is not a cigarette so I can say it doesn't count ðŸ˜© Helpful words please !

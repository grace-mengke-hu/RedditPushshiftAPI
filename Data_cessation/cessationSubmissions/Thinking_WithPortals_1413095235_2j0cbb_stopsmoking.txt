Day 0; Need help/advice

Hey there,

I've decided to get the monkey off my back once and for all, and I want to try and quit cold turkey.

My biggest fear is being around my colleagues, who all smoke, and we are always working outdoors. Do you guys have any advice for helping with this situation, because the last thing I want to do is cave in and fail at the first hurdle.

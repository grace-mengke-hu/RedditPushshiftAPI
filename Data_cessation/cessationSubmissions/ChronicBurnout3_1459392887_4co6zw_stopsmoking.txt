Ive got it down to a pack per week, but...

Im smoking an avg of 3 per day with occasional non smoking day and sometimes a day of 4-5, but Ive learned cigs really make me feel like shit after more than a couple. But I cant give em up entirely. 

This is sustainable, while quitting permanently seems very impossible, due to everyone I work with smoking like a chimney. 

Is this really not a "bad" habit or an addiction because I have it under control, and its a very minimal part of my life. It doesnt feel unhealthy. Also we all die anyway, and if Im healthy and happy (I exercise 1.5 hours per day), cant I just live a little?At least until my work situation changes? Or torture myself daily with cold turkey?

Help.

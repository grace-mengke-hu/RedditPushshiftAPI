It's the little victories that help me along.

53 days smoke free! I am enrolled in college taking prerequisites for an LVN program( this is my 3rd year it doesn't normally take that long, just the way it worked out for me).  I had never carried a backpack as a smoker because they hold smell and I knew I would stink up the class with one. I started my semester last week but before that bought a really nice backpack to carry the heavy ass books and it has made my life easier and it looks really nice too.  Anyway stay strong fellow quitters you can do this and pay attention to the little victories, they have big impacts on our ultimate goals!

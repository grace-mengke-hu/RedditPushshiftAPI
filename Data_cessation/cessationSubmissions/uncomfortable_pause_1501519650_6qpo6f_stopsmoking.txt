Day 18: Thinking About the Future

Hi, I’ve been lurking since I stopped smoking cigarettes 18 days ago using the 7mg patch and 2mg lozenges.  I had smoked about 10 cigs a day for 17 years.  It has been tough but I haven’t cheated.  My driving motivation is vanity!

 
But now that I’m getting through box 2 of patches and looking at the future, I had some questions for everyone.  My thought was to stop the lozenges entirely after the first month, and use only the patch for month 2 then use lozenges alone if necessary after that.  What kind of withdrawal should I expect after stopping the NRT?  Am I being too optimistic about my timeline?

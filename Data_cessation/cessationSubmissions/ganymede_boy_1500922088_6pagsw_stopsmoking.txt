Two Thousand Days

Thanks again to all in this sub (which admittedly I don't frequent nearly as much as I used to). I reshare my post from my 300th day below:

My top tips:

Set a quit date 4 weeks out, and reduce smoking till that date (I halved my smoking each week leading to the quit date).

Tell friends & family.

Have a quit buddy (someone who has quit around the time you will)

First month or 2: keep finger foods around (healthy ones are best) like carrot sticks or pretzel sticks.

For bad cravings, try brushing your teeth or using moutwash.

Pick up a new hobby or expand on one you've been neglecting.

Use an App. "QuitNow" and others are good options.

Lastly - accept that the process is not an easy one, and that it often takes more than one try to get quitting "right". Challenge yourself to be stronger than most by quitting and setting an example for others to follow.

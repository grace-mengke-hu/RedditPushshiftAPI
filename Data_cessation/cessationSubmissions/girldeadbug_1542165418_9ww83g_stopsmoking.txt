Has guilt ever made you stop smoking or did it just make you angry?

I buy my dude cigarettes, while we run out of gas to work and have nothing to eat or drink in the house. I brought this up and all I got was "..." and "whatever". Every time I get my little money from raking leaves or shoveling snow, I tell myself I won't do it, but I'd rather him shut the fuck up about needing a cigarette and fail.

I told him it's the last time and I'm going to stand my ground. He can bitch all he wants. I went and returned bottles for money, while he has a bigger bag than I do but says it's not worth returning.. I guess if you have cigs, eating and drinking just isn't important? I don't fucking know. It's so irritating when an addiction makes you forget about the needs of your loved one(s).

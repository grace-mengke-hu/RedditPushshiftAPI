Day 5 and can't stop crying.

Every little thing makes me want to cry; either out of anger or sadness. I've never had PMS this bad. Hell, I've never been through a breakup this bad. Luckily, I have excellent friends and my bf is a therapist, but I'm really tired of bawling at the drop of a pin and not being able to go out in public for fear I'll have the 20th emotional breakdown of the day. 

Help? Will this end soon?

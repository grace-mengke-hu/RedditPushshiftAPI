To those all out there: rexist!

To those all out there, resist. (EDIT: I got wrong with the title)
This is the only message I want to leave you. It's more than one year and half that I quitted smoking, I am one week from my 20th month without even holding a cigarette in my hand.
I had, I have sometimes now, and I will surely in the future have cravings and moments when I will want a cigarette.
It's perfectly normal, it's a drug and we have been introduced to it. But I know who has now got the control, and I feel great.

Keep it on, and use this to ask everything you want.
I am going to start a new quitting experience, for something else. I can only say that it is very important.

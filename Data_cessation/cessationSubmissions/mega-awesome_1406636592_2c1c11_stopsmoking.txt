6 days... WHAAAATTT :)

I seriously can't believe I made it to 6 days and that I feel as good as I do.  I've been smoking for over half my life and every previous attempt to quit was filled with misery, self doubt, and sneaking smokes behind peoples back.  But I feel good, I'm still having massive cravings, especially in the evening, but I think they get weaker and I get stronger each time.  

Headed on a road trip all next week, I'm taking all the money I've saved, and stopping at the Kate Spade outlet store for something special :)

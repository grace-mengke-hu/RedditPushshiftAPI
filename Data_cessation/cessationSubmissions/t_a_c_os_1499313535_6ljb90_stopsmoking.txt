Just had my last smoke

Just had my last smoke, not sure how I'm feeling. For months I've been saying this will be my last pack but I finally made the decision not to buy another today. I've quit a few times for a couple months even a year at one point and each time I felt like I was ready to quit, but not this time I feel like I'm going to continue on smoking even though I won't, which is messing with my head. I expect to wake up tomorrow and go along with my regular routine that revolves around smoking. I wake up and have a smoke with my cup of coffee, most of my smokes throughout the day I spend strategizing or looking things up. I play alot of Xbox and I multitask, so I'll watch videos at the same time or watch guides than when I come to something I need to pay attention to or figure out and wrap my head around I go outside have a smoke and focus on that one thing so I can get that few minutes alone to do what I need to do. Any tips on how I can go about my routine without drastically changing it would be much appreciated, I'm really dreading tomorrow

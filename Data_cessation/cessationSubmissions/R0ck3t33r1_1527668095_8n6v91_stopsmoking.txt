Quitting tonight. After so many failed attempts i know this time its for good.

I have put this off for far too long. I know it's only bad, i know only good can come from quitting. I'm sick of the grip these horrible things have on me. I'm truly ready to quit. 

I have been reading all of the posts here for a while, I feel inspired whenever I read the success.

Nicotine-free vaping

Hi!

I'm on my 7th day and although I successfully managed to avoid smoking on the weekend, I missed going outside with people for a smoke and the usual chit-chat. 
I don't really carve that much, but most of my friends smoke and I was wondering if nicotine-free vaping is something that won't ruin my fight.

What I worry about is that even though it will have no nicotine, I will somehow get addicted to it and vape even when not at a party. Anyone have an experience with it? How addicting it is? Does it make carvings worse because it reminds you of "real" smoking?

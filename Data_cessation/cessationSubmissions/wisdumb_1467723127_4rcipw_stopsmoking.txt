Smoker for 6 years

I'm done. Was smoking two packs a week and then my hours got cut and my shift got switched to graveyard. Since its security and have nothing to do I've been smoking a pack a day (my entire 8hr shift). I smell worse than I ever had, I'm exhausted all the time, and with smokes at 5.56 a pack I can't afford them anymore working 32hrs a week on 11/hr. I'm just done.

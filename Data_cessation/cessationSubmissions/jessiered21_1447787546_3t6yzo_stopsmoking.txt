About to hit my one year anniversary

I quit on 28 Nov 2014, after finding out I was pregnant. The first 2 weeks were hard but I knew I couldn't feel good about myself if I continued while growing a baby.

After my first baby was born I lasted 2.5 months postpartum then started again (didn't smoke during that pregnancy either).

This time I will NOT cave. It's almost been a year, the longest I've quit for in 15 years of smoking. And, on 31 December this year, I'll have gone a full calendar year without nicotine. I'm so happy.

My favourite differences:
- I can smell everything! (Sometimes bad, haha)
- no cough
- my sense of taste is amazing now
- I don't smell gross to other people
- money in the bank 
- I swear I sleep deeper. No idea why but I'm sure it's from not smoking

Stopped smoking 11 days ago, throat's been really sore today.

So I was really sick 2 weeks ago with a viral infection with a bad cough and sinus and I ended up smoking through half of it when I decided to at the very least stop until I got better. I was taking an antibiotic amoxicillin  (was supposed to take it for 10 days, took it for 8), felt better 4 days after I stopped smoking, continued to not smoke. I stopped taking the antibiotic after 8 days cuz I wanted to drink with my friends cuz I hadn't in several weeks and I had been 100% better for about 3 days. This was a couple of days ago, still haven't smoked and when I woke up today I had a sore throat, wasn't super painful or anything but its been around most of the day. Is that normal? 
EDIT: thank you for your reassurances friends

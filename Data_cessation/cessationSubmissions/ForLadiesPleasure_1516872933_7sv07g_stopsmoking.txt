Does the smoking desire ever fade?

I'm at day 11 and i wanted to ask those who quit for more time than me if the desire ever fades. Obviously the hard part were the first three days, now i don't get the desire to smoke that hard but when i wake up i still want a cigarette, when I'm done eating i still want a cigarette or even through the day... I remember asking a guy who quit for 20 years, he told the desire never fades. Is it true for you?

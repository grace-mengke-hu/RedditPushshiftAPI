Doing it right this time.

So, today starts the first day of third time quitting. The first two times I quit for 10 months and 11 months surrounding both of my pregnancies. The issue I think at this point was, I was doing it for them in my head, I never made the decision really, I just quit because I had to. When they were born, I would eventually start back again. My oldest daughter is now 3 though and she literally imitates everything I do. I am so ashamed to say this now....yesterday I was outside with the girls. They were running around and my daughter ran to the carport, saw where we put our butts, and automatically grabbed one and started to put it in her mouth. As I stopped her, I realized I had to quit. My daughters deserve better and if they are going to follow in my footsteps, I need to make it a better path to follow. Here's to a new direction!

I need some advice with what to do about my boyfriends smoking?

He's 24 and has been smoking for about 3 years. He has been saying he is going to quit for the past year and almost every week he'll quit the ends up starting again about Wednesday for any reason he can find, such as he has an exam, he's on holidays, he's going out tonight etc. Then restarts all over again in the next week or two. So now he's saying he'll quit when he has nothing coming up, which is never obviously. I've been nothing but supporting him but now it's driving me crazy and I've had enough, it's just so frustrating and I don't know what more I can do?

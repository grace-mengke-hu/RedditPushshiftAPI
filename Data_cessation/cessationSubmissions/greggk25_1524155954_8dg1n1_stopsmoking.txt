7 1/2 days.

Just passed the week mark and I think I’m finally hitting my stride. This community has been a huge help and I can’t thank y’all enough for all the comments and for just showing up and sharing your stories. Everything that pops up with my quit seems to be covered by someone somewhere in this group. Knowing I’m not the only one going through this is amazingly comforting. Thanks Everyone!!

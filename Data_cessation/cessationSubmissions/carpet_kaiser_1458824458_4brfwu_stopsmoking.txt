Nicotine withdrawal makes me feel like I'm stoned -- how long will this last?

I feel weird, and warped, and cracked out of my head. 

How long is this going to last? I've read that it takes 4-6 weeks for our brain receptors to return to normal ... but I can't imagine it's going to be like, 2nd day withdrawal bad the entire time. 

Will it? I hope not! 

Thanks. 8-)

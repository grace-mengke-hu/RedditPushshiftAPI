Day 3 has ended

This is my first post here and I just thought I would share.

So i've been on and off cigs for quite some time now, I quit when I enlisted in the army but after basic training, I picked up smoking again and smoked about 4 packs a week. After I finished my service I cut it down from 4 to 1 and now none.

These passed 3 days have been hell for me, my uni film group is full of smokers and when I meet my buddies for coffee they all smoke. 

Reading some of the posts on here have really made me persevere through the cravings, my next challenge will be on day 5 when I go for drinks with some of my former army buddies.

Tips for getting over fatigue?

Hey all.  Couple days in and the fatigue is unbearable, I can't seem to get enough coffee and I'm still dozing off.

Anybody have any tips for overcoming the fatigue? I'm scratching the hell out of my arms and don't have much fingernail left to bite, need something to get through the lull that isn't another cup of coffee. :(

Thank you.

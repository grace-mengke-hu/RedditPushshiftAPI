Keep on Relapsing.

This has been my 4th or 5th attempt at quitting smoking. My last attempt went quite well, I joined a gym and started working out. I felt my energy increase tenfold.I relapse yesterday while taking my driver's licence due to stress and the fact that I've been waking up at an ungodly hour everyday. I also felt that I've been a bit sad when I was smoke free, as if something was missing and even my wife was saying I don't look happy anymore. I was smoke free for about 6 weeks before I gave in. The weird thing is that I felt a slight relief as I drag in that cigarette and I seem to be happier and a bit chattier than my usual brooding and silence self when I was smoke free. Do any if you feel this way?

 what are some of the way you distract yourself when you got these urges. I love breathing in fresh air, tasting food and not smelling like an ashtray but I don't want to feel like there's a void in me.

So proud

Today was the first time I’ve hung out with a smoker since quitting, and it was okay. I really just felt happy I don’t smoke. Granted, it wasn’t a night out drinking, but I am so proud. 

I remember in former quits wanted to snatch the cigarettes right out of people’s hands, and today I felt nothing but grateful that I don’t have to smoke anymore!

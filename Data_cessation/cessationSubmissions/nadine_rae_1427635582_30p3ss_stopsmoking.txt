Habit upon habit

So I've recently decided to quit smoking, as I have been for almost a year. I've found that not just smoking has become a habit, but buying packs, flicking a lighter, oral fixation etc. have become hurdles as well.

In addition to the physicality, I'm overly used to the smell of smoke on my clothes and hands, and having the taste of tobacco lingering in my mouth and tend to feel a little out of place when without. I know it sounds weird.

Its also become a huge crutch for me because I tend to binge smoke when facing emotional turmoil. 

I really want to quit for the sake of my lungs and my prematurely aged skin. Any tips for dealing with said issues?

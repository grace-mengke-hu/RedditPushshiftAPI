What to do instead of smoking?

Hey, I'm perfectly new to this reddit and though I found some similar topics but they didn't really provided the answer for me, although you we all seem to share the same problems.

So I'm almost 24 and I've been smoking for the last 9 years. No need to tell a long story here. I decided to quit last monday and for now it works. The hardest times are the times when I've really enjoyed to have a cigarette or two. Like leaving home to go for work. I have just enough time to smoke one on the way from home to the public transport. Or when we have a break with the colleagues at work. Or when I get bored at a caffe or a restaurant and just want to go out for a couple of minutes.

I don't feel I'm gonna start again because of being bored ofcourse but I do miss it. So what do you do during this times - when you drink your morning coffee, when you walk to somewhere, when you just want to have a break?

waiting for the son to come out

A little past a week, feeling good. My wife could go into labor at any second and we're riding out Irma. A couple of "reasons" to have a smoke, but I'm not going to because I don't want our son to ever know me as a smoker.  And I want to be around for my family as long as possible.

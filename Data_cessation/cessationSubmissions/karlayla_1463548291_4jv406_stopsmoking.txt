Perfect timing for a cold

So I've been doing really well so far. I've even had several days where I didn't even think of smoking once. I feel better in so many ways. Most cravings are more of a passing thought. Easily ignored. Until about a week and a half ago. Now, I don't get near as many cravings as I did when I quit, but suddenly the few I get have been more difficult to talk myself down from. Still doable, but annoying all the same. I started getting a sore throat today and other signs of a cold brewing. I've never been relieved to get a cold in my life! Even when I was a full-blown smoker, I never wanted to smoke through a cold. I did because I was addicted, but I never wanted to. So hoping this cold will push me through whatever is causing these more intrusive thoughts!

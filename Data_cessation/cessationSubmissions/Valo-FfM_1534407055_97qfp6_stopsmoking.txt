Longest Without Cigarettes Since I began Smoking

This is my 16th day and the longest run without smoking I ever achieved.

I once made it to the 15th day but gave in in the evening.

After this 15 day try I couldn´t stay without cigarettes for any longer than 1-3 days.

This time I use a Vape-Pen as NRT since for me it comes to being a smoker or being a vaper and I pick vaping over smoking because I researched the topic quite a bit and am convinced that I will achieve great health improvements just by cutting out cigarettes and regardless if I keep on using nicotine.

Would I wish to quit nicotine completely? 100%. Can I do it at the moment? Probably not.

I wish all of you best of luck to achieve being smokefree and want to encourage all of you to look for a way that works for you and don´t give up on trying to stop smoking.

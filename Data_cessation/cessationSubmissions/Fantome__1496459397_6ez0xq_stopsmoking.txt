I realized something about myself today...

I've been aimless for the majority of my adult life.The stress of feeling like a failure is what drew me to cigarettes to begin with. I'm thinking if I rekindle my sense of purpose I'll be able to quit 100%... I think back on the times I didn't smoke and how unappealing it was to me overall. I started doing it at 19 to fit in with a group of kids, Then I stopped at 20 and didn't smoke until I was 23 when the stress of not living the life I wanted became overwhelming to me. I'm 25 now and I've slowed down A LOT and for the most part I don't crave cigarettes, only when I'm extremely stressed and anxious do I start to crave them as a crutch. I don't like smoking, in fact I hate and find it disgusting, and I only do it socially now . But even that feels like too much to me. In my heart I want to stop. In my heart I know that smoking doesn't define me. And I feel like if I can bring purpose back into my life I can be the smoke free athlete I used to be. I love being alive and I want a great *quality* of life too. I love being active and playing sports and I want t be able to do those things when I'm 70 (if I'm lucky enough to get there.) In total I've only been a smoker for 3 years of my 25 years on this planet, it doesn't define me and it won't be my down fall. And it won't be yours either. Find your purpose, take the power away from the cigarette by replacing it with purposeful actions and morals. We can all Stop this habit, I believe  in myself and I believe in you.

Last night I dreamed I smoked a cigarette and felt awful

In a dream I saw other people smoking and thought "what the hell, I'm just gonna take one". Then I realized I broke the promise to myself that I'll never smoke again and I'll have to start my count of staying smoke free all over again. I felt miserable.

Btw I'm 26 years old, and I stopped smoking one month and 9 days ago. I smoked for 10 years. I'd say that 90% people around me smoke, so I guess it's kind of hard when you're trying to quit, but only in the beginning. 

Since I quit, every day is better and better and I'm really proud of myself for doing it.

Also, since I'm posting for the first time, I just want to thank you all. This reddit has been and still is a huge support and inspiration for me. Stay strong!!!

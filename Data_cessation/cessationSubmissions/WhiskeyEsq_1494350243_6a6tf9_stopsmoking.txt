Fell off the wagon after six months

I'm so ashamed. I had made such great progress and fell off the wagon. Been smoking a half a pack a day for the last month. Trying to grit out and go cold turkey today. First three days are the hardest. Any encouragement you can give me is appreciated. This place helped me a lot when I stopped six months ago.

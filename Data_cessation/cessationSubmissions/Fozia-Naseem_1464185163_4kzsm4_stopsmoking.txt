Does it get better?

I'm 47 and have smoked since I was 16. I have made so many attempts to stop that were not successful but I stopped smoking again just over a month ago and in the last two weeks I've had this mad fever followed by a really bad cough. Docs said it was a chest infection and others saying it was viral. The cough is so bad that on a night I feel like I can't breathe properly and dare not go to sleep thinking I won't wake up! 
I originally stopped using patches but not needed them through this sickness and don't even crave them. I feel this is a result of the bad habit and would never want to return to it again.

I made it a year and a bit!!!

On our anniversary last year, I decided to quit cold turkey after finishing up Easyway. 

I drove to a gas station, tore up the pack, threw out the lighters in my truck and went back to work. 

It's been a year and two weeks and it's still one of the best things I've done. I tried the different methods, but to me, removing Nicotine completely was the only way that's worked. 

No more standing in the cold, smelling like an armpit, sneaking out during work, spending my kids college fund...

Thanks for the suggestion on the book guys. If you haven't already, read it, it's a paradigm shift in the way you think about smoking.

Survived a house party

This weekend I went to a friends birthday party which was also a school reunion.
By the end of the night, everyone was sat around a fire pit smoking and drinking whilst I sat amongst them sober and not smoking.
Not only did I have a really nice night, but I barely had any cravings at all.
Almost 4 weeks of sobriety and no smoking. Never thought I could do it

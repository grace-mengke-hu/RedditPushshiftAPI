Fear of relapse

Dear /r/stopsmoking,

I quit 23 days ago cold turkey. I have several problems with this decision.

I perceived my smoking habit as an anchor to keep sane and to get through everyday life. Although it might be biased, I say I am currently suffering mentally more than before.

My reasons to quit are somewhat dubious, I would go as far as to say I cannot formulate them. I have no outside support. I do not value the health benefits. I see no moral obligations to refrain from cigarette smoking.

My first try failed after 3 days (after some drinks and in a local bar). I remember the contempt I felt for myself. If I started again now, I would feel very bad.

I think I have only made it this far because I could change my daily routine massively the last weeks. With the semester starting soon, I fear I maybe cannot uphold this.

What to do?

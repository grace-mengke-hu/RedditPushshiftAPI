First time smoking in my dream... Wild!

After reading numerous accounts of people smoking in their dreams, I had my first taste and it was a wild experience. I felt guilt, shame, disappointment in myself and other emotions I don't usually associate with dreaming. Also I was surrounded by everyone who knows I have recently quit and they were all giving me dirty looks... whew was I glad to wake up feeling great and still being smoke free for 15 days, Whoop!

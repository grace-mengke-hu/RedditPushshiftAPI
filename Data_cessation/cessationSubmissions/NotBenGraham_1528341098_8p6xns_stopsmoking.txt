20 days clean. I haven't felt this good in ages.

I finally reached 20 days! Since starting my quit, I've felt stronger and faster. My breathing is easier and my recovery is much faster after during exercise. I don't worry about my smell or smoking related had breath anymore. And I also have more time, rather than spending it puffing away. 

I feel more focused and less distracted to get my nicotine pump. 

The urges have started to dissipate. I can finally drink coffee without craving a cancer stick. 

There were so many times I wanted to just give in. But I told myself that if I did it "just one time" I can do it "just one time" again. 

This is only 20 days but I wanted to share my progress :)

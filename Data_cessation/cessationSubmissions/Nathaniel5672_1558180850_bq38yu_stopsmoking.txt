Preparing to quit, could really do with some advice of where to start!

So I'm 24 and I've been smoking for almost 10 years. Recently it's taking its toll, I've been prescribed my first inhaler since secondary school and I physically struggle to keep up with myself. I have two very active jobs, I'm also a musician who enjoys singing for leisure. I recently tried to quit after a week off work from a chest infection, but after a stressful shift I feel straight back into it. I've booked an appointment with my GP but it's not until the 27th. A friend of mine has the Allen Carr book, which they're hopefully bringing me later today. I would really appreciate some advice from people who have managed to quit already, especially for the first few days / weeks. This seems like such a supportive community, it's already reassuring seeing so many success stories!

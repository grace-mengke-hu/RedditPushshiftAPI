3 days in - the worst is over!

I am happy to notice that the the urges are getting less strong! The first days were challenging - in fact I already had several failed attempts to quit in the days before - but I managed to push through this time! I feel like the most challenging part is over now. Sure, I expect many urges, but they will last slower and they are less strong. I know this because I have quit so many times now.

Last attempts lasted 2 months. Then I got stupid. I had a very exceptional situation, and somehow I gave in. I learned my lesson. Will make some lifestyle changes to reduce the chance of this happening again. That said, I smoked 1.5 package before quitting again, so I am still doing pretty good. There were times when I smoked that amount every day.

However, the goal is to not smoke at all, and I will keep pursuing it, even if I fail regularly for the rest of my life.

But of course, I expect to be successful!

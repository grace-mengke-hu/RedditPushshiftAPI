Today is the day

It's 5am. I woke up with an unstoppable coughing, and I'm afraid it's due to cigarettes (though it may be a part of a cold).
 It's been a decade since I started smoking. I realized long ago cigarettes were not "cool", and I know addiction took possession of my brain. The proof is that five minutes ago, I took my pack, and destroyed all the cigarettes in it. All but one. While I was holding it in my hand, I asked myself "smoke this last cigarette, as a goodbye". I didn't enjoy it. I never enjoy a cig, but this time I had an excuse to smoke, trying to be poetic in the middle of the night. I'm tired of this gollum-like mind I have. How ridiculous I can be sometimes...

I stopped drinking thanks to Reddit and with all my heart, I want to stop smoking too. I know for sure quitting an addiction is hard as fuck, my brain had too much nasty habits that I can't ignore it. 

The good part is that I did destroyed my pack of cigarettes. I'll go to work in a couple of hours, and I know I won't have my morning cig. Hope I won't have in all the mornings of my (I hope long) life.

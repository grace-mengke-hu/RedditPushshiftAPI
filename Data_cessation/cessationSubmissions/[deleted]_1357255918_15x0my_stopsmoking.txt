Starting day 3 with the patch

Wow, today is sooooooooo much better than the last two.

Problem was, even the highest step patch put me in withdrawals because I had been smoking up to 1.5-2 packs a day. 

Day 2 I woke up in a horrible panic. Tight chest, fast heartbeat, overwhelming cravings.  When I was a smoker, I wanted one in the morning, but never woke up in a giant craving panic. That was hard.

Day 3: woke up without panic! The mental thought of smoking was there, but the physical feelings faded in a couple of minutes tops. 

I'm also using a Blu e-cig..Just a few puffs a day for extreme times...like when I'm lacing up my shoes, ready to go to the store to buy smokes because I can't take it anymore. 

I wouldn't recommend the two together, just because of the medical dangers of too much nicotine, but just sayin'. 

I have managed the car rides without issue. Gum helps. 

I do *not* plan to go to a bar soon. I had a beer last night at home and it was a huge trigger. No more of that for now. 

One last thing: I have read The Easy Way book in the past and even read it yesterday for good measure. I know this subreddit is really pro-cold turkey. 
If it works for you, hurrah! If it doesn't, don't feel bad about it. I think it is better to quit using crutches than to not quit at all!

3 weeks and going strong

Boy, am I glad I've been really busy. I haven't had time to think about smoking. When I do, it's only because I get a whiff of the smell from someone else. 

Other than that it's been really good. I haven't really been having cravings. I just get slight urges but I'm able to extinguish them right away by just thinking of how awful I felt as I was smoking my last one 3 weeks ago. Very strange because in the numerous times that I've quit, this is the only attempt where the idea of lighting up was off putting rather than tempting.

Patiently waiting for my badge to turn into a star. So close! Stay strong, everyone.

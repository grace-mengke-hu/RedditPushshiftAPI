What to do when I'm most vulnerable? In social situations, waiting.

These tempting moments where you stand somewhere and got some time to pass are the worst if other people are around me due to slight social anxiety. 

I feel like a cigarette instantly gives me a justification to be there, as stupid as it may sound. No, I'm not standing here and wait awkwardly, I stand here because I'm enjoying my smoke. Know what I mean?

With a phone, I could play some game instead or read the news (again), but it still has a bit of this "Why am I standing here?"-flavor for me. Look at this guy, he's standing there checking his phone like we don't know he just doesn't wants to look into peoples faces.

What do I do instead? I think my anxiety might get better if I stopped smoking, but it's difficult to get there

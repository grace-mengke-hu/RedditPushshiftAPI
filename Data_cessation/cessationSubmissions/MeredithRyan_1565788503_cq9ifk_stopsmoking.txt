Used to think it was impossible. Happy 6 months to my lungs

Today is my 6 months and 2 hours smoke free. Completely smoke free. Finally, this quit I didn’t waiver, haven’t tried to sneak a hit and haven’t even touched a single cigarette. 

Listen to others advice and read the easy way to quit. It helps. It’s mainly a firm resolve and promise to yourself that your future, looks (if it motivates you), finances and family are far more important than those cigarettes are. There are days now I rarely member to remember the desire for a smoke. Those are good days and they’re possible. 
Always “not another puff, NO MATTER WHAT”

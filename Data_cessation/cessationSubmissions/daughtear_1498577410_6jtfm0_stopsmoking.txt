Will I be able to keep it up?

I have been smoking on and off for 5-6 years and i smoke 4 cigs a day. No more no less. However, i am thinking of getting pregnant someday soon and i really need to get it out of my system. 

So i have quitted smoking for 3 days now. I am on holiday and it is easier when i am on holiday, but my work is stressful and i feel like tomorrow noon, i will be lighting a cig and keep going. I am already stressed out and feel like will not be able to cope. But i can, right?

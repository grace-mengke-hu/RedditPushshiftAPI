How to deal with the physical pain?

I stopped smoking cigarettes almost 2 years ago, and picked up vaping.  I recently decided that it was time to change my life (exercise, diet, and give up the nicotine).  I went down to 0mg of nicotine in my Vape yesterday, and thought that just getting the oral fixation from using the Vape would help me throughout the day.  But, there is this constant tingling/pain in my neck, hands, knees, feet, and legs.  After dealing with the pain for 5-6 hours yesterday, I had an old Patch around the house and threw that on.  But, I have no more and don't want to buy anymore.  Anyone have any suggestions on how to deal with this pain?  Is this normal? 

tl;dr:  Trying to stop using Nicotine all together, constant pain/tingling sensation through-ought my limbs and neck.  Is this normal?  How do I cope with it?

The dreaded car ride!

That moment when you first get In the car, hit the freeway or a stop light are such huge triggers for me to light up. Well so apparently driving in general signals to my brain that it's time to smoke. I have to drive 45 mins to work and usually smoke about 3 on my way. 

How did you handle car rides after or should I say while quitting?

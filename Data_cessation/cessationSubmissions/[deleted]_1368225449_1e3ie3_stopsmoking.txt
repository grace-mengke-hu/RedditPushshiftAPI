Quit smoking Monday, it's Friday and I'm still alive! Questions about the Patch..

This is the first time I've quit using the Patch. I've stopped smoking before, for years at a time but always go back into it, so this is probably the 10th or so serious quit time I have gone through. I sincerely want this, I'm 36 and can't see myself growing old and weezing my way into an earlier death. Anyhow, if any of you have used the patch I would love for you to provide a bit of insight..

My heart palpitates from time to time, and I get an occasional tightness in my chest, then it turns into a mild panic attack. Is that normal? Never had it before when I quit cold turkey. 

Will my foggy brain state last this whole several week process? I just feel so disjointed on this and it's already been a few days, will I adjust?

Would it just be easier cold turkey? This almost seems like a long drawn out withdrawl torture. 

Do I look like a weirdo in my tank top with a big nicotine patch on my arm?

I'm afraid to wear it near my heart for some reason, is there any reason why I shouldn't? Did you have effectiveness if you put it below your navel? Some say you have to wear it on your upper body.

Hopefully this will all get easier as I go along..

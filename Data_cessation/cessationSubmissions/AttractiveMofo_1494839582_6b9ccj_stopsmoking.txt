Quit smoking, everything is different?

Hey guys, I quit smoking around 3 months ago by vaping. Now I want to quit vaping (used to smoke 18mg nicotine juice), I haven't for 3 days now which is awesome but I have noticed a lot of changes.

First of all, I don't feel the need to smoke. And I don't feel horrible at all. My concentration has never been the same, I can concentrate for hours, and I have a fuck ton of energy and motivation.

The second thing is something I'm really happy about. I suffer from a really severe nice guy syndrome. Never speaking my mind, always putting other people's interest before mine and letting people screw me over because I want to be a "nice person". Since I stopped taking in so much nicotine I'm the complete opposite. 
I'm not afraid to speak my mind and my heart is calm when I get into a conflict (my heart used to start beating really fast almost not allowing me to breath when I got into a conflict). 

Does this have to do with anxiety? Has anyone had similar experiences? It's just like I'm more "alpha male" now. 

Please share your experiences. Has stopping smoking brought you a "new personality" that you're proud of?

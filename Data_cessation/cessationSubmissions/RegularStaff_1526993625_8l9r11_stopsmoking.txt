went to see my no smoking lady

was struggling a bit, even with NRT, but have made it to 3 weeks, 1 day with only half a drag that was instantly regretted (didnt feel the need to reset clock at this point)
Been given some gum to try for during the day, but now feeling good and positive for the future.

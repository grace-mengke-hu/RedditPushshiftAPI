Almost 6 years!

Just noticed I'm almost at 6 years, holy hell. Doesn't even feel like I was ever a pack-a-day smoker anymore.

Just wanted to drop in and say that I haven't felt anything resembling a craving since, well, a couple of months after quitting. Why do I feel the need to come and share this? Because I distinctly remember my mother, way back in the day, telling anecdotes of an uncle who had "quit smoking", and who craved after cigarettes even after years of having quit. That thought kept me from trying for a good long while, and I'm glad to report that it's complete horseshit.

Anyway, thanks to this community, and thanks to Allen Carr. Probably leading a healthier life now that I otherwise would have thanks to you guys!

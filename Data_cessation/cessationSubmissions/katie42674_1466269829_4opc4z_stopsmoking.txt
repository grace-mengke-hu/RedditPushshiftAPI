Crossed the two week mark!

Went out drinking with friends. Didn't smoke. 
Forgot to pack my NRT for a four-day trip. Still didn't smoke. 
Got some bad news. Still didn't smoke. 
Found a leftover pack in my drawers. Still didn't smoke. 

You are stronger than those little bastards, no matter how many times they make you think otherwise. Just keep going. You can do it!

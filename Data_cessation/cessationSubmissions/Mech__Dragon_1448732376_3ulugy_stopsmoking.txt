Day 39 1/2. I could smell 2nd hand residue on me this AM. I puked.

Last night I went to hang out with my brother. I hadn't seen him in a year, and I might as well make the effort to go say hi while I am in town.

4 of his roommates smoke cigs. We all hung out in the garage for at least 2 hours. No ventilation aside from opening/closing the garage door twice.

I go home and pass out. I wake up to the stench of 2nd hand residue on my arm. It's 5 am, I shake it off, but my stomach starts to turn. At 6 am I get another strong wiff of my arm. I instantly have to run to the bathroom and empty my stomach.

What a morning. At least my brother is doing alright.

Productive cough

Haven't had a smoke in 3 days and I have an awful productive cough. When I exhale too deep I hear and feel a rattle deep in my chest and then cough up some more junk. 

Is this normal? I've read through various sources that reproducing cilia will lead to a productive coug lasting some weeks. 

Any advice?

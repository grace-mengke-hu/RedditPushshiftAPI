Help boufriend quit

Hi all, 
My boyfriend (39) has pretty much been smoking since he was 15. I don’t care at all about the smell and inconvenience (I myself drink smoke) but what really gets me is the damage to his health &amp; how expensive it is. Cigarettes here are like $13 a pack. I’ve been trying for over a year to get him to quit (and he definitely understands and wants to). However, there’s been no real effort on his part. I’m very explicit in expressing my disapproval and always offer to buy patches but he seems to kind of have an excuse of it not being a good time. 

What are some ways I can press him on it but not sound like a bitch?

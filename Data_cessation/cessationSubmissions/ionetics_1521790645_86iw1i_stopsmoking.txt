I really want a smoke!

Goddammit, I just woke up and am crying because I can't have a fag. I don't know why I'm crying! I'm crying because I'm booking a 50th birthday trip as a treat for my best friend and I love her so much and she's had such shitty luck in her life! I'm crying because my 25 year old son smokes and I wish he didn't, but I smoked when I was pregnant and all his life so it's my fault. I'm crying because it used to feel so comforting and calming to have a smoke when crying, so if I cry maybe I'll NEED to have a cig to calm me down. 


Goddammit- time for a rage-crave walk with the dog, tears streaming down my face. The neighbours all know I'm crazy anyway so what the fuck else is new.

My little matra that helped me make it to day 7 for the first time after several attempts over the years.

Once you start quitting, the decision to quit is made.  
  
Postponing the quit date is not an option. Bumming a smoke on campus is not a valid option. Buying a pack, smoking 3 and giving the rest to a hobo is *not* an option.  
  
Now that you've decided to quit there are only two options.  
Weakness or strength. 
 
Every time you crave a cigarette, you can chose to be strong and overcome it, or be weak and cave in. Don't let your nicotine fiend brain justify cheating, because  it will try. Know that any drag on a cigarette, no matter what goofy excuse your addict brain concocts is still an act of weakness.  
  
Every time you get a craving ask yourself the simple question, "Will I be weak right now or strong?" not, "Ok... if I have one cigarette is it really a relapse?" or "One drag on one smoke is hardly even a hit of nicotine, like I'm still technically trying to quit"  
 
The only question to answer is am I weak or am I strong. 
  
 

sorry if this is a kind of cheesy motivational rant, but it's the one thing that did it for me. Not allowing overly complex justifications and thought processes to hijack my attempt to quit. Reducing every temptation to one single question: Gonna be weak right now or gonna be strong bro?

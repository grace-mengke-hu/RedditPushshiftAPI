Am I supposed to still crave smoking while on NRT?

Hey guys, when does the cravings really go away? I'm using lozenges for the past 30 days and I was smoke free. But after having a particular stressful event y'day the craving for smoking was so strong that I lighted up a few ciggs y'day. Damn, when will these cravings ever go away?

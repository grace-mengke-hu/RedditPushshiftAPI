Thank you, day one of not using the patch or cigarettes

Thank you for the encouragement! I was smoking a little, but quit that on the patch after a while. Had to just take it off for a day when I bought a pack. Now I'm day 3 with no cigarettes, I took off the patch, and put on my badge :). This sub always pushes me further and I hope it's the last time I ever smoke. I still have 2 refills on my patches too lol

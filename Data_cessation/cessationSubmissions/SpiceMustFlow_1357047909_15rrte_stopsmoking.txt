Just started 'The Easy Way'. I am currently on the e-cig/80, analog/20 percent. I hope to only use the e-cig while reading the book, starting NOW and we'll see what I do by the time I finish the book. 

So many recommend the book here. I hope I am capable of letting it brainwash me ( I mean that in a good way). I always thought of myself as someone who can't be manipulated. Will Alan Carr be able to manipulate me? Let's see....

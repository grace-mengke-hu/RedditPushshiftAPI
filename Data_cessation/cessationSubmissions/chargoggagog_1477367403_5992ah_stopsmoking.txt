Tried and failed before, gonna quit right now

I smoke cigars and inhale, 2x a day.  I need to quit.  I have a 2 year old and I don't want to let her grow up with half a dad.

Any tips?  Should I try the patch or just tough it out?  I've quit before and been successful, but now I'm having a tough time. Last time I quit by betting a friend I could and if I lost I'd have to send him cash.  It worked and I quit for years.  I'll do that again, any other tips?

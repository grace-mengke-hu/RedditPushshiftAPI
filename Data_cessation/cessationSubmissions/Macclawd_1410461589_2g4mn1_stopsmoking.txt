Day 16 and doing great

I'm doing it great and i'm feeling even better, last week was dangerous but i didn't fail.

during the weekend i had a barbecue, a lot of food, a lot of beer and a lot of heavy smokers, but i discover my self saying no thanks i don't smoke any more.

Then on monday i need to travel for job reasons a big meeting giving a presentation in a foreing languaje plus long nights borring and alone but i resist and today i feel great, lets go for the rest of my live!

On my 5th day...

I’m on my 5th day and tears are falling from my face....Day 3 and 4th has been so hard and today i feel sad. I have been feeling like when I was smoking, i love that version of me. I stop smoking not because I din’t like it anymore, i actually love smoking. I stop to be a better version of myself and wanted to give my body a better healt. But today i’m sitting here and I have these thought about when I was something (even if it only been 5 days) on how everything seem better because you would stop and have a break for a cigarette, when you walk, well it was fun because you could have a cigarette. I feel like the old gigi was more fun. This weekend i’m going to a cottage with some friends and the are a few people who smoke.. it will be so hardest moment I think... can someone help me with maybe thoughts i could keep in mind when i’ll  be around smoker at a campfire? Thanks,

Please help, I don't if this is relapsed

yesterday I drank a lot, Late at night I drank a big gin and tonic, I went home, drunk, I was very sad because the women I love does not find me attractive, I took a sleeping pill drank some relaxing tea...right before going to sleep I was on facebook just looking at her profile...I grabbed a cigarette ( from a pack of cigarettes I purchased on Saturday) and I lit up! I smoke the entire cigarette and went to sleep. This morning I woke up sad because Of the cigarette, threw the pack away and took a shower. I don't even remember the cigarette, i just know I smoked it. Should I reset my counter?

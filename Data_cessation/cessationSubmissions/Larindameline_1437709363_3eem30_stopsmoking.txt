Smoking patterns

I'm 13 days smoke free, and naively, I thought I was in the clear (very silly). 

I pulled out my ukulele tonight, and I haven't played it yet as a nonsmoker. Immediately, my brain said "well you can't play without a cigarette." Then I started to feel grief at the loss of all the good times I had smoking and playing my instrument. 

It sounds insane, but it's another pattern. Like I'm finding that even talking to people on the phone that I used to chain smoke on the phone with triggers me to want to smoke. 

I'm really surprised at the grief of the loss of that. Anyone have experience with this? And does it settle down after you create enough new patterns? 

Like, will taking a road trip trigger me cause I haven't done it yet as a nonsmoker? 

Feel like I'm learning to live or walk again...

A Couple Question About Quitting

So I was at my doctor's today and he said I should really quit smoking (cause no duh that's what doctors do.) I'd probably go cold Turkey, but I might try gum or a patch, not too sure right now. But I was wondering if it'd be any help to trying to cut back a bit before quitting, or if there are any good pre quitting habits to develop? Like I've been smoking a lot less lately mainly because it's been -20c on some days, so that's good. 

So have some of you gone from like 25 a day to 0 overnight, or should I try to cut back maybe get down to no more than 5 a day then quit? Also do you guys have any tips for cutting back? I find making a huge meal can delay a smoke by up to about an hour. Also when I'm distracted it's easier to lose track of time and not smoke, but I have to be doing something new and engaging, not like the same video game I've played for a year. Oh and the last one I've heard is cut out your very first smoke of the day, cause I always make coffee and have a smoke first thing in the morning.

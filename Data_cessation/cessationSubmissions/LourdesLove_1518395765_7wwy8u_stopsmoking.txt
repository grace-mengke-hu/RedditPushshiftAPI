I don’t care if I gain weight.

I see a lot of people saying that they are afraid to gain weight if they quit smoking. I was one of those people. I am currently struggling with my weight and trying to lose weight. I love working out but can’t due to smoking I don’t. I have so many problems due to smoking. 

So I decided to stop letting the fear of gaining weight be the reason I don’t quit. Bring on the pounds!! Because I’ll be working out way more and with more efficiency once I’m an ex smoker. A new goal to reach once I’ve kicked this habit. 

So if your worried about weight gain don’t. Unless you have a medical condition that will get worse with weight gain a few extra pounds is honestly worth not killing yourself. 

If you can quit smoking then you can lose those pesky pounds. In fact if you can quit smoking you can do anything!!! 

Day 5 of no smoking for me. Let’s do this!!!

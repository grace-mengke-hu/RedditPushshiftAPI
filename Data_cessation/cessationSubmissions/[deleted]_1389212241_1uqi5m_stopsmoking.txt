Day 2 without cigarettes. Why I quit.

Hello r/stopsmoking. How's it going?

first a little backstory:
I'm 20 years and have been smoking cigarettes for about 3 years, not regularly but rather on "special" occasions for example when i'm out drinking. I only smoke (or used to smoke) cigarettes every day in certain periods of time, as vacations.  

I would like to start of easy: I need to quit smoking, as it's simply getting too unhealthy and expensive as well as it kind of makes me tired and unmotivated right after smoking a cigarette. I would also be able to run for longer than 5 minutes without having to to stop and get my breath back. 




**Reasons to why I don't want to quit smoking:**

I like the feeling

It's kind of a social thing to do


It looks kind of cool  

**Reasons to why I want to quit smoking:**

I want to live to see my grandchildren

I want to save money

I want to get in a better shape

I don't want to smell cigarettes all the time

I don't want to yellow my teeth any more

I feel guilty when I take a smoke break from work/school







 As you probably see does the stop-smoking outweigh the pre-smoking list by far. This is why I will do my best to not even touch a cigarette in the upcoming days, weeks, and hopefully years.

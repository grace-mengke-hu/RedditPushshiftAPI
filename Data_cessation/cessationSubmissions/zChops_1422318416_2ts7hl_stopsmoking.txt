Took my last drag

As I finished my pack and smoked the last drag of my cigarette, I decide it was the last one. I stopped for 4 months a year ago and never felt better, started up again and now I feel like shit. I'm tired of feeling like I need a smoke break, and tired of the financial burden smoking has caused me.  10 minutes and counting.

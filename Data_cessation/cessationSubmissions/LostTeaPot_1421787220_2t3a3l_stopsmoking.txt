Its not a problem for the future.

I'm only 18, but had been smoking for a year and a half until last Monday. I'm a smart guy, and my school always used to bombard us with the facts about smoking. Even so once I started I just enjoyed it and thought about its repercussions as something that would only affect me down the road. What changed my mind is breaking my leg (how that happened is a whole other story). Its just the end of the fibula but its been in a cast for a week and I'm having surgery tomorrow for it. Anyone with a leg cast is at risk of blood clots, and surgery carries its own risks regardless. What's made me stop is realising how much smoking increased the risk factors for both of these. Being stuck in my Uni flat has made it easy so far but when I'm properly mobile again and going out its going to be a little more tricky.

At 55 hours now...

So a little over two full days at this point. I hoped the cravings would have lessened even a little at this point, since I seem to be giving my vape the hug of death. However, I guess it takes a while to untangle 29 years of addiction from the brain.

This is a "do or die" juncture - my second-most common quit quitting point (the first being <24 hours). If I can make it through the next 24 hours, I will continue to have a fighting chance! But damn it's hard.

I keep telling myself a line from the show "Kimmy Schmidt" that you can survive anything for at least 10 seconds. And when those 10 seconds are up, you start over and survive the next 10 seconds...

What do you guys do to get past cravings?

Hi there! I've lurked in this subreddit for a couple months now and finally on a whim decided to quit. After watching the Allen Carr video, I find it really easy to be around people who smoke, since I can look at them, can smell them and am proud of myself for not smoking (majority of my friends/co-workers smoke). Its when I have downtime, usually on my own, that the real cravings hit. I know its all in my head, but when its just me, on my own, its a real struggle. I know theres no easy fix, but what you do guys do to get past these 3minutes of agony?

You guys have been a real help in me making the decision to stop! Thanks

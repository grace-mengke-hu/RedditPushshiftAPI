After two weeks I caved and regret it

I'm currently in the process of buying my first house which is super stressful. After not smoking for two weeks I caved with the stress and had a cigarette. 
I need to find other ways of dealing with this stress that doesn't involve nicotine 
Any ideas gratefully received

I only smoked 6 packs in 2 months and I’m having cravings! Can’t imagine what y’all feel

I smoked sporadically, I have little self-control. At first I was just mixing tobacco with weed, then started bumming then bought my own. My dad is a god of willpower. He has run 30 marathons and works hard. That said, he’s been using nicotine gum for 20 years. My brother has been chewing for 7 years and tried quitting but only lasted 10 days. What a monkey on your backs! I used heroin for 2 months about 6 years ago, and I have to say, the similarities are striking. Thinking about it first thing when you wake up, feeling almost a drop in your stomach when you know you can’t have it, etc etc. 

Y’all that smoked daily for extended periods and are quitting now are fucking warriors. Like I said, if this is how I feel after only 2 months of smoking, I can’t imagine how you feel.

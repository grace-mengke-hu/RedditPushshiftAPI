Smoker’s Hand?

I don’t know what the hell you call it, but I’m referring to the stained, stinky tips of the index and middle fingers on your smoking hand. Any advice on how to speed up the process of getting rid of the smell? I washed all my clothes but all I can smell is my hand when it gets anywhere near my face. The last time I quit it took around two weeks of hand scrubbing and sanitizer.

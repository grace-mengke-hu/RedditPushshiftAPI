Day two, caved.

I'm 24 and have been a pack a day smoker since I was about 16. I'm desperate to quit. I hate the fact that I'm a smoker and hate what I'm doing to my body. I just caved after 2 days without, but managed to stub it after 2 puffs and proceeded to tell myself what an idiot I am. I think the boredom is almost worse than the cravings. Anyone with experience have advice on how to get through the worst of it? How long do the cravings last?

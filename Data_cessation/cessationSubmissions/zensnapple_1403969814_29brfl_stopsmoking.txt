Ever dream about having a smoke?

I'm at 9 months after smoking for 5 years, and at this point it's no challenge to turn down a cig, even in my drunkest of moments. I still have triggers (when I roll the window down in a car, or after a large meal) where I want a cig for about half a second, then remember I don't smoke, and never will again. 

That being said, I've had the dream a few times in the last month or two where I get handed a smoke, and tell myself, "aww what the hell, it's just one." and smoke it. Everything is extremely vivid and realistic. I feel it going into my lungs, I taste it, I see the cherry get brighter, I see the smoke come out of my mouth, then feel bad about myself and wake up. Anyone else experience anything like this?

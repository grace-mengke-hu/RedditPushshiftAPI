1 week check in!

I'd like to thank everyone from this forum! Your posts were always encouraging and they really helped me get trough some cravings in the first few days!
So my experience so far:
- 
Breathing is more enjoyable than ever! Not running out of breath in a few minutes is super great
-
 Not smelling like an ashtray really helps make new contacts!
- 
Definitely feeling more relaxed now!
- 
Not spending cash on cigarettes when going to the store is fucking great, instead I can buy whatever catches my eye. 
- 
-
Not having a heavy feeling in my chest every morning is the best fucking thing ever!

Stay strong brothers and sisters!

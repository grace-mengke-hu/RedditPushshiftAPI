Today was my first day cigarette free!!

I have been wanting to quit for a little while now but today is the day I have officially not smoked a single cigarette! I used to e cig today with 3 mg of nicotine but it felt like I was cheating! I plan on being completely free of nicotine by Saturday then the real fight starts! I had a hard enough time today but I feel like this time will be the time I'm completely off of them wish me luck!!

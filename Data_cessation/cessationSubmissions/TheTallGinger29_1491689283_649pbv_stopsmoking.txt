Today marks day one, any tips or support would be amazing!

So today marks day number one of quitting. I've been a smoker for 10 years and have finally decided that enough is enough. My friend couldn't recommend this sub enough as it really helped him quit, and I was just really hoping for some support or some tips! Thanks guys. :)

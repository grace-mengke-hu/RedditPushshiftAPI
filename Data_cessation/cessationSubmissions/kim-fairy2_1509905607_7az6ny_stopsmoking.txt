I need some support

This is my fourth day and I seem to not know how to enjoy myself without cigs anymore. 

I am doing a lot of fun stuff. Socializing, hobbies, etc. And I do like doing it, it's just.. I keep wanting to take a break and smoke. I do take little breaks, like enjoying a drink or browsing reddit, etc. but I miss that little pick me up. I know it's just the nicotine monster fighting for its life but.. I'm kinda scared I'll give in.

In the evening I smoke hasj with tea leaves  (so no tobacco) and I'm so relieved to smoke that, because at least it tastes a bit like smoking and it's relaxing. But I hate needing that, though I know I'll quit hasj when the time is right.

The only thing that has really made me not crave a smoke was today, when I had walked for 2 hours. But it didn't last long. 

I have a vapor without nicotine. It didn't seem to help at first but I noticed that it did when I went outside with it, as I would with a cigarette. So I hope this'll be enough for me.

Any stories, tips or words of support are really appreciated!!

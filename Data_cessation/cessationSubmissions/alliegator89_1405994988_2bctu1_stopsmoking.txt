What is the most creative thing you've done to help quit?

Just wondering how creative you all have been in your quitting efforts.  A lot of the tips I have read all start to sound the same after a while.  I want as big of an arsenal of quitting tips as possible. (Also, sorry if my grammar is bad...I can't think straight for longer than 3 seconds)

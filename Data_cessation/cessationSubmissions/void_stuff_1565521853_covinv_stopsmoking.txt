How do I convince my mom to stop smoking?

My mom is almost fifty and has been smoking since her teenage years. All my life I’ve been subjected to her habit and have frequently tried to persuade her to put her health first and stop smoking. I’m really worried that if she keeps on smoking she’ll end up hurting her health.

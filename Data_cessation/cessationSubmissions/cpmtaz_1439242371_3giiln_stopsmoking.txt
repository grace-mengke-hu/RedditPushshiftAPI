Weird symptoms after quitting, anyone else?

Today is 9 days and I started to notice a couple days ago this foul taste in the back of my throat. It tastes like terrible breath smells, but my breath doesn't smell. (I also have excellent dental hygiene, thankyouverymuch) Also, for a couple days now it feels like there's something stuck in the back of my throat, behind my uvula but nothing is back there! WTH? Has anyone else had these symptoms and when will they go away??

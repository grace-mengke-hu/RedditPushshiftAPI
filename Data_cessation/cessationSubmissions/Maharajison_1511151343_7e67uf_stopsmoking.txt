I'm almost at a week!

I stopped smoking and drinking (because I'd drink through my resolve to refrain from cigarettes), about a week ago. I already feel like I'm over the hardest part, and I'm proud of how I'm spending my time and saving even more money.

I opened a savings account a few months ago and have been putting a big chunk of my checks in it, and now, at this rate, I'll be able to nearly double the monthly deposit amounts in 2018.

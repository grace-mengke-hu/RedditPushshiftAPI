21 years is too long. I think I'm ready to quit. Wish me luck? Got a mantra to share?

Hi fellow quitters. 

I'm on the edge of quitting. I've been smoking for 21 years. Sweet Jesus. That's way too long! I have two cigarettes left and I don't plan on buying any more. 

... I think.


I smoke only

while driving to work and back (2 each way) 

in the evenings when my kids are in bed (3 or 4)

.. but on the weekends or evenings when I don't have my kids? A pack a day :( 

I've been stumbling alone trying to quit but I really do enjoy it. I enjoy the downtime, the relaxing..  Please offer your words of wisdom and support? Thank you!

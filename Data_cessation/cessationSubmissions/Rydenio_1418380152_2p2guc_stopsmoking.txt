I come here somethimes just to check my badge since it's the easiest way to know how long it's been...

And I thought his time I'd leave a message for everyone who's thinking about quitting, recently quit or is having a hard time with it in general. I see a lot of people with short times since they quit, and I just want to say it gets easier. You will stop thinking about it and you will be fine.

I thought I would never feel normal again, I feared losing my girlfriend and my job, but relly, just get through three weeks and you will do even better than before!

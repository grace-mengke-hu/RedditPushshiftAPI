Tomorrow is finally the day

I’m mostly posting this for myself to reflect on, but after 15 years of smoking the day has finally come. I’ve been cig free for 2 weeks today, but have been using a vape and a Juul to get my nic fix. I bought the gum and wanted to ween off but I think I’d rather just rip the bandaid off now instead of getting addicted to gum. Fortunately I will be working from home over the next 2 weeks which should help the irritability associated with nic withdrawals. I do have some 0 nic vape juice and I’m wondering if I’m okay to use that, or if it will make me want to smoke more. I feel like I’m already anxious about getting a “cold turkey flu”. This community has helped me a lot in coming to this decision, and whatever happens thank you all!

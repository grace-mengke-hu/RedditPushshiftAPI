I'm fine while at work, but the moment I clock out it hits me.

I have tried and failed many times to quit smoking, but I really want to succeed this time.  The thing I don't understand is that while I am at work, I can go 5-8 hours without even thinking about a cigarette, but the second I punch out it's there like a raging monster.  

Anyone have some suggestions on how to trick my brain?

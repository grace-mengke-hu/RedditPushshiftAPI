eightyfive days. and i'm scared

So i quit smoking 85 days ago. And it was surprisingly easy. I decided to give it a try after a total change of my surroundings. I moved abroad for 6 months, that was exactly 3 months ago. I brought one pack of cigarettes with me, finished that in my first week and never bought another pack. There weren't any cravings, apart from sometimes smoking a cigarette in my dreams, if that counts?

I think the reason it was so easy for me was that i was more of a social smoker. I very very seldomly went for a cigarette alone, but a lot of my friends were smokers, and as i enjoyed nothing more than being with my friends i smoked quite a lot.

Now that i have new friends, most of them non-smokers, i'm not tempted to smoke. And it's really nice knowing i don't have to smoke, even if one of the smokers goes for a cigarette. 2 months ago i still might have gotten weak and joined them for one. But now i know i'm stronger than that. I don't need to smoke.

But i'm afraid. In a week, my best friend from home will come to visit me. She knows i'm not smoking anymore. She's fucking proud of me, and i'm sure she won't offer me a cig in the one week she'll stay here. But not knowing how i'll react to having a part of my "old surroundings" around me really scares me. I just really hope, that in two weeks from now, i can say i had the strength to now smoke and my badge will say 99 days, and not 0 again.

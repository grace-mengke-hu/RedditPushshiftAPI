Mildly addicted. Trying to quit. Feeling the urge.

I smoked (past tense is optimistic to be honest) 4-6 cigs, usually in the evening before bed. It'd be my wind-down. This is regularly for about two years.

I'm trying to quit. Switched to e-cigs for craving. I think my previous amount meant I wasn't massively addicted, but I quit mainly due to health reasons - I saw and heard too many people with cancer and I didn't want that to happen to me or even my family.

But I'm craving a cig right now. I got an urge. I'm two days in to quitting, and thinking smoking 1-2 wouldn't do any harm.

Help me! Because I'm tempted. What works as a way to get through those intense urges?

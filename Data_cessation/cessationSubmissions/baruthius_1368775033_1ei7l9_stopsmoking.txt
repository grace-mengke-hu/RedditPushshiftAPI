I'm currently at 43 days, but I need some advice

I'm 18 years old, but I've been smoking for about three years now (started early- really really bad idea), and before I decided to quit, I was at a pack a day. I've gone completely cold turkey. No gum, no e-cigarettes, nothing of that sort. Getting off of nicotine 100%. I'm in physical/mental pain, but that's normal and it's not my main concern. 

I'm going to college in a few months, and my roommate is a smoker. I'm assuming that by three months from now, it will have gotten much easier, but I'm really scared that living with a smoker will make the temptation much greater. 

Any words of wisdom on how to resist the urges while living with someone (whom I really like, and want to room with. So I don't want to find another roommate) that smokes?

Anything is much appreciated. Thank you, friends!

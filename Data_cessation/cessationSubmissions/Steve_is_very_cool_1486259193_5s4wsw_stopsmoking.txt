Quitting smoking. No...quitting nicotine in general.

I am going to quit. I have been trying to stop smoking unsuccessfully for so long. I have been smoking since I was 16, and am now 23. I vaped for a year in 2015, which left me ten times more addicted to nicotine than I was before, then went back to cigarettes. I've tried patches, vapes, lozenges, Alan Carr's book, and gum, all unsuccessfully. I made it 3 weeks cold turkey, then started bumming them from a friend, then buying tins of dip, and ultimately went back to square one. Over the past week I've been dipping and using snus, thinking it would be sustainable, until an hour ago I bought another pack. I smoked two in disgust, and broke up the rest and flushed them away.

So tonight it begins. I have so many reasons to quit. It screws up my workouts, makes me smell like an ashtray in class, is unattractive, and most of all, will kill me if I don't stop. 

We're all gonna make it. Trust the process.

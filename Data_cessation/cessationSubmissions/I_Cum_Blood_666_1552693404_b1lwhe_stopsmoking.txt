Day 3

Well everybody, I made it to day number three, cold turkey, and I must say I am feeling pretty good. I’ve only had three or four urges today and they weren’t very strong or long lasting at all compared to the last two days. My concentration is improving. I slept fine last night which is a big improvement. I wouldn’t say I’m feeling 100% but I’m getting there.

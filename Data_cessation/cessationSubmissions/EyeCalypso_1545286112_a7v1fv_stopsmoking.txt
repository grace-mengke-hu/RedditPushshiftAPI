Has anyone noticed a difference in their chronic pain since quitting?

I fractured my back a few years ago and it never quite healed right. My pain management doctor told me that 80% of people with chronic pain are smokers. I kinda thought that was just bull crap but I can definitely feel an improvement in regards to my pain!

Has anyone else experienced this kind of relief after quitting?

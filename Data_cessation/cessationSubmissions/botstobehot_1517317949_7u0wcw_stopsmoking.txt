My suggestion: do not take chantix/champix and if you do avoid alcohol 100%

Hey everyone. I quit taking champix because it made me feel like I was in a haze of depression and psychosis. I stopped taking it and the next day was drinking with my girlfriend, I blacked out after a few drinks and after 20 minutes came back to my senses. I asked my girlfriend why we were outside the house and she said I got angry that she touched me, and I wanted to go outside to get some air. I had no idea about what happened for those 20 minutes and when she told me I broke down thinking I completely lost it. 

When I was taking those pills I didn’t feel myself. I had no energy to exercise and the only good thing I had going for me was that I stopped smoking. I have no history of mental illness and I’m usually a happy guy - which I am now after the champix chemical is out of my system. I only took it for 10 days and it gradually got worse and worse. All I could do was sleep all day, I haven’t smoke after taking it and have no desire to because I don’t want to go through anything like that again.

Do not drink if you are taking it, you shouldn’t need my advice, but don’t think about it. I have never blacked out after 3 drinks and thought that I was completely crazy before.

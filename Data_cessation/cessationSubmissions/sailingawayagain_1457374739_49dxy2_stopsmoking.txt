One year nicotine free thanks to this sub!

I had been a pack a day smoker for eighteen years.  It had a death grip on me until, like many of you, I decided that I had enough of surrendering my life for an addiction. 

Thanks largely to this sub, I have done what I would have once thought was impossible.  One year free. Our shared experiences helped a lot during my quit.

Thanks to all of you who shared your success stories.  Your success inspired.

Thanks to all of you that posted tales of failure, your stumbles acted as a warning.  

Please, keep posting.  If not for yourself than for someone else.  To everyone still struggling, it gets so much better.  Hang in there!

Cannot Focus, Considering an E-Cig

I have been revising a 1-page summary of a short article for the past 4-5 hours. I have no idea how much longer it will take me because I keep deleting and retyping paragraphs, then revising them, then deleting them again. I quit smoking about two weeks ago when I was prescribed bupropion (wellbutrin), which I stopped taking a few days ago because it was causing memory and anger problems. I have been rereading and rearranging sentences and replacing words needlessly (maybe?), not knowing if any of it makes sense, certain that it's repetitive, though unable to figure out why. I have to remind myself what the words mean, and keep getting confused. To make things worse there's a horsefly in the room. Anyway, I have not been this detached, ill-focused in a long time and have convinced myself that nicotine will help me concentrate because it always does. I bought a reuseable e-cig shortly before my most recent cigarette, and I am highly tempted to use it. This assignment is imperative to finish tonight, as I have work during a nice cut of sunlight tomorrow, and it's due for submission Monday (yes, Labor Day, but online submission, nonetheless). I'm losing my mind. Has anyone else had the focus issue/how did you deal with it?

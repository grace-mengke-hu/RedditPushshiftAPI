Looking to quit. Any advice please?

Met a girl who I have fallen for. We were laying in bed last night listening to this old guy cough for like 20 min straight. She looked at me and said at least I don't smoke. That kind of struck a cord inside. I'm also a member of the search and rescue team in northwest montana. I can see a huge decrease in my performance when I am needed. Going to go smoke my last one right now. Any advice for a guy? Please!

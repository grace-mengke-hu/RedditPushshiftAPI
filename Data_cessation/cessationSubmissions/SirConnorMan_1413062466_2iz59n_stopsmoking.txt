Well I never thought I could do it, here's to 222 days.

I just wanted to give a warm thank you to everyone who posts, comments, and even lurks here. You are what makes this community so great. This sub is what finally got me to wake up one morning and say enough is enough and for that I'm truly grateful. So here's to you /r/stopsmoking !

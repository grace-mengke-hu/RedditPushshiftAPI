trying to stop for the first time

hey guys, been wanting to stop for a while now but never really tried. decided this is my last pack, but I'm super worried about the cravings and negative effects it has for the weeks after you stop.         
           
I get really anxious and spacey at times, feeling like my heart is going to stop or I'm going to faint and I have this idea that all those feelings will be magnified by 10 in the weeks following me quitting, and it doesn't help that i'm living abroad by myself and that adds to the worry I feel.         
           
just looking for some advice, normally smoke 10 a day at the moment, and was hoping you could offer some tips or products that might help me kick this stupid habit. thanks.

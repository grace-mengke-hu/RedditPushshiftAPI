Dipping tobacco for 7 years, i have "quit" multiple times. Its time for a change.

I know this is a subreddit for quitting smoking but dipping is just as bad as far as addiction goes. I have made multiple attempts to try and quit over the last few years but i want this to end now. My gums are receding pretty badly and its getting to that point where i know that if i keep this up, im going to start losing teeth. The punch to the face is that i just bought about $35 worth of tobacco yesterday and i told myself that i would just chew a few more cans then quit blah blah blah, not gonna happen. Im going to quit FOREVER starting today.

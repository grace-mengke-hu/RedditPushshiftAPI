Smoke Free

Hi Buddies,

I completed 300 days reading your posts which kept me motivated and smoke free.

Just want to say one thing to people who recently joined that You will find every kind of motivation here but if you are hell serious to be smoke free just visit reddit app 5 times a day which will automatically give your sub conscious mind reasons to keep going.

ONE MONTH SMOKE FREE

I used to smoke 8-10 sticks a day. Then I had to trim it down to 2 due to the nature of my work, except for days off. I was a smoker for 12 years. “Was”, FINALLY, and have been smoke free for a month. By jove! This is one of the best decisions I have made in my life. 
How did I do it? I laid down all the pros and cons (a habit of mine). 

Pros
1. It creates dopamine, a chemical transmitted to your brain, that once you puff a cigar, it’s like Viola! It makes you feel good! Well, there are many non-smoking activities you can enjoy that may cause your brain to release dopamine, one of our mood-boosting brain. And cigarette smoking is just a short cut.
2. It reduces irritability, stress and anxiety. For those who are smokers, you can testify on this, back me up dudes!
3. If you’re hungry as f%#!, take a puff. Yes, it does eliminate your appetite. 

Cons

1. You’re burning your money, figuratively. 
2. Cigarette, if unlit, it smells good. But once you light it up, the smell lingers everywhere. And the aftermath, you smell like no one wanted to get close to you (stinky clothes, bad breath, arrgh). Real story.
3. IT DOES NOT DO ANY GOOD TO YOUR HEALTH. I won’t list down the illnesses it may bring to you, you’ll get bored until you realize there’s so MANY and this time you may puff your last stick or hesitate to try your first.
4. Lastly, think about your loved ones and the people who care about you. Don’t let them down and don’t drag them down to the pit of your ashes, a metaphor.

Anyone trying or tried the juul?

Im ready to quit vaping but i feel pulled to the juul. Ive never had before but the thought of no leaks and better flavour intices me. Im currently using the very similar myblu and its good enough to not smoke. Much better actually. Just wondered if the juul is something to be excited about or end my time vaping without ever having it. I feel like i need to try it.

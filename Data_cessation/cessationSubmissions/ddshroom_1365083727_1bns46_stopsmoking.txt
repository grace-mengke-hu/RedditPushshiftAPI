I just thought I should share this. How to be strong in this, and everything you do. I love this place!

HOW TO DO IT FROM MY POINT OF VIEW.

I have lost 100 hundred pounds recently  I use http://www.myfitnesspal.com/.  it asks you to write down everything you eat. When you do that you become mindful.  it actually strengthens your mind. So you might start writing down your feelings and thoughts.  Probe your mind.  Probe your sensations. Find your power and then deepen it.  Then deepen it again. I also use nlp  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming.  It teaches you to be powerful.  It teaches you to conquer your will. What you are doing is difficult.  Your success will carry over into every aspect of your life. And THERE IS NO FAILURE. If you slip just dust yourself off and start again. Be strong.  Conquer your will, than take that into your life, your job, your studies, everything you do.  Be Strong.  Rock On!!

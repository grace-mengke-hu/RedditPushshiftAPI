Holy Cow! A whole year!

I did it!  I did what the me of a year ago thought would be impossible!  

I'm a long time lurker on this sub, poking my head out every once in a while to offer words of encouragement to those on the path.  It's been the posts of others going through this with me that made it possible, even if I was just silently sitting in the shadowy corner, though.  Thank you all so much for sharing your battle stories!

A year in and I do still occasionally get cravings, but they are NOTHING like they used to be, and all it takes is a single moment to remember how awful cigarettes used to make me feel to get past it.  

In this year I've begun going to the gym 3-4 days a week, 1-2 hours per session.  The me that smoked would go maybe 1 time every 3 or 4 months, and only last 20 minutes.  

Non-smoking me puts in a minimum of 12k steps a day (alright, I've been slacking on that one for the past couple weeks, but -30 windchills just aren't worth walking in).  Smoking me would maybe put in 5k steps a day.

I just FEEL so much better than I ever did while smoking, and upon looking back I cannot believe I wasted 16 years of my life with that habit.  To those who are just starting the battle, it is tough, but it is doable.  I went cold turkey, but if that's not for you do not be afraid of using NRT. Just keep on keeping on, and don't look back.  I remember how much I used to lie to myself that smoking helped me relax, helped relieve stress.. It's all bullshit, plain and simple.  It helps you *ignore* stress for the duration of the cigarette, but as soon as that smoke is done, the stressor is still there, plus an extra stressor of an addiction to feed.  So just keep at it, it gets so much better. 

Thanks for reading my ramble if you made it this far, and thanks everybody for being here to help me, and everybody else, quit the shit and start living better.

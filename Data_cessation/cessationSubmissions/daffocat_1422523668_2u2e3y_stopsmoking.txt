" I don't smoke"!

I just wanted to share something. The other day as I was walking into work, I was asked if I had a light for a persons cigarette. I almost burst with pride when I said " I don't smoke" and I walked off grinning (I think he thought I was a bit mad). I haven't stopped thinking about it or smiling about it since. I never thought that I would actually be a non smoker. I am so proud of myself. For everyone who is struggling in the early days, it honestly does get better.

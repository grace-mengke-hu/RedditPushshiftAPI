I am extremely anxious.

Hello my fellow quitters!

I have successfully repainted my nails, made something to eat, and knit about 10 rows in my scarf. Just so you know, it is 96 degrees outside and I definitely do not need a scarf; I also do not need a cigarette.

The other day I had a brand new pack of smokes. So *"fresh"* smelling and new. I ended up ripping ALL of them in half and throwing them in the garbage. I also scoured my house searching for all of the butts and threw them away as well. I've been smoking since I was 16 and am now 22. Enough is enough.

To ensure that I did not try and go through the garbage later (seriously, if that isn't addiction, I don't know what is!) I poured some water into the garbage, tied it up, and then threw it in the dumpster. It has been a few days but I can feel my self getting anxious! 

Tl;dr - Jhdsjkhakhd sbJ!!dnk!

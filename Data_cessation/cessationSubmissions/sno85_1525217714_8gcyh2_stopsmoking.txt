First Time Around a Smoker Since Quitting

Tonight I had dinner with my dad, a smoker. Afterwards, we were out in his garden and he lit up. For about 15 seconds, I had a maaaajor craving. Then he walked closer to me and the smell was just overwhelming and awful, which pretty much killed my craving. It was the first moment I felt like a non-smoker rather than a person who is just trying not to smoke, if that makes any sense. Ended up being a much better day than I anticipated! :)

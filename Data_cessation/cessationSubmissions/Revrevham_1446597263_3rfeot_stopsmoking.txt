I was told there'd be cravings.

I am 41 hours into quitting smoking. I am quitting because I was diagnosed with a chronic illness. I'm not using gum or anything. I smoked a pack a day for 13 years.

I read up about withdrawal and how you must distract yourself during cravings, which last about 5 minutes. 

Instead of cravings, I have a long continuous desire for a cigarette. It doesn't go away. The only time I stopped thinking about it today was when I had buffalo wings for dinner. 

Am I broken?

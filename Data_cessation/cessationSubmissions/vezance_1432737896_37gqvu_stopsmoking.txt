Did I just get through the hardest day?

I heard one of you say the 3rd day is the hardest. Is that true? 

The urges didn't seem stronger at all today, although I ended up almost rationalizing a smoke by telling myself I had gotten through two days and one cigarette couldn't hurt. Now I am safely home (I never smoke once I am back home) and will face my fourth day tomorrow.

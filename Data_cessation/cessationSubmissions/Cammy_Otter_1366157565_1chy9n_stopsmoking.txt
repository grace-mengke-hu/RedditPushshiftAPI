Day 3 of not smoking. Feel like crap, but I'm truckin' on!

My future roommates kind of had a heart-to-heart with me last week and told me that I couldn't live with them next year if I kept smoking. Couple that with the fact that I'm a poor college student and I figured it was high time I quit smoking. I smoked my last cigarette at 4:35 PM on Saturday. Didn't even finish it because I was so anxious to just quit. Starting this morning, I've begin feeling symptoms of a cold like runny nose, bad cough, mild congestion, but I figured this could very well just be allergies from living in a new area. I can't really afford any patches or lozenges or anything like that, so I'm depending a lot on my friends to help me get through these next few weeks.

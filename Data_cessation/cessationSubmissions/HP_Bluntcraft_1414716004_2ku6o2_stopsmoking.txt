Going out for my last cigarette

I've been trying to quit since I realized that I was addicted. It's been about four years, I smoke half a pack to a full pack a day.

I'm really serious about quitting now, I want to feel healthier and have no where near the money I need to keep smoking. So, I'm going to out to smoke my last cigarette once I finish this post.

I'm planning on going mostly cold turkey, but I have some nicotine gum in case I get really bad cravings. Wish me luck?

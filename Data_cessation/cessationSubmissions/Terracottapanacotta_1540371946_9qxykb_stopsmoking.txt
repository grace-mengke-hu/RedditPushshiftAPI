One month 12 days smoke free.. and just found out I’m pregnant.

So happy to say at 2 days off 6 weeks quit and I’ve just found out I’m 4 1/2 weeks pregnant. It feels so nice to know that I will have not smoked at all during my pregnancy and at 6 weeks quit my cravings are next to none and I hardly think about smoking anymore. Now I have to perfect excuse to keep going and quit for life.

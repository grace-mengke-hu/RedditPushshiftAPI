Tomorrow Sunday, August 18th 2019 will be my quit date

This is far from my first attempt but I know its time to change. I’m going to keep posting here daily. I’ve been vaping but the addition makes me pick up cigarettes when available without hesitation. I made it a month recently and “rewarded” myself with one but its never just one. Its infinite or none. I know that now. It cannot be controlled or negotiated with myself. If I compromise once, I will always be compromised. I think knowing that will enable me to make it this time. I wish all of you the best as I join you in a movement for a better future.

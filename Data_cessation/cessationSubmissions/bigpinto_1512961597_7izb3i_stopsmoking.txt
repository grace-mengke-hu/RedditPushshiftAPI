Still not smoking

For some reason my cravings are stronger these days although less frequent, but I am still not smoking.

But thats not the least of my problems. My dad's SSI got cancelled, so now I have to pay his rent, my boss has set up a meeting with HR tomorrow for my "performance issues" so most likely I am getting fired (if not tomorrow then in three months tops) my ex-wife is giving me a headache again over child custody, and the court has ordered child custody evaluation that will probably cost a couple of thousands more.

Still not smoking yet though.

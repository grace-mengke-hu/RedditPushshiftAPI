What is the point in quitting smoking when it makes me content?

I thought you should do what makes you happy in life?

I smoke cigarettes to enjoy myself throughout the day and to do some thinking, but everyone I'm around always fucking looks down on me when I'm smoking!!!!!!!! 

I've been smoking from age 21 to 29 now and I have no problems...My teeth and skin are fine and so is my health.

Ya, I might smell like an ash tray and people I see might look down on me...But smoking makes me happy and gives me peace and something to constantly do throughout the day and I need that as my mind races all day long.

I'm in day 9 Today and honestly I don't see anything positive about it besides not coughing at much and not smelling like ash tray, but those 2 things never bothered me all that much.

For the last 9 days I've felt like shit, constantly wanting to smoke and not being able to is making me angry and frustrated, yet if I was smoking those 9 days...Life would be normal and A-OK.

Oh, and I got people telling me congrats, keep up the good work, but for what? I'm not happy when I'm not smoking and don't think I ever will be....

So ya,....what is the point in all of this???

I quit on Monday morning...not sure how I feel.

I had smoked before (from 17yo-20yo) but not even a half a pack a day. I quit for a girl I was dating (drugs and smoking) which sucked a first but I had a motive and a cheerleader. However I started back up a year ago. First it was just a few cigs throughout the day but I got to the point of smoking 15-25 handrolled cigs a day. I tried quitting 3 times in this past year but every time I have caved within the first 48hrs. Make matters worse I am living in a country where smoking is basically 2nd nature to people. Hell I see moms with toddlers in one hand and a cig in the other. 

Something feels different this time...I didn't have the urge to quit I just ran out of tobacco, filters and papers at the same time and took it as a sign. That being said I am sitting in bed right now knowing that a cig would be awful for me but feel pretty nice. I don't know if its apathy or ambivalence but I don't feel particularly motivated in either direction (quitting or starting again). Anyone else had this?

Thanks for reading all that if you did. I know many of you smoked harder and for longer than I did so don't mind me. 

TLDR: Quit for the 4th time in a year, this time feels different because of my indifference to quitting or relapsing.

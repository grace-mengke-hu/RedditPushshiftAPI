I’ve cut down by half. It’s not much but I’m proud.

I [27F] have been smoking for just on 8 years now. At my worst I was just on a 25 pack a day, but mostly hovering around 20 cigarettes a day. 

Over the past 3 weeks, I’ve only had 2 days where I’ve had more than 10 cigarettes- and they were both 11 because I was drinking and miscounted. Some days I’ve made it 9 

It doesn’t sound like a huge triumph, but to me it is everything. Cutting down by half because I WANTED to. The first few days sucked, but it’s getting easier.

I don’t think I’m ready to go cold turkey just yet, but this is the first step and I’m managing OK. 

I’m just proud of my progress and wanted to share.

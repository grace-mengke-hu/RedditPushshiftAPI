Here we go, again. I really want to quit for good.

I have been trying to quit on and off now for a few months and I'm fed up with it. I gave up this morning and have decided to make this quitting experience as positive and enjoyable as possible.

The amount of times I came up with excuses to smoke again is just ridiculous. It's amazing what the addiction has us telling ourselves.

Cross your fingers for me, folks. I'm excited to utilize this community and search for more tips and stories.

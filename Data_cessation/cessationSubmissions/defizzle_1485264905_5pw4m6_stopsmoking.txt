My mind is playing tricks on me.

I keep thinking: 'Ah come on, one won't hurt.' 'You know now you can easily quit again.' Don't you remember how good it tasted?' 

Even though I know it tastes horrible, I hadn't even enjoyed it the last few days I smoked, and I know quitting after a relapse is harder.

I'm not smoking, I will not smoke, I will never smoke again, I am a non-smoker!

I have almost a full pack in my car... I've been wanting to quit for the past year... Can't throw them away, and I can't stop.

But I am going to throw them away, and I am going to stop. I have had one today, so I guess tomorrow will be my official day one. Here is to hoping I can be as strong as I feel right now for the rest of my life.

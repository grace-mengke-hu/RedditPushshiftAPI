After 22 years, I think I've finally done it.

After 22 years, I think this is finally the time that I'll manage to quit smoking for good. I've quit so many times and have always gone back. Even though my boyfriend is allergic to cigarette smoke, I still went back. What scared me into quitting is that my sister was diagnosed with emphysema, the start of copd, and she has nodules on her lungs that might be cancer. She still has more tests to do but it has effectively scared me. I don't even want to be in the same room with a smoker. When I had a scan done (sorry, I forget what kind) the doctor found that I had a calcified spot on my left lung but was otherwise ok. Still, every time I go to work, I have to fight cravings. Every time I leave the apartment to go anywhere, I get cravings. I'm trying music and gum and god I hope that and fear works.

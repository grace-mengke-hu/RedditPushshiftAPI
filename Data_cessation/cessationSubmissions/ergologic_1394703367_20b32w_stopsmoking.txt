I need some help.

Guys, I need your help. 

I've been trying to quit for over a year now and I never succeed. I manage to refrain from smoking whenever I'm with other people or when I'm away for a week. Sometimes even two weeks at a time. But every time I come back and have a quiet evening to myself, that demon thought "hey... you know... why NOT?" is there and I can't resist.

I don't really experience any physical withdrawal problems. Probably because this last year of quitting made me smoke a lot less compared to when I was still studying. 

So the main problem I've got right now is psychological. It's the moments when I am able to relax or work on some projects alone in the evening. Those are huge triggers for me.

See, right now it's morning and I'm at my dayjob and I'm completely convinced that I do NOT want to have a smoke tonight because I know it makes me feel like shit and drains all my energy. 

But I know, from last year's experience, that I will have a really convincing urge to smoke tonight. And I don't want to give in again.

I'm turning to you guys to help me this time. I've had enough. I've tried everything from nicotine gum to self help books like Alan Carr's. Nothing has worked - although the book did convince me that I really don't enjoy smoking and that I want to stop doing so once and for all. 

I know not smoking makes me feel a lot better. I'm healthier and I'm happier. Even after a week already. But every time, I've given in to the urge. 

So there. I requested a badge and I'll be coming back to this sub every time I feel like I'm losing control. 

Thanks in advance for your support. This sub is amazing and I hope it can help me.

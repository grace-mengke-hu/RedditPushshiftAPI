Quit update

Hey everyone! First and foremost I have to thank you all. Every single time I’ve felt like slipping I’ve come here and reading has pulled me through. 

I wanted to give an update, even though I am aware most of you aren’t sitting around wondering how it’s been for me, lol. 

The longest I’ve ever gone without smoking is 3 months. I am inching closer and closer to that every day! 

My biggest trigger is drinking and I have mostly overcome that by facing it head on. However my husband has continued to smoke while drinking. The thing I’m most proud of is that I had a revelation after getting (once again) angry with him for smoking when we were both out drinking and he had one. I spent my morning after walking and thinking about why it made me angry and realized that it was pointless and a waste of energy. Yes, it sucks that he pushed me to quit and didn’t do it himself. But this is MY quit. Not his. And people getting pissed at me for smoking never helped me stop by drove me to hide it and/or smoke more. He’s in that place where he believes that because he only does it when he drinks he’s “not addicted” which is laughable to me. And I did tell him that his addiction was probably worse than my pack and a half per day because he a) puts more value on each of his cigs and b) is more delusional about his addiction (ie believes he’s not addicted).   I digress. But I realized that it was pointless to expend energy being mad that I want to smoke and won’t when he continues to. I’m not going to. Period. I just need to get over it. And that is why I know this time is different. 


I’m still on guard about the place I’m in, making sure I don’t get too over confident and slip, but I feel really really good right now. 

Thanks for reading, sorry for it being a rather rambling read, and again for all the support. I’m thankful for you all!

Haven't smoked in almost a month, is it strange that I still haven't thrown out my last pack and lighter?

It's not the first time I tried quitting and this time I did it on a whim without choosing a specific day or anything, I just did it. But I've had a half-empty pack with a lighter tucked away in my sock drawer since then. I somewhat want to throw it out but even thinking about it makes me anxious, I guess I just want to have that feeling of it being right there. The thing is that I'm not sure if keeping it will help me quit or help me relapse. Any comments or advice would be appreciated!

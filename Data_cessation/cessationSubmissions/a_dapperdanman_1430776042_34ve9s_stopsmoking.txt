Urges are strong today.

I'm not sure why but all day today I've been having the worse nicotine fits. It might have to do with the whiskey. I'm thankfully strong enough to not smoke an actual cigarette, but going to buy an ecig sounds like such a reasonable option. Any advice or just some motivation would help.

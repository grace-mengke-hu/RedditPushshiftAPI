After 11 days of quitting, I picked up a cigarette today.

I quit smoking 11 days back, after around 6 years of being a pack-a-day smoker. The first 10 days were easy, as I was back home, with my parents, and its a peaceful place, where I dont feel stressed, and never have the urge to smoke. But I returened today morning. And I saw my flatmate's cigarette box on the drawer. I felt something calling me towards it. I picked it up. Put the filter to my lips. Brought up the lighter.

And stopped.

I am an addict, and always will be. One puff will never be enough.

But, I'll get by with a little help from my friends.

Stay strong friends. Dont give up. Dont give in.

Quit smoking.

Stay Strong.

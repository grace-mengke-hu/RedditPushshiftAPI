Two Weeks

Sigh, here is (another) confession.

About two weeks ago, I quit. I was doing really well until about 5 days in, when my coworker said that she was going to quit and ended up caving.

I smoked a lot last night- probably 4-5 when drinking. In general I have been drinking *a lot* more since I quit.

This morning I experienced a sort of nicotine headache.

I have but one consolation : i have not bought a pack in something like two weeks!!! 

It's definitely an ongoing struggle!!! The thing that's keeping me together is that I am accountable to my roommate, who is also quitting at this same time. 

I also like to give myself a bit of leniency - i was smoking half a pack a day since the age of 19 (I am now 27). 

That said: every time i have a night of smoking, I have to start from the beginning. Cravings come back stronger, increasing the likelihood that I might by a pack again if shit hits the fan. So really, my quit method is not working in my favor, and it's more a pain in the ass than anything at this point to start and stop repeatedly.

Suggestions/Feedback welcome!! Thanks!

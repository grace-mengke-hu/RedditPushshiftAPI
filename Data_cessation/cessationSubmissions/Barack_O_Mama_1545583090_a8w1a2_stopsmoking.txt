Does anyone else feel like a shittier person without nicotine?

I quit cigarettes about 3 years ago actually but used a vape extremely heavily from then until about 4 weeks ago. Now I’m totally nicotine free but I almost feel like it isn’t even worth it.

At first I had really intense cravings and mood swings. Now I’m not really having mood swings but I feel like I’m constantly in a pretty bad mood and still craving nicotine all the time.

Before I quit I felt like I was a pretty happy and warm person. I was always smiling and laughing, making a lot of jokes all the time and enjoying myself. Now I feel like I’m cold and short with people unintentionally. If I catch myself, I do my best to be really nice to people, etc., but I feel like I have to “fake it” now, compared to before where it just came naturally.  

I’m a pretty intense person but nicotine helped me relax and chill out, now I feel like I’m on edge all the time. I’ve tried meditating, deep breathing, listening to relaxing music... none of it seems to work so far. Running makes me feel better while I’m on my run and for like 30 minutes after but then I fall right back into a shitty mindset.

It does feel good to type this out and vent a bit, because I don’t really have anyone in my life who will *listen* to me about stuff like this. I used nicotine since age 15 and I’m 23 now, I feel like since I used it so much as my brain was developing it could be really ingrained into me in a weird way. 

Anyone else feel like they aren’t themselves anymore after quitting nicotine? Or maybe you are a shittier version of yourself now?

Today is my quit day

Been trying to get myself to do this for a while and today is the day. I smoke about 3 or 4 a day. More if I've taken my adderall. I'm trying cold turkey but I'm open to NRT if it gets too bad. Just said no to my post breakfast cig break though and it felt really great! I just hope my attitude about quitting holds up. 

Any tips for cold turkey quitters?

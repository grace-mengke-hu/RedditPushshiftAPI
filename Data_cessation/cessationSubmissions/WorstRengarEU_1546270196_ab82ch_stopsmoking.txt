Well, this is harder than I thought.

NY eve in 9 hours. 

I am alone at my place which is probably how I am going to spend the rest of today. Family in another country. Friends are occupied with their relatives. That's what I got for being career-focused past two years. Fuck it.

Downed a couple of whiskey glasses and its so hard not to binge. The only thing that keeps me from running into the last open store for a pack of cigs is me knowing that it will only make me feel shittier. Also I don't want to reset that 2 week counter on my phone.

Stay strong ya'll, it'll get fucking better, I know it. 

Also, Happy New Year ya'll!

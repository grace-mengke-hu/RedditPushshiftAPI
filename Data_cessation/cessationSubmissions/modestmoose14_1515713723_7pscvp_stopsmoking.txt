Vision Issues After Quitting Dip

I quit dip 7 days ago and I am currently experiencing some disconcerting side effects in relation to my eyes. I am seeing double, which is especially apparent when I am driving. I cannot read street signs and I have difficulty seeing where I am in the road. I was wondering if this is an issue anyone else has experienced because I'm really starting to freak out.

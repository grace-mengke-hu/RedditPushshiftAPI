1 week - How is it going?

The Frist few days were not so easy but now its getting better. I'm still anti social and get angry at times but I like being alone. I noticed that I have more energy and my heart rate went down which gives me motivation to do more cardio. My app says I saved about 35 Euros so that's nice too.

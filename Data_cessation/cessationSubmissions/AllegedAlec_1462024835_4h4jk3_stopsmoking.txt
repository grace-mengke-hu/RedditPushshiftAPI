[Rant] What I miss

Some background on me: 24, been smoking for the best part of 6 years by now, with three serious (3+ months) quitting attempts (and several other ones which fell short after a few weeks). I've been doing another one lately because I was coughing my lungs out for over two weeks after having a slight cold, which scared the hell out of me. I've been clean for a week or so by now. Been doing pretty fine so far; been through this rodeo enough times to be able to deal with most of the symptoms pretty well. However, I still miss the shit out of a few things:

* I miss how cigarettes divided my day up into nice 2-2.5 hour parts. I don't know why, but my days just felt more structured in general.
* I miss how after a really shitty DOTA game, I was able to take 5 minutes to unwind and come back calm and collected.
* When watching or reading something heady or heavy, I miss being able to take a cigarette break to think about what I just read/watched.
* I miss being able to take a cigarette break when a friend or relative was being a complete ass, and allow myself to not get too wound up and to not get involved.
* When I'm done in the gym, I usually feel like shit. I miss the cigarette I had when leaving the gym, which usually carried me through that period.
* I miss how, when I was stressed out by a large increase in workload, a cigarette break helped me to put everything in perspective and make a planning.
* I miss the faint smell of smoke and tobacco on the sleeve of my jacket.
* I miss the sight from the balcony of the lab I work, at a day's end, with a cigarette and a beer.
* I miss the combination of the taste of coffee and the smell of a cigarette during my break.
* I miss having something to do while waiting for a bus or train.


Sorry to be ranting like this in my first post in this subreddit. It's not been a good day for me.

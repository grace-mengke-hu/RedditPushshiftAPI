My birthday present to myself is my freedom.

I turned 24 on Saturday and I decided about a month ago that I would quit smoking the day after my birthday. I am in Zagreb, Croatia right now in the middle of a backpacking journey. Alcohol and cigarettes everywhere, every day. If I can make it to Istanbul without a puff of tobacco, I can make it the rest of my life. So far, so good.  

For some reason it feels easier this time. I've said my goodbyes, I've had my fun, I've just decided that addiction can't be a part of my life anymore. More than anything else, I want to be that person who can say they haven't touched a cigarette since the day they quit.

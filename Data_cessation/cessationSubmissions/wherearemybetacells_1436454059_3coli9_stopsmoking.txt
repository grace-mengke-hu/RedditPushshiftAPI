2 weeks - thanks guys!

So it's been 2 weeks and about 13 hours since I smoked or vaped! It's not that long, I know, but this is the longest I've gone without nicotine in 7 years and I know without a doubt I'll never do it again. 

It's definitely a lot easier now than it was at the start, although I still have cravings every so often when I'm exposed to certain triggers but I wasn't exactly expecting them to go away so soon. My mood is also better, the restlessness and moodiness I talked about in a previous post has seemed to go away and I'm quite happy and calm. 

Although I haven't posted much it's nice to read other posts and know I'm not the only one going through this, so thanks guys :) 

EDIT: forgot to mention that the extreme hunger I was experiencing has calmed down a lot, the past 3 days my appetite is back to normal thankfully! :)

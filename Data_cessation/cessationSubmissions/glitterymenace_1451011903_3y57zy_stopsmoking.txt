Flubbed up!

Hey Reddit!  I've passed the two week mark, and have actually been feeling great!  I have been sweating so, so much in yoga, haha!  I'm visiting my parents in my childhood home, and have been feeling a little bit stressed, as I usually do this time of year.  Two nights ago, I hung out with some old friends.  Out of the 10 people present, I was the ONLY ONE not smoking.  And, the weird thing is, I couldn't stop bringing it up.  I clearly had cigs on the mind.  We were chilling in this guy's garage, and I felt like I was 15 again...when I tried my first cigarette.  Later, we went out for drinks, and I caved.  I bummed some from a friend.  I sucked down three in a row!  I was not pleased with the taste, but the nicotine felt like the kiss of an angel.  I haven't had one since, but I'm seeking the positive lesson from the relapse.  Alcohol and nostalgia seem to be my biggest contributing factors to lighting up.  As the holidays continue to roll onward, I hope to use this knowledge to my advantage!  Happy holidays, Reddit.

Today is officially one year!

I did it cold turkey. 

I remember I quit on Friday, but relapsed on Saturday and bought a pack. I was so upset with myself because I had already broken my promise. So I did something I'd never done before to prove my resolve.
Saturday night, after the clouds had drifted away leaving puddles in their wake, I poured out the remaining cigarettes onto the ground and watched them saturate with water. As many of you know, that's the most powerful thing an addict can do- permanently destroy their substance of choice. 

The following Sunday was simultaneously the best and worst of my life, fraught with anxiety and withdrawals but held together with stubborn pride. 

That was the day I knew I would not fail again. I would not waste money on a pack again. I would not take a drag while drunk at a bar again. I would not bum a cig off of some stranger on the street again. 

Those sodden cigarettes have carried me through this year. After the first three months (which I admit, were physically and emotionally difficult and tested my willpower on numerous occasions) I knew I was over the addiction. I was free. 

This subreddit has helped tremendously, and though I didn't post often, reading all your stories of your struggles and triumphs helped me make it as far as I did. I hope I can do the same for someone else. 

I wish you all you wish yourself~

I feel like I quit every 2 weeks, just to break a week later.

They keep saying 3 days is the hump, but 3 days is nothing for me. I consistently go 3 days over a weekend, but when I go back to school or work, I want one again so badly. Seems like I have a hump at 6 days instead.

Anyway, I'm at 2 days, with friday, saturday, sunday looking good. Here's hoping I can stick to my guns this time.

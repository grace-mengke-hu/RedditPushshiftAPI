Holy shit cigarettes are fucking gross.

As you can see by my flair, I am 177 days into my quit. I am kinda drunk and lost my inhibition and gave in to my idiotic thought that a smoke would be pleasant. Fuck you, it's not. I tried one and god damn it was gross. Now I stink and my breath is horrible. *I only had 2 drags!!!!!*.

My quit date was very matter of factly 177 days ago. I have NOT touched tobacco in that time. I smoked for 15 years and stopped cold turkey after/whilst reading "The Easy Way" (hint: it fucking works), so this little foray back into nasty land of smoking was a legit shock.

Stop smoking, you guys. You can do it. I did. If I can, all of you can. I promise.

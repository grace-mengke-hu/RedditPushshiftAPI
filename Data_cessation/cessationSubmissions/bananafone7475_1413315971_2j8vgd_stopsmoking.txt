Finally free, but need some advice.

So I've just finished Allen Carr's book. I'm on day 3 and feeling good. This is probably the 10th time I've tried quitting, I always falter when I drink. The weekend's coming up and I know I'll be getting nice and drunk, and the 'smoking only when I drink' thing is not an option. Any advice to resist the urges while drinking? Thanks!

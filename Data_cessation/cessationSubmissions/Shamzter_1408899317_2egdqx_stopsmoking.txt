Long time lurker, serial relapse-er?

I have given up before, back in 2009 for a good one and a half years. Circumstances changed, relationships changed, relocation to hometown - back to square one. 

After that, I have tried giving up multiple times, and I would succeed for a few months but I always fall back. Stress seems to be the main culprit but I would also miss smoking and just one day I end up smoking again. And everytime I start smoking I gain some weight, stay at that weight level for a while, quit again, relapse - this cycle has been going on for 3 years now. 

I want to quit for good, I really do. But I just dont know if I am strong enough mentally. I know I should quit, I know my lungs will feel better. I know I could swim faster, run longer if I do. I know quitting might trigger my lost passion for working out - but I simply cant seem to do it. 

I am not desperate, but I am quite depressed at my inability to control my emotions & urges. I dont want to be this weak person, I want to overcome this situation, but I cant find any source of inner motivation anymore.. 

I have two cigarettes left guys, I want these two to be my last. What can I do? Please, help me see straight.

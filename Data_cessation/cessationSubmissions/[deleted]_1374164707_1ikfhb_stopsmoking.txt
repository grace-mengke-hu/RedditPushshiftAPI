First drink since quitting... No cravings!

I think I can officially say it..  I'm a non-smoker!  I decided to test myself by having a few beers and see how my cravings were, and they were non-existant!

My advice to those who are struggling to quit is to not drink alcohol for at least a few weeks after you quit smoking.  Drinking is probably how 80% of us started smoking.  So the trigger to smoke when drinking is typically pretty strong for all of us.  If you remove that trigger from your life until you feel confident in your willpower, you're golden.  Sure, weekends may be boring for a few weeks when you can't go out with your friends and get wasted, but I also found waking up on a sunday morning without a hangover was possibly one of the best trade-offs that I could get in this whole ordeal.

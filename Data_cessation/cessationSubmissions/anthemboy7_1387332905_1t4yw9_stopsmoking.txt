do the cravings ever go away?

I'm just over 3 days.  That's really not very much time, but I haven't slept well in 3 days and I feel like I'm about to peel all my skin off from sheer anxiety and the depression and sweats are in full effect.  Really, I just need to know that one day I'm not going to feel like this anymore.  You don't have to include a time frame since everything I've read on the subject has just made me hate this plan even more.  I could just use a spot of encouragement and reassurance.

Edit: I math bad.

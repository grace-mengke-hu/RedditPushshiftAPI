day 4

today was good. no mayor roadblocks. i had an interesting moment when i went to the shop to buy beer. the guy on the checkout out a pack of marlbro gold on the table when i got to the front. i guess he remembered what i had been smoking recently. said no and bought my beer without incedent. today was a good day

Today was a good day...

...One year today. It was hard for so many months,  but I almost forgot that today was even the anniversary. Anyone who's starting, you have forgotten how life is suppose to be. Remember what you're trying to get back to is normalcy,  not getting away from who you think you are. Those fleeting moments of feelings you got as a smoker will flesh out so much more, and you'll remember how strong feelings can be. I've made it year and I'll never go back. I needed this subs subtle reminders when I browsed my front page, no matter how active I was here. Thanks to all of you, and good luck to all who need it.

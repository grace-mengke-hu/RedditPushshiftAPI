Are you suffering in day 3 like me?

No matter how bad your craving is right now. No matter how much that gnawing urge pangs at your mind and no matter how angry you’re feeling at literally god damn everything right now. All this is *immeasurably* better than the suffering that will be waiting for you in any number of the smoking related illnesses awaiting you, should you continue using tobacco. There is only one direction to go, and that is through the forest until you’re free of this demon. 

Keep fighting. You’re not alone.

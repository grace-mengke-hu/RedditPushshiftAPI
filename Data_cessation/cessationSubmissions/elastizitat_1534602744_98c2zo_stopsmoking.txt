A PSA regarding my experience with Chantix (vericline)

Chantix is a stop-smoking medication that was advetised on TV a lot a while ago, maybe a year or two or three. Feel free to disregard if all this is already well-know information, but I just wanted to issue a small warning...    
So how Chantix works is it has a negative effect when combined with Nicotine. So while you're taking it, any nicotine at all will make you \*sick as death\*. I vomited every time I smelled it, even if I went to put a cig in my mouth I'd gag before I lit it. Which is EXTREMELY useful to quit smoking tbh, there's no greater inhibitor than nausea or disgust.    
Fast forward, Day 4 without a cigarette, and I Lost. My. Goddamn. Mind. I started hearing people arguing and yelling in the other room. At the time I lived with two roommates, so I went out to the living room to see what the ruckus was, they were calmly watching TV. Went back to my room, hear them shouting again, and my brain decides that they're arguing about \*me\*. This all went downhill leading to a really long rant/argument that makes me cringe just to think of it. That was the worst incident, other things happened but I feel that's a pretty solid example.    
The point of this story is to probably look elsewhere for a stop-smoking aid. Other people have reported serious aggression and suicidal thoughts. So yeah. Maybe try the patches

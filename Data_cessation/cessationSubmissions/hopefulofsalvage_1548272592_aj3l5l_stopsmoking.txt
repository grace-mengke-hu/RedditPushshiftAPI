I seriously get motivated by this

Only ~ 15% of people in the UK smoke.

Which means a significant proportion of the population in an entire *country* has given up smoking.

If the entire country can do it, if my father can do it, and if the good hearted people with badges of &gt;1000 days can do it, so can I!

P.s. For those who have quit long, long ago - thank you very much for still being here... I know I need you more than you need me or this grp. I know you are here purely out of the goodness of your hearts. I am inspired by you and it truly helps me to think of this as a doable thing.

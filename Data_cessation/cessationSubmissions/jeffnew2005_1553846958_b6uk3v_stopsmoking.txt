I slipped up

I cannot believe how strong this addiction can be.  After 3 months smoke-free and an unbelievably rough day I broke down and bought a pack of cigarettes.  the only good thing about it was after smoking half a cigarette I realize how bad it actually tasted through the rest of the pack away.

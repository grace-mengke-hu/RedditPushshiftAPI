Worried about the weekend

Hey guys- I quit Sunday evening after an awesome trip where I for sure splurged. I'm doing well so far, feeling mostly fine and not like the cravings are unbearable. I've had my moments but am happy with how things are going.

What I am worried about is this weekend- Aside from my day job I work at a distillery and am a home brewer. I drank coffee this morning without nicotine, but I know alcohol is going to be a new beast. Does anyone else have tips for powering through that? I do have an e-cig that I used periodically before quitting, but I think by then (say day 5 or 6) when the Nicotine is already out of my body, it will be best to stay away completely. 

I suppose an easy answer would be "don't drink" either, but I don't know that I'm ready to and/or want to make 2 massive lifestyle changes like that at once. I find great pleasure in crafting homebrewed recipes and make a decent supplemental income playing music at the distillery. 

Thanks for your tips! It's great to read this sub and see where everyone is in their success!

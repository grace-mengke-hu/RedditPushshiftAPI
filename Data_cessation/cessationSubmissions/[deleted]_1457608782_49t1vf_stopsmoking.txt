First day feeling positive

12 days into this quit. It hasn't been easy - I seem to have a lot of emotion and rage inside me that has been making life miserable for myself and those around me. Until today!
Today I woke up feeling really positive for the first time in ages! I feel like a non-smoker - I had no cravings when I woke up (and no more coughing up slime!) and I felt good! I know that cravings and withdrawal-related mood-swings will probably still happen, but It feels like there is light at the end of the tunnel now. 
So, anyone out there in the throes of hell in those first few days of quitting, take heart. It can get better quicker than you think. 
Let's all keep going!

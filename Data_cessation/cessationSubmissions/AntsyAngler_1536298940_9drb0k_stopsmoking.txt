Smoking 101

I've quit smoking enough times that I feel like I could teach a class about what not to do.  I just logged in and saw that I have hundred and one days! I'm very happy about this.  It's the longest stretch I've had for at least 12 years.  

It's not been easy.  I quit drinking two years ago and quitting smoking has been so much harder for me.  But I'm determined.  I know that I would not have gotten my new job if I was still smoking.  I'm really happy that I don't have to worry about hiding my cigarette addiction any longer.  I'm an ex-smoker!  It's much better, even if I do go a little bit crazy from time to time.  I know eventually that the cravings will fade to a mere memory.  I only get one or two a day now, and they only last for maybe a minute.  Not so bad.

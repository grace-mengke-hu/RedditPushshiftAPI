Day 18 thoughts

I’ve been free of cigarettes for 18 days. I feel really good about it so far, and this time genuinely feels different to every other time before. There’s still that little part of me that is worried that under the right circumstances I might cave in and have one... as much as I don’t feel like it in my day to day life anymore, I can be very impulsive sometimes. But I don’t think I will, because I vowed never to take one more puff ever again. I know that one single puff is enough to get me hooked again. I know that smoking makes me live a life of shame and self-hatred, and I don’t want to be ashamed anymore. I’m sick of letting myself down and beating myself up for it.

Not this time. Not one more puff ever again.

Celebrate every milestone, even when you're just beginning

One year? Congratulate yourself. Ten days? Congratulate yourself. Ten hours? Congratulate yourself.

This is not easy, and the earliest days and weeks are the hardest. Early quitters deserve the most praise and support. There is zero shame in taking a moment to remind yourself how far you've come, even if you're just beginning. This is hard, and others won't encourage you as much as they should. That falls on you.

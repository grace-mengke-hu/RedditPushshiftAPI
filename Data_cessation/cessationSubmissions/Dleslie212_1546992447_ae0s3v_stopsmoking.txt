Last day of smoking

I've been smoking two packs a day for 18 years now. I am going to quit tomorrow morning. My wife quit about a year ago and her and my son have been nagging on me to quit as well. I promised them both I'd try to quit after our vacation, which ends today. I have six cigarettes left in a pack, and then I'm done. I hope.

Quit 4 weeks ago today

I think I posted here last time I quit. I've quit several times in the last 15 (or so) years. This time feels different.

I never wanted to be a smoker. I grew up despising it because I had to constantly deal with second hand smoke. Then, I had a serious relationship with an off-and-on smoker for several years. I eventually caved and started smoking myself. "If you can't beat 'em, join 'em." Let me just say... Fuck. That.

I've always resented her for that, even though I know it was still my choice. I've hated that I still had this stupid, disgusting habit even after our relationship has long been over. I actually ramped up my use after the breakup. Partially to cope, partially because I missed her and it was something we did together. Fuck. That. too.

So now I'm getting back in the driver's seat. I'm tired of all these things that hold power over me. I'm tired of letting shit control me. I've started practicing meditation. It's helped a lot.

It's been four weeks today. Every day I don't smoke I feel a little more empowered; a little more in control. My stress and anxiety is lower. I'm starting to smell things again. Winning this victory everyday is such a boost to my self-esteem. It is a reminder that I am in control of myself and I have the power to change my life for the better.

Cigarettes just can't compete with that.

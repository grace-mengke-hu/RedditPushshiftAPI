Lack of Motivation/Depression

Hey everyone, 

I’m 49 days out which in itself I feel great about! However, for the past week particularly, I’ve noticed a lack of energy/motivation and depression. I am diagnosed with depression and take effexor for it, so its nothing I haven’t dealt with before. I’m just curious if this is normal for it to be from quitting this far since. 

Thanks!

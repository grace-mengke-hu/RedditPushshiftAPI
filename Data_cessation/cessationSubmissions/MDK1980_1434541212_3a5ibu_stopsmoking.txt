So sick of this!

I've smoked for over 20 years - my entire teenage life, and all my adult years so far. I've been a slave to this shit for more than half my life. I've tried using different methods to quit, and all have failed. I have this annoying voice that undermines everything I've worked towards, every time. I've lost days and weeks trying my utmost to quit, and then failing when the whining for nicotine just doesn't stop. The crazy rationlisations why I should just smoke, why now isn't right, why I shouldn't quit before I've gone to my Allen Carr clinic follow up appointment in 3 weeks time (they're the experts, right? they'll set me straight!), why I won't ever be able to do this... It just goes on and on and on... (like this rant?) AND I'M FUCKING SICK OF IT! I don't want this anymore! I'm sick of the smell, feeling like shit everyday, the constant disappointment in myself, having to stand out in the cold to feed my addiction, reading the posts of successful ex-smokers here, posting my own posts like I've achieved something then falling off the wagon hours later, feeling like I've lied to myself so many times because I've said "this was the one!" and then scampered down the road to buy more of the filth because I just couldn't hack it! Then the absolute shame when I light the fucking cigarette, and the pang has gone before I even take the first drag! ENOUGH! I'm done with this shit! FOREVER! As of right NOW! >:(

What have you replaced smoking with?

Last time I quit I replaced it with drinking more... not a good idea! 

This time I've replaced it with stretching, blitz chess and in high stress times rolling up a receipt and focusing on my breathing.. much more healthy.

I was wondering what other people's quirks of quitting are.

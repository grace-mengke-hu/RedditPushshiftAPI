In 43 days, today has been the worst.

After smoking pretty much a pack a day since 1995 or so, I decided to stop smoking the day before my wisdom teeth were to come out. I bought nicotine patches and took the time to let my mind accept that I was making this decision and that there would be bad days.. 

Well.. All was going great, I was using the patches and wasn't experiencing any real issues, I even managed to break the habit and not snack on everything in site due to complications in you oral surgery making it impossible to open my mouth.. Even going back to work where I smoked constantly was really not too bad. 

Today Though.. I went down to the step 2 patches, and the withdrawal is there.. full force and tearing at me.. But I am refusing to give in and focusing on the positives that I have experienced along the way so far.. I managed to use the money that would have been wasted on cigarettes in a month to buy myself a new PlayStation Vita, which I am super please with because I'd wanted one for a while... My sense of smell has gotten stronger, but not as dramatically as I was lead to believe, and my Girlfriend seems happier that I'm not all smokey when she kisses me now.

Anyways, sorry for rambling there.. I'm glad to see there is a subreddit for something positive like this. lets kick this addiction in its ass!

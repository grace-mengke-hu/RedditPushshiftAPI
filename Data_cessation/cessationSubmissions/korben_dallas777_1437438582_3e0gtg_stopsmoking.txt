Every cigarette that I will ever smoke in my entire life, I have already smoked. I'm really done.

I feel great. I didn't plan to quit, it just happened and I went with it. Threw a house party, drank too much, smoked a dab, got sick for an hour. Yuck. 

Once I was done I lit up a smoke. Holy shit it was disgusting. I was surprised at my own sudden disgust. Threw it away. It feels like a get out of jail free card.

Do not give up, there is no downside to quitting!

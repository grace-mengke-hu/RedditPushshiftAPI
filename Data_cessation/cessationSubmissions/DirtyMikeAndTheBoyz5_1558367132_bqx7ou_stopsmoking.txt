I fucked up...

So I went 20 days....20 goddamn days without a cigarette. I thought I was over them and it took one shit night at work and 1 cigarette yesterday to have me nearly finishing a whole packet...

 fuck this hurts because I have no excuse..the nicotine was gone. I was on my way and I fucked it..

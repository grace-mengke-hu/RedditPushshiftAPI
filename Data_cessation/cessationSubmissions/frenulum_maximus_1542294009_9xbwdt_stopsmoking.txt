I just cant do it

I tried quitting cold turkey 50 times atleast, read that book easy way to stop smoking, watched cancer videos, gums, patches and im still smoking. Im 26 and im afraid i wont live to 30, my mouth are always sore, tongue hurts, i cough all the time, but i just cant stop. Just 5 minutes ago i smoked and i was thinking about this but i dgaf, my brain does what he wants. But its not just smoking lack of will, but everything else in my life, its such a rollercoaster of short term pleasures and feeling like crap. I cant cope with tiny amounts of stress, if i need to send email il plan it for week and stress myself, smoke, have crazy anxiety and panic, and i always smoke when im under stress(which is always). 

I feel like im low iq or borderline retarded because of this. Longest without cigarettes was like 10 hours during which i just stayed in bed wanting to scream and hit wall with head. Then i couldnt take it anymore and i ran at 4am in rain to far away gas station. I started when i was 12 and since then its never less than pack a day. 

Vaping did nothing, my friend let me try and i instantly wanted real cigarette after. I tried for few days to get used to it but no. 

I dont even know what i want with this rant but there it is. Now im craving cigarette again and i know if i get out of bed il do it.

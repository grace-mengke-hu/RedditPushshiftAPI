Jeez AirBnB

I'm about 8 months smoke free, I just needed a one night place so I booked a cheap AirBnB.

 The listing said 420 friendly and that's cool but my goodness can you smell they also smoke cigarettes. 

Never again will I try to save a bit of cash. I can barely breathe and the smell is disgusting! I'm so glad I quit, I can't believe I got jobs with this underlying stench that I'm sure followed me around.

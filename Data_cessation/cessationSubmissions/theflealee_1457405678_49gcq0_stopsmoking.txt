Smoked two cigarettes earlier this morning, very disappointed in myself.

I've been trying to get back into my local mixed martial arts gym to train a bit and before this I hadn't smoked in about a month so I figured my cardio was going to start to rapidly improve and now I made this mistake. I just hope two cigarettes don't effect it that badly.

Either way I'd appreciate any advice on how to combat any possible effects on my cardio. Thanks guys. And obviously yes I'm not going to continue smoking and I'll definitely be looking to this sub for inspiration. Thanks again.

Everything actually smells realy bad!!

I've understood that I got a pretty good sense of smell. And now that I've quit (12th day) yuck the world smells bad!! The smell of food lingers for hours in the rooms of the house. All the exhaust gasses in the streets almost make me puke. Parfumes are even worse! And a lot of bad smells I cant even identify while walking the streets, but it sure aint freshly mowed grass. I hope to get used to all this sometime soon, cause I realy hate it...

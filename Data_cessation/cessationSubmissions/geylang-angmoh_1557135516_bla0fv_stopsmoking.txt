Relapsed on the weekend and it reminded of one reason I should never go back - tonsillitis

Was having some Saturday night drinks with a lot of ice and cigarettes in between, so it fucked up my throat and I have a painful inflammation/infection, again.

I have a history of tonsillitis caused by smoking, but at times I just forget, and drift to cancer sticks anyway. Sitting at work now and regretting every bit of it.

Not another puff! I canâ€™t afford to feel this shitty in daily life, let me reset the timer again.

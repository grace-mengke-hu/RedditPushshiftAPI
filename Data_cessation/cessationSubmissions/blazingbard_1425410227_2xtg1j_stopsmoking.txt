200 days and counting

That first month was brutal, I think I lived here ever day that month seeing others with large numbers next to their names inspired me to be one of them, to just add one more day to my name. Every day was a struggle, so just know that if your on day 1 or 30 or 199 just keep fighting that little bugger on your shoulder he'll go away after a few minutes and soon you'll not even think about it any more.  
Just one more day, tell yourself that every morning until you that little craving is no more and you're free of the chains. 
Stay strong fellow quitters, we can do this.

One week, for real this time.

Here we go... Seven days without cheating, without "only socially," without "only at the bar," without "only after work," without "just one after a meal," without any of the other excuses I usually start to make, excuses that always start me off down the same slippery slope back to a pack-a-day habit.

I'm not giving in this time. I've had to reset my badge twice, and I'm not doing it again.

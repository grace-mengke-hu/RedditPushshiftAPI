2 days in! So glad I found this subreddit!

So, it's been 48 hours since I quit smoking! I treated myself to a sushi dinner. This has been my second attempt at quitting. I've been smoking since I was 17, I am now 21. 

The reason I want to quit is because my gums are decomposing and it scares the hell out of me! Also, I used to be in really good shape but now I can't run a mile to save my life. I'm pretty much broke and really should not support my habit any longer. I also just want a better lifestyle. 

My boyfriend smokes. He's been smoking 10 years now (he's 29) and I really want him to make this change with me. He wants to quit but he is way too dependent on cigarettes. :(

Also, if I get weak moments, what should I do? Are e-cigs a bad idea? I really want to quit the habit all together. 
Finals are in two weeks; if I can get through finals week without smoking I feel like I can accomplish anything!!!

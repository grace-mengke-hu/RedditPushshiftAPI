5 days in

So for the ....th time I have given up. I'm five days in and coming into it with a much more open minded approach. I am using an app called smoke free. It tracks my progress, showing how many cigarettes I haven't smoked, how much money I've saved and how many extra living hours I've gained. All along with percentages of lung activity, breath and many other things affected by smoking.  Before this would have seemed daft to me but this time I am really determined to quit for good. The app is really helpful as it does remind me of financial benefits as well as health benefits. 
My problem in the past has been the time after the chemical addiction has passed and I am left with the psychological battle. The beer always has a hand in my failings along with 'stressful' situations. But as well the app having the features I mentioned it also has daily tasks. One of which was to enter in communication with fellow quitters. Just writing this is giving me more determination. Thanks for reading

Day 4 cold turkey.

I live in a polluted city in India and usually have breathing problems through every winter. Last week I got back after time away visiting relatives and simply couldn't breathe anymore. Smoking made my throat swell alarmingly, much more so than ever before. A few days and several antihistamines later something snapped and I just stopped. 

^ I have(had?) been smoking for a decade. Anywhere between 5 and 20 a day at different points in time. 

Day 1 and 2 weren't nearly as bad as most people irl and online say, but I suppose that's because my physical withdrawal included severe flu-like symptoms: postnasal drip, a slight fever, continuous coughing, a sore(massively swollen and painful) throat, stuffy/runny nose, all my muscles ached. Didn't feel like smoking anyway(though I'm sure if quitting wasn't my aim I'd have smoked anyway). Couple of cravings but that's about it. Not much anxiety or restlessness or whatever. Was really really fatigued though. 

Day 3 was slightly messed up. The flu stuff subsided, body pains increased and I was anxious as well as restless for the first time(I should mention though that I have bipolar disorder, so coping with mental symptoms isn't as difficult as I imagine it might be for someone who hasn't been to extensive therapy for the same). Was still very fatigued but forced myself to clean the apartment, do some light exercise and walk my dog. At night I think the withdrawal peaked. For a few hours nothing was in my control. Was convinced I was dying for a while, but slept it off. 

Day 4(today) has been a breeze compared to 1-3. That is, apart from the fact that I'm very short of breath. Seems to have eased up a bit now though, so I'm hoping it stays that way. 

On the whole I'm quite surprised at how easily this is playing out. Not that it isn't difficult, just not as horrible as other people(and the internet) made it out to be. Hopefully I can make it to a month and from there to forever. Thanks for reading.

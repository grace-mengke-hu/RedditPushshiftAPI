Stopped smoking for 2 years, recently picked up a packet. Needing some inspiration to put them back down.

As the title says, I quit pretty successfully 2 years ago. Recently went through quite a stressful period and resisted throughout but then the opportunity arose and I indulged in one and then bought a packet.

Had one a day and thought I would just stop once the packet had run out, but found myself buying another packet because I wasn’t ready for it to be done yet. Now up to sneaking out and coating myself in body spray and breath refreshers about 4 times a day.

I don’t want to be a smoker again, I don’t know why this is different. I literally think after each one “I didn’t need that, that’s the last” but then the packet stares at me again a few hours later.

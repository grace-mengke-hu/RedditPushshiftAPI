Just passed 10,000 hours off non-smoking

I don’t really check my Smoke Free app anymore, but I just opened it up to see what the stats were, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that I was at 10,052 hours. 8,377 cigarettes not smoked.   

I can’t even really remember the last time I had an actual urge/craving to smoke.   

Good luck to everyone else!

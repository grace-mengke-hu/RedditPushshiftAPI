first day as an ex-smoker, what should i do with my final pack?

some background: 17, been a half-a-pack-to-a-pack smoker for 2 years now. Thankfully, as a singer, i was able to notice the clear adverse effects of smoking before giving those herb-y dicks a chance to do any real damage. I've attempted quitting once already, and though i would usually have the willpower to keep up that kind of thing, my cravings were exacerbated by knowing that i had no way of lapsing even if i wanted to, leading me to speed off to my local lukoil without having a chance to actually think about what i was doing. I've planned quitting today after work for the last week or so, and i made sure to have a nearly full pack on me to avoid the aformentioned slip. I just feel like having the chance to smoke but just making it clear that i didn't want to would be a smart move. any opinions?

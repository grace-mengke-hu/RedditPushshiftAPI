5 years this September (God willing) thanks to Chantix!

Just stumbled on this site after seeing Uniquestring's daughter's post on my main.... I teared up because last month was a close buddy of mine's 1 year anniversary of his death from small cell lung cancer...  He left behind 3 daughters, and a host of other grieving family and friends.

I stopped in 2009 at 40 years old after having smoked for 25 looooong years. 

I had tried to quit before, and just couldn't do it!  I have over 11 years in recovery from a host of other drug and alcohol issues, so why couldn't I kick this easy habit?!?!?  I felt so weak and powerless; sitting huddled in the smoking section with all the other smokers, rain, sleet, hail, whatever....  just getting that smoke on!  The wheezing at night and in the mornings in bed; the coughing up of tar and crap, the wheezing, the MONEY, just everything about the damn addiction drove me INSANE!

My mother mentioned Chantix to me, and that she had quit using it.  'I am a non-smoker Mikehod' she said; 'just try it!'

She knew I had concerns; I mentioned to her that I had read articles about the side effects blah blah blah.

I finally tried it...  half heartedly!  I bought a carton of smokes and started the prescription (you can smoke for the first couple days... sounds good to me!).   By day 6 I put down the cigs and have not had a puff since!  And there were barely ANY cravings!  The girl I quit with did not quit, however, so individual results will vary.

I have never been more proud of the fact that I no longer suffer from an addiction to cigarettes/nicotine....  Now to work on my FOOD addiction!

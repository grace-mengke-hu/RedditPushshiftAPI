Quitting driving me emotionally and mentally drained

I feel like a big ball of stress 99% of the time and I feel kinda dizzy and my brain feels so foggy. I wasn't even a crazy smoker, either. Smoked socially when I'd drink and turned into smoked 0-5 a day (mostly 2/max for past year, 1/max for past 2 years), depending on the mood. There would be many days I would go without one just because. For example, two months ago, I didn't smoke at all. Just because. I didn't really want one or need it. It's weird because now that I'm consciously trying to stop them for good, I feel like I *need* one and constantly crave and I feel so sick and tired and sad and cranky. :|

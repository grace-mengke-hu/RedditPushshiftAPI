Make it stop (Almost 1 month in)

Quitting filtered cigarettes was easy. Having to make the lifestyle change to stop smoking spliffs (weed and tobacco hand rolled, and unfiltered) has been soul crushing. But I've made it this far by convincing myself that "I just don't do this (smoke tobacco products) anymore". Well, the mood swings have been awful. I take SSRI's to control my depression and suicidal thoughts. Even with the meds, those sorts of intrusive thoughts still manage to creep in. I fucking hate it more than anything.

I hope that whoever reads this knows that they're not alone, and the progress that they've made thus far is a product of *you and you alone.* Don't let things outside your sphere of control allow you to make an exception "just this once".

You. can. do. this.

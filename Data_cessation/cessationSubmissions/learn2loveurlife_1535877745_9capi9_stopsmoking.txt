5.5 Days cold turkey. Last night I was getting all emotional over a minor issue. It felt so real and so devastating. I felt worthless piece of Shit. It was weird. I didn't smoke. I woke up in the morning, did my usual things, went to work. Wow I'm so happy now. I don't know what the fuck is going on

But I'm sure whatever is happening, happening because of Nicotine withdrawal. Fuck my addicted brain is so fucking manipulative. This time I'm not going to get myself trapped in this shit. All I want to tell you guys who has just gone cold turkey, don't give up. Just don't. You will realize on your own that you can lose nothing by not smoking.

Issue with quitting (a bit long)

I haven't quit yet but I've cut down considerably (pack a day smoker for almost 7 years, to 4 or less per day consistently now).

I smoked as little as 2 per day for a few days, and during that time, I didn't get cravings.  I smoked so I could stop bouncing off the walls.  I'd fidget constantly.  I'd want to pace all the time.  I couldn't focus on anything, visually or mentally - my eyes would dart around from one thing to another because my mind wouldn't be able to focus on whatever it is I was looking at.  Reading long Reddit posts became an arduous task - I'd read a paragraph and then move on to something else.  It's not because I was craving a cigarette, but because my mind was suddenly going a million miles an hour - thinking about anything and everything.   Basically, I was very easily distracted.

So in order to make myself "chill out" so I could actually think clearer and be able to focus on one task for a long period of time, I'd smoke until I felt myself able to hold a train of thought, or be able to do a task without being easily distracted - the amount smoked would be half of or a third of a cigarette.

I quit cold turkey a few years ago for two weeks and had the same symptoms - incredible distractibility and increased fidgeting, not because of cravings (I didn't crave a cigarette until someone offered me a whole pack, which made me start up again because I didn't have good willpower then), and it lasted for the whole two weeks.

I fear that when I quit smoking, I'll be dealing with the same symptoms, but I'll have nothing to be able to "chill me out".  Drinking isn't an option (I intend to be completely sober and I don't want to trade one addiction for possibly creating another), exercise doesn't chill me out because I end up getting distracted mid workout and going off to do something else, and I'm not using nic gum, patches, or e-cig because I'm quitting my love-affair with nicotine - not just smoking.

Any advice?

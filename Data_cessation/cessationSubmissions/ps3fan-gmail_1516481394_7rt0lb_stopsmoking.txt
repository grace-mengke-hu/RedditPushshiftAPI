Quitting Tobacco and Alcohol?

After reading a few studies they say that it takes about 2-4 months before brain function(dopamine and a few other things) returns to that of a non smoker. My question is would drinking during the first 4 months or so increase the time for that to return to normal since drinking messes with your dopamine level and all sorts of other brain functions? I am on day 37 of my quit and Alcohol for whatever reason is not one of my triggers(I actually don't like nicotine mixed with Alcohol) so I am not worried about relapsing. I just want to know if there is any reason to abstain from drinking to get my brain back to normal ASAP(I can't concentrate at work and really want to get back to 100% quick). Thanks a lot!

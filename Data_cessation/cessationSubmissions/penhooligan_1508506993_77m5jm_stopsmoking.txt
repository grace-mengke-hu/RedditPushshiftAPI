Just Smoked My Last One

I'm writing to declare that I have just finished my last cigarette. 22 years of self-harm is enough. I have 2 beautiful children and a supportive wife and I can do it. I have to. No more excuses, no more waiting. The time is now.

Any words of encouragement will be greatly appreciated.

Smoker for two years now, I need someone to help me stop smoking.

Hey, first of all, sorry for the format since I'm on mobile.  

I've started smoking a little over 2 years ago and it's finally time to stop. I've tried to stop smoking a few times but couldn't make it. This time, I wanna stop smoking for good, but I think I can't do it alone. I know it's a lot to ask, but would any of you guys be ready to help me out with this?   

I've been thinking, if there was someone I could just talk to during the day whenever I get cravings and all. It would seriously be a big help. I would ask friends to do it but they either have never smoked in their life or still smoke and don't want to quit. I just think it'd be of advantage to have someone who went through it all himself/herself.  

If you are ready to take the burden and help a brother out, I got all kinds of social media we can exchange, Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, Kik, Whatsapp, Twitter, you name it.   

Thank you so much in advance.  

P.S.: If you find any grammar or spelling mistakes, English isn't my native tongue so ignore those.

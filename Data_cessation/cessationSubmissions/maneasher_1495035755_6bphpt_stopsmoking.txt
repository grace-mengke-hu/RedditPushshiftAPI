Stopped after on off bouts for 13years

Well today marks day three. I read Alan Carrs Easy Way. I'll say it helped me re-shape my thought process, effectively making it easier for me to stop. Of course the caveat is that you have to want it.

So, I'm estimating a savings of around 500$ a month! I was two packs a day. 

I'm excited. Currently getting trough the first week. But nothing has proven intolerable. It is nice when you have made the mental decision to escape from a life of imprisonment. 

I wish all of you luck!

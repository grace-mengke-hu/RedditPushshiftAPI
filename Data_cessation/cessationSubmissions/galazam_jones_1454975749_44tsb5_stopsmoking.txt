Using the stop smoking app. Experiences?

Hey, I'm new here :) 

So I've been smoking occasionally for 6 years now and for about 3 years I would consider myself a smoker. It got worse and worse and I never really did mind because of a rule I lived by but I realized it's actually a waste of money and I could improve myself in a lot of ways if I quit. So I got the quitsmoking app that tells you when you are allowed to smoke (atm I'm at once every 2.5h and 6 per day which is already notably less than I smoked before. My goal in the app is to stop within the next 85 days. 

Has anyone here got experiences with that app and could give me their reviews or maybe tips to make it easier?

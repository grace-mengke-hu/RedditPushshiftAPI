Haven't smoked cigs since new year! But can't say the same about smoking a Juul. Can't tell if I'm doing good or bad. Anyone else have similar experiences?

I've been smoke free since New Years which I'm very happy about. At 25 I had been smoking for 12 years and was disgusted with myself. 

Being smoke free I have used a Juul as a way of weening myself off the smokes. For one I feel a million times better and an overall happier. But my family says it's the same thing and really aren't even proud at all. Are they right? Are Juuls really that bad for you? Should I be happy with my progress or am I just cheating myself here?

Fuck smoking and good luck to everyone on their journeys!!

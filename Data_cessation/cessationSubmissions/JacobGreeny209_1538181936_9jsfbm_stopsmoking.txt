Why does my face turn red and flushed when I smoke?

I think I have a slight case of Rosacea and when I smoke my cheek/nose/forehead get even redder for the entire day and that is even with just a couple cigarettes per day. My face also feels like it doesn't want to cool down after I smoke and  I feel flushed for the rest of the day. I figured this out when I quit for a few days, I noticed my face did not flush or get as red as when I smoked. Can anyone explain why this is?

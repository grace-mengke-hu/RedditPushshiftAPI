What was your moment of clarity?

My moment of clarity was actually quite trivial. I had been on the fence about quitting for a few months after being a smoker for over a decade. I had come down to the last cig in my pack and was about to smoke it, when I just didn't really feel like doing it anymore. I just looked at the filter of this solitary cigarette and felt that it wasn't worth the money or the trip to the store to get another pack. It just wasn't worth it anymore.

And that's how 6 months ago, on a Friday afternoon after being a human chimney for a decade, I had a moment of clarity.

Edit : I'm enjoying the stories and the reasons, thanks to everyone who has responded.

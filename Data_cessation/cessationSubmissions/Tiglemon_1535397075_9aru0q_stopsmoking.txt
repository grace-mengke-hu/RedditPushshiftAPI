Question to People who smoked over 10 or 20 yrs and have now quit over 3yrs..

What motivated you to quit in the first place ?
How did you over come the start of the journey ?
Especially battle the mindset of 'one for the day I'll start tomorrow', what made the shift in that mindset? If you remember. 

Thanks for answering. And congrats on your quit. 

I'm a smoker for 12-13 yrs. Want to quit but maybe am not sure. Need to think through and commit better. 

All the people in this sub rock for staying quit or try to. Let's do this!!

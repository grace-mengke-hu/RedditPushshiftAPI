Mood swings?

~20 hours in, probably the longest I've ever gone, but this time is different, something changed this morning and my willpower tripled. I have absolutely no desire to smoke, and I know I can keep that up by keeping up with you mates. 

Getting home from work is always my biggest trigger, as soon as I step in that door after working a long 8 hours I ran to my balcony for a smoke, but not today, and not ever again. I'm not promising you guys because I can't follow through with that, I'm promising myself.

Getting to the point, I'm experiencing HUGE mood swings, I've gone from angry to tears several times in the last 20 minutes alone, it's a feeling I've never felt and I need a way to deal with it or I'm going to go crazy, has anyone else felt like this? How did you overcome it? I don't want to snap at the people I love because of problems I caused for myself, that's not fair to them. 

Thanks and stay strong,

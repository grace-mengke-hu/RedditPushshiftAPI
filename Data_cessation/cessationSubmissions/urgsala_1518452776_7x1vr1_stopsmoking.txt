Breaks at work

Hello,
this is day three for me. I have to return to the office in 2 days, but I dread it. Usually I smoked most of my cigarettes and later vaped most of my liquid while at work. I managed to have a small break of five minutes every 1-2 hours. I need this kind of break because I need to get away from my coworkers and the customers, which tend to be annoying and there's a lot of time pressure. Also I feel it helps me concentrate, but I rationally know that this is not the case. At least that's what the quit smoking gurus like Allen and Spitzer are saying. How do you cope with situations like this? How do you manage to increase your concentration when a craving kicks in?
Thanks!

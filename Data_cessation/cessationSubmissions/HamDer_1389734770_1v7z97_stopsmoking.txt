A bit proud of myself!

I started cold turkey, no patches, no nothing. The first week was pretty though, and so were the many first parties I went to. Over time it has faded, and now I only get triggers once in a while (waiting on the bus, being bored, etc.) but they seem to exit out the back of my skull within 2 seconds of entering. The one thing I have to stick with for now is the **FACT** that I cant handle to smoke even **ONE SINGLE cigarette** before I relapse. So telling myself that "Hey I did it for this long, and I can easily do it again" is **not** an option. 

My philosophy has been pretty simple:

* Do everything to avoid triggers first week.
* Week 2 and beyond; do whatever you usually would do, even go with coworkers on smoke break. 
* Don't even try a cigaret once.

So today, I'm going to treat myself with a 5 km run, and a trip out bouldering later!



To every person who just started, I wish you the best ~~of luck!~~ self-discipline! And to everyone else; Keep on being awesome!

Odd achievements

Last night I was getting ready for bed, I took off my cardigan and prepared to throw it in the laundry bin. I stopped, sniffed it, realized it didn't smell like smoke and hung it back up in my closet. It's the small things that amaze me about my quit. Cheers to the small things that keep us going.

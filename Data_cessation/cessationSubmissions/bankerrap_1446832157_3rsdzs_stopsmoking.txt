Je ne fume pas: nice moment in French lesson

Bonjour!

Ok I'm not French, but I am living in a French speaking country and taking lessons.

My teacher said: je me fume pas (I do not smoke) and I said: moi non plus (me neither).

It hit me that I wasn't even lying! Yeah, I don't smoke, even in French.

Bonsoir!

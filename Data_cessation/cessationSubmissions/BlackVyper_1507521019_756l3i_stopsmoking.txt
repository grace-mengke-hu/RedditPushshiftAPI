13 days smoke-free after 27 years!

I'm 13 days in now after being a smoker for 27 years. Vaping worked for me, after about a year of false starts with it. Turns out I just had to find the right flavor (I find just about all of them utterly revolting!) I nearly gave up giving up.
I probably tried 40 different flavors until I got to the one I use now. Now my vape is my new best buddy.
I can't say I feel much better yet (still got crud in my lungs I'm getting rid of!) but being able to go about my day without having to plan between smoke stops is just so liberating.
The things I've learned so far is that there is no vape juice that tastes like a smoke (even that black note stuff doesn't) so getting rid of that expectation helps, and that using an app (I use Smoke Free on the iPhone) that tracks your progress can really help.
Good luck to everyone trying to quit!

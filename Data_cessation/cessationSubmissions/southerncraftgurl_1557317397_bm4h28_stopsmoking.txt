I'm REALLY not smoking!!!

Me!  Who knew?!!

I started day 4 at 10pm last night.  I can't believe I have gone this long without a cigarette!  And no one has been killed (except the night king) and I haven't even had the first hissy fit or anything!

The advice and support I've gotten from this sub has been amazing and I wanted to thank you guys.

I'm still surprised that the cravings have not been as bad as I had imagined in my mind's eye.  That's not to say they don't suck because they do.  But they are survivable!  Everyone in my life is involved in my quitting.  No matter what I say to anyone, no one will assist me in getting a cigarette.  I love them and hate them at the same time, lol.

Thank yall so much for helping me and putting up with me this week!

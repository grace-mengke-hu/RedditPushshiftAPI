My first day. The want is there, but I am fighting it.

Yesterday, I hope, I smoke my last cigarette. It's currently 5 pm and I did not smoke today anything. Feeling a little bit weird. Gonna try to stay non smoking because it's too expensive, but damn, do cigarettes taste good. But anyways, trying so hard not to smoke. I almost made it through my first day. I must keep going.

having an absolute nightmare of a time trying to quit, any help/support appreciated

Hey guys, 

I'm 39. I started smoking at 15. smoked about 2 years and quit for 7. started again my last year in college and smoked for 10 years straight. finally quit with Easy Way. easiest thing ever after months of trying to quit various ways. didnt have a single craving for two years. then was on a stressful trip with a woman I was dating that was a smoker. Out of nowhere, with no previous cravings, i suddenly lit one up. It was awful, I got sick, I hated it. but somehow now I've been a pack a day or more smoker for a year again. I hate it so much. I wake up in the morning unable to breathe. I can't work out. My lungs are constantly sore and I cough and spit phlegm all day. It's the worst my lungs have ever been. I've been trying to quit for about 4 months now, and I can't do it. I tried Easy Way again, listened to the whole book about 6 times, and it doesn't work anymore. I've tried cold turkey over and over and I make it maybe 3 days and then smoke more than ever. I'm at my wit's end. I'm not doing Chantix because I know someone that lost their mind and changed their whole personality on it. but I dont know what to do, I'm living in hell with the smoking and I can't quit. And I live in NYC so the packs are $14 and it's killing my bank account. 

any advice much appreciated. thanks for listening.

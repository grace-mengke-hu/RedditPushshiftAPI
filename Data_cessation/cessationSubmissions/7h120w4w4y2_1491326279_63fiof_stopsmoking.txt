what do your smoking cravings feel like?

they feel like I am missing a ticket to a piece of heaven/paradise internally, from my stomach to my heart to chest to my throat

i cant stop thinking about how nice it would feel to smoke another cig its like the feeling that everything is ok and nothing is wrong when I smoke a cig

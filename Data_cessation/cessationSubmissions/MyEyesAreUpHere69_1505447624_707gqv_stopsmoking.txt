Just remember the “stress you relieved” after a smoke comes back in a few minutes

Same as all of you, smoking “helped” my stress but then 5 minutes later those jitters come back. That smoke isn’t helping anything, it’s just a form of procrastinating and not dealing with the root of the stress. This has been my biggest helper, 2 weeks strong. I work with a shit ton of smokers and the temptation is very very mild now. I do not envy their smokers cough and spitting up snot every five seconds. That’s more stressful than anything.

Was I ever addicted?

I started smoking when I came into university earlier this September. I moved up from 3 cigarettes a day to about a half a pack a day around October. I decided to quit three weeks ago and I haven't had a cigarette since; it hasn't been hard at all for me other than thinking about smoking once in a while. Is my refrainment from this habit easy because I didn't smoke long enough?

Almost at six months, constantly thinking about giving up.

I've quit smoking (cold turkey) almost six months ago, but the last couple of weeks are extremely difficult. And while thinking back at the last couple of months I realised I don't enjoy being a non-smoker. I crave cigarettes almost every day and I can't wait to get back to smoking. But there is always something stopping me from giving up. The thought of dying at 60 and leaving a family behind or being sick for the rest of my life. I don't think I can do this much longer on willpower alone. 

In two weeks I'll go on a roadtrip with some friends. And the fact that it is my first trip without cigarettes in about ten years frightens me. Without cigarettes I haven't been able to enjoy the things I normally enjoyed doing (drinking, going out, doing social stuff) at all. Now i'm afraid that i'll cave and start smoking on this trip to actually enjoy myself. I never realised how much smoking controlled my entire life, and i'm afraid I won't find a way to stop it. Don't know what I want to achieve with this thread but I just needed a way to vamp. English isn't my native language so I apologize if there are any spelling or gramatical errors in the story.

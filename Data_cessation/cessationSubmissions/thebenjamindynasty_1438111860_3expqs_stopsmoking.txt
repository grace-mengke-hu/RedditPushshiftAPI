Today, I will NOT buy another pack.

I'm 23, I have been smoking for 10 years

I was in High School / I was a musician and an athlete and an honors student / I started smoking weed with my musician & artist buddies / I thought it was cool to smoke cigs too / I loved being a badass behind my parents' backs

I stopped being a musician and an athlete and a scholar / I got suspended from high school right before senior prom for having weed on school property / Lost all my friends

In was in college / I was a musician, but I couldn't do my best because I was always high and just smoked half a pack of cigarettes / I was athletic...but I always ended a workout with a bowl and a cig / I was in the art school...my inspiration came while smoking, my peace came while high, and my relaxation came from tobacco

I "quit" 4 or 5 times / I relapse every time and convince myself its fine to smoke / I'm still young / I've got time

Thesis year of college and my best buddy dies...drug overdose / He is my cousin...one year younger / We are supposed to be business partners for life

Start smoking a lot...weed, cigs, pills / Start drinking a lot...breakfast, lunch, dinner / Start sleeping a lot...late for work, missing class, lose touch with friends & family

I finish up college / I get a major raise at work / I'm getting in touch with old friends

I haven't drank in a month / I haven't had coffee in 2 weeks / I have been working out for 2 months / Life is good

But my favorite habit has gotten out of control...a pack and a half a day (easily)...American Spirits too / An eighth of weed a week...no problemo

This is my fresh start / I'm gonna do it this time / Cold Turkey Time

Today, I will NOT buy another pack

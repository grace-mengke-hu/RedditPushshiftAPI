what's allen carr's take on the first-cigarette-induced euphoria

I remember my first two cigarettes:

the first one I tried because I was convinced from a high school mate. I did one puff, inhaled, coughed like crazy and got disgusted from it, and threw it away.

Then after some months, I met up with the same mate getting coffee together. It was a generally happy situation as we were 3 or 4 guys. I was the only one not smoking. So I thought myself "let's smoke". Forced myself to go through the first puffs and then the nicotine rush came, and it was so goddamn awesome: I started feeling even more happy and started laughing like an idiot at anything.

Now, Allen Carr never mentions this in the book. He simply says the first cigarette is disgusting for everyone. It might have been disgusting to inhale all the tar and combustion products out from the cigarette but the nicotine going in the brain was a really good feeling. 

How do I cope with this when trying to understand the brainwashing that we receive on cigarettes mentioned from Carr?

I'm surprised.

I browsed this subreddit a few times a year or two ago and I happened to become aware of Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking.  I didn't do anything with it until recently, but reading that book was/is extremely helpful to me, and not only am I not seeing it mentioned in the last couple of days I'm actually seeing advice that is contrary to what he recommends.  I am all for whatever works of course but I wonder what others have to say about the book, and if you have read it.

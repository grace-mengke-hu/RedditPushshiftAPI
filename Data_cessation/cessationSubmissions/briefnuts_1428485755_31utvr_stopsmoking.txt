(Day 4) the monster is a toddler with a temper tantrum...

I'm having a tough time focussing on work at the moment and I don't think it'd be in my best interest to swear at my coworkers, so I'm just gonna rant for a bit.. Forgive me..  

So yesterday I casually mentioned to a co-worker that I decided to quit. This morning when it was about the time I'd normally go out for my first smoke break, she called in to ask how I was doing (even though yesterday I specifically told her that this wasn't my first rodeo, that I'd be extremely cranky for the next couple of days, and that she should probably keep her distance.. ). I was inches away from telling her to mind her own g*ddamned business, how dare she bring up my addiction?!, [insert randomly chosen swear words] and other colourful language.. (This is my boss's wife btw.. ) And then I thought "what the fuck is wrong with me, she's just trying to help.. " I felt like screaming and above all I just felt ANGRY!!  

Anyways, I then envisioned my addiction as a small child that was throwing a tantrum because I was denying it candy, and I... laughed?? When I started writing this post I was furious and now I'm amused.. I guess moodswings are part of the package? I feel silly now.. Time to get back to work.. Thanks for listening :)

I promised my girlfriend I'd quit smoking when we achieved a year together. Here we are, yesterday we made the 1 year mark.

The thing is, I don't want to quit smoking. It's 9:40 in the morning right now and I haven't smoked since after dinner yesterday. She is the sole reason I am doing this, since I smoke for free and have no health problems from smoking. 

When I promised her I honestly didn't think we'd make the year mark but here we are. Our relationship also hasn't been going great, which further reduces my will to quit smoking for her.

For some information, I'm 22 and I've smoked for 8 years, 10-15 smokes per day.

I'm not quite sure where I'm going with this, but I felt like I needed to tell someone.

Need to quit smoking ASAP. All advice is welcome

I've been a cigarrette smoker for 15 years, and I feel the need to just stop it, but everytime I try, I fail miserably.
This is affecting my skin, teeth, and overall health. I have two beautiful daughters and I want to be the healthiest mother I can. Please help!

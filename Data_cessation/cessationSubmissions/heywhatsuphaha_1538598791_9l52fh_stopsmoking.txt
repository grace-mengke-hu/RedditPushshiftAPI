Paranoia — part of withdrawal?

Hi everyone,
I’ve been smoke free for about a month and nicotine free for almost 3 days (was using a vape).
I’ve generally been feeling okay aside from the mood swings that have become less frequent. However I feel like there is some sense of paranoia. I just get the feeling that people are talking bad about me sometimes. Was just outside with some family and family friends and all was well until i looked at two people talking and suddenly got paranoid thinking they were talking about me. 
I got up from the situation and said goodbye because I didn’t want any more paranoid thoughts or for me to be around others while in a weird mood.
Is this a part of withdrawal? Did any of you experience any paranoia or delusions? Am I just overthinking things? I don’t know.
What are your thoughts?
Thank you

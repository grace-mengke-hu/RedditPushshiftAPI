Where do I start?

Hello all, I've lurked on this sub for a bit, while smoking and continuously said I need to quit one of these days. Well, that day is today. It's come to the point where I don't even enjoy smoking, I just like the idea of it. Thinking that it makes me feel good is a lie, maybe for a couple minutes but not even as long as I'm smoking. I regret each one, but it's always like "oh just one more.." or "next week" or any kind of excuse I can think of.
I've dealt with addictions in my past and this has definitely been my crutch but fuck crutches. I'm done. But I don't know how to begin. How do you not smoke when just one? I just can't see the big picture when I'm faced with a craving.

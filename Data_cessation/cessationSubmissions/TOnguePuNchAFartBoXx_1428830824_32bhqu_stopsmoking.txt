What do you do when craving

I have been cold turkey for around 5 months now after a stint in hospital and have been craving cigarettes for the last week and was wondering what you guys and girls do when in that situation 
So far i have resisted the urge to want a smoke but somedays the thought of buying a packet lingers in the feont of my brain for hours

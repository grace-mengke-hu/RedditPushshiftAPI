3 days nicotine free!

First time poster here. 3 days with absolutely no nicotine at all. No patches, nicotine vape, gum, nothing. My method? Taking advantage of this ailment. Can't even enjoy a cigarette while in this state. My throat's killing me, I'm hacking shit up every five minutes, and overall, I just can't enjoy cigarette like this. Hate being sick, but it may have been one of the best things for me.

I think I've had my hardest moment!

Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

So, today I'm starting to get kinda proud of myself on my first week smoke free. And I'm almost through day 8. Around day 5/6 were very rough days, I had a couple of beers with some colleagues and ended up half drunk at a gas station and bought a pack of cigs and a lighter. I didn't smoke them right away, but waited until I was home.   


When I finally got home, I sat down on my bed, unopened pack of cigs in one hand, a lighter in the other. I just sat there straight for 15 minutes just looking at the pack. I didn't open it, threw it in my sock drawer and went to bed. It's still unopened. After that moment everything started to get a lot easier to say no, not just to smoking but to drinking and other stuff aswell.

Even managed to start building up my old excercise routine again! Right now I really file like I'm on a way up and forward and actually really start to enjoy breathing in the fresh morning air. I'm not craving free, but the way my lungs overall feel, is a good reminder to not care about cravings!

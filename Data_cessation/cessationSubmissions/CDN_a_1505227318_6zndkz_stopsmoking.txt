Smoking and working...

I'm so used to timing everything when I'm working... well I'll do the next step of the project... (cigarette break)... another part of my project (another cigarette break) AND SO ON... AD INFINITUM... Now I'm using this Reddit site to occupy myself as I catch my breath and plan what is my next step. It's amazing how ingrained certain things become. This morning I'm having to remind myself... no you fool... a cigarette is NOT A REWARD!! Lol. Also I'm kind of scared as to what my crazy brain is going to try to convince me of when I complete my projects completely... which would have been a bottle of wine on the veranda and smoking ... I will not do this... and cannot drink for some while as I KNOW it will be my downfall for a while.

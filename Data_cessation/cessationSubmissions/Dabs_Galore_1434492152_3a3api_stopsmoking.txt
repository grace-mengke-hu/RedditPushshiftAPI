All I Want Is A Cigg

This is going to be a jumbled rant so bear with me. So basically everything seems to be going wrong. I nearly fucked up three hundred dollars worth of product today at work and got side-bitched at by my boss. What I mean by this is that he didn't directly bitch at me, but over the course of ten minutes or so I overheard him complaining about me to other employees. This pissed me off because I would rather him approach me and talk to me about it. Then I get home and my washer is broken and magically nobody knows what happened or even who used it last. Fucking great! Now I get to pay for that to get fixed since nobody else is going to (getting my roomates to do anything is like pulling teeth. Actually on second thought it would be easier to pull teeth). All I want right now is a cigarette to ease this stress.... why shouldn't I?

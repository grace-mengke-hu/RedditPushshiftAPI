Here we go!

Smoked my last cigarette this morning! Been a smoker for about two years, smoking a pack a day. Ready to be done with the awful taste in my mouth, the yellowing fingers, the gross morning cough and all the money I am paying (about $9.50/pack)!
Any tips for the physical need to smoke? I find that my hands really crave the need to lift a smoke to my lips, more so then actually craving the smoke itself!
Been lurking this sub for a few weeks and it just seems like such an amazing support system here!! :)

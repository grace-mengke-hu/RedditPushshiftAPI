Problems at day 3

its day 3, I feel well when I'm working. However I got super dizzy when walking.
I didnt get grumpy but instead I found my self super depressed so I asked my gf and family for help.
Guess what? Nobody cares. They told me to cheer my self up.
On the second thought, I remembered that I used to have a smoke when I was down and get back to them pretending I was ok. 
So no help from family tight now.Have u guys ever encountered such problem? What would u do?

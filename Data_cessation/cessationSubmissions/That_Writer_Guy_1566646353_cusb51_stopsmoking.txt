I need help so bad. I think I’m about to fall off the wagon.

I haven’t smoked a cigarette in 10 months but tonight those cravings came back. Worse than my first week. This past month I’ve been going through almost three Juul pods a day but it’s just not helping anymore. I’m having panic attacks over this shit and all I can think about is a pack of American spirit blacks. I know I wouldn’t be able to go this long doing it for myself but I don’t want to be a failure to my fiancé. I don’t know how much longer I can go if these cravings keep hitting me like this.

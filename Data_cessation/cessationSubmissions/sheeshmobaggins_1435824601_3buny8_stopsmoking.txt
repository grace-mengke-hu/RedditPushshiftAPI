Trying to quit smoking but feeling anxiety.

Did anyone else experience anxiety when trying to quit smoking? I have a bit of an anxiety disorder and tend to worry and get stressed out easily. Working in a busy coffee shop doesn't help, as I do most of my smoking on breaks at work. I always kind of thought as smoking as my way of "controlling" my anxiety, but I just want to be free of it.

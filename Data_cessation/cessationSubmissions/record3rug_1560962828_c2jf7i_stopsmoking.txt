Has anyone experienced an excess of energy after quitting smoking? What do you do to maintain it?

Last time I quit I made it to a little under a month, but I caved after becoming close to manic from insomnia.  Some times only getting a couple of hours of sleeps from nicotine withdrawal. 

I'm only on day two (TWO!), and I already had a restless night filled with anxiety.

What do I do to make this easier?

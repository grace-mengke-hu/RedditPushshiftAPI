No more Camels, today is the day.

I'm quitting today. I'm tired of feeling like shit. I'm tired of not being able to focus because I am thinking about the next one. I'm tired of spending hundreds of dollars a month to die sooner.

To give some background, I haven't been smoking that long but I'm already around a pack a day. I use it to ignore my problems, whenever I am stressed I just think "At least I can go smoke." Hence I ignore shit, and it builds up. But no more! I'm taking back control of my life today.

I know nothing I am saying is super insightful or inspiring. I just wanted to tell someone that I'm done. Good luck to all you bastards.

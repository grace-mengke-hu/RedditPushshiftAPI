Has anyone else felt over emotional about quitting?

Hi all! I'm on day 5 of my quit. I've quit before, so I'm familiar with the withdrawal of going cold turkey. My lungs hurt so continuing smoking is simply not an option. What I wasn't expecting is how sad I feel about quitting. Like I'm losing my best friend. Anyone else experience this?

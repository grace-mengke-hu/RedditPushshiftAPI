Been smoking for the last week...

Damn it feels bad to be a smoker again, couldn't even walk up a flight of stairs without getting dizzy and needing to sit down and I'm a kickboxer/powerlifter.

Sad thing is the cigarettes don't even feel good anymore, the way I used to get that orgasmic feeling in the stomach and the way it made my legs weak is completely gone, it just feels empty.

Not really something I'd usually do, just been having a quarter-life/existential crisis thing going on so went to my best known 'coping' tool. Only it doesn't work it's magic when I actually need it. I guess time to start all over again.

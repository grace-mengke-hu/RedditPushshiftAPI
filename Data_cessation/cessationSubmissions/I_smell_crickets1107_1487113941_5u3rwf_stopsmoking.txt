30th Birthday today and Ive decided it's time

I turned 30 today and decided it was time to quit smoking. These first 18 hours have been incredibly difficult. I drive a lot for my job and smoking helps pass the time. First trip today was three hours from home and I realized I had no idea this would be the hardest part of not smoking. Any advice is welcome, cause it's very tempting to just pick one up and continue my routine of 12 years.

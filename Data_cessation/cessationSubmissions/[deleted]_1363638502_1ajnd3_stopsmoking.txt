Manage to quit with just dumb luck!

I have tried to stop like 9-10 times before but it have never worked for more than a few days for me, but then i had some luck in the beginning of this year :D

I have smoked since i was around 15 (turning 25 this year) and at the beginning of this year i got a really bad cold and bunch of other things, wich lead to i couldnt get out of bed at all. First 2 days was just laying in bed with countless of waterbottles and watching netflix/sleeping, nothing else. Next few days i managed to get up and try to eat some food and smoke, but that didnt go so well. And after about a week of getting better i noticed that the nicotine addiction was just gone, Instantly threw out all my cigarettes and havenÂ´t had a single one since January 14th!

Sorry about my english

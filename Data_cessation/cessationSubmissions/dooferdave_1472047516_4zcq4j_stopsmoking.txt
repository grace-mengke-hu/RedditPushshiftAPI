Survived a smoky casino.

Even though it has been over two years, It was weird how I was genuinely surprised that they let you smoke in the casino. I sat at the blackjack table right next to a smoker. Some tables everyone was smoking but for me it was just the one guy. Now I will admit that the occasional second hand smoke is kinda nice but a couple of hours of it right next to me was pretty rough to take. I was surprised how often he lit up. I bet he smoked easily 5 or more in that couple of hours. The best part was not once was I tempted to smoke and was able to just ignore it for the most part and enjoyed my time at the casino anyway.

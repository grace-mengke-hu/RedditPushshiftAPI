One month!

I actually made it a month guys!  I feel kind of proud right now. I never went without cigarettes for more than a couple days since I started smoking 11 years ago. The benefits have been subtle for me. Much like the detriments of smoking, they creep in slowly but add up big time over years.  So I don't know if I really feel that much different, but I'm saving money and saving my health. What's great though is that I don't feel like I need cigarettes anymore. 

Here's what worked for me: reading Allen carr's smoking book, reading stories on here, smoke free smoking app, logging cravings, Altoids in the car. The first week was the worst by far. I still have cravings, but they are minor and pass quickly. I have issues with alcohol/drugs and food too. As much as it would be nice to get high every night and eat Ben and Jerrys, I don't because it would be too detrimental. What I'm saying is, I used to be afraid of having cravings all the time, but they reduce in severity and frequency over time, and yeah, I still get them, but it's not that bad. Life is good!

I want to stop smoking

I started smoking cigarettes about 6 months ago now as a response to a dramatic break up (end of a 3 year relationship I really didn't want to let go of). At the time I smoked a shit load of weed but with all the stuff on my mind it was only making my state worse, for whatever reason I picked up cigarette smoking and that helped me stay sober more often, at times it helped me open up to people and felt quite good

however i've reached a point where i'm over my issues post breakup, weed is no longer a crutch for me so I can enjoy it on occasion without it being an escape mechanism from all the shit that was on my mind at the time, cigarettes helped me in that aspect but I don't want to even look at them in a positive way as I know that just makes me consider picking another one up, now I find myself resenting the fact that I smoke cigarettes. Last night I finally allowed myself to realize that really all they do is make me feel shit, i more or less only smoke to suppress nicotine and behavioral smoking cravings. 

I told myself today would be the first day of no more cigarettes, but I still gave in. I didn't realize it would be this hard to just tell my self no. I've had 3 today, and they just bring me down, but I still get those cravings and feel like I want to smoke them, despite knowing in my mind that I really don't

can you guys give me some advice? i've tried to stay off them before (though without the realization that I really want too, more just had things going on in life that kept me busy) and the same thing always happens sooner or later, cigarette addiction is not something I really want in my life at all. I'm still young and really don't want to go through years of smoking, 6 months of nearly daily smoking already makes me feel shit enough about my self

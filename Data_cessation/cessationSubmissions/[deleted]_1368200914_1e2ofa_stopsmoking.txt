Inspirational quotes?

Today's my last day. From tomorrow on, I will be smoke-free, for real this time. Since I'm quitting caffeine at the same time, I'm expecting that this will be one of the worst weeks of my life.

I drew up a little calendar showing when the withdrawal starts, peaks, and goes down (side note: there should really be more specific data on how long each symptom of withdrawal lasts), and I wrote the reasons I'm quitting along the edge with some inspirational quotes: 

"A man must constantly exceed his level." - Bruce Lee

"Misery is comfortable. Happiness takes effort." - David Wong

I've been repeating "happiness takes effort" to myself over and over every time I want a cigarette but the timer I've set for myself hasn't run down yet. Did anyone else use a mantra to help them get through withdrawal?

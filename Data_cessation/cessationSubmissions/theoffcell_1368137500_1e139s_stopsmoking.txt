Woah. It's been a year!

Hey guys, I've been lurking without logging in for a while, so I kinda forgot about this sub. But I guess it's been a year and I just wanted to tell people that are wondering, "Will I ever not think about smoking again?" Well I obviously can't speak for everyone, but for me, the craving to smoke is almost nonexistent. I'm still constantly around people that smoke but it doesn't even cross my mind anymore. So, what I'm saying is, STICK WITH IT! It gets easier and it's totally worth it. Good luck guys!

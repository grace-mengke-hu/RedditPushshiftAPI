19 Years old, aspiring singer, working stressful call centre job. I smoke 20-30 a day. I need to stop immediately.

Hello all, I've been a long time lurker but I haven't really taken the plunge. But now it is time to end it. I always knew smoking was bad but it has spiralled out of control and I feel heavily addicted.
I've been smoking for two years.
I know the battle is mostly my own, but i'd love some advice and back up. 
Thank you, great work by all of you.

Eleven Months

It's been around eleven months since I've smoked or chewed. I smoked and chewed about a pack or two a day or a tin or two a day depending on the feeling. Then I quit. I am writing this because I didn't realize that I was eleven months tobacco free and I wouldn't have realized except for a person asking me how long its been. I stopped fucking counting. I stopped caring. The first couple days, I counted to hours. Then the days, then the weeks. It was at the back of my mind for awhile. Then it fucked off. I just want you guys out there who still know how many days its been to know that one day you won't, and its gonna be an awesome feeling.

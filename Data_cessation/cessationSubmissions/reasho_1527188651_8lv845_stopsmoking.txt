Ongoing Day 2...Stopped myself from relapsing day 1

Few quick things about me: Smoked on and off for 15 years. Last time I quit I stopped for about 3 months. Took 1 stog to relapse completely.

Just wanted to share my Day 1 story. I was texting with a person and knowing that if the response was negative, I probably would've relapsed. So prior to reading the response they gave, I took a sleeping pill so that I wouldn't be tempted to drive to the store to buy a pack. Well the response wasn't good, but I just passed out before I made any rash decisions. Morning came and now I'm feeling great about Day 2!

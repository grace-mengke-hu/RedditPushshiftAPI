haven't had a cigarette in 2 days. Just kind of stopped.

Hi guys, 

so i have only tried to quit once in my life. I quit for approximately 6 months, and got back into it due to silliness. (thinking i could handle having a few here and there.) but not this time MR. Cigarette! 

2 days ago i had my last cigarette not thinking it would be my last. i just didn't buy another packet and now i have decided that i am going to give this a real old fashion college try. I have never been a full on smoker (I would smoke a pack every 3 days) and am doing this completely cold turkey at the moment. i have noticed some withdrawal symptoms and moments of **insatiable lust for nicotine**, however it passes relatively quickly and i try my best to take my mind off it. Eat a lolly or do something. 

I am a relatively fit guy, going to the gym a minimum of 5 days a week and am 24 years old. I know this will get harder before it gets easier. Just wondering if anyone has any tips to get me through? should i take up using some kind of nicotine replacement or should i try stay strong and do it with out any help?

Vanity is as good a reason as any other. 10 days in.

I'm 24, and this is my 2nd time quitting smoking. I started smoking regularly in high school, then quit for 4 years. Prior to my quit date 10 days ago, I smoked about 2.5 packs per week, a little more during tough times. 

I really didn't think I'd be able to give up cigarettes. I started out smoking socially (i.e. only when drinking), and I eventually started buying my own packs to avoid the embarrassment that stemmed from constantly bumming from friends. As I'm sure many smokers can understand, I began to associate more and more every day tasks with smoking. Driving to class? Light up. 10 minute break at work? Light up. 30 minute break? Have three. A couple years maintaining this routine led up to my peak of smoking about 3 packs a week.

I finally made the decision to quit once I started noticing a couple of tiny fine lines developing around my mouth. I realized later that the appearance of these "fine lines" was exacerbated by poorly applied powder, but at that moment, the idea that I was expediting the aging process one cigarette at a time finally started to sink in. I look pretty young for my age, and as vain as it sounds, the last thing I want to do is age more quickly than mother nature intends. So here I am, 10 days without a single cigarette, and I really fucking hope it sticks this time.

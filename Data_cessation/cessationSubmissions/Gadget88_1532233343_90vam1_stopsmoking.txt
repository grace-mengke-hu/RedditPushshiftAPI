The fan was full of sh*t today. Still didn’t smoke.

Hello friends! Today almost everything that could have gone wrong did. I work as a restaurant manager and when I came in today, our operating system AND internet was down (the problems were not related!!!) . I spent 7+ hours on the phone with various tech support services and rummaging through the dusty rat king of wires that was set up 5 years ago when this place opened. (Did I mention our IT guy is on vacation this week?) The level of anxiety I felt was beyond anything I have experienced before - the longer I took to solve this problem, the longer our entire staff was handwriting tickets to the kitchen and taking imprints of credit cards the old school way (in a celebrity chef’s restaurant on a Saturday night!)

Very long and stressful story short,  I helped find a band aid until we can get real tech support Monday but.... through all of this (and the two beers I had once i finished) I did not smoke! And that, my friends, is the real victory. 

I don’t know why this quit stuck but I’m going with it. I smoked for over ten years, trying desperately to keep it from my family and coworkers. It was something very “off brand” for me and I loved being sneaky and smoking when I was alone. Cigarettes were my best friend and we had a secret together; I was more addicted than other people thought. But every day I’m making the choice to take my life back. I turn 30 this fall and I want to do it with as few vices as I possibly can. 

If I can do this, you can do this.

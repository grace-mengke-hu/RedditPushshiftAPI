I never thought I'd make it a year, but I didn't even murder anyone.

I think the most important piece of advice I've gleaned from this subreddit and talking to others who have managed to quit long-term: you must never become complacent and have "just one."

When I think about this rule, I think about my non-smoking friends.  They never have "just one" when they're drunk, or ask for a drag because they're having a bad day.  They aren't smokers, and they don't smoke.  I'm one of them now.

I still have cravings from time to time, but they're not at all similar to what I went through when I first quit.  Rather, I have thoughts like, "This would be a great time to smoke," or "I wish I could use a cigarette as an excuse to go outside."  It's easy to just brush them aside.  I'm going to a festival next week and caught myself having the insidious "just one" dialogue.  I'll get drunk and have just one.  Nope!

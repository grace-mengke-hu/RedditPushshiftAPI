I enjoyed my last craving

They're pretty rare now...I'd say one or two a week. Mild too.

In any case, I was walking across campus, and it was gray and dreary. Having lived in a rainy town before, I remembered that I used to enjoy lighting up a cigarette and walking through the drab. Just as I had this thought and an accompanying craving, I remembered that I haven't smoked in over four months. I smiled and then my craving went away.

The end. God it feels so great.

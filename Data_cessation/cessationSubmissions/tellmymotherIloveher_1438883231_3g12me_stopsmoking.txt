Checking in

Its been 217.8 largely happy days since I quit but these last few days I seem to find myself looking a little too longingly at friends and strangers puffing away and thinking "one won't harm me, xxx person smokes 'on occasion.'" I think it's a boredom thing and desire to change my feelings so just thought I'd write it down and bore you all instead of having it buzz around my head. Thanks for reading.

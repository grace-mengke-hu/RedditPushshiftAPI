r/stopsmoking, what are your reasons for quitting?

I personally am quitting in order to further nurture my growing sense of self-discipline. I've had a few cheats earlier on, but in comparison to a pack a day (sometimes slightly more), I'd have to say I'm making good progress. That and obviously I don't want carcinogens in my body anymore!

I've got to say though, my cough is insane. Anyone else feel a burning sensation in their chest & arms due to quitting flu?

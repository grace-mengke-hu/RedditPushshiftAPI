Worse Cravings? Day 8

Hey I quit 8 days ago and just heading into day 9 in a few hours. I am having a weird problem. The first week I barely had any cravings. Everything was just chill. Now I'm out and about getting some stuff done and I keep thinking a cigarette would help with my mood.

I feel terrible today for no reason. It's like everything is off and wrong and the whole world sucks etc.

But what's weird is I'm now a day and a half into the second week and I'm having worse cravings today than I've had this whole time so far.

I thought this would get easier. Now I'm super worried that today will be the day I cave and smoke. I keep wanting one so bad.

Why now? I thought this would get easier with time and not harder.

PS I had a dream last night that I was smoking and that I messed up and was beating myself up because I screwed up.

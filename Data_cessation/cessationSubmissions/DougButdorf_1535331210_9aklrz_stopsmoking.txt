I feel fucking terrible

Damn.  2D5H.  Been suffering from bronchitis and tried two weeks ago cold turkey.  Relapsed.  Stopped on Friday afternoon.  Saturday was a chore.  Short breath.  Sweaty.  Generally feeling like crap.  Going to Dr this week to see if there is some help with the breathing and coughing.  30 year smoker.  Really has fucked me up.

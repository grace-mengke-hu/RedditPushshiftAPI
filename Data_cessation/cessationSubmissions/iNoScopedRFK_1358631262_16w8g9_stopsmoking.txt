Haven't smoked in 2.5 months but still get urges like crazy sometimes...will these ever stop?

Hey guys,

So, I haven't smoked a cigarette in two and half months but I still get crazy urges to smoke from time to time. Will these ever go away? Or am I going to have these urges for the rest of my life?

Second, and this is slightly off topic but, one of the reasons I've been able to quit for 2.5 months is that I haven't been around anyone that smokes. In a few weeks I'm going back to see some friends who all still chain smoke and I'm afraid that I'm going to succumb and start smoking again. I know this is probably a long shot but, any helpful advice to keep me from relapsing?

New years smoke +

New years is getting close, I am about to pass the week mark and I am fairly f***ing confident. Now, I am going to a party as I'm sure most people are and here is the situation. I don't plan on buying a box. I believe 100% that come 1st January I won't have any craving. Is there much harm in having perhaps 3/4.

Now this leads me to my second second, is damage from smoking cumulative or can the body adequately heal? By this I mean if I smoke lets say 1 every 3 months, does my cancer risk level return to baseline(that of a non-smoker) easy enough. Or for every smoke I have is my baseline now higher than that of a non-smoker?

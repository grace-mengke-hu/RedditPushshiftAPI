I'm already feeling great!

I'm just finishing day 4, and things seem to be going amazing. I noticed today at the mall that when I was walking I wasn't getting out of breath! Usually a brisk walk puts me into a bit of heavy breathing but not today :) Also, I've driven 2 hours a day for the past 2 days and I was really worried about the urge to smoke but it honestly wasn't bad at all. My entire mindset is different this time and it's SO much easier. I feel like I have more energy as well. I'm only 4 days in and I can't believe how much better I'm feeling. It can only go up from here :) Oh, one more thing! My sense of smell is improving. You know how everyone's home has a specific smell? Well I actually could SMELL my home when I came home today. (well how I remember it smelling when I first moved here last August). I'm so happy and it's all thanks to you guys!

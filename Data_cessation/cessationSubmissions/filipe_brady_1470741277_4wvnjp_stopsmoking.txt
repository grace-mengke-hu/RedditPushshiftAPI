Tips to stop smoking

Hi, 

I really need to stop smoking. I started smoking 5 or 6 years ago more or less. I smoke half a pack per day but last week i was in holidays with a few friends and i realize that I smoked a full pack per day... that's why i want to quit. I just don't know how. I tried a few times in the past but all failed. What can i do? Can you give me a few tips? Thank you

Update1- I just started i smoked my last cigar 3 hours ago. Game on!

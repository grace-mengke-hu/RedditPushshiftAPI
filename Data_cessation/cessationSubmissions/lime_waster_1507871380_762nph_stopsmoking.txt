What are alternatives for stress relief besides cigarettes?

I’ve been looking to stop for a while now but whenever I get really stressed out from school I go right back to cigs. What do you guys do to prevent stress? I wanna quit while I’m young and haven’t done to much damage to my body. But whenever shit hits the fan for me I slip back to smoking.

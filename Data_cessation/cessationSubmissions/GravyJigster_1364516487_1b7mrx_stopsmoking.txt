Almost through day one. Feeling pretty irritable, but somehow managing.

Had a vicious debate with a close friend on a political stance I don't even believe in. Feeling really irritable. I want a smoke really really bad. Had a chance to today, but I  passed it up. So I'm feeling motivated despite feeling like shit.

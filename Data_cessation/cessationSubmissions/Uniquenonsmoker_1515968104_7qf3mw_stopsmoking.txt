Want to so badly. Kind of.

I’m picking up my kiddos shortly and of course it’s like pulling teeth getting a straight answer out of their father about anything at all! And I’m suppose to “start” soon so I’m crabby. I’m tired from working all weekend. I just want to run away a little bit and sleep for a few days ha ha. 

Anyway. Strong thoughts of smoking. Not craving necessarily just a desire to have my best friend in my hands while I avoid crying out of frustration. 

I’m not going to smoke. The process to jump back on that wagon is hardly worth it. I’m just venting. 

Thanks!! How’s everyone else’s Sunday?!

5 days smoke free

Hey guys , new to this community. Been smoke free cold turkey for the past 5 days. Feeling really proud of myself , just having some issues with my sleep pattern. Anyone else having difficulty sleeping and keep waking up many times in the middle of the night ? Sucks having to wake up tired all the time , haha well at least itâ€™s better than lighting another one!

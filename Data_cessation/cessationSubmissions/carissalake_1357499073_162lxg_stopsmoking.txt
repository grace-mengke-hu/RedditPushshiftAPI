Ant advice for irritability?

Hello! I quit smoking on the 2nd of January and my biggest withdrawal symptom has been lashing out for things that are insignificant. Anyone have any advice for that? Anyone know how long withdrawals will last? I was a pretty light smoker (4 or 5 a day if i wasnt drinking) for about two years.

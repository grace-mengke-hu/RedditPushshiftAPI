Treating myself to brisket on day 11

It feels like so much longer! But I've been living healthy and treating my body well for 11 days now, resolve strong as ever. I can't remember the last time I didn't put anything poisonous in my body for this long! I don't worry about how I smell, my mouth doesn't taste bad and my clothes seem cleaner. Cheers!

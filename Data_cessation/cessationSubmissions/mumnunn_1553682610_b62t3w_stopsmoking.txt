Reading Allan carr

I'm further along this book and I read something that makes perfect sense to me 'the only reason you smoke this one is because of the one before' how logical that is!
I just read a post on here by someone a year in, who sounded just like me and their post strengthen my belief that smoking really doesn't help me cope it's alls illusion.

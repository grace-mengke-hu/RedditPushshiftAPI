Third times the charm!

I quit last New Years for one month using the patch. Of course I stupidly ended up starting again. Then towards the end of last year I quit again. Thought it was forever that time, but after two months I relapsed. Well, now I'm almost on day 5 and it's actually been pretty easy. Got my badge on here and I'm excited to see the number climb. It's amazing how much better I feel already.

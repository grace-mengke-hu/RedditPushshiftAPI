1 day and 8 hours till I'm done with this crap

I have the stop smoking app and i just purchased the Allan Carr book off of amazon (about the price of a pack I might add) the app recommended I buy a different kind of cigarette so I purchased some menthals. They are disgusting! This was a great tip cause now every time I want a cigarette I think oh god they are menthals! They make me feel like I've never smoked before and brings me back to the old days when every time I smoked id feel a little sick. Can't wait to be done!

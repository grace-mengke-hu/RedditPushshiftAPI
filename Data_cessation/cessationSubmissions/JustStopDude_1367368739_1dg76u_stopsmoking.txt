Well I just broke down...

Pretty much I just threw about two months out of the window. In my defense...I have had a very bad day.

I have crippling fear of heights. I am stuck working on a crane automation project in a foreign country. I am supposed to do steel mill automation by my supervisor is a sadistic bastard and sent me here instead. 

One of the things I have to do is ride in a man lift, under the crane, to manually position fucking lasers. Did I mention I FUCKING HATE HEIGHTS?!?!

While up there tonight, its windy as fuck....far too windy to be up here but where I am at, worker's safety is viewed as a detriment to profit so up we fucking go. 

The Indian fellow driving the man lift seems to have zero concern for life or limb. Thankfully I position both our safety lines to the bottom of the crane because this guy was making me so fucking nervous. 

Why was that a good idea?

The fucker...don't ask me how as I am still trying to figure out how he did it, ran the fucking thing into the spreader and knocked the fucking man lift over.

I spent the last hour or so hanging next to this clown as we waited to get rescued. My crotch is fucking killing me from the safety harness. 

At least the fucker, responding to my threats of murdering him as soon as we hit the ground, offered me a smoke while we hung there. 

I needed something to pass the time and calm down.

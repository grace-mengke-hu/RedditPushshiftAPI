Went for a walk before bed last night, day 1.

Yesterday was my quit date to leave cigarettes behind me. I didn't struggle too much and did an alright job of staying busy. 
At the end of the night before I went to bed, I took a short walk to enjoy the nice cool air. It was so pleasant, it smelled nice, and my legs felt amazing. Now, I walk a lot and am a fit young man but I felt different. I felt rejuvenated in a sense. I wanted to keep on walking because it felt so good, I would have kept going if it wasn't as late as it was.
Just thought I'd share this, the first day is tough but if you can stay busy and keep a good attitude, you'll make it to the other side.

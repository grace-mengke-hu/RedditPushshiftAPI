quit many things a week ago

I quit smoking and drinking cold turkey almost a week ago. Now a time before I've quit, but I quit quitting the very next day, so this is progress for me. Pack a day smoker, ~2/3 of a fifth a day drinker. I've taken 'measures' to disallow or otherwise dissuade me from purchasing anything, and eliminated anything I have in my possession. I don't feel half as bad as I expected I might at this point, but I do feel a little lethargic. Nothing a cup of coffee doesn't fix though

Anyways, just me reporting to ghosts who may or may not care. Good luck to yall

After a few attempts to quit, I realized the parts that makes it hard for me. Would love some advice, more inside

Hi!

So I tried quitting a few times lately. I even went on vacation for 2 weeks, and didnt have any trouble not smoking, had a nicotine spray thing though, which I used twice a day (1 spray = 1 cigarette). When I got home, back to the usual everyday life, things started getting hard. The spray didnt do it for me anymore.

It made me realize that the hardest times for me, is when Im bored. These times are very hard to avoid, and it will happen. I can keep myself active and doing something, a lot of the time. But still, I will have boring moments.

How did you guys get through the boring moments, and avoid smoking?

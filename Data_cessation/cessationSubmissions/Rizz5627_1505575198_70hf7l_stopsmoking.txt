Need support quitting smoking

Hey fellow redditors,
Im a 23 yo male who has been smoking for about 5 years now. I currently smoke about a half a pack a day. After many times attempting to quit I am very serious this time around. Smoking have been ingrained in my daily routine and i have many triggers for it. (car, walking to class, doing homework, after a large meal and while drinking.) I don't want to be a smoker for the rest of my life. I've tried nicotine gum and even replaced smoking with chewing, but in the end I've always end up buying a pack. Wish me luck friends, I don't think I've ever felt this motivated to quit.

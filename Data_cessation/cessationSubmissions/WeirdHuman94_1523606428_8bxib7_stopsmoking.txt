"Cigarettes are like your best friend, the one you turn to when you're sad or happy."

I'm in between quitting. I went three days without smoking and I know I did it all by myself and am super proud, so much so that I know I'll stop smoking soon. I don't keep a pack. But this is something my therapist told me and it helped. It helped because I felt like smoking when I was sad and I reminded myself that this relationship is over. I can't use cigarettes as a crutch. So anyone who's upset and reconsidering smoking, remember that you don't need this best friend. It's a toxic relationship and you need to choose you right now. 
And whoever's quit and going strong, you are doing brilliantly. :)

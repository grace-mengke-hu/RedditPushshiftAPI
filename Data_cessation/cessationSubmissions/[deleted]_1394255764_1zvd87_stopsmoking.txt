Day one after I quit for over three months.

I quit for over three months, but upon working 12 hour shifts and going back to school, somewhere in between I began smoking again. It has been three hours since I smoked my last cigarette and swore not to buy a pack. I'm half way through my shift now and I am so ready to go pick up a pack. I'm hoping posting this will convince me otherwise.

Half-a-hundred days. I am fucking amazing

And no regrets!

Now the smoking-dreams have started though. These are **so fucking mean**! They make your feel ashamed and sad and whatnot and then you wake up and need to find out why you are feeling so down only to realize there is no reason to! hahaha. Really. I don't like those. I don't like feeling like I betrayed myself. This makes it easier not to give in though (although I never felt the urge to anyways.)

A good thing is that my nose turned down a notch. No more smelling foul scents from half a mile away. That got annoying. Fiancée still stinks though.

 I doubt she'll be able to quit anytime soon. I hate that. Even worse is that I can't talk to her about my achievements, health benefits and the like, because she understands that as critique (I am not that good at sending the right signals I guess.) and gets infuriated with me. Oops. 

I just want people to appreciate my progress! That's what you guys are here for after all, haha.

The most impressive change to me still is my increasing fitness. with the help of some subreddits on here I build a bodyweight exercising plan that changes my entire body. It's so weird. I'm a pretty skinny dude so seeing myself putting on ACTUAL PECS is so fucking weird, haha. I earned over 1kg of pure muscle tissue over the last 1 1/2 months. I feel like the Hulk. Still below 70kg at 6 ft though, eating enough is the hardest task of them all. But yes, fitness works extraordinarily well with quitting smoking!

By now I saved over 80 €, if you include cannabis that's more like 300 €. Would I still smoke, that translates to over 1100 cigarettes. Woah.

To everybody that is struggling the ultimate advice I can give is just taking it one step at a time, keeping a close eye on your badge. It will give you the strength to beat the addiction. Never let yourself down! That doesn't feel nice (remember the dreams). 

**If a scrub like me can quit, you can quit EASILY**

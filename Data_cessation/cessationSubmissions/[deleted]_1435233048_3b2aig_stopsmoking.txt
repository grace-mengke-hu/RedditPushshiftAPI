One Month Today. Sometimes less is more...

Woohoo I've made it to a full month without smoking. It's definitely not easy but it does get easier the longer you continue on the right path. My main problem was not so much the cravings (there was still plenty haha) but the fact that smoking was on my mind almost all the time. I visit a smoking cessation clinic once every two weeks and she gave me some great advice that may apply to others that were making the same mistakes I was! Basically I was trying too hard to stop smoking! I had 4  quit smoking apps on the phone. Another hypnosis quit smoking app on my phone. I was reading 'Freedom from Nicotine' any spare moment I got. I was watching YouTube videos on quitting smoking. I was on here constantly reading other peoples stories. While all of these are all very useful, it was actually making things worse for me. It's no wonder I was constantly thinking about smoking or the fact that I'm not a smoker anymore! The past week and a half I've mostly cut out doing the above and the difference for me has been enormous. I still think about smoking but nowhere near as much and the dreams about smoking (which were almost nightly) have stopped. I'm only a month on my journey and won't be satisfied to say I'm a non smoker until I've reached a year ;-)

Back to square one.

Hey guys, long time no see.

I made my first real attempt at quitting last year while I was travelling. I used this subreddit, a smokefree app, and all sorts of tactics to try quitting. No NRT,  cold turkey. And it worked for a long time!! Went from March first to November 11th without one. 9 months with no puff. 

Then going through a breakup and back to being alone, I relapsed. I spent a few weeks over the holiday period with a lot of friends who smoke, and started buying packs again.


No more. I've reset my app, set a new quit date, and I'm ready again. Ready to taste and smell, feel my emotions properly, and have some impulse control.


Relapsing is not failure. It's a setback. I'm ready to fight round two ðŸ’ª.

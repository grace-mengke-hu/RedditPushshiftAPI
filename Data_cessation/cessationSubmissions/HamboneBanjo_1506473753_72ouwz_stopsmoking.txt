My quit story

I've never really stated what's driven me to quit, not even out loud to my friends and family. I'm sure mine is a common story but I got to get it written down, not for you, and maybe not even for me as much as it is for my sister. I am the youngest of five children. Both my parents had serious heart problems. My mom, who didn't smoke, had a heart transplant and was fortunate enough to survive 11 years with that heart. My dad, who smoked Camels every day, wound up having a quintuple bypass. They both passed in their early 70's. So I already had good incentive to quit, but I would rationalize that I was probably only going to make it to my early 70's either way. Stupid, I know. 

Then my sister started getting sick this summer, very suddenly. My sister (52) and I (39) are the closest of all the five siblings, even though she has a twin. My sister smoked from her teen years and often expressed guilty feelings that I started smoking, believing that I was following in her footsteps. I always reassured her that it was my decision, even though I did start at the impressionable age of 17. 

Well, you may have figured it out by now. My sister passed away shortly after she started getting sick, after one week actually. There was no warning, no wake up call. Turns out she had a series of heart attacks, although she only really experienced back aches and soreness in her body. Turns out she had 100% blockage in one of her arteries. She quit smoking as soon as she found out but it was too late. This woman spoiled me rotten, all the way until her passing. In a way, I even believe that she gave herself over in order to motivate me to make and commit to this drastic life change. Well, there's my quit story. I don't know if it's helpful to others or not. I just had to get it out there. Thank you.

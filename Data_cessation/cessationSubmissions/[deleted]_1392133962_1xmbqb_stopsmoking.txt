Almost 200 days...

Fuck. Fucking shit. It's 5 days short of 200 days, and it's now just getting so hard. The past two weeks I've had nothing but cravings. All I want is to go to the store and buy a pack... I know if I do, 195 days would be for nothing... but I want to so fucking bad. I feel like it's just not going to work..

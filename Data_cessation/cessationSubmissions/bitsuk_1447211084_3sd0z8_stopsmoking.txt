It's really annoying me when smokers ask me for out.

It's really tempting me when smokers ask me for out. I told my colleagues I'm quitting, they don't take it seriously and make it fun of me. The most annoying thing is they ask me to go out for smoking every time they out. Sometimes they try to pull me out of my desk!

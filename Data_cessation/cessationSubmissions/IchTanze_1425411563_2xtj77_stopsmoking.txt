So first week in, and I think I have zero restraint when it comes to telling people off.

Usually, I can be so calm and collective, you know, little things here and there bug me. I can focus on my environment, my current senses, maybe meditate a little bit, and whatever is bugging me is no longer significant. But today? Yesterday? Day before?

I think I've angrily snapped at like 3 of my friends (not best friends, but friends non the less) and 2 acquaintances.

Maybe it's because I'm not going cold turkey? Maybe it's that i'm using nicotine replacement therapy? (gum) I just can't stop telling stupid bitches off, and it's really hurting the people around me.

All the while my coworkers and boyfriend think I'm doing amazing. They just don't see how my friends see me right now.

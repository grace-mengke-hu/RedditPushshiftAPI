This time it's sticking.

I've been smoking for about 5 years or so, I suppose almost 6. I was just studying abroad in Italy for the past 4 months where the smoking culture is large and the cigarettes are cheap. Last night I got home and decided that I'm quitting. And I want it to be for good. I even threw the last 2 un-smoked cigarettes from my pack away. I'm ready to be healthy again for the first time in a long time.

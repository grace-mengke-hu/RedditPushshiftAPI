Apps?

My quit date is Wednesday. I notice a lot of people posting screenshots from various quit-apps on various social sites and thought it would be cool to do the same; was just curious if anyone had any recommendations. I looked over the offerings in the app store and was just kind of inundated with too many choices. Do you folks have any favorites?

Coming up on 32 hours free

Had my last smoke yesterday round 5pm. It's almost 1 am here. The last 32 hours have been kinda easy to be honest, I got cravings but they weren't really that hard to ignore and I had the habit of needing to get up and go outside, but it just seemed kinda easy. Is it going to get harder over the next few days, what can I expect to experience. Don't want to get cocky and fuck up. Thanks guys

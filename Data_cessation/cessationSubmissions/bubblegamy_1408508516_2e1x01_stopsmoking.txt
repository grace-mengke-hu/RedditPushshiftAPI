I really want to help my dad quit smoking.

Hi everyone!

My dad is 53 and has been smoking since maybe his late teens/early 20's. He smokes maybe 5+ cigarettes a day, almost all at night after he comes home from work. I've been asking him to quit since I was a little girl (I'm almost 20 now) but only ever so often, since it was always super awkward once he started getting all defensive. But this past year, I've been bringing it up every few months because I've become more and more worried about the ongoing damage he is doing to his body.

It is interesting because otherwise, my dad is a completely reasonable and pretty health-conscious man. Just in the past half year, my dad has lost 25 pounds (he is now 185 lbs at 5'10" and working to lose more) and dropped his blood pressure from 160/120 (!!!) to 125/85 by diet and exercise alone. He is SO proud of his weight loss and always talks about his "strong will". Even I am impressed with how much self control he has these days when it comes to eating healthy. He talks about how much healthier he feels, how his heart rate is lower and how he doesn't feel so sleepy in the afternoon anymore. I told him that that's really great, that I'm really proud of him, and that maybe he should start thinking about quitting smoking, as he'll feel even better! He always chuckles nervously and says that he's trying to focus on one thing at a time. I let him say that for this entire year, but tonight I decided to be harsher on him.

At dinner, I asked him when he's going to quit smoking. As usual, he gives me the "I don't know... I need to think about it" cop-out answer, to which I reply, "Well you have to set a goal or you're never going to quit." He then started saying the usual: "Work stresses me out, smoking lets me relax and recover." So I ask when he's going to stop being stressed out, to which he doesn't have an answer to. I said there's never going to be a time when there's finally no work stress and therefore a cue to quit smoking. I told him his "smoking helps me relax" excuse is the same excuse alcoholics give for needing to drink. I told him this "recovering" he's doing is actually harming his body more.  To my surprise, **his denial was so strong that he replied, "I don't even smoke that much a day... it's not doing any harm to my body."**

I reacted with incredulity and told him that if he's going to keep smoking, he at least has to get a thorough lung health checkup every year. Still in denial mode, he told me, "I checked three years ago, and it was healthy!" The denial in this man was seriously so shocking. This is my father, a man of reason, a scientist, a chemist by profession, a person who **refuses to eat fucking NUTELLA because it has too many chemical additives**. His definition of healthy in terms of foods is SO out of line with the fact that he smokes cigarettes every day. I told him if he wanted to "destress" and be unkind to his body, he might as well eat a scoop of ice cream every day and it'd still be better for his health. His response? "Too many calories..." 

He hates talking about it. He gets all weird and nervous and laughs a lot... which only happens when I bring up smoking. He loses all sense of reason and gets defensive and becomes in denial. I can tell this is a touchy topic and he's way too prideful to have a real conversation about it.

I told him if he wasn't going to set a date, that I was going to set one for him. The end of 2014. He is going to have to be clean by then. He very reluctantly "agreed," but I had a feeling he only said that to stop my pestering. I want my dad to WANT to quit smoking, because I know that's the only way he's going to succeed. But I know I need to be the one to convince him, because he's way too complacent with his habits.

What do I do, Reddit? He very halfheartedly suggested nicotine patches. Should I just go buy them as a sort of gift for him, to get him up and running on this whole quitting thing? I told him he needed monthly goals so that it'd be easier for him to quit by the end of the year.

I'd appreciate all sorts of advice, from quitting methods/schedules to follow to convincing arguments that made you or someone you know realize they needed to quit. 

**TL;DR**: My dad has been smoking for over 30 years and I finally decided that I need to stop putting off convincing him and helping him overcome this challenge. Any advice on how to handle the situation would be much appreciated :)

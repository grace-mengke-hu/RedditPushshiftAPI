Day 10, 3rd and Final Quit

I haven't taken a nicotine lozenge in over 24 hours. This is where I got hung up the last time. I got through the entire 12 weeks (mostly) smoke free and literally the first day off the lozenges, started smoking again. The vast openness got to me. Without my "crutch" it was just not smoking for the rest of my life and I wasn't quite ready to face that yet. 

I had some mild thinking like that this time but this time I'm ready. I'm not feeling any withdrawal, I'm not feeling the depression I felt last time. But I'm also not completely relying on the Willpower method. I genuinely don't want to smoke any more. There have been some weak moments but I just let those ride and tell myself, "this will pass." I tell myself this is the last time I ever have to go through this. If I give in, even just one time, I'm perpetuating the addiction. I'm feeding that little monster. If instead I put in the work and say no, its voice will get softer and softer until one day I realize I haven't heard it in a long time.

Missed it!

Darn, I meant to make this post when my badge read 730. Which, if I'm not mistaken, is 2 years.

**2 years!!**

At this point, I'm 100% confident that I'm not going to smoke again. I still get the odd craving, most often while watching a film. (Why is it that so many films feature the Beautiful People doing unspeakable things to their bodies with cigarettes? Could it be, by any chance, that the tobacco industry gives Hollywood loadsa money?) But I just laugh it off - "oh, is that thing *still* at the back of my brain?"

When I actually smell cigarette smoke, mercifully infrequently these days, it does not appeal at all.

Needless to say, I'm healthier, happier, and richer than I ever was as a smoker.

To all those just setting out on this journey, it may seem that I'm impossibly far off, over the horizon. But you know the old saying: the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

And if you haven't yet even taken that first step... Just Do It!

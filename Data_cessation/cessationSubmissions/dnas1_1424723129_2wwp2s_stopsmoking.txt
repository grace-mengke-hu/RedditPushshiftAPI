Its only logical

I am a logical person. I usually follow protocols that are tried and tested and usually deliver success. For years i did something that hurt my health, shortened my life, had an impact on those around and to top it off i paid rediculous amounts of money to do this. Now for a logical person this battle to change has finally finished and its now 1 week of me being a completely logical. Life isnt about being logical, but it definitely isnt about smoking or the addiction that comes with it.

Convenient method of carrying nicotine gum

I am trying to wean myself off of nicotine altogether, so I have decided to try nicotine gum. The bulky packaging is just that... Bulky. Does transferring the gum to a more convenient pocket-sized container damage the integrity of the product at all? Does anybody have a recommendation on a more convenient method of carrying the gum outside of the bulky plastic packaging?

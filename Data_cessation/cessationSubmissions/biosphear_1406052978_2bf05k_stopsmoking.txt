really anxious to stop..

anyone else have bad anxiety about stopping? I'm terrified I will have bad physical or emotional side effects. My dad is dying (he smoked for years and years, smoking isn't the cause of his cancer directly but I'm sure it's correlated) and I'm worried this isn't the best time to try. But when is, right? His cancer has made me realize I need to stop.

Sorry if this was already asked many times but what are some side effects people have had when they stopped? Is it better to decrease slowly and then stop? Or stop cold turkey? Thanks everyone, it's inspiring to read this subreddit.

Just finished Allen Carr's Easy Way

I saw his book recommended on this sub and decided to try it.  I am so excited to have my LAST EVER cigarette in a few moments (for those that haven't read the book, he recommends waiting to smoke your final cancer-stick until after you've finished).  I'm going to just sit and not enjoy it at all and think about how terrible horrible no-good very bad it is.

I started smoking when I was 18, quit when I was 21, then started up again when I was 23.  Been back on it for about a year and a half.  Pack a day.  I've tried to quit several times this year (oh shit I mean last year), went about a week each time, and then caved.   I was miserable every time I tried to quit.  I felt like I was depriving myself.

Carr's book helped me understand I am not going to be depriving myself at all!  There is nothing to give up.  Smoking does nothing for me.  I have never been more excited to quit.  It doesn't seem so scary anymore, and I'm actually looking forward to these next few weeks.

I will say his book is soooo repetitive and a lot of it seems like he copy pasted whole paragraphs.  But maybe that is necessary to drill the idea into your brain.

But I digress.  Here's to a smoke-free 2015!!!

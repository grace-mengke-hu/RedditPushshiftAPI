Day two

I stopped smoking about two years ago for six months. I felt great and then started smoking cherry cigars on weekends with my friends. Soon after that I started smoking again. Well, no more! It's my second day today and I feel strong. I might just pop in here everyday for some moral support. Oh btw Reddit gave me the courage to try stopping again.

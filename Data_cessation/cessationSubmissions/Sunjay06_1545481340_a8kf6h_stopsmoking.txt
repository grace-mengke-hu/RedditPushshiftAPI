Omg Guys!

It’s been 25 days.... and I’m still feeling kinda foggy with mental fog. It’s like my ability to focus has been cut down to half, I’m not really in the moment I feel. This is really starting to feel screwed up. I just dislike this feeling. Quick note: No I’m definitely not taking another cigarette and I don’t wish to at all. Other areas of my life has improved drastically, my stamina, my sense of taste and smell, my skin and lips etc etc. I just wish I could improve this one thing! It’s like living in a dream state. Haihhh sorry I just need to vent out!

Decided to quit for the second time today.

Hey everyone. Today marks the second time I've attempted quitting. I thought maybe if I made a post here and other people saw it I would be more motivated to keep to my word. The last time I quit I fell victim to the "one can't hurt" idea... one obviously become two which became three and, well... you know the story. Hopefully I learned a lesson from that and this time will be my last time. I'm only 22 but I've been smoking for 6 years now. I tried ecigs, which worked for a while but it was just more convenient to smoke analogs. Might consider trying patches or gum at some point as the cravings increase, but for now I'm going to go cold turkey. It worked alright last time. 
Sorry for the long post and thanks in advance for any words of encouragement or advice.

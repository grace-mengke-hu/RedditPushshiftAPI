Close call today

I had an enraging experience at work today. Got ambushed at a meeting on a project I've been working on for four months by another unit. They threatened to pull the plug on their support and endanger the whole project if I didn't make concessions for them.

The urge to smoke after that meeting was the strongest urge I've felt since day 4 or 5. But fortunately I didn't break down. It goes to show how deeply engrained this fucking asshole addiction is. Before quitting, smoking would have been the go-to thing I did immediately after.

Now I'm stewing a bit, but it also feels really fucking good that I got past it without nicotine. I've been a bit of a fatass since quitting, so I'm gonna do a heavy workout followed by a joint to get the rage out (still smoking gancha from time to time).

Thanks for reading and listening to my wrathful speech. It is possible to get past shit situations without the demon weed. Big ups to the NYE quit crew.

I'm very close to quitting, but I can't seem to be content with whatever cigarette I deem to be my last.

Im ready to quit, but every time I get to that 'last' cigarette or pack, it doesn't feel right. 
I don't know if that makes sense, so my question is, what can I do to make that last pack the last pack? 
Edit: thanks guys for your helpful words! I will be having my last joe tomorrow.

100 days!

I just posted recently for three months, but today is 100 days and I'm inclined to post again.

 What's really amazing to me is that those 10 days between went by like nothing. Long gone are the times when delaying a smoke by a day or even an hour was a huge struggle. Ten more days down, and hardly a thought about it.

 I encourage anyone who's hesitant to just take the plunge. Day one is tough, but before long a day without smoking will just be like any other day.

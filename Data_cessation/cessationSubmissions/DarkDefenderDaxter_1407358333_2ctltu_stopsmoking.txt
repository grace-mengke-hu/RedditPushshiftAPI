What can your SO do to help you quit?

First off, you're not a redditor and have no interest in reddit. 

You're 22 and have been smoking ~pack/day since you were 15. (At one point up to two packs, down to less than half a pack.) You don't want to quit smoking, you like it, it's fun, it's social, you've been smoking since you were 15! But you don't have the money. You need to move out of your girlfriend's house (where you live rent free, you pay for electricity but the max for that is $100) in less than a month because she's moving an hour and a half away. You don't have enough money saved up to pay for a deposit and first months rent. And with a pack costing about $8, you're spending about $250/month on smoking alone. You can always move back to your parents house though. You try, you bought an app on your phone even! But you just like smoking too much. You tell your girlfriend you want to quit. You know the monetary consequences. 

What can she do to help you?

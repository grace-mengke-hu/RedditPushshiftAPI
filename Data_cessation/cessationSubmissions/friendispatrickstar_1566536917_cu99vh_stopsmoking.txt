Welp. After 4 years nicotine-free, I fell off the wagon after a nasty divorce over a year ago. I recently finished MY LAST ONE...

...it HAS to be. I have a wonderful toddler and I don’t want to have emphysema by the time she is 6. (Not to mention my awful crutch is ruining my bank account.)

I HAVE to go cold turkey. The ONE time I made it past 48 hours was when I went cold turkey. The slow fade does NOT work for me. I also know I have to completely cut out booze. It’s the one “trigger” that makes me “socially” smoke a pack of cigarettes in 4 hours. I’ve cut back to a time or two a month, but I know if I wanna kick cigs, booze has gotta go too! (Waaahhhh! Lol)

I’m strong minded, and I know I can’t quit again FOR GOOD. 

I’m just looking for advice on how to make the cold turkey part less miserable. Last time I quit it was only bc I HAD to bc I was pregnant- so while I can’t attribute my irritability and mood swings completely on nicotine withdrawals - I know they probably would’ve been bad had I been not full of crazy hormones anyway. 

Any advice for a cold-turkier to survive? I am an already stressed af single mom who works from home (I feel that I must clarify it’s an actual remote job- I’m not hocking essential oils and mascara on Facebook lol.)

I just don’t want to snap at my kid. Toddlers are already trying af and I’m only 3 hours in and fiending.

Give me both strength and advice friends :)

Thank you all!

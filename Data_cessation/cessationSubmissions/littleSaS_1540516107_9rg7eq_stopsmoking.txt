I barely even think about smoking any more

Every couple of months I wake up in a frantic sweat because dream me has been smoking again.

I'm pretty sure there's nothing that would make me smoke again but in my dreams I am tipped over the edge at the slightest provocation. Dream friend offers dream me a smoke and I somehow can't bring myself to tell them I don't smoke, I find a full smoke in the ashtray that has suddenly appeared on my workbench, I get off a plane that I've been on for hours - whatever it is, dream me is happy to light the smoke and then fret about it to the point where I wake up feeling awful. 

It doesn't take long for me to realise it was just dreams, but it annoys me that my subconscious is so quick to fail.

I wish she would just take all my good advice and quit for life.

Blood Pressure Increase?

Have any of you found your blood pressure to increase in the initial days of quitting smoking? Mine is in pre-hypertension range (139/87). I'm not sure what mine was recently, but in the past, it was always good.

It's day two of quitting and my new PT just did a bunch of checks which is how I know the up to date score. I'm 27, thoughts?

last night i fucked up

to put in contaxt, 2nd of april i celebrated 1 year without cigarettes.

last night \(night of 27th april\) i was at a friends house and kind got carried away and was doing other things \(not drinking. i just took about 5 something mg of xanax, as i get anxious in social sitatutions and meeting new people \- mind you my xanax use is extremely rare as in it hardly comes out the box\) that ended up lowered my inhibitions to smoke cigs. i smoked about 6 of them in about the 1.3 hours the half packet was handed to me. then i left as knew would only get worse and now i feel really sick. its fucked up because i hardly go out at socialise, yet one time i do this fucking shit happens. im not convinced i would have done this under any other circumstances. i didnt drink anymore, didnt take any drugs \(apart from xanax\) and didnt smoke weed. i dunno what the fuck to feel \- on one had i feell like i'm completely resetting my counter which has been going better than ever, on the other hand i feel it may just be a blip in my recovery as i really dont think outside those circumstances would do that shit. 

let me know if you guys had anything similar to your recovery milestones, wether you regard as blip or not and what he keep you sane at a time of a 'relapse' with smoking.

thanks for reading my message and good wishes to all you.

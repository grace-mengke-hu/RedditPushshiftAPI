60 Days!

I've made it through 2 months and I am very proud of myself. This sub really helps a lot, so thanks everybody! For those people just getting started: It got so much easier for me after week 3 or so.  I still get the occasional craving (even the occasional STRONG craving) but they are brief, infrequent, and manageable.  Stay strong, everybody, and thanks again.

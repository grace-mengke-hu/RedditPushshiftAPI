Tough mucus after 3 months of not smoking?

Hey guys I quit a little over 3 months ago.

Now ever since i quit i have syrupy mucus at the back of my throat. Like you would cough up with a cold. I'm not actually coughing, but tastes horrible and can make my stomach ache or cause nausea. I have quit for almost a year before and can't remember it holding on for so long.

Also it's kinda tough to swallow as well. I used to just tie this to the quitting, but now I'm in doubt if it's not something else i should get checked out. It just starts to bother me a lot and (while i will definitely hold on) it makes me want to smoke again just to get rid of it.

Can anyone relate or help?

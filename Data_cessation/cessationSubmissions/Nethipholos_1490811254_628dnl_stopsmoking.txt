How long until i stop waking up with the smell of smoke on my breath?

I smoke my last cigarette today and REALLY want to stop, but have had zero success over the past several years. Mornings have always been a trigger for me and at my new job 90% of employee's smoke. I'm so done with this crap.. I've got a 2yr old and another one on the way that i need to think about.

I've smoked maybe a pack every few weeks before, but since starting this job it's been close to 3 packs every two weeks. I'm killing myself and yet i cant stop. 

Disclaimer: i havent read the sidbar yet cause i rushed in here to post.. 

Resources? Tricks? Tips? Help? Fucking anything people! I'm dying here. I have a white board here at my desk and i'm planning on making tally marks for every day i go without a cigarette.

5 days down.

If you read my last post, you know that I was a work smoker, meaning I only smoked at work. Last week, I set up my quit so that my day 3 would be on a day off, so I could avoid confrontation while I spew terrible addiction black magic. Turns out, I was fine. My day 3 was easy. A piece of crumb cake.

Today, day 5, was what day 3 was for many others. I hadn't even left for work and the craving struck. All day, I was unable to focus or concentrate on anything. I was distracted, irritable, fidgety, and exhausted. I was also sweaty for no known reason. My anxiety was through the roof. My breathing was irregular and I hyperventilated more than once. I was on the verge of a true anxiety attack when I decided to get away from my desk and go for a walk. I walked and thought about what was happening to me and why it was so bad.

My smoking was linked to my anxiety and without the nicotine, I don't have a coping mechanism. This will take some getting used to, but I haven't given up. 5 days down, forever to go. Here's to forever.

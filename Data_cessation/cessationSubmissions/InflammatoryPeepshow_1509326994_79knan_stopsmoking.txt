Single mom quit for teen

I found out last week that my 15 year old started smoking about the time I started college a couple months ago. Instead of going off on him or trying to control it out of him (which I could no longer do anyhow), I decided to offer my help and extend a hand to help him quit. I offered to quit smoking with him. So far neither one of us has smoked and it’s been two days now. After more than 20 years of smoking, this has been so hard for me! I’m a recovering alcoholic (3 years sober feb. 8) and I smoked at least a pack a day, sometimes chain smoking, and boy oh boy what a bunch of holy habits Batman!!! I crave constantly and everything makes me want one! I paired cigarettes with everything. This is going to be tough, but I’m trying to take it one day, well one moment &amp; one craving etc., at a time. I didn’t want to vape because I didn’t want my teen thinking that’s ok for him to use for quitting.  I’ve been drinking water, eating candy, snacks and sodas, and sometimes I suck a straw at home (yes I said it), and I try to keep busy. Sucks so bad lol but I try to remember all the money I’ll save, and how good I’ll smell and the shame I’m leaving behind. Wish me luck, I’ll need it. Haven’t told more than a handful of people. If there was a meeting I’d go to it. I knew it’d be hard but damn. Okay rant over lol (: thanks for all the posts I’ve been reading. I need that right now. &lt;3

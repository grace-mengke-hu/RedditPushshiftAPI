15 days smoke free but still on patches

Some days have been better than others, it's like I'm missing a best friend that I hate, often miss him a lot, makes me very sad. This sadness is terrifying in that I'm not even off nicotine patches yet. 
I was a smoker for 10 years, 20-40 a day easily, now on the highest dose patch. Feeling lost but it's manageable, will this be unmanageable off the nicotine patches? Will the mental addiction still be present or less focused?
Has anyone else gone through it this way?

One year to the day

I quit May, 1st, 2014. Its been a ride, and quitting has been the best decision I have ever made. Honestly, I don't know how I would have done it without this group, from dealing with the nostalgia of the best smokes ever, to wanting to pull my hair out. You guys are awesome. 

To the guys starting out, you can do this. I quit cold turkey, the cravings never went away for me, but now I can just shrug them off and tell the voice in my head telling me to smoke, to just shut up.

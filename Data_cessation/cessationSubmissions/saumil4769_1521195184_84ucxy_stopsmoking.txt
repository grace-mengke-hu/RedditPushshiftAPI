Why is Allen Carr not known to all?

I have been smoking since the last 5 years. I read his book EASYWAY just a few days back. To me it has been the best smoking cessation book I have ever read. I was half-way through the book and started hating cigarettes! It's been 2 months since I quit and it has been a breeze. I strongly recommend this book to everyone here.  I came across this book randomly on Google play store. Having read the book as well as the reviews and my own personal experience, I wonder why is this not a mainstream book? Had I got this book before, my quit day would been much much back in time!

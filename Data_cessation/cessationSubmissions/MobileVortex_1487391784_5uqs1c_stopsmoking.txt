I really wanted one.

Went out with the smokers, tempted myself and though i was going to break down and smoke. They lit up and i almost puked. I got a trip in April that im worried about. Hope i get to the point that i won't even think about it... Never going to happen.  Keep on keeping on everyone! There is really no reason to do it.

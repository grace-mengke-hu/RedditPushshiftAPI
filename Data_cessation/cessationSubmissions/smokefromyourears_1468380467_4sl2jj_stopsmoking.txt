70 Days & counting....

It's been a great feeling being able to do away with the urge to smoke - guess after 70 days of abstinence, it can be safely said that it is possible to win over the temptation to light up!!
My Pulmonologist is happy that at his insistence I have been able to do away with the habit and surprise..... I have put on 4.6 kgs of weight in the last 2 months - ever since I quit smoking!!
So cheers and keep up the good habit of not lighting up!!

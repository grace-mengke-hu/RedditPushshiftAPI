Chain smoking at my home office. Replacement ideas?

I work from home with a work laptop and have computers in every room including the garage.  Since it's freezing here in Texas (don't judge.  50 degrees is damned cold to us Texans)  I smoke in the garage.  I do this while working and pretty much just chain smoke.  When I quit I'm going to need a replacement activity.  Can anyone provide some ideas?  I need a supplemental activity I can do at my desk/sofa/kitchen or where ever I'm working at the moment.  I know it would be better to work on eliminating the hand/mouth/inhale/exhale habit but I've tried and it just doesn't work for me.  Also the vape set ups I have just make me want a cig more.

I did it! I quit! Here's my story.

So after eight years, I can finally say I am 100% nicotine free. I started smoking cigarettes in college, and from there it took me four years to finally agree to switch to a vape when I began my first job after graduating college. 

The vape was good for a while, and it helped me get my fix, but it was just a replacement for cigarettes, and eventually became just as problematic. I needed to constantly vape, and I had the machine attached to my face nearly 24 hours a day, seven days a week. I would go crazy if I ran out of juice, or burnt out a coil. I was spending a massive amount of money on vape supplies. 

Eventually, I said enough was enough. 

I tried reading "The Easy Way" by Alan Carr, and that did absolutely nothing for me. Seriously, it did jack shit. I know some people swear by it, but it was ineffectual for me. 

In 2016, I quit my job. A few months after that, I went from using the vape to chewing nicotine gum. This replacement therapy felt like a significant improvement, but after nearly two years of using the Nicorette, it was becoming just as problematic as the vape and was once again merely a replacement. 

This year, I decided to make one more switch to the nicotine patch, and I was determined to follow the rules and quit when it was time to stop. I spent 12 weeks on the program, followed by two more weeks of 1 piece of gum per day, and finally, that was it. I haven't had any nicotine since. 

This entire process took me eight years. Eight freaking years. But now, I'm free. It has been two months, and I have zero cravings for nicotine.  

In conclusion: fuck nicotine.

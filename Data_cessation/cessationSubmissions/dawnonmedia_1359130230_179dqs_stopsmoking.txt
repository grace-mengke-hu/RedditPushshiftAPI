how i quit

i was a closet smoker for over 15 years and wanted to quit. being a hispanic female college student under the age of 30, making less than 30K per year-- i was definitely a target for tobacco companies. so i decided to do my [civic engagement project on tobacco marketing in low socio-economic ares] (http://www.activelifehq.org/sites/default/files/TobAdDisparityTrvsCty.pdf). since then some great changes have been made in travis county, less advertisements are seen in lower ses areas and the the presentation i gave for my course landed me my first job out of college in tobacco prevention. through our efforts we even helped fuel the legislation that mandates smoke free parks

it was pretty hard to quit because i always justified the behavior as "oh, i only do it socially" (read:DENIAL).
 
there is NOTHING beneficial about smoking and convincing yourself that it makes you feel good is nothing but a sham! it shortens your effing life and affects others around you. 2nd hand smoke kills more than 40K people each year. if that makes you feel good, you might want to get your head checked!! 
just sayin-- 
the worst are parents who expose their children to smoke and then wonder why they have asthma and other breathing and health issues. 
wake up and smell the bacon, folks! and stop obstructing others ability to smell the bacon too.

there is help out there when you are ready to quit killing yourself and others around you.

How did you get the ball rolling?

Hey all, smoker of 15 years here wanting to how you guys got started on your journey to quitting. I really really want to quit, I can feel everything that's happened to my body since I've started and I miss being fit. I still love smoking though, I don't know what it is exactly I just enjoy it, a lot.

So ya I'll get myself all psyched up to quit and then about an hour into it I'm off puffing away again. Every damn time. The longest I've gone on my own was 3 days with the patch. I think I'm scared of something, not sure what. I probably need more distractions or something, I really don't know.

Anyways what are your tips or tricks for getting over that initial fear and hesitance.

Today's the day.

I'm using Smoke Free and my Apple Watch'a Breathe app. This would be nearly the time I'd smoke a cigarette at lunch. I'm not going to today. Took my lunch early to change the routine, spent it with the app and breathing thingâ€¦it helps / hurts that I'm a little sick. Helps because smoking while sick is awful and I know that. But it hurts cause I'm trying to take deep breaths and I'm all congested from my sinuses down to my lungs and it's pretty discouraging. At any rate, wish me well. It's been 9 years since I made the woeful decision to start doing this to myself. Today I'm going to begin fixing that.

Quitting Cig /Weed / Vaping (Cold Turkey)

Been smoking cigarettes for about 4 years on and off. Started out smoking only when drinking. It wasn't until the last year or so that I began smoking sober and daily. But I've been smoking at least 5 days a week since Summer 2017, about 5-6 a day at least. Been vaping 16-25mg nicotine all day every day since January 2017.

Been smoking weed since 2012. Longest I went without weed was 6 months. 2nd longest was maybe a month. It makes me paranoid and gives me crazy social anxiety now.

I haven't smoked a cigarette in 2 days, however I vaped yesterday morning and smoked weed last night. I'm dropping them both today. How hard will this be? Will I have more withdrawal symptoms since I'm quitting 3 things at once?

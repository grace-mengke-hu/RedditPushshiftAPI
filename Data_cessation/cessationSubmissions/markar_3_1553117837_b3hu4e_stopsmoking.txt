When I look back I see how pointless was smoking

Hello people, I hope I find you smoke free for another day. And for those who smoked this doesn't mean that the effort is over. 
So I just completed 2 weeks of smoke free period and I realised that I could have done it earlier. Nicotine gums helped me mentally as a safety barrier for the cravings, but I can't believe two weekends with nightouts passed by without smoking. I feel like smoking was just an illusion. Coffee is fine without it, a drink is fine without it,partying is fine without it, it is totally fine not to smoke after eating. 
Every milestone I reach is getting me addicted in quitting smoking.
 I just hope that ten years of smoking didn't do that much of a damage. I regret all the pointless risk I put my self into. Don't overestimate the addiction people... Just try it for a few days, if you feel it is difficult you can still smoke the day after you try... then repeat until you realise that the addiction is not flawless. You just need xp points in quitting. 
The second cigarette of the day was my last one so far. I intend to keep it that way. If you feel you cant start the day without it do it during the day as I did.  And when you do ask your self... why do I do this to my self?

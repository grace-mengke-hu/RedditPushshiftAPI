42 WHOLE DANG DAYS!

Cold turkey! Super stoked about this. I'm traveling, so I'm not prone to smoke and I'll be at about 91 days by the time I get home. I can also run two miles without heaving and my lungs feel great. I'm starting to taste and smell better...I also go to bed earlier and have less anxiety. 

I should've quit 8 years ago!

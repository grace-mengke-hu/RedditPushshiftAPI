What is wrong with me?

Hey guys. Bit of a background story. I'm 27/m and have been smoking for the last 11 years. I started smoking 'properly' at 17, where I was buying packs. By 19, I was a 25 pack a day smoker. I thought I loved it when I was younger, and realise now that's not the case. It's disgusting and I actually have mild anxiety attacks when I think about how much its damaging my health, wealth and happiness. 


I have tried Allen Carr, twice! and don't know why I keep falling back into the trap. My wife smokes and doesn't want to stop, but I can't place my failure on her shoulders. I feel I'm intelligent enough, and pick things up quick. Why can't I comprehend this book and get it to help me? I tried reading the book and bought the audiobook too. 


Has anyone else had to try Allen Carr more than once? I feel like a failure and the anxiety is only getting worse as time goes by. 


I don't want to be 30 with health problems from smoking. It's not what I want, nor do I want my daughter to see me suffering from my own stupidity. Any suggestions would be great.

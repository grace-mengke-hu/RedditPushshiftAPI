The one thing preventing me from quitting.

Hey folks, been a lurker here for a while and I think sharing this will help ease the pain im going through by smoking.

I recently found out that Ive developed chronic sinusitis and I think smoking has a lot to do with it. Been a smoker for 5 years with the last one year being a 'smoke a pack every day' year. 

I think if not anything else, my health and respiratory condition is a good enough reason that I call it quits

HERES WHATS STOPPING ME THOUGH..
I absolutely have to smoke when I masturbate. I dont know if this is just a mental fixation or I just cant ejaculate without a smoke. Well technically I can ejaculate but it doesn't feel that good at all. 

These days after a single smoke, immediately 5 minutes after and lasting upto 6-7 hours, I get these nasty unbearable sinus headaches. I can totally quit smoking if it were not for my fapping habits. Does anybody else have this problem??? 
I will never stop jerking off, that is just a non-option for me. But I need to quit smoking. PLease help!

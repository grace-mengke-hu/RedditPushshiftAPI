Just found out about this sub

Hey guys, my name's Tyler, been smoking for a little over a year, not long, but I really want to quit. I do like smoking, but I know it's bad for me, and the main reason is my girlfriend, she says she doesn't care, but I know she would rather me not smoke. And she is the best thing to happen to me, I can't lose her. So here's my dilemma, I told her I'd stop new years, for her, and she was so excited, and I did quit, for like a day (big for me. Considering I smoke about 5-10 a day) but the next morning I immediately went back to it. The car is what kills me, every single time I get in my car I feel like I have to smoke, it's become habit. So she thinks I have quit, when I really haven't, so I'm digging myself a big hole. I'm not looking for sympathy, I would just like some advice from you guys about methods you use to milk the urge to smoke. For me, it's not stress that brings it on, it's the feeling of smoking, I like to smoke, in my mind, I feel cool. So thanks for those who read this, I appreciate any and all help you can give me.

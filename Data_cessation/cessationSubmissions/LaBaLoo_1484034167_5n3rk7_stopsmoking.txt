Firmly Staking My "NonSmoking" Claim!

I am almost to 12 days (a few more hours!), and these past two days have been really tough!  It's not so much cravings as this "craziness" that tells me to buy a pack of smokes or bum a smoke from work-mate.  I literally DO NOT want to smoke, have all of my conscious thinking going to "I am a nonsmoker"; "Nonsmokers do not smoke"; "I do not smoke"; "NOPE (Not One Puff Ever!!)" -- and, yet, find myself somehow wanting to smoke.  I guess it's a craving, but it's more like a psychological pull -- a pull I am very actively resisting!

I know I say it all the time, but I am SO, SO grateful for this subreddit.  I came here specifically to post about my struggle tonight, and I immediately found several posts that literally GAVE ME strength and courage and support.  It's this huge relief when that happens, and I deeply appreciate each and every person that posts or comments here!  

Anyway, tonight is tough, but I will get through to 12 days!  Everyone says the first few weeks are the toughest!  Well, I am almost to two weeks (three more days!!) and I'm going to stay strong and not smoke no matter what!!

Thank you /r/stopsmoking!

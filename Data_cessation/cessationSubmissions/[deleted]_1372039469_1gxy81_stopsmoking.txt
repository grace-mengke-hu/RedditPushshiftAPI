Day 1, ___ days to go.

I haven't had a cigarette since yesterday afternoon, and I've had plenty of opportunities to buy more - I've forced myself to choose not to do so. I've been chewing gum when I get cravings.

Also, I set up an appointment to get some medicine for quitting. Should I go that route right away or keep trying cold turkey?

I can do this

Today would technically be day 3 but at the end of day 1, I smoked one of my boyfriend's cigarettes. I feel incredibly empty and depressed without smoking. I know I can do it. I don't want to smoke anymore.. but I do at the same time. I just want to lay in bed and eat all day to fill this void. I'm not, of course. I work full time and I went to yoga last night. And while I am depressed, I am proud of myself. I've never really even tried to quit before. I thought of it as this impossible feat. But I've been talking about quitting for weeks.. and the other day I just decided I wasn't going to buy another pack. And I got really excited about being a non-smoker.. and I still am, but I am feeling very gloomy right now. Sorry for the rant. I just need a bit of encouragement.

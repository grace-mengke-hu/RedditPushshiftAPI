Day 4 - Getting really, really tired

I just woke up on day 4 and I immediately noticed I'm getting really tired of the daily fight. Again I immediately wanted to smoke when I got up (didn't, eating breakfast in stead now), but the nicotine voice is getting louder. 

I definitely do NOT want to give up, since I've been doing so well for three days. But I do notice my head is just getting insanely tired of it all. Does this pass? Is this the worst day or does it get worse?

Only smoke 3 cigs a day, still can't quit, help?

I've only been smoking about 3 years. I smoke about 3-4 cigarettes a day, nothing crazy. Usually on my way to work, at lunch, and on my way home, if it's been a long day I'll smoke one last time while home. 

I've tried quitting cold turkey a few times but don't last more than 3 days. I've tried easing myself off, but that never last. 

I really feel it's more of a habit thing for me at this point, but I do definitely crave them when it's my usual "time".

I'm apprehensive of trying quitting aids like gum or patches because I don't smoke THAT much to start with. 

I tried to vape, didn't even last a day. I didn't get the throat hit, and it just felt wrong/didn't help with the craving. 

Is there anything I can try to help get me to stop?

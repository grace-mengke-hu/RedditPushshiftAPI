Quitting... What do I do on my lunch break?

So I'm on day 1, and today at work I didn't take my breakfast or lunch breaks because I didn't want to be tempted into having a cigarette. I think I'll do this for the next few days until I can trust myself. But here's my problem:

I used to just go outside to the smokers' area and smoke/drink coffee the entire time (I get one 10 minute break and one 30 minute break). I have only ever sat in the break room a couple of times, and I didn't like it. I work in a 99% female workplace, and all they do in the break room is gossip, talk about sales on at various shops, kiss up to the boss, or just basically talking about things I am REALLY not interested in. I'm a fairly quiet girl, and I don't like talking about crap. On the other hand, the break room is usually pretty crowded and I hate that.

So any suggestions? Should I just force myself to start using the break room?

Edit: I should add that I'm not against having a chat - when I used to go outside I was always chatting with the other smokers, for some reason we actually had interesting conversations. It's just a totally different environment in the break room.

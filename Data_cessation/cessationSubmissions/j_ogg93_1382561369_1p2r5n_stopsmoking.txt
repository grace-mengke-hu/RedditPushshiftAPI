It's my birthday!

Today happens to be my 20th birthday, and it is also my 30th day of being smoke-free! It feels awesome to come this far. My friend sent me this the other day as a sign of encouragement, and I'd like to pass it on to those who have yet to see it: [http://imgur.com/r/GetMotivated/zTc0MFR]

Stay positive, guys. Fuck the zero!

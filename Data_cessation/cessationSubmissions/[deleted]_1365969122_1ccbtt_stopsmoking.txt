My 16 year old friend, who's a girl, smokes weed everyday. Help me?

All of her friends smoke she said she's a stoner and her bf smokes weed with her everyday, she's my ex. She keeps telling me she smokes because she wants to not and not because she has problems and stuff. She smokes everyday, can anybody help me? I tried convicting her but she says weed doesn't have any bad effects. Help me guys, everyone tells me I shouldn't do anything about it. Btw my friend hates me a lot now because I've tried many things.

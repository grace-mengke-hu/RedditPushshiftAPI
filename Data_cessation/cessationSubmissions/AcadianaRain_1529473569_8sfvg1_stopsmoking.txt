So you want to know the benefits of quitting?

This is my third (and final) time quitting. I just wanted all you new quitters to realize something. If you could feel the way you will feel in two months from the day you quit, you would wonder why you ever started.
It's like being a young kid again; everything and I mean everything is better. Guys, I'm not a doctor or anything like that. But if you want food and drinks (yes even alcoholic ones) to taste better, sex to feel better, energy to be higher, motivation to skyrocket, depression to go away, insecurity and neediness to subside and your body and face to be more attractive, QUIT SMOKING!!

Hey, and one other thing? If you want to stop smoking for good and not miss it, STOP comparing yourself to other people!

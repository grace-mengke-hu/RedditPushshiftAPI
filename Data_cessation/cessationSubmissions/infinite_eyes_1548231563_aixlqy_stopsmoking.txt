Three weeks quit! Experiences with rapid weight gain, bloating, and constipation?

I feel amazing overall, and am very happy to be quit after 12 years as a heavy smoker.  I'm also decently fit and have been going to the gym, eating lots of veggies,  drinking heaps of water and tea.  I am gaining some weight,  and am also pretty bloated and constipated which I'm trying to address with just fibre and water.  

What are other nonsmokers' experiences with post-quit weight gain,  and what did you do to address it? Is it just my metabolism adjusting? And anyone else struggle with bloating and constipation?

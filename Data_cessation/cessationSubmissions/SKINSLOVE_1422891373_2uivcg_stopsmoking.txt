Day 5

This is the longest I've stayed quit in a long time!  I slipped up the other day and smoked 2 cigs but put them both out halfway and tossed the rest of the new pack.  While drinking last night I chain vaped my ecig but felt like I couldn't get my fix anyways, so I'm going to try not to lean on that too much either. My temper has been a bit short but I keep telling myself that all this is just the poison leaving my body. Thanks everyone for the support its helped a ton!

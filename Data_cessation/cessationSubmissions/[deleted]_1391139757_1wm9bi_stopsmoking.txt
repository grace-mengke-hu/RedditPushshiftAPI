Caved out of curiosity.

Bored one day before work (had a 2hr gap to do whatever). So I decided to hop into work before it opens and just study.

Unfortunately, there is a liquor store literally across the street from work, and the owner knows me from all the tines I've bought cigarettes there... 

Ended up buying a single CIG (not many stores do that) and smoked.

Initially, it wasn't bad, I was just curious to see if I was missing it after ~2 months of not smoking. 

But, a couple hours later, while talking to a customer, my throat felt like it closed for a second, and gave that choking feeling. Worst feeling ever.

TL;DR: smoked a cigarette after 2 months of nonsmoking, big regret

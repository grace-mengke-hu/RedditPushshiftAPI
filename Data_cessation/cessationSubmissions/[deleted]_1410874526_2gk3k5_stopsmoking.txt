Confession: I think that replacing smoking with vaping is not really quitting

....I think it is more swapping one habit for another. I see people talking about it sometimes on reddit and sometimes I even see people *recommending* that someone swap to vaping when they express a desire to quit. This kinda drives me nuts.

I understand that there is no SMOKE involved which makes vaping less harmful, but there is still nicotine (almost 99% of the time I have found.. a bit anecdotal I guess). 

I also may be a bit biased as quitting cold turkey was strangely almost easy for me.


Thoughts?

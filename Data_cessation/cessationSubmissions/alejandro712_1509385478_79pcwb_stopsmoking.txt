Quitting nic for good- about 2 weeks in cold turkey- when do the cravings stop?

I smoked cigarettes for about 2-3 years then swtiched to e cigarettes and used for another 5. Its been a bit over two weeks (quit the 12th or 13th) since I went cold turkey. Was on the equivalent of 2 packs a day (40mg of nicotine approx per day). When does the cravings stop? Every time I see or smell a cigarette or a vape my body goes wild. I swear the cravings have honestly gotten worse in the past couple of weeks. Mornings are a nightmare- having to drink so much tea and caffeine to get through. After a meal my body goes wild. What was your experience with cold turkey? When did you feel "normal" again?

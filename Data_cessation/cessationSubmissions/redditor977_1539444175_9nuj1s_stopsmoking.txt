Day 1, what’s up with this hyper-energetic body?

Hi, it’s my first day of quitting. I feel amazing and I feel like I can run up and down the stairs a hundred times. I feel fidgety sitting at the library and I always want to take a walk. Was this my normal state? Why do I suddenly feel more energetic? I suppose it’s because of oxygen being consumed more effectively but I did not expect such a difference. Thanks in advance.

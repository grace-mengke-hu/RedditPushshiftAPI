3 Weeks!

And still feeling great. I quit cold turkey and because I was absolutely 100% done smoking and ready to take my life back, it was amazingly easier than I ever thought it would be. I am a bit nervous moving forward though, I travel for business which is the biggest trigger I have. My first trip since I quit is on Monday to Portland, OR. I think I'll be alright though. 

Stay strong friends!!

I literally cannot function to work while quitting. Really struggling, might smoke and regroup with what I've learned this failure. Help!

Today is supposed to be Day 1 smoke free. I say supposed because I'm willing to bet that I won't last the day... I think my mistake is this is my first real attempt after 10 years smoking and after doing really well to cut down from 15+ per day to 5-8 per day, I'm attempting to go cold turkey for the rest of it. I might have to head to get some patches or gum tomorrow, but I digress...

I literally cannot function. I've got a ton of paperwork to do, along with some articles to write and some university work to crack on with, yet I cannot concentrate on fucking anything. I just cannot do it. I just want to smoke. I just need to smoke. I can't do a goddamn thing; smoking, and the fact I can't do it, is all I'm thinking about. I've got the usual anxious, nerves, what not. I thought that quitting would be like cutting down -- you want a cigarette for a few minutes, then it goes away and you carry on. I've been in a constate state of craving for about the last six hours. It's fucking hell. 

I don't want to fail. I can't fail; I need to be smoke free by June, as I've got a great gig lined up for the summer, but it's in a strictly smoke free environment. But the problem is that I can't put my life on hold to become smoke free...

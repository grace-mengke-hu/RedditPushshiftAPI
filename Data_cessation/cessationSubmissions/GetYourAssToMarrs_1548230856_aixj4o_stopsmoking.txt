All this phlegm..

Went cold turkey 12 days ago. Pack a day smoker for 30 yrs straight without a break.

The constant coughing up/snorting out phlegm has really kicked up a notch and is preventing me from work/sleep.  When I was smoking I hardly coughed at all. 

Anybody else experienced this? Any idea when it gets better? Any tips? 

Stay strong ðŸ’ª

Why I quit - a reminder to myself for times to come

* I've been smoking for 20+ years now. 
* I'm getting married soon and don't want to be one of those guys that lies to their wives about smoking. I've always found it sad seeing grown men lie and make up stories to sneak away for a smoke.
* I dont want my wife to lose me to cancer because of smoking. It would devastate her and I would feel such remorse that I could have avoided that.
* Smoking has made me do stupid and selfish things - all because of the urge to fulfill a craving. It has controlled and defined entire weekends with family all based on whether I can smoke there or not.
* Smoking has taken up a ridiculous amount of time in my day - not just the smoking but all the related activities - buying smokes, coffee breaks, walking to a smoking area to smoke. Making friends wait in the car while I smoke. Freezing your nuts off in the winter while you smoke.
* My car smells like an ashtray.
* ED - I've had a tougher time staying hard for years now. The last time I quit - within a few days I was waking up with boners again. After 10 days of no smoking and no fapping, I woke up to a wet dream.
* I often wake up in the middle of the night scared shitless. Why am I smoking? There is no real pleasure to it and yet I'm killing myself for the chance to do it.
* I'm also ashamed of the addiction. As one who practices meditation and yoga, the addiction was the worst possible thing I could do to my mind and body - completely the antithesis of what I believe in.
* The shame of people seeing me smoke - everytime I light one I hope there's no nephews or neices or extended family that see me. How can I go through life doing something that I'm ashamed of.
* Smoking is the one thing I've done the longest in my life. Its time to replace that with more positive habits that don't incur shame and self hate.

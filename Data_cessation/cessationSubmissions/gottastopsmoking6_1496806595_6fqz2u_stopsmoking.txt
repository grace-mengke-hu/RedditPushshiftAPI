Time to quit. Help appreciated (:

I've been smoking two years. I smoke anywhere from 10-20 or more. I've always smoked non filtered and have been rolling my own for a while now.
Last time I quit I went 6 days without. I would cough until I threw up multiple times a day. I would wake up in a cold sweat two or more times per night and have to change the sheets.
Should I quit cold turkey or slowly stop smoking?
Thanks for the help in advance! : D

really stressed

I have officially been smoke free since nov. 27th, but it is getting really hard again about week 5. I have noticed I am extremely irritable, and jaw pain is intense, as well as bouts of insomnia. I have been craving about a good bit of the day thinking about smoking. I am not going to, but i am really at the point where I am clenching my jaw so as to resist the urge. Is this a known time where it kicks back up? I heard 3 months really is the amount of time, and it also gets hard around then to. What can I expect? When does it get better when does it get worse? could I be further along then I thought? Really waiting for that window to be open again

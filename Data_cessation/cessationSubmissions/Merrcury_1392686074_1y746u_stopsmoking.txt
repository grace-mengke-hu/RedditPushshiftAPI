Smoking and writing.

I can't make sense of it. Every time I sit down to write, I can't concentrate without chain smoking. Any ideas on how to curb the habit while still writing?

 So far, I'm smoking a pack on weekends to flush out all the clogs of ideas. I can stand monotony and easy breathing during the week. I don't want to exorcise ALL my demons, though, ya know?

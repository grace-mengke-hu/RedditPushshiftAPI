I smoked after almost completing a week

And it was awful and just felt wrong. I took a cigarette and rolled three of my own, because I roll my own cigarettes which is the habit I miss the most, but it was disgusting. The fact I went back to smoke made me realise I actually do not like it at all, and then the realisation of the amount of people I let down by doing it.

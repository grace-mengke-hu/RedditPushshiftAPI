Just hit 7 days of no smoking.

Hi all, decided to quit a week ago for many reasons! Just hit the week milestone and it's going well. Been lurking on this sub since the day I threw my packet away - have to admit I did buy a vape but I thought I'd challenge myself and get the weakest strength so going from smoking 20-30 a day to this is still pretty frustrating (feels like it anyway) but I'm determined to get used to it then eventually ditch the vape altogether.

Did try going cold turkey a year or so ago and completely failed within a couple of days so this is a record for me!

Just thought I'd say hi :)

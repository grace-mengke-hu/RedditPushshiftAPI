Quitting Cold Turkey Today

I need moral support and encouragement today, Day 1 of my quit smoking journey.  

I plan to keep busy to keep my mind off of cigarettes and to avoid thinking, which usually triggers smoking.  I also plan to  do some mindfulness meditation throughout the day.

Sound like a plan?

Anyone care to join me?

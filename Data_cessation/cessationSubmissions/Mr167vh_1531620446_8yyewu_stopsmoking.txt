Harder than I ever thought

Hi all , 
I'm 24 and have been a heavy smoker since about 16 years old .
I "quit" smoking cold turkey with no NRTs after reading Allen carr's book and only made it till the evening on my first day before I had a panic attack and lit one , the next 2 days I kept slipping up again and again having a few periodically over the weekend.  
The physical side I could handle pretty well especially at work while I was very busy and distracted , then became very depressed and almost suicidal it was horrid and found it a mission to even do basic mental tasks,  it almost felt like I was stoned.
My partner gave up the same time as me and hasn't had a single cigarette until I caved today , that made my feel like a awful partner and father ( we have a 1 yr old son,  which is one of my strong reasons to stop for good)

I'm open to and wisdom or advice for my second try tommorow , I'm thinking to give the nicotine spray or patches a go , although Allen Carrs book says not too ?

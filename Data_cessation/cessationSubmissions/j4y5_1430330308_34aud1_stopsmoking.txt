30 Days

If I can do it... You can too! Thanks so much people of this great subreddit, I do not know what I would of done without the daily front page reminders I receive from all of you wonderful human beings! 

For me it has been unsalted sunflower seeds, sugar-free gum (the non-nicotine stuff) and the periodic loud vocal outburst, sounding like a loonie because of a pang I am going through, that has helped me along my journey. 

To our recovery and one more day.

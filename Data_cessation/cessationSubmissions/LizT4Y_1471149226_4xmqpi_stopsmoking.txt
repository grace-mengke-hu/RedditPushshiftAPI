How to help my (27F) boyfriend (26M) stop smoking?

My boyfriend of 2.5 years had been a "social smoker" for long enough I think it's actually an addiction. I myself am not a smoker. I want to help him quit. He's said he wants to quit, but he's also started to dabble in dipping. My question is how can I help encourage him to quit and how to support him, without coming off as a nag/pandering to him/giving him an ultimatum? I appreciate any and all advice.

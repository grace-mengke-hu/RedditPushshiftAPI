Stomach ache?

Yus! Day 4 of my new freedom (after smoking 20cig/day for 8 years) and i‘m actually enjoying it. I have so much energy, no more headache and I love how much i already hate the smell of cigarettes. But: Since day 2 I am struggling with stomach ache. Has anyone experienced this as well after quitting? Because I read about several other things but never heard of stomach troubles. 

Anyways! Keep up guys! It‘s awesome on the smoke-free-side!

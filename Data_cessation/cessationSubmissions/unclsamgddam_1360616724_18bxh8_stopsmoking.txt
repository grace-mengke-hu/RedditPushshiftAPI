633 Days. You all helped me so much, thanks!

The last time I posted was Day 12. http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/h9ezd/day_12_has_been_the_gnarliest_but_i_survived/

Today is Day 633. April 29th will mark two years with no smoking. I gotta give credit to this subreddit. Knowing there was a community of people going through the same issues helped me build the strength to quit once and for all. 

To those of you at the beginning of your journey, stick it out. Turn to this subreddit for rants until you get through the thick of it. Life is so much better on the other side. I have cravings here and there, but it's nothing I can't manage. 

Benefits I've noticed: 
- Attracting more attractive ladies (because I don't smell)
- Saved THOUSANDS of dollars. 
- Don't regularly run, but when I do I can go miles
- Generally happier, more positive outlook 
- Learning to confront problems head on, instead of retreating to my smokes
- Learned new (and more effective) lines to meet new people. No more, "Do you have a smoke?"
- No more hiding my habit from my parents, co-workers, etc. 
- Shortened my workday by 2 hours, those 15 minute smoke breaks add up. 
- Dentist was like: "Yeah dude, shits awesome up in yo mouth"
- Enhanced taste, which has actually led me to eat healthier.
- You are more confident in tackling future challenges because you did one of the hardest things: quitting smoking!
- I am better at moderating all my bad habits now. 

Here's to you r/stopsmoking and all the folks in their first few weeks. I wish you all the best!

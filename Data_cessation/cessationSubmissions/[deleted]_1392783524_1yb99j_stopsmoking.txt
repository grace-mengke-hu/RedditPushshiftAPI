Is vaping considered cheating?

It's been exactly one week since I've had my last actual cigarette and I feel great. But naturally I still get the urge to smoke so I've been getting by on those disposable e-cigs, like Blu or Mistic. 

They were ok, but didn't satisfy my craving so I finally decided to go all in today and bought a vape starter kit and some juice. The thing is I feel like I haven't actually "quit" because I'm still addicted to nicotine, I'm just receiving it through a different delivery method now. 

Needless to say it's left me feeling a bit conflicted. Any thoughts about it would be appreciated.

Time to quit.

I’m 24. Been smoking since 16. I am also a recovering drug addict and alcoholic. Been clean and sober 8 months and I think its time to try and quit smoking. 

I haven’t attempted to quit in years and I’ve been putting it off because there’s no way I could quit while drinking and doing drugs. The two always went together.

However, now that I’m sober I wanna quit but fuck I’m scared. Cigs are 13$ where I’m at. I’m sick of the smell, the dry mouth, The needing to smoke when I’m somewhere I cant, etc. 

BUT FUCK I AM SCARED!! They’re like my best friends. They were with me through everything. The longest I’ve gone lately is 10 days when I was in jail. I shouldve stayed stopped but no way I was getting out of jail and not smoking. Lol. 

Anyways, I got a pack and a half left so I’m gonna smoke them and go from there I guess.

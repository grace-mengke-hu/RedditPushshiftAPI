Just found you guys. Last cigg was on the 14th.

Anyways, cutting down for health mostly and also money. Realized i was contributing a huge amount of my monthly budget to fuckin cancerous ciggy butt breath.

I haven't actually bought ciggs since last friday, but i bummed a few through to sunday and had none Monday and Tuesday but hung out with a friend and had 2 on wednesday...

Anyways wish me lucks

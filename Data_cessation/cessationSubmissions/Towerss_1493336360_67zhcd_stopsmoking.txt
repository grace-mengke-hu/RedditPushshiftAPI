Be aware smoking causes depression, stress, anxiety and is the leading cause of erectile dysfunction in young men.

After I started again I got really fucked up. I got nervous and started stuttering all the time, anxiety followed me around.

7 days quit and I feel amazing, I'm back in control. Hope more people realize smoke might be whats making their life shitty

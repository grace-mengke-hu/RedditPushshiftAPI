Got offered a cigarette by a co-worker and said no!

We were both out getting coffee and normally we would have a cigarette with our coffee before going back to the office. Instead I sat and drank my coffee while he had a cigarette with his. The smell actually made me feel slightly ill! Day 5 and going strong!

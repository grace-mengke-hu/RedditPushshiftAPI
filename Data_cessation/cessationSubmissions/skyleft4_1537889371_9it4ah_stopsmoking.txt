Day 4!!

Day 4 without cigarettes and no alcohol (had to cut that one for now too so I wouldn’t have bad cravings). 
So far I noticed my husband (he’s a smoker) smells like my grandma lol but even though he smokes on the patio and sometimes I can smell, I still don’t crave enough to feel like having one. 

A high school friend of mine died last Monday, his habits were just like mine, drinking 3-4/week, smoking since teen years, minimum to average exercising, we both 29 years old and well, he died of a heart attack. He didn’t have any history of heart issues. 
That’s when I decided I needed to change some things in my life. It shocked me. 
So that is motivation enough for me (FOR NOW AT LEAST) to not pick up a cigarette. 
I was already thinking about quitting. I got to a point that I wouldn’t even bring cigarettes with me when leaving the house (surprisingly didn’t even think about it) because I was embarrassed of smoking outside. Where I live (socal) not many people smoke. Every time I saw women my age smoking I felt disgusted (I know, weird) so I didn’t wanna feel the same way by other people. That helps motivate me too. 

Alsooooo. I feel more energy, not sure if is related, or I’m just trying to stay busy, but I feel a lot more motivated to do stuff, workout, walk around, etc 
Lol

Good luck everyone! We can do it 💪🏻

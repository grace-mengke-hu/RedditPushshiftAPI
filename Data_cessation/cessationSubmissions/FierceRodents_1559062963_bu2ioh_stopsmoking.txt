Can't stop smelling my hair

I washed my hair this morning with a new shampoo, and it still smells amazing.
I'm so used to every other smell getting swallowed by the smoke, that now every time I shake my head I'm amazed at how good it smells.

Just a small reminder of why I'm quitting. Right now it feels like my hair, my skin, everything is new.

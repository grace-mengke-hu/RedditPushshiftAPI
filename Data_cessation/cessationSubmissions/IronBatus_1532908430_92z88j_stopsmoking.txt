I need help. Hoping to find it here.

I apologize in advance, first post, can't format, not an English student. Just trying to reach out for help. 

I want to quit so bad. I'm on my second vape thing and it's not cutting it. My girlfriend hates that I smoke on top of many other things about me. I don't have any friends left around here and the ones that are long distance are busy with their own lives. 

I hate that I stink. I hate my smile. I hate that my girlfriend never wants to kiss me. Yet when things get tense or awkward or even when they're fine I still find myself running outside and sucking down 3 or 4 or more back to back. I'm 30, and I've been a smoker longer than I've been a non smoker. I've tried gums and patches and replacements. I know at the end of the day it's mostly mental, but my mind always says fuck it or something to the like. 


I'm coming here begging for help. Someone to reach out to me. Someone to chat with, text, email, call, anything. Instead of going outside I can go in the other room and talk until the crave subsides. I'm in therapy now for other reasons but it feels like I'm just paying someone to talk to me, which is taking a big blow at my self esteem. I'm begging you guys for help. Please message me. Please send me words of encouragement. Remind me I'm not a waste of life. Throw your problems at me to help distract me. I'm a good listener though I do tend to throw my problems in even when trying to focus on someone else's. 

I know I'm rambling now. Please help me stay strong. I'm making a promise to myself that after dinner I'm having my last one and throwing away the rest. I can be a really good friend in return I just feel hopeless as this is like the millionth time I'm trying to quit but I can never seem to make it through the day. Im home from work for the next two weeks waiting for surgery so I feel it's a good excuse to lock myself into my non smoking household and try and force myself to do this.

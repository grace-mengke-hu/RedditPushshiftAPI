Day 15 - Passed a milestone, but now I have a bad cough

Checking in again, it has been two weeks and I think the nicotine withdrawal is now behind me. I also passed a major milestone in that I drank and partied with friends for three days straight this weekend (Toronto Gay Pride) and didn't smoke once. 

However, I seem to have developed a nasty, gunky cough which is really bothering me. I know that as my lungs heal, I can expect to cough up a lot of mucous, but this is effecting my breathing and my sleep really badly. I wonder if anyone has experience with this, and could offer any remedies?

Thanks

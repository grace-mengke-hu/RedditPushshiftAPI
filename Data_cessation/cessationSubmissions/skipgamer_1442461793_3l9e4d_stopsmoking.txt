things taste weird

I had some spaghetti bolognese the other day, something about the herbs I put in tasted different (basil oregano mostly), and not just a little bit, a whole heap too.

Also had some apricot chicken, which I normally have no problem with... That tasted Really weird.

Apart from that I feel healthier, I love looking at my fingers and not seeing that horrible yellow stain between the index and middle! My cardio hasn't noticeably improved yet, but here's to hoping as time goes on.

Best of luck everyone else!

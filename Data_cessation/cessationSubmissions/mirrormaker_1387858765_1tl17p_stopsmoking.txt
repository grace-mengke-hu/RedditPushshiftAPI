Heard a simple piece of advice today, wanted to share it with you

I've heard the phrase "one day at a time" countless times when it comes to addiction, but until I decided to really work at quitting smoking it never meant anything to me. "One day at a time" still really doesn't mean a lot to me, just because the saying itself has become a banal platitude for me. It's like telling me to "keep my head up," it just doesn't mean anything.

But this morning I was driving much earlier than I usually do and was able to hear Don Imus on the radio talking off handedly about his past alcohol abuse. He said basically the same thing as "one day at a time", but in a different enough of a way that it made the saying mean so much more to me than it ever had before. I'm going to paraphrase it here, and replace "drinking" with "smoking" because it applies equally well:

**"If you told me 27 years ago that I would have to quit smoking for the rest of my life, I would have known that I would never have been able to do it, but if you told me that I would have to quit smoking just for today, that would be easier. I don't have to quit smoking forever. I just have to quit smoking today."**

I know this is a common thought process and I'm certainly not the first person to share this sentiment, but I found this particular phrasing of the sentiment to be particularly effective. I know it will help me in the coming weeks, and I hope it helps others out there who are in their first week.

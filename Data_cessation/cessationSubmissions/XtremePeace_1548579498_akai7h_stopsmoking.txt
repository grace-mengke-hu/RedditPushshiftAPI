On my second day cold turkey, wanted to share my sensations

27M been smoking since 18. I feel like the effects are pretty curious and like weird mental creations.

I feel like my mind is rougher than usual. My thoughts all seem blunt, plain, vulgar, ignorant, annoyed. I feel more ignorant in mental attitude than I know myself to be. 

Earlier yesterday and today felt like muscles in the foreheard and temples were clenching inside and that I am not wearing a helmet that I otherwise would, so feeling like a reflex touch of a helmet on my skin. The muscle tension feel like they have little hands open and close craving nicotine. I feel some tension around the shoulders in the back and up on the neck aswel. Usually feel it on my mandibule aswel but it drewback this time.

I have tried quitting before and these effects are like old acquaintaces or enemies I had so they don't surprise, awe and overwhelm. It's actually like a pleasant pain to go throught them like a boxing match victory. I will win because this was a decision mandated by my rational mind down to my will and my body. My mind is supplying with understanding, guiding and my will is taking rulling over the rebellious parts of my body and mind.

So, I'm getting wisdom teeth out on thursday, I'm planning on quitting and haven't told a soul my plan

Every time I try and I tell people that I'm stopping they take it as a joke. I'm taking the few days I will be miserable from the teeth to start a s a boost towards quitting. Any suggestions or advice or anything to help would be appreciated

I think I’ll hit 5 weeks and try not to count the days as much.

I’m NEARLY at four weeks - I’m thirty days in... This is no more productive than when I smoked and I constantly counted the amount of cigarettes I was smoking and felt terrible if I smoked more than four a day. 

Feeling a lot less tense and urges above have ceased loads. Takes a few weeks to really start to see any benefits though. Exercise is good but getting outside for an hour or so even after work/gym is really good for routine and fitness plus it knocks you out a bit (try walking around green spaces). 

Do miss a roll-up though. Five weeks this Sunday. I usually hit around 3 months then seemingly out of nowhere I’ve a roll-up in hand. Will at the very least try and get to five months then twelve.

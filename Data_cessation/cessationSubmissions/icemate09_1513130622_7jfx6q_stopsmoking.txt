Another try and anxiety is just through the roof.

I'm 27 and have been smoking on and off for about 5 years. I quit for a solid year and went back because the person I was dating smoked and it was just so easy to fall back into it. It isn't a good excuse, but I'm just trying to get back on the horse again now a year later.

The thing is I have pretty bad anxiety and I'm all freaked out that I'm already dying of something. Does anyone else have this sort of anxiety when quitting? I was already clearing out some awful phlegm and my throat was already irritated before quitting so I'm just worried I'm already screwed. 

I know these symptoms are all relatively normal especially during winter and if things don't go away I can always see a doctor and it always gets worse before it gets better while quitting... but I can't help just feeling anxiety left right and centre about everything.

Does anyone have tips on how they manage this sort of thing?

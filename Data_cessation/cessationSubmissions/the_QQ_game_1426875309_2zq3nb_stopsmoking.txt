New method...

I would like to introduce a new method for quitting smoking: get sick immediately after you decide to quit. You'll notice your cravings become edged out by your feeling miserable because you're ill. Your irritability will be completely rational as you have a constant feeling of unease.. because you're sick. Trouble sleeping? Makes sense. 

Kind of a joke.. kind of not. I'm finding some benefit to this coincidental illness and my first days of quitting. Smoking seems especially disgusting to me as I know it's all going to collect in my sinuses.

Happy quitting!

I have to reset my flair and I'm super bummed

Dammit. I'm so upset with myself. I was doing so good, and I was feeling so much better! 

How do you guys get through super emotional times? I have got over the trigger of boredom but apparently not the trigger of crying. Fuck fuck fuckity fuck fuck! Sorry for the swearing.

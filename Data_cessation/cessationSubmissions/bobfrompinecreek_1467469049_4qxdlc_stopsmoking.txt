Relapsed from a 5 year hiatus just to say i quit smoking twice

First quit on November 13th 2011, just started smoking again June 2016 due to some woman induced stress, and had my last cigarette July 1st, 2016. 

Already through the first 24 hours and it's all gravy from here.

Having trouble quitting? Google Allen Carr Easy Method (hour long video that encourages you to smoke while watching - this is how i quit cold turkey the first time. TRUST ME on this)

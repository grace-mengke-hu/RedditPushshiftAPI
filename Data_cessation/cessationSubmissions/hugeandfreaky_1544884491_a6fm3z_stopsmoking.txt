You guys ever find yourself having to convince your brain?

Hi all, you lovely people here have been really helpful to me and I'm currently 2 months and 22 days smoke free after about 6 years of smoking. I've been having these almost day-long cravings for the past week or so.

I find myself constantly coming up with arguments followed by counter-arguments inside my head. It's a big, day-long debate (whenever I'm not occupied with something else). It usually comes down to me reminding myself why I quit in the first place, and a little further convincing. It started happening sometime around last week, the first 2 months and 2 weeks were quite easy this time, mainly because I was living a lot more isolated, I think.

I was just wondering if this is something common or am i slowly losing my sanity? Thanks in advance.

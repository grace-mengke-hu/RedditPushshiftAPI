Day 1

I fucked up.

I'd been doing so well. 8 days I believe...then went on a mad bender and have been smoking like a fiend for 6 weeks straight.

I was embarrassed even to come to this group and share what I'd done...'here he is again just falling off the wagon again...he'll never get his shit together...' 

2 weeks ago I learned that a friend in her forties has cancer. Bad.  Then I really started to smoke heavy.  Late. First thing.  I had a constant head ache. The uneasiness and storm in my mind was deafening.

Today I said no more.

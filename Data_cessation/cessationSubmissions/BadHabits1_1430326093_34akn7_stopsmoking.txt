How does cutting nicotine work?

Hi Reddit,

I was wondering how does your body and brain work when cutting nicotine? I was a constant smoker (~10 cigarettes a day) for 7 years and maybe a month ago I decided to quit cigarettes. Now, my question is that how does cutting NICOTINE (not cigarettes) work is because I am a daily weed smoker as well and joints include tobacco. It kinda ends up that I still smoke half a cigarette worth of tobacco every day.

Now, I hadn't had much trouble without smoking normal cigarettes at all for the past month, can it be that my daily dose of nicotine from joints help me?

I like to think that from discipline perspective it was still all me and this really motivates me to keep going this way. Basically, my question is: have I felt what i means to quit smoking or does that daily little dose of nicotine from joints help me big time?

P.S. I know some of you may think that quitting one without the other may be dumb, but I am happy that I smoke a lot less at least :)

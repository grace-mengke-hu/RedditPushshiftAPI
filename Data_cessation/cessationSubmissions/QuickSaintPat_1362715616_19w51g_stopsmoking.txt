What are the effects of smoking on pregnancy?

My girlfriend plans to quit smoking when she is pregnant. But I want her to stop before we even start trying for a kid. This is a few years into the future by the way. What can I tell her to get her to stop smoking before getting pregnant? All I can find on the internet are a few points about birth defects.

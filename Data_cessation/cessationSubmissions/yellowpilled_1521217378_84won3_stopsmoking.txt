Anybody else extremely disgusted by smokers after quitting?

Hey,

just wanted to ask you if you feel the same disgust when around people who smoke. I don't want to sound ignorant from my new moral high ground as a non-smoker but I can't believe this is what my non-smoking friends had to endure. Holy shit is the smell disgusting. Thinking back about the people I blew smoke in their face I feel so disgusted with myself

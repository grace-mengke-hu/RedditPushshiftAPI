A simple guide to quitting smoking - Do this 1 minute experiment to see the illusion smoking gives you.

So I quit smoking. And it wasn't the willpower method or the realization that my health is being fucked up. I just saw the illusion that smoking was giving me.

I want anyone who wants to quit to do this experiment. This experiment requires one cigarette but this cigarette will hopefully be the one to break the illusion that nicotine creates.

1. Pick up your cigarette and light it.

2. Put your cigarette to your mouth and inhale. And then slowly exhale and watch the smoke.

3. On your second puff, take another drag. This time, close your eyes and exhale. Keep your eyes closed for 10 seconds and then open your eyes. The smoke should have dissipated by then.

4. Now, keep your cigarette in your hand by your side and don't put it to your lips. Close your eyes, inhale deeply, and slowly exhale. Keep your eyes closed for 10 seconds and open it.

Now tell me, what felt different in all three exhales? 

Which exhale felt the best to you?

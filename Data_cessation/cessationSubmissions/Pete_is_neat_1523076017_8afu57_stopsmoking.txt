Day 3, NRT and sleep hypnosis

I've done this before and it seems to work for me. Last year I made it almost 11 months. Wednesday I started again here's my regime 

 I use the vapor mist mouth spray. The hypnosis is available on YouTube type "8 hour quit smoking ". 

Other tips.  Cardio, saunas, steam room and peanut butter m&amp;ms . Eat more than normal. Be more active.

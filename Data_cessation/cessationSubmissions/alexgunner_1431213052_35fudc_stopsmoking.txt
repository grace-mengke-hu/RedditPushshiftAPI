My stategy to quit smoking

Hi, I recently started to read this subreddit and I want to quit smoking. I smoke around 15 to 20 cigarretes every day and it's starting to affect me,I can't run as I used to and I also get tired really fast,even when I only walk for a while.
In order to quit I started to smoke 8 cigarretes every day, after a week i cut down to 6, the next week 4 and so on.
The problem is that I already failed and I tried to quit smoking any cigarrete and also failed. I just want todo know if someone did something similar to what I intend and would like to receive advice....

Quitting with e-cigs was the best decision ever [4 weeks no nicotine]

Just want to share my experience with e-cigs.  I know that they are not 100% healthy, but I found that 2 weeks on ecigs allowed me to start exercising without the cravings getting in the way, plus I could build up momentum for the inevitable weight gain that typically dampened my enthusiasm during previous quit attempts.  Also ecigs helped me at my most crutch-required times, like the bar, where gum and patches were often ineffective.  

I mean I totally support cold turkey, but I found that this method permitted me to quit without as much disruption to my life, and to avoid weight gain. I have actually lost about 20 lbs since I quit.

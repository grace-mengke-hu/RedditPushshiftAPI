Day one almost over.

Hello,
So I have just a little under 24 hours, about 19 hours. I’ve been smoking for the past 12 years. I’m about a pack a day smoker. Let me tell you, I quit drinking when I was 24 and haven’t had a drink in 9 years. I quit smoking weed that same year. I quit doing coke and heroin. However this right here, nicotine is brutal. The mental obsession, the physical craving. The irritability on focusing on tasks. It is tough. I do know it gets easier. I do know too that if I smoke just one cigarette I’m back to the races again.

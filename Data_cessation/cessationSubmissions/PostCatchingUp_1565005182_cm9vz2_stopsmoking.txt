How long until you stopped coughing up stuff?

I'm 22 and suffer from asthma (I know that smoking was the dumbest thing I could do). I smoked for about 4 years and had got bronchitis a couple of times, leading me to quit. It's been 4 months now and although better, Im still coughing stuff up sometimes and have a (much lighter) cough that still hasn't gone away. Just wanted to know how long you guys were still clearing your lungs and coughing after your quit. Thanks guys!

Day 4 as a non smoker

I've lurked Reddit and this sub for years but never posted. Well today I am finally ready for my first post. I'm on day 4 after 17 years of smoking. I started young and I'm 31 years old now. 

I read Allen Carr's easyway and felt a real difference in my perception of smoking. For the most part it really is easy but whenever I get that uncomfortable pang and my brain goes to the old rhetoric of "this is so hard" I challenge myself "Is it really?" War is hard. Famine is hard. Loss is hard. This is no loss, it is good and it's only as hard as I make it. I then actively think of all I'm gaining and the pang disappears.

A few additional things that are helping. I've also given up coca cola. Another addiction of mine. I'm drinking a lot of water instead. I add a couple of slices of lemon or cucumber to my water bottle for a little flavour.

Also I have made personal reminders in my quit smoking app that remind me of all I am gaining. I've started an at home teeth whitening process and am taking better care of my skin with a skincare routine morning and night.

I'm also recently out of a job and this is very stressful plus I have more time on my hands than is ideal but I'm focusing on job hunting, organising the house and doing all the little and big jobs I never had time to do when working. 

My house looks great, my teeth and skin are  improving, I'm super hydrated and actually have energy. I feel great and feel my confidence in myself returning! I've got this.

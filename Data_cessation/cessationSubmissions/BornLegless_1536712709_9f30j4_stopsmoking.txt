Easy exercise challenges to deal with cravings? / to help quit smoking

I have quit smoking 6-7 times now. Its usually after 3-4 weeks that I cave into the "just have one".

&amp;nbsp;

I've gone 4-5 days without smoking so far. I realised I need "something", and I think an exercise challenge would work really well. 

1. Change an unhealthy habit into a healthier one

2. Exercises that help with anger/frustration/stress etc etc

&amp;nbsp;

Does anyone know of any challenges that would help with cravings and tone my body?

&amp;nbsp;

No "run for 5 minutes" bs. Things I can do anywhere at any hour.

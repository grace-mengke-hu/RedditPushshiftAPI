Interesting thing I noticed.

Hi, my name is PandemicCatShit (really) and I'm at 2 weeks now. Which is neat. Anyway. 

The two weeks I've been here, I noticed every Sunday/Monday, there is an increased amount of of people who have been set back in their attempt to remain smoke-free. 

I just want to remind you all...

THINK about it next weekend. You're going to go out, and you're going to put yourself in a vulnerable place, surround yourself with people who smoke and bring your inhibitions down with alcohol. If you're really struggling that much - avoid it. 

This is your life. This is your health. This is your future. This is your wallet. This is your family. Smoking is not a game. It seriously hurts your body and the people around you. *It takes time away from you*. 

If you smoke one night? Fine. But you better wake up and realize you can't do that shit anymore. Don't go out and buy a pack because you smoked while drunk. Don't throw in the towel because you think it's inevitable. It's most definitely not. For as long as people have been smoking, people have been quitting - **successfully** - and they are no different from you or I. 

Man up. Take responsibility. Quit.

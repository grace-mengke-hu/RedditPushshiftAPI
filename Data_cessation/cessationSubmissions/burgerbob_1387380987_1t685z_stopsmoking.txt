30 Days have come and gone, success!!

Thanks stopsmoking!  I just wanted to celebrate a moment.  It's been 34 days now and I've done it!!!  I took Chantix for the first two weeks and it changed my mental state, in a horrible way, but it killed my cravings.  (basically, I was an asshole while on it -- but it helped...sigh)  I've been Chantix free for over 3 weeks and I'm finally coming around, back to my normal self and being smoke free is freak'n awesome!!  
Good luck to all trying to get it done.

Day 1 of first real attempt

Hello everyone,
I am 27 years old and I have not gone one day without smoking since I was 18 or so when I got my wisdom teeth pulled. I took my first drag at 15 and never looked back and was at a pack a day by 17. Two days ago when the Giants won the World Series I had some sort of epiphany and started to feel really disgusted with myself for smoking and realized how physically Ill I feel. I bought patches yesterday and have not had a smoke in 22 hours. I know it's not much to you all but this is farther than I dreamed of going already and I hope I can continue down this path. I am tired of spending my money to die so Philip Morris can get more of my loot. Wish me luck because I know I will need it.

Edit: passed the 25 hour mark. Working 15 hour days does not make this any easier ;-;

365 days!

It’s been one whole year. I quit last year on Christmas and I am so grateful to be where I am now. 

Thanks for all of your support. But holidays are tough but I made it! And it was a dry Christmas, too! Anything is possible, man. 

I’m wishing everyone health and happiness in the new year. Here’s to another year smoke free!

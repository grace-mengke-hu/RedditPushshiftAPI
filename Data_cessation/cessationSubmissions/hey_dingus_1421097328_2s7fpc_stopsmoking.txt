Started a new job marketing cigarettes. Everyone there smokes.

I'm almost six months and haven't had a craving in a long time until today. Even when I have dreams about smoking, my subconscious knows I'm not a smoker. This new job, however, is with a marketing team that promotes cigarettes (fine print: only to adults 21+ who have made a decision to use tobacco products. We're not out to convert non-smokers into smokers). I got the job because it pays well and I need the money.  
  
So today I came in, filled out paper work, a little bit of training, the usual day one stuff. Out of the five people that were in the office today, I was the only non smoker, but I went out with them to be social when they took smoke breaks. I'm worried because I actually had a craving to smoke, something that I haven't had in a long time. I know that I'm not a smoker anymore, but I guess after doing it for ten years, these cravings can come back.  
  
  
I refuse to relapse and inhale another cigarette. Hopefully being around it all the time, and not giving in, will strengthen my resolve... I'm too close to six months to relapse now! I guess I just wanted to get this off my chest. Stay strong everyone.

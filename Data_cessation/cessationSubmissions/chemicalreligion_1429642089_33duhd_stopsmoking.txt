Withdrawals (First day)

I was vaping to ween myself off nicotine but I woke up today and my throat was sore from the vape so I haven't touched it but I've spent most of the day in bed feeling somewhat sick, sorta like a cold. My mind is racing and have mental energy but my body is tired and I keep eating snacks but I'm not getting full. How long does this shitty feeling last?

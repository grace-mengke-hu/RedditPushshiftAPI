Accidentally stopped smoking for the last day while sick.

This is less of a request for support and more of me just thinking out loud.

I spent the last two nights sick and mostly in bed, and I haven't had a cigarette in about 27 hours. Yesterday morning, "quitting smoking" wasn't even remotely on my list of things to do in the very near future, but now I'm toying with the idea of just rolling with it.

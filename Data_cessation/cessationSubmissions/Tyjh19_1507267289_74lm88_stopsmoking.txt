Longest I've gone without smoking in 8 years. I've quit many times, but this time feels real. Downloaded an app and use it as motivation. Used patch for a week, now nothing. I've never been so motivated. I was told once "a craving lasts 20 seconds. When you first quit, you have your 20 second craving every 60 seconds. Then every 80. Then 120. You just have to beat those 20 seconds. Your brain distracts itself after 20 seconds. So beat it"

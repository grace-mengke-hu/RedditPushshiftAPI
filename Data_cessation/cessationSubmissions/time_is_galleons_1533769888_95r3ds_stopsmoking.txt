Almost 2 weeks in- instant benefits!

I had my last cigarette Friday 2 weeks ago. Even while smoking, ive maintained an active lifestyle, running a few times a week. 

Well since stopping, I’ve been able to run further than previously, and run faster- in fact I’ve shaved 30s off my per km time in just a week! These benefits are so immediate, they give me a huge amount of motivation to stick with my decision not to smoke. Im already noticing my skin and body looking better, and my fitness has increased already just as a result of improved lung capacity. 

Great decision!

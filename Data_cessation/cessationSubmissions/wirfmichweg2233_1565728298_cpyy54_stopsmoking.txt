Weird heart rate and anxiety

Hey Guys,
Made this account so I can turn my life around a bit, while updating to see how much progress I make and to keep me disciplined. 
So im on day 5/6, stopped because I was sent jome from work because I looked pale and felt like I was going to throw up, and tought why not just stop now? I still have this weird heart rate and Im really anxious about it, and I cant really sit still. I noticed how out of shape I am when I tried excercising today and had to stop after my first set because i was so out of breath. Really scared that work tomorrow will make me break. Just needed to get this out I guess.

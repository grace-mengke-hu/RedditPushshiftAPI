Day 3

I am proud of myself for completing the first 2 days! 😊
However I feel I have shut myself off from the world to do it!
I haven't left the house for fear of falling back into the habit of having a smoke when doing specific things. examples...

Waiting for a bus and or taxi train.
Walking down the street (confidence).
In pub when drinking.
Out for a meal between courses.
At specific times of the day in work 10am 1pm 3pm 5pm!
When stressed in work.
When board / to pass time.
Getting off public transport.

There are probally many more... I have however been successful reisting the cravings for the specific time in the house when alone and with my partner examples...
with cup of tea.
morning smoke
after dinner smoke
inbetween programme smoke
night night smoke
and the big one.... After an argumemt smoke!! 😊

I am proud I have resisted during these times especially when my partner is also a smoker and is still smoking. I will used my strength of not smoking during these times to help me get through the next few days being out the house.

I can also feel some of the health benefit 2days in. I always had a consistant tight chest and one of my reasons for stoping is better health I can feel that it is easier to breath already without wheezing 😁

my mantra will be 
I AM STRONG! NOT EVEN ONE DRAG!' 😁

4 full days without smoking and this is the hardest thing I've ever done.

I stopped because of my little sister. She cried because she kept thinking I was going to get "the cancer" so I made a pledge to stop.

Now I feel depressed. I feel like a cigarette is the one light in my life that can bring me happiness. 

This feels so horrible. I never really thought I'd say this but I'm also having suicidal thoughts. What should I do?

I need a smoke and I can't think of anything else.

I found a Cigarette Lighter While Cleaning the House...

Today I was mopping the living room, and I moved the couch. I found a white Bic cigarette lighter lying among the dust bunnies and other nastiness. It must have slipped out of my pocket weeks ago. 

As you can tell from my badge, as of the time I'm posting this, it's been 36 days since I've had a puff. I had the strangest feeling when I saw the lighter. I had the strangest feeling when I saw it. It was like peering into someone else's life. I had no desire to smoke, but the trigger item invoked memories of my several failed attempts to quit over the past year or so. 

I immedieately threw the lighter away. It was easy, and I'm proud of myself. I post this for those of us who have just quit.... It gets easier.... much easier, the more time that passes. We can take back control of our lives.

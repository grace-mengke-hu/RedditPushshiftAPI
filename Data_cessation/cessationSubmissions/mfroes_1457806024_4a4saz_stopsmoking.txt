I want to quit smoking, how should I go about doing so?

I'm 18 years old and living in Amsterdam for my University studies. I've been smoking for 3 years. I realized that ever since coming to university I've been smoking up to a pack a day. I'm out of shape and lazier than ever. I know that if I quit smoking it'll be easier to improve my lifestyle. I've tried going cold turkey and I've tried to cut down little by little. Whichever way I tried, I always went back to smoking. All my friends smoke so it's hard to "stay away" from tobacco. How should I go about doing so? 

tldr young adult living in the city of weed and tobacco who wants to improve lifestyle by quitting, help

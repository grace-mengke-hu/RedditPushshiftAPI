Last cigarette a couple hours ago!

This isn't the first time I've tried to quit but I really want to stay committed this go around. I'm getting back into therapy for depression and getting back on anti depressants.  I want to become healthier and happier and this is the first step.

Edit- I've sent a message to the mod bot to have my badge reset

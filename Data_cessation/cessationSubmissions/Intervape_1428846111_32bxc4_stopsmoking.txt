I didn't pick up a pack today

This morning I was feeling productive, for the first time ever I woke up and didn't want a cigarette. I left all my money at home today and will probably keep it like that all week. 

I've been at work for 3 hours now and would've already taken several smoke breaks. I feel...good. Healthy. I can do this. Lets kick this before I kick myself. 

Just had to tell someone but does anyone have any tips for keeping your mind occupied in a quiet office? I think I'll take a 5 minute non-smoke break because it's beautiful outside!

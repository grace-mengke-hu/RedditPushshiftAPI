Physical cravings and psychological addiction - 3 weeks into NRT

Hi all,

I'm looking for some advice. I stopped smoking cigarettes around 3 weeks ago. I am on 4mg nicotine gum. I feel the cravings are not going away. In fact, I feel the cravings are getting stronger and I use more gums to fix this feeling.

I have also fired up my vape after a couple of months off it and I noticed I use it more and more. I think the vape is my response to psychological addiction, as I am missing this "bubble around me" feeling that smoking was providing me with.

My questions are:

1. Do you think it's time to go for lower strength gums 2mg, as another step towards freedom?

2. Do you think I should quit vape, as it is simply less harmful prosthetic of smoking, but doesn't actually deal with the psychological addiction?

I appreciate your response.
Thanks.

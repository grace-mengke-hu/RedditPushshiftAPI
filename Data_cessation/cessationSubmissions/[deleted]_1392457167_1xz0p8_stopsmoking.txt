This was never supposed to be me

I'm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, but I felt I should share. 

I've never had an addictive personality. Even now I know I don't struggle as much as others. At least with smoking that is. I will say that I'm addicted to food, and that is my hardest struggle. As a young married mother with 2 young boys that is the only this I sincerely struggle with when it comes to self control. But that's besides the point because that's not why I'm here. 

My mother was a smoker for as long as I remember. It was kind of comforting in a way...the smell, her daily routine of going off to the porch to have a smoke (or 2 or 3) and I would go outside with her, and we would talk. I love my mother, she's the strongest person I know. Her habit of a smoker never bothered me (except for the one time I remember hiding my moms cigarettes)

Ive been smoking now for a few months after I had sworn it off. I had post partum depression with my youngest, and I started to self harm, and began smoking again. Don't worry, I'm in therapy now and I no longer self harm, but I'm having troubles kicking the habit. I hide it from my husband- bad bad **bad**. I have a few left in my pack, then I'm done. 

It's that I worry about the food. If I don't smoke I binge eat. Sometimes I binge eat anyway, but it's cut it down considerably. Both are extremely bad habits. I have enough self control to stop smoking. It's just so nice to escape outside for 10 minutes for that disgusting lousy cancer stick. To escape from my hectic life as a mom, to forget the chores I have to do or appointments I have to remember. 

I guess I'm here because as much as I enjoy that little escape, it's not worth the health risks. For me, my kids or my marriage, not to mention my wallet. 

The only thing I love more than my cigarettes and food is reddit. I'm just looking for support I guess. I'm glad your all here.

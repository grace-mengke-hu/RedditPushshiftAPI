Gutted and disappointed in myself - failed on day 36

I’ve been a smoker for 24 years. I’m almost 41 years old and have struggled with anxiety for as long as I can remember. The panic attacks can be horrendous but I’ve been managing successfully without medication mostly. This is my 7th attempt to stop smoking but first going cold turkey (with the smoke free app). Day 36 and was doing great until tonight ... getting ready to move to our new house this weekend and all got a bit too much. Tried to create private space to breathe through the panic attack but family wouldn’t allow me that so went outside and smoked an old cigarette butt. Hate myself now and feel so angry!

Yes every quit is different, but it would help a lot if someone else who's been quit longer had something similar to share.

I started my quit on 6/24 with the patch.
I ripped off the patch and went cold turkey so to speak 8/10.
So my quit of smoking is 132 days and my quit of nicotine is 85 days.  Either way, I expected the physical symptoms to be over by now, based on everything I read.  But I can't sleep over an hour and a half at a time, I can't focus or concentrate at work like I used to, and I'm hateful.

I figure the lack of sleep might be causing the rest.  But I would feel a lot better if I knew that someone else still had these symptoms at about the same time and it eventually cleared up.  I have NO desire to smoke.  NONE.  But I sure am ready for this crap to be over and I could use some encouragement.

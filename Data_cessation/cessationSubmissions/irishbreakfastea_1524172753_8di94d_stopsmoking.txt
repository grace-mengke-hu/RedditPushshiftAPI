Relapsed

I almost went 11 days.  I had 3 cigarettes last night, and bought a pack today.  There have been some extremely stressful situations in my life lately that led me to convince myself smoking is the answer.  I am very upset with myself, but I have never been this stressed in my life before.  I feel like I am going to have a nervous breakdown, and now I am smoking again.  I just need the support.  I want to quit again

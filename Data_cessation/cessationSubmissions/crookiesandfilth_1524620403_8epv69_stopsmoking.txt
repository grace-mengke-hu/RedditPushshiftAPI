Want to quit smoking but have emetophobia. Anyone experienced extreme vomiting while quitting?

So I quit smoking a little over a year ago, it lasted 30 days. The first 3 days after quitting (I was still vaping) I got violently ill. Vomiting every 5 minutes. I have emetophobia (fear of vomiting) and this sent my already diagnosed anxiety and phobia into a cyclone. I havenâ€™t been able to quit since because of my extreme fear. Anyone else ever experienced this? And what can I do to be able to quit and also not get sick?

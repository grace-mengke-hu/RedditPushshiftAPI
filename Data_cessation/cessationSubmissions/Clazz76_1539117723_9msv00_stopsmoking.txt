Day 9

So I am soon going to be entering the 10th day of being a non smoker after 24 years! I am not going to lie! It's hard going and as a plus size girl already I am finding myself picking at bad thinkings I shouldn't have. I have also had 3 days of constant seizures (I have refractory epilepsy). I don't know whether the stress of quiting is what is causing the extra seizures ........ but I am going to fight through!! Good luck everyone on your journey!!!

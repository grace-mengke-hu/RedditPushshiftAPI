Can passive smoking get nicotine into your system?

My girlfriend smokes a lot so I'm worried this is going to be an issue, more than the constant presence of cigs. 


It's actually day 2 for me without smoking and I'm feeling so excited and happy about my decision. It's like I'm already a non-smoker, today I went to my garden and just breath in the flowers and grass. I can't wait to get back my lungs and health shape, so I can join a gym, start running, and be happy again.

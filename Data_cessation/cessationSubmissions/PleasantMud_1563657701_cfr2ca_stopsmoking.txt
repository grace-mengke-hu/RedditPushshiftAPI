8 weeks to a half marathon and day 1 without cigarettes

Hi everyone. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today marked 8 weeks until my first half marathon. I've decided that I am going to stop smoking for the next 8 weeks. I've made a deal with myself that if I don't see any marked improvements in my life after the 8 weeks are up, I can go back to smoking. I also know how quickly time goes and that the 8 weeks will be gone before I know it. I think the busy workout schedule should also help distract me from the inner voice begging for nicotine.

Day 1 went overall very well. I did have a few panicky moments where I thought to myself that there was no way in hell I would resist buying a pack today but I did. One thing that helped me today was that every time the thought came into my head that I wanted a cigarette, I said out loud, 'TRIGGER' and then tried to figure out what thought pattern had caused the craving to come about. For example, I went for a walk and started coughing towards the end, instantly wanted a cigarette. I figured out that the trigger was anxiety about the cough and all the damage smoking has caused me already. Haha, the insanity of wanting to take that anxiety away by having another cigarette. The mind is a fragile thing.

I also went home today and spent time with my dad, which I probably wouldn't have done if I was still smoking today, as I never smoke around them and it really does keep me from visiting them. I also don't really associate my home house with smoking so it was a good place to retreat to today.

I am worried about the next few days, I know I will have a real battle on my hands. I'm going to yoga in the morning and then I will go for a short run, but I find Sundays and Mondays really tough without cigarettes. And Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, who I am kidding? But I have cleaning to do tomorrow in the house, and I normally use cigarette breaks between jobs to get me through that. So I know that will prove a challenge. Also, I'm pretty good at day 1s, it's normally late day 2/early day 3 the panic really begins to set in.

Anyway, my plan is to check in here every day until the half marathon, I really hope things in my life do get better in the next 8 weeks and I will be happy to be rid of cigarettes forever more.

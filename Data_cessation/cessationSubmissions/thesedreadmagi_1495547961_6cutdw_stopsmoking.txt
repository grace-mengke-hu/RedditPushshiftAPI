Day 8 here, seeking a bit of support and reassurance

Hey y'all,

I'm on day 8 so I suppose I'm past the worst of the physical withdrawal and I haven't caved or cheated at all (despite a lot of temptation) and don't plan to, but I'm still trying to cope with not being able to smoke when I normally would have, I still really want cigarettes, and I'm still irritable and quick to anger at people I don't want to be angry at. I also feel like my brain is still struggling simply to process and think the way it did pre-quitting, like I'm slow, hazy, and dull-witted in a way that I so do not want to be.

Tell me this ends, please, that it gets better, that it's worth it, that there are reasons to keep going with this. Because at the moment, I'm asking myself why the hell I'm doing this in the first place.

Thank you kindly. This is a great support group. The internet isn't all garbage and assholes.

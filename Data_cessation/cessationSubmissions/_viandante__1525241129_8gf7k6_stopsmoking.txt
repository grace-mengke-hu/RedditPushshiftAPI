4 days smoke-free!!

Hi to all, I'm from Italy and this site has been suggested to me from an App and I've decided to write a post.
I'm living my 4th smoke-free day.
I've read the Allen Carr's book and stopped smoking during an "holiday" (I like spending my holidays walking, in this case I've walked 200 km and after 150 km I've smoked my last cigarette). Today I come back to work, I hope that enough days are passed by and I will be able to breaking all my habits (cigarette after coffee, cigarette before a meeting, cigarette when I feel stressed ...).
I feel strong today! More days are passing and better I'm feeling. I'm having less thoughts about smoking, I know I have to stay concentrated!

I hope my English is understandable :D

Thank you to all :)

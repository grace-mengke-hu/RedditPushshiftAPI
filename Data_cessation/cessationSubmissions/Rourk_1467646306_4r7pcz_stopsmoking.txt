How I quit smoking, again.

Hello all.  First time poster here, but it worked very well for me, so I thought I'd share.

I've quit smoking several times in the past, once was due to being hospitalized, started back up a month later.  My longest time, I used the patch.  That lasted for 2 years or so, but I went back to it.  I've tried using the patch since then, and it would work, but I'd lose interest in it.

I started getting smokers cough, laugh, fatigue, everything a few months back, so I knew I wanted to quit and was ready, but was skeptical about those OTC methods.

This time, I switched to vaping.  Now, I'm not here to advocate it, sell any specific brand or what not, I'll just share my method.

With vaping, you can control the amounts of nicotine.  So one pack of cigarettes is roughly 21mg of nicotine.  So, I started out with a 20mg vape "juice".  

Within a day or two the switch was complete and I enjoyed it more then smoking.  No stink, no need to go outside, and I FELT healthier. 

That lasted about a month or two until I knocked the nicotine down to 18.  Then to 15, 12, etc etc etc.

When I got down to 3mg of nicotine, I started worrying.  Because the next step is 1.5 or 0.  However, at the vape shops, theyre able to add nicotine in to whatever I wanted.  So I went from 3, to 2, to 1.5, to 1, to 0.

Now I'm nicotine free, cigarette free, and vape free.

TL:DR I used vaping to quit smoking.

If anyone has questions, I'll be more than happy to answer =)

GOOD LUCK!

First post-5 days strong!

New to this whole thing. I smoked a pack a day for 10 years and 5 days ago I decided to stop. I quit cold turkey with only gum and sunflower seeds to help with my cravings. I'm taking things 1 day at a time, but for the first time in awhile I can see a light at the end of the tunnel.
Thank you all who read this...I'm just trying to put my self out there.

Question About Quit Date

Hey guys, I realize this is a trivial question, but, how do you handle your quit date? For example, if you smoke your last cigarette on January 1st, is _that_ your "I quit on..." date, or would it be January 2nd---your first day as a non smoker? When figuring out how many days, weeks, months you've gone, which date is that from? Make sense?

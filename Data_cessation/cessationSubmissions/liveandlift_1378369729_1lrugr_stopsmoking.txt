Fitness to help in smoking cessation? Tips from active people who quit smoking?

Hi there,

I am a smoker looking to quit. As exhausting and jarring as the quitting process is (have done so a few times) continuing to smoke is an even more exhausting prospect. I haven't always been as active as I could be in my life but generally have decent fitness habits - I walk almost everywhere, take my dogs out, hike, bike, and I have been on a weight training program for a while now.

I am in love with weights and this, more than anything else, has made me reassess smoking and reignited my desire to quit. I have goals that I want to meet and in some form or other fitness is something I want to do for the rest of my life, NOT SMOKING. 

My plea to the fitness guys and gals is to load me up with your tips and strategies for getting through the first couple of months, what milestones and progress you noticed that kept you going, anything! 

I've thought of a few things to cope with cravings, like jump rope, do wall squats or burpees until I'm back in reality. Any other tips would be more than appreciated and your successes just add to my motivation.

Thank you!

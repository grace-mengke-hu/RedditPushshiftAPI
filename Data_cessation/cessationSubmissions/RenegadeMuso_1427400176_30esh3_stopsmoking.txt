Craving right now...who do I turn to? You guys.

I had a massive meal...probably the trigger. But, it's also kinda hot, and I am restless which is the real trigger. 

It's amazing how strong one can be 2 months after quitting. Even though I am craving, it is not strong enough to compel me to go and buy smokes. I will rather brave through it with the knowledge that it will pass and I will be fine. 

one another note...maybe I'll go buy an icecream :) Nom Nom Nom. 

Happy Smokefree life. 

Cheers, 
Renegade.

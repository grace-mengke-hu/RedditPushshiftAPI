Urge to "enjoy pleasure" (Vaping nic to me = Coffee lovers = wine enthousiasts) Oh lord...

I always land in this spot. I'm down to quit... I get to 2 months, 4, 5 ,6 or 7.

Eventually I totally forget about the BALANCE between why quitting is more important than enjoying myself.


Right now I'm suddenly remembering vaping a nice peach flavoured 3mg nicotine and enjoying it in front of my PC while I work on my programming tasks.... ARG....   What do you do when you remember your addiction as being pleasurable. 


Any inputs appreciated.

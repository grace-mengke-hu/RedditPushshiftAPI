Starting today !

I’ve been trying for a few weeks now to quit smoking , nothings worked yet but I believe I’m finally in the right mental space to actually begin this process,bought some Nicolette fruit chew flavor , and day one I have been  smoke free all day long . 
I see a few more cigarettes down the road towards quitting, but I’m hopeful ,
 just found this sub , 👊🏾 power to y’all trying to quit !

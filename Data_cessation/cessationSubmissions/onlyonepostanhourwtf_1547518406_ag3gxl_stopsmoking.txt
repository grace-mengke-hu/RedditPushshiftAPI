End of day 1. I actually did it. Feeling proud.

My eyes feel puffy. I feel restless and energetic. Instead of lighting a cigarette when I felt a good/bad emotion, I had to acknowledge the feeling and deal with it some other way. I feel a craving for SOMETHING. I ate a bit much today.

I haven't gone a day without smoking in months.

Negatives: Feel antsy and like one cigarette will bring me back to level.

Positives: Feel cleaner and more energetic. Lips arent dry. Breath doesnt smell of smoke too much. I'm feeling things more intensely.

Day 1 complete though.

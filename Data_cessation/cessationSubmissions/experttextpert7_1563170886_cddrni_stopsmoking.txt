Broke and smoked just now after 2 days quit. Could use some help

I had made it 2 days without a smoke, ran a 10k yesterday and didn't have any cravings. But as soon as it got to this morning, on my way to work I just broke and bought a pack. 

Weekends are not a problem for me but the idea of not having on during a work day panics me. I can't imagine not having that morning smoke before work. Everyone at work smokes and I have quite a few points in my day where I could smoke. 

I just can't stay quit when it comes to work, I've tried Alan Carrs book. I just don't know what I can do, I always lose the mental battle and end up justifying it in my head. Feel really low right now cause my girlfriend was really proud of me 

How can I get over those work smokes and particularly that morning smoke??

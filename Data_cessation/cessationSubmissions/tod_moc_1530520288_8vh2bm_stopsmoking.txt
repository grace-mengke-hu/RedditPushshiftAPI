I just woke up with the intense idea that I need to quit right now! But I got a problem..

Hi guys, I just wanted to share that I just woke up with the feeling that I need to quit right know.  I'm a smoker since I'm 16 (26 today),  I'm going to be dad, and I feel it's the good moment to quit.  But I got a serious problem, I really love smoking joint, how can I manage this thing? 

Thanks you all for your strength and your inspirationnal messages.

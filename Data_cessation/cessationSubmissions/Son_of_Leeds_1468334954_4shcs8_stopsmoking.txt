48 Hours In... My body feels wonderful, but how the heck do I stop these mood swings?!?

Hey guys, I stopped smoking 48 hours (2 days) ago, and so far it's ALMOST amazing. I've been chewing non-nicotine gum when I get cravings, and using this app called Smoke Free to see how much money and minutes of life I've saved ($18.67 and almost 11 hours of life!). I feel like I can already breathe better, and I have so much more energy than I used to. There's only one problem... The irritability. 

I'm usually a super calm, laid-back person, but after not smoking for 48 hours, it feels like the littlest things can set me off and make me upset/angry. Any advice for handling the irritability? Thanks guys!

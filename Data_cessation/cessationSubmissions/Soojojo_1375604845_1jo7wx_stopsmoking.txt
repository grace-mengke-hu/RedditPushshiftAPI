Wrinkles

I went to a 60th birthday party. Some of the women looked 15 years older and some about my age 55. Guess who the smokers were! I started to psyc myself up to stop that month. I don't smoke very much, maybe 7 a day and all in the evening. One party goer said that the evening was the worst time to smoke because you don't give your lungs time to recover. I have stopped and started many times in my life but helping myself to look older! Mad! I already have too many wrinkles but haven't got to the deep cardboard look yet.

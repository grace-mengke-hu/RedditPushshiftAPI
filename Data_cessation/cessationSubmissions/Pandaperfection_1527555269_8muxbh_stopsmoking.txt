6 months today!

Today makes six months free from smoking. There were some hard, hard days, but it gets so much better!

Beware of boredom and fight for freedom every day. You are worth this. 

Things that worked for me:
Walking a lot
Not drinking at all
Not drinking soda (I quit that first)
Cleaning, reading and watching tv if I started to get even a little bored
Going to bed at 7 or 6 or right after work if it was a hard day
Carpooling with someone who doesn’t smoke
Taking lots of hot baths
Doing my nails
Thinking about people I don’t like who smoke and thinking about how weak they are
Focusing on how I was saving my skin, lungs, heart
Wearing and buying nice perfume
The smoke free app (green and free, although I paid for premium)
Posting here
Using patches for the first 6 weeks
Reminding myself every day I was not going to smoke for any reason
Remembering my worst day of crying and screaming and insane behavior and knowing that was behind me and I never wanted to have to quit and go through that again
Cooking
Celebrating every milestone on the app
Smelling smokers and feeling superior

Whatever works for you will work, just keep at it. If I can do this, you can too.

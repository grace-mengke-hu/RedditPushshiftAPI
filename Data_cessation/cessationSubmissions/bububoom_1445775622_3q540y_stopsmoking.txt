Question to those who quit for > 6months

Hello. I read a lot of posts here saying "spending money on anything except smoking is better", "your lungs will thank you" and similar responses.

I actually feel different as I liked smoking and still like it I just know it hurts my body and being my prime age(25) I want to be as best physically fit as possible so I gave up on smoking.

But it still seems like a pleasurable experience. I dont judge people who smoke. Some of my friends smoke and I kinda feel better than them and then immediately I feel jealousy because cigarettes were a pleasure for me, not even as a ritual but I like the taste and smell of it.

Just wanted to share thoughts and get some insight from other people.

EDIT: thanks for support :)

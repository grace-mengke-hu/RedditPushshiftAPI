It's time to quit. Again. But first, an exercise question.

Hello. I'm 19 years old. I've been smoking since this time last year. I currently smoke half a pack a day. This is day one of my choice to quit smoking weed, I'm already on r/leaves. Day one of quitting cigarettes comes when I finish this next pack. I've downloaded the stopsmoking app and thrown out my ash trays. I've warned all my smoking buddies in our dorm that I won't come out anymore. I'm feeling ready and like this will really be my last pack.

I want to pair quitting with a workout routine as I am currently pretty sedentary. I've been using the resources I can find on reddit and elsewhere to start envisioning what that workout might look like but I'm coming to this sub to see what the smokers experience might be. 

For those of you exercised as part of your quit smoking plan:
What did you do?
How were the first few days?
How did you know you were improving and how soon?
What are your most important tips and pieces of advice?

Thank you, I do really appreciate it, and I'll be sure to post again on this sub on day one.

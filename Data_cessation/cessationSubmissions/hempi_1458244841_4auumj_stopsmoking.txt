Active cannabis user trying to quit cigarettes for good.

Hi guys, this is my first post on Reddit. I am 25 years old and have been smoking about 20-25 cigarettes a day for last 9 years. I am also a very heavy cannabis user. 
A few months back I got some major dental issues and blamed cigarettes for it. I have otherwise been healthy. 

I decided to quit cold turkey and as of today I have been smoke free for last five days ( 125 hours to be precise). I had some intense withdrawal symptoms but those seem to be getting less intense. I was all happy about it until an hour back when I smoked half a cigarette. Nothing made me do it. I kind of just did it. Do you guys think I will get withdrawal symptoms again? Others who have quit successfully, is it alright to slip? Any help, support, motivation would be awesome. 

P.s. - I smoke about 5-8 joints a day but currently am on a tolerance break. Do you think when I start weed again I will get urge to smoke cigarettes? 

Thank you! :)

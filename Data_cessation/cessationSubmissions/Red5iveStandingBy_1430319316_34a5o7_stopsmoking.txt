Quit 1 Year Ago Today!

Hi everyone. I haven't been very active on this subreddit for many months, but back when I first quit (April 29, 2014) I was here often. Reading and posting. Getting encouragement from everyone here and trying to help others.

So it has been one year since I quit!*

Not one cigarette in that whole time. Not one puff. Through some stressful stuff and some happy stuff... still no smoking. I'm pretty happy about that.

I just want to thank everyone here who helped me. Everyone keep up the great work. If I can do it, you can too!

EDIT: I had smoked for about 15 years. I quit cold turkey. No vaping, no patches, no nicotine replacement. I just wanted to stop.

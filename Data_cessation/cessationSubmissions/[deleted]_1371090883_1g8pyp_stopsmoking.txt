Got my Star!

After 15 years of doing something that has zero positive effect on my life, I felt it was time for change. I didn't sign up for a badge until I went all day without a cig yesterday. I have lurked and read everyone's posts about struggles and tips how to get through. Thank you all for the much needed encouragement.

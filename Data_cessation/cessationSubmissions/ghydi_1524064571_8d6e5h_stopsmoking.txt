Quit for 42 days on my 42nd Birthday

Technically I turned 42 yesterday and today is 43 days without a cigarette.  Forgot to post this yesterday.  For a little background, I started smoking when I was 21. Can't remember exactly, but probably late September to late October of 1995 is when I started. Quit for 4-7 days in January 2005 right before my daughter was born, until my truck got stolen a couple of days before her due date. And I quit for a another 4-7 days in 2013 while deployed.

I started working my way closer to quitting last summer and read Alan Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking. Started thinking about some of the things he said in the book over the last several months. Found this subreddit in February and was going to read the book again but then realized my birthday was coming up and set up a personal challenge. I called it 42 days at 42 years. So I smoked my last cigarette on March 5th at about 11:25pm, right before going to bed. I turned 42 on April 17th, so I hit 42 days without a smoke late at night on the 16th, also hit 1000 hours smoke free on the afternoon of the 16th.

I feel much better, I can breathe now!! I could really feel it the last couple of years when I couldn't catch my breath after running or hard physical exertion.

So, just wanted to say thanks to others in this subreddit, reading their experiences helped me. For anybody trying to quit, I would suggest setting a goal/challenge for yourself to make it mean something, maybe no smoking 30 days before summer or 100 days before the school year starts (kids school or yours).

My dad gave me advice

I’ve been thinking about this all night , My dad told me that It is possible to make this a positive experience if you transition your mind into thinking that one day   I won’t HAVE to smoke from one day I won’t WANT to smoke . 

Realize this addiction for what it is , a prison sentence . Now look at you , you walked out on that prison sentence and NO one is forcing you to suffer anymore . If you’ve made the decision to quit then you are already so close  

You CAN do this ! You WILL do this  transition your mind because you are not a smoker anymore and even the smokers are rooting for you , they all envy you they all want to be a non smoker like you are now too !  

I guess the thing to really take away from what my dad said to me was that you need to stop focusing on what you enjoyed about smoking and say out loud to yourself when you need encouragement how awful it is . Why do you hate it ! Why do you Need to change . How disgusting smoking is . Don’t let your guard down stay vigilant 

Also congrats on another day friends

Unpopular opinion/method

I was a pack a day, 15 year long smoker, until 6 months ago. Now I smoke when I go out with friends at weekends. Sunday comes and I'm done until friday. So basically I smoke on fridays and saturdays (when I go out). I thought this was something impossible to do and to be honest the first two months were not easy, but ~~I'm quite happy~~ I feel better and I don't feel I'm a smoker, although I kinda am.

Introducing Freedom Pods, nicotine replacement therapy. AMA

We are a startup that wants to help people curb their nicotine addictions. Our program starts you out at 5% (59mg/ml) and weans you down to a 0%, non-nicotine over the course of 6 months. During the 6 month program, we'll ship you all the vapes you need and you are to toss your nicotine based vapes.

[Freedom Pods](https://freedompods.co/) will come in mango and mint flavors packaged sleek disposable vapes.

Every user will have their own wean-down plan custom tailored to how many JUUL pods they're currently vaping through an algorithm verified by our Chief Medical Officer. He has been treating lung cancer patients from smoking cigarettes for years and has now been actively trying to help smokers get onto vaping regimes that help them wean-off smoking and nicotine completely.

We have opened our website up to secure pre-orders that will start with the 1st month of vapes. The 1st program will go live from September '19 - February '20 for about 100 users.

The motivation for this startup was our personal addictions to JUUL and seeing other young people suffering from nicotine addiction. Everytime we tried to quit cold turkey, we failed. We then started making our own custom pods with lower nic strengths while banning together to quit. We're simply packaging weaning down it for the people that feel it's inconvenient to fill on on their own. Check out our subreddit on r/freedompods

Day 1

So, as the title days this is day 1. My wife and I are quitting together. I'm about to head into work, and all my co-workers smoke and know that I smoke so it's going to be slightly challenging to not break down and ask them for one. 

I think I can do it this time though. I have confidence in myself.

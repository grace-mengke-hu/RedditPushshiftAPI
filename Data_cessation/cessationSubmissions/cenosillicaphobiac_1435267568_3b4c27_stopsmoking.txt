27 hrs in

Good news.  The constant crave (that started at around hour 4) seems to have subsided.   I still have a craving more than I don't have a craving, but I know that each craving will be weaker in all 3 ways.  Duration, frequency and strength.  I'm not going to lose this momentum, the very worst is over.  I can't wait for bedtime.

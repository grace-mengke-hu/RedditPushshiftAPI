First time having drinks w/ friends since & I didn't smoke

Recently started stopping and had a friend over last night and we had a few drinks and she would periodically go out and smoke. I would go out on the porch with her and keep conversation going and just bring a solo cup of water out with me and drink that while she smoked. worked well, i didn't smoke, and i stayed hydrated so that's a pretty decent combo.

Also i am a fan of Tim & Eric and they have this skit cigarette juice which is gross (gif link: http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view7/2991901/spagett-cigarette-juice-o.gif) and i have been using that to deter me from smoking as well.

I figure i would not want to drink water like that, why would i want to breathe air like that?

Weight gain and boredom!

Today is day 15, yay!
Weight gain is becoming an issue partly because Iâ€™m bored and also because everything tastes soo good! 
I really need to join a gym, I keep telling myself home work outs are cheaper and doable, but my kitchen is too close! 
Any tips are very welcome, thank you!

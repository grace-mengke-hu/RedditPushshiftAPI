Alright here we go again.

I should be 371 days smoke free. I picked up the habit again in September. As much as I enjoy cigs, the truth is they are stinky and ugly. My mom always told me, nothing turns a 10 into a 3 faster than a cigarette. 

I know it's going to be hard, but whatever, I'm done. Fuck you, Camels.

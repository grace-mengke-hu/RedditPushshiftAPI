64 days in, and ready to pick it up again.

Hi guys. Not much to say. I quit awhile ago, went through the patches, and started using a vaporizer. I started a new job today, and I have school coming up. I also had to start taking my Ritalin regularly, with a dosage increase. I went from not needing a cig at all, to full-blown, biting-my-nails cravings. I'm restless and cranky. I thought I was out of the danger zone.

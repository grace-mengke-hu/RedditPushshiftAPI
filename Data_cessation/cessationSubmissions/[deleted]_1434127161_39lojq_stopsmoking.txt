I'm on my third day without smokes... is it cheating if I smoke a black and mild throughout the day?

Edit: Everyone, thanks for your input. I have decided I'm going to go cold turkey. I don't want to rely on gum/patches/vaping. However, I am going to look into getting a ecig with the 0mg liquid.. for the oral stimulation. 

Thanks for your tips! 

I ABSOLUTELY can't wait to get some time under my belt. I hate this nasty habit, and I can't believe I ever let it get this out of control. 

As Shia Lebouf said, "If you're tired of starting over, quit giving up." I'm not giving up this time!

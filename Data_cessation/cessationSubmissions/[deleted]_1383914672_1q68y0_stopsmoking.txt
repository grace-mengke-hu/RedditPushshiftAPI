Would getting myself extremely addicted to a video game for a week help me quit? Has anyone tried this?

Or could it have the opposite effect. I know sometime I enjoy taking breaks, but I feel it will occupy my hands and mind. I don't have a lot to do till next Tuesday. So I was thinking of binging. Also buying plenty of healthy food and drinks. 

I'd force myself to be a hermit for five days. But that's okay, my main trigger is seeing people smoke. Which is annoying because all my friends do.

Has anyone tried this before?

If this is a bad idea I'll probably try Alan Carrs book, or nicotine gum.

It's about that time

I'm 19. I've been smoking a pack a day almost like clockwork for maybe a year. The problem is I don't enjoy it. I don't think I ever have. I savored the first cigarette I ever inhaled, like many do, but ever since then or shortly thereafter I think it's really just been an exercise in self loathing. It got out of hand my first year in college when i would be so stoned all the time that smoking cigarettes was the only thing i had the energy to do. I smoke cigarettes the same way I eat junk food, mindlessly dragging them down, not even pretending to enjoy the burning in my esophagus or the horrible smell and taste that lingers. I guess I thought I would quit the cigarettes when I stopped smoking weed. The problem is I never really replaced the habit with anything, so I'm left with more dead time to fill up somehow. Anyway, these are just thoughts I needed to write down. Hopefully they help me or someone else. I'm in New York City now, and the prospect of dropping 11$ every day or two just kicks up some more of that inwardly-focuses aggravation. I haven't quit yet, but I think the camel's back is breaking. Something's gotta give.

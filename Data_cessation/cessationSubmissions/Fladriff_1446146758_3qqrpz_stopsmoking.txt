Here we go.

So, today I have decided after 7 years of smoking, that I am finished. I am (recently) 25 years old, and have been doing some self reflection. I have a strange obsession with mortality, I don't necessarily fear death as much as I fear dying to something that is self inflicted. I want my health back, I want to be a beacon and role model for my friends who smoke. I'm not sure how to quit or what steps I should take, but I'm at a pack a day sometimes more. I have 2 smokes left, any advice would be great.

8 Days, what I love the most...

I smell like my favorite perfume, and Gain laundry detergent. That's it. No cloak of cigarette smoke.

Side note: I had excessive underarm sweat...quitting has completely stopped that by day 8. I'm totally dry. May be gross to some, but this was a terrible problem for me that I didn't know was triggered by my smoking.

Stop smoking no. 27263638373....

I wrote a very long post that I accidentally deleted.

I don't have the energy to rewrite everything, but I'm desperate to just say something. 

Suffice to say that smoking has been an interminable hell for me over the last six years.

It makes me anxious and depressed and not smoking consistently and rapidly improves all areas of my life.

Stopping is easy for me, I do all the time. I also start again, obviously, very easily. I am self sabotaged by the ridiculous seduction that I can stop again very easily. 

This battle has very negatively effected my life, especially,  as I have overwhelming anxious/depressive/nauseating reactions to smoking. 

Anyway I've tried a million different things and they all work! At least in the sense that I can trigger stopping very easily. I'm trying to do something differently recently an that is to consistently reflect, every day, on this battle and hope that I can stop that way, for good!

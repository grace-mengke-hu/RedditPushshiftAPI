Day 6 and feeling great!

Just turned 41 last week and decided to be done after 20 years of on and off smoking about half a pack a day. I used the patch for the first two days and then went to "hot yoga" for the first time, what a difference!! I took the patch off right before the yoga class and haven't put one back on. It's funny because I can't even go in to a sauna without freaking out but it was totally amazing. Just thought I would let people know in case it works for them. Yeah, I still have my cravings, but I'm able to work through them and say "Yoga is going to suck next time if I can't breathe from smoking." Good luck everyone!

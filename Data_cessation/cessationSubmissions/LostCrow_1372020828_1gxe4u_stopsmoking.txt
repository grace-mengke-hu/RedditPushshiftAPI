My 100th day is tomorrow. Some things that I have noticed..

So 99 days ago I made a drunken decision to quit smoking.  I've done this in the past, but this time I decided to stick with it.  In 99 days, I have realized a few things

* I feel fucking great. I started working out everyday again, and I run 5 days a week (though right now I'm on a bit of a break)
* I miss smoking.  The cravings never go away, and I've realized that since I have quit smoking.  But just like an ex-girlfriend, just because you miss it, doesn't mean that you should go back to it. 
* When you quit smoking, you have a shit ton of dreams about smoking.  I have a smoking dream about once a week, and in the dream, I feel so guilty that I smoked a cig, but I wake up feeling relieved. 
* Sadly, I sometimes look for that major life event to start me smoking again.  Something that is so bad that I need a smoke to feel better.  I wish I would stop thinking like this, but it enters my mind about once a week
* I never thought I would make it to 100 days, and I sure as hell don't want to see that number go back to 0.  

So in all, I miss smoking so much, but I'm this far in and I can't go back now.  I also want to thank this subreddit.  Though I've only posted once in here, seeing everyone elses success stories have really motivated me.

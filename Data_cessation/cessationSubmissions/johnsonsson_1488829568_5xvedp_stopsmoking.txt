E-cigarettes. Don't fall into the trap of replacing an addiction with another one!

It is interesting as an ex-smoker to observe smokers and their excuses, their fears, their demons.

Since a couple of months the group of e-cig users grew rapidly in my environment. and all i can see is smoker's denial in its purest form. 
e-cigs are perfectly designed to pump up the consumer all day long without bad conscience. what once started as inhaling burning plant leaves (how stupid is even that) ends up as a sinister chemical cocktail intoxicating your system. total powerlessness, total fail of will. these liquids make you HEAVY addicted on unresearched chemicals and the worst thing is that you can smoke them literally everywhere. they smoke in the cinema now, in non-smoker areas, right next to you without shame. passive smoking won't be a thing until proven otherwise, so the e-cig will find its way back into public after decades of regulations. I see guys having a puff or two every two minutes cause "it's healthy you know". the cigarette creeps back into society in form of a shining little machine.


states all over the world see the cashcow uprising and prepare for taxes. the tobacco industry heavily invests into these products. a philipp-morris executive in an interview a couple of weeks ago said something I want you to think about. take this deeply to your heart. he said: "this century, the common cigarette will get replaced with the e-cigarette." why is he saying that? because they KNOW that they will press even more money out of your pocket! 

remember: you can replace smoking with e-cig but you will still be a junkie who replaced his drug!

in case you are a smoker and you are planning to quit soon, always remember: cold turkey is the only way to cut this gordian knot. stop whining around.

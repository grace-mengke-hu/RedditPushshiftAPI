Dreaming about smoking?

So I rarely use this sub anymore because I have completely lost my desire to smoke... except for in my dreams, apparently.  The dream is usually me hanging out with friends, one of them offering me a cig, and me accepting and saying something like "I haven't had one in so long so it's ok I'll just smoke this one."  I am always very relieved the next day when I realize it was a dream but I find it odd that I am just now starting to have these dreams.  It would make sense if I had just quit and was still feeling the effects of nicotine withdrawal but it's been like 8 months since my last cig.  It makes me fear that I will soon give in to temptation if offered a smoke, maybe I'm reading too far into it. Has anyone else experienced these dreams this far into quitting?

400 days and today I feel bad...

After 400 and something days I feel the cravings coming back... Specially when I drink a bit.
I've been depressed and on meds for more than a year now, but today, specially I feel bad... Fighting with my girlfriend also doesn't help. I just want a pack of cigarretes and a lot of alcohol. 

Just needed to share...

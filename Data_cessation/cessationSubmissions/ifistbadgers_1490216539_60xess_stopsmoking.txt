It's 3pm day one of hopefully a tabacco free life.

So far only mild cravings, i've tried many times.  started over ten years ago when I was 16.  

I've spent about $30,000 on cigarettes roughly since i've started.  I did the math on that the other day when I was trying to budget for a vacation.  

The drive home will be hard, but once I make it home I'm going to hit the bong, have a showerbeer, eat a sandwich and go to bed early. Hopefully day 2 will be sweeter.

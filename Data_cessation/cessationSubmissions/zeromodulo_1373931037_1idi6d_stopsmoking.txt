Ready to quit.

I'm ready to quit smoking. I've posted here a few times, and have received a lot of great advice and resources, and I'd like to say thanks.

Quitting smoking has been long overdue.

I'm beginning to look at cigarettes for what they really are, gross, filthy, disgusting, awful, and poisonous.

Just smoked my last cigarette

I just smoked my hopefully last cigarette at 4.2 12 am.
After that i put some cola in my tobacco pack, to prevent me from smoking it.

Now i want to improve my health by working out regularly.

But i think i need to cut out some friends which are pretty strong smokers, i can't imagine to hangout with them without smoking....

edit: i made a new account because i have some people in my life which never knew i smoked, did this to prevent me to smoke in front of them, even if it doesn't sound like i was smoking long time  but it is 5 years now...
Way too long !!


Edit 24h: It's been 24h since my last one, i feel great :D, i do not feel like i want a cigarette and i started to make some climb ups and push ups

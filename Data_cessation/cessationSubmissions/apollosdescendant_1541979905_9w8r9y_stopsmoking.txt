I get out of the hospital today...

About 12 days ago, I was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism, and I’ve been in the hospital ever since. I’m an overweight smoker working a desk job without much time for physical activity. All of this increases blood clots in your legs that can travel to your lungs and potentially kill you. 

I guess something good that came out of this mess is that I’ve been smoke free for over 12 days now. Going back to my stressful job without cigs kind of terrifies me, but I think I will get some good advice from this sub.

I am done.

Smoker for 5 years here.

Yesterday I lay in my bed and thought about how shitty my life is because i am a smoker. Good ... I woke up and bought a pack. After I smoked this one cig I went full angry. I broke all 19 cigs in half, every time I said to myself "You are strong. How can you let fucking tobacco beat you? You are much stronger." I almost screamed it 19 times.

8h later I wanted to fish 2 halfs out of the trash to smoke them. I did not, instead I got very very angry again. Super sayan angry. I made myself a green tea, invited a friend for the evening and listened to a 1h youtube hypnosis which helped a lot. I played some gamecube and had 2 beer. Both ultra trigger. Had no wish for a cig.

Going to sleep now , afraid I get nightmares again. Have them all the time when I try to quit this shit addiction. But after 10 attempts I feel different. Something clicked and something changed. I will never ever be that guy again that tried to fish a cig out of the trash.

I am done with smoking. And I will try to help everyone here to do so too. We don't need this. We are not made for this.

Stay strong.

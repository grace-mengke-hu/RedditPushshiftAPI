When will this feeling pass?

So I have finally got serious about quitting after 20 years. Not going too bad at all, about 3-4 weeks in now. I am finding it hard to look forward to things that I normally look forward to doing because I know that I can't enjoy a cigarette as well. Any tips on how long this feeling tends to stick around for and how to look past it?

Alternatives and questions for you all.

Hey all, respect your efforts to quit I understand just how difficult it is.

I’m currently working on a project that from a medical standpoint may help people come off cigarettes and can act as an alternative.

May I ask a few questions: 

1. Why more don’t use vapes?

2. Is the flavour of cigarettes pleasant to you? 

3. Do you tend to crave the actual act of smoking in a certain position (associated e.g smoking on your back porch at night as a way to relax) or just smoking in general.

This is coming from someone who’s smoked on and off for the last few years and is working in the medical field.

If you feel the questions are insulting or obvious in anyway I apologise, just trying to gather information. Thank you very much for your time.

Three weeks!

Today is a pretty big achievement for me. I've been smoking since I was 22 (turning 27 soon). I would smoke occasionally in college then had one difficult class in my senior year that made me buy a pack of cigarettes. Ended up with a little over half a pack a day habit since then. A few months ago I was on a smoke break at work and realized I just didn't enjoy it any more. Finally reached the point where I had half a pack of cigarettes left and said "I'm not buying any more." I ended up saying that out loud to two of my best friends who don't smoke and they encouraged that decision, so I knew I couldn't turn back on my word.

Thankfully, people at work are very encouraging. I've been given toothpicks, coffee stirrers, and suckers galore from several office mates to help me kick the habit. I also stopped going out with the smokers on breaks. Until this past week when one of the smokers (who works in a different part of the building) said they missed me on break. I decided to go back out. I brought coffee and a toothpick with me. I realized the smell wasn't that appealing and I didn't miss the smoking. I am never going to avoid smokers, but now I am comfortable hanging around a few knowing that I'm not going to try and bum one.

I've heard it takes about three weeks to start a new habit or break a current habit. I don't know how true it is, but after three weeks, I don't really feel the urge to light up again. I also went cold turkey. The first week was major suckage, and parts of the second week were edgy, but the third week was a lot easier.

Besides the motivation from friends and co-workers, that stupid little badge on the side of the page is helping. I was really looking forward to reaching the three week mark. Now I'm looking forward to hitting the one month mark, so I wanted to thank this sub-reddit for those moments I thought I'd give in, but decided to pick up my phone and read your stories instead.

Day 12

Been smoking on and off for 13 years. I’m 25. Don’t want to end up like my friends grandma. Sometimes I feel like smoking one just cause “I’m still young” which just makes it harder to remain smoke free lol.  But I’m on day 12 of no ciggies and trying not to lose the battle. Good luck to others going through something similar.

Did anyone else experience this?

Hey all. I've successfully reached fourteen days quit (woo!). While I'm super stoked about this and so proud of myself, these last few days have been hard to enjoy because I'm so nauseous. No part of my routine is different besides having quit the cigs. So my question is, even though it's been a decent while since I've smoked, is it normal that I'm SO nauseous? I'm just trying to figure out what's causing this. Thanks :)

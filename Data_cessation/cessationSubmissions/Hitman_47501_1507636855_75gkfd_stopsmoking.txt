Never think you are out of the woods...

I have to shamefully admit that I have to reset the badge that I have so proudly wore for the last 3 months... I have been smoking a pack a day for the last 15 years! I turn 26 next month, and I can't stand the taught that I'm so weak to grab this filthy habit again. Quitting was one of the hardest things I  have ever done, 1 month straight never had a good sleep, sweating all the time, depression etc. After that all came to a normal way, sleep improved, appetite, energy levels and even my mindset! While I was on vacation, being so happy i was able to quit, a wild and dark taught enters my mind... to test myself and see how will i react now after 2 months from quitting? Slow but steady I came back to my demon, now I feel only empty inside, feeling I failed myself like never before! Don't follow the path i walked, do like they say in AA, once out never walk in again! Good luck to you all in you'r journey and stay healthy!

17 days streaks and dealing with it

Hi, just wanted to warn everyone about the pleasant-self-excusing thouht: ‚one little ciggy wouldn’t harm’ - errrr NO, as it means you will do it OVER AND OVER AGAIN. And then again you are trapped. 

I have made many attempts to quit - these thoughts always come around 3rd 4th wk and - if i light it up then again i smoke next 3-4 months until the next try.

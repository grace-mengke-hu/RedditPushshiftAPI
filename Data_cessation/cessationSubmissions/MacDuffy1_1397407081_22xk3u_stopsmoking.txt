Drinking and Smoking.

Hey guys i'm just writing here as feel like I've kicked smoking but not when I'm drinking. It may be because i started smoking when drinking only, and then went on from there. Also being that Smoking is banned in bars in the UK its quite a social event popping out for a fag with your friends. and you always bump into your friends entering or leaving a pub/club/bar while they are smoking. That feeling waking up on a Saturday morning smelling of stale smoke, makes that hangover all the more shameful. Besides it being a will power issue which i seem to lack after a few bevs, are there any tips for relieving the need to smoke when drinking? Cheers =)

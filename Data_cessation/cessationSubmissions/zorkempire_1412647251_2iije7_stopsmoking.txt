Today makes 3 years of no smoking, and I owe a lot of my success to r/stopsmoking. Get a badge and start stopping!

Make sure to request a badge when you quit. For the past three years, every few months, I've returned /r/stopsmoking to see my numbers grow in the sidebar.

I REALLY didn't want to reset that badge. Each time I checked, I read over a few posts and remembered why I had quit and why I was going to stay quit. 

This is just a quick note to say thanks for this community. 

Good luck to those who are quitting. GET YOUR BADGE!

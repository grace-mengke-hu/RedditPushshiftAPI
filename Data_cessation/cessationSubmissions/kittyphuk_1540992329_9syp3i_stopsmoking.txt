Haven’t smoked in two days but tempting to go back because of weight gain? Any quitters gain weight? If so, how much and what did you do to prevent fat/appetite?

I miss the soft texture on my face or let’s just say my life in general with no smoking involved. I almost envy someone when they tell me they don’t smoke. I want to stop and I need to stop finding excuses to put that cig in my mouth.

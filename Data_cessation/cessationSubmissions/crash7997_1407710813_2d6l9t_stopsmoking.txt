planning to quit, but have to deal with irrational rage

I have tried to quit smoking a few times before.  I have been smoking since I was 14 and now I find myself 35 and unable to do the things I used to without getting winded.  I want to be healthy again (also I have Crohn's Disease, so that complicates matters).  My biggest stumbling block has been this irrational rage that comes over me for absolutely no reason.  The last time I attempted to quit, It had only been about 8 hours and I was sitting in the living room and I had an overwhelming desire to throw my computer through the television.

One last further complication is I work with an absolute bitch and she does everything she can to make my life more difficult and I am afraid that if she sets me off while I am in one of these moods I am going to do something I regret (nothing physical, but I can certainly see a barrage of four letter words being thrown her way).  

How do I go about quitting knowing that this is a major factor.  I feel like if I can get past this, the rest will be a bit more downhill for me.

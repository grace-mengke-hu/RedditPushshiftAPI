Quit 2 Days Ago / Drinking Cravings

I had my last cig 2 days ago, and it's all sorta reminding me why I changed from a rare smoker into a dozen a day smoker- to keep my drinking cravings at bay. Now I've quit smoking, the combination of the two are killing me. I wouldn't crave drinking too much because I was smoking. I used to drink heavily like every single day, then managed to get it down to a normal, casual amount, because I had smoking to keep me going. Now I feel all the cravings from then flooding back. I recently posted about my depression on top of it, which I use(d) drinking and smoking to deal with, and seriously, I feel frantic without either anymore. I'm not sure if this is a rant or a question, just wondered if anyone has had anything else like this going on before

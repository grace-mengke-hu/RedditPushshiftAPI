About to hit 1 month - e-cig questions

Was a smoker for far too long and on 11/12/13 I decided to quit.   I went out and got an e-cig with 12mg nic juice.   I have to say, it was much easier than I thought.   My plan is to ultimately reduce the nicotine over time (just purchased my first bottle of 6mg nic juice) down to nothing and then work on eliminating the e-cig.

I would like to know how this has worked for others out there?  I realize that every situation is different, but so far, it's working very well for me.

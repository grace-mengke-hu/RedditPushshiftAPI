How has it been 71 days?

Honestly, quitting has been easy for me. I have been vaping 6 mg, but hey everyone moves at their own pace and I still find comfort in nicotine. I can never imagine getting my nicotine rush from a cigarette ever again. Recently, I was sick with bronchitis and it didn’t feel as if I were dying, my chest did not burn and I did not feel heavy in the chest. I recovered from it easier even though I’m still on Advair. I remember getting sick when smoking and I thought I was dying, and coughing up a lung. I thought to myself, this would be my life if I never quit, a never ending cycle of coughing and wheezing... Quitting was the best thing I ever did.

Where I used to keep my smokes, more in the comments.

In just a few days it will be 4 years since I've quit. I smoked since I was 11 (because everyone in class did). Since I was 13 I smoked a pack and in the end, I averaged 3 packs per day.  

I only learned about this the day after, but the day I've quit, they increased the price to 5Eur per pack. 4 years are 1,460 days and at 15eur per day, that's 21,900Eur. They actually increased the prices even further since then, so it's actually more than that. If I would have put every cent aside, I could afford a brand new VW Golf or a used Porsche now.

I know money is a big factor for a lot of people, so I hope this will motivate someone. In terms of money, it's immediately noticeable, even if you just smoke one pack per week, that's still 260Eur per year or so. It really isn't THAT hard, at the moment it may feel tough, but after just a month you'll wonder why you didn't do it a lot sooner. Pro-Tip: Quit in evening after dinner and motivate yourself in the morning, by telling yourself that you already managed half a day, tell yourself that it's an achievement and that you don't want to go through it ever again. With every day I had more to look back upon and I used it to motivate myself. I also once smoked nicotine free cigarettes, which helped in a weird way, because it did absolutely nothing, but it gave me a very strong sense of smoking being absolutely useless. Also try to stay away from nicotine patches and so on, it's exactly what you want to get rid of. I never looked back.

Day 2

So today is day 2 . So far so good. I've had cravings but I tell myself I don't need it and go on about my business. The worst times for me are while driving, after eating, and during work. I work a boring office job and smoking was what I'd do when I got bored . I do carry a pack with me . I don't know why but having them there makes me feel better . Like they're there if I need them but I'm happy every second that passes and the pack is still sealed shut . I have been trying the chocolate trick as well. Took some bite sized Snickers to work yesterday and every time I thought I wanted a cigarette I just started eating them to keep myself occupied. But over all I feel great I just wish I could stop thinking about it and go on like I never smoked a cigarette in my life. Also anyone thinking about quitting this subreddit is a great place to start reading everyone else's journeys makes it better you see all kinds of things to expect and have people giving you great advice and encouragement and you feel like your not struggling alone. â™¡

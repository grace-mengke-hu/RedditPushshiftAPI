Vape vs cigarettes

I'm 32 days cigarette free!!! And I've been using a phix vape to control my urges. I puff on it a lot and plan to slow down when the time is right. I read online how vaping is so much better for you than smoking. But also read it's as dangerous as smoking. For me, I feel a million times better vaping then I ever did smoking. I can breath normally and work out just fine. What are your thoughts?????

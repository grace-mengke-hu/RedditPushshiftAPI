Fighting with SO over his smoking becoming more frequent

My partner is a smoker and had been for ~10 years.  We have been together for ~1.5, and he has smoked the whole time.  Smoking is/(was) a deal breaker for me, but based on how our relationship formed it wasn't really an option.

Basically, his smoking is starting to become more and more of an issue to me.  When I am inside cleaning, and he is outside chain smoking, I get depressed and angry.  When we wake up and he rushes outside first thing instead of saying good morning, I get depressed and angry.  When we are in the car and he lights a cigarette, I get depressed and angry.  When I lean in for a kiss at night and he can't kiss back because he has dip in...  It's gotten to the point where I get upset even seeing other smokers, because it reminds me of my partner's addiction.

He was supposed to quit last year and didn't.  He says he is going to quit this summer, but I have zero confidence in him.  Less than zero.  I think about leaving him over it regularly.  His cigarettes are the most important thing in his life, and it is debilitatingly depressing to me.

Not really a question, I just needed to rant.  Any advice would be much appreciated.

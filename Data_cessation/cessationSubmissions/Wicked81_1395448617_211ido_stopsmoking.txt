I hate smoking. . . HELP!

I want to quit - I have quit before (once for 3 1/2 yrs, then for about 2 months) and I felt SO much better.  I didn't gain weight, I had NO negative effects from quitting.  WHY can't I JUST stop doing this??? I have quit drinking, quit doing heroin but I just CAN'T get a grip on this. . . :(

Thank fuck that was a dream!

Was dreaming about smoking (again). In my dream it started off with me smoking when i was drunk. The next day in my dream I was fighting off cravings when I was sober until I couldn't take it anymore and smoked another. The worst part was that it was fucking so enjoyable! The dream was so vivid and felt so real. I'm on Champix at the moment. Would it be them causing these really realistic dreams, or does it happen everyone that stops smoking?

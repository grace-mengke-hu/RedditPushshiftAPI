Funeral today

Today I will attend a funeral of a woman my age, 53, way too young to die. She was a die hard smoker, so die hard she had a lung removed and continued to smoke.  My friend, Anne, was never able to quit. Some people are unable to find the resolve to get through the withdrawal period and never get to see how much sweeter life is on the other side.  It is a testament to how strong nicotine addiction is that someone who had a lung removed would continue to smoke.  It is also sad to me how many times I have heard among those she left behind, "she brought it on herself".  

Where ever you are in your quit, do not lose sight that this is a fight for your life.  Nicotine is an evil drug.

almost a week

I smoked for 20 years (it seems crazy to say that).  I've talked about quitting several times but never actually tried.  I cut back and said that was better or was moving towards quitting but never took that final step.  A few weeks ago I downloaded the Smoke Free app on my phone (which is what brought me here).  After a few days of playing with the app I decided to push myself, see how long I could go without one.  It's been 6 days and 7 hours.  I was doubtful that an app could help me quit but it works surprisingly well.  Anytime I get a craving I open the app and look at my progress and it helps me push through.  I've also been watching this video (sometimes several times a day)  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnSEbLX94Tk&amp;list=WL&amp;index=8&amp;t=0s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnSEbLX94Tk&amp;list=WL&amp;index=8&amp;t=0s)  I found what she says about the mind not taking negative commands very helpful.  Maybe it will help someone else too.

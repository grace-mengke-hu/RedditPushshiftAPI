Officially on 7 day mark, digestive problems from withdrawal hurt though

Successfully made it to a week. I can say with confidence that I haven't particularly craved cigarettes or nicotine after about day 4 of cutting nicotine out cold Turkey.

The downside is that I'm getting other physical withdrawal symptoms. Constant feeling of being bloated, bad indigestion and constipation have all hit me after about the 3rd or 4th day of having no nicotine.

I searched up common nicotine withdrawal symptoms and almost all of them list digestive problems as one of them.

For people that been through this - what did you do to help ease it? I've been close to bed-ridden for the past couple of days, just feeling really lethargic too. Stomach is uncomfortable every waking hour and can't even tell the difference between bloated or hungry anymore. 

Dunno how long the digestive problems will go but I'm assuming its my body trying to make adjustments still.

Feedback appreciated.

Thanks all

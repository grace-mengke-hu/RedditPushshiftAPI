5 days and craving

I haven't had a smoke since last Thursday and I'm getting wicked cravings right now. You know when your jaw gets tight and you feel stringy...I'm really wantin to go buy. A single cigar from the store to smoke instead if a pack of cigs but I know it's a dumb idea. I keep thinking its better because its only 1 and not a pack of 25.

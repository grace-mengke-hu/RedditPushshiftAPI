Day two begins

Approximately 30 hours ago, my dad and i were having an argument and he told me i couldn't use my phone or anything related to the internet after 12 pm so as to sleep early.
After arguing for a while he got angry and told me well you know what you can have the internet but quit smoking, after being confused for a couple seconds, i agreed and put both the empty pack i had and the one with 2 cigs on his desk along with my 2 lighters.
It feels like there are spider webs inside my head and it's stopping me from thinking clearly, there's this constant itch and i want to smoke so badly, just 1 cigarette will fix this.
But i know that's not true, the cravings hurt so bad and i have tests coming up and i almost didn't decide to quit cause 'i have tests coming up', the same way we all make excuses at every point in life, an excuse during stress, sadness, and even happiness.
How long till the cravings go away? Till my head feels normal and i can think properly and i'm not so tired all the time? I don't know.
But i want your personal experiences, i want to know what to expect and how to deal with it all, cause at every instance of stress i know i'll crave another puff, just one more cig.

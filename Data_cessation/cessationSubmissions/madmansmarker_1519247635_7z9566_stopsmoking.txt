Starting my Instructor Diver Course March 7th, want to have not been smoking for at least a week by then.

Strong lungs are kiiiiinda necessary to teach diving and to be healthy in general. The fact is, I love diving more than I like smoking so I absolutely have to quit.   
Today is my second day but only because I was hungover yesterday and never smoke when I’m hungover. I would say “just get drunk and be hungover for a week straight!” but i smoke too much when I drink.   
What has helped you to quit and not eat a bunch of food instead? I have fruit on standby just in case...  
Also, does anyone have any stories of being a diver before/after quitting cigarettes?   
Thanks!

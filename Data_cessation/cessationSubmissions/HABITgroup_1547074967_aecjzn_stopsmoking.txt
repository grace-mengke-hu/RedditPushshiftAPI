Hey. Are you someone recently diagnosed with cancer who is trying to quit smoking? Here is a resource available.

Heyy. I work with a research team at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center that specializes in smoking cessation. We have developed a quit smoking resource for cancer patients. Smoking can be such a comforting thing, and especially in the super stressful time after a diagnosis, but it effects cancer treatment and outcome. Quitting smoking can be one of the best things you can do to support cancer treatment. That's why we've developed an app, that we are testing in a scientific pilot research trial. Let us know if you have any questions or know anyone who may be interested.

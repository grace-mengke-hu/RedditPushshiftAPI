10 days free! I feel terrible...

Today is my 10th day without a cigarette. I've decided that cold turkey was the right option for me. I was a pack a day smoker for 4 years so my struggles are probably weak compared to some older and longer smokers. The W/D Symptoms are kicking my ass but i'm holding out.

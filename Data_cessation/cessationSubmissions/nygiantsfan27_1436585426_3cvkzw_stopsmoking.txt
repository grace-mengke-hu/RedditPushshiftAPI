Need advice. Please help !

Hello everyone! 
I have been following this sub for a few months now and it has helped me make the decision to quit. I have found this very hard to do and have been trying to slowly cut down on my smoking before fully quitting. I have smoked for about 5 years, at the very most smoking 1-2 packs a week. Lately I only smoke every few days and have even done a week without smoking at all. I have started wheezing at night when I am trying to sleep and it has gotten me very worried. Does this mean I have damaged my lungs or is this a way of them healing? I do not cough very much but the wheezing has me very worried, to the point where i am now ready to never touch a cig again. I am 25 years old and was wondering if anyone could give me some advice/ words of wisdom. Thanks in advance :)

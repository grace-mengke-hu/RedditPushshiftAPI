How I quit smoking; any thoughts or opinions?

A year ago I heard about electronic cigarettes and thought it would be a great way to cut back on smoking, so I decided to see what all the fuss was about. I had worked my way up to almost a pack a day and was really starting to worry about my health and the effect on my wallet. So I bought one of those blu type e-cigs, the one that looks like an actual cigarette. I used it for a couple days/weeks and eventually it went in my drawer never to be seen again.

I went back to almost a pack a day and a couple weeks ago through /r/stopsmoking I found /r/electronic_cigarette. After lurking for a good while I made a decision to purchase one of their recommendations. It has been three weeks since I've been using this thing and the thought of smoking a cigarette hasn't even crossed my mind. I don't think I'll ever go back to smoking cigarettes at this point, I just can't see myself doing it. The initial up front cost is about the same as a carton of cigarettes, but after that the cost of continued use is extremely low, maybe 15-20 dollars a month. 

I'm extremely happy with my decision to switch and would recommend this to anybody. If anybody has any questions on the setup I purchased I'd be happy to share.

Has anybody else used this method? What are your thoughts?

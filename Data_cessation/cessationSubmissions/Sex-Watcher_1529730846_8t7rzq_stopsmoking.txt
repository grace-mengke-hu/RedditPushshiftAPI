Haven't had a cig since 11/7/11 and I am craving.

Want one more than ever right now.  Was hanging out with a fellow employee today that is really successful and they were smoking a cig.  Reminded me of the way I used to smoke and then flick the cig off my figertips into the distance.  

I want a cig so fucking bad right now...  Make me stop!!!

I slipped a little, but I don't know if I should???

reset my badge or leave it as for one thing, I didn't fully inhale the cigarette. I know what I did and felt bad over it all. It was being at the friends' yard that sent it to hell. Back to do it again. REMINDER, I never inhaled it into my lungs, just had it in my mouth and felt little effect from the nicotine.

Damn, it was as if my dream foretold this.

6 months nicotine free some thoughts

Start smoking at 12, quit at 26, I was chain smoker, sometimes in the morning I use to smoke 3 or 4 cigs one after another, this is how addicted I was. I quit because my throat was feel so irritated, I couldn't even breath normal sometimes and I knew it, I have to quit... so I quit cold turkey.

Positive sides:

- My energy has increased twice, sometimes I am wondering from where I got too much energy but actually this is how should be normal. Even my friends somtimes tell me I have more energy while I talk.

- Face skin looks better, eye wrinkles are much smaller. I blame the premature wrinkles because I start smoking at very young age but now is amazing how much my skin has repaired.

- Lung capacity is twice now. I can fill my lungs with air twice now, this is how my lungs was affected, I can breath normally now.

- Smell/taste are back, is amazing to feel the smell of flowers while you walk in park or while I'm driving my car from city to city, that country smell brings memories when I was a kid. After I get addicted to smoking, the smell has lost, but you think is normal because the process of losing smell is slowly.

- Teeth got a little bit whiter. The lips, tongue and gums are pink now, the tissue in this area wasn't looking so good after 15 years of smoking, they were kind of red/blue but now they are pink.

- I sleep better, I fall alsleep much easier and I wake up early in the morning and I'm not staying lazy in the bed after I wake up like I use to do.

- It feel nice to go at gas station without buying cigs.

- I still spit almost every morning from throat while I am coughing, mucus with tar and sometimes is black(like burn oil from engine), somtimes is brown, sometimes is green.

- I saved about +1000$.

- Almost complety forget I was a smoker... almost... I was so afraid of this but it gets better month by month. 


Negative sides:

- Depression in first 2 months but it gets better, sometimes you are out of energy... staying in bed looking on walls hoping it will pass... but it will.

- Your gums are bleeding in the morning, you have mouth full of blood. We all know that cigs affects your blood circulation so when you quit, the vessels are going to heal and the fact you spit blood is a good sign, means blood reach areas where in the past while you smoking does not.

- Sometimes when I have nothing to do, I remember in these situations I use to smoke and a nostalgic mood hits you... but it gets better, you are thinking much less than a few months ago.

This wasn't my first attempt... I tried e-cigs too...didn't work... I tried also "a few" cigs per day... there is no safe cigs per day and so on.... you quit or not. You decide if you want a healthy life style or not. Looking back, how I feel now... man there is no way going back to smoke again... I'm done

Decided I am a quitter months ago, realized im a puss today.

Ive been "Actively" trying to quit for months, on and off. ive been smoking since I was 15, Im 19 now. My girlfriend is absolutely amazing, hasnt even asked me to quit once or given any sort of ultimatum and she is being amazingly supportive through it all. I need to quit, for health reasons and out of self respect, and tomorrow will be my first time quitting something addictive with the Reddit community behind my back. 

Im giving this one my all, for the sake of things I hold dear including my own dignity, If I cannot quit something millions of people have already then I surely will never get as far as I want to in life. I am going to the doctors in a few hours to see about some nicotine patches to take the edge off. 

The main issue is severe anxiety, which is exacerbated by nicotine withdrawal, and lately nicotine has been depressing me for a short period after each cigarette.

Anyone have any suggestions? I have an e-cig I will also keep on hand. Any words you have are welcomed, thank you :)

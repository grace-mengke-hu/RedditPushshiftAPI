Don't want to preach...

....but I feel great after 18 days smoke free. I read the Allan Carr book and went for it cold turkey. I just want to tell all my smoking friends how great I feel and how relatively easy it was. I had a 10 year, 15 a day habit, and now....Nada! Luckily they take it with a pinch of salt, and we have a joke about me being 'that guy', but how do any of you avoid being the preachy ex smoker? I just want my friends to feel the same benefits as me, lol.

I quit a year ago but everytime I drink, I relapse

A year ago I decided to quit smoking. It was tough, eating a lot to compensate the cravings, having to go for a walk while at parties... For 6 weeks I didn't have any cigarette.
I was really proud of myself, and did not even want a cigarette. 
But if I had few drinks, the cravings where still there and strong. So on night out, I relapsed. It was just one, so I didn't feel to bad the day after. But since then every time I have two or more drinks, I feel a strong craving and I give in. Sometimes I could even smoke 10-15 cigarettes.
This routine had been going on since then. But yesterday I got sick of it. My goal is to be cigarette free, not feeling cravings just like when I am sober.
I ask for my badge and start my counter.

Any tips or encouragement will be greatly appreciated :)

Good luck to all of you and feel free to message me if you want more infos or tips

Tips for helping my boyfriend quit. Is cold turkey the way to go?

I'm looking for advice to help my boyfriend quit smoking. He's been smoking for around 5 years and he's only 20. So far since around the start of May he's been trying to quit but he hasn't been going cold turkey. He recently bought a pack and he's had around 3-4 cigarettes a day in comparison to the last few weeks when he's only had around 2 a week (that I know of). Even when he started to 'quit' a month or so ago, he didn't tell his coworkers and friends so when they'd offer him a cigarette, he would take it. I feel that he can't quit until he goes cold turkey but I have absolutely no experience about quitting smoking. I have smoked but I'm definitely not addicted and I only have like 1 cigarette ever 2 months, if anything. 

I'd love to here from you guys and from the people who went cold turkey and how they coped. I've read that in some countries cigarettes are very expensive but we live in England where you can get a pack for around Â£8 so cigarettes are easily available for him. We also don't live together which doesn't help. 

We've also spoken about Nicorette gum so if anyone has had any experience with that I would love to know! 

He does want to quit, I don't want to sound like I'm trying to change him, I'm just so worried about him. Thank you in advance for your answers!

Wheezing?

So tonight for some reason, after 2 hours of sleep my body decides, that is enough for you and now I am awake.  That aside, when I woke up I noticed that I was wheezing.  Being a computer tech, my first thought was to do a google search and all the info seems to point to the fact that I have either asthma or bronchitis, or possibly both.  I thought I would post in here and see if anyone else went through post smoking wheezing within the first week or so.

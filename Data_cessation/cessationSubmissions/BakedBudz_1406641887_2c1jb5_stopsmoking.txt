I started again

So I'm going to have to reset my badge soon. I started smoking again after a really good run. I read Alan Carr's book and had myself convinced that I was a non smoker. However, I failed on one of the most important concepts. There is no such thing as an occasional cigarette. 

I had a few when I was drinking with some buddies of mine. Then I started smoking only when I was as drunk. Then it was when I was hungover. Next thing I knew I'm buying packs again. 

I'm going to quit these death sticks again. As soon as the timing is right for me. I will never quit quitting.

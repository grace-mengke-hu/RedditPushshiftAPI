Ex-Smokers: Did you notice an increase in energy levels?

So many posts I see from people who have managed to stay quit for some time say how much "better" they feel. 

I'm particularly curious about the energy levels of a non-smoker. I've smoked a pack a day for 15+ years... since I was 15-16, so I don't really know what it feels like not to smoke. I struggle pretty regularly with extremely low energy levels which I sometimes think are just normal adult tired feelings, but at other times suspect may be related to some depression or perhaps just the results of long-term smoking. For the majority of my days, by the time I get to my car after work (sometimes long before that), I'm a slug and it's an effort to move, an effort even to speak. No stopping by the grocery store on the way home like I know I need to... WAY too much effort to just get out of the car and get into the store. A silly example, but hopefully someone gets what I'm saying. 

So, does anyone identify with this? Especially ex-smokers... anyone with this experience who had an increase in energy levels after quitting?

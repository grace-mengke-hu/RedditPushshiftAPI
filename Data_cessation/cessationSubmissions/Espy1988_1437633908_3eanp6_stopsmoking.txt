In need of some encouragement/advice.

I'm 25 years old. Been smoking since I was 20. I'm not a heavy smoker. A pack lasts me 3-4 days...not that it makes any difference, I'm still addicted and find it hard to stay quit. In the past I've quit for a couple months and felt fine but found a reason to start again. Most other quits didn't last more than a week. 

In a months time I'm about to move abroad to start a new great job and while I'm eager to start anew (started exercising, meditating and trying to quit smoking) I'm also scared out of my mind (don't know anyone there, leaving my friends behind, need to get a place to live, learn how to get around the city). I quit for 3 days but tonight I went out at 2 am and bought a pack and smoked a cigarette. I know smoking will not alleviate my anxiety or help in any way but I can't let go of the idea that maybe it'll be better if I kept smoking till I'm still here and try to quit when I've moved and got everything figured out. I feel so damn guilty for having smoked ...because I genuinely thought I was done for good. I don't want the cancer, the wrinkles, the fatigue and all the other ailments that smoking causes and I know quitting will be just as hard whether I do it now or in a year. But whenever I feel anxious I go back to smoking. I start out feeling sure and keep at it even if I feel bad but the smallest excuse gets me back to smoking in a moment of weakness.  Definitely going to try to quit again soon. Any advice on how to stay calm and happy would be appreciated.

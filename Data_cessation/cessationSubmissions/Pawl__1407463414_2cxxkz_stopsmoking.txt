Day 30 - Got my star!

And I'm super proud. Just some tips below on my achievements and improvement.

- I've been around drinking people who were heavily smoking. Not even one craving. I was drinking too.
- My resting heart rate is now down to 60bpm.
- I can run over 4km, and now I'm working on improving my pace. I can feel improvement from one workout to another.
- Physical recovery, during working out and between days is much better. Can't really describe it but it feels super humanly amazing to me.
- I'm calmer, more focused, less stressed, more energetic, faster, stronger.
- I'm over â‚¬150 richer already.
- My sclera (eyes) are now actually white.
- My teeth are getting whiter too.
- At the end of a long shift, I still smell good (Old Spice!).

Oh there's probably more too. Currently 4am here during a night shift and after my shift is done I'm going home and I will go for a jog before sleeping. Something I never thought of doing before as a smoker.

Those are some advantages I can think of right now - and no disadvantages of not smoking what so ever in sight. 

I'm fully determined to keep the quit and I know that induced cues can creep up on me; I feel confident I have the better control over them to remain smoke free.

TLDR; lots of benefits, no downsides at all. Whilst it's not easy to quit, it's certainly easier then I would've imagined.

Here's to healthier months ahead of me!

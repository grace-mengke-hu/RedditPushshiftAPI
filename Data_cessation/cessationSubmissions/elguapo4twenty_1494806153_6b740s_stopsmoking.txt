10 Tips That Helped Me Quit

Biggest advice learned so far:
1. Read Allen Carr's book
2. Stop taking any form of nicotine
3. Have a friend who doesn't smoke and supports your decision to quit enough to be there for you 
4. List all your triggers (drinking, socializing, driving, etc)
5. Avoid any situation that involves too many triggers at first
6. After a couple days try and make it through your biggest trigger with your supportive friend but only allow there to be one trigger at a time. 
7. After another couple of days make it through another trigger with your supportive friend. 
8. Remind yourself that if you complain too much about quitting during the first week then the odds of you complaining too much in the future will be higher.
9. Enjoy your sexual performance increase
10. Re-read Allen Carr's book.

I've been Nicotine Free for 16 days and the biggest thing I did different on this quit is respecting my triggers and make it through each one by itself. Drinking alcohol is by far my biggest trigger so my friend who doesn't smoke and I would drink a couple beers at my apartment and he helped me get through it. Then on another day we would go to a bar for an hour only. When my girlfriend and I got into a fight he would come hang out and helped me not think about going to the store and buying a pack. The more triggers I made it through the more confident I get. I just imagine it as training my subconscious mind as if it was a dog and that it's not going to get nicotine when a trigger happens so it needs to stop getting excited. 

Hope this helps out someone !

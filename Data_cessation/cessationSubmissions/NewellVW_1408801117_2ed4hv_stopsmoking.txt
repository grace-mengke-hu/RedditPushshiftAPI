Anybody try e-cigs?

Tomorrow will be one month smoke free using e-cigs! Smoked 45 years, tried everything possible over the years and this was the quickest and easiest I ever did! Go here http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/new/
and check it out, it does work. Good luck to all, I know how hard it is!

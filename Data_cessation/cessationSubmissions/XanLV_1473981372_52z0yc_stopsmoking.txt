How have you improved physically after you stopped smoking?

So I've stopped smoking for some... Days now. Today a man smoked near me while I was eating and I thought of it just as an annoyance. Only after a few hours I realized I did not crave for a smoke at that moment, was just mildly annoyed. 

Now, many people talk about the good long term effects of not smoking. Yeah, not dying is nice, but if we, the smokers, cared about that, we would have never started. So I want to look at the short term positive things that people who dropped just recently can see happening with themselves. Something to give a boost. Something to look forward to. So instead of thinking about the craving, you can look forward to. And I really do not care about "monoxlebelindeens leaving your body" as I do not know how they feel or look like. People who lose weight can see themselves shrinking, but what do we have? What did you observe?

I have noticed that I don't ant to commit small scale genocide every morning. The smoke that "got me through the morning part" was actually the thing that made me so mean and grumpy. So whatever has left the body there has had a very, very strong impact on my life. It is like I have an hour or two added to my life.

Also, mucus. I had to spit fairly often. Usually I woke up in the mornings because I could not really breath and spitting was always the first thing on my mind. I can't say that is entirely gone, but the damn slime factory has slowed down significantly.

Slip up on Day 4! Ugghhhhh

Soooooo I was really craving one last night and pushed through, but I was so agitated. So this morning I caved and had one. I literally could not stand it any longer. I’m using patches but I swear it doesn’t seem to get me through the day. It’s like from 6pm to bedtime I’m struggling so bad. I just bought the lozenges so we will see if those work better.

1 year ago I made the change.

Hi, so I'm a huge lurker of this sub.  I happen to think it's one of the more inspirational subs. So 1 year ago 366 days (not 365 because February had an extra day this year) I quit smoking. I've read post on this subject almost every day to help motivate myself. Now let me help you. 

If you think you can't stop, you're wrong you can!  One of the key things to quitting is the desire to quit. I had smoked for almost 14 years. I started when I was 15. At one point in my life I was smoking 2 packs a day. I also work in the Hospitality Industry where everyone smokes. I've been surrounded by smoke everyday. I hustle keep reminding myself why I want to quit smoking and reading this sub.

If I can do it, you can do it! 

See you in 365 days to celebrate year number 2!

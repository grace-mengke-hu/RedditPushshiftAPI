Is this confidence just a false bravado?

It's been a little over 72 hours since I had my last cigarette. When I got my last pack, I had my usual bout of personal shame and the "I'll quit after this pack" thoughts. But instead of buying another after that one ran out, I decided I wouldn't give in. I actually started smoking before I started driving, so it's been part of my driving experience since day one, and I've been uncomfortable on my commute because of that. But other than while driving, I haven't found it very difficult to resist buying cigarettes, or even bumming one off a coworker.

Will that disappear, after my brain's gone without it for a while? Like, will the cravings get more severe? I've been biting my nails, something I haven't done since high school, but other than that I haven't noticed any new or unpleasant habits forming.

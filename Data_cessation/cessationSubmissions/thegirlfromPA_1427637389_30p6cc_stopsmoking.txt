curious about pot smoking...

I used to be a heavy pot smoker... oh, maybe 6-7 years ago. To the tune of my SO and I going through more than an ounce or week, sometimes more. We always smoked bowls and now and then a joint... never mixed with tobacco. In fact, I'd never really realized folks mixed pot with tobacco until reading this sub. Is this common? Just among tobacco smokers or all pot smokers? 

I am not at all against smoking weed, I just choose not to these days. It made me terribly lazy and paranoid, though I smoked on the daily for about 12 years. I wonder though, does smoking weed make you crave cigarettes? I think it would me, since I always smoked a cigarette in between hits off my bowl. 

Yes, this is me babbling again... though just because I am curious this time, not because I am craving (hooray!)

Day 3. Struggling to quit 'for myself'.

Hey guys, 

So I started smoking at Uni, aged, 18, i'm 27 now and work in mental health. I've always been better at looking after other people than myself. 

My step-dad died of throat cancer, my mum's survived breast cancer and HATES the fact I smoke. I have a new girlfriend who doesn't smoke and is super supportive of me quitting. But on a personal level, I don't care about the long term effects on ME. I care about my loved ones worrying, I care about stinking of smoke for my girlfriend, but i'm not so bothered about probably dying earlier in years to come. 

Currently house/dog-sitting with my girlfriend, using the whole change of scenery/routine to try and quit, as well as having GF around all the time because I don't know if I can trust myself alone. She's currently having a nap and all I can think about is sneaking out for a smoke. If she's up I have part of my mind creating schemes for me to try and escape to smoke (Take the dogs for a walk, swing by the shop etc). I know rationally that this is only cheating myself, but I can't stop thinking about it. 

At work i've seen real heart breaking struggles, and it's making me really angry with myself that i'm getting this messed up by smoking compared to some of the shit i've seen other people get through. Like I SHOULD have perspective that this is nothing in the grand scheme of things... mind over matter I guess.

My grandmother died this morning. She was 96, lived a great life and didn't want to hang around being miserable any longer. All I want to do is go for a walk, sit somewhere quiet and smoke and cry for a while but I don't know if this is my brain trying to trick me into 'allowing' myself a fag because i'm upset. 

I don't really know the point of this post, other than keeping my mind busy for a bit. This is so much harder than I anticipated. Massive respect to people who're further along than I am.

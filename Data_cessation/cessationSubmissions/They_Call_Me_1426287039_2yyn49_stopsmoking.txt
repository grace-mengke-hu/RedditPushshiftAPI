I'm 29 I've been smoking since I was 12... TODAY I QUIT

Enough, I'm tired of being a slave. I'm tired of my cardio being so weak.. I'm tired of always needing to make sure I have a cigarette available..

Its disgusting

Tomorrow will be my first day in over 15 years I will not have a cigarette.

I cant believe its been so long..

Its time..

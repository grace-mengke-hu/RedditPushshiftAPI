Additive free cigs my saving grace

Ive been trying to quit since New years but still averaged about 4 or 5 a day. I got sick of this and in a desperate kind of last ditch effort I decided to buy a pack of American Spirit cigarettes (had to go on a bit of a hunt to find them in Aus) and I'll tell you what I got through 15 of those, gave the rest to my mum to get rid of and havent thought about smoking since.
 this was 2 weeks today ago now and I feel great, I found the smokes have just enough to take the edge off rather then give you a full on kick of the nicotine. the cravings I had were few and far between and a fraction as hard to deal with as before. Just thought I'd give a heads up to anyone who's looking to quit as I had no success with any of the more traditional methods and I almost can't believe how simple I had it.

Constipation after quitting cigarettes - Still vaping

Hello fellow redditors-

I used to be a very frequent cigarette smoker / e-vaper. Yes I was a heavy cigarette smoker AND vaper. Yes I know I'm an idiot. So I have officially cut out cigarettes 6 days ago but I still vape pretty heavily. I'm trying to cut things step by step and cut out my bad habits one at a time. I have "quit" cigarettes before in the past and the problem I ALWAYS run into is constipation. I know this is a common thing among people but I always thought it was the nicotine that helped with the bowel movements so it really confuses me why I run into this issue when I'm still getting a lot of nicotine through my vape... 

The constipation is probably the thing I hate the most about quitting cigarettes. I did chug some prune juice a few days ago and yes it worked but its not a satisfying natural poop. It's basically like taking a laxative and I'm trying to avoid having to drink prune juice every day. Help please!

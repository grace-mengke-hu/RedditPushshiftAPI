It starts with you and only you.

Long post alert. Bear with me.
I had been smoking since the last 3 years. Recently I got to a point when I couldn't function properly without smoking a cigarette. I couldn't sit with my book open for one hour without a smoke. Every meal seemed to be incomplete without a smoke.
I really wanted to quit smoking. I tried it a year before but the run went for dot 7 days.
I really needed to quit this time. Yeah, and then I joined reddit. On the first day, I scrolled through almost all the posts and suddenly I felt an urge to quit,the urge I never felt before. So first of all, here's a shout-out to you guys.
I had a plan. I would stop smoking when I had little stress and responsibilities in my mind.End of university exams seemed to be the perfect time. I heard that if you continue to not smoke for 21days, it almost becomes a habit and you eventually end up smoking.
First few days were very rough. I cannot explain the magnitude of craving, especially when all of your friends smoke. I started smoking green tea when I couldn't help. Honestly, the taste and effect is nowhere close to smoking a cigarette, but it does make you feel better.
By the end of the 14th day, I had decided I can cheat only when I am drinking.I was really excited for the weekend. I was waiting to "crack a cold one" with the added bonus of smoking while drinking.
However, I felt nothing great (miserable would be too much) when I took the first puffâ€¦much to my surprise. It was not a necessity anymore.

Today's the 21st day. Still going strong and confident that I won't smoke another cigeratte. I feel satisfied.

It starts with you and only you. Friends will try to mock you, take you down, offer you a smoke. The only one responsible for your betterment is ONLY YOU and obviously you reddit guys :D.
Hope this post helps you to quit one day, just like r/stopsmoking chipped in for me.

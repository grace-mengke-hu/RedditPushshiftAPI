Damage from year of smoking?

Hey all so I ended up smoking for a year for some strange reason. (I'm 36.)

I also have depression, anxiety and health anxiety so I'm freaking out about how much damage I may have done to my lungs,

Because my breathing feels slightly off, or a bit harder to breath in. 

Wondering if this is just anxiety because I'm so worried about it, or I need to get some sort of tests done. 

I did get a lung x-ray six weeks ago which they said was clear...

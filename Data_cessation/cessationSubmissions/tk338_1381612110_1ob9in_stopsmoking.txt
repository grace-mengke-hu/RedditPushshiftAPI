I could be so much better at everything.

I've been an on and off smoker for 3 years, all the time I've been running and going to the gym, I apply myself, push myself and I can do it. The only place I don't push is my smoking (and drinking).

I was browsing another subreddit today and saw some insane videos of really fit people pushing themselves to the max, having a blast, loving it and it hit me, I still have time to be those people. If I spent the extra time and money on becoming fit and healthy in every way I could be so much better.

To add to it all I'm not addicted. I mean people laugh when I tell them, but I can go 3 or 4 days without a cigarette and then on a whim I'll buy another pack, and another and another and then accidentally quit for a few more weeks.

The problem for me is the lifestyle the associated 'bad ass' image around it all - and then you look at the cancer patients... Not so. The physical addiction too, I have my 'areas' where I go and smoke, times of day (especially at college) where I sneak off and have a few, thats when it will be hard.

So this is it. I will be a better person, I will push myself that little extra mile not to buy those packs, if I don't have them I can't smoke them, and I now just have to hope to God that I haven't given myself the dreaded c-word.

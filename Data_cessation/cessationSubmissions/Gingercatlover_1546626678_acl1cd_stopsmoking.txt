Day 1 For Me

Today is my first day on this journey. I’m 24, started smoking socially about 6 years ago, with the last 3 years being regular smoking. My wife and I want to buy our first home this year, so that’s my motivation. She also needs to quit, so I’m hoping if she sees that I am succeeding she might decide to too. So glad there is a sub here that I can check up on where others are further along on their journey, definitely is helping already to see the successes of others :)

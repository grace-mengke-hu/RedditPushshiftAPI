Chewing on my hands.

Hey guys, I thought I'd share this with you because it is a weird and unexpected side effect of smoking cessation for me. I've been without cigarettes for a month and a week (crowd goes wild). I'm really happy about it since I never thought I could be without cigarettes. 

Anyway, its been relatively easy going for me except for one thing: I've been chewing on my hangnails. You know, the little slivers of skin that sometimes pop up next to your fingernails. I've been chewing on them periodically very badly. I didn't notice it until I was typing at work and two of my fingers were in pain! actually a lot of pain! 


So, I'm sure that this will stop soon especially since I've noticed it but what the hell? quitting smoking is weird man! Anyone else have a similiar experience? I've been covering my fingertips with bandaids throughout the day to stop myself.

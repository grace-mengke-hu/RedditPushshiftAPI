I slipped

I quit in November, but this past weekend was really rough. I managed to make it to Tuesday, but life fucking came for me so I broke and I bought a pack and I smoked two reds.

&amp;#x200B;

THING IS, when I smoked the second one, I felt gross afterwards, so I took that pack, and I put in on the fucking curb in front of my apartment building for the homeless folks to take it. I know I should have thrown it away, but I couldn't get myself to do that. You know what? I think I'm ok with it.

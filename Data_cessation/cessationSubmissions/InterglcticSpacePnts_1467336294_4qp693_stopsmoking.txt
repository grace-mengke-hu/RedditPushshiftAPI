Day 11?!

Day 11! I know it doesn't seem like a lot, but I've never made it this far in my previous quit attempts. I really do feel ready this time. I went out with all the smokers yesterday and honestly didn't have the desire to smoke. At all. It smelled bad, actually. That blows my mind. Reddit has been an awesome support system. I read everyday and seeing how far others have made is truly inspiring. I'M A NON SMOKER! WHAT?!?!

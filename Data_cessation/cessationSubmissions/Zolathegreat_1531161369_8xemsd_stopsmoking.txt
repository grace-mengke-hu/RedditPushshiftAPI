Quitting again without restarting the timer

I'm smoke free for about 2+ months. I believe that I need to repeat the whole process of initial quit practice. That doesn't mean I will relapse or that I relapsed. It just means that I want to remember how I quit and to reasure myself. Ex-smoker usually start to smoke again after some time. That is the reason for this repeat. To be sure that I will never smoke again. This is my first day of the new quit. Anyway, be strong and good luck!

I stopped because I felt bored.

Title is most of it. I’m almost 30 and I picked up my first one at 13.  I just didn’t go get another pack on the way home. Haven’t had any cravings or other issues. The girlfriend isn’t on the quit train, but one day, perhaps.

I just woke up that day and felt annoyed at going outside to smoke, and finished up the pack by that afternoon and that was it.

I wonder if it helps that I have anosmia (no sense of smell) that things from the increased sensitivity would change that would push back towards relapse.

Either way, I’m a week in and I don’t really feel any different, I just wanted to say hi, and start a little progress post for myself.

Good luck and stay strong to all of you.

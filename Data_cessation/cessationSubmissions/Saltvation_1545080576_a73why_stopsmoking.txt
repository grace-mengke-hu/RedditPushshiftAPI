Can't quit, I tried everything

Hi, I've been a heavy smoker for 8 years. At first it only 2 or 3 puffs per month when I was a student, then it jump up significantly after I got my first job and now I'm with 2 or 3 packs a day.

Originally,  I'm not your typical friendly and relax guy. I'm a very short-tempered person, a creature with habit and got frustrated (or tilted) very easily. I'm not very determined and do everything in my life with a little-bit-more-than-half-assed attitude. Smoking helps me become relax and friendly towards other people, even people I despise. Can say it help me more than a little bit with my career (I'm a veterinarian)

Now, lets talk about my quitting. I have failed more than 10 times during past 3 years. I tried supplement therapy (nicotine patches, chewing gum and candies, vaping), reducing my smoke, quitting cold turkey. None of it actually worked and I found out in my case, quitting is pretty easily but remaining as a non-smoker is incredible hard. My longest time is 3 months and then I got hit with a big stress (my family member passed away) and I give myself 1 smoke, that first smoke after 3 month is amazing and delicious that it's basically clear all my sadness away.

My girlfriend is extremely frustrated, we are going to marry next summer and I don't want to her and our kids to live with a heavy smoker. This time I decide to give it another try. Please give me some tips, I appreciate any help from other ex-smoker that sucessfully quitting this habit. Thanks a lot.

P/s: The time I lost my job and stay jobless/broke for 4 months, hell it feels 10 times better than quit smoking 1 week.

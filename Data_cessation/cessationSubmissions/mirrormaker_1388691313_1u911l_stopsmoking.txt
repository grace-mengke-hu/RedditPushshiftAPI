Almost two weeks in, but about to face the real challenge

I stopped smoking just about two weeks ago, right before I traveled to my parents house for the holidays. I decided that I wanted to start the process well before New Years and well before my final semester at college began.

I never have a problem not smoking when I'm at my parents' place mainly because I was never a smoker when I lived at home. For me, my habit was always tied to my surroundings at school. I am incredibly nervous about smoking once I go back to campus on Sunday. I am more committed to quitting than I ever have been, but I know that my real cravings are going to start on Sunday and that what I have experienced over the past twelve days is going to pale in comparison.

Need your support, Reddit. Send me positive vibes. I taught myself how to juggle over the holidays just to give me something else to do once the cravings come, but I know that staying away from cigarettes at parties is going to be a real challenge for me.

EDIT: United decided it would be funny to fuck their customers and then never return their customer service phone calls, so I'm stranded in fucking New Jersey for another few days. Came very close to caving today, but came through. Yesterday I spent an hour on a plane that didn't take off, then five hours on a customer service line to be told vigorously to fuck myself, then had an hour long cab ride with a driver who kept on complaining that my house was too far away from the airport. If I can get through all of that smoke free then I can certainly handle college smoke free.

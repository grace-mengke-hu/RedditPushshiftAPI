From 48mg Nicotine from lozenges/day to 0. About 36 hours in, and I literally want to murder someone. Help?

Title.  39M.  Used lozenges to quit smoking about 8 years ago.  Off and on hooked on them ever since.  Consumed at least 48mg a day for the last 4 years.  Quit cold turkey; last one was before midnight going into this Sunday.  

I’m now about 30 hours in, and like the title says, I want to kill someone.  Anyone.  Preferably with my bare hands.  I’m not sad, depressed, or suicidal.

I am so angry and amped up (without nicotine somehow), that i’m Fantasizing about being this violent to someone else.  Anyone.  

I fucking hate that I have to go this **again**.  I fucking hate that my wife who is pushing me to do this can sit there and keep drinking every night while being over 200 lbs because she’s an undisciplined fatass can just keep sitting there while I struggle with yet another Herculean self improvement feat.  (I quit smoking and then over the past 2 years I lost over 70 lbs of fat and put on serious muscle and actually look hot for the first time since college).  

I’m angry that no one gives a shit.  They don’t know what i’m Going through.  They don’t know that their pay on the back and “attaboy” is hollow, soulless, empty and designed only to hit their “nice deed” dopamine receptors.  They are all a bunch of ducking frauds and liars who enjoy seeing me suffer.  


And they win no matter what.  If I succeed in quitting they get what they fucking wanted.  If I fail, they get to keep laughing at me and beating me down, and laugh again when I have to pick up the yoke and try trudging down this fucking path again.  

So other than drugs or NRT, what can I do to make this stop?  I’d like to get some work done today, not drive my wife to divorce, and not snap a cashier’s neck.  Thanks (and thanks for letting me vent; that helped a little).

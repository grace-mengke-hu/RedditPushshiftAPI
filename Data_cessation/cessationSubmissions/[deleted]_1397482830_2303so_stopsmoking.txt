Day 1: Moving Forward

This post is for myself more than anyone else. I want to use it as a reference point on days that I really want to smoke another cigarette. I smoked what will hopefully be my last cigarette a minute ago. As of now, I have been smoking for about 6 years, and I am/was smoking anywhere between a half pack to one pack a day.

I have made two attempts to quit in the past. Both times were to appease my girlfriend who really does not like that I smoke. The first lasted 3 weeks, the second for 6 days. The difference between now and then is that I want to quit this time for myself. I am currently in a mental rut, rapidly approaching graduation. I feel lost in life and mentally losing control over my future. I do not like this feeling. I look at all the things that I *could* be doing and rather than acting on those thoughts, I instead have been choosing to forgo actual action for simple depressing thoughts. In an effort to move my life forward, I want to start with at least one thing I do have control over: my smoking. Each day I do not smoke will serve as a reminder that at least in this one aspect I am progressing as a person. I am tacking on at least one victory every single day. I do not expect this to be easy. I do not expect it to be fun. This will make my daily victories hold greater importance for myself.

Of course, there are other reasons. The cost. The smell. The stigma. Whatever. I don't really care about all those things, seeing as how I've smoked all these years. I don't know if I will succeed. I don't know what is *really* in store for me. All I know is that the last time I tried quitting, it sucked, I had a headache 24/7, and I became a really nasty person. I will try to vent and bitch on this forum, and if I get a response, so be it. This is a personal journey, but I should always be looking for help from others. I sure as hell needed it last time.

TL;DR: Quitting smoking to (hopefully) move forward.

Suggestions for coughing at night?

I haven't smoked in 4 days, but I have developed the worst cough of my life. From the second I lie down, I just start hacking.  I cough until I throw up and then cough some more. I've tried cough drops, hot tea, and using a ton of pillows so I'm semi-sitting.  Do you have any suggestions? I just need to sleep!

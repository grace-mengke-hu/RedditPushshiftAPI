My Mantra: I am one cig away from one pack a day

Whenever I feel an urge to smoke, I repeat this over and over, sometimes out loud, sometimes in my head. 

"I am one cig away from one pack a day". It always keeps me on my toes, and reminds me that there is no such thing as just one. Thought I'd share for all the new quitters like me, stay strong. Not even one puff!

Advice needed

Hello. I am a very sad and depressed person. I feel like being a smoker is a big reason for this. I also feel like smoking is such a big part of my life that it is my identity. I want to quit so I can feel better, but I am soooo addicted to smoking. I have read Allan Carr. I have tried the smoke free app. I just can’t get my head to cope with actually not smoking. I so badly want to be a non-smoker, but I so badly want to smoke almost all the time. I smoke almost every hour, sometimes more. I logically know that in the long-term, not smoking would greatly improve my depression, but emotionally I am so terrified of coping with my depression without the comfort of smoking. If anyone can relate, and has successfully quit, what advice do you have for someone so wrapped up in this attachment. I’ve smoked since I was 14, am now 29. I always told myself I’d quit before I’m 30, but that year has come and I am afraid I won’t actually quit. I have almost no willpower. I have serious rage when I can’t deal with my problems by avoiding them with a cigarette. What do I do? :(

Day one yet again.

I've had many day ones. Sometimes I last a month or two, sometimes a week. My GF of 4 years just broke up with me, she went back to her mothers leaving me in our house alone. I was pretty quick to turn to the smokes. 

But I'm sick of it. I'm sick of smoking, I'm sick of always quitting, I'm sick of coughing. I could use some support now more than ever guys and gals. This habit is not only killing my body but my mind.

Edit: I just picked up Allan Carr's easy way to quit smoking on Google Play and have started reading it. Wish me luck and thanks everyone.

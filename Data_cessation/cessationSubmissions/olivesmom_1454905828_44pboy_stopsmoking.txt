First 24 hours without a cigarette after 10 years of smoking.

I started smoking at age 14, am now 24, and I have put a lot of thought and planning into quitting (cut down massively, started changing daily habits to throw my body off). 
There were times today that I felt fine, even better than fine. And there were times that it felt like the veins in my neck were exploding and I would burst into tears for no apparent reason. 
Overall, the hardest and most rewarding day of my life. I feel like I can do anything!

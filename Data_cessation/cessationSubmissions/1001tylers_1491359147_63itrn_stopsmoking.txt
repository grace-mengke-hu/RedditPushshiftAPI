I'm going crazy?

Hey I quit not very long ago. I keep reaching into my pockets and when my smokes and lighter aren't there I suddenly feel this sense of dread. It's almost like wanting to call your best friend and realising they just died (sounds dramatic but that's how intense the feeling is). I also am getting all kinds of pain and my digestive system feels like I swallowed a bunch of forks and knives that are slowly trailing through my intestines scraping everything on the way through. I also keep feeling very confused about what's going on and what I'm doing. It's like I keep forgetting what I'm doing right in the middle of doing it and can't snap out of it.

Does anyone have any advice on what to do with the digestive pain, the strange deep feelings of dread and the severe mental confusion I keep getting?

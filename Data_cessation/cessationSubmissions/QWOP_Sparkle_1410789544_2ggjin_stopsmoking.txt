So...how long does it really take for the tar and stuff to clear from the lungs? When do they become 'normal' again?

The NHS site says 20 years. Different apps say different things, different sites say different things.

I'm guessing its down to how much you smoked per day. 

I'm only asking because it seems like any other physical benefit from quitting seems to pick up again quite quicky i.e blood circulation, skin condition, senses etc. but nothing much is really said on the lungs other than 'the risk of lung cancer is still high' =/

Would be nice to hear some positive benefits when it comes to the lungs, considering thats where most of the damage is

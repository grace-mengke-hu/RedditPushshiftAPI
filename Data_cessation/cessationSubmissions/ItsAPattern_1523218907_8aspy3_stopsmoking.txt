Almost a week!

Feeling real good about this one! Despite your views on using NRT (I went cold turkey for almost 5 years last time), I'm vaping this time around and fine with it. I actually enjoy the taste? I know it's not as pure as cold turkey, but I'm focusing on the positive here, urges are down thanks to easy way (who says not to use NRT, ha), and I've tested myself very minimally, out drinking with mostly non smokers. And not a single puff!

I do think the vape is much better, I finally am comfortable saying empirically. Even if it is just placebo, I feel like I smell and taste better. And I for sure am not coughing and wheezing as much as a week ago on a pack a day. 

Just sharing progress, hope you quitters are making it through the weekend ok!

self-improvement app

I'm developing a self-improvement app that is focusing on getting rid of bad habits and setting up good ones. The main idea is to set up a good habit with 21 days long challenges. All of the challenges are focusing on self-improvement. Also there is a possibility to set up a competition by challenging your friends. I'm looking for beta-testers.

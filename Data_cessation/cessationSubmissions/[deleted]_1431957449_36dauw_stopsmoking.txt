It finally feels normal to not smoke

It's taken 7+ weeks, but it finally now feels totally normal to not smoke. I had a rough time around 4 weeks in, but shortly after that it just clicked and I stopped wanting to smoke.

Having spoken to a few friends, they seemed to struggle around that point too. If you are around there, and it feels shit and you want to smoke, don't. You are possibly days away from that moment where it all makes sense.

Thank you to everyone on here for giving me so much stuff to read and realise I'm doing the right thing, and good luck to everyone who is going through this or starting soon.

Here is to the future, and I'm hoping that I don't ever have to reset my counter.

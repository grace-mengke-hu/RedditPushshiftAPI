Tough week.

I’m 20 days in. I’m about 10 hours away from my 3 week milestone. This wk, today in particular, has by far been the most difficult for me. I have no desire to actually smoke, I refuse, but this wk has thrown me the worst cravings and the worse anxiety. Today was ridiculous. 

My first 2 wks I was exercising and smiling and cleaning/organizing and having a blast not smoking, even enjoying the experience itself bec this time the withdrawals and cravings mean more to me, knowing now that it’s my body’s way of healing and getting through this addiction. But my God the cravings today, although I conquered them mentally by saying no, not ever again will I smoke...absolutely NOT going to...it’s like my body started rebelling against me and for the first time in a VERY long time, sent me into what I’m guessing was a panic attack? I got control over it pretty quickly, still having to be careful, but for the rest of the day I’ve just felt completely wiped out. Almost like a hangover. 

What’s up with that? Is that normal? I know nothing is really “normal” with our bodies after addiction until we get some months under our belts, and I’m not expecting an over night miracle, but that took me off guard today. Crazy that my brain brought up something residual about nicotine and smoking today and turned it into a true physical withdrawal experience, although I am 100% nicotine free. That’s just insanity.

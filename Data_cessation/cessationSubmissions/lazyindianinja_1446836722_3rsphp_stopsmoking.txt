First 24 Hours!

Woah! This is the first time that I have gone 24 hours without smoking. And it has been brilliant. I feel so free and happy. I can sense the craving but I seriously have no desire to smoke again. And I am happy about it. 

I was only able to do this because of this sub, the amazing and helpful people in it and the 2 things I read, Easyway & Freedom from Nicotine.

I know I might be celebrating as if I have completed a year but believe me I have been trying to quit for a long time and going a day consciously without 1 is just awesome for me.

Obviously getting the drug out of the body is my number one priority (juice & chocolates help!) & being aware of the chances of relapse (because even though today was easier than I thought, tomorrow could be much worse). Never take another puff!

I'll be sleeping a happy man today. Tomorrow a new challenge begins and I'll be back here for the inspiration & motivation!

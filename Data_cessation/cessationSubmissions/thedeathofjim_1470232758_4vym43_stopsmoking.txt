Problems with replacing nicotine with exercising

When I quit in early June I was a half pack a day smoker. The cravings were killing me in the first week so I started swimming and working out to reduce the agony. It worked like a fucking miracle. I’m healthier than ever right now, going to the gym five times a week, cooking good meals by myself and most importantly, nicotine free.

These are all great news, but whenever I’m on my rest days my cravings come back like a storm. I would finish my dinner after work and stay fidgety, anxious and annoyed for the rest of the night. I just realized that that is also my state of mind before going to the gym every night. I think in some ways I have replaced smoking with exercising. Is anyone else experiencing similar problems?

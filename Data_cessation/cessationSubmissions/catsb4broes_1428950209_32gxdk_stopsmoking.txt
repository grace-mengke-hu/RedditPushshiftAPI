79 days in and I've just gone fully nicotine-free, withdrawal symptoms are tough but worth it :)

I've quit a few times before, and always ended up giving in due to allowing myself to smoke the odd cigarette, telling myself it was fine. Well it wasn't! 

This time round I got straight on the nicotine mints which satisfied the craving and also replaced the mentality of nicotine satisfaction=smoke with nicotine=fresh/minty, which really helped. Smelling cigarettes became disgusting, watching my friends smoke no longer made me jealous but made me feel a bit ill.

I was on the nicotine mints for the first 77 days, and I've just decided to come off those too because I've got to the point that I no longer want cigarettes at all and so don't feel in danger of going back. So I'm only just experiencing nicotine-withdrawal symptoms now, and it's tough. Weak, anxious, body is on edge. But instead of wishing I had a cigarette, I wish I had a mint. I'm going to push through this! Hope all of you who are trying can too!

I was on here three years ago and failed after 6 months, trying again for real.

It was frustrating coming back here because I forgot that I had set up a badge when I quit in 2011, saw my flair read 965-ish days, which is how long it would've been if I didn't start back up six months later. I fail a lot because not many people know I smoke, so when I try to quit and fail only I know, and I can rationalize any decision for myself that doesn't affect other people. I'm all about doing this for myself but I obviously need some outside support, so I'm going to try not to let reddit down.

That first slice of pizza...

Well I am a New Year's resolutioneer, so I had my last smoke around 2 am on January 1. The next day I woke up with a bad head cold that lasted for the next week. This was fortuitous timing, as it made smoking seem unappealing, and gave me an excuse not to go out drinking or do other things that trigger cravings. 

Finally on Monday night, my cold was gone and I started feeling better. My roommate came home from the pizza shop he works at with a special pie he made for us to eat for dinner. Suddenly it occurred to me that I hadn't been able to taste food for a week due to the cold, and now I was having my first real post-smoker meal. It would not be an exaggeration to say I nearly cried with joy after the first bite. The food tasted so amazing! I've been pigging out all week now that my senses of taste and smell have returned for the first time in years. I had thought about a lot of the benefits of quitting smoking but forgotten this one. 

TL:DR Food tastes goddamn amazing now.

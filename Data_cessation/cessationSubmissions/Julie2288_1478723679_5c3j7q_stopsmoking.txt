5 days without smoking

I can't believe that I really made it through the first days withou a cigarette...  I hate when my mind is trying to tell me over and over again that I need a cigarette to feel better and that I felt better when I was still smoking... I've been smoking half of my life 1 pack a day... is it getting easier and does the craving get easier or just vanish completely? It's so hard to be strong and say no over and over again... 
just felt like talking about it... unfortunately I'm the only one in my personal surrounding who's quitting

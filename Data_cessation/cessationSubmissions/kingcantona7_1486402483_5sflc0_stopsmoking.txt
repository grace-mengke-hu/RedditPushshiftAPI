Underestimated this monster..

Smoked for 20+ years. Quit a couple of times during that time. Once for as long as two years. This time, I've been smoke-free for 7 days. For the first 6, I was fighting hard to recover from a pretty severe bout of Asthma and had no desire to have a cigarette. Infact I was shocked at how easy it all was. Woke up on Day 7 feeling *much* better but guess what came along with that?Cravings. Mighty, heart throbbing cravings. By night, I felt the full force of it. Pulled through but I am not underestimating this opponent again.

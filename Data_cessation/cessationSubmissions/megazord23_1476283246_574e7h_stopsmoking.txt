I have never ACTUALLY tried to quit before

I'm about to actually try to quit smoking for the first time starting today. I have said I will quit, told family members I'm "cutting back" but never actually gave any effort at all. As soon as I get in my car or get to work I automatically start smoking. I need help and I'm not going to tell anybody this time. I'm just going to do it and see if anyone notices.

I have a half a pack of cigarettes in my car, I am about to go to lunch I need to willpower myself to not pull one out and smoke it.

Any advice for me? I don't know if cold turkey is going to work but that's what I'm going to do. If i try to cut back it won't matter I will just keep smoking.

Today makes 2 weeks

I'm 22, been a smoker for 5 years, last cig I had was 14 days ago. No more desire to smoke, and I have been getting that "high on life" sort of thing I've heard about, BUT, I am having a lot of fucking trouble controlling my anger. I've never had anger issues, but lately whenever I get mad or agitated at something, I get fucking hostile and filled with rage. 15 minutes ago i finished screaming my lungs out into my pillow over something rather petty that otherwise would have only just annoyed me a bit. I'm ashamed of this. Can anyone relate? If so, how the fuck do I cope with this rage?

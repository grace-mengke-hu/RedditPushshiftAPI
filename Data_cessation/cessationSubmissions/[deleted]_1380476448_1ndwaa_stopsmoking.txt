What have you found to be the best methods to successfully stop smoking?

This is both an academic and personal question. I am a mild smoker, about 2 packs per week, a few a day. I've quit before, cold turkey, it lasted six months and all I did was tell myself not to smoke. But now I am back at it. For a college class I have to write a report on a bad habit or something I want to change in order to achieve a more healthy life style. I decided to chose quitting smoking.  

I have to give at least three detailed methods on how to quite smoking, I know of a few, but I wanted to ask you guys, the people who are actually going about this feat. What are some of the way you decided to stop smoking? What are the choices out there?

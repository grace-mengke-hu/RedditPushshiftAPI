Today's the Day

I just finished my (hopefully) last cigarette. I am nervous, scared, and anxious. I'm in my junior year of college and right now the thought of writing essays (BA in Secondary  Education emphasizing English) without cigarettes or hookah seems like an almost impossible task. 

I don't know what kind of support or prayer or whatever this sub offers, but I am hungry for any support I can get. Thanks for reading.

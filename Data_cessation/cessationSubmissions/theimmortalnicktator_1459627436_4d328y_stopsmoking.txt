I threw my last pack away about 36 hours ago.

I'm 25 and started about 16. The withdrawals are pretty bad. I'm super edgy and have been exercising/eating compulsively. Anyway, I'm supposed to go to a get together to watch the ncaa tournament tonight and I'm nervous about it. I know there will be some smokers. It's not as much that I'm worried I'll smoke, I'm worried I won't be able to enjoy myself.

Just smoked my last cigarette!

Posted here a while back asking for advice. I have read Alan Carr's book twice now, and after a weekend of excess smoking and having trouble breathing through my mucus clogged throat, I am finally ready to quit. Just requested my first badge on this subreddit. I will be keeping regular updates, and be checking this subreddit daily for inspiration. Wish me luck!

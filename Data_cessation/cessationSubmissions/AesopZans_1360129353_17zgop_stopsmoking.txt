What are some good methods to avoid smoking besides eating sunflower seeds?

I've learned to avoid my desire to smoke by keeping my mouth occupied with sunflower seeds but there are some places in which I can't eat them. I don't know how long this method will last me but I am noticing that my cravings are dying down as the days go by. Staying positive!

Goodbye friend

I read some posts that say cigarettes are my friend,  well consider this.
Cigarettes are the kind of friend that would borrow money but never pay it back.
Cigarettes are the kind of friend that would borrow your tools but never return them.
Cigarettes are the kind of friend that leave you standing out in the rain.
Cigarettes are the kind of friend the call you ever hour at work and stress you out so you can't concentrate properly and they may even wake you up at night and disturb your sleep.
Cigarettes are the kind of friend who are just so damn needy that you have to give them so much of your time.
Cigarettes are kind of friend that don't care if you live or die.

Well with friends like this you don't need enemies.

Its time to ghost this friend, there are much better friendships to be found.

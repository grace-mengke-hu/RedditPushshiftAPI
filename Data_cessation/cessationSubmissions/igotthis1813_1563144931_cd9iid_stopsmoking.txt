Keep fighting the good fight! 👊

13 days 11 hrs! After 30+ yrs smoking, it feels so good to say that! Not sure what clicked this time, yet glad it did as I feel more determined than ever to make this one work.  The Smoking Free app and this forum have been the best support ever!! The last 2 days were a little rough with feeling snippy, yet I powered through with reading this great forum &amp; all you champions that have kicked it &amp; give such great support to others fighting the good fight! 👊  Two things I recite over &amp; over that have helped too: “Not another puff, no matter what” &amp; “Failure is not an option”!! 😁  I know it will get easier and there will be times that it will creep into my mind; yet I do know it will go away just as fast as it came! It will so be worth the reward of knowing I was able to overcome &amp; beat this terrible addiction!  I got this ... one day at a time! 💪  Keep fighting the good fight!!

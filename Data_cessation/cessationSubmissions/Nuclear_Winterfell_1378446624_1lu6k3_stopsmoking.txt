What do I need to know about using nicotine patches? Mostly in terms of side effects and any withdrawal symptoms I may still experience.

This will be round 2 of trying to quit. Last time I made it ten days cold turkey before I caved. This time I'm going to try patches, and like last time, toothpicks for something to occupy my mouth and hand (and gnaw angrily on one when stress triggers me to want a smoke).

As far as the patches, I've read all the warning labels, I know about switching spots to avoid rashes, not fucking with the dosage, wearing one patch too long, or slipping up and smoking while I wear one, and the possible crazy dreams if I wear it while I sleep. Anything else I should know?

Relapsed slightly and craving really bad. Just want that one cigarette.

Hi,
I'm 18, started smoking around 16. I read Allen Carr's book about a month and a half ago and that pretty much made me quit. So I did, cold turkey. I thought I'd never smoke another cigarette in my life but two days ago I randomly started craving so hard and without really thinking I took two hits of a friend's cigarette. I gave it right back but now all I really want to do is fucking smoke. 

I remember all the stuff from Allen Carr's book but right now it all feels so irrelevant. I live in NYC so I feel like almost everyone smokes and I can't help but want to get into the addiction again. And when I think about all the adult smokers around me they seem to be doing just fine. I know it does nothing for me but the craving is just so strong and I miss going outside for a smoke break and smoking with friends and smoking while doing homework and just having that cigarette in my hand. Right now I want to just go out and get a pack and deal with quitting later. My brain is saying, "everyone relapses, it's normal to struggle with quitting. Most people don't succeed the first time, why should you? Just quit again later." 

I just want that one cigarette. But I don't know if I'll be sucked back in and I know it's not worth it but I just want it now.  

FUCK ME! what can i do???

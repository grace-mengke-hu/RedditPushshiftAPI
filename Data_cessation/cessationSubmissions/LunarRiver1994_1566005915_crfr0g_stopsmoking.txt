Question about something that happened....

Odd thing I did not expect with even more shocking results. After 1 year and 6 months cigarette free I smoked a cigarette 2 nights ago while on vacation in Cancun. Yes, it was a relapse but in the best way possible.

It was an absolutely vile feeling and as I type this, it caused my sinuses to become inflamed and my throat to be sore. Even though it was a lapse of judgment it really has solidified my resolve to never smoke again. I guess I am of the lucky sort that it really was “just one more”. If any of you are considering “just one more” know it’s legit not worth it and it is disgusting and vile and will trash your body. I can finally say with absolute resolve that I will never smoke again. Not to mention the risk of becoming addicted again. So yeah, save yourself the guilty conscience and pain and skip the smoke lol.

TL:DR. Smoked after being clean for over a year. Destroyed my respiratory system. Did not become addicted all over again (thankfully) and can confidently say I will never touch them ever again....ever 🤢

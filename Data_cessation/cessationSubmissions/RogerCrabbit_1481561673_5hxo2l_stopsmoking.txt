Anybody used laser therapy to help with quitting?

Hello,

First time here so please be gentle. I'm really at my wit's end with my addiction and need to get a hold of it. I'm planning to stop as part of my New Year's resolution but rather than going completely cold turkey I wanted to try a few different things out like classes etc. I have seen posters around my area for laser therapy treatment and wanted to know if anyone else has tried this or if it is just whacko nonsense. Thanks

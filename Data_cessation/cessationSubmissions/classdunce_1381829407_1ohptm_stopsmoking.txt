Need help containing urge

Seven year smoker here, currently at two packs a day.

I have tried stopping in the past with no success. However, I am now faced with a difficult scenario. For various reasons I need to not smoke for a day without having any adverse reactions. I need to be able to concentrate for about 6 hours without any cigarette.

What can I do to suppress the withdrawal symptoms for this timespan? I was thinking patches, but I haven't tried them before so I'm not sure how well they work.

Thank you!

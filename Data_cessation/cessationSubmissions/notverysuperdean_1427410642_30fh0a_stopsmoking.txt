Decided to quit as of today, help me not lose my nerve.

Been smoking regularly for 2 years now (not a lot compared to many people but I'm only 18). I kept telling myself that I'll stop at the end of the next pack, and then the next - you get the idea. Well, this morning I hadn't done my normal "how long 'till I need to go grab another pack" math and saw one last solitary smoke. Figured it was time, smoked it, and decided that this is it. Not exactly looking for any advice, I think I just need someone to know that I'm committed so that I'll be less likely to go back to it. 
It's definitely going to be hard as I'm a week before my uni's final exam season and I'll need all the motivation I can get.
Thanks in advance to anyone who reads this, and good luck to everyone in their not-smoking endeavors.

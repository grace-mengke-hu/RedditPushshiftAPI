Sore throat

Hello dear strangers.

First off, I would like to thank all of you for being an inspiration and a rock in rough times. This sub has pulled me through several times over the last 2 weeks.

This is my first and last time quitting since I started smoking at the age of 14, nearly 10 years ago. At the end of it, I was easily smoking a pack a day, usually even more. The first few days were pretty rough but it soon got easier. About a week in, my throat started to become sore when swallowing but it would get better througout the day. Today, I woke up and it did not go away and I have been hurting all day. 

Is this normal? Will it fade? Im starting to get worried. Advise would be welcome. Stay strong on your journey!

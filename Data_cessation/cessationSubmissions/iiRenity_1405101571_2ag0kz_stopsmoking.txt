How to support a quitter?

Hi~! I hope this is an okay place to post this! My boyfriend has recently made the decision to completely quit smoking, cold turkey. My entire family, with the exception of my father and I, is full of smokers so I'm aware of nicotine fits. I suggested maybe he try to use e-cigarettes or slowly cutting down to help him better, but he's determined to quit cold turkey after having smoked a pack to a pack and a half a day for several years.

How can I help this be an easier transition for him? I want to be supportive and try to relieve as much as the stress as possible for him. We also smoke pot, though I'm the heaviest user (smoking daily). I've told him that while he is quitting I will absolutely not smoke, because I didn't want to tempt him with the sensation of smoking and accidentally cause him to relapse.

I just want to make this as painless as a process as possible for him and let him know that I'm here to support him along the way. I'm planning on picking up a majority of the cleaning and cooking for a while so that won't stress him as much.

Basically: What can I do to help him through this? What should I *not* do?

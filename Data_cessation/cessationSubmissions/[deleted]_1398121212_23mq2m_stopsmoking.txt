Smoked for 7 years, gone 21 days without a cigarette. Coughing a lot. Is this normal?

About a week after I quit smoking, I've been having a bad cough. I have no other symptoms of any sickness or anything. The coughing seems to be worse in the late afternoon or evening, or around bed time. 

Anyone else have this experience? 

Oh and I have no cravings anymore, no other physical symptoms. And I feel much better, other than the coughing.

Also I smoked about 5 "pack years".

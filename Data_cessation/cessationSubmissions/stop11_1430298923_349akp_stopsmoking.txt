I smoke tobacco out of a bong. Anyone else done this an quit?

I call them 'moles' although I've heard other names for it. Fill the bowl up with tobacco an sprinkle a little weed on top. I've been trying to stop for years. I find that just getting rid of my MB (mole bong) to be one of the hardest things for me to do. 
It being there gives me comfort knowing if I'm ever stressed out I can take a hit an get instantly relieved. Getting rid of it stresses me out and makes me just want to take that next rip even more.
I don't smoke cigs and ecigs just aren't even close to what I get from moles, but the amount of tobacco per mole can't be good for me. 
I need to stop.
Anyone with tips that have gone through a similar situation would not be unappreciated.

I can’t f*ckn hang!

Dangling off the wagon! Hanging off it, scooping up clouds of chemical ash.
I bought a pack of smokes, smoked half a cig rolled in a spliff.
Feel like shit obviously, heart racing short breath self contemptuous comparison to the scraggly fucker outside 7-11 that I almost, almost distanced my connection to.

Fuckin a, I understand that it’s a life-majority drug relationship absolutely defining my psycho+physiology, but it’s also constant, constant stresses of home, work, larger-than-me global existence.
It feels like I’m choosing between short term, life-wrecking misery(sounds dramatic but we’re just barely keeping it together anyway) and long term, guaranteed general misery, which doesn’t seem avoidable in my life, or even my childrens’ anyhow, whether or not I smoke! 150 plant&amp;animal species going extinct each day these days - I don’t think I’m going to see the recovery from where we’re going, and I’m not at all confident many other humans are either.

Holy shit I am sorry for posting this. 
What a dramatic bummer, this is a damn fine group of supportive people here and I think I am desperately calling to yall strangers for help, for whatever you do in the most given up of moments, this feels existential beyond this insidious drug scam we’re all involved with, but also is the drug scamming at me, shit.
I am *not* in a relaxing life, environment, or job either, for the record, this shit is tight, not in a good way, in the best of times.

I gotta learn to meditate, that seems like the only place left.

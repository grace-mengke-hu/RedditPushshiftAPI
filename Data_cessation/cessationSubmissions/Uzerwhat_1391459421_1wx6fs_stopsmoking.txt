Not a heavy smoker, but a smoker nonetheless.

Nothing like a birthday helps remind you how long you've been smoking for. I turned 22 this year and its crazy to think I picked up my first cigarette about 6 years ago.

I'm down to about a 2-3 cigs a week now and I just don't know how to deal with not being able to quit those last 2-3 cigs. It always happens in the most stressfull situations of the week, like this morning I got into a huge fight with the girlfriend.

give me advice if you have any! other than that I just really needed to vent somewhere, I feel really guilty even about the few cigs i smoke :( never ends up feeling good.

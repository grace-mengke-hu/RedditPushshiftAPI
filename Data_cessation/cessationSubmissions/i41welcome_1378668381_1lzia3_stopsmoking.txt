Change your life! 90 day challenge

I believe I have the freedom, power, and conscious insight, to define my own life. I choose how I dress, eat, and handle my daily affairs.

Now, I've chosen not to smoke cigarettes anymore.

By knowing that I have that self-determination, evidenced by my successful dressing, eating, and living habits, it gives me GREAT Strength -- and a freedom I never thought possible!

I was always hesitant to use nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) since it seemed contradictory, to keep the active drug of addiction, just administered differently. 

But I decided enough was enough, bought a nice e-cig, and have made a conscious choice not to purchase, bum, own, or smoke real cigarettes, relying on the e-cig as a tool.

And guess what? It works for me. But I realize it's a tool, and I'll be cutting back on it /giving it up as well (it's much easier than real cigarettes, from my past attempts quitting).

So I'm changing my life. I set a 90 day challenge (since the day it finishes on is a special anniversary). I've been almost a week with no cigarettes at this point, and no desire to smoke them.

As a matter of fact, watching my buddy juggle one while trying to play guitar made me smile, since that's what I used to do, too. 

I'm also exploring holistic health, such as meditation, exercise, nutrition. I love myself and owe it to myself to treat myself well!

I encourage you and admonish you, whether you're 16 or 60, to find that strength and self-determination, to give up smoking for good.

This is YOUR life. What are you doing with it?

Made it to day 2 barely

I almost gave into my craving yesterday.  So i took my bike off to buy some cigarette and some idiot came and crashed into me from the wrong side. By gods grace barely got away with my broken leg.  Too glad i didn't die.  I came back to my senses im thinking why i wanted to smoke.  I think i figured it out all my triggers. 

My triggers : 
* Excitement 
* After a heavy meal ( when i am stuffed tooo much )
* Boredom ( really its like a timepass to smoke )
* First thing in the morning ( I had made a habit of taking a smoke to help me take a dump )
* Stress ( I wont say it didnt help but i am stressed out all the time )

Just adding stress boredom and excitement marks my whole day.  I could feel the pain yesterday but i could also feel the urge for a cigarette it was almost like i was thirsty  for it.   Didnt buy any just gave up.  Guess i had to learn the hard way man really an eye opener.

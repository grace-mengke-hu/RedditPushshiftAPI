[Rant] One month in and a big ball of hate

As I hit the one month mark and still on the patch, the desire to smoke has returned and is now suddenly overwhelming this last week. I work with a moron boss (whose incompetence and general stupidity I have to fix several times a day) who makes my stress and anger levels skyrocket. I've tried running, crying, trying to work this out with a higher boss, drinking, music, eating shitty food, everything I can think of to relieve this stress and anger but nothing seems to help. 

I should be done working with this boss in a few weeks and all I can think about is if I smoke until we part ways I can handle our remaining time together, then I can quit again. I cannot comprehend handling these last few weeks on my own. I hate how I feel right now, angry, impatient, etc. but don't see any other way to get out of this funk. This sucks and I don't know how to get through it. Kind of losing my mind here. Help?

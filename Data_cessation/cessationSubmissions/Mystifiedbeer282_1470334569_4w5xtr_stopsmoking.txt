Tried quitting for 3 days...

Ive been smoking for about 9 years now, was smoking about 1- 1 1/2 packs a day. 

For the past 3 days ive been trying to quit cold turkey. It seems the first 6 hours is a piece of cake then after about 8-10 hours i just collapse. 

I have no interest in nicotene patches, gum e- cigs or anything to replace it.

Just wondering if anyone has any tips or tricks?
Il be trying to quit again in the morning, i just keep telling myself i gotta keep trying!

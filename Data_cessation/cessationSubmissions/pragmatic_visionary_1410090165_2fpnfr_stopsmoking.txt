After ten years of 1-2 packs a day, today is the day.

Not day 1. Today is day 365!

I've tried quitting several times before and was always unsuccessful due to the smallest stressful event leading me back to cigarettes. And then one day, it just wasn't hard anymore. And the decision to quit this time felt completely different. It's like I really knew that "this was it" and there wasn't a part of me saying "psshhh, yeah right".

How did I do it? A little bit of gum and a great gf who started to noticed but didn't say anything and just let me do my thing. My now  fiance knows that I'm the kind of person who doesn't really go for recognition too much do she stepped back and avoided cheering me on. I know that's probably a little different but I appreciated it. I didn't want to talk about how *well I was going. Just wanted it done. 

The second hand smoke never bothered me either. I would still hang out with people by the smoke pit during breaks and such. The one post I didn't want to let go was being outside. Cigarettes were an excuse to get away abd be outside for a moment. Now, I sometimes go sit by myself on the patio for 5-10 minutes alone. 

This grip was a little helpful, too. There was one user here (I'm sorry if his username slips my mind) who was very helpful and supportive. Kept referring to some English guy who wrote a book though. Reading something like that would have been counterproductive.

Anyways, I know I'm babbling over here and all but I just wanted you guys know that another one did it. One year?

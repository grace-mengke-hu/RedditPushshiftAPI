Real Stop

Hey there, I’ve been on here for a while but I’ve never posted, always just read for motivation. I’ve tried to stop smoking many times before and always picked one more up again a few days later, it’s an endless cycle that I’m ready to end. I’m serious this time. Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated. I just smoked the last one in my only pack about 45 minutes ago. I have many reasons to quit listed on my notes portion of my phone and I’ve downloaded the smoke free app(again). I smoke roughly 7-8 cigarettes per day and when I’m at work i only smoke during lunch,  the rest is all at home I’ve tried Chantix, patches, gum and lozenges in the past. The longest I’ve gone without any nicotine in the past is 3 months. I’ve skimmed though Alan Carr’s easy way to quit in the past and I plan to ACTUALLY read it now. Anyways that’s a little bit of my story and I hope this community can help me achieve my goal.

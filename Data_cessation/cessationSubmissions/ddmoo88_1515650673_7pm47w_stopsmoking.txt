229 days, need a reminder why I quit

Been doing so well. Once I got past a month, it was mostly smooth sailing.

But I'm having a rough night, dealing with some bad news, and all I can think about is a cigarette. Remind me why I don't want one!? I will be grateful for the help.

ETA: Made it to the next morning and didn't smoke! Thanks to everyone for the reality check and encouragement.

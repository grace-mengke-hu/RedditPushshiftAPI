Concentration – day 8

Hi all: I am a longtime lurker, first time poster (a colleague of mine is quite active here so she gave me a heads up). I quit 8 days ago. So far, it's not been very fun. It started when I read Allen Carr, and boy did he really motivate me! I feel very confident in my decision to quit smoking, but DAMN, I'm really feeling it (coughing, dizzy, etc).

Worst (and this where I hope you kind folks can help me) is my concentration a work. It is pretty much ZERO. I am either thinking about having a fag, or am stressed out about wanting to have a fag. It's hard to describe, but it's more a physical feeling. Anyways, I work in a creative field (designer) and am pretty good and fast – the latter is what I'm known for. For the last 8 days – nada. Everything I do looks bad, and I can't really complete a thought. DOES THIS PASS? AND WHEN? I honestly fear for the future of my career. Last thing I want to do is start smoking again.

My own 'best way' to quit.

Everyone needs to figure out the best way for them to quit, and it may take a few attempts, so don't be disheartened if you don't quite make using a particular way.  But this is my experience of what I think is my most successful experience and method.  And it happened partly by accident.

This has been my 4th or 5th 'serious' attempt at quitting over the past few years and after 35 days, it is the best and most optimistic I have felt about staying quit.

I started with the patches again, but this time after about a week I started having a mild reaction to them.  Nothing major, just a feeling that the hit of nicotine was too much.  I started feeling agitated and on edge all the time so I took the decision to try cold turkey.  To try to get that physical dependence over and done with in a few days.
It was tough, it was really tough.  I surpressed the feelings through willpower, eating loads and drinking gallons of water.  But after 3 or 4 days, it all subsided and became so much easier.

I think wearing a patch for a week to start to get out of the habit of going for a cigarette, and then cold turkey to beat the ohysical addiction was a real winning routine for me.

I feel great, I feel fitter and healthier, and despite the occasional urge or craving after a good meal or a beer, it is the most confident I have ever been of remaining a 'non-smoker'.

Everyone needs to find their own best way to quit, but if someone else is successful using this as a guide then that would be amazing.

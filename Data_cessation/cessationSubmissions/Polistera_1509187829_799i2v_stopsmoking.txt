Tonight is two week anniversary

Two weeks ago on the stroke of midnight I smoked my last cigarette. My actual plan was to quit a day later, but a moment of clarity came to me. Most of my problems in my life stem from putting things off indefinitely. My debt, my job loss, my failing relationships, my non-existent career stem from my 'will think about it tomorrow' mindset. By saying 'I quit right at this moment' I felt like i was taking a step towards ending my addiction to avoidance, not just of smoking. 
It's been a confronting two weeks with moments of anxiety and fogginess and I wonder if I had a job that maybe in some ways it would have been easier (having to focus on other things), but it feels fantastic to have flushed away the cigarettes and almost automatic tendency to reach for a few beers at the supermarket.

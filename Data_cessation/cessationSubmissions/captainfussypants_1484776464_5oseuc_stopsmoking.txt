Close call but I made it through...

Just got informed of a serious repair needed to my house and I was panicked and on the brink of picking up a pack of smokes..I walked out of my office and to my car and sat there and cried a bit, then pulled myself together and moved on to solve my problem instead of lighting up a cigarette. It feels really good to know I can resist it! Also 5 minutes later I got some hope from my friendly handyman that we can work it all out.

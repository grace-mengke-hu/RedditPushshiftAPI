Made it to 85days, Now my grans in hospital and my gf admits to cheating

I've not posted on here before, but i found the subreddit when I started quitting and browsed it quite a bit before/initially quitting. Recently I haven't browsed because I hadn't felt tempted to smoke but it did help me in those first hard weeks!

Now the main cause of me quitting was my gf. We had a big argument and she admitted worries about it. I quit while making her my driving force to do so. It worked and I've been clean to 85 days and feeling so happy. Now my Gran who has been on and off Ill for the last few years has fallen severely ill, speaking only a few dozen words in all of last week; to me visiting her from London on Saturday! I'm struggling with that and now my gf has admitted that she cheated last Tuesday with a boy. She was kissing him for at least 2 hours in a bed and admitted to being topless in bed for ~30 minutes... she announced she wanted a break this Friday when i visited her when really i should have been visiting my gran. Only announcing yesterday that she had cheated on me and also kissed 2 guys the night before telling me... Now I'm struggling to cope with seeing my gran in such a terrific state and feel privileged her last words may have been to me (she still hasn't spoken yet). And at the same time, I have to decide whether i want to carry on with my gf or not. 
I smoked 4 cigarettes out of a 10 pack and gave the pack away, but last night i went out and i smoked again while drinking. I'm going out again tonight and fear i'll do the same.

Has anyone been through a similar dilemma? I need some motivation because i'm craving cigarettes all over again... 

TL;DR GF (main cause of quitting motivation) cheated 3 times, gran also very ill.

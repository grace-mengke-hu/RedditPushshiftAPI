Welp, 1000 days since I smoked my last cigarette.

Just wanted to drop by and give some encouragement to anyone out there who is struggling to quit. It wasn't easy but it is the best thing I have ever done in my entire life.

Stick with it and you can do it! Personally, every time I had a strong craving in those first few weeks, I would just remind myself "you won't feel like this forever"

I've saved $6,250.00 on cigarettes at this point, and I've saved myself 150,000 minutes of standing around smoking outside. This comes out to 2500 hours, and 107 DAYS of pure smoking.

With the help of Zyban, I finally quit smoking after 15 years @ a pack/day.

I finally decided to quit smoking. I went to the Nicotine Dependence Clinic at CAMH in Toronto. After going through their program, (A 3 hour information session, a private one on one interview & finally a visit with a doctor) I was prescribed Zyban. After taking it for 10 days I was told to try and see how long I could go without a smoke. I immediately went from 20 cigarettes a day to 3 cigarettes a day. One week later I went to 2 smokes a day, a week later 1 cigarette a day. Finally I stopped altogether. I had almost no physical withdrawal, and I couldn't be happier. 

I just wanted to share my experience so that it may help some of you decide to quit.

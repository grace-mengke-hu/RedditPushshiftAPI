One month cold turkey, twenty years, ~3/4 pack a day

I am so happy to have been nicotine free for one month!  I smoked for 20 years, with about a year break for each of a couple of pregnancies, and other numerous quit attempts.  Last time I quit, I vaped for about 6 months and gradually reduced my nicotine level.  But I still wanted to vape all the time, even 0 nicotine, and I knew I needed to stop.  I was still addicted, psychologically.  And I still missed smoking.

So I quit cold turkey on Memorial Day.  I am determined to stay quit.  I still have cravings sometimes, but it's less of really wanting to smoke, and more of wishing to alter the way I feel (which I know smoking wouldn't do anyway).  Feelings of stress, escapism, discontent, regret, etc are all things I am learning to feel without a cigarette.  I know it's better this way.  It's not easy.  

Yay to one month of freedom!  I'm going to have some cake for breakfast to celebrate. (don't look at me that way, I earned it!)

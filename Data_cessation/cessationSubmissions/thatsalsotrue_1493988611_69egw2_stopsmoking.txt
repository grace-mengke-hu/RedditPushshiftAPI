Thank You

I don't think I've ever actually posted here, but this sub helped me quit smoking and be ok about it.

I smoked from 16-29. I finally quit November 18, 2016. I've held one in my hand while drunk, feeling my mind trying to convince me to do it. But I didn't. And I won't. I know now that no matter what, getting back on the nicotine train will never be worth it. 

Not smoking 15-20 cigarettes for 167 days (or 2,512 cigarettes) has saved me $750. It has also allowed me to go from living paycheck to paycheck to actually saving money and paying down debt, instead of just talking and dreaming about it. 

I spent my 30th Birthday going through a miscarriage at home, and didn't smoke. (Wouldn't that be the perfect excuse for "just one"?) I have made it through holidays, gone out drinking, been in a car with a smoker, felt intense anger, and haven't smoked. 

I read Allan Carr's book a few years back, and felt such shame when I started again (and smoked for three more years). The last page says, "if you smoke after reading this, you will smoke the rest of your life," and I was determined to prove him wrong. It took more years of starting and stopping and guilt and shame. But it IS possible. 

You have to stop making excuses and allowing the denial. It's not impossible, it's not the end of the world, the discomfort goes away faster than you expect.

Thank you to this sub and it's posters for sharing their experience. Being able to see people on the same day as me, experiencing the same withrdrawal symptoms and emotional issues, gave me comfort. And showed me that what I was going through wasn't anything special or different, it was just nicotine trying to keep me locked in. 


Good luck to everyone trying to quit! It's a lot nicer on this side. You can do it!

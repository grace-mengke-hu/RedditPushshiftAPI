Quitting. Again. For my son. (Day 0)

I have a baby boy on the way. He will be here in 3 and a half weeks. I would like nothing more than to be cigarette free when he gets here. Little man is gonna need his dad around too. This is gonna be like my 3rd or 4th REAL attempt and I just have to keep telling myself that a rolled up piece of paper isn’t stronger than I am 💪🤙 

My last cigarette was at 3pm on 3/27/2019.

Stopped being a lurker for three years to ask for help

I've been smoking for 3 years now. I'm a 21 year old male I want to quit so bad but it's like I can't. It's just habit as we would call it. The longest I've went cold turkey is probably 5 hours. I wanna stop before 3 years turns into 30 and I'm laying in a hospital bed ravaged by cancer. I just read on here all the great stories and I figured y'all might have some advice or tips. Thank you for reading.

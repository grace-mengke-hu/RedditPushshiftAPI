Sleeping excessively 1 week post quitting...

...is this normal? I've stopped smoking and it's been a full week. I haven't had withdrawal symptoms per se, but I've noticed I've been sleeping excessively. Taking lots of naps, going to bed earlier and it's SO HARD to wake up in the morning and get out of bed and keep moving. Thoughts?

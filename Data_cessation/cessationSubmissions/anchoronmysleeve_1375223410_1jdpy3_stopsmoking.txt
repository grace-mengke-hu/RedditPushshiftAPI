Quitting on August 1st!

Hey all,

I'm 27 and have been smoking for 16 years, and I'm really nervous about quitting smoking;  I can't really remember NOT smoking.  What do I do when I'm stressed?  What do I do when I'm bored?  What do I do when all of my friends who smoke go out and have those awesome fun smoking circle chats?

I'm going the laser therapy route, I've heard many good things about it and it worked for my parents.  Due to crohn's and random allergies, the patch, pills, etc don't work for me.  Should I try the vaporizers?  Or try to stop the hand to mouth stuff altogether?

I've always heard that the first three days are the worst, is this true?  I don't even know if I should stay subscribed for awhile, I'm scared seeing the words "stop smoking" will translate to "smoking.. smoke.. damn I want a smoke."
Any recommendations/tips/tricks are appreciated!! Wish me luck!!

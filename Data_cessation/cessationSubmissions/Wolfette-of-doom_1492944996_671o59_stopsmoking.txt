23/04/2017 at 12:00 - set date and hour

Hey everyone! I posted a while ago about stopping to smoke, whether I should reduce first or go cold turkey. I tried reducing and started smoking the same as before.

So today, I downloaded the Smoke Free app and went ahead and purchased the pro version, because spending some money on not smoking would be a great incentive for me, plus it costs about the same as the pack of ciggies I WON'T be buying today, or tomorrow, or the day after...

So, I'm going strong and set the date for today at 12:00

It will make me save about about 1365€ per year, which will be a nice amount to spend on my wedding dress and accessories next year. 

I've got two main motivations: I want to set my life straight in the health department before I get married so that I'm in a better state of health and mind to be a wife and mother, plus it hurts the environment so much, and it would be hypocritical of me to go vegan or go zero waste but keep on throwing out 17 cigarette butts per day + releasing all those shitty chemicals in the air.

So, yep, here I go!!

I'm not telling my fiancé of my attempt this time, nor will I tell anyone else. I'm counting on myself and support groups and the apps to make it through this.

So yep. Let's get this done :D

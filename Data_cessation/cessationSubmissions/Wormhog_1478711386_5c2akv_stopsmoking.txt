Don't use the election as an excuse!

Folks, I have a disturbing number of friends on Facebook seemingly relapsing on cigarettes, booze, and other drugs over the U.S. elections. I just wanted to say to all those quitting smoking past and present, please don't cave in. It's not worth it. If I'm online, I'll talk to you if you're anxious. Stay strong! Prove that you can get through stress without cigs. Use it as a test to find other ways of managing the stress without demon nicotine.

11 days and I feel like crap

It's been 11 days since my last cigarette. I smoked for the past 9 years pack a day. My chest feels funny, I keep coughing up nasty crap. Haven't slept more than 5 hours a night since then. I keep getting intense feelings of nausea - though I haven't actually thrown up yet. I have a pretty constant headache and heartburn from hell.

I've been on Wellbutrin for the past 3.5 weeks and since I've quit smoking 100% for over a week (11 days) I have cut my dosage in half getting ready to stop taking the Wellbutrin. My wife still smokes and when she does I still have an intense urge to pick one up and light it. Anyone have similar issues? Anyone taken Wellbutrin before to quit? When did you stop taking the pill completely? Are the urges stronger after stopping Wellbutrin?

Thanks

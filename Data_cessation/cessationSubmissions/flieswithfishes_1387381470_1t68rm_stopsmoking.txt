Will there be SO many benefits?

Warning: long, i.m.o. necessary, intro to my question.

So I've quit 7 days ago, don't have the badge but I'm using an app for it. 

The thing is; this app tells me that after this week I've only gained 8% of the improved circulation I'm going to get if I keep at it. As for smoking induced shortness of breath and sinus congestions it says I'm at 2% of the maximum gained benefit.

However, I already feel like I'm  physically in a world of difference. I've gone from running 2 kilometres and gasping for air, tired for the rest of the day, to running 4.5 at a faster pace without really feeling like it was hard to do in 9 days. Also having the feeling I could do it again just an hour after I run.

Am I to understand this difference is attributed only to CO levels normalising, and nicotin disappearing from my blood, in combination with the 4 times I ran a couple of kilometres in the last 9 days? Or do I simply regenerate faster than this app believes the avarage quitter to do? Or is something else going on?

Either way I'll keep myself from smoking, just hoping to hear from people how long it took before they felt, personally, they were back to normal physically. Preferably someone around my age with around my length of smoking. But all comments are welcomed.

To give you an idea of my lifestyle(not everything may be relevant):

I'm 21, I have smoked a pack a day for 6 and a half year, from when I was 15 years old. To add to that I have smoked weed almost every day for the past 5 years up until recently(cut down to once or twice a week). I've been doing mostly weight lifting in the gym from age 17 onwards pretty regularly, but basically no cardio for the last years. I did use to cycle 130 km a week, from when I was 12 until shortly after I became 18 to get to school. Also did about 2-3 hours of various sports a week from 6-16 years old.

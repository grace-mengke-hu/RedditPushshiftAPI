On day 5...need some encouraging words from people who have mastered the beast.

So I am currently going through day five, woke up tired of feeling like shit and quit cold turkey, and I have to say I've done pretty well but the cravings are hitting me rather hard and not dissipating like they have the past few days. Any advice on how to get through these and not revert back to the death stick or Copenhagen haha?

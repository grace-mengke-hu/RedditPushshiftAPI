Quit for ~3 months - now cigarettes make me emotional?

Just curious if anyone else has experienced this when quitting.  I've cut down too quit over the past year and I'm not at the point where I get a craving once a week or so.  I don't always give in and smoke, but I've noticed that when I do I get overtly emotional the next day. Crying and depressive thoughts.  Nothing serious but real melancholia. Anyone else experienced this?

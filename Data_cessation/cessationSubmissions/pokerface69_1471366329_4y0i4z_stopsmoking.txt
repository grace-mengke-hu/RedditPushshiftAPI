Health effects after 4ish years of smoking?

I had been smoking 4-5 a day for little more than 3.5 years, I had quit for 4 months last year. After that it was always 2 weeks off then start again :( but Now I finally quit for real and this time I know I'm gonna make it. no other option. 

I wanted to know how my health have been effected so far? I never spit any black thing whenever I quit so that's a good thing I hope?

Almost gave into that relapse, but here I am.

So hi again, I was here about 40 days ago when I thought I just couldn't take it anymore, was pretty much feeling down but thanks to the kind quitters here I was able to make it through. 
Anyway, today I was feeling terrible all day, stress and anxiety had me dying on the inside, so I decided I will go and buy myself a pack, a pack won't hurt. 
So I took a walk down the street and it was past midnight, and every time I reached somewhere where I could get pack, I felt even more anxious, so I kept walking and started talking to myself, I felt much better and it was then that I realized that I needed no cigarettes actually, it was depression that was kind of hooked on it. 
So basically late midnight strolls do help. Also get to know yourself better, it's kind of relieving to listen to yourself more. 
Trust me, it gets better.
Keep going, fighters!

New here...

Hey all, my name is Bart and I'm 20 years old. After 5 years of smoking. I decided that today I wanted to quit. I haven't touched a sigarette in 6 hours now. But I'm still feeling the urge...

The current symtoms I'm having are; Slightly stressed, mentally not 100 focused, physical need to hold a sigarette.

You guys got any quick tips on how to survive the first couple of days...

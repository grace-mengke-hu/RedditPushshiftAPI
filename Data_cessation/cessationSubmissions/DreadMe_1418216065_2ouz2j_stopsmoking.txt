20 years old and I quit today

I have only been a smoker for 6 months so I am confident I can end this habit with little withdraws. Thank you to the people on here who have smoked for years and quit thank you for showing me that it can be done - I owe you one and atleast 15 years of my life.

Wish me luck!

150 days. Finally.

I have made it 150 days. I feel sooooooo much better. I woke up this morning and exercised, and thought about how much easier it is now. I did yoga after that to cool down and took deep breaths. Wow. No wheezing. No coughing in the morning. No sitting out in the cold every couple hours to get my fix. 

I smoked for 11 years. I figured it would just kill me eventually. I have done this so far. I can do this from now on. So can you. Cheers to your smoke free life!

35 years later, 5th day

Hello all,
Only try in 35 years. Started smoking at 15ish, now at 50, well...I guess I'm just tired of the inconvenience, the stigma.
I have no health issues...no relationship issues that brought me to decide to stop. Just becoming less enjoyable, I suppose, so why continue.
I have heard how it is the toughest thing to rid oneself of and that is understandable. I have known several people who have tried and failed multiple times. 
By comparison, I am doing well. Cravings are at a minimum and I am confident that I have the willpower to see this effort through.

Thanks for the read.

Stay on Reddit -- this is the longest, strongest quit I've had in years.

The last time I had a quit this strong was in 2014. I was not very proactive with my quit then. One day i had a grouchy morning and I justified buying a pack. I didn't give quitting a second thought -- just kept on smoking for two years. During this quit I had a slip, and instead of going back to smoking, I manned up, reset the clock, and kept moving with the momentum I'd accumulated. Here I am at 23 days (would've been 54 if I didn't slip). I feel great for the most part, although I still have sour moments here and there. Not a day passes where I don't think about cigarettes, but I'm really getting used to this lifestyle.

The hardest part is, well, quitting. Once you decide to quit, the second hardest part is -- staying committed. That's why I make at least one post a day. Thanks for reading/thanks for posting. You guys keep me smoke free

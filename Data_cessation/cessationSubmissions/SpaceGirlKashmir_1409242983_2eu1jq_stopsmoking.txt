Day 4- Symptoms galore

This is my third time quitting. But technically the first time that I didn't cheat by having just one every other day or sneaking off to a bar because I knew that I could bum a couple cigarettes without having to buy a pack. It's also the first time I have had support while quitting and have not felt the "I NEED TO GO TO THE STORE RIGHT NOW BEFORE I THROW ALL THE THINGS IN THE HOUSE ACROSS THE ROOM" feeling. Just overwhelming want to smoke but no desire to break down and buy them. Which I feel is a step... or at least that's what I'm telling myself. 
I'm feeling exhausted, my throat hurts and I keep coughing. Which I read are good signs of getting off the pack. (damn you marlboro) 
I have been exercising and drinking a ton of water and reading a lot to keep myself preoccupied. Figured I would post every few days for accountability since I didn't want to tell my friends or family I was quitting and let them and myself down again if I failed.

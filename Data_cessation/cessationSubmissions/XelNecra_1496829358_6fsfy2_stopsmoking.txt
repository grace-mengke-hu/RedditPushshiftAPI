Will this work?

Hello there,

I started smoking about 4 years ago, as an adult, for a stupid reason, and now i am stuck with it. I started casually, and recently found that I had to buy a new pack of cigs almost every single day. This became a huge financial burden.

I tried to go cold turkey, but it did not work. I planned to quit entirely on tuesday. It worked fine at first, but after a few hours, my every single thought got occupied by smoking. Which is not good for my work - I need to be focussed on what I am doing. In hindsight, i realized that I had an important meeting with my boss that day, and I can't remember a thing from it because my mind was screaming for nicotine louder than anything.

I analyzed my cravings, and how they behave. It looks like I can get through the day with "only" 4 cigarettes (which is much much better than a pack).

Now I am wondering, when I can set up a routine of 4 cigarettes a day, and actually stick to that (no slips and stuff) for some time, will it become easier for me to entirely quit?

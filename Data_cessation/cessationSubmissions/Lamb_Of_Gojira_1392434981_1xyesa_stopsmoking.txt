Anybody find their appetite is insatiable after quitting?

Smoked for a few years, not a heavy smoker by any stretch but definitely addicted. I quit about a week ago and I'm feeling great about it. I just find that the last few days my appetite has been off the scale. I am ALWAYS hungry.

EDIT: IGNORE THE BADGE, it's from a previous failed attempt.....

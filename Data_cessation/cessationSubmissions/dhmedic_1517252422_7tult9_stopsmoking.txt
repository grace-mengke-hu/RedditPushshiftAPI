Just starting... or stopping

Ok, gonna lean on you guys for some help. I've tried quitting many times before. sometimes its a few weeks, sometimes a few months, but I somehow always start back.

Got into a medical school. I'm afraid if i don't get out of the habit before starting, I will smoke throughout the four years of school. So lets get this started!

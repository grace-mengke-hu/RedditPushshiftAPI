Almost a month, here's a little story and my thank you to everyone

So, hey, cool story here. I started playing The Wolf Among Us, in the game you control Bigby Wolf, a character that is many things, being one those a smoker. Right in the beggining you're thrown in a room where there's a cigarrete vending machine and you're given the option to interact with. I looked straight up to my character and said "you too don't need that, mate" and decided to not let my character buy another pack of Huff & Puff.

Well, okay, later on you see him smoking another one, but who am I to just push my ideals into other people too, right?

Let me thank you all guys for the support, in the first days I'd come here looking for a reason to not light another one, now I come here because it makes me feel good, everyone that is in this sub has decided to make an improvement in their lives, to the ones struggling I say that it's worth it, it'll stop looking like a sacrifice in no time, just hold on a little more and you'll see for yourself.

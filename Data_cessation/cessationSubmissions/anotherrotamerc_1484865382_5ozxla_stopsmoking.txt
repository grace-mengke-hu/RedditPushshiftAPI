Only 18 days!

That's all! Only 18 days and I feel so much better mentally and physically I can hardly explain. There is no reason to smoke cigarettes and the only people who seem to know this are the ones who don't smoke. Everyone else feels it is a physical or emotional need.

This sub is full of new quitters, experienced quitters, successful quitters, short-timers and hopefuls.  

You are never done being a non-smoker, just like people who have never smoked are not all waiting for the time when they can start. 

As a once and former smoker, I must always remember that I don't even want to smoke. Just because I smoked at one time, the fucking things still have no purpose whatsoever, in any circumstances, if it is difficult to avoid occasionally, that's the price of freedom for someone dumb enough to have begun.

I do not want to go back. I want to breathe. I want to live.

Started in college for fun, now I think I’m actually addicted

Hello everyone so I began smoking and using the Juul(pod a day) on a daily basis my freshman year I hated it at first and began to slowly become fond of nicotine.  Now I’m in my second semester of sophomore year and I literally can not go a day without it... I think it is because the Juul allows me to take multiple hits in my dorm before sleeping, when waking up, driving. Etc.  I’m getting a little worried because I’m begging to feel actually addicted now, not the “I’m sooo addicted” everyone is always saying jokingly at college but true true addiction.  Any advice on how to stop?  I can’t bring myself to throw away a Juul I’ve spent a lot of money on but I think that might be the only way.
Thanks

I relapsed; I hate it; I never want to smoke another cigarette; can you help me get my head in the right place?

I relapsed a few days ago. I'm not sure what exactly triggered it. I think probably a set back I was having around my mental health difficulties (it was to help my mental health that I quit in the first place); but I've now been smoking a handful a day for the last few days. It's not at the level it was when I was a smoker, but it's still a full relapse. 

I want to quit now before I become as fully hooked as I was, but each day I've thought: That's it, none tomorrow, and I've given in so quickly. I think it's the despair. I'm disappointed in myself, I've lost confidence in my ability to do this, I'm scared of how bad it'll be because my first week was horrendous. I already have panic disorder and during the first week of the quit the frequency of my panic attacks went through the roof. I was a complete mess. I don't think I can face it again.

But the cigarettes themselves make me anxious, they make me feel dirty, they make me feel bad about myself, they make me feel trapped. I just want to not do this anymore.

Please can anyone help me just get my head straight and feel brave and confident again? I want to stop doing this to myself right away.

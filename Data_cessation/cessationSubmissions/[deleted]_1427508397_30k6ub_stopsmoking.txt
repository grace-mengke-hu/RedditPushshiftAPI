3 Days and 12 hours in

I've been on reddit for quite a few years but this is my first post... in fact the first account I've made too. Reading though these submissions has helped me cope with my cessation so I figured I could make a post as well if it helps others. 

After 15 years of smoking a pack or more daily I finally made the plunge Tuesday morning (3/24/15) at approximately 8:30 AM. Since Tuesday morning I have not had a cigarette and according to my little tracker that is 70 cigarettes which is not something I've come close to in the past 15 years. Furthest I've gotten before this attempt was about 18 hours and that was probably 6 years ago.

I have been using NRT but very sparingly. Tuesday I used 3 pieces of gum, Wednesday I used two pieces of gum, Thursday and now Friday I haven't used any gum. Thursday I did use my vape for a couple puffs after sitting in traffic on the way home from work but so far today, Friday, nothing. Traffic is my biggest trigger to tell the truth, I think mainly because I would always smoke in my car and because other people's destinations are clearly more important than mine so their dick moves are warranted. /s

Some things that have happened over the last few days:
-Dreams are more vivid and odder than usual which I didn't think was possible.
-My normal calm self rages (internally) at the most mundane mistakes that I myself or someone else makes.  
-I currently feel incredibly hyper and spacey right now and there is no reason for it. I haven't had caffeine since my normal two cups of coffee this morning at work. I'm guessing, based on what I've read, that my brain is dumping neurotransmitters that nicotine normally blocks is finally reaching their targets... not sure. Sorry if none of that made sense. Took me almost 40 minutes to put this post together.

In any event, I enjoy reading everyone's stories. Keep strong!

Today is the 27th day.. :( I went out with my friends to a bar for the first time this month, they were all smoking. I stood my ground and didnâ€™t pick up a single cig, having trouble sleeping tonight, is it because I breathed some nicotine through second hand smoke? Worried that I have to start over

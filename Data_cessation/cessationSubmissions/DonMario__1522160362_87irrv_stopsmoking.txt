Smoking and cholesterol

After 3 months quit I did a blood test and the most striking thing was a 70% increase of the HDL cholesterol (so called "good cholesterol") comparing to my last year's results as a smoker. 

This is crazy. I new that smoking had a negative impact on the production of HDL (this is one of the negative impacts on the cardiovascular system) but to this extend?

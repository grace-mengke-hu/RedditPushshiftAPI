I've Quit Smoking For 120 Days. Here's The Outcome ...

So, it's been 120 days since I last quit. This sub reddit helped me a lot. I had a different account at the time but my hotmail was hacked and my Reddit deleted by a so called friend!

Anyway moving on. I used NRT for about 80 days, and have been off NRT for around a month.

Here's the **positive** things I've noticed:

* My airways feel clear. I can breath normal again!
* I recover from illness quicker. Got over a chest infection faster than my girlfriend who smokes
* I can walk up hills without getting out of breath
* My exercise recovery times are much quicker. Before it took me a couple hours to recover from exercise. Now it takes 30 minutes
* My resting heart rate has dropped to 77BPM. When I am in bed relaxing it drops to 60. I've even spotted it at 55
* I don't stink of cigarette smoke!

**Updated**: I actually missed out the biggest benefit when I submitted this post. I have suffered with anxiety for about 12 years. It's bad at times. Since quitting smoking I've only had a handful of panic attacks. When I smoked I had between 1 and 5 a day! The anxiety caused depression because of how it limited my life, my depression is now much better. It's not gone, but it's a hell of a lot better and 90% of the time I'm happy bunny. All from quitting smoking :D

There are some **negatives** in terms of adjusting during nicotine withdrawn. These negatives didn't really start to rear their head until I stopped the NRT. They're not really negatives per say, just part and parcel of the quitting process.

Some days I would run out of NRT. I was using nicorette quickmist spray. I got them free from my doctor. The days I ran out were hellish. I was a really horrible person to be around at times. I felt I could not control the anger and frustration from withdrawal but I battled through it.

The day I quit NRT was actually much easier than the days when I would run out. It took a couple of days for me to feel normal but after that it's fine. Much of it is in the head, but when you're going through these symptoms you rarely think rationally.

So, yeah, heres to the start of a new life smoke free!

Thank you to this sub reddit for all the help you gave me. Without you guys I probably would still be smoking now. The support, and reading other peoples posts, really helped me kick the nasty habbit,

Can someone weigh in on how the length of your smoking habit affect your ability to quit? Say, one month at a pack a day, vs one year at a pack a day, vs 10 years? Does anyone know on any studies on this?

I quit for 10 years and I've been relapsed for the last 2 months.  Curious how quitting again after a 2 month addiction compares to quitting a decade ago, after a multi-year addiction....

Day 6: I slept 11 hours last night.

FYI, I've switched over to this username from /u/potatoheadpdx.

I'm having a lot of trouble focusing. I skipped my Norwegian class last night because I somehow just can't remember any Norwegian at all. My French is coming back to me for no good reason though.

Afternoons and evenings seem to be my worst time for cravings. I don't think about smoking in the morning much anymore. :)

I'm stuck in this weird combination of super antsy, can't sit still, but if I lie down, I'll definitely fall asleep. So I slept a lot last night.

I really can't focus on anything right now. My point is that I'm on day 6 and I'm still doing okay. :)

The first week for the rest of my life.

Today marks the first week without smoking.
I'm coasting right along with moving forward on the rest of my addictions (gaming, porn, etc) but the hardest has been not smoking.
So here's not to just a week of no cigarettes or tobacco, but
a week to the rest of my life!

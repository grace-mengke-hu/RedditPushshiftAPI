Day Three Smoke Free

I’m fucking losing it at the moment. It’s been a slow build. I thought I was doing so well with managing my cravings but I just had a breakdown when I accidentally knocked over one of my favorite vintage wine glasses and broke it in the kitchen sink. Tears and all. Couldn’t control my breathing. I hate this. I hate this so much. Still haven’t smoked. But I am disturbed at how much this affects my emotions right now. Just wanted to share. Thank ya’ll for listening.

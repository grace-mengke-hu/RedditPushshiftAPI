Some advice re nicotine gum

Hello 
I’m on day 19 with the aid of nicotine gum, I’m chewing the 2 mg pieces between 6 and 8 a day. I have been a smoker for 30 years, about 10-15 cigs a day. 
I don’t want to increase my nicotine levels and plan to start reducing soon. My rage can be really strong at times, anyone have guidelines on the amount to chew?

5 days smoke free but relapsed.

I'm in my 30s. I smoked heavily up until I was 22, then cut it down to only while drinking for 13 years, but picked up the bad habit in smoking a pack a day for the past year or so. So I'm trying to stop now before any health conditions arise. 

I keep busy by working and hitting the gym. When I have cravings, I stop whatever it is I'm doing and do something else to switch it up and take my mind off of it; the studies are pretty accurate when they say cravings are lessened after about 15 minutes. If they're really bad (about 3-5x a day), I pop a 4mg Nicorette lozenge. The Equate brand sucks, and they're really chalky. Personally, in the grand scheme of things, choosing the more more expensive/more effective quit aid is worth it in cost (cheaper than cigarettes) and overall health.

I can't stress enough how hard it is to restore your focus in quitting after a relapse. I've been smoke free for 5 days, but relapsed last night, bought a pack and had a few. I threw out the rest of the pack. This isn't my first attempt at kicking the habit, but now that I have this newfound urge to do so, I will keep trying to stay away from it. 

Cheers to everyone that managed to successfully quit, and the rest of us that are still working hard to fight the constant urges. Your personal stories and words of encouragement go a long way. 

Stay strong!

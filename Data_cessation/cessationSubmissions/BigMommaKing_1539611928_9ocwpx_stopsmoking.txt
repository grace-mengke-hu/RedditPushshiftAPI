Cold turkey is my only way.

I’ve tried quitting about 30 different times in the past year and every time was unsuccessful. I’m trying to figure out how to retrain my brain. 

I’ve read Allan Carr’s easy way. I know I get nothing from smoking and instead it takes things from me that I cherish. 

I used to fear going through withdrawals and being mean, but now I’m dealing with them much better. I keep reminding myself how great it’ll be to be free. 

But the thing is I keep going back. I don’t know why. Sometimes it’s in a stressful time, but most the time it’s not. I just catch myself wanting to fill that void nicotine created and before I know it I’m smoking. 

I’ve only been smoking for about 3 years. But 3 years to many. I detest smoking. 

Any tips on ways to catch myself when I’m in my weak point during nicotine brain? 

Anyone have any experience with this? I’m assuming that after a few weeks of retraining my mind in those moments that feeling will diminish. Is it just nicotine withdrawal and once I get it out of my system for good I’ll be fine? Or is it my thinking?

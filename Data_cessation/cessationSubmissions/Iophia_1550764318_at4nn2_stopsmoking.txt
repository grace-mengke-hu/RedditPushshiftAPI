Lack of motivation

First 24 hours of quitting smoking and I've not moved out of bed. I just have no motivation to get up, that morning cig was always the first thing I did.

I'm not even having cravings I just have 0 motivation to do anything. 

 I've smoked around 10-15 a day sincr I was 13 (11 years) and my life routines revolve around cigs, take bins out? Cig, get in from a busy day? Kettle on and straight outside for a cig. Everything I've done for as long as I remember was always motivated by having a cig before or after and without that "reward" I can't be arsed doing anything.

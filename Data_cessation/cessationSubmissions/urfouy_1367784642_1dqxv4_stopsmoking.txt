Making poor choices because you are an addict

In the last two weeks, I've watched two people make seriously poor decisions based on their addiction to smoking.  Yesterday my best friend was telling me about how he needed an extra $200 a month to go to college.  Well, it turns out that he spends $200 a month smoking cigarettes!  During our chat, he seemed very hesitant that he would be able to quit something that is almost certainly going to kill him for something that will only improve the quality of his life in a huge way.  

I also watched a man come in and tell my doctor a very similar story.  He was pre-diabetic, but was bored of walking around suburbia and couldn't afford a gym membership.  He also felt bad, but he could never afford to let his kids go to the movies.  Turns out that he was smoking over a pack a day.  

"But you *know* I can't quit smoking," he said with a sheepish grin.  

We all know firsthand that quitting isn't easy, but *nothing* should rule your life like that.  You really can't put up with a few weeks of cravings in order to go to college?  It's absolutely ridiculous, and I remember exactly what it felt like to be there.  All you have to do is last for a few weeks of cravings and I promise you it will get better.  Just don't smoke another cigarette.  It's that easy.  

Your quality of life will improve a lot when you're free.  You will look better as the collagen in your skin recovers.  You will feel better as your lungs, mouth, and throat recover.  Furthermore, you will be able to interact with the world in a whole new way--by running, smelling, tasting, and not having to take smoke breaks when you're doing something important.  Suffer it out, because you know you won't regret it.

Good luck guys.

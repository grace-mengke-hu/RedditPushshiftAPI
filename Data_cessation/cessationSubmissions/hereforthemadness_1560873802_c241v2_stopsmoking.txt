I think im finally quitting.. now i feel physically sick.

So ive been lurking here for a few months. Ive wanted to quit for a long while but never had the will to do it. Not really sure what came over me over the weekend. 

So i went to bed friday night with 1 cig left. Woke up Saturday and smoked it with every intention to get more later. The evening came around and for whatever reason i hadnt gotten more. I told my hubs i had only had 1 all day and he was super proud. We went out to eat and had some drinks. I really wanted a cig so we stopped and bought a pack. I took 4 out of the pack for myself and gave the rest to a guy outside the gas station. I smoked 2 Saturday night and 2 on Sunday. Yesterday at work i bummed 3. Now im at work again and havent bummed anym at 3:00 ill have gone 24 hours without a cig. Normally i smoke about 15 a day, give or take a few. 

Since ive cut back, i have been twitching a lot and am more tired than i normally am and at the current moment i feel physically sick. Is this just part of quitting? I would think its withdrawals of the nicotine, but i am still vaping..

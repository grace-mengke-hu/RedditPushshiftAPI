Hey. Kind of a weird milestone for me.

I had to reset 2 days ago, after making it to day 10. 

But guess what? Today, I had 40 dollars to go get gas. I didn't sneak a pack. My hub would have never known.

I went to my BFF's house.. and they were smoking... and even though my hub would never know... I didn't smoke one.

Self. Control.

THAT'S WHAT WAS MISSING. This is like.. a new foundation. I do have a backbone. I do have will. 

(And trust me, my nigglies are baddddd today.)

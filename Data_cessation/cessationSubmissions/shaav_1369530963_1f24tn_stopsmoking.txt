My 7th day! One week! WOAH! :D I'm so proud of myself! :D

It hasn't been easy. Days 2 and 3 sucked big time. And at first, day 5 was a disaster. I was trying to enjoy a book, but apparently reading is a huge trigger to me. Yeeeah, great. So I started to write down quotes I really liked while reading to help myself focusing on the text, but that didn't help neither. My cravings made it impossible for me to concentrate.

So I went for a [walk](http://imgur.com/a/Nsi1q) for three hours in the afternoon, although it was raining and cold, just to distract myself from the cravings. I bought a delicious cheese-filled roll and some chewing gum in the village nearby, and enjoyed both while walking back home. I wouldn't have done that if I were still a smoker. It makes me happy that I'm way less sluggish now that I don't smoke anymore. :D Actually, I'm feeling much more alive now. Weird, because I've always connected smoking with living moments and feeling alive. Oh, how foolish I've been! I just need to collect such awesome moments and keep remembering them. And I need to relearn how to chill, without cigarettes. 

Furthermore, I rewarded myself with some [books](http://i.imgur.com/j3I9adI.jpg), a moka pot, some coffee and a leather-bound diary. I like that! :D

Moreover: 

* My lungs feel a bit better :D 
* On day 4 I was able to smell a smoker for the first time in.. years? :D It was weird!
* I've been with smokers several times now, while they smoked, and it worked! :D 
* Yesterday I had a nightmare. I dreamt that I was smoking a cigarette and regretted it big time! I was so relieved when I woke up and realized it was only a dream! :D Apparently I'm afraid of starting smoking again - that's a good sign, right? :D
* My skin has gotten way better :D
* I now have money for stuff I've wanted for a long time. Also, I'll be able to save some. Yay! :D 

Now the bad news: 

* Digestive problems. :/ Meh. 
* Also my metabolism seems to be sleeping. :/ 
* I've been gaining weight. 2,4lbs since I quit. I don't like that, not a bit!
* Difficulties in concentration. Evening classes have been giving me a hard time since I quit. I feel super stupid. :/

Also: I haven't drunk much alcohol in the last few years. Before that, I was partying quite a lot. But the last few years have been quite sober. I got drunk maybe 2-3 times a year, and I barely had a beer or so. Since I quit I've been craving for drinks. Wtf? Is my brain trying to replace one addictive substance with another? I've never had an alcohol problem, but this new appetite irritates me.

Alright! :D Thank you for helping me through my first smoke-free week, /r/stopsmoking! I don't think I would have made it without you guys! :D

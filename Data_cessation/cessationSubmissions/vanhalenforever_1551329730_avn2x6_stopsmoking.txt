Planning on quitting this saturday- any tips for a neurotic person who can't sit still and eats too much already?

Hello, 

As the title states I plan on quitting smoking this Saturday and I need a little personalized help. 

From how I see it there are three main issues that have stopped me from trying to quit:

1. I'm afraid of gaining weight during this process. I have sleep apnea and I'm pre diabetic, so I need to start losing weight pretty rapidly as it is.

2. I'm a writer, and I'm worried about losing my creativity. 

3. I can't really sit still, and every time I try to quit I lose all motivation to move. It's like my skeleton is trying to leap out of my body yet I'm stuck in bed sweating and coughing. 

So my current plan is just to use nicotine gum and lozenges for the first few days and then stop because I don't really want to prolong this process. 

I don't have a full time job and I'm worried about getting bored and wanting to light up. I also spend a lot of time playing first person shooters which requires a fair amount of focus (and can be quite irritating when you lose), so that's out of the question. 

The things that I figure might help: 

1. Having healthy foods like salad ingredients ready to go. 

2. Doing a few pushups when I get a craving. 

3. Go for long walks to tire myself out. 

4. Playing europa universalis or some other boring game that doesn't require much thought. 

Other than that, I don't know what to do. Any suggestions on how to keep my mind and body busy during this transition? 

Any help would be wildly appreciated!

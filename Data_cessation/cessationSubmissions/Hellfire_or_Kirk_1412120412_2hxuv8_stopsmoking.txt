Looking for a video

Hey guys, I'm trying to find a video that helped me quit. (Two weeks! Woot!) 

But I can't remember what it is. It was real cheezy, had a British guy talking to maybe 5 or 6 smokers about why they smoked, etc. Allen Carr method... The one with the little nicotine fiend thing?

My manager at work asked how I managed to stop and I wanna share the video with her.

Anyone else here hanging out here because they are going to make a run on quitting for lent?

I'm not religious but often to lent as an exercise in self control. This year I think I will try the big one: SMOKING. I've quit many times before, but for whatever reason the one month point is the downfall for me. With lent being six weeks, I'm hoping that gets me over the hump to smoke free this time.

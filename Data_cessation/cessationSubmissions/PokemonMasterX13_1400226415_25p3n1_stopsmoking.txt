Today is day one.

So begins my quest to stop smoking I've been smoking sense I was 17 I'm now 21 and engaged but my future wife told me I have to drop this habit. So does anyone know tips to quit? I've tryed before but I couldn't get over it I go 4 days then I have crazy strong cravings. People any one please help. I'm tired of smoking.

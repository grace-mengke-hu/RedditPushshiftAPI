Those of you who have successfully quit...

...what tips/tricks/techniques did you find to be most effective? Any one thing you credit for your success? Anything you wish you had known going into the quitting process?

I chose a 'throw everything at the wall and see what sticks' method, because I was determined. But I'd like to be able to distill the best advice for those in my life who still smoke (both brothers, several close friends).

Not sure why January 16th, but exactly a year ago I said "enough is enough".

Now looking back seeing all of these young and old soldiers fighting the battle like I was, remember that it gets better friends. 

I now don't have to stand to be around second hand smoke, have to leave dates to restock my nicotine, look at yellow teeth in the mirror, or even tolerate freezing my ass off to grab a quick puff.

Fuck that stupid animal slave behavior, and fuck addiction. You can do it friends. The entire internet is here to help.

Hi r/stopsmoking, I'm talking my 55yo mother to quit his 35+ years smoking, give me some advice.

I quit an 8+ years smoking myself, few years ago, it will be 3 years this april! But this is not the point of this post, altough I have some experience in the matter, 30+ years of habit are tough to beat.
She is going with the "I'll reduce slowly because I already did this years ago and it worked" (not, because she still smokes) and I'm suggesting her to stop suddenly and completely in order to have a firm grasp on the changes that happens after quitting smoke and have more control over it. It worked for me, but is this correct? What's your suggestion? Thanks in advance!

It's official!

Being smoke-free for 12 weeks means that my work will remove the $25 per paycheck fee for health insurance.  woo hoo! Add this to the amount to the money I save from not smoking and hell, I'm rich! :)

Some love for this subreddit: the comments I've read here are stellar, you guys are amazing. Thank you so much for helping me with my quit!

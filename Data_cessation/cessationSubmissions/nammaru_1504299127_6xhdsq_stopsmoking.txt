You guys ever have someone that is the source of all your pain?

TO me, that is my mother. She is a loving, warm person. The most dedicated person that one can meet. But there's no end to her just making me upset. And I think that feeling is mutual. 

I quit once, for about 2 months. I had to biggest argument with my mother. Over the smallest shit. She's very emotional and escalates things like no other. I relapsed then.

This time, I'm very close. If I had cigarettes somewhere, I would've smoked them. But I'm very, very close to driving over to the gas station. 

It's a pity that the person you love the most, is the source of all your troubles. She certainly is and I know a cigarette isn't going to repair our relationship.

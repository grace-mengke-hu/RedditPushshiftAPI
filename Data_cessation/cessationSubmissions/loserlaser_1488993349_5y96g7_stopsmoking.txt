I'm now 6 days into my quit (ignore the badge, it's wildly inaccurate) and I have a few questions.

I had my first cigarette at age 11. Smoked intermittently through my teen years (when I could get them). Picked up heavy smoking at 18 and have been a confirmed smoker for the last 14 years. 

I decided to give up nicotine for Lent. I was vaping and smoking anywhere from 2-10 cigarettes a day. Thursday 03/02/2017 I decided to give quitting a real go for Lent. And what do you know? It worked. I have no real cravings and I am doing fine. 

I have a few buggaboos though. 

1) I am having trouble with linear thought when verbalizing. Anyone else experience this? 

2) I am having really really weird dreams. Will these cease?

3) I haven't really coughed up any phlegm or anything. My nose is sort of stuffy, but I expected to be ejecting tons of crap but as of yet, nothing. Any reason for this?

Does anyone else keep forgetting they're quitting?

After smoking nearly a pack a day for 2 years, I'm quitting now cold turkey. I'm on day 3 currently and I don't actually find it all too hard. 

However, I keep forgetting I'm quitting which is probably the most frustrating. I keep getting dressed for a smoke break before I remember I can't smoke. I'm searching for my tobacco until I realize I've given it away. 

Does anyone else keep forgetting?

day 27. coughed and saw some blood in spit. erm.. help?

as per title. i was in the shower and just coughed, so i spat out saliva. saw that it was red, panicked a little, did it again, still red.

now i'm not talking full blown coughing out blood like in the movies when you get raped by, i don't know, face-hugging or chest-bursting aliens.

i'm talking some trails, swirls, strands, probably 50/50 blood/saliva concoction?

i used to have this randomly when i was smoking. last time this happened was over a year ago. and now this.

anyone had a similar experience? i don't wish to go to a doctor for something that i can't replicate and out of the blue.

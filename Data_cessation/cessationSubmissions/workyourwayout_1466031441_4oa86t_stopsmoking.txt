Almost through Day 7 and I'm feeling...good?

I've always hated the scent of cigarettes in my clothes and hair, the cloud that hangs over you when you smoke indoors, I hate that I can't get in the car without smoking triple what I normally smoke. I hate that I get angry because I can't take a cigarette break right when I want too. I hate that I smoke out of boredom. I hate that I lie to my mom and have to plan not smoking around her and not spending as much time with her as she would like, because I HAVE TO smoke a fucking cigarette. I hate being told to rinse my mouth out before I kiss someone because I taste gross. I hate how I'm broke, but spend any extra cash on a useless thing that I hate. I hate that my dental hygienist comments on my stained teeth and suggests quitting. I hate that I've been smoking for almost ten years. 

The past almost seven days(!) have been so much easier than I thought they would be. I guess I just got sick of tracing all of the negative to my smoking. I've pushed myself hard to hike every day and breathe and feel how my already fucked up lungs struggle up any elevation. 
I didn't follow 'the rules' that most sites suggest. I got tired of telling people that I'm quitting once again, so I used humility as a tool. 
Reading through smoking has really helped me to be honest about how I really dislike my awful habit and that I'm not alone. 
We can do this!

Grieving...

I just realized that I haven't experienced a grieving process this time around. Decided to quit, did it, no regrets, no looking back.Still can't believe this has worked as well as it has.But there's no grieving for a long lost friend and all that shit... I wonder why. Anyone else with the same experience?

I've realized something about these so called 'tests'

Since I quit smoking, I have been feeling like life is constantly 'challenging' or 'testing' me. First it was this exploded faucet incident I already mentioned, then the constant stress with my SO (doing her practicum, very intense), now my grandmother is about to die.

But then I realized - there are no tests. This is simply life, sometimes stressful and annoying and nothing has anything to do with smoking. It is just me who is framing it this way, trying to set myself up for a (as if justified by life being annoying) failure. Nah, fuck that shit. I ain't never gonna smoke!

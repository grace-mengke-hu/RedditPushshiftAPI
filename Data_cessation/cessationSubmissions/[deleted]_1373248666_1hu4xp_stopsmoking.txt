Starting (again) tomorrow! I promise!

I have two smokes left in the pack that I'm not going to enjoy, but am going to smoke.  


I've quit many times before, and I always find an excuse to start again.  This time, I'm done.  I have to be.  I need to be.  And most importantly, I WANT to be.  

No more excuses, no more bull shit.  Starting tomorrow, I am a non-smoker.  (I just hope I'm not a cranky bitch while in withdrawal).

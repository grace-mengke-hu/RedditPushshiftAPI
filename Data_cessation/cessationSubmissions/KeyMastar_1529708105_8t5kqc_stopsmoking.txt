Helping my Girlfriend Quit

Hey,

For reference, I have never smoked, only been surrounded by secondhand smoke. My girlfriend has been smoking for a while and after telling her about my issues with smoke (i have asthma and ive lost many to lung cancer from smoking), she scheduled a consultation. Her quit date is now a week from today and she has clonodine to help with withdrawl symptoms when she stops.

My question is how I can best support her stopping? I want her to know i support her and am there for her without being pushy or pressuring her too much. Anyone else have experience with this that can provide advice for how to support her journey best? I am so happy for her but i wanna not be a roadblock to her progress.

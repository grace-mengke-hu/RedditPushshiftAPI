What I have learned this year

The value of things decrease over time. The iPhone I bought last year cost me way more than its current price. This happens also with achievements. Imagine a degree you might have obtained years ago, its value might be smaller. Or not, it depends. 

But the beauty of quit smoking is that it works exactly the other way round. It costs you a lot at the beginning, cost that tends to be reduced up to almost nothing. The value, however, grows exponentially. This value of course is life quality. 

In other words: after 27 years of smoking 20 or more cigarettes a day, I stopped. The effort was significant at the beginning (just significant, not unbearable, impossible, or anything like that) and now most weeks I don't even think in cigarettes. But I do feel better. Way better. 

Sorry for the extension of this post, I am happy and just wanted to share.

Day One, coping with irritability.

First, dont judge me. I barely made the plunge to quit completely after cutting down drastically today. I ripped up my pack and threw it in the dumpster. Im eight months pregnant.  I have had the most difficult time quitting. Its the anger and irritability that get me the most. I have a three year old and work with kids who do not have proper guidance in life, and its a really stressful job. I can honestly say its a main contributing factor as to why im struggling. I feel horrible for how I jave continued to smoke while pregnant,  and have been honest with my OB about it. I finally came to that moment when I couldn't take the guilt anymore. I just could really use tips as to not let the anger and irritability consume me.

72 hours done, but hell if it isn't so difficult.

Any time I drive to/from college or work, or generally anytime I'm outside, I'm itching for a cigarette - I have nicotine gum but it's fairly disgusting, and I don't want to go the e-cigarette route.

I'm hoping my mental reflexes to go for a cigarette in these situations stop soon, but...how long will it be? Any advice? Thanks, all.

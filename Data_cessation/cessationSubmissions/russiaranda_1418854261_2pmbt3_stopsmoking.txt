Dramatically quit today...

19 y/o female smoker here.

Just now I was out for a smoke break in the rain/snow, and I realized how depressed I was with smoking. I turned on the bathroom sink, poured my Peter Jackson Menthols in and drowned them. 

I've been smoking since early summer. I started out smoking flavored cigars for quite a while beforehand and then it turned from Mint Colts to cigarettes. 

I'm not sure how to do this, and what quitting will be like. I am going from smoking a bit more than half a pack a day to nothing. 
Can anyone tell me what to expect or what to do? I'm honestly a bit scared.

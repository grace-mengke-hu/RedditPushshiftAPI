Hi. I'm trying to quit smoking again.

Hello , i'm 29. I've been smoking since 21-22 , so it's been almost 8 years. I quitted successfully for 11 months, 2 months, 1 month in different times. Since i want to save a little more money (not the main reason) and i want to get healthier, i'm smoking my last cigarette right now(after posting this shit), for a last goodbye, and then quitting for not to start again (never ever). 

I hope i can get out of this f*cking bad addiction as easy as i did before. Motivations are always welcome.

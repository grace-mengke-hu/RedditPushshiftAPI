Nicotine withdrawals after 3 weeks

I haven't smoked a cigarette for 20 days now. Been quitting with my boyfriend, he's been smoking for 15 whereas it's only been 5 for me. He needs an e-cig so he has it on him all the time. That means when I drink I'll puff on his. When I stop using the e-cig, the next day I feel horrible. Anxiety and just sick. Am I just giving myself withdrawal symptoms by having any nicotine at all, even if it doesn't seem like half as much as I did when I was smoking?

500. Some people can do it the first time. It's taken me at least 12. Just a few thoughts.

1. As I mentioned, it has taken me at least 12 previous quit attempts. The most important thing is to keep at it, quitting smoking has a low success rate but if you quit enough times...
2. Staying quit for me means no cigarettes *ever*. I was able to break the chemical addiction many times.  At least 6 of my previous quitting attempts, even one that was 9 months in, were derailed by a drunk cigarette. For me, I have to be a nazi about it even when I'm drunk and even after 500 days, if I have 1, it's just a matter of time before I'm smoking a pack a day again. 
3. There are lots of ways to quit that will help you though the first month or two.  Patches, gum, and wellbutrin all got me past the first month, but as I said, staying quit for me means no cigarettes ever, that was the hard part, not the chemical addiction. 
4. Everyone is different. Carr works for some, (I've never tried it) cold turkey works for others, some need chemicals. Do not think that NRT is bad just because someone on this sub said so.  Do not think cold turkey won't work for you because someone said it's hard. 
5. Hookah, dip, and ecigs all seem super dangerous to me as far as staying quit goes, but see point #4. 

*Good luck everyone, you can do it. This sub does help.*

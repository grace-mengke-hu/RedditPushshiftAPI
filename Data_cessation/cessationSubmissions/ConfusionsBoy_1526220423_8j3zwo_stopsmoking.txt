Really must quit.

So..going this Thursday for medical tests. Bloodwork, chest x-ray, already had pulmonary function test. Probably COPD. 

Doing better with meds the Dr. gave me, but still short of breath. Spending a lot of money on tests. Missing work. UGH.

The wonder of it? Still can't quit smoking. Been almost 48 hours since my last cigarette. Sigh. We will see.

I think smoking is a expression of unconscious self-loathing. Best explanation I have heard so far.

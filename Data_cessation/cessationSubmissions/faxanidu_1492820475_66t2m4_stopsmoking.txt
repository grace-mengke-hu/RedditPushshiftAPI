Need support

I have severe anxiety, heart palpitations, tired all the time. Just threw ciggs, out in rain. Freaking out a bit. Words of wisdom welcome.

Edit: Still going ok I bought like $5 worth of cinnamon toothpicks. They're helping allot. The craving for sweets though is crazy I'm a skinny guy so that's not to much of a problem. But damn. I ate a while bag of dark chocolate chips since I first posted. Also realized I posted on my birthday I'm 30 now. AMA btw. Helps keep my mind away.

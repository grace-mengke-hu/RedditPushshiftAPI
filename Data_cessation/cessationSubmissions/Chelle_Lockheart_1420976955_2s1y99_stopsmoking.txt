7 days.. A bloody week!

Thank you so much to everyone in this sub! Today I celebrate 1 week smoke free which is the longest I've ever gone! I posted here 8 days ago about my slip up after only 3 days! You guys helped me make it to 7! Woo hoo! God bless polo mints, e shisha's (nicotine free e-cig) and this community! :)

Is nicotine withdrawal worse each time you quit

First time I used nicotine for around a year.. quitting was so easy. 

4 months later I used nicotine for a month. Quitting brought some bad nausea and creepy crawly feelings. Nausea only came in waves. 

Last week I started using nicotine for 3.5 days and I’m currently on day 3 of withdrawal. I’ve been awake since 2am with almost constant, horrible nausea, even now almost 10 hours later. 

I thought I had figured out that withdrawal nausea came on because of changes in blood sugar... but idk. I’m close to visiting an urgent care doctor.

Back on the wagon, again

TL;DR: Been smoking off and on for 24 years, wanna be done, for good. I hope this forum will help me kick it once and for all.

Long Version: I didn't smoke till I was about 20, after joing the USAF in '94 and got to my first duty station. It became a way to meet new people, break the ice, and generally fit in. That went on till I stopped smoking using Allen Carr's book in '08. Picked it back up in '11 while deployed to Afghanistan. Quit when I got back, again using Carr's book. Started  again when I went back to Afghanistan in '13, quit when I got back. Stayed strong for about 3 months when I went to South Korea in '15 for a one year tour, and quit when I got back.  Now, I'm back smoking again. I don't know how to make friends without it. In the military, as you move up in rank your peers get fewer and fewer. It became hard for me to relate and form friendships partly because of the disparity in rank. Smoking became a way to break down that barrier. In the smoke pit everyone is somewhat equal, or at least rank doesn't seem to get in the way. It gives you a chance to "shoot the shit" and get know people without work or rank getting in the way. 
  After quitting the first time in '08, it felt like I'd Iost my main avenue to, I guess, humanize myself, to show that I'm just a person too, and not some NCO giving orders and whatnot. It was a hard time for me. I smoked while away from my family in part because I needed to fit in, and as nice as the AD has it while deployed it still sucked. Now I'm tired of using as a crutch, I want to be done with this shit for good.
  Thanks for reading this far, good luck everybody. We can do this!

Been smoking for 2 years. Day 3 of quitting, no cravings. You can do this.

Day 3- I'm slowly gaining my sense of smell back, and I went to the gym for the first time today and smashed it. When I was a smoker, even  a walk up the stairs got me breathless. Today, I inhaled deeply without that awful tightness for the first time in ages.

My main tips are 

- Find a new focus. Gym/ hiking are good suggestions. Your focus will be on wellness. 

- Do not 'fear' smoking/ anything smoking related (it gives it more power). I live with a smoker, so I'm always seeing lighters, ashtrays. I've accepted that I'm strong enough to not view these as triggers. 

- Lastly, find someone who believes in you! (This can even be yourself), Any support system is great- apps included. 

My boyfriend quit smoking a month or so ago. I asked him how he did it and he said 'I just thought of you. I did it for us.' I think this made me realise when you feel strongly about something, it overrides your addiction and really sets your priorities straight. 

As well as this,my mother has a chronic illness. She doesn't choose to be unable to run and breathe-
but I can make this choice. I felt almost selfish smoking away my life, and health.

To all of you, find that something!! Please. I hope you all discover how strong you are. Life can be so much more :)

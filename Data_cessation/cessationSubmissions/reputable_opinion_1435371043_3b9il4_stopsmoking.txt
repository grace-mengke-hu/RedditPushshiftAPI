4 months, can't handle second hand smoke - it gives me crazy cravings. Is it the freebase nicotine?

tobacco companies engineer nicotine to the freebase form.   it becomes much more effective absorptive and addictive in this form - even second hand.   

what do you suggest, short of suing the tobacco companies for a guy who works around a lot of smokers outside?

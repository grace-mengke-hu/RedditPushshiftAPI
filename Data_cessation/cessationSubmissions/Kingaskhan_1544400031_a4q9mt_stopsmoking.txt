Desperately trying to quit

Hey guys, i’m an 18 year old (M) who started smoking cigarettes at the age of 16, this was my year of trying to quit, i definitely havent been smoking like i used to but i still do occasionally and it bothers me now. I moved from my home country to Italy a couple of weeks ago to start studying Medicine (ironic isnt it) ever since i came here i’ve been smoking in my free time and it started to bother me now. 

I need help, i need help from people who have successfully quit smoking, i go to the gym pretty much every day, which i found to help with my addiction for smoking a lot. I would like to get some advice on what could help me quit smoking once and for all, any tip would be appreciated, thank you a lot in advance.

Question about voice after quitting!

Ok so long story short, has quitting smoking effected the way your voice sounds? Just curious, I know I've gotta quit and can't use this as an excuse, but I'd like to know. Did your voice lose that slight raspyness? What about deepness? What is your experience with quitting?

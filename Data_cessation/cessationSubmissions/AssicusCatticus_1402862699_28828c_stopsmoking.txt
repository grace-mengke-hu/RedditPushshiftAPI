19 Days and Counting...

I had major surgery 19 days ago.  While in the hospital for three days afterward, it became clear that I had hugely high blood pressure, way up in stroke territory.  That shit scared me!  One of my grandparents died of a stroke at just 69 years old, so I've got a special fear of stroking out or having a massive aneurysm or something.

Well, I am on medication now and I stopped smoking cold-turkey.  My sweet and wonderful SO quit with me and it's been very hard, especially with as confined as I've been since the surgery!  

It's weird how different things taste.  I've got to get some new coffee (and I've reduced that and soda, too) because my old coffee tastes like ass without the mask of cigarettes!  I've walked by a few people and can smell the smoke on them, and it surprises me that I never noticed it on myself.  

I've been smoking for a couple of decades...almost two and a half!  I want to stop.  I want to be done and never feel the need for one again!  I know it won't happen like that.  There have been some very stressful moments when the craving was so bad, I couldn't stop thinking about it for hours!

But I guess it comes down to wanting to be healthier more than I want to smoke.  I've recovered enough now to take short walks and plan to go for a stroll when I feel the need to have a cigarette.  I've always hated trying to smoke a cigarette while walking, so I hope this will be a good way to get a bit more exercise and battle cravings.  It rains a lot here...I might need really good rain gear or a treadmill!

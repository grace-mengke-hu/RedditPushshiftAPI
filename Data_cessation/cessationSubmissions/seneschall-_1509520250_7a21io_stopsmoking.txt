Feeling more tired, and less motivation, 25 year smoker

Not sure if it's quitting smoking, or the fact I also quit drinking at the same time.  I was both a heavy smoker and drinker, so it's been almost a month for quitting both now.  

Problem is, I barely want to leave home now.  No motivation other than to do home stuff and studies with my 6yo.  

Is this normal?  Or with the lack of smoke/alcohol, am I uncovering something deeper that only sobriety &amp; a cleaner system would reveal?

Day 5.

I keep feeling like I’m forgetting something. The weather has been fucking perfect for a smoke but I keep resisting the urge to drive to the shops and buy a pack so ‘I can just have one’. 

Cravings are going crazy today. Everything I’ve been using to distract myself... walking the dog, yoga, tidying up... not working. I fear if I leave the house I will break and have a smoke. 

I part of me actually wants to cry.

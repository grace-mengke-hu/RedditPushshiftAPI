Well here goes nothing...

I am at day 3 of "not smoking" I picked myself up a cig pen, completely have smoked since trying to quit I think 4 the first day and 2 yesterday I am two in today (with the pen) I have been a pack a day or more smoker for the last 13 years or so. I just really want to quit. I have tried before but not really if you know what I mean. I am tired of hearing myself say " I need to quit" And I always say it right before I light up a cig. wtf me, wtf. I knew I'd quit when I wanted to and I'm at that point now. So wish me will power and luck.

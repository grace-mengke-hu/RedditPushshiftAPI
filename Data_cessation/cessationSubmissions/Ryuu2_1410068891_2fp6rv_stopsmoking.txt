Hey guys!

Been lurking here for the past week and figured I should finally post.

Little bit about me: Been smoking for the past 12 years or so (26 now). First got hooked when a friend told me that it goes well with pot..lol. Well 12 years later, and I'm still smoking! And heres the kicker: I'm in medical school. I should know better. I've seen the consequences of this fucking addiction but an addict's mind does not look at things in rational matter!

However, I had a terrible hangover last Sunday after a night out and decided it was time to let this go. My lungs were hurting bad and I just had to reevaluate all this. Is it an ideal time? Not really, I have the most important exam in my life coming up in 2 months...but its never an ideal time. I've been putting off quitting for years. It was always "after this next exam" or "once I get a break" but that never works. So decided not to smoke for the rest of the day and kept it up in the days following. 

And you know what? This quit seems different...it FEELS different. My cravings have been manageable. I don't yearn for cigarettes like I did in the past. For me, I think changing my mindset made the world of a difference. I was tired of feeling like the worlds biggest hypocrite. But I digress...reading your posts and comments has been a huge help through this whole process.  I love you all.

**TL;DR** Medical student smoker (yeah i know..wtf?)..stopped smoking last week, feel goooood and makin all types of gains!

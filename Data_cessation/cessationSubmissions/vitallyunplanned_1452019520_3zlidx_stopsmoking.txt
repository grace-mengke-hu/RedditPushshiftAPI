Caved after 4 days. Will the next four days be the same as the last regarding withdrawal symptoms?

I didn't smoke for four days, I was having some really bad cravings. My girlfriend really wants me to quit and says it's a deal-breaker for her so I want to quit for that reason. She's just gone out to work and I was left alone in the flat with our flatmates cigarettes on the table so obviously I had one. 

People say the first three days are the hardest and if you can get through those then the rest is easier. Will it be the same for the next three days even though I just had one cigarette?

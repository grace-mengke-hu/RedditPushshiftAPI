NEVER GIVE IN

This has been one tough week. First I am proud to say 98 days smoke-free. So this week started out with my prostate cancer Dr. Telling me the cancer may be back after having my prostate removed 3 years ago then followed up with 9 weeks of radiation due  to, prostate removal not. getting it all. So I had my 3 year PSA test done to only find out my cancer is still there. I have an appointment with my cancer Doctor To set a path forward. On top of this my regular Dr. orders a bone scan done due to me complaining of back pain. ”just wanted to, get physical therapy”. Anyway the radiology center informs my Dr. who informs me the radiology center wants another scan due to finding a large cyst in my stomach area. If there was ever a time that a cigarette should be smoked it was at 4PM EASTERN TIME TODAY!! Instead I had dinner with friends and am now heading to sleep. Whatever comes my way I, will fight to the end and never will I smoke another cigarette because that doesn't fix a FUCKING  thing. IT ONLY MAY CAUSE CANCER. THINK OF THAT every time you think you need a cigarette 
Thanks for hearing my bitching

Hit a bit of a milestone yesterday...

Yesterday was my 24th day without smoking. Since Day 1, I've been using the Kwit app on my iPhone to keep track of my progress - how many days, how much money I've saved, how many cigs I haven't smoked, etc. It's been great for keeping me motivated whenever I'd get the urge to have a smoke - instead of pulling out a pack of cigarettes, I'd pull out my phone and tell myself, "You don't really want to go back to zero, do you?"

This morning I realized that yesterday was the first day where I didn't open the Kwit app even once. It simply never even crossed my mind. I think I might have crossed some kind of a threshold.

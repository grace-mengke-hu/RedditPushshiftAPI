Okay guys I was here two years ago and I’m back. Today I lock myself in my house, have my wife take me keys and money. I’m sweating this out.

I am 24 ^fuck I’ve been smoking now for 6 years. And for 5 I’ve been trying to quit. For the next 2 days I’m sweating it out and stoping this horrible habit. Feel free to talk with me in the comments to keep me preoccupied. If anyone here plays xbox feel free to add me GT. ItsMrJimLahey. 

Wish me luck guys!! I’ll update as the days goes on

Edit: It’s been about 8 hours and I feel awful. Thank you for everyone cheering me on. I am about a pack and a day smoker and I literally live for the next cigarette. So this is very demanding for me. I feel a really strange sensation all of my body and my head is all jumbled up 

Edit 2 : 5 pm it’s been 12 hours and holy shit this is terrible. I’m doing better though. I’m starting to time these cravings and they happen every 20 minutes or so and last 3-5 minutes. I still have this crazy tingling sensation all over my body and my chest hurts. Thanks for all the wonderful advice. It’s insane how much 12 hours with out cigarettes can effect your whole body

Edit 3: 4:30 am I’m wide awake can’t sleep but I’m starting to not feel as angry. I still have this weird pain in my chest and tingling feeling everywhere.

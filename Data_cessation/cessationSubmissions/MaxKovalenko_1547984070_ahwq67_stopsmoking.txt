Captain's Log - Day 17

this is day 17. there are only a very few moments in which id like to have a smoke. i used to smoke in the car. guess what. i still arrive at the places where i want to go even without the cigarettes. i used to smoke in the breaks at college between the lectures. guess what. youll be still alive after the break without the cigarettes. im actually a bit grossed out of myself. i really needed it. my roommates still smoke a lot. even in the flat.

so now that the biological addiction is neutralized and i really dont think about smoking that often its only about staying strong in this few moments when youre with people and having a smoke would be just the creamtopping of the conversation because smoking is companionable.

since i did not have that much of withdrawal symptoms im curious: how did you guys experienced the first weeks? what did you noticed? me? i noticed a lot of pimples and spots on my face but they are already gone.

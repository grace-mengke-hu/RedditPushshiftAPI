Today I had my first real temptation, but I didn't smoke!

I haven't left the house much since I started this journey. Today, my boyfriend and I went out for food and he bought a pack of cigarettes on the way home. At first I thought, just one wont hurt, I haven't smoked at all since I quit. But he waited a while to light it up, and in that time I made the decision that I didn't need it. He smoked right next to me, in the car, and I never asked for a drag! 

Small victories are what keep me going. <3 Keep it up guys! Each day is a new day!

Dreaming smoke!

So, It's been 22 days since my last cigarette. I have gone to where I failed many times, through drinking and partying, and not smoking. And today, in a dream, I was explaining to my mother that I had just quit (I haven't told her yet) and somehow I had in front of me two cigs and a lighter... So, in addition to the explanation, I put one in my mouth, and light the lighter close to the tip of the cigarette. Then, SOMEHOW, even in my dream I was able to think: "this is bullshit!" And put the cigarette away. I can't believe I did that, specially after reading some stories here of people smoking in their dreams and feeling bad about it. 
I've been a smoker for 11 years, and I think I'm gonna be able to  quit this time. :)

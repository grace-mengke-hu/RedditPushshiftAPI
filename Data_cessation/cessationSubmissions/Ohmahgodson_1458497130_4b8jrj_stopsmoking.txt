My phone with the QuitNow! App died... forgot how many days it has been.

Holy crap! Smoking seems like a distant memory to me now. I still get the occasional craving (more of a "I used to smoke during *insert whatever I'm doing*), but it never lasts more than a minute or two.

DONT get discouraged when a craving strikes. Each time I use it to focus on the positive. 

Most people are afraid to quit smoking because they are afraid of the cravings. Well as a smoker? I'd have a craving every 45 minutes. Now its a bad week if I have more than 2. Its the SMOKERS who have to deal with cravings all the time! Not us!

Stay strong everyone. I'm sending postive vibes to everyone, especially those of you on day 1, 2, and 3. This gets SOOOO much easier if you just let yourself have some time.

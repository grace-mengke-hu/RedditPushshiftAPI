How can I help my boyfriend deal with withdrawal symptoms/help him quit?

He smoked cigarettes when I first met him, then he switched to vaping. This weekend he decided to quit nicotine cold turkey, threw his vaping stuff out and everything.

He's been having headaches and is generally a bit irritable, but I'll gladly deal with that because I know the benefit is so great!! I'm really proud of him. So I'm just wondering, are there things I can do to help him? Stuff I can say? Anything I can give him to help with withdrawal symptoms?

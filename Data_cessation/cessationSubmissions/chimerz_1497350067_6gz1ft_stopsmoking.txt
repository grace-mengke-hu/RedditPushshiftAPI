Substituted smoking cigarettes for e-cig

So today marks 1 week cigarette free. I have smoked for roughly 10 years, and this will be my 2nd time quitting. Only this time I have substituted cigarettes with e-cigarettes containing nicotine.

It has been a completely different experience this time. I put that down to the fact that I am still getting my nicotine hit. So I wanted to know everyone's opinion.

Does it still count as quitting? Should I start making a plan to quite the vape? Any advice or feed back would be helpful!

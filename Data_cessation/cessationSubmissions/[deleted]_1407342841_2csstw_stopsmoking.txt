Tired all the time

So I'm halfway through my 3rd day and I'm curious..is being tired all the time normal? I'm drinking coffee like I usually do but I just seem to be tired a lot. I usually went to bed at 3/4 am (due to work) and now I go to bed at 11:30 pm/12:30 am and today I am just very very tired.

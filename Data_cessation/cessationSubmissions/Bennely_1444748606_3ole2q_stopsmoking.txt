Day One. Patch on, frustrating and buzzing.

I am here and making this post to distract myself. I have just subscribed to this sub to help me out. 

I've been a smoker for almost twenty years. I've stopped a few times before, but it's time to really try again. Every time I've stopped before it's been cold turkey. The first few days being almost unbearable, but with the idea that I need to get the nicotine out of my body. The first time went well and I had stopped for a considerable amount of time. The second lasted about eight months. The last attempt, in November of last year, lasted about three days. The stress broke me. 

I met with an RN a few weeks back. She told me of the benefits of the patch, sent me home with a box of smoking cessation goodies (thank goodness for socialized medical care!) and told her that today was going to be my quit date. 

I didn't think much of it again until late last night.

So I woke up this morning and slapped one of the patches on me. The feeling is very strange. I feel like I simultaneously need and do not need a cigarette.  It's like a dull buzz that has me on edge.  Part of me wishes I could just sleep for the next three days and wake up without the physical addiction gnawing at my brain. 

Has anyone else stopped with the patch or tried stopping with the patch before?  Any advice to share here? For the record I'm on the step 1 patch - for people who would smoke more than 10 smokes a day. 

I have gum and lozenges for when it gets really bad, but I'm also just trying to ween nicotine out of my system. I know that the patch doesn't help with that but I'm trying to change my smoking behaviours first. 
  
Anyway, I haven't had a cigarette in 12 hours. I look at all of the flair here (x00's days) and it really is the beginning of a long battle. Have to start somewhere, right?

To all the early on quitters

I used to smoke as soon as I got out of bed. Now I do not think about smoking anymore before I go to bed, nor when I wake up. I do not think about smoking for days, even though it used to be on my mind every 10 minutes. You can and will get over this if you stay strong. You need to get through the rough patch. Really it does not make you happy in the long run. I haven't been this chill and happy and years and that is without smokes. Also, my bank account thanks me and my health. Please see the evil of this poison. It is not good for you. Love yourself, quit, be happy and healthy and spread the positivity to others. You can do this. I know.

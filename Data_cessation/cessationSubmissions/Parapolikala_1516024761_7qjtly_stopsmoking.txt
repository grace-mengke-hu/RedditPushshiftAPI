Small stuff that's getting better

I stopped at New Year and have been having an okay time of it. Allen Carr's philosophy of "you're not giving up anything" really helped me get my mindset right. I've had some pangs, but nothing too bad. And what has really been good are the small ways I am seeing things improve:

1. I am singing better. That is a big deal for me, as I am the singer in a band, and had really noticed my voice deteriorating as my smoking increased over the last few years.

2. It doesn't stink at home (I used to smoke in my cellar den).

3. I don't stink. No more compulsive washing to remove fag smells.

4. Physical health - I notice "more energy"; instead of every lull in activity being a reason to light a fag, I find I am doing other stuff, and even went for a run yesterday (2 miles, wasn't hard).

5. Mental state. Apart from the odd grumpy phase, I am also feeling better in my head. 

6. Insomnia. I think my insomnia must have been related to late night smoking. I am now getting sleepy at normal times.

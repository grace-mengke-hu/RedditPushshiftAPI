Tabex, it is working for me

My brother sent me this article-http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/pill-promises-a-safer-cheaper-way-than-chantix-to-quit-smoking/2015/05/15/8ce5590c-f830-11e4-9030-b4732caefe81_story.html

I decided to try it and what do you know, it is working.  Much like Chantix but no prescription needed, no bad side effects and only costs 30.00 for a monthly supply.  

Wanted to share this so it might help others

2,5 days!

i havent smoked since 2018! :)
i told myself id stop on new years. i heard and read people say it doesnt help to set a date, but trying to quit suddenly just didnt do it for me. i didnt tell people and kinda knew it wasnt happening. 

month ago or more i tried quitting and failed. i got annoyed and told myself okay. you are a smoker. you like it but you also know you dont and its underwhelming and gross. it has only downsides to it. you get a month to smoke then youre done. i told people so it will be awkward if i fail.

so now i havent since new year, 11:59pm. 


writing this bc its 2:38am and i cant sleep. its been easier than i thought, but i planned it so im alone for some days now and ive just been playing games all day. sleeping late. not going out so i have the oppurtunity to buy smokes.
nervous for tomorrow as im meeting family, all smokers. and for when school starts. but i will try my best. they know i quit.

cravings are worst when im outside, near a kiosk or a store. i go back and forth in my head so much, trying to give myself an excuse to smoke and then practically forcing myself to keep walking. its wild. but im glad ive made it this far

wish me luck, and good luck to everyone else starting 2019 smoke free!

PLEASE for the love of god help me...

TLDR attempt:

- Started nicotine @ 13 y/o.  After first smoke I wanted another and another every 30-60 min.

- approx 3-5 smokes/day-age [13-16]; 5-10 [16-18]; +/- Pack daily [18-22]

- have severely addictive personality

- use/have used tobacco in every form (cigs, long-cut chew, leaf-chew [redman], snuff(snorting tobc-powder, cigars, e-cigs)

- breaks at work are VERY regimented.... @ EXACTLY break1, pre-lunch, post lunch, break2, i NEED it.

- 1 yr ago 2-3 hrs no prob; now i shake after 2-3 hrs

____________________________________________________

- getting gum surgery in 5 days.  cant have nicotine in any way (because blood-flow) 2-3 days pre-op, 3 weeks post-op. so i have to cold-turkey

- considered prescription pills but the downer-side effects are too high risk for me and it is too late.

- #1 motive is $$$$. but cant comprehend life w/o my true-love. ive experienced addiction to many things....and now i really believe the statement that "nicotine is 10x worse than Heroin."

- the horror of the first 1-3 days is breaking me now (but i can bite a bullet through it... but the long-term mental part is what makes it impossible. after-meal, after-sex, during-drunk; I. CANT. LIVE. WITHOUT. IT.

- the concept alone is already destroying me.  I dont want to quit, but i know i have to.  

- My physical condition is pathetic (im at peak age and strength with a very lean, athletic body- but it takes 5 min for me to recover my breath after dragging a heavy object for 90 seconds)

I could go on and on and on.... just typing this is going to require me to burn two.....I just legitimately believe this is 100% impossible for me.... 

can anyone convince me otherwise ? I need hope.

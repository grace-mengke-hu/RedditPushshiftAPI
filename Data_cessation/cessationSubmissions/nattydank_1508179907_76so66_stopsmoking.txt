1 hour away from day 10!

and feeling great! thanks to all for your support on my last post :) one of the biggest benefits i've noted is in my breathing - i don't wake up with a hacking cough any more, i don't get out of breath as easily going up stairs, and i can breathe through my nose VERY comfortably now, all the time! i can't believe i just thought i was a mouth breather for years...

still traveling and currently in a city with TONS of pollution. the weather app i use describes it as "haze" which is surprisingly appropriate. we spent about 8 hours on the road today, driving past trash fires and through tons and tons of diesel exhaust. all day i've had a bit of a dry cough and this vague tight feeling in my chest that i think is bronchospasm. still going to be breathing in all this dust and fumes for 5-6 more days x.x but this cough, in comparison to how GOOD my lungs have felt for the last few days, really makes me feel great about quitting smoking. it almost makes me nervous how little difficulty i've had so far. pretty sure it's bc im traveling now and the real test will be when i get back home, in familiar settings, in which i had 3 cigs in a row the last time i was there...

going to keep making posts to look back on when i get home as a reminder of how positive this has been so far and how strong i can be. and how much of that strength is from support from you guys! we got this :)

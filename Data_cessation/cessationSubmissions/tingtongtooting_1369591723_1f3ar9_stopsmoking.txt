47 days! What a feeling! (xpost from r/self)

So I posted this on /r/self, and someone suggested I check out this subreddit. I have lurked here before but thought I didn't have strength to stop. You guys are amazing!!

I just needed to tell someone that I haven't touched a cigarettte in 47 days! I didn't even think about having one - even causally - for about a week and a half now and I'm still going strong! :) It's *so* tough because pretty much *all* of my friends are heavy smokers, so hanging out with them has become a test of perseverance for me. It's proving to be going well so far!

To those who are trying to quit, don't give up! Each time a craving kicks in, it's just your body's way of testing you now that you're that much closer to stopping. You can be in charge of your body, you can control your cravings, and you most definitely don't need money-sucking, wrinkle-inducing, cancer-causing sticks of pure poison.

***YOU CAN DO IT!!***

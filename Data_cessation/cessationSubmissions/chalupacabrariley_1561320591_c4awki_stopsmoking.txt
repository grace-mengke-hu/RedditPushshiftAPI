Going through a divorce, smoking like a train, can't seem to get it together.

Hi all,
I quit smoking years ago, but going through a divorce I reached for the first vice I could think of. I keep saying no more and then emotions hit and I reach for that vice again. I'm finding it really difficult to have some willpower to give it up. Please help.

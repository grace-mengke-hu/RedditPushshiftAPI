How

How do I quit? I have no willpower. I am constantly sick with bronchitis. I'm smoking a cig as I am writing this... Recovering from pneumonia. It's so hard. I need help and support. I don't want to die. My 5 year old daughter needs me. I've watched smoking kill family members and friends. I'm afraid to try because I'm set up for failure. 98% of the people I know are smokers. I can't avoid them. I have a job at a convenience store which stresses me and I want to smoke constantly. I'm sorry for the jumbled up mess, but I'm desperate. Do any of you have this problem??? I am lost and scared because I feel like I can't do it.... Thank you for listening. Any advice anyone can give me. Thank you. So much.

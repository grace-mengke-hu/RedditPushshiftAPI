When will I be able to think/study again? Really terrible brainfog and anxiety (Day 3 nicotine free)

Feels like a miracle that I'm able to write. Can't focus on anything, feels like my mind is made of dough, and I'm shaking. This is day 3 since I had any nicotine.. 

I am freaking out since I have not been able to accomplish any studying or anything even barely useful this week. 

Any advice on how to deal with this horrible brainfog would be appreciated!

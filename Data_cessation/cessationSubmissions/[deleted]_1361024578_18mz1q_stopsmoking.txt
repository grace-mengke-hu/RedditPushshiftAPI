10 years I've wasted, finally ready to quit again

I'm 26, and I've been smoking since I was 16. 
10 years.
10 years of my life wasted.
I've lost count of the number of times I've quit. 
I'm doing this for my son, I want him to see me as more than a smoker. Someday I want to be able to tell him I quit for both of us. He is three years old and tries to imitate me smoking, it breaks my heart. 
My husband is a smoker, so this will be hard! I always start up again after I quit (my longest quit was 15 months). 
BUT I know I can do this if I stay strong! I can do it for me and I can do it for my baby boy :)

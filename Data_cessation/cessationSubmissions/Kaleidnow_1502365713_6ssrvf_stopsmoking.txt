What worked for me. Mission 19 - bonus points, Smoke Free app

Things that have worked:
Using this app
Staying busy
Being around friends and family who are non smokers
Increasing my willpower
Not caring too much about putting on weight
Going for runs and dieting instead of starting to smoke again when I did start to worry about my weight...

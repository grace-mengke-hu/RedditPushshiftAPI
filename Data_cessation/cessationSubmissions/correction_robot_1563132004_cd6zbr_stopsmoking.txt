Want to quit quitting for good

Not as in quit my current quit, but quit the cycle of quitting and then buying nicotine for some stupid excuse a few days later, or picking up a can of dip on a road trip after being off it a year.               
                      
                
Day 11!! The first few days sucked, but it wasn't so terrible. It's not like I was writhing in pain or sweating all day. Weird sleep, slight GI issues, and irritability were there, but all were quite tolerable. After waking up on Day 5 it has been a breeze. Moving over to r/StopDipping because I had switched to that, and it's kind of dead. This is a good support sub. Thank you for being you!

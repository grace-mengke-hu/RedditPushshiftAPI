BODY ACHES... WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS?

So I’m currently on my trip for my friends graduation.. And I’m doing great. Have been having no real cravings or even a real urge to take a drag.. 

But last night was rough. I had a rough time handling the different types of alcohol we were putting together.. Which was no big deal, until I got car sick on the way home.. (Dallas is hella spread out) but that has literally never happened to me... 

Anyway, so I get home and I get situated.. but by the time I laid down I had body aches that kept me awake until 7am (got home at 3). I ended up taking a cold shower to shock my system and doing some circulation exercises. But those aches were nothing like I ever experience before.. 

They are not as bad today but are still there... has any body ever experienced this in withdrawal?

What is it about a cigarette that nicotine replacement doesn't quite do?

Hello all. I've been going back and forth between cigarettes and ecigarettes. I just went 2 weeks without a cigarette, just using the ecig and I find that there's just something missing with the ecig. I sometimes smoke my ecig to the point I have a headache from too much nicotine - but I have a smoke and I feel better. What is it that a cigarette does that plain nicotine doesn't? I'm convinced there's some other chemical effect. I have read Alan Car's book and the main premise is that all a cigarette does is relieve the withdrawal from nicotine - I don't buy it.

I have chronic joint and muscle pain (from a genetic condition similar to arthritis - I'm in my 20's) - somehow all the nicotine from gum or ecig doesn't help, but a cigarette does. Marijuana is not a good option for me, and the only other alternative I can think of is opiates and that's not a good idea either. But neither are cigarettes.

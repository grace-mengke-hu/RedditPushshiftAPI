New Cravings after 400+ Days.

Hi everyone. Just wanted to check if somone can relate to my experience right now.

When I stopped over a year ago, I constantly wanted to smoke. After a few months cravings reduced drastically. Really, for the last 100 - 150 days I had whole weeks withot thinking about smoking.

Since last week or so I again have strong cravings nearly every day. Nothing in my life changed much. Sure I am kind of stressed right now, but I always was during the process.

The cravings are not strong enough to make me fail though. I am 100% sure that I will not fuck up after more than a year. Just wanted to hear if somone experienced similar 'lagged' cravings.

Feeling free!

I drank a margarita yesterday!  First time drinking alcohol since quitting, first time in a decade drinking without experiencing heightened withdrawal from nicotine.  I did not crave a cigarette, since I have no nicotine in my system from which to withdrawal.  It was cool, and it made me realize why some people are able to have just one "unwinding" drink.  Cigarettes have influenced so much behavior and so many decisions in my life.  Fuck them!  No more!

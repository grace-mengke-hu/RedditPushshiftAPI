First holiday..

I really need your advise..I am a little afraid that smoking will ruin my beloved holiday! 
After quitting I had a lot of work to do and therefore not the time to go out, drink and so on..but next week I am on vacation with my guys (everyone of them smoking -.-) and naturally we will go out and have more than one beer the nights ...AND THATS the Probleme , summer &amp; alcohol &amp; good mood ..do you have some experience with this kind of situations? I would be very grateful for some tips and support! :)

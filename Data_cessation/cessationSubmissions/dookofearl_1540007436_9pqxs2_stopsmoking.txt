Lookong for feedbck about Nicoderm patch.

Hello - I got the Step 1 patches since I smoke half to one pack a day. I put the patch on the other night since the directions say that if you wake up craving a cigarette to wear it over night. It kept me up all night! Has anyone else had this same experience? Someone I talked to said to cut the patch in half and wear it that way. If I cut it in half do I save the other half to wear later or just throw it away? The directions say that the patch looses potency when exposed to air. Sorry if this is silly question. Thanks and have a great day!

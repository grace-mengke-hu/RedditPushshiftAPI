Pro-tip for quitting with Easy Way: listen with focus and singleness of purpose

I quit with the easy way audiobook a couple years ago. At the time, I was unemployed and didn't have much else to do. So I listened to the whole audio book in the two nights, was completely focused on two things: smoking, and the book. Whole time I was listening to the book, I kept thinking, yadda yadda, i've heard this all before. Book ends: voila.  magic. done smoking. from 10 years of pack a day to nothing with no withdrawal pangs or desire to smoke. 

welllll a couple years later I started a new very stressful job with a bunch of germans that chain smoked. a month in I was back at it. classic "i'll just have one" story. about 6 months of pack a day smoking again and i had had enough and it was time to quit. again. so i tried the book. again. no luck. again. still no luck. again. nothing. so i quit quitting. I couldnt figure out why the book didn't work. 

turns out it was because i was doing distracted listening and not fully paying attention to either my smoking or the book. I just quit again with the book, as easy as before. the difference? The previous few tries with the book I was listening while doing other things. on the train, at work, etc. This time I did as before: two nights of doing nothing but smoking and listening to the book. POOF. magic. done. 


grateful to be free once again. crossing fingers it stays that way this time.

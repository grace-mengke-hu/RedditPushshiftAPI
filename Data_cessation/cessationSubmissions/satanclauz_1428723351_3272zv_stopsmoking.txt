The button.

Have you pressed the button yet? No? 

Why not?

You know you want to press it, but, you make a conscious decision to NOT press the damn thing. Even though countless other people are doing it.

* Nope. Right now I'm making the decision to not press the button.

But, you had a bad day. Someone ran over and fucked your dog. SHIT I need to press the button, it's OK because of this stupid shit that happened!

* Nope. Right now I'm making the decision to not press the button.

Worked my ass off to get to the button page. 

I just want to relax and press the button. I've earned it.

* Nope. Right now I'm making the decision to not press the button.

What does pressing the button do for you?

Absolutely nothing.

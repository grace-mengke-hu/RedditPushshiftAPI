i thought i still had few days to 4 months. It was a good surprise :-). The interval between cravings are quite long now that i cant even remember the last time i've had one. Also the need to login to this sub for support gradually subsides. i login every now and then and dont really stay that long. What helped me the most apart from the infamous Allen Carr's easy way is the reality about triggers and how not to avoid them. /u/Armison made it happen :-)

Please help me

Hey guys, I'm currently 23 years old, and I've been smoking for about four years now (A pack a day). I've tried to quit like a million times and I've never been able to do it. The thought of quitting is really scary for me because I've never been able to go more than a week at max.   


I really want to quit smoking. I hate feeling tired all the time, I hate the smell, I hate everything about it, but for some reason, I can't seem to fucking stop. Smoking makes me feel terrible, but not smoking does that to me too. I feel irritated all the time, I get headaches, I get a lot of cravings, and it's just terrible. I don't what to do. I downloaded the smoke free app, and it's helped a bit, but I always go back.

All my friends are smokers, and every time I'm around them, I get irresistible urges and I end up smoking to. I don't want to avoid my friends. I can't tell them not to smoke either, because that's completely up to them and is none of my business. I don't want to lose my friends, and I don't want to smoke either.

The problem for me is I don't have anyone to talk to about this. I can't talk to my family because I'm very ashamed of myself (I come from a conservative part of the world, I'm terrified of telling my parents), my friends all smoke and they really aren't able to see this like I see it. It's a natural, normal part of life for them.  I just want someone to talk to about this. It's literally just been two days since I smoked and I'm getting cravings all the time.

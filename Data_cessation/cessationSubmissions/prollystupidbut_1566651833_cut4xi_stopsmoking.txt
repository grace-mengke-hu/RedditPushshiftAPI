Drinking without a cigarette? Mission impossible.

I recently stopped smoking, with no big difficulty. Problem is I had a few beers (A tradition and a Friday ceremony of mine) and would've sold my mother for a pack of cigarettes. It sucks, because I have to stop my tradition of drinking blond cold beer every Friday and spit on the heritage of my ancestors.

Wellbutrin questions...

Hi all - I am new to this sub, and was curious about any experiences with Wellbutrin. I was prescribed this a few months ago, specifically for smoking cessation, but have been procrastinating on taking it, largely because of the alcohol warnings on the label. I am a fairly light drinker (glass of wine with dinner 2-3 times a week or when out at a restaurant), and I am worried about any interaction. Do I need to abstain from drinking entirely while taking it? Any feedback on experiences with this would be appreciated. Thank you!

The first 3 days.

I'm about an hour below the 24 hour mark and I've already long passed my longest without a smoke (19 hours). 

I'm curious though. Today, oddly enough, hasn't been bad. I had no cravings yesterday and I've had one tiny one that was gone in about 5 seconds after it popped up. 

Iv'e been hanging around my cousin and my mother who are smokers and that's not a trigger. 

So I have to remain curious.. Is it possible that day 3 (and on) is going to be easy? I mean, this is supposed to be hell week and it sort of feels like "meh" week. 

Also, the worst part of all of this so far was the first two hours of my morning. I just felt nauseas with no energy but that's passed now and I feel great! It's really something else. 

Well, I'd love some more feedback! Thanks for the support guys! :D

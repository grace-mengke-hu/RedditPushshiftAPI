My purple hands...well...went away.

Just wanted to share this anecdote with those of you struggling to quit. 5 years ago I had my picture taken, and one of my nephew later saw the picture and commented on my hands: "Why are your hands purple NulloK? WHy do you have purple hands?!" I though "what the heck is that kid talking about?!"...looked at the picture and sure enough,- my hands did indeed look purple in the picture. Soon after that I quit smoking (using Allen Carr's method) and after two weeks I get this tingling sensation in my hands. Turned out the blood circulation to my hands were restored slowly by itself. Anyway...I have pink hands again! Also...my wife and I had tried to become pregnant for a couple of years, with no luck...After I quit smoking, my wife became pregnant within a month. Might be coincidental, but still...

Good luck...

Benadryl? Oh yeah.. day 2, also.

So... having quit smoking and not wanting to face a restless night's sleep I decided to take some Benadryl last night. I had a fairly restless night but nothing terrible. It was today that was the difficult part. I've had a headache and general dry feeling in my head. I realize now that Benadryl affects the cholinergic system in the opposite way that smoking does and maybe this caused some kind of shock? Just wondering if anyone else has had this problem.

Good luck to anyone else who is in their first 5 (or 500) days. Ain't no thang.

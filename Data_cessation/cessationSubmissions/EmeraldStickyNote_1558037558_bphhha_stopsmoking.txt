I always relapse on Day 4. It’s Day 3, and I can feel myself giving in.

It’s happening again. I’m starting to breathe better and have more energy. I do not feel as guilty about hurting my heath because I do not feel as sick. I’m still bored, anxious, and depressed. I want to enjoy myself again, but I do not want to fail.

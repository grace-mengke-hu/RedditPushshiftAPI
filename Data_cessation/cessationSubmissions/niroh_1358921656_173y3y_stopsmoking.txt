blowing off steam 

Hey 

sometimes it gets really hard even though i stopped smoking a month ago according to what i've read in the internet most of the side effects should be disappearing. but the problem is that i am a non-smoker but i don't feel like a non-smoker. I just feel very deprived. 

Quitting wasn't a planned process. I had a surgery and i couldn't smoke so i took it from there. I think that this is a problem because it wasn't my decision in that 1st day to quit.But i also know that it would be much much harder to actually do this if it was that way.

There were and are a lot of times that i think of getting a last smoke. But then when i dream of smoking i wake up so sad that i dreamt that. i really am. and i know that if i break and return to that pack a day i'll disappoint the most important people in my life.

Thanks

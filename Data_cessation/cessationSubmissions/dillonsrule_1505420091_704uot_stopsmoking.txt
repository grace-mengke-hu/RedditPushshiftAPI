Made it through a Bachelor Party!

I have been doing pretty good this time around.  I got much more of that Allen Carr magic moment where I realize how terrible it is and don't want to do it.  The only time I've really struggled a lot recently was when I had a bachelor party to go to.  

Not only were most of my smoker friends there, but even my normally non-smoker friends were smoking to "have fun" that night.  I was literally the only one not smoking.  And we drank a ton!  

Luckily, you can't smoke in bars where I am.  And I avoided going outside with everyone. It was tough, but now I know I'm in good shape.  I made it like 4 months last time until I backslid and smoked at a party.  2 years later, I'm trying again.  This time, I'm feeling good about it!

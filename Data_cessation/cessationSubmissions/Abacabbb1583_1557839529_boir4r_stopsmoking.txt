Almost 24 hours smoke-free: First morning without a cigarette!

Honestly, it wasn't as bad as I remembered it to be.  I (27)  have been a pack-a-day smoker for close to ten years.  Shit, to read that back in my head is gnarly in itself.  The last time I went without a cigarette was summer 2018 for close to 14 days.  Due to a rocky relationship at the time, I slipped right back into my pack-a-day habit.  But now, I'm just looking forward to not feeling like my lungs are going to burst out of my chest after the first 1/4 mile of pushing on a skateboard.  That and saving all of that money!  Damn near $300 a month on these useless sticks.  Any recommendations on stop-smoking apps?  The majority of the screenshots I see posted here look slick!  Thanks in advance, everyone.

Since finally going cold turkey after noncommittal tapering, I've quit, AND MY GIRLFRIEND HAS TOO!

I feel so good after quitting smoking. My girlfriend has quit, and we both smell like roses and awesomeness now, my closet smells better, bike rides are getting easier, and my room mate just hit a week with no smoking too. He said it was harder to smoke being the only one at the house.

I'm so happy about it. I still feel kinda shitty, but my kinda shitty today is way better than my really shitty 3 weeks ago.

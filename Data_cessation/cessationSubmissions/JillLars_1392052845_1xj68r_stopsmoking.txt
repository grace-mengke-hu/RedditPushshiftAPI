Traveling...cravings

So I've been quit for a little over 3 weeks now.  I travel quite frequently for work- and right now, I'm on my first trip since I quit smoking.  I haven't had many issues with cravings until now.  I noticed it when I was booking my trip, I found myself looking for smoking hotel rooms (which I didn't really do often when I did smoke, because they're gross, but still.)  I had to tell myself, oh yeah, I'm not a smoker anymore.  Today, I can't get a flight out until this evening and I'm just killing time, but I find myself really wanting a smoke.  I'm not gonna give in, but just wanted to post to help myself stay accountable.

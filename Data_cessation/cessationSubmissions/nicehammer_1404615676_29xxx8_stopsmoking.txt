Well, i smoked a pack a day for 10 years, I'm 26 now. It was constant ...every 45 minutes i was out smoking. Now that iv quit for so long it has suprised my best friend who smoked about 12 a day, now hes trying to stop. Anyway, keep it up people, woooo!            
Edit: wording. Im drinking. Its not even bothering me woo.

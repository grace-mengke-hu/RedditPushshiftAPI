A unique opportunity and "quit date". Thoughts, suggestions?

I'm 18 years old, and have been smoking under six months.  As someone who is really healthy otherwise, there's always a constant guilt in my head for partaking in this vice.  I try to quit constantly, but I'm always back at it, as all my close friends smoke, and opportunity is everywhere.  I smoke an average of eight cigarettes a day.

Late this summer, I'll be hiking the John Muir Trail, which for anyone who is unfamiliar with the trail, it's about a 220 mile backpacking trip through the California Sierras.  Upon completing this, I'll have two weeks before I start college in a whole new city, with no temptations (like my friends) to draw me back (or so I figure).

My logic is this: for the three weeks I'll be backpacking, not only will I be forced to not smoke, the beauty of America's (arguably) greatest wilderness area will distract me quite well.  After that, I'll muster enough willpower to keep away until I'm off to my university, away from the bad habits I've developed.

Trying to constantly quit has really dragged me down, as I'm normally someone with a lot of willpower.  This seems like a golden opportunity to stay away from cigarettes for good.  Thoughts?

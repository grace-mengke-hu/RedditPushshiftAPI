1 year and 1 day...

Free from tobacco! I honestly thought this would never happen, especially as one of my main reasons for smoking was simply that I *enjoyed* it. I’ll be prouder when I manage to ditch the vape and get off nicotine completely, but it’s a start right?

Keep it up guys, it’s definitely worth it!

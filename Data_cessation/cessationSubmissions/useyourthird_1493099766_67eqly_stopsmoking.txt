Need to stop smoking, but how?

Hey guys, so I'm new here and I really would like to get some advice from you guys. I've been trying to quit now for ages only to fail repeatedly after only hours. It's really becoming a monkey on my back, I've tried everything, read Allen Carrs book like 5 times, bought a vape pen etc etc. I see so many success stories on this sub so please, some advice from y'all would be greatly appreciated.

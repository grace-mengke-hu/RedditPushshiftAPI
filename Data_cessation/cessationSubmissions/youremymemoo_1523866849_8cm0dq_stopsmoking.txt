First off thank you to everyone in this sub. Secondly I want to share the games my brain plays on me while I go through this process-I know I cannot be the only one who has these thoughts!

We all have the moment when enough is enough. And as of today I am 7 days smoke free (OMG OR 8 According to the stopsmoking bot). I have gained so much hope and encouragement from all of your posts and comments. I CANNOT thank you all enough. I waited to post because I wanted enough time under my belt. 

Right now I struggle with the "just one last smoke" trap. I  (feel like) I love love love drinking, smoking, and playing video games. Tonight I am doing all those things without the cigarettes. It's a battle- trying to prove to myself that I can do it. I don't want to be a different person, but it's crazy how smoking becomes part of who you are (I know you get what I am saying). 

The last week has been amazing. No hiding, no guilt, watching those green lines increase in the APP, but there is also the loss of what I feel was part of me. I know that life is better without cigarettes, but I also feel like I want to grieve that part of "who I was." 

Both the video and book from Allen Carr helped me make the decision (although I disagree on some points) to try for real this time. Take what works for you and don't get hung up on what doesn't. I am proud to post here today and can't wait for the rest of my journey. 

Thank you to everyone who reads this, and know that I am there with you in your struggles and no matter what I believe in you &lt;3

i can breathe better, i became better at climbing, i wake up in the morning and my lungs don't hurt, my day has one hour more (no breaks needed), i'm not as tired as i was before - i just love it.

still going strong fellas. four weeks of challenges behind me. i stayed faithful to my future self who will think that current me is a badass.

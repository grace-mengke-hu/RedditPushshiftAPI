Hit the two week-mark today

I'm proud of myself for making it this far. Two weeks! I know that the battle is only begun, but in the past I struggled to make it past 4 days without breaking. That means something changed within me, and hopefully that I'm ready to get rid of this horrible habit once and for all.

And to everyone reading, we can do it! Things really do change so much once you just fight the cravings and let them pass. There is a life on the other side. One recent night I felt like shit and was about to break, I then sat back and meditated, after that had a meal, went to sleep. Next morning I woke up feeling fine, I didn't even think of nicotine until I suddenly remembered later in the day that I was in the process of quitting. Things really can change so much within just a few hours, remember that!

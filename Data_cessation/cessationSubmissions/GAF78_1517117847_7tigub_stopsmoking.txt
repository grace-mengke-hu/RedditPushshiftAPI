Day 7 in the books.

I quit for about 7 months a couple of years ago. I used a vape for a couple of months and then quit that. Then I started back while on vacation, where I was, ironically, dealing with some extremely difficult work problems while my family swam and relaxed. I even had to make a drive back to my city for a day in the middle of the week to deal with things. Anyway I was super stressed. Not a good reason to smoke but I did. A week ago I quit again. I am using nicotine replacement for now. So far things have been fairly easy. Tonight I had a bad craving and almost stopped for a pack but I didn’t. It feels good to have my lungs feel clear, voice not hoarse, not smelling like smoke, and not having to stand out in the cold to get my fix. Anyway this sub helped me last time so I figured I’d come here again.

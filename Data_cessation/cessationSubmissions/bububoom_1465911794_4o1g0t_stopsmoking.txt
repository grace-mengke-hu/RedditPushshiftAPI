Had a big gathering of smokers, 0 thoughts about smokes

On a weekend I've had a big gathering on a weekend with around 20 people. 17 of them smoked and only today I've realised that not even once I had a thought that "maybe i should borrow one to smoke". My friend who quit around the same time as myself, started to smoke immediately. I felt quite disappointed of him but also liberated for myself that I stand strong against my ground.

We spent the whole weekend together and i had no intention to smoke.

Cold turkey going strong for almost 500 days, yay!

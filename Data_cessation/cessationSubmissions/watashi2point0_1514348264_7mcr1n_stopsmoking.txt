It is spreading. Have others around you stopped since you quit?

I've been finding that quite a few friends have given up the habit once they seen me get to about 30 days.   So far 3 close friends have stopped and kept it up for about 2/3 months.   1 of them had a 30 year, 3 pack a day habit.  

Have you found people around you quitting once they see you've been able to stop?

I don't pressure anyone around me to stop and I don't mind if people smoke around me either.  I just thought it was interesting to see it spreading.

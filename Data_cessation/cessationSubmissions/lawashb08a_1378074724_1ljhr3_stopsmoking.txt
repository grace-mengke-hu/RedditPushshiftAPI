I don't know what to do with my hands

Right, i have only ever smoked rolled cigarettes and its become a habit just to roll them, i smoked about a dozen a day and so rolling a cigarette in my downtime became a habit. I'm looking for something to do instead, something to occupy my hands when i'm craving and have nothing else to occupy me. 

Cheers in advance for any suggestions.

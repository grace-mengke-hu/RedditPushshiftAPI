Checking in at 22 days, and feeling a tiny bit stressed today.

Today stressed me out... a lot. I thought this kind of feeling would be gone by now, but then suddenly it just hits me out of nowhere, even at 22 days. I can't even begin to describe the feeling, but it's where I feel restless, unable to relax, and have slight burning sensations... very difficult to describe, but very unpleasant.

I was really worried that I wouldn't last the day, but somehow I'm making it through.

One thing that really keeps me motivated, and keeps me going, is the badge here on this subreddit that I can come back to and look at and feel proud of. I'm thankful that this subreddit exists, because I don't have the greatest support from people in my personal life... people just don't seem to understand, and I can't blame them, because the people in my life honestly have never smoked as long as I have, so I guess I can't expect them to understand...

Anyway, moral support appreciated, today has been rough! Even at 22 days!

CRAZY DREAMS WITH NRT.....ANYONE ELSE??

I have been on Step 1 (21mg) for 24 days now. My dreams are soooo crazy. I have people in my dreams I haven't talked to in years, my husband with his pants down in the mall literally just walking around (so weird but made us laugh) and they are all just so vivid and real! Although it really freaked me out in the beginning, we now wake up to hear all about what my dreams were. I might miss these when they are gone!!! anyone else???

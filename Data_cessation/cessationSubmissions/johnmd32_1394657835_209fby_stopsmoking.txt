Day 4 and a question

Hey all!  First time being serious about quitting in a long time and my first time using an aid.  I'm a 26 year old male whose been smoking on and off (mostly on) for 8 years.  I've been smoking Newports, about 10 a day on average for like the last 4 years.  

I'm Step 1 of the Nicoderm patch and it seems that has 21.5 mgs of Nicotine in it.  A website I checked said Newports have on average .9mgs of nicotine per cigarette.  If I typically had 10 a day that should average out to 9 mgs of nicotine per day.  

Am I doing more harm than good by wearing this patch?  I definitely still get cravings, and don't feel nauseous at all.  Either way I'm going strong and in it for the long haul!

Edit* I just realized I filled in the incorrect year (whoops!) for my badge.  I'm at 4 days, not 733 although I wish it was the latter.  Trying to fix now.

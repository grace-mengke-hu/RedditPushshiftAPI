Im excited!!!

I’ve been wanting to quit for a long time now. On my first try I went 3 days without smoking and then was stupid, smoked one and started smoking again. 
Last Saturday I bought the new IQOS cigarette , it’s heated, no burning trough the process witch supposedly is better. 
Well, on Tuesday I got really sick and couldn’t even smoke because it would give me nausea. Yesterday I wanted to smoke and I tried the IQOS one, made me sick to my stomach, so I (stupid) tried a normal cigarette. I wish  I could just show and tell to every smoker how bad it tasted, it was so awful, like eating burned paper, I couldn’t even stand it. Maybe it’s because of the IQOS, I don’t know... 
So (sorry for the long post), here I am, hoping that this time I can go through with it! I don’t have cravings and when I do, I just remember that smell and that taste and it goes away!!

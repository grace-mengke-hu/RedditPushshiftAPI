5 Days down, first weekend down, some thoughts.

Sitting down today after day 5 (and moving on to day 6) after the first weekend. I used to smoke most when I was alone, and sometimes weekends are lonely times for me because I don't go to work. However, I dealt with it like a champ - fought off 6 cravings on sunday while alone thinking of stressful stuff.

Some other thoughts:

After a funny week when it comes to sleep, my energy levels are better - I am full of energy when I am supposed to be full of energy, and I am tired when I am supposed to be tired. I wake up before my alarm, and I have no trouble falling asleep. 

I've spent the past years in some weird trance where I am always tired! Wow!

An unexpected benefit which I am feeling is that my hair (head and beard) feel fuller. I've never felt this before in my previous quits.

I can't wait to hit 1 week, and start counting weeks as opposed to days.

The past few days have been relatively easy compared to what I was expecting. I now feel a bit stupid for waiting for the new year to quit.

Not another puff, no matter what.
There's no such thing as 1 cigarette.

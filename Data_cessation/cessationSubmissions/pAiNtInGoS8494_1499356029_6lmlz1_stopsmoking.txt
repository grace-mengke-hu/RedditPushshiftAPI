7 Years Smokey

I've been smoking for seven years. The day before yesterday I ran out of cigarettes. I figured it was the perfect time to kick the habit!

 I'd been toying with the idea of quitting for some months, since my mother had a stroke that was largely due to her smoking habits. I wanted to quit for her, so she can see that if I can do it, she can too

The realization that I should really be doing this for myself came a month or two ago, when I wanted to exercise, but being a smoker l, exercising is painful. I was using smoking as a tool for procrastination.

 I found that not smoking yesterday, increased my productivity and my motivation. It allowed me free time to kill with healthy habits, anything from cleaning to working out, to drawing and painting! 

It's funny, because I've been struggling with procrastination for such a long time, I didn't realize that abstaining from smoking could be a useful tool!

Please wish me luck. This is going to be a long, uphill battle.

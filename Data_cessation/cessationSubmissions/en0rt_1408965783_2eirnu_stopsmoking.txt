So I am getting to the end of my 3rd day. Not really as I expected it to be.

This is pretty much the longest I have gone with out a cig in my whole time of smoking. I decided to quit cold turkey 3 days ago (nevermind my badge, I think I set the date wrong) and haven't had a smoke or even had any of my "e-cig". 

See the weird thing is, I have heard stories from friends, college etc etc saying they were murderous and was really craving cigarettes like crazy. Yes I am craving them and there are times where I could just give in or have a lapse in judgement.. but all I have been doing is saying "no" and then move on. I thought this was going to be harder. Will it get harder? Is the first 3 days usually a piece of piss? 

Also, I have been walking around the past 3 days in some kind of euphoric/calm state. I have even been having laughing fits. I was walking in the supermarket after work today and I saw a lady at a "taste testing" stall and I was watching her eat, the whole experience ended with me laughing at it and thinking that this world is a really weird place. 

Am I crazy?

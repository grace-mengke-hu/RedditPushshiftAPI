A little ancillary benefit

So I have a profile on OK Cupid and honestly was going to give up on the site because I had maybe 4 messages sent to me in the past 6 months.  I decided to check today and notice 6 messages in my inbox in the last 24 hours.  I was trying to figure out what the hell changed, and I realized that I changed profile spot for "smokes" from "yes" to "no" yesterday.

I didn't realize it would make that big of a difference on others' perception of me.

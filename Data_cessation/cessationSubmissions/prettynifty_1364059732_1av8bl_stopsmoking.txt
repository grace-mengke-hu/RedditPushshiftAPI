I'm gonna do it. This time for real.

I've quit in the past, but always get hooked again when something stressful comes up or when I get bummed by something. But fuck that shit. Seriously though, remember when you could get in a huge great sigh of air, and when your chest didn't hurt all the time? yeah me neither. Okay. fuck that shit.

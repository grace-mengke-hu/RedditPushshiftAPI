I'm awful to be around since I quit

I've gone through early withdrawal symptoms a couple of times from not being able to smoke and now i'm quitting for good. After about 24 hours I become an awful person everytime. I snap at everyone, I am angry, I can't do my work or any other tasks I set myself and I have zero energy. All in all I'm a person that I really don't want to be. It's hard to feel like that'll pass and easy to think that the cigarettes just made me more chill and productive. Any tips on dealing with that and resisting the urge to smoke to get back my usual self?

While I'm happy I quit, I feel bad about how many times I've failed before. How many failed New Year's resolutions of "this year will be the one I quit." I solemnly promise myself that I will never, ever backslide again. Totally 100% done with cigarettes. Presenting #038 Ninetales. See you tomorrow.

Energy levels after quitting

How great is it to wake up and not feel fatigued and desperately wanting a cigarette first thing in the morning?

When I wake up in the morning I'm now bursting with energy and looking forward to my day ahead (even work!).  When I woke up when I was a smoker it was always "another 5 minutes in bed then I'll get up and have a cigarette". Then I'd always be running late, tired and uninterested. Not anymore!

Nowadays during the day I don't get tired and after working a 9 hour shift I'm still raring to go.  I know this isn't a special feeling as this is how people should feel normally but its a sad realisation of the effects that smoking does to a human body by making it lazy and tired.

Does everyone else have the same feeling since their quit date or am I overthinking/exaggerating?

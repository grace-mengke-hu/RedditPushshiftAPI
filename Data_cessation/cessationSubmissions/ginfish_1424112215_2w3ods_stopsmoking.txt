Losing the habit is making this complicated.

This is attempt #1 at trying to quit and holy shit is the habit fucking with my head.

I stopped last night... It's only been *HOURS* and everytime i think, for exemple, about me going on break @ work and getting something to eat... I keep going to the idea: "...and i'll have time to smoke between the job & the grocery.". Even tho' i know full well i'm supposed to be done, it just keeps going the way of: "And i'll have a cigarette.". 

Been smoking for over half of my life now and it just feels instinctive to have a cigarette when i'm waiting for the bus, etc... gives me a reason to go outside while i'm on break. Stopped hours ago and the habit is already calling out to me like it's as natural as breathing.

Breathing worse after quitting.

Hey guys, new here. I was hoping to get some real advice. I stopped smoking a month ago after a bought of bronchitis with 1 relapse. I noticed that when I don’t smoke I get nighttime wheezing, tight chest, shortness of breath. Coughed up some brown phlegm then it turned clear. However the shortness of breath and night time wheezing persists for maybe 2 weeks. 
I go see my doctor and he immediately gives me asthma medication really strong stuff. No lung test no nothing. 
I’m 23 have no history of asthma and am now in combination inhalers. They make my lungs feel so big like I can’t breathe out :( 

Can someone tell me if shortness of breath is normal after quitting and wheezing and maybe a cough and if so how long? My breathing was better pre smoking. If it helps I was running 10k a week and now I’m scared to step off asthma meds I don’t even know I need 

Any life stories would be appreciated because maybe I should just stop the meds and tough it out so I can heal

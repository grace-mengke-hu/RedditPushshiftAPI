The REAL "Easy Way to Quit Smoking"

Let me start by acknowledging that I'm on a phone right now so I don't know if my flare was ever updated. I have officially quit for 4 months and 18 days. Here's how...

I'm a 24 year old female. I started smoking when I was 12 years old and was a pack a day smoker by 14. I've tried to quit on several occasions. I've been hypnotized, used the patch several times, and most recently attempted vaping. These methods always failed. 

Most recently, I tried Wellbutrin (aka Zyban). I was fed up with trying over and over again and I was about to start working a job that would stop me from smoking for 10 hours a day (which would have been absolutely miserable). I cannot tell enough people... I could shout this from the rooftops.. TRY WELLBUTRIN. I started taking the medicine and after 4 days I quit cold turkey. It is so great to quit initially with absolutely no nicotine replacement and have VERY minimal cravings. Over the past four months I have lost 40 pounds (through clean eating diet and exercise) and quit smoking completely with no cravings. Wellbutrin is a miracle pill. The medicine is a mood stabilizer. The way that doctors think that it works is by leveling the playing field between your "high" of your first two hits and your "low" of the times you want to smoke. 

I also read Allen Carr's book my second day as a non smoker. A lot of the book seems bogus but the main themes are SO important to realize when you're quitting. The thing that sticks out the most to me is the fact that smoking is NOT making you feel better. Smoking is making you feel NORMAL. We are constantly going through withdrawals. The amazing feeling we have when we first hit a cigarette is similar to what a non smoker feels all of the time. 

I have gotten 4 of my friends (and one of my friend's mother) to quit using wellbutrin. I would love to answer any questions you guys have about the nicknamed "happy, horny, skinny pill". It really changed my life.

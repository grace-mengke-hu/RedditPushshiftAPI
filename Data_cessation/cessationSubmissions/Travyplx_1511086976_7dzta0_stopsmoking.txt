I have decided to quit smoking starting this weekend.

The girl that I usually drink and smoke with is on holiday the next couple of weeks. I've decided to use this time to force myself out of the habit. Hopefully when she comes back I can tell her that I have quit smoking and that she should too. Really I am just posting here to solidify my resolve. 2 days down.

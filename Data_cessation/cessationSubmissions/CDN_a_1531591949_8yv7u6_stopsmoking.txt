Can't seem to find the motivation to try again...

It's been several months since my last confession... I'm absolutely CHOKING... dying, coughing... and I just keep smoking... Anyone got an idea.... I did hypnotherapy a while back... it was cool... obviously didn't work, although I feel I learned some things. I Just need a catalyst!

How can I quit smoking?

I've been smoking nearly a pack a day for just under 10 years. I'm 29.

I want to save money, feel better, and just break the habit. But here are my (probably insane) reasons why I don't think I CAN. I think I NEED them in order to keep living, stupid, I know. I'm afraid quitting will make my already existing anxiety go through the roof. I'm afraid I will pass out somehow from quitting.

I used to drink daily for about 5 years, heavily. I gave that up overnight and have been sober for nearly 2 years...I know I have it in me.

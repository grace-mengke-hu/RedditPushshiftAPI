After 9 years I quit

It has now been 16 days since I made the decision to quit smoking. I did tell my doctor and he told me to be aware of triggers and he said that I will most likely be fighting these triggers for the rest of my life. Hearing that kind of made me sad, although I guess it's better to not smoke and feel those triggers than to smoke and get cancer and die.

an unexpected bonus of being an Aussie non-smoker

Is that the amount 'saved' by not spending on smokes escalates pretty rapidly :) 38 days and about $680 saved.
So far I have bought myself a decent pair of walking shoes and some workout gear, a set of top of the range coloured pencils for drawing, and a schmicko funnel.

What have you bought with your new found cash?

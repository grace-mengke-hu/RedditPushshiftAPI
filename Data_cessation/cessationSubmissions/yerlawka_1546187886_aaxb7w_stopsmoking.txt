I will be back here if I crave

Hello everyone
First of all, thanks for the support and motivation of the people who post here.

The first week is over.
Cravings got serious in the evenings. During the day, it is ok not to think about puff.

How do you manage not to smoke if your close frienda smoke? How to manage yourself during hanging outs?
Is it ok if I plan to order shisha in the bars rather than relapsing?

Thanks in advance!

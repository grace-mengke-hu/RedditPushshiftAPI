I stopped smoking but I started again :( HELP!

so I started smoking when I was 17 after an awful breakup.. I just turned 20 today. I am not a chainsmoker anyway.. but I do still smoke.. it started slowly like my pack could last me 2 weeks.. then I think I stopped for a few months ... around 5 months.. then I bought a pack which lasted me a month. so my relationship with cigarettes is fluctuating.. 

somehow I've been stressed with my family and about to start training for work.. and I just moved back to my home country from Canada.. I miss Canada so that's another addition to my stress levels.. but I want to quit and start being clean again because yes it's bad for my health and I realized it gives me acne.. now. before it didn't.. I've been watching my diet and working out a lot but if I can't cut out my smoking then it's gonna be for the worst

it's those times that I only find solace starting my day and after a long day.. with a cigarette :(

P.S. I have been battling acne.. right now it's healing from the worst breakout ever from last year.. but I don't want to add it up wherein the case now is: smoking=culprit for acne

thanks guys.

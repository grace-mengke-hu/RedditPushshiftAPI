Had a dream I smoked

Today is day 55 of not smoking. I can't tell you how many times I've wanted one, but overcame any urges. Last night was weird. Woke up sweating, don't know what I was dreaming. Crazy thunderstorm woke me up at a different time of the night with its loud crackles and bright flashes. Woke up again at an early time, fell back asleep to get my full rest. Now I'm sitting down to have my coffee and remembered I was smoking in a dream last night. I was sitting in a car. It felt like a light cigarette but at the same time it was so damn harsh. I was struggling to take each puff, getting it down. Halfway through the cigarette I was disgusted with myself. I had cheated. Everything I worked up to this point was for nothing. And it wasn't even worth it because I didn't enjoy it like I have been thinking I would. My lesson from the dream? It's not worth it, and if I smoke I would hate it anyway. Such a crazy mind trick this is.

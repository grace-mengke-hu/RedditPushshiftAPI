 Hello to everyone! You should never give up when you are trying to stop smoking.Today I am celebrating 21 days of no smoking!😉
 It’s not impossible to match the best recommendation is to do a sport (tennis, swimming, gym)
 The best recommendation is to go to the gym, it will help you A LOT! I swear!

2 years quit, anxiety question

Hey guys, Ive been quit for 2 years, but unlike all the medical advice, Ive actually found that since then my anxiety levels have increased, even developing into full on panic attacks. Certainly one may not be directly related to the other, but I am curious if anyone else has faced this issue.  Not that I would go back, but I wonder if the temporary "calming" effect of nicotine was enough to temper any underlying anxiety issues, ultimately masking the problem.  Thanks

The good, the bad, and the ugly...

So it's been 2 weeks since I quit. The good thing is I haven't been tempted at all to smoke. I feel confident that I'm never going to pick up a cigarette ever again. The bad thing is I get migraines towards the end of the night, and I'm pretty grumpy all the time. I've even been losing interest in my SO... he's still trying to quit and it infuriates me sometimes... he is still the loving caring boyfriend he was 2 weeks ago. I just don't feel myself anymore. I'm more emotional than I've ever been. I'm saying all of this because I'm usually not such a whiney bitch all the time, I'm usually a really happy person! Where did the old me go?  And when am I going to stop feeling so sad/angry? I used to smoke to handle my stress and now I'm not really sure what do to with myself. I know I sound pathetic... I really need some help.

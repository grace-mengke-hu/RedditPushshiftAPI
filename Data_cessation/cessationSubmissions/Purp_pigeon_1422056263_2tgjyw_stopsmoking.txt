100 !

I don't really post here anymore but I still like to read around occasionally. Today is a special day , it's day 100.
I'v eliminated every trigger .. I identify myself as a 100% non smoker.


It's weird how I view people who smoke now though. I think that theres no way that you can look " cool " while smoking now. What did my young me think ? 


I smoked for 4 years so in 10 years I will be able to say that it was just a phase!

Thanks and good luck guys :)

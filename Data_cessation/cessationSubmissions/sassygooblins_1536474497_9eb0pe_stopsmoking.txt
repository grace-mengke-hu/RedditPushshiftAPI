Finally trying to quit!!

Been smoking pretty heavily for about three years, and I just can’t do it anymore. I used to be an athlete and I go play pickup hockey and can barley skate because of my smokers cough it’s fucking embarrassing. I’ve been lurking on this sub for a few months hoping I’d eventually build up the courage to quit, and I mean really quit because god knows how many times I’ve “quit.” I went out to buy my light blue spirits from the gas station and by the time I finished my second cig of the night I was coughing so hard I nearly threw up. As soon as I got home I flushed all my tobacco, downloaded the quit smoking app and here I am. I’m only 20 years old and it’s sounds like I’m 45 with all the hacking and wheezing throughout my day. I’m so sick of it, hoping for a one and done I’m going cold turkey!! Any advice? Any love and support will be greatly appreciated :)

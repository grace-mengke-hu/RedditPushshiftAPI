Day 6 feeling not so good

Started smoking when I was 14, im 30 now.

 my mate use to pinch cigarettes of his nan and we would skip school and go sit on the local golf course smoking our brains out, extreme cigarette buzz one after the other just lighting up.. then we would make are way home but first we would stop at some lady's garden to rub our hands and school clothing with the lavender plants she had in her garden. Will always remember it. 

Best part of 15 years of havey smoking, now on day 6 cigarette free. Finding it hard not going to lie, irritable, depressed, really messing  my sleep up too now. Oh and my dreams are lucid. Eating loads more food,  have took up jogging to try control my weight gains. Feels strange been sober,  it's almost feels alien to me. Having a clear head feels like I'm on some other substance at some hours of  the day.

Can honestly say this reddit is a help though,  reading others story's,  inspirational it is...

 hoping after a few weeks  I start feeling better in myself and it's just  standard withdraw symptoms I'm experiencing . Day 6 feeling like shit.

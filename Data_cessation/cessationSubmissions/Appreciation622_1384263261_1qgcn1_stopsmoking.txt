One year! What worked for me

I feel like one of the most important things for me was to not make a big deal about my last cigarette, in fact, I did not even know it was my last!  About a month or two before quitting, I decided I would like to have quit by Thanksgiving, so I had a general time frame for myself and about a month to get ready mentally.  Then, one day I noticed I had not had a cigarette in about two hours and just decided "that's it.  I'm done."  I didn't drag out the last cigarette in some big ceremony  I could dwell on that would only make me miss it more, I just didn't smoke again.

Also, I had about a quarter of a pack left when I did this.  This was important to me as well, because I then knew it wasn't my inability to quickly access cigarettes that was preventing me from smoking, but my own sheer force of will!  I could pick one up, hold it, and say "I'm not going to smoke you."  That definitely helped, knowing it was my will to resist that was allowing me to quit.

I still would like a cigarette from time to time, and still miss it, because lets face it, we all loved doing it, but for those just quitting, don't worry -- the way you feel that first week will NOT be the rest of your life!  And when it comes to alcohol, as surprising as it sounds, I never even think about cigarettes when I'm drunk now!  It gets better, stay strong!

Edit: Also, I did not tell anyone for about a week.  This was mostly out of fear of failure and having other people then know I failed.  But I feel it also helped with that first week to make it a personal journey, and to not have so much pressure from those around me.

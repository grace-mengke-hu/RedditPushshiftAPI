2 years

2 years, 730 days, roughly 14600 cigarettes I didn't smoke.

I smoked a pack a day, sometimes more, for 15 years. 
I was going through a rather bad phase in my life 2 years ago and out of the blue decided I would stop smoking. There were no gimmicks, no tricks, no substitutes, nothing but simply throwing out all my cigarettes, having a last one and deciding to end it there.
First month was hard, not physically but mentally, I kept thinking about smoking, wanting to cave in and have a smoke, noticing every person smoking, having hard cravings early morning and before going to bed at night, all day, every day. 
And then, slowly, the cravings started weaning out and becoming less common until they went away completely.
Now, if you are going through the motions or about to begin your smoke free journey and you need to talk, drop me a line, I'll happily help you out in any way I can, but remember, it's not hard, you only THINK it's hard and your MIND rules your body. If you truly WANT to you will do it.

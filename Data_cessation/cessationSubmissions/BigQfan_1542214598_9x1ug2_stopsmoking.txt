I think I made it a year

I’m pretty sure I completed a year now, I’m just posting here because it used to keep track of the days.
Anyway, I broke down one night and fired up and took three drags but I stopped myself and decided I could NOT go back to it. I put it out and haven’t fallen again since. 
All of you starting this journey, I never thought I could do it, i smoked for 32 years, but look at me now!
And yeah, it’s still hard, I still have triggers, but I’ve just come too damn far

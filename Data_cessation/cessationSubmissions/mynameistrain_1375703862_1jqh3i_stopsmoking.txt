Fuck Yeah

Howdy guys & gals.

Just popping in to say that all this, is possible. Giving up smoking is entirely within the realms of possibility for you.

When I first stopped smoking, I initially only wanted to take a break, maybe save a bit of cash along the way. Now here I am, 501 days in, fully realizing how capable we all are of beating this.

When I'm around people smoking, it doesn't bother me. I don't mind people smoking near me because it keeps my willpower in check; I occasionally have to remind myself why I gave up in the first place. 

Of course, being stuck in a car with everybody else smoking isn't pleasant. The overwhelming stink of the smoke brings on mini-headaches, almost makes you feel nauseous. But this only serves to remind you how harmful it can be to your body.

Keep your hands occupied: Mess around on your phone, start typing long stories, do anything to keep your hands busy.

Chew gum. Chew lots of gum. I can't stress enough just how helpful it is.

Take it one day at a time people; If you can give it up for 3 days, you can give it up for 4. If you can give it up for 4 days, you can give it up for 5. Keep it up and you realize that you're 4 weeks in, and it's all easy from there.

Good luck folks. It's hard at first, but it's definitely possible. Keep up with the great community here and you'll be giving yourself an incredible advantage. It's worth it in the end.

Why is it so hard for you all?

English is not my native language so please have that in mind.

Jesus guys, i never seen so much complaining in my entire life! People are literally complaining on the first 12 hours and how hard it is. I think most of you need a harder aproach if you wanna make it. 

People around me including me (I'm not a tough person) had almost no trouble stopping smoking, and you know why? Because instead of constant whining and complaining you just have to swallow it and be a fucking man for once. 

Anyways i smoked for 12 years  3 packs a day(not lying). I quit cold turkey and it wasn't hard AT ALL! 

You see, instead of craving and lying in bed all day and complaining i went outside, and i just took deep breaths with a smile on my face thinking "It's so fucking beautiful being a non smoker".... and it really is! I never felt better in my life and i do know that i will never touch smokes again. I am now 2 years sober.

tl;dr quit being a little bitch you are and be happy because you are a NON smoker now!

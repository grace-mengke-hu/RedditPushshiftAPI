Just smoked my last cigarette.

I'm done. From now on, I'm a non smoker. I've tried every method out there, e cigs, vapes, patches, gum, "cutting down". The only thing I've never tried (for more than a few hours, at least) is just plain stopping. So here I go! 

I've spent all day chain smoking and reading "easy way". It's helped a bit, but I'm still nervous. I know some book isn't going to magically make my cravings go away. But I can do it! Time to take my life back!!

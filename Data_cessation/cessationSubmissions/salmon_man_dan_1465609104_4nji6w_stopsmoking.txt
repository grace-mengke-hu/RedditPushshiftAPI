Unhealthy habits okay to use to quit smoking?

I've been quitting smoking steadily for about two months now. I went from a half pack or more a day to 3 or 4 a day immediately and held that pace for like 6 weeks. Last week I made a break through and got down to 0, 1, or 2 a day every day since last Tuesday. I'm on day two in a row and the third out of four without smoking at all.

However, I'm relying heavily on junk food (chocolate, candy, potato chips, soda, etc.). I have no idea why this helps so much but it definitely has. I was wondering what you guys think? Am I just switching out one problem for another, is this unsustainable? I've never struggled with junk food in the past, so in my mind I can use it as a crutch to quit smoking, and then when the nicotine cravings are gone dumping junk food will be easy.

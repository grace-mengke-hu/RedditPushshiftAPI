Ok day 12 of no cigarettes and I had a question.

I'm currently on my 12th day without a cigarette and I'm doing great honestly.  My fear, however, is that I also haven't been drinking either.  I didn't do this because I had a problem, but because it is a really big trigger for me.  

Does anyone have tips for how to deal with this?

So, you want to quit smoking?

Hey guys, just thought I'd share an article I wrote about quitting smoking via vaping: [https://thevapereview.ca/so-you-want-to-quit-smoking/](https://thevapereview.ca/so-you-want-to-quit-smoking/)

I was a 20+ year smoker and wasn't able to quit no matter what I tried - because at the end of the day, I enjoyed it too much. But when I found electronic cigarettes was when I was able to quit - by replacing smoking with something much more enjoyable (for me).

Since then, I've been an advocate of vaping as cessation aid - and have tried to help as many people quit as possible by buying them their first vape kits, eliquid, and answering any questions they may have. 

If you're considering vaping as your means to quit smoking - feel free to ask any questions!

Cheers:

Weird day.

This is my third day quitting. For some reason I've relapsed every evening and I smoke one or two before going to bed. During the days I suck on lozenges.

Today is a bit different. I realized around 5pm that I haven't had any nicotine whatsoever today and I don't feel like having any either. I don't have cravings either, it's more like a thought that I can easily push off.

Other than that I'm dealing with the normal withdrawal stuff. I'm lightheaded, breathing feels weird (oxygen happens). I have weird flu like symptoms too.

Yeah, I just felt bored and wanted to share this.

How Many Day 1’s Do I Need?

So...day one again. I’ve tried multiple times to quit with limited success here and there (think a week, two weeks, month), but never anything permanent. I have two smokes left in my pack, which will be gone by noon, and I feel like it’s a perfect time for me to cash out. Just to walk away from the table with the time I have left.

No more excuses, no more “well we’re having a party this weekend so I’ll start Monday”, my time is now. I’m going to beat this for my wife, my kids and myself. Let’s fucking do this.

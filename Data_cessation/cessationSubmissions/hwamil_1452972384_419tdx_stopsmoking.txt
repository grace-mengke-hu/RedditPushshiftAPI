Smoking doesn't give you personality

Going to be honest and say that I think smoking looks cool, even though I have quit. A lot of us don't like to admit that that's a big reason how we all get started, but that's beside the point.

I work on tv/film sets and smoked a lot during the jobs. I was always self conscious about how I looked while I smoked, not because I was ashamed but I wanted to appear fashionable with them.

So we are working on a shoot for 14 hours... And not one person has noticed that I haven't had a cigarette between my fingers the entire day. That's how much little it matters to other people, I realized.

So if you have a part of yourself saying 'but this is who I am and smoking is somewhat important to the way others perceive me', it really isn't.

This anecdote is probably not very relatable to many of you but I thought it was an interesting observation that is worth sharing.

Well, I see tons of smartphone apps to help me quit smoking, but I don't see any websites. I work in a place where I can't have a cell phone, but I've got free reign to browse. Any ideas?

Ideally, something that is interactive to a degree - like apps.  Everything is app app app, no damn websites, and I'm already in a crabby mood and frustrated.

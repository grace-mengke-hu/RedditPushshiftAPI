Not trying to start a debate or argument here, but...

... is there a better sub than this one that discusses quitting, tips, how-tos, advice, etc? This sub seems like it's 90% people congratulating themselves and others who have already quit, and less a sub (as per the description) dedicated to helping people quit.

I mean, I'm happy for you all, but listening to people who have already succeeded is like salt in an open wound. It doesn't help, nor inspire me. It only conjures negative feelings of envy, jealousy, etc.

Anyone else feel this way?

(Now please be kind and not trolly in your replies)

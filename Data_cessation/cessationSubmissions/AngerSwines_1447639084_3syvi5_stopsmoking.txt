Wow. That went by fast.

One year, boys and girls. A year ago I thought  about smoking every few minutes. Then, it was hours, days, weeks, and almost not at all. 
To anyone thinking about quitting, do it. I had the luxury of going to my cabin for days three through seven, in order to not be a dick to everyone near me. The physical stuff like restless legs at night and the occasional headache were easy compared to the mind fuck that smoking for 29 years leaves you with. Thanks for reading and especially, writing your experiences. They have helped.

Finished project.. having a bit of a craving...

I've been working 12- 16 hour days on some projects at home and today... now I have finished a major part of it. Having some craving ... my mind telling me I want a "victory smoke"...lol?? Not going to cave but I don't like the feeling. I've been so busy in fact I haven't had time to post here ... so I'm doing this instead of smoking...Oh yeah... and as I was going in the frig I see I have 1 cold beer in there... man did I feel like cracking that... but again/... can't do it... 2 sips and I'll be at the corner store. Oh well in 6 months or a year maybe! I gave away a bottle of wine because I didn't want the temptation! So... that's my day! Hope you're all doing well!!!

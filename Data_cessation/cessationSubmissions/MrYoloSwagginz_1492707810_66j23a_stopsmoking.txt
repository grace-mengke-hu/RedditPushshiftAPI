Somewhat i feel a victory for today!

Long story short, started a new job working on site today and all of the people i was working with except 1 other smoked. I had numerous chances to have a cigarette but i stayed strong and refused.

I also went the whole day without NRT just normal fruit flavoured gum! 

It's something i am proud of and i also realised how many times these people had a cigarette at any given chance, i used to be the same! Hopefully after this step today, i can stay on track!

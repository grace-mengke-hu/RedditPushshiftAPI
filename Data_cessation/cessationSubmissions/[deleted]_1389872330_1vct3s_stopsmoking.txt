Is this addiction?

The compulsions are becoming more frequent. When they come, I cannot deny them. I have to drop everything to satisfy it. I get excited. Like the feeling I used to have when I'd get a new video game when I was a kid: I couldn't wait to get home and throw it in. I'd fantasize about it all the way up until the second I began actually playing.

The compulsion could come from anywhere. A thought, something I read on AskReddit, anything. As soon as my brain finds a commonality between what it's processing and the compulsion, my focus immediately derails, and the compulsion must immediately be satisfied. I have to drop everything then and there. I *want* to drop everything then and there.

So is this what it's like? Have I developed an unhealthy compulsion?

If so, can you help me break it?

Today was the first day I realized how dumb smoking actually is. I don't need it.

Woke up with some Mucus, but it could just be the changing of seasons.  Getting ready for work I realized there was never a reason I needed to smoke cigarettes.

I've also been Facebook free for a week today.  Coffee free since Monday.  And brought my lunch to work all week to save money.

I want to get in shape to start playing hockey again, the league starts in May but I need to start getting in shape ASAP.

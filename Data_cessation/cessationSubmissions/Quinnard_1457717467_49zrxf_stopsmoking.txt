The dreams stopped!

So I'm two weeks into my quit, and every night I've had dreams where I am smoking heavily. It's not the main point of the dream, but before my quit I had never dreamt of cigarettes. Anyway, last night the dreams stopped. 

Has anyone else had a similar experience with dreaming during the quit?

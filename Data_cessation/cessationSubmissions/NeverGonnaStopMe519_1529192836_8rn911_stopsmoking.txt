I was happier when I was smoking?

I look back on how stressful life has been the last 9 months (not due to cigarettes, just a lot happening in life). And in those 9 months, Ive been quitting for a few months then relapsing.

I remember back to before then, I smoked unapologetically and was much happier. It makes me want to smoke again and quit when my life is more in order.

Can anyone relate?

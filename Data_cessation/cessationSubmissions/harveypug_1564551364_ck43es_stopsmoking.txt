Just hit my 4th day! NRT and CBD are helping!

So the first two days I was using high dose NRT. Because I was vaping nic salts all day, every day, withdrawal was still a MASSIVE BITCH. I then looked up studies on CBD and how it can help curb nicotine withdrawal. Since I have the pills on hand, I popped one. Within an hour, the immense psychological pain had reduced by tenfold. It's still there, but alot of the edge is gone. It's so relieving!

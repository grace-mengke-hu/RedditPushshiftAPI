Patches, itchy skin

Hi, Desperate to quit but wanting to use patches (other methods just don't do it for me) the last 2 brands I tried (Nicoderm and Habitrol) both cause maddening itches

I know in the past I have used a patch (no idea of the brand) that didn't have that issue and worked pretty good.

Wondering if anyone else has come across this and maybe found a way around it?

Thanks in advance for any responses! :)

Hungry or Angry?

I'm on my third day and mostly all is well. However, I keep having spurts of having a seething rage. I know my mind an emotions are playing tricks on me. Fortunately, I'm able to catch myself pretty quickly from blowing up or seething in angry. I've had a few times today where I knew I was burning a hole in my dog's head staring at her when she licks herself a few minutes too long. But again, I'm still able to catch myself in those moments which I'm grateful to know I'm still in control. 

My question from other quitters; is the extreme anger from using smoking as a crutch to self\-soothe from past instances of anger or is it related to being hungry and blood sugar levels?

Drop what you're doing and RUN

21 YO from Chicago here.

Three weeks smoke free (by far my longest quit) and running has been my savior. Better than any kind of NRT. The NATURAL high you get after just five minutes of running is 10 times more awesome than the fake and cruel nicotine high you get from smoking AND it will last you the rest of the day. Also, your body fucking will fucking love you for it, too.

Doesn't matter where you run to or how fast you are. Download a free running app (lots of good ones) to track your progress and share on social media (who knows, you could start a kick-ass smoke-free running club; make a dopamine-inducing playlist, and fucking RUN.

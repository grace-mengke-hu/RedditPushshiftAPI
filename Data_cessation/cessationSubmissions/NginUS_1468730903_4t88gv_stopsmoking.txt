Still struggling with cravings on day 17...

Hi,

I quit on the 1st of the month, partly so that it would be easier to keep track of how long I have without. Every couple days my cravings get to be quite powerful & I think I want to give up & have a smoke. I know in my heart it's in my best interest to stay stopped, & that I'd ultimately regret it if I were to relapse. These ideas have been effective help to not give in so far, but I worry about my resolve not being strong enough one day & that I'd eventually fail even after making it this far. Last time I quit I made it 45 days before I gave in to the craving. For some reason they don't seem to get much better after a period of time. I have 1 patch left, & tell myself I'm saving it for when the cravings are particularly bad, so I'm afraid of using it in case maybe afterward I'd need it more than I did when I used it. I should probably just give in & put it on & get some lozenges for future cravings- they're how I quit for months last time I was successful at stopping. I used the lozenges a month or so ago when I tried quitting another time, & they didn't seem to help much, I think because I was still smoking while using them. Felt no relief when I had one. I figure I've been without any nicotine for so long this time that I'd probably feel the lozenges this time if I were to try them. Could use some support here. I have a pdf of Alan Carr's 'Easy Way', but haven't sat down to really read it through. I tried once & it sounded like an infomercial so I didn't finish it. Is there a video of it somewhere maybe?? Any feedback/support is appreciated. TYIA

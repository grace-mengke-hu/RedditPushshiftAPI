If Allen Carr's book didn't work for you...(and you need some tough motivation)


You're not a special butterfly, you're simply the odd man out. There's no excuse you can give yourself to not quit. I quit December 20'th after having read the book multiple times expecting my quitting to be easy because isn't that what his book says? It wasn't. I got the book, I damn near devoured it. I even read it three times just to be sure! However, it wasnt easy and I felt betrayed. I also felt anger at not only the book but at myself. I felt as though I was lied to and that I had personally failed for having withdrawal symptoms. The book clearly stated that having withdrawal meant I merely didnt grasp the concept so I read it again and again to help me get through my first week. It did nothing to settle the fire I had within me. Going on Willpower is daunting and a terrifying thought to the newly nicotine free but I can promise you this, every single day is better than the day before! Quitting isn't easy for some despite the book; it's damn difficult. You know what else has been difficult for me? Anything worth having. Being a non-smoker is no exception! How much do you love smoking? Do you love it enough to give up everything for? Do you have goals you want to achieve? Please, tell me how that puff brings you closer to them! No, you have a crutch because you're scared. Life's dealt you a bad hand recently or has been dealing you the same hand for a while. That cig is YOUR moment of peace. Your moment of peace that's draining your life and enslaving you the status of "Nicotines Bitch". You're better than that and you know it. Quittings hard but so is life and you've toppled that bitch like a fucking boss, haven't you? Quit making excuses, they're weak but you aren't. Quittings hard, if it wasnt it wouldn't fucking be worth it you pussy.

Day 3. Absolute horror.

I know that withdrawal-wise it's the hardest day, but I'm literally dying. I'm sweaty, nauseous, woke up with every muscle in my body hurting. Eating a ton of chewing gum but it ain't making things easier.

For those who quit, how did you cope with days like this? Any thoughts/mantras that helped?

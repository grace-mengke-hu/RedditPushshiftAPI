Creativity and Productivity vs Cigarettes

I stopped smoking almost 3 weeks ago (after smoking a pack a day for 4 years); I have read Allen Carr's *Easyway* and everything went smoother than I expected. I got cigarette cravings for a while (I still get them from time to time) but I am quite happy with being a non-smoker now. 

However, my biggest challenge at the moment is to focus on a specific task, immerse myself into something that I enjoy and be productive for long period of times. When I was smoking, I could work one hour straight, then go for a cigarette and repeat the process for at least 4 hours (until I was getting mentally exhausted). Now, I can't immerse myself into anything (other than playing video games). Whenever I want to start creating something (I work as a digital designer), I find reasons to be *unhappy* \- not feeling inspired enough, not finding the perfect Spotify playlist, not having a tidy desk, etc). I didn't have these issues before and during the past two days I have been giving it some thought. Allen Carr's didn't mention any advantage related to smoking, but for some reason I think I was more productive and creative while smoking (it was a part of my creative process for a couple of years). Overall, I feel like I get irritated when I encounter a challenge, instead of being motivated to solve the problem. 

Is there something that Allen Carr chose not to mention in regards to the chemicals the nicotine releases in the brain and their effect on productivity/creativity? Is it just the habit of smoking while working that I can't get rid of easily? Anybody working in any creative industry that might offer some insight into a similar issue?

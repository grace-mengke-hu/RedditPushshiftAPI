Dreams and Stomach Problems

I keep having dreams where I'm smoking and it's driving me CRAZY. I'm 17 days and 23 hours in (almost to 18, whoop!!) so I know it's just my brain's way of being an asshole but damn. Anyone else experience this? 

I'm also having a lot of stomach problems and I think it's because I'm eating/snacking waaaayy more than I was when I was smoking. Any suggestions to help with the constant urge to snack?

60-odd hours cigarette-free. I'm already feeling a lot better

I'm able to breathe without any pain, and no more nasty coughing. 

I was smoking 8-10 cigs a day for the past 10 years, so not as bad as a lot of people, but still a not-so-great habit. 

Hopefully I can keep it up and continue to deal with the cravings. If you're on the fence about quitting, know that the feeling of clear lungs is better than any dart you'll ever have. Good luck to everyone!

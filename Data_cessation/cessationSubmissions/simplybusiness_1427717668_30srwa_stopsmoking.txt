On the cusp of my 23rd birthday I reach 150days/5months smoke free after 6 years.

I have smoked for a little over 6 years now, after numerous failed attempts over the years, Just 2 days before my 23rd birthday I just reached 150 days smoke free.

 Having saved myself hundreds of euros, not smoked 2099 cigarettes and added 8 days and 18 hours to my life I feel great. 

Thanks to everybody on this sub for their encouragement and I wish ye all the best with your struggle. If I can do it ye all can too. Every failed attempt is just one step closer to success.

New around here

I smoked for about 26 years, basically since I was a senior in high school.  On November 21 of 2014 I quit and have been doing pretty well since then.  I will say that this is the 4th time I've tried to quit, but the first time I've done it because I wanted to do it for me.  Looking forward to visiting this forum and getting to as many days as some of the others around here.

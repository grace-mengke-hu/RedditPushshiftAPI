Holy shit smoking smells awful when you quit

I'm 20 years old and a cigar per day smoker for the past year or so. I know it doesn't sound like much but that's about a pack of cigs a day worth of nicotine and a hell of a lot of money. 

I'm proud to say I'm 7 days clean! I was with my dad in our office today and he had a cigar, holy shit they have a completely different smell when you stop smoking. I'm sitting here with a pounding headache trying not to breath too much. They smell awful and when I was smoking they smelled great. It's a crazy thing I just noticed

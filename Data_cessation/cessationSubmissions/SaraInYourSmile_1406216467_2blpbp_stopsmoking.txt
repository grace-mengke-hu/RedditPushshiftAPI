I'm not really feeling better yet, what's going on?!

I'm on Day 18 without cigarettes, and Day 6 without nicotene.  I haven't used my eCig in 3 days.  My lungs still don't feel much better, I'm still stuffy, and don't feel like I'm really gaining back my sense of taste or smell yet.  I've been working out (not too much, just about 15 minutes a day), and trying to eat healthier, but I'm gaining a lot of weight  (about 5 pounds).

I know results differ amongst individuals, but are any of you having (or did any of you have) the same experience? How long did it take you to start seeing palpable results (such as return of smell and taste)?

Just for the record, I'm never going back to smoking, and I'm not getting down on myself, I'm just a little discouraged at my lack of results!

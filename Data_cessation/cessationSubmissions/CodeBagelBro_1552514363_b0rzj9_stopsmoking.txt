How do I quit? (If this isn't allowed here, I'll delete it)

For the past 3 or 4 years, I've been smoking. It started when I lost my grandma. She passed away just out of nowhere. I couldn't handle losing someone who has ment the most to me for a majority of my life in this Earth and I didn't want to forget her. She had been smoking for a long time before she passed, so I thought the best way to remember her was to smoke. Now, it's become a habit/addiction and I don't know how to stop. 

If anyone has advice, I'd greatly appreciate it.

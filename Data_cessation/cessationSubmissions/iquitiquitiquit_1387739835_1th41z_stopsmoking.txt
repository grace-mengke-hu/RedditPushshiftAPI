Over 6 months! (195 Days Strong) - Observations and Encouragement

Hey all -

So its been over 6 months since I quit smoking cold turkey. Just wanted to check in with all of you and let you know that 1) its totally worth it to go through the pain and suffering to achieve smoke-free status, and 2) there are some side-effects to watch out for after you quit.

On the side effects - my first post outlined the usual intense appetite, skin issues, insomnia, etc from quitting. However, a couple of other things you all should look out for...

1) It exacerbated some underlying anxiety/depression issues I was in denial about. The cigarettes definitely served to soothe alot of messed up shit. I don't know how to explain this other than at about 2-3 months in, it felt like a got smacked in the face with reality. 

2) Water retention. I retain water extremely easily now, for some odd reason.

3) You will almost gag when around other smokers. Most of my close friends are still smokers, and when I had a few over at my place, I could smell the smoke on them from across the room...and it was gross haha

Anyways, those are my observations thus far...best of luck to all who are in the middle of this battle!

20 days free after 46 years of smoking--if I can do it, anyone can!

between Chantix, Allen Carr's book, you good people and Wasa crispbread, I have managed to not pick up a cigarette for 20 days! I never before even considered quitting. I never thought that I could last more than half a day. And now look! I feel like Wonder Woman--I had smoked since I was a kid. I never before knew what it is like to be smoke free as an adult. I could not have done this without all of you. We are rock stars!

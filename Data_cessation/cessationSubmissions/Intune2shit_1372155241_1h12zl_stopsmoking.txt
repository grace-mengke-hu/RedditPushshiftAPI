Allen Carr webcast?

Hi Guys, I'm still going strong on my second quit and was able to do it using whyquit.com and being stubborn with myself. 

My sister on the other hand has smoked through 5 pregnancies and tells me she would like to quit but just cannot. She says the anxiety and panic attacks are too much for her to handle. She is a smart lady and quit a fan of logic but smoking always wins over logic for her. 

I just found out about Allen Carr and am wondering if the Webcast would help her? It seems to claim that it can remove all anxiety and panic from the quitting process. Does it really work? I care deeply about her and her children and know the pain she went through when our father died from lung cancer. I don't want her kids to go through the same.

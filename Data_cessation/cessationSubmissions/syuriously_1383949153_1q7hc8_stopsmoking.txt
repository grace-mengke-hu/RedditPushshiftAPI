Memory Tumors. What is your most sentimental smoking memory and why is it so?

I am always amazed at how many enjoyable memories I have find a way of being attached to smoking and always come to mind whenever I crave a smoke. For example:

Christmas time around family and friends 

Friday afternoon drinks after a long work week

A weekend meet up with a friend at a cafe

The cigarette after an amazing concert


So I ask what Is your most sentimental smoking memory and why is it so?

How important was defining these "Mental Tumors" and destroying those links in your mind to overcoming smoking?

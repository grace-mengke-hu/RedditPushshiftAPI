6 days ... i feel good but...

There is one thing that scares me, is a feelling inside me that sais i wont enjoy a lot of things whithout a cigar ... I hate that feelling , but every time im having a beer i think about puffs... this will sound stupid but i feel that im losing something great ...i should think that im winning lifetime....

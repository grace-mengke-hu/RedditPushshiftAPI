Smoked for 27 years

So I smoked for 27 years with exception of pregnancy. DH did too. Last Wednesday we both quit. I was quiet, went for a run, listened to music. He completely went psycho blaming me for everything in his life, saying he hates our 20 years together, screaming at me etc I started crying like a crazy and yes went out to buy a pack. Now this jerk hasn't smoked for a few days, took it all on us, and all I can do is be terrified of quitting myself! Not smoking and having him rage like that made me cry and I never cry! I want to quit so bad but I'm afraid of losing control and my cool. And oh my gosh, the bouts of crying! Holy shit, like as if my dog died, it felt like literally something was dying. Help, has anybody experienced that with their SO or yourself?

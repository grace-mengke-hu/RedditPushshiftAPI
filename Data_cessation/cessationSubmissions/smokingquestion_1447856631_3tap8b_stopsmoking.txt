Would my 16 year old body fully recuperate from ending my family's smoking habits?

My parents have smoked many years before I was born, and have continued to after the sixteen years of my life so far. My only guess is that my mother probably smoked while she was still pregnant with me. What’s worse is that my older brother started smoking when I was around 7-10, I believe, and now he’s living in my home with his wife, who also smokes. I hate that they smoke, and I hate that I know there has been damage done to my physical and mental health because I live with them. I also hate that they’re destroying their bodies with this habit, and I want them, myself, and every other nonsmoker living with us to maintain as healthily of lives as we can. My question is, assuming I could get them all off smoking after one year, would my body be able to fully recuperate from the secondhand smoke with time?

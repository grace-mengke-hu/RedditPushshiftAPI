Separating smoking from my identity?

I've been smoking since I was 14 and I'm 21 so 7 years. I'm on day 5. The last few months I've been going in and out, 2 weeks on, 2 weeks off, 2 weeks seems to be my breaking point. One of the hardest things for me is separating smoking from my identity...to me the image of smoking a cigarette is romantic and cool...like in the movies...I know it sounds stupid. But I find it hard to think about certain things without imagining myself smoking a cig while doing it. For instance when I'm up late writing, or after a show( I'm a musician), or on a road trip. Because of this it's easier for me to tell myself "I won't smoke for 1 year" than it is to tell myself "I'll never smoke again." But I feel like that's a dangerous way to think. It's like breaking up with cigarettes and in my heart I'm having trouble letting them go...any advice?

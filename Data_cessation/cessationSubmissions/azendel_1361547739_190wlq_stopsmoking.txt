Does nicorette prevent or delay some of the health benefits from quitting? 

I'm taking nicorette, and I'm just wondering if it has an effect on the improvement of my health as a result of quitting. No doubt nicotine is bad for my heart and cardio system, but will nicorette prevent me from feeling healthier in the short term as cold turkey does?

I don't even think about it anymore

The only time I ever get tempted or concerned are when I've heard some serious bad news or my friends spark up around me but even then its just an 'eh, I'll get over it'.

Quitting noobs. It gets easier. Trust me. (Quit once before, failed after 9 months, went back, forgot how easy it gets when you stop)

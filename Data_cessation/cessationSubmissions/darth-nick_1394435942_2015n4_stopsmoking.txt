E-cigs. Yea or nay?

I've started using an e-cig in place of real cigarettes. I haven't had a real cigarette or cigar for 3 and a half weeks. I was smoking a pack to a pack and a half a day. I don't have any real cravings anymore. I realize that using an e cig is still worse than not smoking anything so i'm trying toquit using it as well. How many of you guys have used one as a stepping stone to quitting altogether?

Seeking some help!

Hey guys and girls! I'm new to this sub and I was wondering if I could get some advice from anyone! So a little background to my smoking history, it started off when I was 17, I decided to light a cigarette when I was drunk and that's when it all came down on me, I started smoking almost half a pack a day and it was brutal, I've managed to cut it down to a couple sober cigarettes a month but that isnt the problem, it's mostly when I drink! Everytime I have a beer, I crave a smoke and then I chainsmoke the whole night and I feel so guilty the morning after, does anyone have any advice to kick the craving when it comes to drinking? Thanks so much everyone!

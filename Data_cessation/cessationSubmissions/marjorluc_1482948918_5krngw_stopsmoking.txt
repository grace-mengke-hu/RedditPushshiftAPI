5 days without smoking

Hello fellow stoppers. I am Marjanne from the netherlands so please forgive my sometimes bad spelling. 
For the second time this year i have quit smoking. First time i managed 2 and a half month.  Now i have 5 days already and am happy i had to quit. Its for an operation on my shoulder. I smoked for 36 years about 35 sigarets a day and i am afraid i end up in a wheelchair with oxigen. I hope i will realise that before i ever want to start again. 
Need all the help i can get

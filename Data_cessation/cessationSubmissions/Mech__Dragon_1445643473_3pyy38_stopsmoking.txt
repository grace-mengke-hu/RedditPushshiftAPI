Day 3. I haven't felt this good in a long time.

Great day so far. I haven't felt this good in a long time. Woke up wide awake at 6:05, without any mind fog. With one trigger hitting on the way to work, and another right after lunch, I'd say today was pretty successful.

I'll probably cut back on posting to r/stop smoking for the next couple of days. I feel as though a great weight has been lifted, and just by posting here I have found an extra bit of determination to succeed.

Here's to healthy futures, and jars full of cash.

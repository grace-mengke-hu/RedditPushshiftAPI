Allen Carr's books

I'm doing a free trial of the Scribd app (unlimited books and audiobooks) and happened to search Allen Carr after hearing about him on this sub. All of his books are available. I'm so excited to start reading! Just thought I'd give a heads up to anyone be else who may be thinking of reading the books but was like me and didn't go buy it at the bookstore. Yippie- I'm about to be a non smoker!

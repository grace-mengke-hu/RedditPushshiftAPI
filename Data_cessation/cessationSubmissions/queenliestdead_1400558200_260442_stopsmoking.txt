How do I even begin to quit??

I haven't been smoking for very long at all (I'm almost 21 and started when I was around 16), but I want to stop before it gets too late. I can already feel the toll its taken on my body. I first said I wanted to quit 2 years and having been talking about quitting off and on up until now. I just cant seem to bring myself to do it though. I always tell myself I'll get one more pack and then quit but you know how that goes.  I'm nervous to quit because 1) I use it as a de-stresser and I get upset and stressed out about a lot of things and 2) because I like to use it I'm situations where I feel anxious/socially uncomfortable(driving in the car/around new people). And of course because its habit too I guess. Any redditors have any suggestions on how to finally put my foot down against myself? And thoughts on whether cold turkey or a gradual decrease is the best method??

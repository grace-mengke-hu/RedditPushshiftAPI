Young person having quitting problems.

Hey, Im 16 and trying to stop after 2 years. I have been told that the e-cigs are very good and all the other nicotine related products are highly rated too. But im only 16 and my local store wont sell me the e-cigs because im under age, and believe me its a lot easier to ask your budddies (who are old enough, and also smoke) to buy you fags, than to ask them to buy you quitting products. So I ask, are there any other ways rather than nicotine products that you guys feel are effective at making you quit?

Feeling Defeated

I told myself today was the day. I bought the patches. I downloaded the smoke free app, I psyched myself up. I had my last one at noon, waited until I had a craving, and put a patch on. The second I did all I could think about was smoking. I would fight it, but it would come back 10 minutes later. I panicked and bought a pack after work, took off the patch and smoked one and I feel awful about it but I just don't know how to quit. I want to; I REALLY want to. But the second I tell myself I just had my last cigarette all of a sudden I NEED them. I just don't know what to do anymore :(.

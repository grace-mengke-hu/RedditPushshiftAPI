A month long quitter, A look back. A non smoking-nostalgia.

Smoker me:
5 low tar cigarettes a day, for five years. 2.5 pack years in smokers terms. Being a student, living in a hostel, those cigarettes costed me 33 percent of my allowance. Another 33 percent for buying cigarettes to a fellow smoker, coffees and sodas that came with it. Yeah I was whom the quitters call peer-pressure too. It left me precious little for food and toiletries. Skipped meals and borrowed my roommates toiletries to make up for it. Going out with friends and planning trips during weekends was out of question. because smoking meant that No money. In fact any meaningful spending  was. Month ends would constantly mean I was behind by almost 40% in debts. Being just 23, I have no health issues, so money is my sole motivator or so I thought. I thought quitting cigarettes would allow me keep my debts in check or so I thought. 
Quitter me:
It's been a month now, This landmark is important because a month end does not only mean that the withdrawals have dissipated, in my case it also means I am going to get my next allowance. So let me review this month quickly. Had every weekend spent meaningfully with friends, of course I had money to spend it well. I did not have to worry about expenses during meals, even if it was a fine dining place. If I had friends, I could even offer to foot the entire bill. Bought toiletries for myself and my roommates.
Before it seems I am spewing some high school bull shit about how I am now rich enough to buy my own toiletries, all I wanted was to be debt free, but quitting has given me much more. Self esteem. I realize in the hindsight that smoking was robbing me off, of my money, health, time, energy and self esteem. The first four are obvious, self esteem was not. Now I know.

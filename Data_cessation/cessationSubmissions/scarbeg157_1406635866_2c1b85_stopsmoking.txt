A silly, not really a victory, victory!

2 weeks ago today I had my last cigarette. Since then I have had multiple smoking dreams. In all of them I smoked, I felt guilty, but I loved it. Last night, I was offered a secret cigarette in my dream by someone who knew I quit, but thought it wouldn't stick. I struggled with it, but I said no. And I felt good about it. See, not really a victory, but it makes me think perhaps my head is coming around to the thought that I'm done for good.

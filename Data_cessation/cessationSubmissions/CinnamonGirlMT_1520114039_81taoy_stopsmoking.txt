Can Chantix stop working or can you get a tolerance to it?

I used chantix to quit once before, about 6-7 years ago, and it worked SO well! I remember cigarettes gradually starting to taste terrible and by the end of the first week I just didn’t want one anymore. I was so angry with myself when I started again later that year.

Because it worked great that time and patches/gum have not worked in other recent attempts (will power tends to lose when I can just take the patch off or not put the gum in my mouth...)I decided that would be my go-to this time. While my cigarettes do start to taste a bit gross about halfway through, it is nowhere near like the first time and the cravings are so much worse 9 days in. I broke down and smoked one this morning and, while I shamed myself for it, I enjoyed it, which is exactly what chantix is supposed to help get rid of. 

Feeling bummed and much more stressed than I’d like to be!

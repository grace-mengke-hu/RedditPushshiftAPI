Six days in... it’s obvious that cigarettes were my only real hobby? Help.

The things I *need* to do are being avoided, either because they sound stressful or because I worry I’ll buy cigarettes as soon as I step outside today.

There is nothing I *want* to do except smoke cigarettes. And pet my cat. Who had chronic kidney disease, and will likely die this year. So I can think about that while petting him.

My boyfriend is trying to quit too. He says I should just do things, anything, just to distract myself. Unlike him, I have no real interests or hobbies. Outside of work, up until the past week, I just play games, dick around on my phone, and smoke cigarettes. 

And I feel sad and stupid, and I know these feelings will go away if I go buy some cigarettes, and the only thing stopping me is shame, and not wanting to let down people who care about me.

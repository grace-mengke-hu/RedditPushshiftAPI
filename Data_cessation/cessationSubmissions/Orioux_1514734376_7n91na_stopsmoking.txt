Dear 5 friends

As my smoke-free app has told me to tell 5 friends I've quit smoking, and I don't really want to tell my real friends (I did it about 2 months ago too and I'd  feel like a liar), I'm here to tell you guys! 

I've been smoke-free for 10d going on forever and just wanted to let you guys know!  Thanks for all your continued love and support and I wish you all the best on your journeys.

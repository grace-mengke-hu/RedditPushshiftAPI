66 Hours after Cold Turkeying a pack of American Spirit Lights a day.. Been smooth sailing and no serious temptation.. The Keto diet really works.

Aside from the animalistic attentiveness I devote to the passing strangers chiefing away, I simply have no urge to smoke after this past week of
strict keto and intense exercise.. I keep getting intrusive thoughts of past times I vomited from the bacci and it smells like Satanic filth now..  When my mind runs across the thought of buying a pack; I picture all the wasted money and just laugh. Itâ€™s meaningless to me now.. I love keto :)))

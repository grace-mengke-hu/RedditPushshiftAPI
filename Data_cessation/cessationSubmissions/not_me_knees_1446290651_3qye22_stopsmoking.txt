Two months - One of the longest ever

I have quit so many times, but I do not think ever in almost 25 years have I made it past three months. I got that number two in my star today, and I am pretty stoked about that right now.

I am still finding triggers, last night there were two of them almost back to back for some reason. They do not last long any more, and I just have to remember that I am not a smoker any more and I can get through them.

I think one thing that is helping this time around is I am not getting cocky about it, thinking I got this and it is no problem. This time I am approaching it as this is going to be a problem the rest of my life, and while it will keep getting to be a smaller and smaller problem, I cant forget that.

That, and the smell on smokers. I hate that I realize that I smelled like that all the time. It is really gross.

Finally, I just want to say thanks for everyone here. I lurk a lot more than I post or comment, but knowing that I am not alone in this, seeing others success and failures, it is keeping my head in the right place.

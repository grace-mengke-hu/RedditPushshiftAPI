I quit smoking 4 days ago.

I changed all my morning habits to avoid smoking in the morning. I used to not be able to get my morning started without a cup of coffee and a cigarette. I switched from coffee in the morning to tea and it's working pretty good so far. I am chewing gum and trying my best not to think about smoking. I really hope this year will be the year I quit smoking for good!

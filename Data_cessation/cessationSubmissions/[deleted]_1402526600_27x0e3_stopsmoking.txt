I have a serious problem.

I'm turning 24 in a few months. I'm old enough to know better.

Like most people, I started smoking in that 'impressionable' time - I was 17, I was in high school, and I smoked a lot of weed. A lot of my stoner friends smoked cigarettes, and let's be honest: I thought it was cool. So I started too. Started with Turkish Royals, moved on to Camel Wides, and from there I've been smoking a lot of Camel Filters and Marlboro Reds for the past couple years.

I've been "trying" to quit now for.. jesus, at least a year? 

The best I can do is scale back. I don't smoke now as much as I did, but I still can't stop. I buy maybe one pack a week, if that. But I live with smokers and even if I manage to go a whole day without smoking a cigarette, I start fiending. Like, seriously fiending for that head rush.

I'm such a dirty disgusting addict that I'll go to the ashtrays around the house and scavenge for butts that other smokers in the house have discarded, then dump them into my bong and smoke tobacco out of my bong.

I'm so addicted that if I smoke marijuana, at all, I have to smoke tobacco with it. I don't even smoke weed that much, maybe once a week or two, but if I do, it's in my bong with a shit ton of tobacco.

And when I don't smoke weed, I'm just scavenging and smoking tobacco out my 'water pipe'. I am literally the only person I know who actually uses bongs with their "advertised purpose" i.e. smoking tobacco.

That's disgusting - I know it is. I can't fucking stop. Jesus what the christ is wrong with me.

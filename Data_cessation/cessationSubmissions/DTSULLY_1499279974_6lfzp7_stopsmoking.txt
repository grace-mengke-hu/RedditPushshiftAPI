4 months since my last cigarette

I posted in this forum when I was 22 days along. Well, 4 months and 3 days is now the official count. Not a puff. No nicotine replacement.  Just quit. Thanks for the support! I've saved 800 dollars,  not smoked over 1500 cigarettes and have regained my freedom. It's possible people!

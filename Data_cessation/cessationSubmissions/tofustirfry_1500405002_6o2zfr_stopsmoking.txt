Day 7: 93 cigarettes not inhaled, 72 Beers not consumed

Day 7 is finally upon us! One week and feeling awesome. $170 saved, 93 cigarettes not inhaled, 72 beers not consumed, 6 mornings waking up early, 6 evenings going to bed with a calm mind and heart, many great love making sessions not fueled by substances, many dog walks not dreading a neighbor talk to me and smell alcohol+cigs at noon, a million old smells brought back to life.

It going to be a great day. Date night at sushi with no dread or anxiety about how far down the drinking and smoking train I've traveled. Just fun and good times. Today, I will not smoke with you all. Have a great day!

Almost a Month! But I Need Help! :-(

So, everything has gotten considerably easier. I'm not depressed, angry, sad etc anymore. All my associations are almost gone. Coffee, driving, after a meal, etc. The only thing still remaining is...the constant thinking about tobacco. Not Craving! Not Wanting! Just...thinking. Now it doesn't help being unemployed at the moment. All I do is sit around and browse the web looking for jobs or reddit. But, why can't I stop thinking about tobacco!!? When will this go away? Any advice? It's driving me nuts.

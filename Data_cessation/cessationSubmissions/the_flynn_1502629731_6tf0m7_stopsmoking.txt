It's been a while. Just checking in!

Hi all! I officially quit as my New Year's resolution in 2016, but I changed my quit date to the last cigarette I'll ever have: July 15, 2016. I had smoked for 8 years at that point, beginning when I joined the Marines. The promise I made to myself was simple: quit smoking when your contract ends. It turned out that would be a little more difficult than anticipated, but I learned a lot about myself during the process, including the fact that cigarettes were the only coping mechanism I had for feeling anxious or stressed.

The triggers that I have retrained:
- Drinking (this was the hardest one)
- Morning coffee
- Driving
- Being around other smokers

Long story short: it gets better. I don't feel an urge to bum "just one" at the indoor smoking bars in town, or light one up when things aren't going my way. 
Success feels better than nicotine buzz!

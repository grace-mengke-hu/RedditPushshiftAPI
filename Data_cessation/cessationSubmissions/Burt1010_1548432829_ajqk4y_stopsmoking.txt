After 24 days smoke free I've gone and blown it!!

I managed to stop smoking for 24 days but today i couldn't take it any longer. I've had 4 cigarettes and feel horrible.

When i first stopped smoking i handled the cravings by eating loads (Im kinda skinny so this wasn't a problem for me). However the last week or so i've felt soo sick from the withdrawal that i couldn't eat much, resulting in the cravings sticking around longer and getting worse, to the point where i had a smoke.

If anyone is ever in this situation don't do it! I felt soo sick afterwards and instantly felt regret and remembered the reasons why i quit in the first place. All that progress thrown away.

So my next steps are to call today a 'failure', have a few beers and probably smokes and then start it all again tomorrow! I've learnt so much from the experience that i'm confident i can do it again, just need to find alternative ways to deal with cravings i guess.

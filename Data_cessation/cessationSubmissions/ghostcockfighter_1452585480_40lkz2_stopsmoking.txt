Tapering off Gum?

Hey guys, I quit almost 6 months ago after smoking for around a decade or so and found Nicorette 4mg gum incredibly helpful. As I approach the 6 month point I'm giving serious thought on how to get rid of the gum. I've noticed that sometimes now when I'm stressed or bored I 'chain chew' it a little and I don't want the gum to replace the smoking as a new habit. It feels like it might be getting a bit compulsive. Does anybody have any ideas on how to start tapering off gum without jeopardizing my quitting? I have a very stressful job and I've got some big things going on in my life at the moment so I'm a little leery about it.

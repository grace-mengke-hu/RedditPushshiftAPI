What 90 days (plus) feels like.....

I can get up in the morning without complaint since I sleep better, the food I eat tastes fucking fantastic, I can actually jog a mile now without throwing up or thinking I'm going to die... 

I used to be mad about things all the time, and have no energy, now I'm out making things happen...

I still get a craving from time to time, but it only lasts a couple of minutes. 

in short, I'm never screwing another cigarette into these lips. 

90 days down, and I'm looking forward to the 20-30 years more I will live now.

3 weeks without nicotine. Longest I've gone since I started using, 10 years ago

I might have gained a hand full of pounds and snapped at friends/coworkers a time or two, but it was definitely worth it! I know 3 weeks isnt a large milestone in the grand scheme of things, but its a key one for me. Even Alan Carr says the first 3 weeks can be uncomfortable (while simultaneously saying how enjoyable quitting is! lol). Also, I had my fantasy football draft party over the weekend which I have been dreading as a trigger (lots of booze, junk food, and nearly all of my fantasy co-owners smoke). I made it through!! The keys to my quit were: 

 


* 1) Proper mind set. I decided that I am stronger than nicotine and I will NOT let it beat me, even if it kills me! 
* 2) Alan Carr's Easy Way. I re-read certain parts when the addiction was trying to convince me that I could have "just one" or that "now isnt the right time to quit". Dont listen to the little monster! 
* 3) Remembering that it wont feel this way forever. By day 2 or 3 my cravings were already becomming fewer and further between. Also, remembering not to mourn for yourself as a former smoker. Remember that you arent giving up anything! You are only gaining wonderful things (health, wellness, money, not smelling like ass, and most importantly- FREEDOM)!
* 4) When all else failed and I felt like I was going to explode from withdrawl, I went for a walk. Seriously, just walk. Doesnt matter where, for how long, or why. Just walk. If the cravings kick in harder, go faster. At some points I broke into a full sprint on the street outside my office. I must have looked like a lunatic, but I didnt smoke!

 

benefits I've received:
I no longer feel like a bad parent/bad influence on my young son, I have an extra $140 in my pocket, my anxiety is much less than when I was a smoker, I no longer smell like death (though lots of my friends who still smoke are somewhat nauseating to be around), my GERD/heartburn is significantly reduced, I can breathe, I dont have a bronchitis rattle in my chest, I can climb stairs/ladders without getting winded, I feel good coughing up nasty phlegm in the morning as opposed to being concerned about it, the list goes on and on.

 

Things I miss about smoking:

 

I havent posted much but this sub has been a great resource. Thank you to all who have helped me quit and stay quit. Also thank you to sunflower seeds of all flavors and types. It feels great to be a non-smoker. Sorry in advance if I screwed up the formatting...

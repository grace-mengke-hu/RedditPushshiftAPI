Relapsed again, honestly dont think i can ever get rid of this cruel poison.

Been smoking for 9 years, i just have to get rid of it. If i cant get rid of it after 9 years how on earth am i gonna do it later down the road when iv been hooked on it for 20+ years, but these relapses are putting me off.

And i just seen one of my friends recently whom i havent seen for years and told me he quit for 4 months now but the cravings never gos he sais hes gonna most likely start smoking again in the future hes just not at the moment because if he does hes coach wont let him compete in boxing, and that really got to me.

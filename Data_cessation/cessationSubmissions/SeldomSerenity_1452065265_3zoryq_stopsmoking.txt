2 days.. advice to get through the anxiety?

Two days and six hours in after 9 years at a pack a day. In the past I have battled depression. I have lost 60lbs from intense dieting and working out. But none of that compares to the difficulty of this and I am only just over two days in. At this point I can't even fathom how hard of a battle it is/was for heavier/longer term smokers. I am using the patch currently to take the "edge" off but the hardest part so far for me has been the sometimes unbearable anxiety bouts I get. Any suggestions on how to deal with this anxiety?

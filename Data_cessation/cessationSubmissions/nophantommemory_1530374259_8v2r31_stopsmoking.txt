anyone having issues with those damn JUULs

I have been off cigarettes for a couple months, but a lot of my friends will vape or use JUULs, as it’s apparently popular among the youth these days. For me, cigarettes were more of a stupid choice for a college semester or two and the withdrawals, while terrible, went away after I just forced myself to stop buying packs. 

My issue is that literally all of my friends vape, because they think it’s cool, and my will is too weak to deny them when they offer their little mod things to me. This isn’t really an issue with the extremely-low nicotine ones who do it for vape tricks or whatever, but I have this really insistent friend who pushes everyone to “take a hit of my JUUL”. For anyone who doesn’t know, JUULs are extremely high nicotine, made to help smokers get off of cigarettes and immediately onto a similar nicotine level. For whatever reason, non-smoker college students have decided that JUULs rock, and all have crippling nicotine addictions from them. I am weak-willed in social settings, but even using those stupid JUULs once will give me fucking withdrawals a day later, as I’m experiencing right now. Do I have to get a whole-ass new group of friends? None of them want to quit and, while I want to be strong, going in the middle of a group of dudes blowing clouds seems like a ridiculously unnecessary temptation.

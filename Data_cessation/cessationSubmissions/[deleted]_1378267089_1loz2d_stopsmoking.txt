Thursday is the day. Tips for getting through cravings?

Also, any tips on how to not become *too* irritable?  I have a three year old son that I stay home with, and I really don't want to snap at him for something small.  Also, my wife is pregnant and holy hell, I don't want to upset her by being a dick.  Any help or tips would be greatly appreciated.

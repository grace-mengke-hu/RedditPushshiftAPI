Smoking to vaping

Hey guys, just wanted to see if anyone here has stopped smoking and switched to vaping? Are there tools out there to inform me of how different it is? From New Years I haven’t had a cigarette and have instead been vaping with a tobacco and flavoured mix. Just wanted to see if anyone here has had experiences with it? I’ve been showing signs of depression (which I’ve had for over a decade) since the switch, but hasn’t been anything I can’t handle, maybe a few bad hours in the day. Your tips and guidance would be greatly appreciated

Day 2. I cancelled a commitment because I didn't want to be around the temptation of smokes

Yesterday morning I had my last smoke. It was Sunday. Today I went to work, had a long ass staff meeting, then went home in heavy traffic. I really, really wanted a cigarette. I cancelled my weekly Dungeons and Dragons games because one of the guys smokes. I cannot see a scenario where I don't end up with a cigarette in my hand. So I cancelled for this week. I'll brave it next week.

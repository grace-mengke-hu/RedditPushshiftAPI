I don't wanna.....

It's time to stop. But I'm not ready. I'm doing it for my husband.  I've got so many other things going on and I use smoking as a crutch. I smoked my last smoke an hour ago. I'm a depressed mess on a good day. I'm nervous about not having my smokes. I'm going to cave. I always do.

Avoided smoking with old friends

I had a long weekend with some old college friends that I hadn't seen in a few years.  They were all my best smoking buddies for years.  They all still smoke.  It was really tough when they'd step out for a smoke break.  

I normally don't really get tempted very much anymore, but I had an overwhelming urge to fall back into that old familiar habit.  So, I stayed inside whenever they'd go out for a smoke.  I felt weak enough to not want to risk it.

But, I stayed strong and I am not going to make the same mistakes I've made in the past.  Not one more!  Never again!

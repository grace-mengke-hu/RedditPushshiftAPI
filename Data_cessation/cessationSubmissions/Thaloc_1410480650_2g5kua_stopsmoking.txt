Day 4, hardest yet.

Cravings I can deal with. Today my body went into full revolt, lack of concentration, motivation, energy. My nose is all runny, I'm pretty gassy for no other reason, it's the pits.

Worst part is I'm really trying to not let this all affect my 3 y/o negatively but I can tell she knows I ain't feeling to good. Between her and the 3 month old puppy I have taken a few time-outs myself to just lay in front of the fan and cool off.

Fuck Nictotine .....ğŸ˜¡ğŸ˜¡ğŸ˜¡

I have quit smoking 4 days ago . First 3 days were easy but now it is too difficult to control. I have lots of work pressure in my job these days  as well. Today in the morning i was about to give up but went to gym instead n craving went off but now again craving came back even harder ...my head is foggy ğŸ™„ğŸ™„ğŸ™„ğŸ™„ğŸ™„

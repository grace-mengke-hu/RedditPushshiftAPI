Another try...

Well, I fell off the wagon and started smoking again about 2 weeks ago.  I quit *again* on Thursday and have almost a day and half under my belt using the 21mcg patch.  Whoopee!

I have to admit, this forums helps and when I stopped checking in on the forum I relapsed.  I plan to check this fucker every day now.  I also pinned up the empty last pack on my wall with my new quit date.

Well, here's to quitting again...  I just sent in a new badge request...

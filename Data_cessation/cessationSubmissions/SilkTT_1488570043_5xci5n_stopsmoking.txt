My first 'quit smoking' diary entry. Wish me luck guys, if I can pass that three month mark this time, I can anything (I bloody hope)!!!

This is the quit date. The date when I can say 'I no longer have to smoke'
I want to make it this time, for my partner, my family, my colleagues, that all get to smell me all the time. I also want to quit for me. That's the main thing. I don't want to keep being stinky and looking old. I want to be fit and youthful. The only way I can be fit and youthful is to start at the start and get rid of this horrid belief that I need these disgusting, stinky, expensive killers. 
I don't HAVE to smoke anymore. I can say no thanks, that shit stinks

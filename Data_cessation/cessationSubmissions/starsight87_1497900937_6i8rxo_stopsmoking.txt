Day 46- Down 7 pounds

When I first started this I weighed 193 pounds. I had a hard time catching my breath when walking briskly. I am not down to 186 and am running a little more than 4k three times a week. It has been an awesome feeling to see health become more of a priority.

I am still struggling with dropping the amount I drink but definitely more mindful of it since I stopped smoking. Feeling great and to anyone starting their first days. It gets better and you will look back before too long and realize it was all worth it.

New member/non-smoker

Like many here, I quit smoking New Years Day. I'm a member over at quitnet and figured a second support network couldn't hurt. This is my first foray into Reddit as well - still learning. 

Today's Day 9, I hope it's easier than Day 8, which was surprisingly hard. I smoked for ~15 years and my wife still smokes, so I have my work cut out for me!

Anyway, I'm looking forward to leaning on this group over the coming weeks. Thanks in advance!

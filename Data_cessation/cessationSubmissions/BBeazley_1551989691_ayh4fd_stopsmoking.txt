I'm making a 'Motivating Songs Playlist' and would love everyone's help. Post your favourite song(s)

Hi All, I am finding music a handy tool to help keep myself in the right frame of mind.

I was wondering if you guys could help me with your favourite songs?

Heres some:

'Eye of the Tiger' by Survivor 
'Que Sera' by Justice Crew

Help me out folks!

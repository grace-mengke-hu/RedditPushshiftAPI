Took one drag the other day to prove to myself I could take just one drag. I did, and I wasn't that into it.

I was drunk hanging out with a buddy of mine (a failed quitter). He was having a smoke and I asked for a drag. He apprehensively obliged. I took the drag. Meh. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't good. It certainly didn't make me want to pick up the habit again.

**Note:** Just because this was true for me doesn't mean it's true for everyone. It was a stupid risk to take regardless, but I was pretty sure I could handle it without relapsing. I'm glad I did it because I proved to myself that I have more control over my addiction than vice-versa. That doesn't mean I recommend anybody else do it.

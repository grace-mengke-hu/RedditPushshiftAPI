I think I have mouth cancer. I am so scared and anxious.

Found a small hard-white lump under my tongue. I had been feeling the bump for a few months and just saw it. I looked up photos online and it looked identical. Going to a doctor tomorrow-apparently only way to tell is to get it tested. I am so scared. I don't want to let my parents down. Smoker for 6 years. The worst part is the fear is making me smoke more.

Almost at 200 days...

I can't believe how quickly time has gone by.  I can't believe I made it this far!  I can't believe I haven't touched one cigarette even though my SO is still smoking.  I can't believe I can go out and drink without smoking an entire pack.  I can't believe it's almost been 200 days!

Thank you r/stopsmoking!  I credit this sub for kicking my ass and helping me take the first step!

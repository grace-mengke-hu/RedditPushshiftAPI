Day 2 and feeling alright

I quit yesterday after hacking up some interesting things from my lungs over the weekend. I didn't necessarily plan on quitting but I wanted to see how long I could go yesterday without one and....I went all day so....here I am, day 2. Feeling good about it all. Chewing a good amount of gum and doing a good amount of push ups when I get a craving. I've smoked for 12 years, since I was 18 years old. And this is the longest I've gone without a cig in that time. Surprisingly, it's going well. I hope it continues to go well. Slight headache, getting cravings but I manage to pull through them. Just keeping myself busy. Keep moving. Idle hands are no good.

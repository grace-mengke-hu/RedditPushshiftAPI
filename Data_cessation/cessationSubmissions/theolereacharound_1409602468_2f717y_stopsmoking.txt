One month + a method/timing that has finally sealed the deal

Got a star! Hooray! The first month of the rest of my life. 

*DISCLAIMER: I know this method won't work for everyone, it just timed out really well and I wanted to share!*

I decided to wait until not only was I ready, but until I could coincide quitting smoking with a big change in my life. It is SO much easier to start new habits when you aren't reminded by your old ones...such as a living arrangement, work, routine, what have you. If you aren't constantly seeing your porch or taking work-day breaks at the same place and time, it's easier to create a new life WITHOUT smoking. 

I recently moved cities which meant changing all of those. Job, routine, house, friends, the whole shebang. I decided I would NOT smoke in this state. My last cigarette was on the state line and I haven't touched one since. Now I know this isn't an option for many people but I am writing this because it's been a change AROUND me that has helped my mental brain block out cravings.

When I first got here, I started meeting new people and had this realization: This person has never, and will never know or associate me as a smoker. What used to be part of my identity, free at last! That is a feeling that is so unbelievably great. New life, new me! 

I've got plenty of work to do going forward but I hope this sparks some kind of encouragement to future quitters or struggling ones. Make change, keep the change!

Just quit, how to do I relieve the "there's nothing to look forward to now" feeling?

I used to have a routine at work and throughout my day where I would have what was essentially a smoking schedule. Now that I have quit, I don't have those little rewards throughout my day, so the day is way longer. I'm having withdrawl pangs but no mental desire to actually smoke because I know it would suck. Just sucks that there's nothing really to look forward to to break up my day. Any advice on how to deal?

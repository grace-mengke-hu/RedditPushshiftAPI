Ahh so busy yesterday went outside for smoke and didn't even remember I quit :(

I'm starting over at Day 0 today. I literally went outside at the end of my day, which was super busy, not even remembering I quit. Was total habit. I didn't even realize it until I got home and was getting ready for bed. Recommitting today and starting over at Day 0.  Still in the game!

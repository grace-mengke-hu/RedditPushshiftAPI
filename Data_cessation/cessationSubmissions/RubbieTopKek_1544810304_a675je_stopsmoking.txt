Need help starting to stop

I’m an underage teen who’s been vaping for 6 months, and I’ve been trying to stop for a while. I’ve tried setting timers progressively further and further apart, I’ve tried cold turkey, and I even gave my vape away. But I ended up getting another one because the headaches were terrible. I get that vaping isn’t smoking, but I hope this is still a place where I can go to for help. I understand that a comment can’t fix all of my problems in an instant, but I see now that I need some outside help.

So, how should I get started? What should I look out for? Are there any discrete means of getting professional help for cheap? Right now, I just want a base to go on as I begin this process.

Thank you so much!

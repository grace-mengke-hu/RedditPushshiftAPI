Quit smoking as of the morning of Monday, November 18th. It'll be a full four days now in one hour. I think I'm gonna make it!

Today was particularly hard at the end, but most of the day I didn't even think about it. I've tried quitting twice. The second time I made it a week and a half (before trying pouches... -.-) 

I think I'm going to make it this time, though, and the past few days have actually been a cinch because I'm looking at this as more of an experience (I'm interested in experiencing withdrawal symptoms, I guess looking at it as something that not everybody goes through :P), and when it gets really tough, I remind myself smoking is not an option and I just treat it as if I'm sick with a virus. Then it goes from "I NEED A CIGARETTE" to becoming "I have a weird, sour headache."

Don't know if that makes sense, but whatever. I'm four days in.

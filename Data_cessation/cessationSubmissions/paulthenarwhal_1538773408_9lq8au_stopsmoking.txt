For some reason I chewed a piece of nicotine gum last night.

I couldn't sleep, I was bore, I found a left over piece of nicotine gum in my car from my early days of my quit. I only chewed the gum for like a week so I actually have a largish amount left over. I've also been nicotine free for 6 months. Thought to myself, why not chew a piece? That was at midnight. I stayed up sick to my stomach, head spinning, terrible feeling until 4:30 am. Would not recommend. Just reminded myself how much not fun that particular substance actually is.

Lessons from 200 Days

1) Be accountable - I quit with my partner but I informed others close to me of what I was doing. Being able to lean on them in potential moments of weakness was important.

2) Be present - I had been derailed on previous attempts at quitting because I would not think through my actions. I would be working and all of a sudden I would be outside having a smoke. Did I actively choose this? Nope. Once I made the effort to actively think through my smoking actions, many of these temptations faded away.

3) (Try to) Be patient - I really liked smoking. The taste, the burn, all of it. I quit with medication but it was no picnic. It will get easier, I promise.

4) Be active (mentally or physically) - My worst days were the ones wallowing in my own self-despair. Try to take your mind of smoking any way you can. 

5) Be thankful - I honestly do not think I could have done it without my support system, including this subreddit. The stories and positive energy is wonderful. Give back through upvotes or comments.

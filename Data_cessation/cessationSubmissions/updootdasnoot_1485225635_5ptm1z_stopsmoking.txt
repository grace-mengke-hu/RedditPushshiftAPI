Day 1 down. First post. Thought this was worth popping my cherry. Thanks in advance for any support

Attempting to quit. After a long first day going cold turkey and no tactics other than a bunch of toothpicks, I am happy to say that today is over. Sought out this thread and found it motivational. This day was tough for me so if anybody has tips on material to watch, things to try to curve a craving,...etc. I'm open to any suggestions and help. Thanks.

I smoked

I was at a festival yesterday and I had a few. 

For me personally I still quit since I'm not going to buy 

myself a pack and go back to being an actual smoker. 

For me the Badge symbolizes the day that I stopped 

being a " smoker " so I am wondering 

what you guys think, do you guys think I should reset my badge or not ? 

Edit : Stupid fucking decision .. Craving and Anxiety from cravings are ruining my day.

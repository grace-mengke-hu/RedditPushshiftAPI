My body is dying after quitting!! (three weeks cig free)

Everyone, I am wondering, if there is anyone here who's a bit further along than me who can tell me if, at this point, I should be feeling like death? I thought it would only be like the first week or so that I would feel most of the physical side effects of the withdrawals. I've been using a vape device for the sole purpose of helping me quit, and it's worked, but I feel like the toxins from the cigarettes are still working their way out and my ass is paying the price! Not...not literally, you get it. Anyway, should my lungs still feel like death and should this headache be here? Back is hurting as well. Any advice or info would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

Two weeks - Here's a poem to celebrate that

Smoking is bad
Fresh breath is rad
So I quit smoking
And I am not joking
I feel clean, light and happy
I release lung mucus which is crappy
Now I breathe easy without rasping
Is there any sense in smoking, just asking!

Thank you, you were an amazing crowd.

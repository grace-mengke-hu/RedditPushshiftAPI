Pack Years to Disease Correlation

I recently did some research and found out that people with 30+ pack years should get screened for lung cancer. I smoked &lt;5 cigarettes a day for 8 years. So that comes out to 2 pack years. Does that mean I have smoked a "safe" amount to avoid horrible diseases like cancer?

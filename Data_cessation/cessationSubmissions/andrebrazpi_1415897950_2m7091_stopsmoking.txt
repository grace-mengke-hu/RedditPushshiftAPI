Do e-cigs (w/o nicotine) help in quitting?

Hi fellas, I just quit two days ago, and I miss the activity of smoking more than the chemicals in it. Is an e-cig/e-vape a good way to curb that? I also like to smoke outside of bars/clubs so it could be a good way to keep that social aspect of smoking.

I appreciate your thoughts.

Edit: Thanks for all your comments. I went to the a vape shop, but ended up not buying anything. I've decided that I need to quit cold turkey for now. Maybe I'll get one with 0 nicotine in a few months after the habitual cravings go away.

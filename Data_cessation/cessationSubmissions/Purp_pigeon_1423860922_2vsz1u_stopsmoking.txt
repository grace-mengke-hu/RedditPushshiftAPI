It gets a lot easier

One day it won't matter when other people talk about smoking , it won't matter if you see someone smoking in a movie and it won't matter when people are smoking right in front of you.

Everyone I know that has managed to quit for good ( 1 year + ) has gotten to the realization that smoking is fucking ridiculous and that that it's probably the worst and most stupid habit they have ever had.

The good news is , once you have that mindset you will stop feeling like your missing out on something. 

Yesterday was my 4 month anniversary of staying free , my mindset changed about 8 months ago. It took me several relapses and the feelings of guilt afterwords to get to the mindset that took over 121 days ago.

I feel proud of myself. 

Guys , Good Luck !

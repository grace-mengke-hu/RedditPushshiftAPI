400! Cigs not smoked. But my brain still trying to trick me into it.

It's more than 2 weeks of not smoking, physical cravings are going significantly down, but for the last couple of days, my brain constantly tries to trick me into having a smoke. Telling me things like: c'mon u have proven that u can quit cold turkey, one cig now does not harm, etc. Very strange - need to stay strong! Is it normal that this is happening after 16 days of quitting?

So how long does this awfulness last?

My last cigarette was 4:00 PM August 18th. So I've been roughly 80 hours smoke free my time. The first two days were a breeze. Not to say there weren't moments of intense cravings but those were minimal and for the most part I was just slightly on edge. However today, oh man today, I have felt on the verge of completely losing my sh*t on anyone for anything from the time I woke up. My reasons for quitting are the usual. I want to be the healthiest I possibly can, smoking is gross, and above all my wife and I just had our first child (a little girl) and I can't stand the thought of smelling like that to her/encouraging or validating her decision to start smoking/not being around for her because of cancer. Ok so now that you have all of the unnecessary information I can ask the question I came here to ask. How long approximately is the quitting process terrible (almost painful) until it gets better? I was smoking roughly 3/4 a pack a day. I feel I have been lucky with the ease so far but it hit me today like a ton of bricks. Thank you so much for your input! 

TL;DR: Smoked 3/4 a pack a day. Didn't suck too much for first two days. Today (day 3) was THE WORST. How long does the REAL suck last?

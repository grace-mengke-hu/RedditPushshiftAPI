Stop smoking app

I just wanted to say that using the app has made it possible for me to stop. Using the diary to record my thoughts and feelings,  doing the daily self awareness missions like the mantras and recording my daily withdrawal amount on a chart have ment I could understand and quit. I'm so very grateful for the time and effort people have put into making the app to help people like myself whom had tried quitting over 100 times before and failed. No longer is my life in a whirlwind of despair :)

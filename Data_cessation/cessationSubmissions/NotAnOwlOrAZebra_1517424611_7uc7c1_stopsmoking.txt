What works and what doesn't?

I've been smoking for about 4 years now. Roughly a pack and a half a day. I take vyvanse for work to help me focus and I told myself I was going to quit smoking this year. Just seeing what all helps y'all or what doesn't help y'all fight the urge, whether it be gum, candy, will power, etc. Thanks for the help and I hope to be cig free soon!

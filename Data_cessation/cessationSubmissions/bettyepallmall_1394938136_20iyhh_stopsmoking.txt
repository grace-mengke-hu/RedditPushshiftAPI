First day smoke free!

I've been talking about quitting smoking for years, today I woke up and just did it. I've come to realize that you don't really take it a day at a time, it's a minute at a time. Every single minute is a struggle. But! On the upside... Every minute is also a victory! I'm 28 years old and have been smoking a pack a day since I was 17, that's my entire adult life! I'm worried about tomorrow. I'm worried that I'm posting this too soon. I'm worried about five minutes from now - if we're being honest. But for right now, I've gone one day. I'm in bed and about to go to sleep, that means today is over. 

Any helpful tips for the first few days? I'll get to them tomorrow. Goodnight for now!

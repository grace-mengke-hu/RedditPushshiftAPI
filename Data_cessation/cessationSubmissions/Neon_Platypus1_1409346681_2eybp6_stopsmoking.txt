Almost a week...

And let me say, I've already noticed a major difference in my life. I feel so much happier without cigarettes. I've had depression and anxiety issues since my senior year of high school (that's about three years ago) and started smoking big time two years ago, almost a half-pack a day. 

Ever since I quit just last week, I've never felt happier. I work out, I eat healthier, my confidence has improved, and I've started to love myself as much as I used to love those cigarettes. Yeah, I still have urges, but they are definitely narrowing down to a slight ^^^please? but then disappear. 

I can't wait to get to week 2. Then my first month, and every month after.

This subreddit six months ago, and why it's awesome.

I love going back to old posts from when I first quit, just looking at the comments of encouragement, and seeing all of the badges.  Today, they're almost all still going strong.  The 3 or 4 day badges back then are all over 185 now.  Stick with it, guys!  It's so dang satisfying watching that badge get bigger and bigger.

Any advice for someone who desperately wants to get free of smoking?

Hi guys (and girls),

I've been trying so hard lately to kick the addiction, but with no luck. I tried cold turkey and caved after a few days. Tried switching to an e-cig but it gave me mad headaches, lasted 2 weeks then I couldn't take it. If I didn't get the headaches, I would have been happy on it as a stepping stone.

In the past I've read easyway and got off it for about 2 months, but caved eventually.

I worry because I have a reason to stop smoking now. I'm moving in with my girlfriend soon, and I really want to build a life with her and have all the health that I need to enjoy it. I don't want us to get a few years down the line just to find out that something's wrong with me and end up breaking her heart.

No matter what I do, I just can't seem to get free of it.

Can anyone offer any advice?

Thank you.

I'm on day 33 and I've had a craving for the past 3 days straight. Just wanted to rant

It feels only slightly better than day 1 right now. And this is coming off a 4 day streak of almost no cravings. It started out with a brutal nightmare and when I woke up that morning I knew I was in for a bad time. Ever since then I've been in constant craving mode, not wanting to be around anyone, angry, opinionated, and nightmares every night. I just wanted to rant, this addiction is fucking bullshit! I'll never go back after what it's taken from me, but holy fuck, I thought I'd already paid the pied piper, I really feel myself losing strength, and I'm terrified this going to be another week of hell.

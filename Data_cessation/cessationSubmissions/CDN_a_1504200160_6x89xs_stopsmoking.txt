I quite as of NOW! 48 years...

No more baloney. Smoked my last 20 mins ago ... keeping reaching for a pack... and I chuckle. This is madness... 48 years. I'm a pensioner now and living on a modest income, not to mention it's  killing me... coughing, hacking...breathless, weak...  So I'm just thinking... it's the money stupid, if nothing else! I hope I make it.

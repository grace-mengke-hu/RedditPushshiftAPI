Exercising?

So for the past while I have not been happy with my belly.  I know that I would like it to be a bit smaller and firmer, so this morning, before I went to bed, I was on youtube and a video popped up on my main page on how to lose belly fat after 5 minutes a day.  I downloaded the video and when I woke up this evening, I work nights, I did my first 5 minutes.  OMG!!!  When I was done, I was wheezing and totally out of breath.

I guess my reason for this post is that I am wondering if others in this group have had similar issues when first starting to exercise and has it gotten better with time?

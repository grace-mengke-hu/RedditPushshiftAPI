Two weeks in

I got halfway through Carr's Easyway, and stopped smoking. Like the title implies, it was much easier than I thought. I feel great. I can take a full breath again. 

Maybe not the smartest thing to do, but I went out drinking with smoking friends on days 2 and 3, and abstained (it was the most difficult trial so far). However, that experience really solidified it into my mind that the cravings were my body withdrawling from the nicotine. They weren't a part of me, I wasn't weak for not wanting to quit because of them, they were a natural byproduct of years of nicotine intake.

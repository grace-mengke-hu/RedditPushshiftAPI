Quitting smoking is not that hard, but it IS annoying.

I recently quit after attending the worst 'quit smoking' class ever. I quit after the first session because listening to all the bad to horrible excuses the other participants had about why they continue to smoke made my head snap out of it. I realized I was no better myself, but hearing other intelligent people say it made me realize how unfulfilling smoking actually is, and the only reason I continue to smoke is because I am afraid.

What surprised me most about the withdrawal was how mild it actually was. I had a slight unrest in my body for 2-4 days, and that was about it. However, the annoying part about withdrawing from nicotine is how extremely persistent the brain is in reminding you to take a smoke. The first few days it was constantly. Several times an hour. My brain screamed for all the dopamine and whatnot the nicotine releases, so It remains you a lot the first days, then it gets longer between and the duration of "go get a cig" thoughts gets shorter.

So, in short: Nicotine withdrawal is a pain in the fucking ass because its main withdrawal symptom is a strong recurring reminding mekanism. All the other withdrawal symptoms are neglictable; slight unrest, some very slight anxiety. But mostly it is the nagging.

tl;dr: Physical symptoms when quitting smoking are extremely minor, the hard part is ignoring the "go get a smoke" message your brain sends out the first few days after quitting.


Also, fun fact: When you cold turkey nicotine many receptors in your brain become hypersensitive (opposite to coke addiction), witch means that when you do something _other_ than smoking, but still triggers the reward system, you get more "high". This effect lasts a couple months and just knowing this last bit helped me a great deal.

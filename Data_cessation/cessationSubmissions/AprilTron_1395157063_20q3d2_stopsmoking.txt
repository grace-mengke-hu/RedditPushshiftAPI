Day 2- Still Going Strong

Last week, I had a severe pain, and my doctor is making me go to radiology to get an ultrasound.  Most likely, it's nothing. But there is this .0000001% chance it could be ovarian cancer.  I'm 29.

I had a panic attack, and I realized while it's most likely not cancer, how can I have a panic attack over it AND STILL SMOKE?  At some point, maybe now, maybe 3 years, maybe 30 years, smoking will cause me to get cancer, and I'm willingly doing this to myself. 

So my last smoke was noon on Sunday when I finished my pack and that was it.  The cravings haven't been too horrible.  

I am a bottomless pit of food right now, but I'll worry about that in a few days.  My friends and family have been very supportive, and I want to make them proud.

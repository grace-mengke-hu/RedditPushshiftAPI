Insatiable appetite...

So I've now stopped for over 3 weeks and I feel I'm doing fine! 
I now, however, have an insatiable appetite and I've put on enough weight in a short period of time that I'm having to buy new clothes...
Has anyone got any tips on not eating so much? I just can't seem to control it at all and it's bizarre, I've never been one to enjoy food at all really but now I can't get enough!

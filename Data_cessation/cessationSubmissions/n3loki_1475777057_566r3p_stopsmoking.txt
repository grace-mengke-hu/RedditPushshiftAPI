I just need to get this out. Tell my story. Coz I've been handling things on my own

Hi. I hope you guys don't mind this rant. I need advice or just to hear other people's experiences on this. And I just need to get this out

So I quit cold turkey September 18 last year coz I caught pneumonia and my grandpa died of prostate cancer. When we got the diagnosis, he was already stage 4. He was a smoker in his youth and there were long term effects. 

Prior to that, I smoked 3-4 sticks a day

Withdrawal was horrible. I would hug my pillow tightly until I fell asleep and my joints would feel cold

Fourth month onwards was better. Barely thought of smoking

But when I was nearing my 1 year mark, I started thinking about smoking again. Even now I'm thinking about it. And it's worse when I go out with friends since they all smoke

My thoughts are along the lines of "what if I had a puff or one stick for old times sake? Besides, smoking felt good right. What's the worst thing a stick can do? I'll just go cold turkey afterwards"

I'm scared I might fall off the edge. Or I might create a pattern. Or worse, I might start smoking again. 

I honestly miss smoking. But I know it's bad. And I'm doing fine without it. This could just be a moment of weakness. Still, the contradiction exists within me. And I feel bad.

At times, I would joke to my girlfriend about teaching her to smoke so if we smoke, it'd be somehow legit. Coz I feel most accountable to her. But in hindsight, I don't think I could do that. I love her too much to do something bad to her

So, any advice? Similar experiences? 

I need reassurance. I need to know that this is just a hump, that it's just part of the process. I really thought quitting would be second nature to me after a year

TL:DR: still having cravings after a year. Any advice or stories that might help?

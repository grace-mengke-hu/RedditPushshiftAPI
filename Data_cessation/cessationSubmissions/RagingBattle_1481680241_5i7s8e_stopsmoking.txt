Day 10 - Swimming in pain

I was fine. I almost didn't have cravings, just two or three weak moments easily dealt with.

But yesterday I started feeling like s**t. Sore throat, heavy head, weakness, muscle pain, feels like a flu (instead I've learnt it's part of the quitting).
Today I had a bad bad bad discussion with my family, ended up with one of my knuckles now red.
A week from now I got an exam, I can't concentrate and don't know what to expect if that exam goes badly.

Aside from all of this, I'm amazed by how irrelevant is to me the absence of the cigarette.


To all of you, keep going, this is one of those challenges that, if taken seriously, will make you love every part of the process, even the most painful.
You'll be a new person. More respected. More healthy. You'll have time and energy to do what you love.

Eleven Months! Woo!

I still dream about smoking. And I still cough up lung confetti in the shower more often than not. I'm up forty pounds, but I was always too skinny anyways. I'm going to live a lot longer now that I'm not a smoker, and in those days I will not regret quitting. I will only regret starting in the first place. Five year old Me would be pissed, but modern day Me is pretty damn proud of himself.

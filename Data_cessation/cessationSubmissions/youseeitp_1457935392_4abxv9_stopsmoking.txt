Recently crossed over the three year mark.

I wanted to check in and say you all can do it.  Going strong after three years now.  Almost never think about it.  The idea of going weeks without even a thought of smoking seemed so far away when I was in my first days and weeks.  Keep going and eventually you will break the back of that monster that keeps you hooked. You can do this.

20 Days. Just failed

Hi all, so I have ADD and have been really struggling to let go of the habit of smoking. My most recent quit attempt (which I just failed today unfortunately) lasted 19 days 18 hours. At this point I was obviously over the nicotine addiction. 

I found myself having severe panic attacks throughout the day due to the stress of work and I had no methods outside of smoking to ease the stress and anxiety I was dealing with. I just feel really down now and that i've let everyone and myself down. Does anyone have any advice?

Let's Really Do This

I am trying again. I need to do this. I.am an athlete, or was. Further my wife is leaving me and I need to document my living expenses, which did not include cigarettes 14 months ago. It will be very hard because I am struggling with my wife seeking a divorce. My wife simply seems to experience emotions differently than I. She is very high strung, unable to feel empathy or accept any accountability for any if this. I am the reason for all her stress she says. She is embarrassed by me, and I make her want to vomit when she looks at me. She has been threatening to leave for 10 years now.  Yet , somehow my kids and I have a wonderful relationship. We regularly  take adventures in the out of doors and I am there for them always, telling them I love them and giving them my time.

 I have never heard any verbal abuse while in any of my other relationships. This has been a mental quagmire I have been trying to manage through for a long time. I struggle with self blame but have done enough research to know her behavior is not my fault. Therefore, although it breaks, and I still love her (or so it seems), I need to get healthy for my kids. They are going to need me. *They should really have their father at home. SMH.

The good news is I quit drinking completely 61 days ago. Time to give up the nasty, yellow and brown tobacco smoke. New Adventures await. My bicycle is calling! Please wish me strength to get through all of this with my dignity intact.

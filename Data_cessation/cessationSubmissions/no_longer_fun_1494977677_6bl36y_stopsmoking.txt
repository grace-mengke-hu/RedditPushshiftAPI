Combination of hormones, side effects and dopamine/nicotine withdrawal? Sound possible?

Hey there!

I had my last cigarette on 2nd May, and this the longest by far I've gone without a cigarette in over 10 years! I've been taking some medication to make the process easier and they definitely worked - my cravings are minimal and I'm pretty sure the physical element of craving has gone and it's been interesting paying attention to habit-triggers because there were some I hadn't really noticed before. However, I've been feeling pretty low and demotivated to do anything much lately but I'm not sure whether several different things are interacting with one another and I thought I'd ask if anyone else has experienced something similar?

- side effects from hormonal BC + being due on (I didn't realise I'd be due on or I'd probably have delayed giving up until afterwards but oh well)

- side effects from the medication I'm taking to help quit (no other side effects, have been taking them for 4 weeks).

- natural effects of nicotine withdrawal

- natural sudden deficit in dopamine while everything adjusts.

Does this ring true for anyone's experiences out there? I'm leaning towards the lack of dopamine being a big factor; something similar happened when I gave up weed a few months back and I rode that out eventually.

A star is born...

Ok, I know it's only a badge on an Internet forum, but I honestly didn't believe I could get here, and having checked into this place every day for the last month, this is actually a big deal for me!
I suffered from anxiety, depression and low self esteem for years. I thought I was weak-willed and had little-to-no self-control and that was just part of who I was, just like I thought being a smoker was part of who I was. I smoked 15 filterless a day for 16+ years and thought that I liked it, that it helped me. I WAS WRONG! I have been smoke and nicotine free for a whole month. I have discovered that I'm stronger than I ever gave myself credit for, I have shot down those cravings one by one, I have learned the joys of yoga, walking for miles and miles and filling my ever-expanding lungs with sweet fresh air and the rush that can give you. It's not always been easy and I've also discovered a lot of rage-issues that had been hiding under the smoke all those years which I've been dealing with (for once) instead of running/hiding from them. But my anxiety has improved, my skin and hair have improved, my lungs no longer make wheezing sounds when I take a deep breath, nor do I get out of breath ruining up stairs or climbing steep hills, my life is no longer punctuated by smoke breaks (my app says I've saved 36 hours that I would've wasted smoking before) and I don't have to worry about stinking like an ash tray around my family. Best of all, knowing that I'm doing this has been really empowering, has set my mind to a positive outlook on life. Stopping smoking has literally changed my life! Seriously folks, if I can do this and not want to go back EVER, then so can you. Take heart new quitters - your life is going to get so much better!

TL:DR: 15-a-day smoker for 16+ years quit one month ago. Things are getting better and better. Thank you r/stopsmoking - you guys have made all the difference.

Tomorrow

Tomorrow is day one for me, again. I'm nervous and scared for what will come of quitting smoking. I've tried and tried numerous time before, longest being almost a month. Seems like every time I quit, I keep finding this reasons to go and buy a pack. I feel like this time is different. I hate smoking. Every time I smoke, as soon as I am done, I hate it. I'm going to use this, and other obvious reasons as my motivating factors. I'm hoping I'll be one of those coming back every month, 6 months, year to celebrate my quit with you all! I'll see you in a month!!

Any advice?

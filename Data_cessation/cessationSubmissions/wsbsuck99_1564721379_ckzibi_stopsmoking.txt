I quit smoking 1 year ago today

1 year ago today I decided it was finally time to give up drinking and smoking and set some new habits in life as I'm getting closer to 30.  I was a pack a day smoker for 10 years and a very heavy drinker on the weekends. My favorite cigs were the American Spirit, light blues. Smoking used to be my main way of coping with stress. I'm not gonna sugar coat any of my experience quitting. To be honest quitting was one of the hardest things I've ever done in my life. I vividly remember the first three months being god awful with an easily triggered anxiety. At the 6-month mark, I had gotten over the cravings and the anxiety was starting to pass. I basically had to retrain my brain's reward mechanisms. After 1 year I'm proud to say that I'm a nonsmoker. I have friends who smoke around me but it doesn't bother me at all anymore. I've simply just accepted the fact that I don't smoke anymore. No jealousy or regret.  Since quitting smoking one year ago, I've dropped over 60ibs and feel in the best shape of my life. I've found music and exercise to be my new best new way of dealing with stress. PS, don't ever doubt your ability to quit. You can.

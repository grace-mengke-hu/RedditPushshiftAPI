Time to try again now that I have a really good reason.

Hi everyone. So last year I decided to quit smoking. I made it 6 months cold turkey before stress got to me and I started up again. 

So I have decided to try again. I am really sick of feeling like shit every day and also have just found out that my GF of 10 years is pregnant with our first child.

This time I am taking Zyban to help. Hoping this time will be the time. So good luck to everyone else on here, we can all do this.

Quit over 2 weeks ago - feeling adverse effects...

I smoked for over 8 years.  It's been about 18 days without any nicotine.  
The past 3 days I've been unable to crack my back (I usually can) and have been waking up extremely lightheaded and dizzy, for hours after waking up.  
Has anything similar happened to anyone else?  
Any ideas what's going on?  
Is this maybe hypertension, or my blood pressure re-stabilizing?

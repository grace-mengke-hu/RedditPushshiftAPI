Almost at 20 days, and I found new motivation!

So there I was, walking towards the latrine to make a head call, when I see people sparking up at the smoke shack. 

"God Damn I want a cigarette." 

I muttered under my breath. 

When suddenly one of the soldiers in the smoke shack starts coughing and gagging, before suddenly spitting an impressive amount of whatever-the-fuck on the ground in front of him. 

Needless to say, I feel proud that I am making a move before I ever get in that sort of condition.  

Stay strong guys!

Coughing up junk finally! Hooray!

Yesterday I started coughing up disgusting brown crap. In fact, I coughed up that shit so hard this morning that I threw up mid-hack. Doesn't seem to be a cold and I seem to have this vague, almost ashtray-ish taste when I cough. So I'm gonna guess it's my lungs clearing themselves.

Yay! I've never been so excited about coughing till I puke before. Go cilia go!!

Happy coughing, everyone!

*I hear this doesn't happen to everyone and/or it can come well into a quit instead of at the beginning, so if you aren't coughing up shit, don't be too worried there is something wrong. On the flip side, I've seen some posts here about coughs that seem abnormal or are not easing up or going away after a reasonable time. If that's the case, you should go see a doctor.

*ETA: Guess I spoke too soon. Turns out I have pneumonia. Still grateful for lungs clearing out, though.

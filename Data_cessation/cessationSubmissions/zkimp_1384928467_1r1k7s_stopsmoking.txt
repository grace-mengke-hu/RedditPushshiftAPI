Three Hundred and Sixty Five days of thanks to you

I'm extremely happy today, I've hit a milestone I never thought I could reach and it has been hard at times. 

You all helped me in ways you may not know, by watching the guys with 14 days when I was starting and reading about what I could expect to the many tips and suggestions to avoid cravings, to suggesting the Allen Carr's book and the insane amount of cold water, the endless discussions about vaping and cold turkey. And then at 3/4/5 months in to read all the newcomers and your success and failures made me not rest on my laurels and keep constant vigilance on the monster within.

I've read advice and gave advice, I've smiled with the stories that reflected mine, and got shocked by all the weird body fluids you all described.

so: to the old timers: let's keep it going.
 to the new comers: I hope you see my story as an inspiration to pull thru as I've read countless stories that made me not want to stop quitting.

Thank you. 365 times thanks.

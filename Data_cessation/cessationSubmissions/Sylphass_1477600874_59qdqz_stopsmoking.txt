Heading into Day 4 - any advice for handling anxiety?

Hey, everyone -- I'm new to this sub, quitting cold-turkey. I'm getting through, but have no idea what to expect. I made it through the first 72 hours, and the biggest challenge has been the anxiety.

Anyone else having severe anxiety and/or panic attacks during nicotine withdrawal? Is this a good time to break out the klonopin? What do I do? Halp!

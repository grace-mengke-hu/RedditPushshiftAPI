Hotel (17 days)

Imagine you were the hotel owner, the hotel is your body. You've let bunch of idiots in your hotel and they crashed and burned down things. Now the hotel is being in the state of renovation. Somehow now you're asking yourself why the hotel isn't working as good as before? But as soon as the renovation ends it will be back up working even better than before.

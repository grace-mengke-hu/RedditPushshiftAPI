100 Days

Finally made it to 100 days smoke free. 

I started smoking around 18. A few cigarettes here and there with friends. Then a few more in college. Then It went to buying a pack a semester, then a pack a month, then a pack a week. 

Then after college ended it became a pick every few days for a year.

Then I settled down for a few years. Still smoking but less. But then life changes happened and I went all in on smoking for a year. Half a pack to a pack a day. It permeated my every routine. Coffee came with a cigarette, walking came with a few cigarettes, I spent more time outside of bars than in. 

100 days ago I smoked my last cigarette. I had no intention of making quitting a big deal, just wanted to see if I could go the rest of the workweek. Then the rest of that weekend, and now I'm 100 days in. 

It's just one step at a time, a micro goal of not smoking each time you feel the urge. Each time you don't give in you get a victory. I love that I'm not longer a smoker. I'll never be a smoker again.

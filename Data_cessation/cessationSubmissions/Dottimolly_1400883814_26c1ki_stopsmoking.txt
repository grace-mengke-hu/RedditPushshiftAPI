Best generic alternative to Nicorette mini-lozenges?

I've been using Nicorette brand 4mg mini-lozenges for a while, but apparently they have either been discontinued by Nicorette, or all drug stores in my area decided to stop carrying them sometime during the past two weeks. Went to four different drug store chains last night and nobody has them anymore.

So last night I bought the [Walgreens generic version](http://www.walgreens.com/store/c/walgreens-nicotine-4mg-mint-mini-lozenges/ID=prod6148199-product), and they're okay, but they seem to have an aftertaste to them that the Nicorette brand lozenges didn't have (tastes very strongly of artificial sweetener which I don't like).

Curious if anybody w/ lots of nicotine gum/lozenge experience knows if all the generic brands (CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, etc.) are from the same manufacturer? Or does each chain have a different supplier? Is there one generic brand that is known to be better than the others?

Any information is appreciated!

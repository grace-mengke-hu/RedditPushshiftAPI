Need Your Tips and Tricks on Breaking Habits

Edit2: Thank you so much everyone for taking the time to read this and respond. Very much appreciated!!

So, the consensus seems to be that I do not need to stop taking my breaks when I get home after work, I just need to modify how I spend the time. I think I'll start gaming earlier than usual! loll Can't feel the need to hold a cigarette when both hands are busy on a controller! If that doesn't work, I guess I can start crocheting... If I get good at it I might end up with Star Wars crocheted figurines! loll

Hi /r/stopsmoking,


It hasn't even been a week yet, but I can already feel the difference... I sleep a whole lot better, this morning I realized that I was breathing better... It's been a bit rough, but feeling physically different is helping me keep my resolve.


The one spot I'm having difficulty with is the one I use to have once I got home every night. Whenever I got home after work, I would always take a 20-30 mins break before starting diner, chores, etc..., sit on the sofa, watch a bit of TV, and of course the one thing I would do when I sat down was have a smoke... I still want to take my break when I get home after work, but now I get this very intense feeling of emptiness and weirdness because I'm not smoking... Which makes what would be a relaxing moment stressful...


Because of this feeling, I've changed my routine and now get right into chores and cooking diner as soon as I get home... But I would really like to go back to having my quick break when I get home...


What are your tips and tricks to break cravings triggered by old habits?

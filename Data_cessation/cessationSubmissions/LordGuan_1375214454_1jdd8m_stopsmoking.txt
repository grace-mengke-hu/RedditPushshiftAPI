Ran out of smokes!

So I ran out almost two hours ago. Figured why not give quitting another try. Other than the normal stuff, ie drink water, chew gum, think of the kids... Any other tricks while I detox over the next 48 or so hours?

48 hours is in now way scientific, just what I have experienced in the past, after that the cravings go away and only the Pavlovian reactions need to be dealt with. 

UPDATE: almost 24Hrs, thanks

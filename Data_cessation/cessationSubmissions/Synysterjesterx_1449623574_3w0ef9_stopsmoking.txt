Wife and I quit today

We did however start vaping. 
She quit today, and myself 3 days ago. 
I can already breath better and am coughing less. 
I'm sure some of it is a placebo, but I feel fantastic! 
Seeing all of your success' and struggles made me decide to quit. 
Thanks for being such a supportive group!

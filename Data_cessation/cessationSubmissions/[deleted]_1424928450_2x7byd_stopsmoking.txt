48 hours!

I'm going crazy town on these nicotine gums, probably about 15 of them (2mg), but I haven't smoked in 48 hours so its working! I've caught myself looking for my smokes twice yesterday, but only once today.  And in the morning I really want a smoke, and kind of freaks me out.  I realized I don't smoke anymore -- but the gum calms me down.   I also switched from coffee ( a trigger) to tea. I do black tea, green tea, and then chai with almond milk during the day with nicgum instead of my regular coffee and chain smoking until 5pm. I'm going to let myself go crazy town again tomorrow on the gum and then start to taper down probably during or after day 4, as apparently my urges will peak tomorrow and the next day. But I'm looking forward to another day of clean air!  Also I'm coughing up crap and some lung butter, but I feel great and the energy is awesome.

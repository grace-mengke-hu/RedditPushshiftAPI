Do cravings return after having a bit of nicotine?

Hi Everyone, almost 3 months into my quit now but a couple of days ago a few friends were having cigars and offered me one. I said why not, I'm not inhaling it into my lungs so it should be okay. I later realized that a lot of nicotine, if not most, is absorbed through your mouth and throat.

I'm beating myself over it wishing I didn't have that 1 cigar. 

Does this mean I'm essentially starting again? Or is my body more resistant to cravings now? I'm not sure how to put this but hopefully you know what I mean. Am I starting from day 1?

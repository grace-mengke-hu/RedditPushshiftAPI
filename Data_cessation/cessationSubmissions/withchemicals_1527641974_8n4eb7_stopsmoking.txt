Am I doing okay?

10 year half pack to a pack a day smoker. I tried to quit multiple times in the past, but for the first time, I got counseling and went through many sessions before my quit day this time. They recommended low dose patches + low dose lozenges during cravings.

I am worried that maybe I am feeding my addiction, but I did the math and it seems that I am still getting significantly less nicotine than before (7mg patch + 7-8 2mg lozenges per day = 21-23mg nicotine per day). I think 21-23mg nicotine is much less than around 10 cigarettes per day, right?

I still feel a little brain fog but at least my agitation during withdrawals isn't as strong this time, so I am quite happy. I am hoping to wean off slowly once I get in the habit of just living without thinking about even smoking.

Doc said I'm all clear!

I've been worried for the last few days because my lungs are still sore. I'm also not sleeping well, my head hurts, I've just been a bit miserable. And what I've read online is that most of that should have cleared up by now. I've really been worried that it might be cancer or early emphysema.

Just came back from the doctor. He did a few tests, gave me the all-clear. Apparently, the cilia in my lungs are coming back online and that's causing the pain. They're moving again and my nerves don't remember what that feels like, so my body is interpreting it as a *bad* thing. That really freaks me out, that cigarettes have made me feel bad when my body is *trying to do what it was made to do*.

Anyway, got something to help move the phlegm along, something for the headaches and a short-acting sleeping tablet to kick-start my sleep at night. I'm feeling really motivated right now, the worst is over now. Physically, at least.

Anyway, just wanted to share with people who may understand.

IT WILL HE A MIRACLE IF I DON’T SKOKE TONIGHT

I am getting the worst cravings ever, I am on day 28 and went out to a social event and had a couple of wines.  All I thought about was having a cigarette when I got home.  My partner smokes weed every night which annoys me.  He won’t ever give up as I think he’s selfish, I feel angry and want to do what I want to do, the fact he’s still doing it makes me feel like why shouldn’t I.  It will be hard to not smoke tonight

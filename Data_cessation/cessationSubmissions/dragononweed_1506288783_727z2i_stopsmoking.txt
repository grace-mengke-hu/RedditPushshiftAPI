It's time I quit. Starting today.

Smoked my last cig hopefully at 11 in the night. I have a few methods this time to psychologically keep me motivated. 

I'm gonna count all the cigs I did not smoke. When I really had a craving and I did not pick up a ciggerette. 

I have an insane addiction of having a cig with a cup of tea. And I plan to overcome that too by going back to my normal schedule of just tea. 

I hope I get there.

Severe shortness of breath, chest tightness, throat pain

Hi friends,

I am now about 3 days free of tobacco or any nicotine-related device/substance.  I feel pretty optimistic about quitting long term, but I currently am having severe shortness of breath just from walking around campus, up stairs, getting out of bed, etc... My breathing is also notably shorter, and my chest feels tight and often has sharp pains.  I never felt any of these symptoms while smoking.  For reference, I've only been smoking regularly for about a year and a half.  At most, I was smoking 1/2 pack a day, but average across the whole 1.5 years I probably had 3-4 smokes a day.  I also smoked a decent number of tobacco-only water pipe bowls for a period of time. 

Is this discomfort I'm having any reason too worry?  I've never tried to quit before, so I do not know what its like. I am young, 19 years old.  Are these simply withdrawal discomforts?

Thanks for any and all help

78 hours smoke-free

Thanks for all the help y'all left in the comments on my last post. It's really been helping. I had my last "beer  'moke" at 6:00am on Sunday. Not one drop of alcohol nor bit of nicotine since. The hardest part of these cravings is not being able to tell if they're for the alcohol or the nicotine.

I really feel like I can quit for good this time.

I miss them so much!

I smoked 20 a day for about 15 years. I quit smoking last November. It was on a whim and I did it cold turkey. 
I still can't believe I have lasted so long; I think I owe it to being so stubborn. I'm super proud of myself but I still miss them every day!!! 
Someone told me that this feeling never leaves, anyone disagree?

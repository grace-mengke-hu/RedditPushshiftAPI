Almost a year

This time last year, I was still smoking, and I would never have thought that I'd be a non smoker the following holiday season. So many factors attributed to my being able to keep it going, from those who I worked with who told me I would fail at my attempt to words of encouragement from my dad who quit 10 years ago. It also helped having the badge on this subreddit, when I thought about smoking, I thought about my badge, and how if I take just one drag on a cigarette and that resets my progress, and it'd be like starting back at day one, that curbed the current craving I was having. It's been a pretty successful year for me in this regard, and 2017 is only gonna get better, so everyone from those just starting their quit to the ones with years under their belt, stay strong and stay smoke free!

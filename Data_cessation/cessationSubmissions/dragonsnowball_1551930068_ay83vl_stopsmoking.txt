Addiction is the Worst

I've noticed my reasons for quitting have evolved. At first it was generic things that people tell you like I want to smell better, I don't want to get lung cancer, I want to save money. I knew I wanted to quit but I didn't really know why. Not really. 

I'm 5 months in now. I relapsed for a month and a half but I stopped again 2 weeks ago. The first week I coasted through and I guess I expected it to keep being that easy. Boy was I wrong. It makes you feel like someone with split personalities. Two weeks ago I was so done with cigarettes you could stick a fork in me. Then the cravings started to come back. I stopped myself from giving in as long as I could but I haven't been completely successful at this quit either. It's so frustrating. 

Right now I am 5 hours smoke free and I'm just trying to stay strong! I know I can beat this. I know I can. I just didn't expect it to be this bad. Damn. 

Addiction is so loud and hard to ignore. You tell it to stfu but it's still there. GET OUT OF MY LIFE FOR GOOD. See, I can shout back.

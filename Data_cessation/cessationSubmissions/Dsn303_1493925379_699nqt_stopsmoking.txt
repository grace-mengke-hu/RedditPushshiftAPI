NRT / cold turkey question

So I quit over 3 weeks ago, I consider myself a non-smoker and this time I feel very confident. But...
 I use 21mg patches from the morning to the evening (couldn't sleep with patches, still can't even without...) and 2mg lozenges or nicorette quick mist to repress cravings. I'm a bit worried it's going to end up as nrt addiction ( I feel it happened during my not successful quitting 2 years ago). I'd like to try kind of cold turkey method and stop using NRT but I'm afraid I may be too weak to do it at this stage. And as a female I'm worried I'll start eating like crazy and gain weight... 
Anyone had similar situation and could give me some advices/tips, please?

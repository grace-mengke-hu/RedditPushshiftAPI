Day 15 of chantix - final review of chantix

I’ve been on chantix for two weeks and a day now and I’d say I have a pretty good vibe for it. So I’ll give my final rundown of chantix for anyone thinking about taking it to help them quit smoking...

I quit 5 days ago, on day 11 or 12 of chantix, partly by choice and partly because they just weren’t satisfying me anymore. I do have cravings but they’re not bad, they’re manageable and sometimes they’re so slight I barely notice, which has been nice. Going through withdrawal without being a complete nightmare bitch has been so great. I DO want a cigarette but when I actually think about smoking, it’s almost not enough to actually want to smoke one. It kind of makes me nauseous. 

Side effects: 
So obviously if you’ve heard of chantix, you’ve probably heard of the crazy side effects it can have, which made me super hesitant to take and kind of got nervous due to my history of anxiety and depression. 
To my surprise, I had almost no psychiatric side effects - no hallucinations, no paranoia, no depression, no aggression, not even agitation, which is a common side effect. 
The only side effects I notice are the seriously CRAZY dreams this stuff gives you, I mean, seriously crazy. Super vivid. A few night terrors but i have crazy dreams to begin with so it didn’t surprise me. The other side effect I noticed when I started the 2nd week of chantix, which was nausea after taking the second pill of the day (I’m nauseous as I type right now) but if I eat, it goes away. 

I’m also getting my sense of smell and taste back which has been interesting! 

All in all, I’m SUPER impressed with this drug, but I also would advise extreme caution when taking it, I had my boyfriend keep an eye on me to make sure I didn’t have any crazy personality changes, became aggressive, paranoid, etc. 
if you decide to take chantix, have someone monitor you closely, and take it day by day. 

Thanks all for listening. Hopefully this helps.

1 year 2 months 5 days - this past week have been getting crazy cravings, but holding on so far!

So I quit over a year ago, in that time I had a drag, just one during a drunken moment at a wedding. Other than that I've never really craved or wanted cigarettes except a very occasional craving once in a while that passes in a minute.

These past week or two however, damn. I'm really stressed and anxious right now, and I just want to smoke as I used to. In my mind somehow it will be a relief, but I know it won't. The only thing holding me back is knowing that I've managed over a year of not smoking, and that I would throw all that away for a few days of weakness. It's freaking though, but I'm gonna hold on.

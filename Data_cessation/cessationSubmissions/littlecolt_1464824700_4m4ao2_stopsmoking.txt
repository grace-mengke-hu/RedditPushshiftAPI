Longest I've been nicotine-free in almost 10 years. It does get easier!

I wanted to share an image from my Smoke Free app, with cravings and severity. I started Smoke Free on the 22nd when I quit my ecig. My last cigarette was 14 days ago on the 18th.

Gotta tell you, don't worry if you're having cravings! Just power through them like a badass. I haven't had a craving in a couple days now. Here's the pic: [Chart](http://puu.sh/pdlSF/102247fe83.png)

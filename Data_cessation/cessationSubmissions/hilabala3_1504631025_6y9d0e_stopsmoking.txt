Best stop smoking apps?

So like many I've tried to stop smoking a few times but haven't had success and feel like it's because I haven't taken it seriously.  I few things have happened lately motivating me to try again but I'm scared ! So i joined this group.  

After reading some posts I see that some people have found it helpful to use an app ... sooo I am wondering what apps people out there have found the best/most helpful/worth buying or downloading ?

Thanks!

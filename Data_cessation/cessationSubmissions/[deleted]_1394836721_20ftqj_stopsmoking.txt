Trying to quit AGAIN (after legitimately quitting before)

I started smoking when I was 17. Once I hit 18 I smoked a pack a day for 5 years. I then quit for a year and a half...until at around this time last year I got cocky and started back up. I didn't think anything of it at first because I would make a pack last a week. Now I'm back at a pack a day again. I'm realizing it's much harder to quit this time around. Has anybody else been in a similar situation? How did you quit the second time?

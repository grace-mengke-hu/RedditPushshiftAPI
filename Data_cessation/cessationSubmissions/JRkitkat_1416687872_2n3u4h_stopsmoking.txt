3 weeks my story so far!

Hi all,
I have been reading all your posts since day 10 when my smokefree app introduced me to this page! And each and every day I read all your posts!
I have tried many many times to stop smoking and only once I  have had a feeling of truly being free, 2 years ago, and I was free for 4 months!!! But I let it creep back in, as I've worked out it CAN control your mind if you let it!
So I tried again as I missed the feeling of breathing, smelling, tasting, no more clock watching (waiting to go for a cig) and enjoying a bit of extra cash (always a bonus).
Week 1 was great NO cravings feeling good happy with my quit, myself and my method (patches)
Week 2 was great however I had two days of me being grumpy, mind over matter I had to wobble my head find out what was the root cause.... No chill time as I was keeping myself so occupied I wasn't resting or sleeping to well, so popped a bit of me time in and grumpy me disappeared!
Week 3 over all great except for yesterday I could have eaten a packet of cigs, I though about going to the shop, I worked how I could get into my mums house and take just one.. Those thoughts were with me ALL day, I went for a long walk and worked out would it change anything????NO by last night in bed I was proud of myself that I didn't do it!!!
Each day, each hour, each post I read helps!
Thought I would share and it will be sharing ing another 3 weeks time!

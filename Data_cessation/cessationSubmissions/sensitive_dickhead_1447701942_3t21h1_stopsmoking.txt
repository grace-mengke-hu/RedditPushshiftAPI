And you know what? It was easy.

I told myself for so long that it was gonna be hard, which is what made it hard. Making the decision was the toughest part- I almost never made it, it was almost made for me. I realized that it was the only right decision and that I had to do it. I can't function smoking a pack of cigarettes a day. I can't smoke less than a pack of cigarettes a day. So the only answer is to not smoke even one cigarette ever again.

Part of me wants one now and again- yet none of me wants one ever again. Once I made the decision to quit, it's been easy. Withdrawal has been almost nonexistent (thanks to the fact that I was already sick) and as long as you recognize that cravings are just feelings, just temporary little feelings, they become easy to accept and move past. 

Will I ever smoke a cigarette again? Maybe. But today I'm not going to have one. Today I don't want one. If tomorrow morning I wake up and decide I want to ruin my quality of life, I'll cross that bridge when I get there.

But I'm not stupid. Not anymore.

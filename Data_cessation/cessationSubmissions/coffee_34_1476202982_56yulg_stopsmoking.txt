I'm quitting today. Quick question, will my skin go back to normal?

I started coughing like crazy. It hurts so bad and I can't breathe. 

I'm ready to be free from smoking.

Quick question: I've been smoking pack a day for 5 years. I'm 22 and I already have disgusting crows feet whenever I smile. I also have wrinkles around my mouth, yellow teeth, and my skin just looks bad.

Will it go back to normal or is the damage done? Not as worried about the teeth since I can get them whitened, but my skin is gross.

Where do I start?

I’m very young, 23 years old and I’ve been smoking near a pack a day for about a year. Before that I smoked maybe a pack every other day or two days since I was 17. 

It’s such a habit, smoking a cigarette every time I drive somewhere or smoking when I’m drinking with buddies. Smoking a cigarette when I get stressed out I don’t even know what to do without them. 

I know it’ll be worth it in the end but it just seems impossible at the moment.

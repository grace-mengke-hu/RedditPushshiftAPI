First day of the rest of my life.

So I'm starting over again. I was able to quit for a year, but I've ultimately been a smoker for ten years.

What are a few things you long time quitters told yourselves in that first hellish week?

I need some ammo, and repeating to myself that I don't need cigarettes, I fear, may only last so long.

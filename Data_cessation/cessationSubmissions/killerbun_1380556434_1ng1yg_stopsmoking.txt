Quitting smoking and night sweats

I recently was so sick that I was unable to smoke. I thought "well this is a good time to quit smoking so Ill just stick with it." Then on day 2 came the night sweats. I would sleep 20 minutes wake up drenched, have to shower, then wait an hour before I could get back to sleep. The cycle would just repeat itself all night, and ever day following. I did this for 1.5 weeks until I was just so dehydrated I had to go get fluids put in me. I decided to pick back up because I couldnt take it. I turn 25 this october and I am exhausted from smoking. I have read The easy way to quit smoking. I want to quit so terribly bad and get healthy. But the nightsweats have me to where I can barely do anything throughout the day for dehydration and lack of sleep. I am new to posting and I am not sure if I did this correctly but I desperately need some help in achieving my goal of quitting.

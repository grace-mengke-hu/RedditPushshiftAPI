Day 2 (thoughts on hookah?)

I got into smoking hookah a while back and bought one to enjoy on random evenings. I never used it often but being on my second day without cigarettes I keep noticing it. I feel like the act of smoking would feel really good and shisha has next to no / no nicotine in it. Thoughts?

First Day

I had my last coffin nail at 8:15am PST and I have decided that I am going to go cold turkey. The Nicotrol Inhaler, gum and lozenges make me severely sick and nauseous due to the method of nicotine delivery, the patch I am allergic to the adhesive, and chantix I have suicidal ideation. However I am on Wellbutrin SR and that's a non nicotine aid and I have a lot of support. I am also  taking a smoking cessation class In December. Quitting is possible if you are motivated and if you have a set plan In place and put it in use. Wish me luck

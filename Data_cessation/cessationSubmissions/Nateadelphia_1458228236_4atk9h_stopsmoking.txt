I finally picked up "The Book" on Audible to listen to in the car to/from work. What should I expect?

I've been a smoker now for about 7 years. It's weird for me to even write that-- I started at age 23, way beyond any reasonable time to start. I've had a series of spectacular failures at trying to quit, the most recent being a getaway vacation last weekend which resulted in me smoking and taking out the blowout aggression on my girlfriend, who had planned the trip. I've also been attending acupuncture lately as well. My therapist gave me the "opiates level detox" this past week, and while the first day I legitimately felt "sick" after smoking a few, I'm right back at it, between half a pack and a full pack daily.
  
What should I expect from this book? Am I missing anything by going the audio book route? This is likely the most effective way for me to hear the message. I've owned the hardcopy for a few years now, and the self-righteous introduction turns me off every time I make an attempt to start it. I also just don't have the free time or attention span to burn through the book in a couple of sittings. I have about an hour commute to/from work, so I should finish this by early next week, I figure.  
  
Your thoughts are much appreciated!

118 days

So it's been (I think) 113 days since I posted here last and 118 days since I quit smoking.

I moved on to e cigs for around 2 weeks and got caught out twice while drinking as my e cig battery ran out so had 2 cigs in that time. They both made me feel like shit!

Haven't touched one since, been tempted a couple of times but no more than a craving and not as bad as previous times that I've quit.

I've noticed, more over the last month, that I'm thinking about smoking a lot less. I feel like I've broken the habit,
I no longer sit looking at the clock thinking, I would have a smoke about now etc

Just thought I would ramble on about it here and hopefully give someone a bit of a boost if they're planning on quitting, it wasn't as hard as I thought it was gona be!!!

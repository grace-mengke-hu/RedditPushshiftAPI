Somehow I was able to make it this far cold turkey. Although, this last weekend I went to my cousins house and I wanted to smoke so bad! Her and I always used to sit outside and talk and smoke.   

Then I go to see her for the first time in forever and she steps out to smoke and I went with her and my cravings were outrageous. I am surprised that I didn't ask her for one... I doubt she would have given me one though, lol I had told her that I quit.   

Anyways, I made it through though. I just got to get through this. :D

Two and a half months and about to break.

I've been cigarette free for 2 months, 22 days, and 2 hours (according to QuitIt) but lately I've been having really intense cravings. On nights like this when I'm up all night by myself doing work or studying for finals I find myself getting closer and closer to buying a pack just to get through the next few weeks. 

I know that I can't have "just one", that they won't actually make me less stressed, and that no mental gymnastics to justify smoking make it worth it, but I want one anyways. Usually I just tell myself to take it hour by hour, day by day, but that's not working as well as it used to. What really doesn't help is that the reason I finally felt motivated enough to quit was for a girl I had feelings for, and am now trying to move on from. So often when I try to remind myself why I quit I end up thinking about her, which makes me feel stressed (or just shitty), which then makes me crave a cigarette. 


I don't actually know why I'm posting this, I think I just needed to say it out loud (reddit will suffice until my friends wake up). I'm going to make it through tonight, but my resolve has been getting weaker and weaker so I'm afraid that I'm going to relapse some time soon. Sorry for the sob story, I know many of you are much worse off than me, but I just needed to get this off my chest.

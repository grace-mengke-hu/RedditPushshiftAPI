I need to quit!!! Advice appreciated...

I have been trying to quit smoking on and off for 3 or 4 years now, I have probably been smoking about 5-7 years in total. I smoke very erratically, some days none or one cigarette, other days 20-30. I'm 21/F.

I have numerous medical conditions (including.... Type 1 Diabetes, Asthma, Severe Anxiety, Derealisation, ADHD and others) and I know that I need to quit. I do not judge myself or others for smoking at all but I do want to quit to better my health..

Here are a few of my challenges:

* Health care professionals are being judgemental/not understanding when I do tell them I smoke. I have asked for support in quitting smoking numerous times from different doctors but I haven't been supported yet or offered anything other than a pack of booklets.

* I live alone, and do not have many people to support me.

* I can't afford the nicotine replacements as I have been off sick for quite a while!

* When I quit cold turkey, I usually end up in a frenzy and I cannot find another suitable alternative that I can do by myself to be able to calm down in a crisis.

* I have very speedy/multiple streams of mental chatter and find it hard to look objectively at myself/the situation.

* I already feel very guilty about the fact that I smoke, I don't like the smell etc.

* Smoking is currently my only real escape - I have tried and tested hundreds if not thousands of alternative things over the years. I am very open to trying new ideas. It is definitely something to do with the nicotine rush. 

* I find it hard to use apps/books which require sustained concentration. I'm not sure if there's any simpler methods of tracking?

* I'm not sure how to find my motivation. It isn't coming from my health, or goal setting (limit number a day, reduce over time).

I REALLY want to quit! Any good tips?

**Thanks in advance :)**

If I don't stop smoking I WILL die

I was just released from a 2 day stay in the hospital. In 2016, I had RNY surgery. That's weight loss surgery where they cut your stomach in half. I'm a 37 year old female. I went from a size 24 to a size 12 in kids. I lost WAY too much weight! I'm at a dangerous level and what's left of my stomach is filled with ulcers. In addition to it being extremely painful, it will kill me. They are caused by me smoking. The doctor said I literally am fighting for my life and I CANNOT smoke. I successfully quit for 2 years once before using Chantix. I can't take them this time because Chantix is known to aggravate ulcers. It's cold turkey for me. And it's my life on the line. I got this.

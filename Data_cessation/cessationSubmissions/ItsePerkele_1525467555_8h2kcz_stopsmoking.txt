Today, on May 5th 2018, I've decided to quit smoking

It is time. My coughing and rising loss of breath have started to become bothersome. And ever since I started smoking(18) I've become more and more anxious, symptoms like shaking, headshaking especially has become a nuisance. I've also started blushing more. **I dont know if this is because of smoking, is this possible?** Anyway, I will give quit now and see if it helps with my anxiety also. 

It helped that when my wisdom tooth was removed weeks ago and I couldnt smoke, in just a few days I could already see what it was like to be smokeless. First thing I noticed was that food tasted way better and I could smell better. I breathed better and overall mood was better. Now lets see how much better things are when I quit for life.

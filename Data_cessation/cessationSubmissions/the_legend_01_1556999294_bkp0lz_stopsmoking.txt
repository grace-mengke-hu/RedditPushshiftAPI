Help! I think I'm slowly getting addicted to smoking!

Well, the title says it all. Recently, I've found myself smoking cigarettes more often. I used to be a non-smoker a few months ago, but when I met an old friend from college, he insisted me to smoke (I had tried out a few with him during my college days).  
You see, I've always thought of smoking as a disgusting habit. I used to loathe the people who did it, and felt glad that I was not a smoker. But since that incident, I have found myself sharing smokes with my roommates too, when we play Counter Strike and during parties. Now, I don't smoke alone, only when I'm in groups and not more than 2-3 smokes shared between 2-3 people, including myself. I usually do this 3-4 days a week. Actually, I'm still sharing a smoke with my mates right now as I type this.   
And you know what, I don't want this. I hate what I am becoming. I don't want to do this anymore but I find myself lacking resistance when offered a smoke by my friends. I know smoking is bad and the effects it will have on my health.   
Can someone please talk me through this, someone who has been in my shoes and help me find a way out of this. I will be glad if somebody helped me through this. Thanks!

Angry at people that talk about quitting

I'm nearly a month clean...could not be more proud of myself.  So. Fucking. Happy.

I'm finding myself super aggravated, even angry, at people that aren't following through with commitments and taking care of business they have the obligation to.

In my mind I am often saying: You're wasting my fucking time and I'm sick of it. Fuck off.

Of course, I tried to quit a million times and said it just as many...

I'm glad I gave cold turkey a go

I'm at a very early stage of my quit still so it's obviously still too soon to say the method is working, but from what I gather, the worst of the physical withdrawal has passed, and it was not *nearly* as bad as I thought it would be... it was surprisingly similar to how week one felt with a nicotine patch. I've been taking it easy and sipping cranberry juice, watching videos on quitting, and stretching.

 I just want to say I'm the kind of person who thought cold turkey wouldn't work for them - not in a million years. I'm a very heavy smoker (>2 ppd), very adverse to physical discomfort, and someone with a very low sense of will power and/or discipline. So I never thought I'd be a good candidate.

But NRT did drag the pain for longer.. I'd feel vulnerable every time I lowered the dose on my patch, for instance, or every time I tried to cut down on the gum. I also realised part of me felt I had a safety net if I relapsed because I'd just go back to a stronger nicotine dosage for a few days, and then lower it again.

So yeah, I know everyone's different, and if NRT helps then do what you feel you must, but I was really scared of giving up nicotine altogether and now I'm glad I gave it a go. The infamous 72 hours of peak withdrawal were hard, but not as hard as I thought. We'll see how it goes from here :)

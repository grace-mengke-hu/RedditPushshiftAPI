Day 1, 24 hours since a wake up call at the ER

Hello, im 39 years old and have been smoking for about 22 years and I've tried to quit smoking for years. I have been on and the patch for the last 7 years. Two weeks ago I came down with a head cold. Last week I got a sore throat that went away but I developed a lingering cough the last four days. I figured I had a chest cold that turned into a chest infection. 

Dr did his examination and now I have to schedule an appointment for a breathing test. Could be copd, asthma, or nothing at all but he didn't like the wheezing. He wants me to wait for my wheezing to clear up but Im fucking scared. I fucked up good.

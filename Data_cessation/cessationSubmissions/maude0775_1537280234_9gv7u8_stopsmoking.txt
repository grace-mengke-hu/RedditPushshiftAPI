single cigarette temptation!

Quit for 8 months and then started again because I'm an idiot. After 5 months of smoking, I have been quitting every morning this week but slipping during the day once the cravings get a bit strong. A big problem is that I live in Mexico where I can go down the street and buy 1 cigarette for 5 pesos. My stubborn, addicted brain justifies this as an option because "I'm not buying a pack". Any tips on how to reason/distract myself out of this dumb justification? I want to get through 3 days totally smoke free so I can prove to myself I can do it again.

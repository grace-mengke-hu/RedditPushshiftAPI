Quick tips from an ex...

It's been over 7 years with zero cheats from a long term "pack a day" guy...

I see some talking "day X ...."  Do yourself a favor and don't thing about "day X"  it'll drive you nuts.

I listened to the Alan Carr book and it was the critical point in helping.  The logic behind how quickly the effects leave your body is VERY important to fully understand.
IIRC, it's about 20 min for most of the effect to leave your body, therefore your body has almost fully quit after an hour.

The other "trick" I did was I didn't finish the last pack.  When you only have a few left, you go to the store, if you have 1/2 a pack, you don't need to go to the store.  I quit with about 1/2 a pack left and I never bought another pack.  Don't smoke the last 1/2 pack, just leave it somewhere.

The habit thing... make it so that it's harder and harder to do something.  I gave up video games by making it only work on another boot drive, I have to remove drives and reboot the computer... it's not worth it, so I only play a few times a year.

Make smoking just like that, you have to work so hard to smoke, that's it's just not worth it.

I can tell you that the effect is huge, you fell 10X better after about 6 months.

Best of luck and I hope I've helped someone.  Don't focus on the "OMG it's been X amount of time..."  that'll just drive you crazy.

One last tip.  I was watching a documentary about focusing the brain.  They pointed out the you seeing that you're brain is not sharply focused on the topic is normal for people to keep themselves sharply focused.  The point is that you have to keep reminding yourself to stay focused, getting involved in other activities helps.

Dificult keeping my mind busy

Ive been using nicotine patches(21mg) for almost a month but whenever i get bored i have to smoke, sometimes I don't have a choice to do something else and it wont go off my mind, what the veterans can say to shed some light on this issue.

Anyway i reduced from a pack a day if not more to at maximum 6 or 7 cigarettes per day and that is a great victory for me cus less smoke=more money :D

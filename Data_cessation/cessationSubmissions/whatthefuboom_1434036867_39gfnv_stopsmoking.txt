Friday, I will smoke my last cigarette.

I know I can do it. I'm sure. 

I'm 20 years old. Been smoking regularly (every day) for a little over two years, when I got this summer job at a box factory. I already smoked on and off at that point, bumming cigs from friends or buying the occasional pack for shits and giggles. When I worked there, I decided to start smoking because, well, I had more disposable income than I did with previous jobs, amd it gave me something to do during breaks. 

I smoke often with my closest friend. When we chill, we smoke, amongst other things. I like smoking. I still enjoy it. He has been smoking for over four years I believe, and is starting to dislike it. Yesterday, he said that he will stop before leaving on a family trip next month. I told him: "Fuck it, we're stopping ASAP. We set a date, we quit together, we smoke our last one together". That date is Friday.

It sucks, in a way, because, as I said, I still enjoy smoking, especially on my breaks at work, for example. Since getting into university the fall after I started smoking, I met new people via smoking. A lot of new people. I like the social aspect but the health and monetary benefits far outweigh the social part. 

This will be hard, but I think that I can do it. 

Wish me luck. 

EDIT: Why does my flair say 1 day if I told the bot that the start date was friday? Lol

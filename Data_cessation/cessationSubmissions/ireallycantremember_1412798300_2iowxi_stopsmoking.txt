Two ENTIRE years. If I can quit, so can you.

For everyone out there thinking "i can't do it," you are WRONG. I have zero willpower, and I was able to quit and stay quit after smoking for 18+ years. 

You don't realize that its actually easy to stop smoking, and it blows my mind how gross smoking is... Its gross smelling, the act of of its gross, and the cost to your wallet and health are the grossest of all. 

I'm proud of myself, and I'm proud of everyone else on here.  If you need motivation to quit, look within yourself, and make choice to do it. Or, just listen to me, QUIT ALREADY!!

"Advantages"?

We often think of whatever good things happen to us when we quit, like breathing easier, having more cash in our wallets, or reducing the risk of contracting lung cancer, we think of them as "advantages" or "perks". But I find that hypocritical, misleading or simply fallacious. I'm not, of course, criticizing any individuals, but rather the practice itself. Allow me to expand on my point. 

Imagine if ten people, who you never met in your life and probably will never meet, go everyday to a secluded place, brandish whips, and proceed to whip each other's backs. They think they derive benefits from it, somehow. They're addicted to this, and they do it every day. Downsides include lost time, lost effort, and a red, bloody back. *You* don't do that. Would you say that not having a red, bloody back is a "perk" of not being a back-whipping person? I wouldn't. The reason is simple: The default situation of a human being is (not getting whipped). When someone chooses to get whipped, they're changing the default situation. That's why we need to label the result of that action, with either a favorable or a depreciative term - a "downside" or a "disadvantage" in this case. "Perk" is what we would choose, if the person in question was instead taking a special fitness course to sculpt their body *beyond the default human condition*. 

So to sum it up, I think we don't get any "advantages" when we quit. We just revert back to the "default" situation. Which is great, because when we smoke, we deviate from that default, by putting ourselves in a pretty nasty situation (even nastier, I might say, than that of the back-whippers). Thus, going back to the default is an excellent achievement, one of which we should be proud, and not smother it with pretensions to "perks".

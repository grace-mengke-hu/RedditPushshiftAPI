Day 7. Doing ok, I think the patch is helping

Currently on a train from France to Barcelona in the midst of a 3 week vacation with my fiancee. I figured why not quit when I have to spend an entire day on a plane or in airports/on trains when I can't smoke anyway. What I didn't count on is that the national pastime of France is chain smoking.  That sweet smell is everywhere.  Hopefully that will turn to disgust soon.

Been using the patch daily and I think its helping, I haven't had too many god awful cravings, but the urge to smoke is still there, but manageable.  I also have the gum as a backup if it gets too bad.  I don't much care for the gum as it gives me a throat-burning sensation and pretty bad cottonmouth. 

Also, what I've heard about weird dreams on the patch is correct.  The other night I had a dream that I was in the movie Mystic Pizza. I've never seen Mystic Pizza. 

Anyway, good luck everyone.  Keep fighting the good fight.

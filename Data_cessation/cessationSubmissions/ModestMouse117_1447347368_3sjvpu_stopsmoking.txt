Morale is broken

Im losing my morale here. After smoking rather regularly til I was physically sick for a good year I quit cold turkey last sunday vowing never to touch them again. Im not getting any cravings as I still remember how sick cigarettes made me feel when I was on them. Absolutely 0 cravings. But I cant sleep at night. I am exhausted but always end up wakiing up at like 4 or 5 am and I wake uip with heavy dark circles like Ive been taking drugs the night prior. Not only that my thighs and ass are getting bigger, my face puffier and my skin is drier. I feel so unsexy and my self esteem is gone because of this. My sinus seems filled constantly and my sheets are sweat laden in the morning. I feel so disgusting and ugly and its only been a few days since I quit smoking. My morale and self esteem is broken right now.

TLDR: Cant sleep, getting fat, getting ugly, no self esteem

Wanting to quit while working in the food service industry

Some sneaking out when it's slow for five minutes is a slice of heaven. I've been trying not to go out during my shifts so my tables don't smell me. But when my last table pays I can't wait to go out. After it's been really busy I feel the urge. I find when I'm home I won't smoke as much maybe it's work stress.

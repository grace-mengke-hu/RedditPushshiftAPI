Day 4, A Comment and a Question

I've quit smoking a few times before. I've been smoking for seven years, which is a number that, frankly, surprises me. It goes pretty fast once you go from a cigarette at a party to a pack in a day. When I got pregnant two years ago, I quit through the whole pregnancy and for six months after, but I picked it up again. All my old triggers came into play and some new stresses were present. But I quit this Sunday, and I'll be back to say again that I've been successful for a week. And then two weeks. And then three. And eventually I'll say, it's been seven years since I QUIT smoking. I wrote this yesterday and couldn't post, but I have since thought of a question. I am a singer, but I've noticed since I quit smoking I can't stay in tune. Will this stop once my vocal chords quit trying to compensate?

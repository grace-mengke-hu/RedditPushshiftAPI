Side effects

So I’ve never suffered any side effects from giving up smoking before except cravings. I think I’ve finally discovered the smokers flu, not had before I think because I was using nrt, now 24hrs nicotine free and feeling like shit! Don’t worry, I’m sticking by my guns there’s no way I’m smoking, just very eye opening what that shit does to you

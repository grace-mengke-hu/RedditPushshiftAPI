Scared! =/

Going on holiday soon and my mums family is being very non-supportive because everyone in the family smokes (not one person in MY family or my extended family does not smoke, all of them smoke) It's like a family tradition(!) anywho, they are making remarks like they will make me smoke again, etc. think it is all a joke. 

Â 

It's annoying and scary and I'm at day 25 and feel worse than day 1 -10 =( I've also had like 3 panic attacks since I've quit smoking, its horrible.

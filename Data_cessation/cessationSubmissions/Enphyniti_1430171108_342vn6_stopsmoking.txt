At 42 days. Feels like I've had a cold for a week or more.

Am I sick?  I haven't had a non-smoker cold in 20 years.  I've had a light cough and 'stuff' draining in the back of my throat for about 10 days now.  And deep in my throat, it's a bit... rough?  Not sore, but... grungy.  Almost like hoarseness.  That and my sinuses feel abnormally dry.

Is this what colds feel like when you're not smoking?  At around 10 days it seems like I should consider seeing a doctor.  Unless it's just my body purging all the gunk.  I don't know. Maybe I'll wait a few more days to see what happens.  Has anyone else gone through an extended "cold-like" period after being off for a few weeks?

edit: 37 days.  miscounted my hash marks.

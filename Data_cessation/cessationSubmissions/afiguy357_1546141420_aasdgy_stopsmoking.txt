How to get the most out of the Smoke free app?

Made the decision tonight that I was gonna quit smoking. Found this sub, downloaded the app because of how many other people here were using it. I bought the 4.99 version. Is there any benefit to having the .99/week version?

Anyway, my main question is how to maximize the usefulness of the app? Would love input from people just getting started and hardened vets. 

Thanks!

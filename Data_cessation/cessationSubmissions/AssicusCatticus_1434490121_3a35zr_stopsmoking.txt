Don't Get Smug!

I've been without cigarettes for 385 days, and when my (still smoking) family came to visit last week, I was hit with really bad cravings.  I was talking to a lady earlier and she pulled out a cigarette and I wanted so badly to ask her for one.

Even after a whole year, those fucking nasty things still have power.  

There's a half-smoked butt in an ashtray outside on the porch from my family being here, and I have to get up right now and go destroy it, or I'm going to end up smoking it.  I thought I had this pretty much beat.  I'm sad to be struggling so much when I was doing so well. 

On edit: I emptied out all the ashtrays they used, and made any butts into confetti before they went into the trash.  Fuck you, smoking.  Fuck you, addiction.  Why was I ever stupid enough to get started on this shit?

Gah!

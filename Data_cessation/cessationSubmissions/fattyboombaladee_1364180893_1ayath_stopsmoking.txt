Checking in on day 75!  Keep going!  it gets so much easier.

my recipe for success has been a cell phone app, working out, and the book (what is it about that thing?  it's written terribly, but is like some kind of magic.  All i'm dealing with now is a pang, maybe once a week that really isn't that bad at all.  boredom has been my only enemy.  you can do it!

One addiction for another

So you stop smoking cigs, maybe you substitute with vaping.  Still addicted to nicotine.  Or maybe it's weed.  Possibly you drink more.  I've been through all of these in my multiple attempts to quit.  One habit for another.  This time it's been video games, and I'm realizing I just have an addictive personality. I just stayed at the office late and spammed League of Legends for 6 hours, and it's a different kind of shitbag I feel like, and something I should stop cold turkey as well. Get a badge over at r/stopvideogames and start there as well.  I know what I am at least.  But what I want to know from everyone else is what do you substitute smoking with when you quit? Can you relate.

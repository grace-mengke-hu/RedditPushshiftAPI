How do you deal with the cravings?

Today is day three for me. 

I feel so strong and so committed, alas, I know myself. I've been here before. 

I've been working out (no stranger to the gym anyway) and staying super busy. I've been reading this forum. I've been listening to Allen Carr anytime I get a break (http://youtu.be/ig_6AtF9pTs). I've been eating like crazy and drinking loads of water.  I've got chewing gum placed all around the house and car.

What else might I do to remain on track?  What have you found to work really well to stop or pacify the cravings?

Many thanks!

Friend is coming over tomorrow to try to quit smoking cold turkey. How can I help him deal with his urges?

Hey everyone, I just discovered this community and I think it's awesome!

I have a friend who wants to quit smoking, but he can't resist the urge to buy cigarettes. He will be staying over at my apartment for a few days starting tomorrow so I can help him quit. I'll be holding onto his car keys, but I want to do more to help him out for his first few days.

What can I do to make this a bit less difficult for him? Are there different foods or activities or anything that will make it easier? I have never smoked before, so I don't know what it's like. If it helps, he's been smoking regularly for about four years, but I don't know how many packs a day/week.

I quit yesterday

And I woke up today with really, really strong cravings. Coffee and mornings are my trigger. Ive been smoking for 16 years and coffee is very tied for me with smoking. 

Im using the 4 mg Nicorette losenges because they helped before. I was quit for three months and when I thought I was safe, some major stress happened and I failed. 

I just need to make it through this morning.

Day 1 of quitting

Well my last cigarette was last night, around 11pm. I haven't had one all day. I don't feel the need to smoke but I do feel like someone is kneeling on my chest and that I could puke at any minute. I am assuming that these are normal withdrawal symptoms. 

I have been smoking for 22 years, roughly a pack a day. 

This has been the biggest and most terrifying decision I have ever made.

Thanks for listening!

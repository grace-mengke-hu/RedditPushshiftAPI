I'm gonna try checking in every day this time.

Me? Same old, hundreds of last cigarettes. Gone weeks before, sometimes months in the last six or seven years (not including the on and off here or there smoking from pre-ad/ early high school years). I kept a journal for an addiction project in class and it worked for the span of the assignment, which was five days, and about two weeks afterwards without the journal and a few relapses. This was relatively recently. I could yammer on but there is plenty of time to talk about me later. In short I'm just looking for a place to spray some thoughts as I go about this attempt. We'll see what happens.

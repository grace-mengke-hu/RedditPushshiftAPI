Getting back to trying

I'm an on-again off-again smoker, but when I'm 'on', I make up for lost time. I'm sure most of you are familiar with this version of the vicious cycle - quit cold turkey for a few days to a few weeks, start again and smoke HEAVILY for a few days over a weekend in some weird quest to 'get them all in before quitting again', then wrestle yourself mentally back into quitting for awhile. Repeat ad infinitum.

Anyway, for a long while there I stopped resetting my badge and just sort resigned myself to the cycle. I stopped trusting my will / discipline. I felt like the badge concept had lost its power and what was the point if I was just going to keep resetting all the time. This weekend's smoking foray got me back to thinking of the advice I always give other people, which is to AT THE VERY LEAST not stop trying. Just keep picking yourself up and getting started again, doing your best to learn from experience.

So, I'm back again and feel ready to give it my best shot. It doesn't matter that I've said it before - if I'm ever going to stop permanently, its going to start with making this decision and trying my best to stick to it. As a bonus add-on to what is mostly just your standard 'today is the day!' proclamation, here are some of the things that run through my head that resonate with me and actually help when I'm wrestling with quitting:

- Everyone's doctor tells them to quit smoking if they own up to being a smoker in the office, but I once saw a new doc for the first time who said to me something along the lines of, "the badness of smoking exceeds the goodness of all the good things you do for your health in life". As someone who puts a lot of effort into my health and well-being (apart from the smoking, of course), this struck a chord with me.

- I remember once being outside a bar towards the end of a night out. I was smoking with some friends when someone came over to chat. I offered her a smoke. She was drunk and took a looong look at the cigarette, then just said "no... can't go back to smokes". Watching her have that mental battle and the way she said it just made me feel the weight of what it means to be trapped in the addiction and how not going back there is so much more important that the passing temptation to 'why not just have one'. I was inspired by her struggle and her ability to do the exact thing you have to do in those situations despite the difficulty and I think of that moment often when I'm faced with the choice myself.

- Allen Carr and all the other resources I've read that have taught me about what addiction is and how all addictions are a similar type of experience. They of course have varying triggers, degrees of withdrawal intensity, etc., but in general its all the same game. Strengthening that mental muscle required to escape instant-gratification-seeking and to make good decisions is basically the key to any good that can be done for yourself or the world. Quitting smoking gives you back your faith in your own agency over your life, which is why it often snowballs into helping you change your world for the better in a myriad of ways. I'm looking forward to this new opportunity for a positive life revolution!

Hope these thoughts resonate with some of you and that maybe some of you stuck in the 'casual smoker' cycle feel inspired to at least be open to the possibility of taking yourself seriously in a renewed bid to quit smoking permanently, regardless of how many times you've tried before. I'm always open to advice and encouragement and stories of shared experiences if anyone feels like chiming in. Thanks for reading and good luck out there!

5 months. I tried to quit so many times and the thing that finally worked was this reddit! Thanks!

The support of this sub and reading other peoples inspirational stores was the only thing I did different from the other 1000 times I tried to quit smoking! I am thankful for all of you! I feel so much better without cigarettes.  They controlled me for 18 years and I'm finally in charge of my life!

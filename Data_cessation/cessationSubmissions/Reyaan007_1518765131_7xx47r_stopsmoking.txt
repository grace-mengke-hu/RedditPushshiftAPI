Day 38 is running. Going cold turkey so far. Last night after crying and sobbing I did marijuana after being sober on it for 45 days. Then I fell asleep, woke up had my breakfast now I'm facing a very strong and intense craving for cigarettes. Am I going to relapse?

Update :
I brought a pack of cigarettes an hour ago. Smoked two of them. Tasted really bad and didn't feel any better, I realized I no longer need it and poured water in the pack of cigarette and threw it away. Finally I'm mentally and physically free from cigarettes. Thank you guys for the support and words of experience.
I won, cigarettes lost.

I'm at 132 days and I never think of cigarettes anymore :) Keep it up if you're struggling everyone!!

Cigarettes ran my life for 10 years (and I'm only 25)... they were my first thought upon waking up, had to have one after each meal, couldn't drink coffee without them, couldn't take my morning shit without one, needed one every hour and a half while working. I even got to the point where I couldn't enjoy smoking pot without rolling a joint with half tobacco. Now that's fucking BAD.


Quit 4 months ago and I've never felt better. If you're still getting cravings just keep holding out!! My cravings didn't end until the 3 month mark or so... one day I just realized "holy shit I haven't even thought of cigarettes for like 5 days!" Also, now when a friend comes over and he has to go out for a cigarette every hour or so, it really helps put it in perspective how much they used to run my life.



Remember, we're quitting so that every hour and day of our lives isn't dictated by a poisonous substance that is doing it's damnedest to ensure that we die sooner.

I done gone and smoked one

I quit smoking when 2016 turned to 2017, not as a new years resolution per s√© but out of convenience. See, I never did enjoy smoking when hungover and New Years, as ever, provided a decent one to kickstart my efforts to ditch the death sticks. Beyond the first week I've not had any serious cravings for a cigarette, didn't even have a serious craving today, honest to god... Or whatever power it is that judges relapsing smokers. I just saw my flatmates pack like I do every day, with the major exception that I gave it a go, I'm not sure if I even enjoyed it or hated it. What I **do** know is that feel a bit sad, avoiding nicotine has felt like something of a personal achievement and a small point of pride. I still want to tell myself that I'm almost three months free of nicotine, but somehow I feel a bit hypocritical doing it. What exactly am I?

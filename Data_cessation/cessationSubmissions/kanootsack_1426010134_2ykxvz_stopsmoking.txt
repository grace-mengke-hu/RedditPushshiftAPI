3 months and counting! Here's what helped me the most.

I smoked a **pack a day** for **5 years** and now I have a 94 day badge on this subreddit. I could list many different things that helped me get through the tough parts but here are 5 that I think were most important:

##**1. Failed attempts**
One important thing for me was realizing that every failed attempt at quitting was still a success. I would tell anyone trying to quit not to get discouraged when you slip up. Think: In the grand scheme of things, eventually one of my attempts will be successful if I really want to quit. So, there will be some number of failed attempts before the attempt to quit that lasts. I need to get past those failed attempts, learn what triggered me to smoke, and be ready for those triggers the next time I attempt to stop smoking.

##**2. It's easier than you're making it up to be**
This is easier said than believed. But one thing I discovered was that I was imagining quitting as this impossible feat that would take days of misery and struggle to overcome. This does not have to be so. We are what we make of things. Once I started to be more relaxed with the idea of quitting, the faster I was able to ignore the cravings. I think the whole idea of quitting cigarettes being so difficult is over done and scares people from trying to stop. Obviously it sucks and is hard to do, but its not impossible, especially if you truly want to quit.

##**3. Challenge yourself, make mistakes**
I personally think it will be much more difficult to quit if you try to hide from the cigarettes. You need to learn to say no when someone is literally handing you a cigarette. Some old US President, (Roosevelt maybe?) put packs of cigarettes all over his office and home when he wanted to quit. He would always offer them to whoever visited with him and would think, "This poor sucker needs a cigarette, but I don't." This is an ambitious way to go about quitting (trust me I tried it.) But, I think you can take away that "I am better than you" mentality. Don't speak it out loud, but just think to yourself. You are making the better decision to not smoke when around other smokers. After I was a week or two into my quitting I would start to excercise my ability to say no. I made a game of it. I would always go with my friends outside on their cigarette breaks. How long could I last with them before I started to have cravings? I was surprised how long I could last, and when I did start having thoughts of smoking, I would simply walk back inside! It seems like a trap but this little mind game worked wonders for me.

##**4. /r/stopsmoking**
Yes! This subreddit was huge for helping me. Whether or not you post anything I think it helps just to see that there are people struggling to quit every day at every stage of quitting. No matter if its your first day or your 2nd month, there will be times that are difficult. But you can share the burden and this subreddit is a great place to go for that!

##**5. Pair quitting with something else you've always wanted to do**
Double up on goals. I started running a lot more once I stopped smoking. I think having another goal to occupy your mind with is a good way to ignore the cravings. Also, it just helps put your mind in a different state where you feel like a new person and are changing old habits. It might seem like you are overloading yourself, but the key for the first month is just doing everything a little differently so you aren't in a routine that would prompt a usual smoke.

Day 4

Today is the fourth day since I last smoked. The cravings are bad today. I haven't given in. Every time I want one I get up and walk around my house. I don't trust myself to go out any place. I am afraid if I walk past someone smoking the smell might be too much of a temptation.

Any suggestions about when I do come across someone smoking and have to walk by them? I can't stay at home tomorrow.

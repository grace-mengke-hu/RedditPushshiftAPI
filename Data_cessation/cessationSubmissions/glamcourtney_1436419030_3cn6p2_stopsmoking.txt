Timeline of Events/Symptoms

I just finished up day four, and I'm beginning to turn into quite the troll. How long will this last? Does anyone have a timeline or anything? A sort of "What To Expect When You're Desisting?" Kind of like, "Days 1-3: High Anxiety, feelings of hopelessness, little to no attention span," etc. A compendium of sorts for folks to use as a reference as they progress in their journey as a non-smoker. If this doesn't exist, we should create it. We could put our heads together and create a pretty good general timeline. I think it would be encouraging for those who are having a tough time with withdrawals; it would help folks who feel like those symptoms will never go away. What do y'all think?

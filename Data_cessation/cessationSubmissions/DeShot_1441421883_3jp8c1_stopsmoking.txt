Almost Quit Time

Hi everyone, looking forward to joining the community. I will be having my last cigarette tonight and begin my smoke free life tomorrow. I have attempted many times and I know this is the final attempt which feels really good.

Anyways, just wanted to say hello and how excited I am that there is a community to turn towards in the time of need! See you all around.

Let the withdrawals begin!

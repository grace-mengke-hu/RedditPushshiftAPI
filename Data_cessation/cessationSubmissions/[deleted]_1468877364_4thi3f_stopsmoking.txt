1 month free! My 5 tips on quitting

I remember previous quitting attempts where was I miserable at this time period, dying for a pack. But from day 1, I knew this time was different. Here's what worked for me, other than reading Mr. Carr:


--


1) *Tell myself there is nothing pleasurable about smoking.* The good sensation the odd cigarette gave me was just drug addiction, when I didn't smoke for a long period. We see smokers with something on their hands and we see it as an extra, like a drink, coffee, a chocolate. It gives nothing like that, otherwise even non-smokers would appreciate the occasional cigarette. It tastes awful and crappy for normal people because they aren't drug addicts.

2) *Don't try to forget about smoking*. Be aware of every aspect of it, how some people you know are still trapped, how the floor and roads seem filled with those things. Remind myself how bad I wanted to quit, even when I thought I was enjoying those things. When it's in your mind all the time, even without cravings, you can think about the habit rationally. I read the book by Mr. Carr several times and watched quit timeline videos a lot. Not that I needed to be reminded about the advantages. Even if smoking wasn't bad for the health, it's still expensive, smelly, and a prison. Your body craves it and you can't appreciate life without those things. That's not "living it up". That's the opposite, it's slavery.

3) *Constantly remind myself how awesome life is as a non smoker, and for finally getting rid of that thing.* I would go to green spaces and breath fresh air, being concious of my lungs working finally without cancer substances. It's one of life simplest pleasures, a deep breathing in the morning. My teeth felt always fresh and I no longer needed to keep a distance when talking to someone. I joined a gym, started eating healthier, and the greatest thing is I was a skinny kid, so I needed to bulk up anyway and my appetite has increased. Don't scare yourself about the weight gain, it's not always a bad thing. Also, it wasn't about apettite. Your body is now normal and healthy and your apettite is growing thanks to all the senses and organs going back to normal. If this is an issue for you, start exercising and lifting to speed up your metabolism (more muscles and cardio = the more calories you need)

4) *Don't avoid triggering situations, go out and do everything you always did*. In the beginning, there may be a sense of loss, of something missing. Realize it's like getting over a shitty ex that treated you like crap, cheated on you, but you had feelings for her... but also realize that you'll be fine in no time. The sooner you go out, the faster you ll stop associating those events with inhaling cancer. Looking at the stars in the forest at night, walking in a nice garden, laughing with your friends in a sunny spot with cool people around, drinking, bars, beach, sex. Or just reading alone in your basement or the first thing after waking up with coffee. These activies are pleasurable by THEMSELVES, the cigarette only ruins them. Do as many things as you did before to get rid of those neuro connections, associating them to smoking.

5) *Everytime there's a craving, picture a little cancer cell in your brain demanding and screaming for nicotine*, and realize that's all smoking is. The aesthetics, the fashion, the smoke--- all that nonsense is just brainwashing and marketing from a society that once thought this was a good thing, and still has vast interest in having people paying to get cancer.

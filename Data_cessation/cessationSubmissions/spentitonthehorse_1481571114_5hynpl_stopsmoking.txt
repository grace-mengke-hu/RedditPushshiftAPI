Quit March 25th after 30 YEARS

It took me about 2 years of conquering each trigger at a time until there was nothing left but to just stop. Ridiculously proud of myself, now if I could just be that awesome in every other part of my life.
Just wanted to let everyone know, you can do it, I was only about 13 when I started smoking :(
 But I quit,if I can do it anyone can
 Go for it youll be so happy you did
And I never, ever crave one either!

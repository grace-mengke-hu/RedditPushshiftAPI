Haven’t smoked since last Tuesday.... longest ive gone cold turkey since I started smoking

Recently I’ve been trying to work towards being more active and trying to continue to get in better shape. I decided to try mma and took my first class Tuesday. After about ten minutes in, I was humbled. We had only warmed up and everybody else was standing around with their hands on their hips breathing steadily and talking amongst each other while I was sitting on the floor trying to avoid blowing chunks and trying to regain control of my breath without anybody noticing ( it didn’t work, I’m pretty sure I sounded similar to a dying whale) . It hit me then that if I were to continue this that there’s absolutely no way in hell I could continue smoking cigs


So, for once, I decided to try to quit cold turkey. I’ve made it since Tuesday and even though I feel like major shit and can hardly stand to be anybody due to irritability, I also am finally starting to feel good again too and extremely motivated 

The last few times I quit I used a juul to help but ended up going back to cigs later on. I’m hoping this time I can stick with it 100% nicotine free. 


I didn’t really have any specific intention writing this other than to share my progress and possibly maybe give somebody else encouragement. I wouldn’t say I’m anywhere near in the clear yet but I’m getting more and more confident that I might actually be done for good this time.


Also,  This site ( https://whyquit.com/whyquit/A_Benefits_Time_Table.html ) has really helped me to continue to abstain by looking at the time table and using it as a reminder to myself on why I should quit this bullshit while I still can. Wish me luck :)

I got my star! :D

So it's been a month for me :D I haven't really spent that much time on this sub since I did my intro post, but I have been having a look here every now and then and just noticed I've got my star :)

I feel like I'm doing really well! I had a pretty bad cough last week which is easing now, but I feel like that's my body trying to get rid of all the crap in my lungs. I'm very happily surprised at how well I'm doing! Last night I had a dream and in it I was smoking - when I woke up and was really glad it was just a dream aha.

How is everyone here doing? I'd love to be a support to any of you, so if anyone ever struggles and wants someone to chat to for a while to distract them until cravings pass or even just to make a friend or anything like that, feel free to pm me. Thanks guys!

My plan to stop

I've tried several times to stop, been smoking for 8 years now... Managed to give it up for 3 months a couple of years ago and a lot of my friends are doing "Stoptober" so I'm giving it another go.

I've never had much luck with the patches etc, I've only ever been anywhere near successful by cutting down slowly and then stopping outright. So this time I have a new plan.

I'm going to cut it out hour by hour for the next few weeks. For example my first cigarette of the day is usually at 0630 when I wake up for work. I didn't allow myself to have one till 0730 today. Tomorrow I wont have one till 0830 and the day after 0930 and so on. I reckon this will work best for me because the hardest ones to cut out are the evening ones. By the time I get down to those I'll have gotten used to smoking less anyway.

So, wish me luck :)

150 days smoke free today.

Hey everyone, I've been lurking on this sub for a while and posted a few times at the beginning of my quit. You have been really helpful in getting over my nicotine addiction.

My favourite parts of quitting so far:

* I used to secret smoke at work, so now I don't have to worry about going to lunch by myself, or getting through the day without a smoke when a coworker asks to go with me.
* Not being smelly around people who don't know that I smoke
* Being able to spend time with my family without wanting to find an excuse to pop out every couple of hours.
* Money saved
* Much reduced cough

Good luck to everyone out there starting their quits now!

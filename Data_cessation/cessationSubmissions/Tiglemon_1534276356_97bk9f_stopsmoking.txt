Every day evening my craving is peak and i cave in.

I'm afraid to say I want to quit coz sooner than later I start. I don't like that. Ever since my last quit I've kept it to very few in a day. 

Now every evening I'm dying with craving and I have one or two. But I have it as everyday I start by saying today is the day and it repeats again n again n again. 

What do I do? Any tips on how to handle the evening and late night craving?

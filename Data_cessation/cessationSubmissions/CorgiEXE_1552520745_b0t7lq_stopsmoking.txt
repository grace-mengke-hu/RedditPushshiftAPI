Question about quitting cold turkey

For a bit of context i have been smoking for a 27 yr old male and have been smoking for 15 years

Ive tried quitting many times before with aids like patches lozenges and vaping. 

Nothing has worked so far so i figured my best bet is to quit cold turkey

Is there any tips you fine people have for aggrivation and the constant i want a cig thoughts?

First true attempt

Started my first real attempt to stop today. Bought an e-cigarette quite something time ago but always wound up back with the real ones. 

This time I'm making a true commitment to start with low nicotine juices and lower it over a month. Hopefully this goes well, doing it not just for myself but for my girl as well this time.

Stopped smoking through heavy workouts 10 days ago!

Replaced my nicotine induced dopamine, efedrine and so habit with getting them through hard training. It worked like a charm! Ofcourse, now i am developing an addiction to pumping iron and running around for no reason, but it could be worse.

My main motivation came from the fact that i have smoked 100.000++ of them.

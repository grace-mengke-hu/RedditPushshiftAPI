It's been 3 years since i quit and i just smoked 2 ciggies

honestly im at the point where i know if i smoke anymore i might go back. But i don't have anyone to talk to about it and im kind of stressing which is making me want to smoke again T_T i have had the urges for the last month or two really badly and its just freaking me out a bit. just needed to get this out and tell somebody anybody.

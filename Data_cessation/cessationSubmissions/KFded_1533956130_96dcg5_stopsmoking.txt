Looking for Aid/Advice

I'll try and make this "TLDR" as short as possible. 
I started smoking at the age of 11 you could say, being a troubled youth, hanging with the wrong people, and I would take a puff of a cig once in a great while, but it never developed into a habit, fast forward to age 17 and a family incident happened and sent everything that I knew and comfortable with, out of control. I was sent to live with relatives til things improved, these relatives were Asian Inlaws (im white) and I was only really close with my cousin in law, not really anyone else or really knew them, I have also dealt with anxiety my entire life (to the point of having panic attacks and black outs) I ended up taking up smoking weed (life changing when it comes to dealing with Anxiety and stress) and I took up smoking cigs. Now im 26 and I have tried to quit 5x already. 

I went cold turkey and could only last 17 hours. 
I made a monthly plan to cut back on how much i smoked to the point where my body was getting use to less nicotine, so I could cope easier with going cold turkey, made it from 32 cigs a day (yes 32) to about 11 a day, and I still couldnt make it longer than 24hours, and eventually lost control of how much I was smoking again (back up to about 24 a day) 
Ive tried using vapes, but I felt like I was going to start developing a habit from smoking vapes, I was getting to used to it and it scared me, and was barely helping with my addiction, so I stopped that. 

I have been preparing myself for the past week to try and go cold turkey again as I feel its the best and only way to get myself off of it, but its the mental aspect of the quitting that gets me badly. 

Any advice on how to hurdle over that would be much appreciated. 
(Working out while would be an ideal idea, I have mild scoliosis so lifting weights is extremely strenuous on my spine) Though I do try and do push ups and sit ups every day.

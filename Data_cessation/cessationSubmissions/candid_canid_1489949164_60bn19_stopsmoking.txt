I quit and I owe it to a particularly bad cold. Afraid of relapse.

Not much else to say. I kept trying to quit, and I kept failing at it. Then, I got myself a really nasty cold that made my throat sore as hell. I wanted to smoke but it hurt too much, so I ended up stopping... my throat finally got back into good shape, and I realized I haven't had a cigarette in a week as of today. 

I quit, and I didn't even realize I'd quit... I think I'm lucky. I threw out all my cigarettes. 

My challenge now, friends, is all the things that are associated with my habit. I was having my coffee this morning and started to look for a cigarette. I don't know what I'm going to do when I go fishing, since I always used to bring along a pack of smokes for a day of fishing. 

How do I keep myself from quitting my quitting?

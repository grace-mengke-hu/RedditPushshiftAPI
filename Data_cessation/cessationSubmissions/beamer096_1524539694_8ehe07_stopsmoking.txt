Does anyone have any tips on how to avoid temptation?

So I have quit smoking for about 4 or 5 months, but it was during the winter when it was cold so I did not want to be outside. However the weather is now warming up and the urges to smoke is getting stronger and stronger and I almost caved and bought a pack tonight. I'm stuck between 'don't do it! You've been so strong!' and 'Just one pack is fine'. And I just need some advice on how to not give In!

Here we go, time to kick it!

Alright guys, I've actually been a lurker here off and on admiring how people could kick the crap. Recently I have been having talks with my SO regarding our health, and the future.

We've both decided that we are going to stop, but not for just ourselves! Recent news has told us smoking is practically killing our chances at a future child (both because the harm smoking does, and the money for potential IVF)

I've started reading the "Easy Method To Stop Smoking" that is highly recommended and I have to say so far I am feeling it, and I actually resonate with this guy so I actually care about what I'm reading. I always thought about it as "Well I've been doing it for 10 years, kinda late now", but it's never to late! 

Anyway, kind of a long  hello, but I hope to see you guys around often because while I know I can stop, the path is bound to get a bit bumpy

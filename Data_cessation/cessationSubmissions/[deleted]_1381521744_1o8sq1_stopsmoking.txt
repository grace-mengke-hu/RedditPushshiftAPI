It's been a month (woohoo!) - any tips for getting rid of my bad breath?

I'm super stoked to have made it this far - it's so much easier now!

I'm feeling very conscious of my breath though - I chew gum pretty often, and constantly brush my teeth (and tongue) but my breath is still a bit offensive - not romantic at all for my SO. 

Does anyone have any tips for me?

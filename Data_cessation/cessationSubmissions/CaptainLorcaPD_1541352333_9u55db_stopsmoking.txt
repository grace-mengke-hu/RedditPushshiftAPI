Help! Craving getting worse

Posted a short while ago about my strong cravings. Been through 4.5 months.

More and more smoking becomes a topic in my head in the evening. So strong I feel like i hit out and gonna buy a pack.

I have no idea what to do and if it gets even stronger.. well.. I donâ€™t know.

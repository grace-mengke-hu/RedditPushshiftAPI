Getting sick after quitting

Hey guys I’m 36 days cigarette free and have just come down with my second sickness since
quitting smoking. My first one was when I first quit and was like a common cold that lasted two weeks, was better for two weeks and now I’m sick again. This time it’s much worse like a flu. Has anyone else had a similar experience when quitting? I thought my immune system would be stronger, never got sick smoking daily for over 6 years

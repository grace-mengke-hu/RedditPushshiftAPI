turning a craving into 50 dollars...it's magic!

about a month in (my badge is off--working on it) and tonight's election had me feeling extremely stressed out. lately i've been doing well with distracting myself from cravings with something like chewing gum or maybe a low cal iced tea, but tonight it was just not working. i kept thinking *if trump wins i should start smoking again* because that thought process makes sense... 

either way i went to a convenience store and was highly debating just starting all over again and giving into a craving to calm down. but instead i said, "if i'm that determined to waste ten dollars, let's just play a scratch off instead." i don't play lottery really often and usually have bad luck, but i did it anyway. i won 50 dollars on a 5 dollar ticket. 

50 dollars!! a sign to keep on quitting! good luck to everyone else, don't let the election get you down. buy a lottery ticket, unwind with some comfort food, take a walk...the sun will rise tomorrow no matter what.

People who have saved their pennies or are planning to - let's talk about the fun stuff you're going to use the money for!

I discovered I was up to a thousand bucks, so decided to take a last minute overnighter to San Fransisco to see "Hamilton." It was so fun and spontaneous that I'm going to continue to put the cash I otherwise would have spent on cigarettes into an "Experience Fund". No "things," or bills etc. - only memories. I would never in a million years have taken such a trip as a smoker.

What fun things are you saving up for? What fun things have you purchased, or plan to? I want to hear all about them!

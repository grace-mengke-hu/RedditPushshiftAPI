I got drunk and smoked my first cig since I quit. How can I make sure this doesn't happen again?

As the title says. Still drunk right now. I have no friends that smoke, so no problems there. I bought a pack, smoked one cig and threw away the pack. My whole body tingles. I would prefer if this doesn't happen again. What do?9

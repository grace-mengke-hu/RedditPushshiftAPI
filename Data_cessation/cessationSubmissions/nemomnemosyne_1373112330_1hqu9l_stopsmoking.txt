45 days, dreamt I smoked a cigarette.

Last night I dreamt I had a cigarette. The guilt, even in my dreams of watching a month and a half of willpower go down the drain was present even in my imagination.

That's why I'm even more relieved after waking up this morning and realizing it was a dream! 

You guys can quit too! My biggest suggestion is to take that money you would normally apply to cigarette packs and put it away in an envelope. I began doing this, about 5$/2days and managed to get me a much needed new hard drive! The next thing I'm saving for is a CPU/MoBo. :)

Seriously guys, you can do this thing. After the first week or two it really becomes unnoticeable for the most part. 

As a last note, I recommend the CessationNation app for tracking your health/money saved/days without. Helps as an added reminder of why you're doing what you're doing.

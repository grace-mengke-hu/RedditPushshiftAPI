Approaching 3 months; Still struggling.

Hi!

So maybe not as tough as the first few weeks, but man, I'm still struggling.

Whenever I think about smoking or  see someone smoking I feel cheated and deprived, which makes me sad, depressed and have anxiety. Which is stupid. Really stupid.

All I wanted to do when I was smoking was to quit smoking. Now all I want to do when not smoking is to smoke.

I understand that most of the people who have gone this far is no longer hanging around this sub, but I wanted to ask just in case there is any of those people left if anyone else have gone through the same?

Am I a lost cause? Will I always feel like this?

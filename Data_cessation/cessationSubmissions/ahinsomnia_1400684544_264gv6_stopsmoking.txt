Anxiety Since Quitting

I quit smoking on May 1st after reading Alan Carr's book. I have not slept a full night since and have been having daily panic episodes. I used to suffer from insomnia in my adolescence (as evidenced by my user name), but it improved when I reached adulthood. I'm unfortunately concluding that cigarettes leveled me out. I thought I was taking the right steps controlling my anxiety by quitting smoking, jogging, and reducing alcohol, but I honestly feel worse. Has anyone else had this experience? I do plan to see a doctor.

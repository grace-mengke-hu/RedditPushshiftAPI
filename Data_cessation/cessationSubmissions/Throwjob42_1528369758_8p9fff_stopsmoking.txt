Anger is how I deal with stuff

I don't really want to quit smoking, but I did, but I still posit that I'd be much happier if I smoked; like most smokers, I made peace with a lot of the social and health complications. Lately, I've had these outbursts a dozen times a day and had intrusive thoughts and hurting people I know and I didn't feel like this before. Anyway, I'm going to stare at a dirty plate and think about breaking it over someone's head.

Almost there...

Phew, it's been a turbulent day. I decided to stop smoking last night and that was easy enough, as I just hung out with a friend and watched some movies instead of going out.  Today, however, seriously put my patience to the test. First off, I accidentally locked myself out of my house, which resulted in spending fifty-five dollars on a locksmith. This was a minor inconvenience. A few hours later, I'm doing the dishes and ended up slicing open my thumb, which resulted in having to drive to the ER to patch myself up. I'm not the best around needles and my anxiety was off the charts, but I pulled through. I got home from the hospital a little bit ago and will be hitting one day in less than an hour, so thumbs up to quitting and hope this will be my final attempt at quitting!  


TL;DR: Today took a massive shit on me, but I've almost made it to one day!  

PS-I need to reset my quit day. Anyone know how to do that?

13 Years On - 9 Days Off

10 days ago, a good friend (& colleague) of mine told me she'd like to go out with me sometime. Two requirements: I quit smoking, and I ask her out on a "proper date." I've been pining over this girl for years, so I was ecstatic.

The next day, my pack ran out. I smoked one of my roommate's but haven't smoked since. This was Thursday, 4/6. I started planning our first date.

The weekend goes by, and we're back in the office. She says she wants to talk, can we grab a drink or something after work? Over drinks, she says she thought about it, and she can't date me because we share different religious beliefs. We wouldn't be able to share those aspects of ourselves with each other. She's not looking for something casual. She doesn't see the point. She's sorry. She's hurt too.

 I drive home in tears. I grab a beer and go sit out back with my roommate, who's smoking. He doesn't offer, but I know I could have one. Or two, or three. But I don't ask.

I wake up the next day and I'm exhausted. There's no coffee. A cigarette would help me wake up, but I just drag my feet to the bathroom instead. I can't focus on showering. I'm just standing there, the shower bearing down on my back. I remember something from the previous night telling me "don't worry." A small voice offering help. I choose not to worry.

It's been 9 days since I quit. I see her every day.

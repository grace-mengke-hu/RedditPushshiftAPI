Question about nicotine

Okay. I'm on my third quit, cold turkey and 52 days in! Longest ever, omg! Ever since July of las year I've been off and on with my quit. Well since July I've had off and on dizziness/lightheaded feeling. Before you assume what it could be, just know I've had all blood work done and it's normal. Blood pressure normal, blood sugar normal. MRI CT scan normal. Finally got to see a cardiologist, guess what normal! ENT normal. Allergies tested, I have none. I could have silent migraines my neuro said and that's one reason I could have the dizziness. I feel like it's more of an issue when I turn my head, but I could be crazy. Oh blood pressure normal, excellent. Every single test, anemia vitamins, etc all freaking normal. I'm so confused and frustrated. I'm wondering if I should give my body some nicotine by chewing the gum. Maybe that'll help my dizziness ? I don't even know what to do. Any advice?

I feel sick

After quitting a few years ago with the patch, I started sneaking again this summer, and now I have an inconvenient secret habit.

About a week ago, I started feeling dizzy and sore when I smoked, to the point where it became a pain in the ass to light one. I have lousy circulation anyway, and I suddenly really notice the cold hands and tingling.

I want to quit straight away, but I'm terrified. I'm starting school soon, and I become an asshole if I can't smoke, even though it's not fun anymore.

I know gum is just kicking the can down the road, but I'm increasingly nervous and running out of time and options.

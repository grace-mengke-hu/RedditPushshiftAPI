This time, instead of 'quitting', I'm going to try playing a 'game'; Don't Smoke 2000

**Edit:** I ended up watching the allen carr webcast before starting last night... it's the weirdest thing, since watching the first half I have completely lost my appetite for smoking. So strange that being told something in the right way can be so powerful. I just went a full day at work without a single craving o_o it's actually bizarre. So, I no longer need this game. The numbers just seem kind of irrelevant now that I'm a non-smoker. Going to go and finish the rest of it, seriously recommend!

I have been putting notes up on the wall every time I've tried to quit in the past couple of weeks, saying things like 'I quit smoking on 5th June'. Yet, I find it only too easy to say 'aah i'll just change the date' then light one up.

As an experienced quitter (not a great thing to be!) I've begun to notice the thought patterns that cause me to fail, so this time I'm going to try and flip the way I think about the whole thing on its head. Instead of wading through the infinite quagmire of 'quitting', I'm going to play a real life game of hit the number. So I'm setting myself a target: 2000 hours, a fairly arbitrary number but the best one that came to mind; sounds long enough.

The plan is to make my focus this challenge rather than quitting, that way, when I'm at my weakest I can say to myself 'At worst I'll feel like this for another 2000 hours' rather than my usual 'WHEN WILL IT END???!?'

Starting at midnight this will be my 5th attempt in 2 weeks, enough momentum in me for 1 big push this time. Hopefully, after 2000 hours I will be ready to make that lifetime commitment. Then, I will reward myself with a coconut massage.

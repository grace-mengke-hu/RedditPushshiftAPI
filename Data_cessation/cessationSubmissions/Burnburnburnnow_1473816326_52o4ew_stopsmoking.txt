First real test... Day 2

Came home to car with doors open and hood up-- wtf?!? Find roommate trying to jump start messed up battery. Thinking wow that's nice he is trying to get it to run.

Only to have him say, 'Yeah, I need to move it so I can get my yellow truck out.' Mind you, we are parked on a street, right? The order of the cars go green car (his), yellow car (the one he wants to move), van (other roommates car), mine.

So literally he could have pulled up his OTHER car to have access to his. Instead he finds my car key and decides to move it. Then actually had the nerve to get upset at me when I tell him he should have texted me!

His response!? 'What, so I have to wait for everyone else?' WTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTFWTF!!!!!!!!!!

Needless to say I have moved the keys to somewhere else so he doesn't have access to them anymore.

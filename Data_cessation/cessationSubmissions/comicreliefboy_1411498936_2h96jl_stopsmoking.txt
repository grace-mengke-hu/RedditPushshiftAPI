I'm really trying but I need help

So I'm currently weaning myself off until October 1 when I plan on going cold turkey and/or using patches. I typically smoke between 13 and 18 per day. I recently started my new plan, where I don't smoke any until evening - maybe one or two by bedtime. During the day, though, I feel anxious and while I haven't broken my streak yet I'm trying to find ways to get through it, like jogging (that helps a lot), distracting myself, or simply ignoring the urge. What other ways do you help get yourself through the day?

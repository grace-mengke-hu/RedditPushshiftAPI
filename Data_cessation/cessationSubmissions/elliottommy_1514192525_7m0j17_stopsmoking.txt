105 Hours in. Constipation?

Day 5 of non-smoking. I ate some yogurt yesterday and that enabled me to go to toilet for the first time in four days and it was very hard. One of the biggest outcomes in my entire life. (Sorry, hehe) It was unflushable!!

Now, I am back to constipation again. Should I cheat myself with the helping yogurt for a while?

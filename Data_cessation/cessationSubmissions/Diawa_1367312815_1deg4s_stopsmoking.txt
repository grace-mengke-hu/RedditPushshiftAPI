Guaranteed success for me!

I just quit smoking. This is finally the time I quit for good.  I have been battling this disease for too long.  I have  read Allen Carrs book in the past, I have the patch, gum, Champix, and vapour smokes.  I have quit and failed countless times....but this time is different.  I have learned through experience what caused me to fail, what my triggers were, and what seemed to work.  I have mashed all these valuable things together with the strongest desire to quit.   I want to quit so I am going to quit and stay quitted.

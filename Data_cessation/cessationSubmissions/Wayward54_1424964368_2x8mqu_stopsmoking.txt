Coffee break.

Currently two (not three) days into my cold turkey quit. There have been some moments, though nothing I wasn't prepared for. My big issue right at this particular moment is coffee. 

Coffee in the morning is my "break" time, which was also my smoke time. Those two things are very heavily intertwined. Common sense may say "Well, lay off the coffee till you can separate the smoking urge" but no. I just want my coffee. 

Not really looking for advice. Just wanting to write it down, get it out, while I sip on my second cup of the day. Thanks.

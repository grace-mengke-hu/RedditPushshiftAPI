How can I help my parents to stop smoking?

So my parents are incredibly addicted to those coffin nails and no matter what I've tried to do, they still end up smoking almost a pack's worth a week.

I'm an asthmatic as well. Just this morning, my mom was smoking a cigarette while I went to make my coffee so I can make my way to class later that morning. I had an asthma problem earlier that morning, but I managed to handle it. When I told her to put it out, she thought I was being mean. It's not mean to care though, is it?

My dad is just ridiculous about it though. He smokes whenever he can. I'm surprised nothing has happened to him yet. But I won't be surprised when something does, honestly. No matter what I tell him, he still does it. I'm more worried about him than my mom, since she is actually using restraint some of the time.

Anyways, I digress. If any of you have any way to help me help them stop smoking, or at least slow down, I would be really grateful. Thank you for reading.

The sooner the better?

So hello all, I'm on my 3rd day of quitting, passed the 72 hour mark like 8 hours ago. Hooray!

Small story: just now my dad (a heavy smoker) was teaching me how to drive like he has for the past few months on thursdays, and mostly afterwards we have a few beers and smoke like 6 cigs in an hour. Yeah, 6.

Well today, he smoked 3 and I smoked none! It was really hard but I managed to not smoke any anyway. 


What I want to say is, if anyone here hasn't been smoking for that long, like me (5 years max) stop while you can!

I don't think I'm experiencing any withdrawal systems. Perhaps sleeping badly, but that's about it.

Or maybe it has to come? 

Anyhow I will still fight it!

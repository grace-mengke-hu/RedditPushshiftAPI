Is 10 days long enough to pass a cotinine test?

Exactly as the title says, I recently quit smoking cold turkey for a job. I'm getting drug tested on Monday and it will have been 10 days since my last cigarette. Before that I was smoking about 1/2 a pack of Marlboro menthol slates. I only picked up smoking for a month or so. Before that I quit because I was pregnant then breastfeeding. I picked it back up then found out I would be having this test. I'm mad at myself for starting again at all otherwise I wouldn't be having this problem. Really hoping I pass and can make this my last time quitting.

causal smoker looking for tips

I guess I am what you call a causal smoker.  I can probably count on one hand how many times i have actually bought a pack of cigarettes on one hand but that doesn't stop me from bumming a smoke or 2 from friends when we drink or just sitting around outside.  how have you approached these enabling friends and how have you dealt with the urges when in a situations like that.  i understand removing myself from these situations would be best but how do you do it without becoming a social recluse?

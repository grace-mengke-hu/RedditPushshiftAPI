Do real successful quitters exist??? Drop a tip, please!

What I mean by this is a person who doesn't think of smoking even when one has experienced an extremely awful situation or a great one. 

Does it really reach a point wherein the connection of emotions and the thoughts of smoking finally disconnect? Or will I struggle forever telling myself mentally that smoking will not fix anything? 

I just have this problem of believing that there are really successful quitters out there who don't occasionally smoke. If you've done this, your tips are highly appreciated! Thanks!

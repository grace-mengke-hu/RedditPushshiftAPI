Thank you

I just wanted to make a post that's not about a craving I'm experiencing, or about how hard it is to quit. No, I wanted to tell all you guys thank you. Being here, for 24 days now, is so motivating. You guys help all of us push through when it's hard, or when we're bored, or alone, or sad. Anytime a craving might hit, anytime we might fail, reading and posting here is a back up system that works.  
Yesterday I was having trouble, I didn't want to smoke but it was so hard. Simply posting here and having someone respond, someone who knows what it feels like, makes it infinitely better and lighter. So everybody here who gives compliments, who supports, who listens, who advices, who posts, thank you. You're helping an awful lot of people kick a destroying habbit. You can be proud of yourself. Not just for not smoking, but also for helping other people to not smoke.

2016 New Year Resolution is to permanently quit smoking.

So, I have my one last pack of dunhill left over from my carton. And I promise my wife that I will quit by the 30th. We are planning on having a child within the next two years. Next year would be new me and my healthy lungs. Any suggestion on withdraw relief would be greatly appreciate. I will try lace up and go for a jog every morning, wish me luck.

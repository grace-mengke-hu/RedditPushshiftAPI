I've once again started on the road to quitting, hopefully it takes this time >.>

I've been smoking for about 6 years, pretty much since the stress of college started, and lately I just feel super shitty about it.  The first year or so I smoked like 2 a day, and I remember thinking it was never going to turn into a thing and I just figured I would stop before it got anywhere.  Now I smoke from 6-12 cigarettes a day as a baseline.  I know other people have smoked more for longer, but for me this is just too much...

As of this last week I've been sick, Saturday I didn't smoke anything, and Sunday I didn't smoke until like 6 PM, so this sort of blew a breath of fresh air into me wanting to quit again.  I've started by limiting myself to 6 cigarettes max a day, keeping track of how many I smoke and gradually smoking less.  I've done this before, and without fail it always helps... I just hope I can stick with it this time; it always seems like I get to a terrible point in my life where I don't care and give up on quitting... generally I feel like not caring about my health enough is the reason I still smoke in the first place...  

Anyways, here's hoping I start posting more here and actually kick this piece of shit habit!

Quit cold turkey

I officially "quit" about two weeks ago but have been taking drags off of people's cigs every now and then since. As of Saturday I am done doing that as well and am just quitting cold turkey. I've smoked steadily only for about a year and a half but this past year has been very stressful with the passing of my father and the recent passing of one of my best friends and because of that I have built an even stronger dependence. Since I quit I have been experiencing reoccurring centralized migraines above my left eye that come around every day like clockwork, is this normal and if so does any one have any tips on how to help with this excruciating pain? Thanks guys!

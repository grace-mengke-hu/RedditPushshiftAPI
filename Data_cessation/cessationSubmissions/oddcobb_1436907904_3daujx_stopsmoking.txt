Struggling 36 days in

Hi all,

I've tried to quit smoking before and both times I've relapsed a few months in. I'm really struggling right now. I haven't started smoking yet, but I just need a pep talk. On one hand, I know cigarettes are terrible,  but on the other they are my pacifier. I've been trying to do other things to keep my mind off. I've tried to start running. Now, I'm just rambling. Could some of you share some good reasons for quitting? Thanks all.

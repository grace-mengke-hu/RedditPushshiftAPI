I relapsed every day since three days.

Hi,

I already, today for the third time, have thrown away everything like tobacco, the machine and the filters and gifted the lighters to my fathers workers.

The last days I have got this back from trash. Now I do not want to act like that anymore so I let it out there in the yard. It will be picked up in the next two weeks. So I just need to stay away from that.

The thing is, it is so easy to relapse. It is always the same thought get out and get it back. I still got more than half a pack of nicotine gum. So I will use it more often I guess.

Need to stay strong on that one!

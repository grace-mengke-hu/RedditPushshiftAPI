Had a night full of smoke rings

I've been a pack a day smoker for 8 years and now it's been almost 5 months since I quit; the cravings are all gone. In fact, I regularly go out with smokers on 'smoke-breaks' and stand at a distance to enjoy the company, never ever felt the need to bump a cigarette. 

Yesterday, however, suddenly I have had a massive craving. The urge to smoke a cigarette took total possesion of me and from somewhere I have got this cigarette with me. I light it up and the first drag gives me such a hit that I collapse. I take 2-3 more drags and immediately feel guilty that now all the good work is now undone. "Why am I smoking?" I ask myself and bang comes the answer (or the realization) that "I'm not smoking". I wake up and everything's fine. It was just a dream. 

Never felt better :)

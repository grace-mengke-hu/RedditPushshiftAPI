Coping with depression and quitting

I have quite severe depression and am now 6 days into quitting. Normally I get to the one week mark and then relapse I don't want to do that this time but I struggle to motivate myself when my depression is there. Health and money motivations don't really work to keep me going. Anyone in a similar position got any tips?

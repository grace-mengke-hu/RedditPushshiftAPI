Celebrating 3 months! I didn't even realize it.

So 3 months ago I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/2a5t6z/day_6/) on the day after I started taking Chantix. I did the recommended 1 week of Chantix prior to quitting and then on 7/14 just went cold turkey on it.

[Day 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/2awcp5/deep_into_day_3_i_can_do_this/)  
[Day 5](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/2b19aa/dawn_of_day_5/) 

Days 1-3 were the worst. Things started to ease up on Day 4, and I just kind of went through it with blinders on. I came out in Day 5 feeling pretty confident that I'd be alright. I was in a better mood than I'd been all week. I went to my party, I chilled in the pool, drank vodka and tea, and did jello shots til 4 am. We had a great time, and my friends - who are awesome and have been so very supportive - talked with me and distracted me from smoking all night. It was awesome. 

We had a family reunion the next day and it was rather difficult not to smoke with my uncle and cousin, but I managed by just walking away when they smoked. 

The weeks after that were pretty easy - I think thanks to the Chantix. I cut everything out of my life that reminded me of smoking. Changed my driving habits so I went to a different gas station. I stopped posting here because just thinking of it seemed risky to me. So I backed off entirely, but I haven't smoked since.

Last week I went off Chantix. Yesterday marked 3 months. 7/14 - 10/14. 93 days. It was the hardest day I've had since. I think the drug is finally out of my system and yesterday was my first day truly resisting without the aid of the drug. I didn't even realize it had been 3 months until I saw the date at work today.

It feels great. Yesterday I just kept reminding myself that I no longer smoke - I'd quit, I'm done with it, and that's not me, not who I am. 

I wanted to share. To everyone just starting their journey, it really does get easier. I'm cheering for you!

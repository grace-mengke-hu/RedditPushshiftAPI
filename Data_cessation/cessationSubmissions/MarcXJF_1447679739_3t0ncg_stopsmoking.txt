A good reason to quit? I think so!

Ok so, I am quitting smoking tomorrow.
I have about 10g left in my 20g pouch which will see me through today, then tomorrow I will be quit for good, after about 5 attempts throughout the last 3 years.

The reason this time (the last reason) isn't because of money saving, health or smoking restrictions. It is purely based on the fact that i want to grow a big bushy beard! I am 23 and have never been able to grow a full beard, I have good stubble, but I can't seem to get it to grow to Chuck Norris standards. I read on a health website that smoking reduces the amount of oxygen your blood can carry, therefore inhibiting hair follicles.  

I am aiming to calm my cravings with some vigorous weight lifting (I don't work out really) and drinking lots of water.

I won't be using patches, gum or e-cigs (because e-cigs are basically mouth-fedoras).

I might use lozenges but I'll see how I feel.

Any tips for calming cravings? Preferably non-oral fixation.

Just thought I'd share this, don't know why but there ya go.

I'm quitting and I'm scared

I smoked my last cigarette at 8 am this morning. The withdrawals feel pretty intense but I'm pretty sure majority of it is probably in my head. I'm just sooo scared of the withdrawals and having to learn new coping mechanisms.  I dont smoke a lot but ive always associated smoking with stress relief so I feel like my addiction may be more psychological than physical. What are your thoughts on this and how did you guys deal with this?

I had a bad moment

So....i had a bad moment and I fully decided I was going to smoke. I decided not to let the craving pass. I talked myself into it. Anyway I had 2. And none again for 2 days. I think it was a blip.....but I'm not being complacent has anyone else had similar blips and managed to get right back on the no smoking wagon?

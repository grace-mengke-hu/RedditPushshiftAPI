The beginning

Hi r/stopsmoking I am in the beginning of day 3 without smoking, it's been going alright but I have most of my trouble in the mornings, after meals, and when I'm driving. I would love some helpful hint or things that worked for you all to make those times easier. I also haven't told anyone that I have been trying to quit smoking in fear that I won't be successful and feel stupid for not being able to go thru with it so I haven't really had any encouragement or support that's where I turn to you guys who understand what I'm going thru. Thanks in advance for the tips and encouragement! I really appreciate it!

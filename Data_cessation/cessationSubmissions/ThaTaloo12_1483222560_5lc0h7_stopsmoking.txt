Joining the New Year Resolution Movement.

My first post on Reddit ever. Seems fitting that it should be on New Years Eve entailing the journey I'm about to go through. I've tried quitting cigarettes before and only lasted 4 days. It was probably the most psychologically difficult task I've attempted (not to mention that first cigarette after 4 days was very euphoric). I have seen multiple posts on this subreddit exclaiming how happy and better they feel since they have quit. I really hope to achieve that level of happiness. The burden of my chest hurting, coughing, smelling bad, and obviously the financial burden has taken over my life; I have finally regained the courage to quit smoking again. I hope to be an intricate part of this subreddit moving forward. The group help setting is a powerful tool and I hope I can achieve the goal and help other individuals achieve their goal as well. So to all of my fellow Resolution Quitters, may the force be with all of you. Stay strong friends.

Quit smoking flu

I'm on day 2 and I feel yuck. I woke up feeling great! I mowed my yard, cooked for my family, took the kids to the park, then it hit: body aches, a HORRIBLE headache, anxiety/tight chest, soreness. I'm sure it's withdraw and its rough.  Makes me never want to pick one up again.  Thank you for listening. Good to know I'm not alone.

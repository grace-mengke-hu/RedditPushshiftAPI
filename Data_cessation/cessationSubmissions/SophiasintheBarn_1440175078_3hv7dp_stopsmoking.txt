It's day 5. Evenings are really tough.

I've lurked in this sub on and off in the past when I was thinking about quitting (and chickened out). It's been so, so helpful since I took the plunge Sunday night--no one else around me is quitting IRL, but there's so much support here, so thanks! 

I smoked varying amounts over the past 11 years. The last year or two I smoked ~4 cigs/day (Spirit Yellows, which I convinced myself were not "that bad," especially since it was only a few).

I'm using the patch, and I started on the second step or whatever, for if you smoked <10/day. So far it's been OK, except day 3. Holy crap, day 3. Anyways, I'm fine all day but after work around 6 or so I start to have trouble. I really miss it more than having significant cravings, but I've had at least one meltdown each evening. I try to busy myself with other things but I keep having to stop and be dramatic for an hour+. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Advice? When will it pass?

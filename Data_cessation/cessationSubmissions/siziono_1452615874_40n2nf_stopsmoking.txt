Got a test coming up. Might the quit affect my performance?

Hey guys, long time lurker here. Just wanted to get some of your advices. This is one of the few times I've attempted to quit. However, I've got an important test coming up within the next couple weeks and I was wondering if the withdrawal symptoms might affect my ability to do well on the test. I don't want to both feel like shit from the withdrawal and from a bad test. 

Please tell me what you think. It's greatly appreciated. 

Cheers :-)

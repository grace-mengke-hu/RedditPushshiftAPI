Day 3. But I work in a gas station... Any advice?

I started smoking at the age of 15. Nothing huge, just a cigarette here and there until I turned 18 when I started smoking a pack a week. I'm 22 now, and I smoke about 2 packs a week. I'm ready to quit and I'm three days in but I work in a gas station where we have a whole wall full of cigarettes. If I stay home I know I can quit... Pretty sure I need money to live though. :) Anyone have any advice for me? Quitting my job is not something I really wanna do either.

This last week...

Has been TOUGH. I've been snapping at my SO for no reason, and feel pretty bad about it. The last couple of nights have been especially bad. All I've wanted to do the last few days is go buy a pack of cigarettes. I KNOW it's not going to solve anything, and I'm going to feel horrible about going back after 37 days, but that's where I'm at. I'm going to tough it out, but man, I miss smoking sometimes.

7 Months In

Just wanted to write a bit about my experience of quitting smoking and to let you guys know that it does get better once you reach a certain point. A bit of background about myself, I'd been a regular smoker for 3 years (about 1 pack a day) and repeatedly tried to quit smoking on multiple occasions with nicotine spray and gum. Here's a bit of a summary of what I experienced.



**First three days** were not really tough and the initial willpower is still there.

**3 days - 1 week:** Quite a few cravings a day (up to around 5 or so). In these situations, just remember that the cravings pass, its just as it builds up inside you it may seem that it won't go away. You just need to believe that it will pass and eventually it does.

**1 week - 2 weeks:** Cravings going down slowly. Losing a lot of energy (getting tired very easily) and becoming more irritable.

**2 weeks - 3 weeks:** Still quite irritable, cravings are not frequent anymore.

**3 weeks - 4 weeks:** Beginning of really bad gastrointestinal problems. Constipation lasting up to 6 days sometimes. Best remedy I found was drinking some prune juice. This lasted for about 1 month and was probably the most annoying part of quitting. I swear I've never farted more in that one month than in the rest of my life combined!

**1 month - 1 1/2 months:** Not much change, digestion problems still in effect.

**1 1/2 months - 2 months:** Most difficult part of the whole experience. Its difficult to explain but its as if depression started to set in. For a whole week I had zero energy and was seriously frustrated with the tiniest thing.

**2 month - 2 1/2 months:** Energy is gradually coming back, digestion problems are not still 100% solved but the worst is over. Starting to dislike the smell of cigarette smoke again.

**2 1/2 months onwards:** Energy is back and quite strong, no need to smoke while out with friends (which was typically my weak point in the past), and really happy that I quit. Started taking up meditation and mindfulness as an alternative when I need to break from stressful things happening around me. Its a great way to make an excuse to go out for a walk and get some fresh air which is something I used to use cigarettes for before.



Overall my advice to people trying to quit is this: 1. value your body and recognize that smoking is a form of self-disrespect which you can choose to remove from your life 2. tell your friends and family you are quitting in order to get some support and for people to "keep you in check" 3. understand that all negative side effects will pass, no matter how annoying and severe they are (in case you can always consult your doctor) 4. give yourself positive feedback whenever you reach a particular milestone (the Smoke Free app on the Apple App store was a great way for me to get some perspective on how well I was doing and the benefits of that decision) 5. if you fear the withdrawal symptoms, do not rely on aids such as nicotine gum and spray as these will just delay it. You will feel that you are doing a lot of progress and as soon as you drop these crutches you will face the most difficult part of quitting. (learned from a previous experience trying to quit)

For any of you getting ready to quit, I hope this gave you some insight on what quitting might be like for you as well and I wish you the best of luck in your attempts!

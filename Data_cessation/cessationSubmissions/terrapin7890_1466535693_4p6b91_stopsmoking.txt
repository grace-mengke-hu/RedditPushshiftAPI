I'll try once more...

I posted here a few years back and proudly proclaimed that I was quitting cigarettes.  I had gone seven days (my longest attempt) and I failed.  Now I'm here once more and trying again.  Cold Turkey.  I'm almost 48 hours in.  
To anyone else who has quit...  How did you stick it out for the long haul?

I used to look down on those of you that posted about being able to quit for a day

I’m sorry. I’m sorry I ever thought it was pathetic to be able to quit for more than 24 hours. I know now I’m a terrible person, who had to learn the hard way, that smoking is way more addictive than I thought. When I first started, I was able to stop for 6 months. I was so arrogant about it, assuming that I had extreme will power to go cold turkey for so long. So I went back. And now...now—I can’t even fucking go one day. Not even a single god damn day... It’s what I get for judging those of you strong enough to stop for what seems like one endless day. It really does seem endless at times, to the point where I find myself wasting away another 10 bucks around midnight just to smoke 4 cigarettes, then throw the pack out in fury. I now hope I can be as strong as some of you all...one day.

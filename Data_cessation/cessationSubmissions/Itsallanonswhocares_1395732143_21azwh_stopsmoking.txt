Well I got this far, but I've backslid, and I'm smoking again. It's frustrating, I almost cracked the year and now I'm back to the start. :(

Other parts of my life have been difficult and I've been cutting out other elements of my life that are worse for me than tobacco. I guess I missed the comfort of it, no doubt I'll get tired of it again, but it's sad that I got so far and now I'm back to square one.

Sheeeeit.

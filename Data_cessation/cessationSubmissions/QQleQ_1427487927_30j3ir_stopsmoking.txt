I'm having a tough time..

Damn.
I just had a great dinner with loads of great red wine and I'm struggling so bad... I know my other half is out with the dog and smoking right now and I'm stuck inside just waiting for this enormous craving to pass... I know it will eventually but this is by far the biggest I've had.. and it's taking every bit of willpower I have not to go out right now and light up.

Just wanted to rant here and see if it helps. Atleast another few minutes have passed writing this..

I'm rather proud of myself.

This morning driving into the parking lot for work I ended up hitting the curb and ruining a tire. I parked and realized there was nothing I could do at that point I had to go to work. So I did, last time I had a car issue I messed up and started smoking. I told myself I deserved it for having to start commuting by bus again. On average I spent close to four hours a day on the bus.  I wanted to bum a smoke so bad just to deal with the stress. I almost did, but thankfully I stopped. I didn't. I bought a soda instead. Which still not healthy but out of the two I went with the lesser of two evils. 

With the exception of really close friends at work I know I wasn't pleasant to be around today. It was worth it to know I finally hit a big stress point and I didn't smoke. The AAA guy even mentioned how nice my car smelled and how bad another car was with an overflowing ashtray. So there you have it, I really feel like I'm going to stick to it this time. I don't know if the random cravings ever fully go away but I know I don't need it.

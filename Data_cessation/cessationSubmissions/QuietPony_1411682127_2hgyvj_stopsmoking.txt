Mentioned to a friend that I was quitting. She offered to give me a complimentary acupuncture treatment.

It was awesome.  Having a chest cold already,  I could feel my lungs jump start into healing writing minutes of the needles going in.. and the chest rattle that made me cough that I had for days dwindled to almost nothing.  The smoking cessation pressure points are in your ear which was a little weird.  Not as weird however as the seed things she suck with tiny band aids to the pressure points just inside my outer ear. I can push on them if a craving gets out if hand.  Strange.  I've never been acupuntured before.  10/10 would acupuncture again.

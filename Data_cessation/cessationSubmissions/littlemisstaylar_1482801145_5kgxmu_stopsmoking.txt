[ADVICE] The most unsuccessful quitter (me)

I'm a bit at my wit's end here and would LOVE some advice from those who have successfully quit smoking.

I feel like I've tried everything: cold turkey; tapered quitting; quitting while vaping; nicotine gum; throwing away all lighters and ashtrays in the house; not smoking in the car; chewing sunflower seeds; chewing gum; only smoking when I drink alcohol; never buying, only bumming; finding something to distract my hands and eyes when cravings hit; writing down cravings, their triggers, and alternate activities to smoking for each different one; listing pros and cons and keeping it around to always see that the benefits outweigh what I'm giving up; etc, etc, etc. I'm unsuccessful every time. The longest I've gone is 8 months, but going right back to it was nothing. Most of the time I don't even last 2 days.

I'm 25, I've been smoking since I was 16, and I'd really like to stop. I know how bad it is for me and I know how much better I feel when I don't. I like smoking, which I think is the biggest issue. I know I need to stop, but I like it, so I have a really hard time not doing it. I'm a fairly disciplined person, not predisposed to addiction (no family history, I mean)etc. Went 6 months without drinking socially this past year just because I wanted to. I just can't seem to kick this. I have **plenty** of good (*really* good) reasons to quit but I really can't shake the whole "instant gratification > long term reward" mentality with this. I go through waves where I like it more than I want to quit, and vice versa, and it's maddening. My resolve fluctuates on a daily basis and I can't figure out why.

Reddit, help a girl out. She desperately needs it.

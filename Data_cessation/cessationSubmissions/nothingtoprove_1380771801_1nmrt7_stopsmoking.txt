CEO shook my hand

First of all...60 days, woohoo!

Something pretty cool happened today at work, but first a little backstory.

The past few years, my company has made a pretty big deal about wellness, and has made quite a few resources available for smoking cessation, fitness coaching, and so on.  It's pretty badass, to be honest!

Anyway, the CEO of the company was at my office today meeting with clients and I was chatting with him a bit while they were between meetings.  He's a damned nice guy anyway, but I mentioned that I was 2 months smoke-free and he gave me a big smile and a handshake and (in a thick Boston accent) told me how great that was and to keep it up!

Sometimes it's the little things :-)

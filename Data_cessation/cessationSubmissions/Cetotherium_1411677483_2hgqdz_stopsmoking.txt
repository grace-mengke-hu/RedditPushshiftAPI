144 hours with no nicotine, feeling worse than ever.

I feel completely overwhelmed today, the anxiety was getting to be so much I decided it would be best to leave work before I had a breakdown. Now I just feel completely miserable. 

When does it get better? I thought the worst of it was supposed to be over with?

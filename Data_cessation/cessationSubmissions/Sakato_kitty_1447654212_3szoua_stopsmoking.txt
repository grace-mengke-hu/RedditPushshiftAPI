Today, I am smoke free for five days and it feels incredible.

I have absolutely loathed every cigarette I smoked in the past six months. I tried multiple ways of quitting but the cravings always got the best of me and I was right back to hating myself for smoking. 

My mom is dying of COPD, weighs 80lbs, on oxygen full time, has two years to live and is under the age of 60. She was diagnosed two years ago when she collapsed at work and was rushed to hospital. She tried to quit after that but like most of her other quits it didn't stick. I have been so angry at her for not quitting and choosing this fucking dried plant over living to see her grandchildren but I realized something. I am just as bad. I struggle to quit and I have been smoking half as long as her. 

Well five days ago I finally started taking the champix prescribed to me back in January that I have been too chicken shit to take. 

What would I do if it actually worked? 

What am I going to do without my best friend and companion nicotine? 

You know the one that makes me leave my house in a blizzard to pick him up at the store. The one that makes me smell fucking awful and feel like the leper of society. The one congesting my lungs and  slowly suffocating me. The one who costs almost $300 a month. Yah, I think I'm good without him.

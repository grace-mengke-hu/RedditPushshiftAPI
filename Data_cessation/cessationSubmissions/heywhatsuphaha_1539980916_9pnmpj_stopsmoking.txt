Had a smoke after a fight

Got into a verbal argument over text with my dad and felt bad and shitty for the rest of the day. Had a slim cigarette because I was nervous as I was calling him to apologize. Felt really bad and shitty the entire day. Got to talk to him and apologize. Sometimes I just can’t control my words and anger. It feels like at some points I’m in control and see things with clarity and have patience, at others I’m just mean, rude, no patience and hurtful to others. I feel bad and I guess it’s time to reset my badge.

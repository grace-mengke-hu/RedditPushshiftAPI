Thanks for creating this subreddit

I'm 21 and have smoked for 5 years, I've tried several times to quit but the cravings always catch me and draw me back in. After reading many motivating posts about how to combat this and that I'm not alone I believe I can do it, in fact I know I can do it.
This subreddit has been great help and offers a lot of advice, I'm hoping this will help me steer clear from resetting my badge

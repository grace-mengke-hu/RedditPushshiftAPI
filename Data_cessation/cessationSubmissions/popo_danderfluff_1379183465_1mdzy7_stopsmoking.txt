Why not?

As I am currently sick (sore throat and a cold, if nothing else), and also I've been thinking for a long time about quitting, I've decided to give it a go. I'll stop by here to get some advice (I already feel like shit due to the cold, so I'm trying to get a head start :) )

Method: cold turkey
Goals: 
1. shortterm - in about 2-3 months I can save up to buy an electric guitar, as opossed to burning that money, 
2. long term - I'd like to be there for my kids in as good as shape as I can manage, once they're all on a way and born and start to grow up :)

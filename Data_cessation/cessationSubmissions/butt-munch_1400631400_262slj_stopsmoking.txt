So here goes something

 Today, I am taking back control of my life. I am quitting. I am scared because this will be my fourth try. I hope it is my last. 

 Here are a few reasons why I will be quitting.
 
 My health. I am 27 years old. I have now been smoking heavily for over 9 years. Today I was carrying a 40 pound box up a flight of stairs and I was totally winded when I reached the top. I thought, this is ridiculous. I hate feeling sapped of energy. I hate feeling weak. I can do more. 

 My girlfriend. She has been more than patient with me. She wanted me to quit when we got together--over 9 months ago--and I've only broken promises to her up until this point. It makes me feel guilty. I don't want to lie to her or break promises or fail because of my own weaknesses. I love her, and I want to be my best for her. Plus, in the past when I've quit for 2-3 weeks, I noticed a significant difference in my sex drive. My dick even felt like it was hanging lower. So there's that perk. Which is awesome. 

 I've lurked in this wonderful sub for a while now, but now I'm asking for support. I'm asking for tips. I do not want to fail, and I know that many of you have gone through this experience. I'll see you around. And I'll do everything I can to stick around.

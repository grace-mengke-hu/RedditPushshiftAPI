Almost 2 years in, wanted to offer encouragement to everyone.

I smoked a pack a day for years. I was able to successfully quit about two years ago. Take a look at this: http://i.imgur.com/aLQEdGf.jpg

Some people can do it through willpower, I wasn't. 

I took Chantix 3 times over 2 years. Trust me, it works INCREDIBLY well. I don't work for them and actually dislike commercial pharmacology for the most part, but this is one of the exceptions. 

Each time I did it, within a month I wasn't smoking anymore. The problem wasn't the drug but my surroundings. 

The first time, my roommate was a smoker too. When I quit he didn't and that eventually led me back to smoking a couple months later. The 2nd time was similar, just social surroundings. 

The last time, I was sick of smoking but couldn't quit. I was out of work at the time but just made the decision to invest the money I had to the minimal 3 month treatment. Sometime in February 2 years ago I had my last cigarette. 

If you're having trouble quitting, be aware of what your triggers are. It might be you're at the bar and your friends are going for a smoke break and you don't want to be left out. It's ok to chill at the bar for a minute on your phone till they get back. Figure out what yours are and try to compensate for them. 

The other thing I've found to be helpful is the app I took the screenshot from. It's an iOS app called Quit It. I filled it out with my info the day I had my last cig and it tells me at a glance how far I've come, money saved, and cigarettss missed. 

If you are like I was, consider that at a pack a day in the last 2 years you have smoked over 13 THOUSAND cigarettes. That is insane and real. 

Good luck everyone.

First paycheck in months. So hard not to buy a pack.

Haven't posted here before but I thought now would be a good time to start.

I haven't worked in almost a year and used the lack of income to drop cigarettes from my life completely about two and half months ago. However, I finally got a job a couple weeks back and I'm finding it increasingly difficult not to buy a pack. "It's just one pack, it won't hurt. It's only about $6, too, no big deal." I know I don't want to start smoking again, but I'm having a hard time keeping that from happening anyway. Any advice?

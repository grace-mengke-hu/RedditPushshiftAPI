Day 20 and it seems to be a little harder than I thought.

As I posted before, I quit after almost 11 years of a pack a day. I am 26 almost. I have lived most of my life as a smoker. I really have to learn to deal with my life without nicotine. 

The funny thing is that I quit when getting my wisdom teeth removed. I was supposed to abstain for 48 hours and just sort of said "hey, let's see if I can stick with it for longer". 

The first week I felt great. Painkillers numbed my withdrawal symptoms and I spent an entire week at home in bed. But now that I am just going about my days in my usual fashion, I think I am getting a lot of cravings, I doubt my decision constantly and am not so excited about being a non smoker anymore. I try to stay positive and concentrate on the good parts but I am surrounded by smokers. My flatmates, my mom, my co-workers. I envy them, in a weird way. I am very irritable and jumpy. I always think about lighting one up. I never go through with it out of a toxic mix of ego and fear of failure. But I end up just getting more and more frustrated.

I hate the smell of ashtrays and smokers' breath and clothes but I just sort of miss the habit. I know smoking would not make me feel better, but I just want to feel normal again, and not feel like I am abstaining from something everyday. I want to just not think about it. 

Sorry for the loooong whining, I just needed to vent a bit.

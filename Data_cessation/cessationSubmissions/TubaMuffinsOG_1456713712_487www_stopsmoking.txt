28 Days Later...

Pack/day for 13 years. I have tried to quit probably about 6 times. This time has been different. For anyone struggling, just keep trying new things. I've tried patches, gum, lozenges, Allen Carr, vaping, cold turkey, this sub, apps. It took a few years once I decided I no longer liked smoking for it to get to this point where I don't even feel like a smoker, I am happy to be smoke free and feel great. Exercising daily, recognizing the improvements in my health and relationships, watching how much I'm saving keeps me going. I feel probably 10% as good as someone that's never smoked, but I feel 100x better than I ever did as a smoker.

The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago, the second best time is today.

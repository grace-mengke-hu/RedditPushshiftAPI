Im building up the courage to quit..

Hey everyone,

My name is Niels and I am a 22 year old student from the Netherlands currently doing an internship in Spain. Since I am alone, and not really enjoying my internship too much I am really afraid to quit, I'm really enjoying the smoking breaks in between every few hours during work to get my mind of things and get me through the day. I also enjoy smoking outside of the work, because I can kill some time and keep myself and my mind busy. I smoke about a pack a day, ive been smoking for like 6 or so years. 

Can someone share these feelings or the experience of wanting to quit but being too afraid? How did you get over it? should I just quit or should I wait for better circumstances? 

Thanks in advance!

2 days, feeling excited and hopeful for the future! But tomorrow I'll return to work...

And it's a different animal. So far I've forced myself to go out with friends, and even today I went to a restaurant, had a good meal and didn't even think about the nasty thing. But tomorrow at work will be tough. I have my routine, in the morning always a coffee with a cig, then the break, then lunch, then another break... feel like I can slip at any point

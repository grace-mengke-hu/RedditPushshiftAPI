Smoke-free for 9 Days

Hey guys. I'm happy I found this place. Now, I can read some of your stories and use them to help me stay on this path. I've smoked for 8 years. I lied to myself thinking still, one-a-day wouldn't hurt. Then, you look back and realize that you have no real way of dealing with stress. 


I called our state's quit-line and they sent me Nicotine Lozenges. I wrote in my notes app a ton of strategies for overcoming the cravings. I'm doing a lot, is all I can say. 


I have no urge for a cigarette anymore, but I have definitely felt the urge to suck on a nicotine lozenge. I love that I don't feel clogged up by smoke, I have more energy and I just feel cleaner. It's just that for some odd reason, if I had a lozenge every other hour for about 4 hours, I feel weirdly dirty like I had a cigarette. 


I would love to get off the lozenges too. So, from now on, I'm cutting them down to 2 a day... Pray for me. I can't wait to be done with this, I've been trying for so long.

How much damage have i done with 1600 cigarettes

22 years old and i've smoked for just under a year. I want to quit, at least temporarily, but i've smoked around 80 packs. Have to say, after trying it, i can say it's pretty shitty, i spent money just to feel like shit and my health doesn't feel great either. If i quit now and get back on a healthy diet / lifestyle / exercise regimen will i be ok ?

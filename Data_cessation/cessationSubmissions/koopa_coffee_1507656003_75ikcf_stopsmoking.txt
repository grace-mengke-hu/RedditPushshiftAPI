Proud of myself this evening

I'm still only on 3 1/2 days without smoking but it has been a big challenge so far. I had such an irritable weekend (smoked my last in the early hours on Saturday before bed and when I woke up hungover and without smokes decided that was it) but today on the journey home from work I was so close to succumbing and buying a pack. I battled through it and said no to to the nicotine demon inside me as I am so determined to give up. Just feeling fresher already and having a better taste to enjoy food is making me want to keep quitting as well as the fact that I know there is no benefit to smoking whatsoever.

The big challenge will be this Saturday. I'm meeting a friend for a few drinks and he is a heavy smoker. Normally in the past when we've met up we'll have a few drinks and smokes and then end up for most of the evening sat outside in the beer garden drinking heavily and chain smoking.

I don't know if I'll be strong enough to withstand the cravings after I've had a few drinks. Any tips from other ex-smokers?

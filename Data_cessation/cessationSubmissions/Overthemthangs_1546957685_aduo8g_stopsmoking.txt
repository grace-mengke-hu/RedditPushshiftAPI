Cold turkey straight off juul or switch to lower nicotine and then cold turkey?

Right now I smoke just over one 5% (50mg) juul pod per day. I was a pack a day cig smoker for about 3 years, and have been vaping for 3 years aswell. In the near future I will be looking to quit smoking all together, and I was wondering if I should lower my nicotine to a 3mg juice over the course of a week or two before I fully go cold turkey?

Looking to make withdrawals as bearable as possible to give myself the best shot at actually being done with this habit.

Day One, again..

It's day one again. I think this time it's for good. I began smoking when I was 16, quit for three years when I was 21, started again about a year ago while going through a particularly stressful period. After only a few weeks I was smoking almost half a pack a day again. In the last six months I've tried to quit cold turkey a handful of times, but only made it about four or five days before caving. This time I weaned myself down to one cigarette a day for the past week. The one I smoked last night wasn't even enjoyable, it was disgusting. I've been reading (or rather listening to) Allen Carr's Easy Way. It's pretty damn good. I'm feeling good right now having not smoked at all today, but I know that can be fleeting. The next few days may prove to be difficult, but I've quit worse things, and through some breathing and meditation I can detach somewhat from physical craving, at least enough to see the nonsensical hoops my mind jumps through to get me to smoke. I think this time it might work. Just wanted to post so it feels more official. I already told some friends to hold me accountable. Thanks.

Did quitting improve the health of your hair?

Planning on quitting soon. Been using a juul (not the same Ik, still a nicotine fiend) for about a year. I’ve been suffering from hair loss, especially thinning hair. I’m currently on finasteride to help, but I did some digging and found that nicotine can accelerate hair loss. Has anyone that quit noticed an improvement in the health of their hair?

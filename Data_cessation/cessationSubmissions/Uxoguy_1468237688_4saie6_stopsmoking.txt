Pack a day for over a month now.

My wife's left me for another man, and I have dove face first back into smoking. Before, I could easily put everything down, but now it's just claws in my back. I haven't been eating (lost 80 pounds since march) and I just pace in the garage and smoke while I'm off work, I chainsmoke at work while on break. I want to put them down again, because I don't want my daughter seeing me smoke, and I want to be healthy, but with zero appetite, constant anxiety and depression, does anyone have any good advise for me. I know I should be eating, exercising, and all of that, but smoking, pacing, and my mind going 450 miles per hour is more of a common trend no matter how much I don't want to do it.

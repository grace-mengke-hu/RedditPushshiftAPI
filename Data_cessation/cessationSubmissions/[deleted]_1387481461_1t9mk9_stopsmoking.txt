Did my time in the desert

Nearly gave up yesterday, but I managed to avoid buying smokes when filling up my car last night.

So I've crossed the 40 day mark now, and I learned that for me, smoking was not an addiction so much as it was habitual behaviour. The only time I miss it is when I'm driving. Luckily my new job is within walking distance, so there is less of an urge to smoke or opportunity to buy.

As long as I can avoid long solitary drives in the near future, I think I will be fine.

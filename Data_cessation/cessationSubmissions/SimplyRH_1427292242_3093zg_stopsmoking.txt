Hi, I'm a cold-turkey quitter on his 100th day without any form of nicotine. AMA

Ladies and gentlemen, as I live and breathe (deeply) I am proud to sit here and say without pause that today marks 100 days without even a hint of nicotine. No patches. No vapes. No easy-way. Straight up cold turkey. 

I implore those who are struggling with the idea of quitting, or maybe are holding on by a thread to their quit just hours later to pick my brain. Ask me anything. If I can help even one person make it another day without smoking, I'll consider it a success.

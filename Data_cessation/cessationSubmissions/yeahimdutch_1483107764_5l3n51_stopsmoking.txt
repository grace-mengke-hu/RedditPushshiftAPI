YAY 60 Days, time for some reflection!

Hey /r/stopsmoking!

I quit 60 full days! and I absolutely love it! Here are some of my reflections on the 60 days of quitting. Also you lurkers who are on here, I was a lurker once too! If I can do it, you can certainly do it as well!

1. Smell: At first you get overwhelmed with all the smells of the world, by now I'm used to it. Food tastes better, but smelling my girlfriend for the first time in 1,5 years was kind of a revelation for me.

2. ERECTIONS you don't read much about it here but boy, I have bigger, harder and more often erections. So if you have trouble with getting them quitting is certainly a pro.

3. Food: SO much better, I love food, at first I thought it was something that needed to be done, but not anymore! I enjoy it so much more now.

4. Energy: I have way more energy then I had before, this includes sleeping. At first I couldn't sleep very well, but now the quality of my sleep is better then ever. I wake up well rested in stead of tired.

5. Money, obviously more money left at the end of the month.

6. Time, I don't have to build my time around smoking anymore. I didn't notice until quitting that my smoker friends need to take "breaks" for everything. For example, playing a board game and all the non smokers have to wait and sit :(

Now some negatives:

GAS I have GAS oh my I hope that stops soon, and that's about it.

If you have any questions please feel free to do so!

This is my 5th quit, smoked almost a pack a day and smoked for 11 years. Good luck on you new years quitters and soon to be quitters!

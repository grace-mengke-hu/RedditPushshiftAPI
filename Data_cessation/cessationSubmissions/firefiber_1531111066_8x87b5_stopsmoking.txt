Nothing else interests me after work - just coming home to smoke.

I just had a smoke after waking up. I usually don't, but there was a pack that I didn't throw up. 

Here's my cycle - go to work, come home, debate with myself, addiction wins, buy pack, smoke one or two, and then throw the pack. Repeat. I used to smoke way more, but have cut down to maybe two or three a day. I can't seem to quit that though - when I get home from work, it just feels like some part of my brain has made everything I actually love doing seem uninteresting, so I'm only left with smoking. And if I don't, it feels like the day is incomplete, that there's something I should do before bed. I know this sounds crazy, but I don't know how to fight it. 

When I get home from work today, what should I do? I love programming, gaming, reading, drawing - but none of these things interest me then, they all seem like work. Compared to how easy it is to have a smoke. There would be so many reasons my mind would come up with. That I've had a bad day so it's okay to smoke. That I'm stressed so it's okay to have just one. 

Please help!

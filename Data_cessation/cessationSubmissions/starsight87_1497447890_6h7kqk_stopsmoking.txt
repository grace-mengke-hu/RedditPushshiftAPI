40 Days!

Something about nice round numbers that help you to feel good about the process. Everyday feels like a victory and it has encouraged me to work on the areas of my life that have been lacking: 

1) I am continuing my running program and about 3/4 of the way to running 5K 

2) I am 4 days into quitting drinking and feel great with the decision. 

3) I am continuing my astrophotography and learn more with my telescope each night that it is clear 

This was one of the great decisions I made in my life and today it has empowered me.

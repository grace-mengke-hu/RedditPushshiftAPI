Whew! This crying...

Hi,
Today is 4 weeks smoke-free! I am really proud of myself and am still very motivated about my quit. But, I have had such sadness since last night - crying hard, unconsolable, sad sad crying. I really thought that part -short temper and sudden sadness - was in the past! And man! this shit is HARD to deal with. Dare I say, the hardest of all?
The biggest consolation is that I know this will not last, it's not permanent and I will get past it. Can you tell me how long the emotional upset or mood disturbances lasted for you? Keeping in mind that 40% of ex-smoker will have withdrawal symptoms past the 4 week mark.
Thank you.
Also - is this different for men and women? The crying or the anger?

A TEST! (Spoilers: a passed motherfuckers)

Day 2. 

Faced a MAJOR hurtle today. 

My car insurance is up. It is PAST TIME to renew or get new insurance. 

I JUST SPENT THE LAST TWO HOURS ON THE PHONE WITH THE INSURANCE COMPANY!! I AM SO FUCKING FRUSTRATED I WANT TO PUNCH A GRANDMA! 

Here the thing though... I never got up, not once, to smoke while on the phone (something I used to think I couldn't even accomplish). I also got off the phone and found that not only did the frustration disapate rather quickly but that i feel GREAT for not giving into the WHISPERINGS of the BEAST. 

I know it was him, at the back of my head the last two hours... It was HIM making me more frustrated than I should have been. It was him making me sweat for no real reason. For whispering that if only I could puff my way through this frustrating phone call it would be better and easier... 

Truth is it won't. 

The problem will still be just as frustrating and stupid AFTER i smoke a cigarette. Only WORSE because I'll have fed into the BEAST. AND I'll have spent 7 bucks on a pack of DEATH.

SO FUCK YOU BEAST! 

AND FUCK YOU CAR INSURANCE!  

Frustration vented. Glad I'm a non-smoker. Still hate all forms of car insurance. 

I won. The Beast can suck a fuck!

Quit, started again, quitting again tomorrow

I quit for about 3 months before picking up again after a night of heavy drinking.  I’m quitting again tomorrow.  Wish me luck.  Also, I’m not sure if that “number of days quit” thing will be on my name, but it’s not accurate.  Anybody know how to change it.

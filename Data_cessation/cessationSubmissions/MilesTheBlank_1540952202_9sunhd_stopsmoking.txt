I need help to stop my dad from smoking

So my dad stopped smoking for about 10 years then he started again about 3 years ago. I haven't said anything to him because I don't have the courage. My mom freaks out all the time about. I tried talking to my mom to get him to start vaping, she says it's not safe. I agreed with her and said it's not safe but it's safer. She said no and it pissed me off a bit that she didn't understand what an addiction and how to stop it. He just wants him to stop instantly but she doesn't understand that not possible for an addict. Well, I need help getting to my mom so she can help me end my dad smoking addiction.

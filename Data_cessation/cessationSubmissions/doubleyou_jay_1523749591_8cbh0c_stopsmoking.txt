Antisocial

I hit 2 months tomorrow and it feels good. That said I’m still feeling very anti social. Biggest problem currently and since quitting is I get anxiety being out and in social situations. I think most of them(like everything else) I associate with smoking so it’s easier to just be home.  I’m finding it’s starting to hurt my general outlook and relationships. At first it gradually got better but now it seems to be stagnant and not getting better. Anyone have anything similar?

I'm Starting Over. Again.

I started smoking after I broke up with my ex boyfriend of 5 years. A year later, and cigarettes are consuming my life. I'm really intimidated with going cold turkey but I got a family to support and I can't afford to get sick (or die because of it eventually). So I'm starting tonight, and I know this will be a day to day battle, but I'm ready!

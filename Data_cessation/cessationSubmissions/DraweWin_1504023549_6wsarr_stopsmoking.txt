The Structure of Smoking Addiction

If you go back in your memory to the last time you smoked - if you go just before that memory in time - you'll discover 3 universal experiences from whom at least one occurred for you.

When you think back on what happened - there was an emotion within your physical body that felt as if you need to smoke right now at all cost.  
There maybe was a voice that told you things or made you feel like  you need to smoke.  
You maybe looked at a memory in the form of a visual picture or mental movie that basically told you to smoke.  
The voice and images are recurrent, the emotion is uncontrollable. 

This means that if you know how to instantaneously control and shift your emotional state, if you know how to rapidly alter the pictures and sounds in your head so that the change stays - you'll be able to STOP SMOKING within 20 seconds because you'll collapse the internal structure of the smoking addiction. 

You can also send a DM with your facebook, skype or discord ID, within 15 minutes i can explain how exactly to control emotions and change the pictures &amp; sounds within you. As a gift you'll gift me a $45 gift.

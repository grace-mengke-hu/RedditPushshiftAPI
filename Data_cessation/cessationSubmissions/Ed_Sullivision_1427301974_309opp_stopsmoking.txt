So this is day 5. Here are some thoughts that have been rattling around in my brain.

I feel tired and restless. I've been acting like a cranky asshole to my roommates and friends, I feel annoyed much more quickly. But I'm very happy I've made it this far. Last night some friends came over for some beers and I didn't smoke! I went out back with them, probably got some secondhand smoke unfortunately, but it's better than lighting up. 

I've only told one person I'm quitting. I feel like letting everyone know just adds pressure. I'm kind of looking forward to this grand reveal where I can say I quit when someone notices I haven't smoked a cigarette in front of them in awhile. But I'm still kinda worried about my first weekend as a non-smoker. Fortunately I get a break this weekend because I'm going on a trip with my little brother who doesn't smoke and has never known I smoke, so there will be very little pressure or cravings. Hopefully by next weekend I'll be more used to being a non-smoker and pull through those tipsy weekend nights. I'll probably cut down my alcohol intake too to make it easier on myself. 

The hardest part of this is I'm having trouble convincing myself cigarettes are disgusting. I started smoking at 18 because I was a stupid kid who basically wanted to look cool. All my heroes smoked, I wanted to be edgier and taken more seriously. Now if I see someone smoking in a movie or TV show, I still get that same warm and fuzzy feeling. I get cravings if I even read about someone smoking in a novel. I'm still a fucking sucker for bullshit glamorization of smoking. I need to be able to say "Fuck cigarettes" and believe it.

Thanks for reading ya'll, this subreddit is helping a lot.

I've gone about six and a half months without smoking a cigarette - and I want one more than anything right now.

I smoked a pack a day for a few years, cut back to half a pack or less per day for about three more years, and eventually to chain-smoking anywhere between five cigarettes to half a pack once or twice a month while out drinking (in between dates when I tried to abstain), or having a few cigarettes a week for a few months (toward the end there, regrettably). It has been more than six months since I wholeheartedly gave up smoking cigarettes, and I can't describe how much of a relief it is to not have to talk myself out of a fatalistic, hypochondriac panic every evening as I lie in bed, thinking of all the damage my body has to endure because I can't control my impulses. For the most part, I have been able to manage my cravings by conjuring up images of Carrian nicotine demons to pride myself on not depending on nicotine to be whole, or by appealing to the logical part of my brain with aphoristic mantras, or by forcing myself to go on a bike ride so that I can lose my breath and raise my heart rate and remind myself how nice it is to know that my lungs are healing and my heart is doing what it is supposed to be doing and that I am not dying slowly and methodically by my own hand. Anyway, I took a trip with my mom last weekend, and started having really powerful cravings for a smoke - I think relaxing in a new environment in her company was a huge trigger for me, as I've traveled many times with her as a smoker, and always enjoyed the little breaks I could find after meals or early in the morning, to suck on a cigarette and revel in my temporary solitude. Can someone offer me any words of encouragement, or advice, here? The cravings haven't gone away, and it's been a few days. I would be supremely disappointed in myself for succumbing to my desire to light up a cigarette after all of this effort, and know that I will be flooded with regret and anxiety the moment I put it out. Still, nothing sounds better than a cigarette right now.

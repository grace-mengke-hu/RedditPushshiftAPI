12th day

Hey guys. I’m 12 days into my quit, and I find it hard not to smoke. Over the last days it had got increadingly harder, with more cravings. The first days everything was smooth and I was happy that I quit. I went to parties, drank alcohol and still didn’t want to smoke. But now I started being moody, irritable and anxious because I don’t smoke. Are the cravings actually getting worse for everyone as time passes? What’s your experience?

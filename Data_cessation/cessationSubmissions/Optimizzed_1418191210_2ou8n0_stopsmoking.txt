I don't want words of affirmation, I want people to feel sorry for me

For my loss. If I never smoke again I have to say goodbye to everything I love, me. The me I identify so much with is gone. 

I don't want people to congratulate me I want them to take a deep breathe of condolence. I want them to acknowledge that quitting smoking is literally the hardest thing I've ever tried to do in my life. And, the hard part lasts a looong unforeseen time. I want a "time out" card from all the activities that I cope with using cigarettes.

I want to not feel like I'm dying anymore, so I have no choice, I have to quit.

relapsed after 8 weeks

First time posting on reddit. My friend recommended this subreddit. 

I'm 21 years old and at my worst I was chain smoking close to 40 cigarettes a day. Prior to the 8 weeks free, I had met a girl who made it clear that smoking was a huge turn off for her. I had been wanting to quit for so long and she helped me to finally ditch the darts. Anyway I stopped seeing that girl and on Saturday night at a party I had my first cigarette in 8 weeks, it tasted like the first one I ever had, back when I was 19. I then had another two that night. The next day (Sunday) I pinched a few out of my brother-in-law's packet, then proceeded to head off to the Uni computer labs because I had an essay due at midnight. On the way to Uni I stopped at a petrol station to grab an energy drink and to be honest with you all, to buy some cigarettes as well. Smoked about 7 then scrunched up the pack and threw them in the bin, telling myself this was only going to be this weekend. Monday came along and I bought another pack and much like Sunday smoked a few then gave them to my brother-in-law, continually telling myself: "Don't get hooked again! Don't get hooked again!" Wednesday was exactly the same, cashed in $20 worth of scratchies (scratch cards) and bought another pack, smoked a few then then destroyed the pack. Once again today was the same, I rustled some money I had lying around and bought another packet. 

Please help. I really need some advice.

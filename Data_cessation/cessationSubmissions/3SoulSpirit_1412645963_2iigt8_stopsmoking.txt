Made it through day 1!

I feel like I've had a limb amputated. Like there's something i'm forgetting to do. It doesn't feel real, probably because while I've been meaning to quit for a while, it was a snap decision to attempt to quit. Still waiting for that sense "I'm proud of myself! This is going to be easy!" to set it!

A hole that can never be filled

I realized at one point that smoking to satisfy nicotine cravings is just insanity. 

I would crave a cigarette,  so I smoked one. The craving came back a few minutes after I finished smoking. 

Try to quit? Fine. Cut back on how many you smoke. You just experience longer periods of cravings between cigarettes. 

I've quit before for several years. Even after years, I would occasionally experience a craving (after meals when I see someone else smoking is a huge trigger).

When I give in to that odd craving, I am back on the merry go round. 

Cravings are a hole that can never be filled. Might as well not waste time trying.

Quitting the 2nd time with "Easy way to stop smoking".

Yep.. I've read Allen Carrs book the first time and began to smoke again after one month.

From that experience I can tell: The "first" cigarette kills you, once you were addicted somewhen.  


It took me some years before I put my eyes in Carr's book again. So I've read it and did it like the first time (and it worked the first time pretty good without cravings and so on). He asks you only to stop when you're 100&amp;#37; sure.. and I wasn't. I also already knew what he was saying. Anyway, I smoked the last one and thats hour past now. 

And now I am craving like crazy. I know giving in would be bad, but I'm not sure if I can hold myself :D.   


**Does anyone of you have experience with this? Reading the book a second times after relapse?**   
Dunno what to do right now. Its almost like I have no chance of winning this one.

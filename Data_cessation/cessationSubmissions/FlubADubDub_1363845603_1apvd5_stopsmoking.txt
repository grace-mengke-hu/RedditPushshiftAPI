Quit today (7 hours ago) after 6 years. Every minute seems like 5 minutes.

So lately I've been waking up and hacking up some pretty nasty stuff. I went out to smoke the first of the day, and I just "felt" how unheathy I am getting on these. This might also be because I started the Slow carb diet 2 weeks ago, and have been feeling really good / disciplined on that. I put out the cig, and gave the last ones away. It's been 7 hours, and I know the worst is yet to come. I already feel these intense cravings, like being in a small room with symbols banging close to your head. (If that makes sense to you).. Thanks for reading, & feel free to leave any tips or personal stories. (Especially if you went cold turkey)

EDIT: Thanks guys, 
It's been 36 hours now. The majority of the hard cravings are gone. Fortunately i lost my debit card a few days ago, so haven't been able to slip, nor have i really wanted to. I feel a little foolish for having done that to my body/lungs/skin for so long. Can't wait to go running. Any one feel like they had better skin after quitting? Thanks again.

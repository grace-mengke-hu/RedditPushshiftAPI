Chewing?

So I've been having an urge to chew since quitting (not tobacco, just chew like a dog.) Sometimes my teeth kinda feel bord, or even like they're too sharp sorta. I've been chewing gum, but sometimes i feel like I need something more. Does anyone else have this oral fixation? And if so how do you deal with it?

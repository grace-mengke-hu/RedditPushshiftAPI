300 days today. You can do it too.

When I first found this sub I tried quitting cold turkey. I made it about a month before relapsing... I then tried to quit again using a cheap e-cig. It worked for a while -  until I went to university and picked it up again. 300 days ago I invested in a much sturdier e-cig, apart from maybe three cigarettes near the start I have managed to taper myself down to 0mg nicotine since April. I no longer get the cravings, I still vape for the amazing taste though ;)
Anyone struggling to quit should check out /r/electronic_cigarette and see if it works for them too! Good luck everyone, you can do it too!

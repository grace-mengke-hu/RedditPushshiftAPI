I'm a smoker.

I'm am so rationalizing that I'm am a smoker and I cant do this.  I feel like I'm getting ripped-off in the enjoyment department. Nothing seems as fun anymore.  I'm crabby and not my happy self. I so want to have a cocktail and a smoke. Crazy, right?  I almost stopped and bought a pack.  Almost. :(   Ugh. Could I just be a smoker?  24 days.....

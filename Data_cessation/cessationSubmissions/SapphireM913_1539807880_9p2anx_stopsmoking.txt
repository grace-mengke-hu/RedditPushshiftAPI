Unexpected Milestone

I was at the Packers/49ers game on Monday night. We have season tickets, this was probably my 5th or 6th game I've attended. All games before this I've been a smoker. This game I'm not. The steps to my seats are monstrous. Seriously, they're like up to my knee, we don't do non of these little in between steps. Power up these like a boss. Before, I'd get winded going up the steps. I wouldn't leave my seat all game because going back up them to get back was hell. This game, I was not going to make it in terms of the rest room... I HAD to go just before the end of the game. For anyone who watched it... It was a nail biting end of the game! I ran down the stairs, went to the bathroom, and RAN back up them. I was winded, but I'm also fat and sedentary. The difference was... I didn't have an asthma attack. I should've had an asthma attack, I should've been wheezing and coughing and legitimately concerned I'd continue breathing. I have always had that asthma attack before. 

Now I'm kind of curious to try other physical activities...

Cravings at this point

So, cravings are all just habitual triggers now. They are down to four or five a day, which is way better than thirty. Still staying strong  and fighting the good fight.  I have actually forgotten that I was a smoker a few times. I honestly thought that finding things to do instead of smoking was going to be hard the rest of my life. It's not though, you just slowly forget that you want a cigarette and your day goes on without it. I have about 2 more hours a day now. Woot!

Everything's fucked!

So I want to stop, I've being trying for weeks and weeks. I stopped for a year and a half since Jan 12 - Jun 14 . And it was easy after the first 9 days, from memory  a complete walk in the park. BUT only after the first 9 days, very important to say that. I was sitting in the pub earlier after not smoking from 2 days and I wasn't going insane till I had a cigarette but I was still insane before that. The problem is that you may be satisfied not smoking, but you still always think the grass is greener even if you know its not. ANy tips?

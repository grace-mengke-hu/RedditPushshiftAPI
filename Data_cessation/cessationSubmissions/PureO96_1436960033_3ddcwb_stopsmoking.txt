I messed up

I smoked half a cigarette after 3 weeks smoke-free. I'm disgusted. It wasn't enjoyable. It tasted terrible and I smell awful.
I can blame it on anxiety, I can blame it on family, I can blame it on whatever I want. But in the end I'm the one who lit the cigarette, I'm the one who inhaled. It's my fault and I take full responsibility. If I keep blaming others for my bad habit I won't get very far.
So here's to those of you who *didn't* inhale.

If you're struggling, please take my advice. It isn't worth it. It never is.

Feeling confident.

I first posted almost two days ago! Right now I’m feeling pretty good and excited for day 3! I want to update my badge, but can’t remember how to do so, maybe I’ll re-learn tomorrow! 

I woke up early today feeling really great. I had been sick for a few days, and combined with the smoking it was doing a number on my lungs. 

I managed to clean the entire house, give the dogs a bath, cook breakfast, and wash all my bedding! Three days ago around this time I was just waking up and smoking my first cigarette. 

I’m glad I made this choice!

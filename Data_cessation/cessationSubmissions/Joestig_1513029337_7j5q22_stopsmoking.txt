Don't fool yourself into thinking Januari 1 is some special day. Try quitting now!

I often used to start attempts to build good habits or break bad ones on first days of some period: first day of the year, first day of the month, first day of the semester - but now I realize how foolish that was.

There is nothing special about these days. It's just an excuse to procrastinate a bit longer! Sure, I know it's hard to quit. It took me many attempts. But you can try now and it's fine if you fail, you will learn from it. But if you keep waiting for some magic moment, and you are not successful, then it's much harder to start again, because you have to wait for the next magic moment, saying to yourself "but this time it will be different".

NO! Just try it now. There is no shame in trying and failing, you don't have to be ready. You will learn from the process if you let go of the perfectionism.

This rant is something I would have liked to tell my old self. So much time wasted. But I am trying to quit now and it seems to be going well, and I am happy about that. I wish you all the best in your attempts!

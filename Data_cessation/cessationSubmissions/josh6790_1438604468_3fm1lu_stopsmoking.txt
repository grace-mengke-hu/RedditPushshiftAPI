I finally want to

Had my last this morning when I got up. Have bought gum. And I'm ready. I'm not going to pretend I will never have another cigarette, I'm sure I'll have a couple of drinks in a couple of weeks and have one, and that's okay. Because I don't want to be a smoker any more. Looking forward to the extra Â£50 per week in my pocket more than I would any cigarette.

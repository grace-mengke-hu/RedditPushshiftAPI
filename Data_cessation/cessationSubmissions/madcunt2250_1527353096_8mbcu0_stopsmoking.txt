Cravings are not my issue when I drink.

my issue is I seem to get extremely drunk, unintentionally. Past the point of it being enjoyable. I embarrass myself. I feel emotionally unstable. I black out. Argumentive etc. 

But this has all started since i quit smoking. 
I used to feel very calm and level headed when i drank. Yeah i would have a big night every once and a while but it seems to much more frequent.

My hangovers dont feel like they used to either. I dont feel like ill be bed ridden most the day. But i do feel incredibly anxious for a whole day.

I know quiting drinking is a solution but i want to know if anyone else has similar experiences or knows why this happening

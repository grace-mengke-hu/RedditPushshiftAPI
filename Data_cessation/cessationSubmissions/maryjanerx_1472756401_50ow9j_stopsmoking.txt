After 3weeks, I back slide

Ugh, I bought a $7 pack of 100's the other day. I've only been smoking half at a time, and so far I only have 3 halves a day. I quit smoking grass too. One day at a time. So far today I've only had one half cig. I smoke enough to get the buzz and then short it for later. Good for all of you that stay strong!!!

1 week without smokes.

I made it to a week. I wish I could say I was completely free from nicotine, but God damn is it hard. I know I can post here and have some backup from you guys. I was smoking over a pack a day since I was 17. I'm only 22 now but I was already starting to notice it was having effects on how i do my job. I work in construction so it's hard to be around it all and not have an urge. I know it's unpopular here but to fill the void I started dipping. Before I get flak for it, I know it is not safer. I do know that I am planning on getting off the dip as soon as I can. 1 - 2 dips a day versus a pack a day has to be a step in the right direction.

For me it is mainly the morning craving. I plan on getting off the dip with sunflower seeds or gum. But I just wanted to say I appreciate the community here and the support. If anyone has any advice or feedback I would appreciate it.

Cheers everyone, and thank you.

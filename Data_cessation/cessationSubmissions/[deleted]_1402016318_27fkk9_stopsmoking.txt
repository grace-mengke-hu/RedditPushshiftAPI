Day four and I'm an angry eating machine

Hi people!

First post. I quit on Sunday and things have been going well, I was 1/2 pack to a pack a day (sometimes more or less depending on the day) for about 5 years. I quit Sunday. I have a full carton in my room and I'm waiting for my friend to come take them, I haven't even looked at them!

BUT, that being said, all I do is eat. I eat more than I've ever eaten before and I cannot stop it. I'm so bloated it actually hurts. I'm very irritable. I'm waiting to be located with work and I'm staying with my parents until I start. I thought the move would be a good time to quit but in reality it just makes me actually irritated by my parents, they know I smoked but never addressed it because I never smoked in front of them. I've been sitting around their house too pissed off to go outside and I'm just eating everything in sight and praying that they won't speak to me because it's annoying. This being said, my parents have always been irritating so I should have thought about that earlier (think George's parents on Seinfeld, yup, they exist). 

People I need help, how do I do this without screaming at my parents every eight seconds and without gaining double my weight? Since writing this my mother has wined at me for still eating to a point where I'm considering a stroke to be the better option.

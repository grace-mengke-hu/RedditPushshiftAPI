Persistent health anxiety, nine months since I quit cold turkey.

So, it has been a little over nine months since I quit smoking and I really thought that the anxiety about my lung heath would have gone down by now. Its not that I am having trouble breathing - in fact I am exercising more now than I have in years! Its just that no matter how good I feel the thoughts that I may have done some permanent and serious damage lingers. 

Has anyone else gone through this, and if so what helped you get over it? Are their any medical lung function tests I could look into getting to put myself at ease?

Thanks!

Quitting by vaping

So I'm one week without smoking (half a pack a day smoker for about 7 years), but I do use a vaporizer pen with 11 mg nicotine liquid. I usually take about 10-15 mouthfuls from the vaporizer per day at the most, and I try to not use it at all unless I am driving at least 20 minutes, or if I'm drinking with friends. However, I've been noticing that I feel almost as if I'm almost cheating by vaping. Thoughts on this? Health risks of vaping that anyone has read of or personally experienced?  I'm feeling conflicted about using the vaporizer but not sure I I can stay sane without it so early on after quitting cigarettes.

No more energy drinks.

So, a couple weeks into my new life as a "Sorry, I don't smoke" person, I realized something new.  I used to think that it was just that I liked drinking Monster Energy, but since I stopped smoking I don't seem to need the boost as much, and also, I now kinda hate the taste of those damned things.  Interesting....  I was probably spending as much money on carbonated, caffeinated B12 supplements as I was on smoking....  Paycheck is lasting a lot longer this time around, too.  

Imagine that.

Stay strong, friends!

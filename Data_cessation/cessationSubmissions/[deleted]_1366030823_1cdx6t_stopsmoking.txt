Today is day one. Cold Turkey.

Today is also my birthday.  I started smoking at the legal age of 18 and I am 36 today.  I've been a smoker for half of my life.  I'm at a good point in my life to quit.  Now, for the first time since I've been smoking, I am the only person at my job/in my band/and in my home life that smokes.  It's time to stop.  I am over it.   I am determined to quit and I am determined to be an inspiration to other people that are struggling with quitting.

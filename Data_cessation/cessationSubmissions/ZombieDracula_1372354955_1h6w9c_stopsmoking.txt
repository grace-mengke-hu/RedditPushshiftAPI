My badge says 360, but it's actually 50 days today since I quit quitting and then re-quit.. this is the longest time I've been able to go without a cig and I feel both awful and great.

The only hurdle I have left is divorcing cigarettes from my identity.  I have identified myself as a smoker for so long that I have lost a major portion of my self-confidence and self-actuality.  I no longer feel like "Fuck it, I can do anything! because I'll have a smoke after and it won't matter!"

But I'm getting there.. it's been difficult to re-wire my reward system and stay motivated but I've got to thank a concoction of Tostido's Lime Chips and Salsa, Coffee, An e-cigarette I use sparingly, exercise, and picking up a couple hobbies.

Anyways, I just wanted to share because I've shared on Facebook a few times now and I don't want people to think that I'm still thinking about cigs.  I really don't that much anymore and it's been awesome.  That nagging feeling that I need to leave a good situation to make it better is gone and that the part I'm most thankful for.

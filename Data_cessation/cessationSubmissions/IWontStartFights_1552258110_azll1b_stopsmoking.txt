Is stop smoking really worth it?

Just found this sub and I need some motivation. I smoke since around 9 years. I tried multiple times to stop it. My record was 5 days smoke-free. But after a pretty rough day with a lot of stress i couldn't resist anymore. So i told myself "*i don't drink alcohol, eat healthy and do sports, smoking is my only bad/unhealthy habit, so it's not that bad*". 

&amp;#x200B;

I know im lying to myself, but i feel, smoking is my only "forbidden" joy. It makes me relax and i feel like i simply can't feel good without a cigarette. I always thought "*i can stop whenever i want, it's not a big deal. I just don't do it, because i enjoy it*". Until my first attempt to stop...and i kinda just gave up. The only thing i archieved was reducing it a bit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, despite lying to myself: I really wanna stop smoking, thats for sure.

So pls tell me what has changed in your life, taking the money you save aside, since you stopped smoking? How did you do it? I slowly reducing it an option or should i stop it immediately?

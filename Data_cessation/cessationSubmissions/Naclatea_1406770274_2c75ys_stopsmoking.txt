2 Days Nicotine Free

Well i started smoking 16 years ago, after a lot of fail "quitting smoking" 2 months ago i bought an ecig, and 2 days ago it broke, i didn't replace it, now i am at day 2 without any nicotine and the best part is i think  i don't need it anymore, i don't have that anxiety attacks, hunger, or anger, i think that thank God i am finally able to stop smoking

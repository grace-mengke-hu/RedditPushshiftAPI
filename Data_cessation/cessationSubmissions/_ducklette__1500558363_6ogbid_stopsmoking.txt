Got bad news, but didn't smoke to relieve the sadness

I have two pets rats which I deeply love, however they are against our lease, and while doing maintenance the apartment found them and sent a notice saying we had an unregistered pet which was breaking our lease.

Now we have to give them away and my heart is breaking. I got home after hearing the news and wept. I sat and wept. 

My partner is an occasional smoker while drinking, and we have a pack of cigarettes.

But, I didn't smoke. I wept, and then got up, went to the store, came home and cooked dinner.

Another one of those moment where I previously would have turned to cigarettes because it was something I thought I could choose that would make me feel good for a little bit. It's funny how much I had used smoking as a crutch for dealing with bad feelings, or a way to escape my reality for a bit.

Just sharing my success story

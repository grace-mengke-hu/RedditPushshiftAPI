Tips or advice would be welcome!

I started smoking when I was stressed out my senior year of high-school. I've always been able to "quit" when the stress was gone, but started back when the stress level got to a point I couldn't handle. I kept this up for years, and I was able to stop when I got over the stress. 

More recently, I have dealt with a lot of stress, and I realized today that I get irritable when I haven't smoked in a while. I've noticed that when I am feeling pretty at ease, I go out to smoke and it's become more of a habit than "Oh, I'm just stressed out. A couple cigs will calm me down." 

My husband absolutely hates the habit, and it really disappoints him when I smoke. I was really OK with smoking, as long as I was able to stop, but not I do not think I will able to quit like I used to. I don't really know where to start. I've been smoking about a pack every 3ish days. I know I haven't smoked for that long (in the grand scheme of things) but cigarettes have been my stress relief for a long time

How did you start to quit?

2 days away from 6 months smoke free!

I can't even believe it! I smoked for close to 15 years, I can't believe I stopped. I've had my days where I question it, where I miss it, where I really just want to go buy a pack and every time I think of my daughter. 

You know they say your more likely to smoke if your parents do. My whole family still smokes, but reading everyone's posts about their struggles to stop, remembering my multiple tries and failures, than looking at this beautiful baby next to me and wanting for her to never experience that. That is why I will never give in, she is my motivation. I hope to save her from this never ending shame of wanting to stop smoking and the addiction dragging you down again and again. My hope is that because of my choices now she will never have to experience this special hell that all of you understand all too well. I'm thankful I was finally able to stop and I am thankful she gives me the willpower to continue to stay stopped even on my weakest days. Everyday I have to make my decision and most days it's not any easier than the last, but she helps me make it worth the fight.

Here is to a soon to be 6 months, and my thoughts go out to all of you still trying, you just need to find that motivation, whatever it may be, I hope you can latch on to a thought so strong it helps you achieve your goals.

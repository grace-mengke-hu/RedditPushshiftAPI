Just finalising my desicion

Hi all I'm new here. So I've been in the process of quitting smoking for a few months now. And ultimatley it's gone really well, I'm barely smoking now unless I'm drinking, and even then I may only have a few (I tend to stick with my vape now anyway).

But I've made the desicion that I want to completley give up drinking as well as smoking too, and I thought that I would stick around here to help keep me on with it.

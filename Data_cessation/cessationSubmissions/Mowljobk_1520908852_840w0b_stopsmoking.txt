Im on the third week

And it feels great, I have cravings from time to time but very unregular and nothing I cant fight back. Its awesome and you guys helped alot. My Goal is now one month and from then on two months. But my throat is killing me at the moment, it feels like i would smoke again, did you guys have any tips or expierence in this regard. Thanks! :)

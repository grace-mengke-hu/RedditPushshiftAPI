Totally want to smoke

Tonight I have been relegated to drinking wine, laying on a heating pad, and taking prescribed Meds for back pain. I'm in day 13 of my quit. I'm feeling really good right now and I'm not in pain, but damned if I don't want to smoke right now! I won't. I don't have any, I'm not in a condition to drive, and I won't ask hubs to take me. The past few days I had been feeling better. Not many cravings and the  few I had passed quickly. But sitting here buzzed is making me want to smoke. 

It's the constant reminders of what was that get you. It's what did me in last time, but in prepared this time and I know what opening the box holds. I know I can't just have one. I know I'm not a casual smoker. I can casually do other drugs but not nicotine. It's all or nothing for me and I'm choosing nothing!

Tips to quit??

For some time now I've been looking to quit smoking cigarettes but it's only today that I've only smoked one cigarette in the morning I usually smoke 5 a day. Today I have been using an electric cigarette vuse and chewing tobacco snuff it does help with the sensation but I want any tips if anyone knows any herbal remedies that help the sensation or over-the-counter stuff thanks guys

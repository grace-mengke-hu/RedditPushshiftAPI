For those of you about to quit or just starting your quit

I highly recommend going through Joel Spitzer's youtube chanel https://www.youtube.com/user/joelspitz, really helped me get through the first week. Understanding why people smoke was the most important thing for me. This was the first one I watched https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9AmZiI3rNI. This is my first post, hopefully it helps someone.

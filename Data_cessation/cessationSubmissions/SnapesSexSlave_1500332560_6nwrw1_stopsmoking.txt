Just quit today

I just quit today. I have been smoking about a pack and a half a day. Smoking for close to 10 years now. This is like my 5th go round at quitting. My longest stint was 7 months, and thinking I could handle smoking 1 or 2 while drinking was my down fall.  What are some tips/advice/suggestions for quitting for real without falling off the wagon? I have tried vaping but I just got addicted to that and smoked it all day long... .

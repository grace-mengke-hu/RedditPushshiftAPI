Celebrating 11 weeks today

I'm out travelling, and I have only thought of smoking very briefly, after a good meal, and once after a long trip. It wasn't even a feeling like a craving - more like a suggestion. It felt easy to dismiss, and I didn't think about it any more.

I'm sure there will be tougher days, for instance I am mentally preparing myself for new years, .. but this year I am not drinking to keep my personal judgment safe.

My SO seems to be really enjoying me not smoking. Sometimes I think my SO forgets I ever smoked.

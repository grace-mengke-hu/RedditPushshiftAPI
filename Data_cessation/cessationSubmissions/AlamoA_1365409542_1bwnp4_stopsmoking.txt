Pregnant and cold turkey

A week ago I found out I'm pregnant, and quit a >10 year pack-a-day habit then and there.  
I've tried a number of times before, but have always relapsed within a week. This time, it's a strange feeling. The psychological aspect is so easy - there is no way in hell I will relapse ever so little. Quitting is all about willpower, and I guess I've always had in my head the "plan B relapse" prior to this.  
The physiological aspect however... I've had no idea where the pregnancy symptoms ends and the abstinence starts! Irritability, head aches, constipation, dizziness... did I mention irritability?  
A week in, I think most of the abstinence symptoms should be gone (?), but as I still have them due to hormones, I fear that this will feel like a 9 month long I-just-quit-yesterday-and-feel-like-shit. Psychologically, I totally connect the symptoms to have the simple cure of a cigarette.  Will my only "crazy craving" be that of a cigarette? I certainly hope not.
  
Anyone here have any experience with this or words of encouragement and wisdom?

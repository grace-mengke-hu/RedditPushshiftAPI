Fresh air breaks... good idea?

At work I used to nip outside for a smoke maybe 20 times during the course of the day (I’m not micromanaged!).  Now 12 days nicotine free I still feel the desire to go outside. Am I reinforcing this association with nicotine if I go outside or helping to break it? I’d be interested to hear what people think

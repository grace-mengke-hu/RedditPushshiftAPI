No More - Day 4

Hey folks, new here and making this little post in a bid to stay more accountable re: my efforts to quit smoking. 

I've never been a "heavy" smoker (not that this is a habit worth splitting hairs over); the most I ever smoked was typically about a half-pack a day in times of exceeding stress or boredom, though for most of the past couple years I've kept it to 1-3 cigarettes a day. 

This is a habit I've been avoiding dealing with for a while (I've tried quitting probably 40 or more times in the past 7 months, not exaggerating, so I am feeling a tad superstitious about even discussing any of this, with anyone). I've often rationalized my cigarette habit as some provider of sanity in my effort to stay sober - though, in recent months, I've soiled this whole argument by breaking my sobriety numerous times, in numerous ways, and so I've begun to rethink whether the cigarettes are really helping me to stay sober in the first place. 

The chief problem cigarettes cause for me is sleep deprivation. I used to think this was an isolated problem, but I've begun to see a ripple effect that this seems to be having on the rest of my life; I've begun to wonder what lies on the other side of being bound by this behavior that I no longer enjoy. 

I'm on my 5th night without a cigarette and I'm hoping to make this the one that sticks. I miss that instant gratification that comes after the first few drags, but I definitely don't miss losing sleep over it.

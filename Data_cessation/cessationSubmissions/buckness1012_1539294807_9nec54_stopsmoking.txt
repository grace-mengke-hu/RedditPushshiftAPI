2 years. The one thing I did different that worked.

Not sure what my flair says, but I just hit 2 years without a single smoke.

The one thing I did different compared to the other 3000 attempts:

I didn’t tell anyone.

People started to comment on me not smoking after a couple weeks, and even then I downplayed it. Your brain rewards you when people congratulate you on trying to quit. Delay that reward as long as you can. You will find that gratification internally once you know that you’ve really quit. 

Many guides I’ve read say to tell people so that they can hold you accountable. That might work for some, but for me it didn’t. 

Hopefully this little tidbit can help someone as much as it helps me. Life is beautiful without cigs!!

Goodbye vaping, hello /r/stopsmoking!

I was a chain vaper for at least 4 years of my life and there is no doubt that vaping is much better than smoking cigarettes, but I recently understood that freedom is the greatest feeling when you get rid of nicotine from your body.  Today I say goodbye to my nicotine addiction and start my life as a free man, not craving for anything. I had a lot of attempts in the past but that’s my last one. Don’t wish me luck because I already feel great with my decision. Have a nice, nicotine free day, guys!

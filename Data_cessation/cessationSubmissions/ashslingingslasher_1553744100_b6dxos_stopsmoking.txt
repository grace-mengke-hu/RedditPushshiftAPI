Did I really even quit?

Decided to stop smoking almost a week ago and try out the Juul I got. I haven’t had a cigarette since, but I’m clearly still a nicotine addict. Is this even worth celebrating? I feel like I should be proud of myself for giving up cigarettes, but it feels like a cheap accomplishment. It feels like I’m cheating. There’s a box of nicotine patches on my nightstand that I’ve been staring at. Is anyone else in a similar spot?

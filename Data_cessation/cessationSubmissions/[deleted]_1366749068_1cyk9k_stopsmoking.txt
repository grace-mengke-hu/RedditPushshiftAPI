It's... tomorrow!

So I gave up for eight years, quitting on the day after we buried my dad, who died of cancer. Then I started again a few years ago, like a fooool. But I can go on no longer, so have chosen April 25, the anniversary of my father's death, as the date to quit again.

I know you will all be with me - here we go!

EDIT - I am such a colossal mung bean. Got my dates mixed up, and the symbolic 25th was a whole 24 hours further away. So I gave up a day early, on the 24th, ha ha.

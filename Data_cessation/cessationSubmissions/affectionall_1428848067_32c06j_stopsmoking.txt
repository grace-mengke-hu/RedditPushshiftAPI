I managed 100+ days a year ago (after 15 years) ...

I smoke(d) 1,5 pack a day and have done so for 15 years (aside from the 100 days last year). ANYONE CAN QUIT ... I've proven it already.

I started again out of boredom ... yes boredom ... smoking gives met 5 minutes/hour to drop whatever I'm doing and just have a smoke.

I actually felt better and LESS stressed when I wasn't smoking so I've got something to look out for but still ... my mind is trying to convince me I need this shit.

Crossed 2 months on Friday! Made it through my first night out post-quit with smokers!

Last smoke was January 31, so on March 31, I went out to the bar with a bunch of friends who are smokers. Enjoyed my lozenges while they were smoking! Even went outside with them sometimes for the fresh air. Had zero desire to smoke! Love seeing all the motivating stories here, they sure keep me going and keep the cravings down! Keep going everyone!!

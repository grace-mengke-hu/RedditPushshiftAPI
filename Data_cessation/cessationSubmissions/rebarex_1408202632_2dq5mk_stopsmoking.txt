Is anyone here dating a smoker?

Hi everyone! I've been an on and off smoker for about five years now (24/f). I have this strong urge lately to quit for good, so fingers crossed. I'm on day 2.

Anyway. Not only do most of my friends smoke, but my boyfriend smokes.  A lot. He's supportive of me quitting, which is great. He has no interest in quitting himself but I accept that, because I don't try and be preachy and convert all smokers to join me. It's hard to be with him sometimes because we used to share a cigarette together a lot. In  the morning with coffee, after a meal, after sex... etc. 

I usually do OK when he goes outside for a cigarette without me.. but I'm thinking of trying to set some boundaries -- like maybe asking him not to smoke in the car when I'm with him. Is that fair?

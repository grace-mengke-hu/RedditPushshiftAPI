If I had done everything I did yesterday _except_ smoke

I stayed up until 2:45am last night, mostly nervous about quitting.

If I had done literally all the things I did yesterday _except for smoking_ I would have been asleep by 12:45, 12:30... maybe even 12:15.

All of those cigarettes added up to OVER TWO HOURS. Holy moly! 

Anyway, the point is it's 11:45 tonight and I'm already in bed. If I hadn't have quit earlier, I would haved at least six more cigarettes, meaning it'd be 12:15 or later before I got to bed...

I'm happy to be a non smoker :) there was nothing to fear except fear itself

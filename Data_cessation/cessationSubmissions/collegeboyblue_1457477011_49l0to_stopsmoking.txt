First day.

Im a 19 year old college student working in a bar in my town. I undergo alot of stress and for the past year about a pack a day has been my coping method and i'm tired of it. I just threw away a full pack and came looking for a support system like this, as most of my friends smoke. Any encouragement is appreciated!

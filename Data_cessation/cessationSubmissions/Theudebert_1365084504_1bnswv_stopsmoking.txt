I'm a failure

Made it five days, then gave in last night after I got into a fight with the girlfriend while drinking.  I've decided I'm going back on wellbutrin.  I feel like shit for all kinds of reasons right now . . . 

Edit:  I want to say that I'm tired of this.  I'm tired of drinking and hurting my girlfriend and fucking up and smoking.  I'm tired of waking up hung over and unable to do my work.

I really want to say that, but I've said it a hundred times before, and I know that saying it isn't going to make any difference.  I've been trying to change my habits for the past two fucking months but nothing ever fucking changes.  I wish I could crawl into a hole and die of self-loathing.

I quit by accident!

Hey guys! I’m new to this sub. I’m a 25 year old female, and have been smoking since I was 17. I averaged 4-8 cigarettes a day, but on the weekends or on long drives it would sometimes be a pack a day. I basically only smoke when I drive or when I’m with friends- for some reason, smoking while sitting still outside or standing up has always made me lightheaded. 

7 days ago (Thursday the 17th) I got back from an exhausting trip. So exhausting, in fact, that I decided not to leave the house for a few days and just camp out in my bed watching movies. Even better, I didn’t have to be back at work until Monday! Anyways, Sunday came around and I had to run an errand. As I was going through my normal routine of grabbing my purse, keys, and cigarettes to walk out the door, I realized I hadn’t smoked one since Thursday afternoon on the drive home from my trip. I also realized I hadn’t missed it or even thought about needing a cigarette at all during that time. So I decided to stick with it, asked my boyfriend (also a long time smoker) to quit with me, and now I am 7 days from my last cigarette and he is 4!

I feel great. I have been wanting to quit for a long time now, because I would like to get in shape but could barely walk up stairs without getting winded. I was also developing a slight cough and my skin was always broken out. I’m 25, I should not have skin like a teenager!

I haven’t had any serious cravings. I got a disposable e-cig just in case, but I haven’t really had to use it. I did have a pretty killer headache last night and have had a sore throat for the past few days, and today my nose is runny as hell and I can’t stop sneezing. Probably the quitters flu, but maybe just a cold. But all that is no big deal considering I’m going to feel so much healthier in the long run! Maybe things will get worse, but for now I’m doing awesome!

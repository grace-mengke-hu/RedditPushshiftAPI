Why do I feel nicotine gum much more than vaping?

I’ve almost cut cigarettes completely out of my life. Started vaping. Salts have been the best thing to get rid of the cravings. Now I’ve tried nicotine gum on and off and have actually always enjoyed it. Actually enjoy the taste and after a few chews can definitely feel the nicotine.

Question is:

Why does 4mg gum (heck even 2mg) feel so much more satisfying than 35mg Nic salt?

Vaping provides the oral/smoke sensation but I’m always left wanting more... I can go through a mL in one hour, whereas one piece of gum I’m good for several hours...

Anyone else experience this? Any thoughts?

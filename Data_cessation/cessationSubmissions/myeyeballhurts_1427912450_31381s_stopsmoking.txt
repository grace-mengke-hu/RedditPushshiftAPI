Quit smoking 2 days ago, had a dull stomach ache ever since. Is that normal?

Well I had 1 cigarette yesterday (only 2 the day before), been a full now 30 hours now with out and I have just had a weird, indigestion feeling in my stomach. Is that normal? I am also quitting my long term addiction to diet soda cold turkey (been 3 days with out), that might have something to do with it too. 

I really am not craving, the soda seems to be bothering me the most, I have been drinking a TON of water. Just wondering if anyone else has experienced that and if so how long did it last?

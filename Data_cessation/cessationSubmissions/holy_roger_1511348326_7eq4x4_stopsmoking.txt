To the fighters.....

You are fighting a marvel of engineering....the modern cigarette.....perhaps the most efficient drug delivery system ever designed. 

So be it 6 hours or 24 hours or 48 hours, a week or a month........you are fighting and you are winning. 

Imagine your power....you are resisting a temptation which has been perfected over decades of research involving billions of dollars....

You are great....you are amazing....just keep going......

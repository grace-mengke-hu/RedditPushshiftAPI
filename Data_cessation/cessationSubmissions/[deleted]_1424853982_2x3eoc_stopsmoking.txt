I need advice on how to convince a girl to stop "social smoking"

I'm (18) currently dating a girl(20) who I'm crazy about but I recently discovered she's a social smoker. She says she "never even smokes a full one" but I really want her to stop. My family has a long history of smoking related deaths and I can't stand it. I'm worried that if we're not close enough yet if I tell her to stop that I'll look like an asshole. We've only been out on daytime dates but I'll be going out with her and her friends soon. I just don't want to come off as a controlling prick who tries to tell others how to live their lives. Thanks in advance.

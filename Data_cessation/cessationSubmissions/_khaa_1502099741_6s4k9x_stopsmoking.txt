I came across this wonderful free PDF about nicotine addiction. It really helps to understand what is really happening to you when you are a nicotine addict. 
The only way apparently is to quit cold turkey because nicotine does not forgive if you use other products as chewing gums or vaporizers, patches etc.. You cannot treat the addiction to nicotine with more nicotine! 
 Hope it helps someone!

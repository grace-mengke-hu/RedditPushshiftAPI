50 Days...

Seriously, who the fuck am I now? I always saw myself getting to 30 days and possibly an extra week, but 50 days? I use to come on here and see some of you with 40+ days on your badges and be envious. I would think "man these guys and gals got their shit together" and now I'm one of those people I would admire! Who am I now? I love it and feel so confused. I mean, I feel like I don't even know who I am. I'm proud of myself and can actually say that and mean it. It's a powerful experience. For ll those struggling: 

Come on guys if I can do it so can you.

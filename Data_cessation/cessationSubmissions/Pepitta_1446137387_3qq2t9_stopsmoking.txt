46 day nonsmoking.Unexpected urge to cry appeared. Help! Please help me ;(((((

I am really confused. I have been nonsmoker from 12.09.I started a new job a week ago and every day I have this urge to cry. It is auful! I cannot cry at my workplace. I want to grow and learn. How can I avoid this? the whole day today I was thinking about one single cigarette, knowing that it will help me. I didnt smoke, but I am staying at home now, writing this, crying lIke a child. I just cannot stop the tears! I want to hide somewhere. And i feel so inferior and stupid. I dont know what is going on with my emotions. Am I going crazy? I have no single reason to feel that way.

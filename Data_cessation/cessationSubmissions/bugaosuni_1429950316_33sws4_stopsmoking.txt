Cold turkey gets a bad rap.

Like it's supposed to be harder to quit ingesting poison suddenly.  "No, let's keep taking the poison, only do it less and less frequently".

It seems obvious in retrospect but quitting cold turkey is the easiest and best way to quit.  Yeah, there are withdrawals.... from an addictive substance that your body doesn't need or want.  But it's surprisingly easy to get past them; this sub will reinforce that daily.  And once you do get past that point things are just so much better.  So make the plunge.  Don't smoke today and then don't smoke tomorrow.  It's really not that hard and if you are honest with yourself you will realize that you don't want to anyway.

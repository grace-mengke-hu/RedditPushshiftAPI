The best christmas present

Hey Guys, First post on this sub-Reddit. 

Here's a little backstory first. I started smoking when I was 19, it was very casual and only when I drank. Like most peoples starting smoking stories though I started doing it more and more, then I got hooked. After an incredibly bad break up I just didn't care anymore and started smoking all the time. Maybe a pack every 2 days (I smoked and still smoke Pall Mall XL's, so theyre a little bigger) Fast forward to now, I'm well over the break up, happy with where I am heading and my life ahead of me, but the one thing I can't seem to shake is smoking. My dad is aware of it, even though I keep it away from the house and try my best to wash up and keep it away from him. I'm an adult, he knows that and as such we kind of just avoid the subject. What I wanna do is surprise him with the news that I have quit smoking by Christmas (I'm writing this Nov. 27 at around 10 am) which may or may not be possible. I believe I can do it but I came here to ask anyone for tips and tricks on how to quit within a month! If you have conquered quitting please help me. Thanks for all your help guys! Happy quitting!

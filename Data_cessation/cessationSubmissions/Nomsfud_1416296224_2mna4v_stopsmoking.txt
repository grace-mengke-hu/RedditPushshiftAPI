50 Days

I hit fifty days smoke free today. My last cigarette was September 28th at 10AM, and I can honestly say that I don't miss it at all. I rarely even think about smoking anymore, and when I smell cigarettes being smoked I end up feeling queezy and have to leave the area. 

As someone who, on his quit date, didn't want to quit I am very proud of myself. I look back now and wonder why I held onto those cancer sticks for so long.

Just for fun, here's my QuitNow! page. [Enjoy!]( http://i.imgur.com/TKEc5Vd.jpg)

I slipped up :(

I was doing so good... I was on day 18 or 19. One of my friends was in town and our thing used to be siting by the river and smoke cigarettes while we talked about everything. When she got here I couldn't resist and she bought a pack for us to share, which I figured no big deal, we're sharing it, and it's not mine, I'll just stop again after that night. 

Now I actually bought a pack for myself because it made me want them again, even though I was over cravings and the smell of other people smoking was gross. I feel like I'm back at step one all because of one night :( Here's to starting over new I guess. 

For everyone wanting that one cigarettes late at night, DON'T DO IT!!! IT'S NOT WORTH IT!!!

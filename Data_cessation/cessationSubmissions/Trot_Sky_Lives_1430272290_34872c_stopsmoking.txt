Wife reminded me that I should not smoke

My wife asked if I had smoked recently (I don't smoke when she's around). She was pissed when I said yes. Something along the lines of not being alive to see my grandkids.  She asked me to not smoke the rest of the year. I smoked the next day. I go through a pack a week. So I'm conflicted. On one hand, I'd like to live longer, on the other hand, well, nicotine.

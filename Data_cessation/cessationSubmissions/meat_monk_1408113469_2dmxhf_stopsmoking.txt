"How hard could it be?"

Last week I finally decided to stop smoking, and I didnt have any idea how painful it would be. I couldn't even make a clean start. At monday and tuesday I smoked one or two and even then I felt disorientated

Wednesday and thursday went fully clean but easier since I gave my pack away. Anxiety was reaching sky high.

Now on friday I finally relapsed, even then I felt like shit. I guess 2 and half days is a start

I have been doing NoFap and Pornfree without any problem, but a three days without smoking... 

I feel like cant do this alone.

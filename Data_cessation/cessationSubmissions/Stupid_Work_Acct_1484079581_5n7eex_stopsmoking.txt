365 days and IIIIIIIIIIIIIII'm just chekin in on ya!*

I honestly am shocked I made it to a year.  I smoked a pack a day for the last 20ish years and I loved(hated) it.  

I was a lurker here for months before quitting.  Just seeing story headlines pop up on my feed reminded me.  Made me think about my habit.  Eventually it helped me face it.

Now I'm a year in and WOW, it's like living a different life.  I think back to those first few days/weeks and all the self doubt/mind games/fuckery that I went through.  I asked myself many a time if it was really worth it.  It's so worth it.

Thank you everyone here who posted their stories, feeling, or happenings relating to quitting.  I couldn't have done it without this sub.

**apologies to Bill Burr for borrowing his intro.*

Day 5 - Gum / Patches; taper down and when to quit nicotine replacement?

I'll start with a little background, 29 years old, starting smoking at 15. One of those "worked in the service industry and started smoking on breaks" stories. I haven't had a single puff in 5 days, prior to which I was smoking around 1.5 packs a day for the better part of a decade, only smoking occasionally prior to that.


I'm feeling pretty dang good about day 5, and have cravings that I'm able to deal with, but I've been getting nicotine via patches and gum. I'm trying to limit it and cut back slowly, but I have the strongest strength patches and gum available. Should I buy some lower dosage ones or just stop the patches and do smaller pieces of gum maybe?

I hate using both but it's gotta be better than smoking. My craving/urges to smoke seem to be behavioral and habit responsive as much as physically wanting nicotine, (ie smoking with coffee, after eating, while driving, etc). 

I'm almost considering just ditching the gum and patches at a friends house and cold turkying this thing but maybe I'm better off tapering down on the nicotine replacement meds.

Sorry this is poorly worded and all over the place, I'm kind of in a rush but I wanted to reach out to this sub and say hello, figure it's another good way to hold myself accountable among all the other stuff I've tried so far in this first truly legitimate quit attempt (not saying I'm gonna fail, I'm really optimistic)

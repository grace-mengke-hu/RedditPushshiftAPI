When does the energy come back...?

Hi guys and gals,

Quit 4.5 weeks ago and it's been great. I never thought I would make it to this point and I'm hoping I can keep it going (this sub is a huuuuuuge help, seriously big thanks to each and every one of you). 

HOWEVER, I noticed that I'M STILL SO FUCKING TIRED throughout the day. Just fatigue and mental cloudiness. The continued insomnia at night doesn't help either. I thought these symptoms would start to diminish by now, but that doesn't seem to be the case at all. Has anyone else here had a similar experience?

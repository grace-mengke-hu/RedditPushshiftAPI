I have not made this far before. I have tried to quit twice in my life. First it was for 5 days and second time it was for 9. This time i am going strong and trust me i wake up sweating because i dream of relapsing. Is it common? I will really be disgusted with myself if i relapse. Loving this new life but fear is always there. Craving has gone but temptation is still there. 
I was 8 years smoker i am 26 now. 20 cig a day. Any suggestions?? Thanks for the support.

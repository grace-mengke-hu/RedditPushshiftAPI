Easy Way driving me a little nuts... any other books/audiobooks you'd recommend?

I started my 5th time reading Easy Way (actually finished 4 times) and I'm starting feel that he is bit to flipant with the realities of withdrawal.  Also feel like his constant belittling of smokers makes me beat myself more.  I'm already incredibly hard on myself and constant claim of it being easy is just patronizing.

Maybe I just need something a little more dry? Something a little more clinical?  Something that helps me embrace the logic and be realistic about the work ahead?

Any suggestions? Preferably an audiobook that I can listen to while at work.

Thanks

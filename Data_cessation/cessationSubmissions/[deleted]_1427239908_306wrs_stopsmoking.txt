Day 4: Your Bartender is plotting to kill you.

It's the worst job ever for this and I feel like I should get fired. I punched a Keno machine, I punched the cooler, I stomped all the boxes in to the ground as violently as i could, I threw a bunch of trays, and probably pissed off most of my customers. I was the biggest smart ass today. Any tips for not raging at work? I'm fine when I'm at my home. =(

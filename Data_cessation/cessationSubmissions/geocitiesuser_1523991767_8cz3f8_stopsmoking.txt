Day 9. Feels good man.

The physical withdrawal symptoms are all gone. I have very little urge to smoke if at all. Barring any unneccessary stress, I believe I am fully "quit" for the long term again. 

I feel like a mission has been accomplished. It's funny how ~2ish weeks of suffering prevents us all from quitting, but once you get to the other side it feels pretty nice.

I still haven't even finished cleaning up all the ash. But I will this weekend. 

Sleep still is iffy. Still kinda more depressed and volitale than normal, but really nothing major.

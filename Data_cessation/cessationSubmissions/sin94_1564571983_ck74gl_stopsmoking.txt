Thank you (joined the two-year club)

Cannot belive I made it this far. One year back I was posted victory [celebrating 1 year](https://old.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/93fe6w/thanks_to_this_sub_i_am_one_year_free/). This could be a cliche but being a Redditor for 10 years, this is the only sub that has a made the most significant influence and impactful in my life. 

Thank you, very much for your support.

Let's do it

I just finished smoking cigarette. And after throwing it away, I threw away all tobacco I had.. I know I gonna miss it, and I know I gonna whine alot here.. Today I felt just too guilty when I told my friend I wont light up a cigarette when we go for a cup of coffee. I hope next time I won't. Now get ready for my updates on how things go :D

HELP ME PLEASE :(

Hey
Can't sleep tonight.
Staying at exes because I'm basically homeless.
My Dad called to talk about life insurance so that when he's dead I can have his remortgaged house.
He also wants to take the fam for a vacation - last time we did that everyone fought the whole time...it was terrible.
While that phone call was happenning the guy I started seeing a while back was also texting me - he's having emotional problems and it's becoming apparent he's probably not over his ex and I'm now worriedâ€‹ I might be his rebound but I really like him.
So now I feel alone hurt and frustrated.
There's a corner store two blocks away where they sell smokes.
I am trying to not go but I really want to...but don't at the same time.
I basically wish someone would enable me and say "hey its ok if you have a smoke right now you deserve it" and absolve me of guilt
I don't know if I'm going to or not, I'm trying really hard not to but I'm a mess right now.
Don't know how else to deal with this pain though.

ðŸ˜¢ fuck

I just realised how fucked it is reading this that my dad is busy taking out insurance for 300 per mo and talking about a family vacation and ignoring the fact that I might not have a place to stay tomorrow. 
Argh!!!

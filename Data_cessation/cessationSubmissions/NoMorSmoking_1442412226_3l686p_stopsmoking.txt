Need Help to Stop Smoking, But My Wife Won't Quit

Ok so long story short I'm trying to stop smoking before I turn 30, little over a month. I have cut back severely, I don't smoke during the day and don't buy cigarettes at all. But my wife smokes, she has tried to quit and has gone a few days hear and there but can't get it. She quit when she was pregnant just fine. Now I have the will power to not smoke during the day, not buy cigarettes, but when I come home from work and I want one they are right there in her purse and she shows no signs of quitting right now. Advice? Suggestions? I know I can do it, but having them in the house makes it so much harder

Sore dry throat and mucus after not smoking for 8 days phenomenon

It's my 8th day without smoke today but something strange is happening. My throat feels like I have been out in the pub drinking and smoking all night long and I only had a pint of beer 3 days ago and one today and those were out in the open without any one smoking near by. I have noticed this dry mucus throat phenomenon starting 2 days ago and never thought much of it but today I am even huskyer and hope that it will go away soon.  
Has anyone had a similar experience?

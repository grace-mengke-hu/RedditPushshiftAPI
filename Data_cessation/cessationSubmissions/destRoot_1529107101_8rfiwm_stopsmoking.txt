Never thought this could happen so quickly..

I've been a smoker for 5 years. I would have never thought that quitting would be so easy. I usually smoked while I study or during school sessions. It was my "time off" moments in between the sessions. The first two days were horrible, the urges were there and I would often have dreams of smoking. I decided to read scholarly articles related to smoke cessation distributions and found that the highest probability of quitting was when using a patch with a gum/mint. A couple of days ago, I got off the patch since I completed by full steps. I would have never thought that quitting would be so simple. Everything feels wonderful, and I've been a lot more energetic and focused in school. Also being able to jog continuously for longer durations as the days go by felt remarkable. I was astonished at what "new" smells I could distinguish. One of my most memorable and motivational reason was watching my friends who smoke in school. Whenever one would turn around their head to speak to me, I would instantly feel nautious because of the horrid smell of their breathing from the cigarettes they smoked. I respect them very much, but secretly I feel relieved I am no longer bounded by this effect. Also! I was able to smell the smoke that stuck to my clothes, which surprised me in a way. I had already known of all this. However, I did not know the degree of this smell was so distinctive. I know I haven't reached a time like some of you guys, but this subreddit really helps me and reading your stories was a prime motivation for my cessation. 2 weeks, 3 days down, a life time to go.

First step forward.

Long time smoker. Started back in College and continued on for the past 7 years. 

I've tried to quit in the past and the farthest I've got was at least 1.5 months of not smoking. 

Now I hate the concept of smoking cigarettes. I hate the taste, smell, and just that overall feeling that I get from smoking.  Granted it feels amazing on a stressful day but still the cons outweigh the pros.

So I decided that last night I was going to take my last one. Finished that one and threw a pack with at least 15 left into the outside dumpster with the lighter(hopefully nothing catches on fire). 

I know my weakness in which makes me crave for one. I want to avoid that but work, school, and other things in life makes it much more difficult in which I'm going to try to organize and be better about. 

Although I know that I will be super pumped with the money, health, and just overall benefits of not smoking in the future, but I also know it don't come easy.

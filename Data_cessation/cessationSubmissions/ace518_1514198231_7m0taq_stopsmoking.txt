My quit day was Nov 18th, here's how I did it

I quit smoking over a month ago.  I've been lurking on this sub for years and had several failed attempts over those years.  This is the longest quit I've been in the last 17 years.  Here's how I managed to do it.

I had been cutting back for weeks.  I have been supplementing/replacing cigarettes with a vape, for a long time.  None of that seemed to get me there.  Well, I made it 2 days without a cigarette in mid November, and realized that Nov. 18th was my 6 month birthday.  My birthday is May 18th.  The point was it was a date I was able to remember.  It was around Nov 20th when I decided to make this one stick.  So I looked forward at my next big date coming up.  

Dec. 4th was my 6 years sober from alcohol date, and every year I post something on that day.  It always gets a ton of likes, and it's vain, but it helps.  I decided, I'm gonna make it to the 4th, and when I posted for my alcohol quit date, I'd post that I had quit smoking as well.  So I got there and looked forward to my next date.

Dec. 18th was 30 days from quitting.  That was my next short term goal.  Once I got there, I realized, I'm looking for Jan 1st next.  Then Jan 18th (2 months quit).  At that point I'm assuming I can just goal set month by mont.  

Make it a day, then 2, then a week, then a month.  Put dates on the calendar with how many days it WILL be! Don't just count the days you've quit, look forward to how many til you hit a goal.  Thats how I did it.  I promise, it gets easier as you go.  Thank you to everyone that posts here and inspired me to quit.  Hopefully this helps someone else.

TL;DR - Short term goals, one day at a time

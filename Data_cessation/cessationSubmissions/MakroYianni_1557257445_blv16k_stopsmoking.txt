How to stay accountable?

How do you guys keep yourselves accountable? 

This is like my 20th attempt to quit and I’m so sick of failing. Ideally my wife would be my accountability partner but she’s not ready to quit and I obviously can’t make her. 

What do y’all recommend I do to keep myself honest?

My last cigarette last night

I've been smoking since I was about 15, so roughly 14 years. Wow. Nearly half of my life I've been a smoker. It's fluctuated between a pack a week, to a pack every 2 or 3 days, everywhere in between, and back to a pack a week now in the present. I quit for about 2 months a few years back but relapsed. I can sometimes go 2 or 3 days without a cigarette and it doesn't usually bother me, but alcohol is a trigger. 

Last night I smoked the last cigarette in my pack, and I told myself I'd give quitting another real shot. The most recent time I tried to quit I lasted about 6 days (almost a week!), but found myself chasing down alcohol to justify smoking: if I'm drinking then I almost HAVE to smoke, so I went out looking for booze. 

What can I do this time to make it past the 1 week mark? The 2 week mark? I haven't gone longer than a week without smoking in nearly 3 years. That's scary.

PS my badge says 261 days - that was from the last time I really gave quitting a shot and lasted 6 days. I'll update it when I make it through today. 

Thanks guys I really appreciate this community. It inspired me to try quitting last time.

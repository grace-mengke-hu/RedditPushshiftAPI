Trying to quit for the second time

Hi all, this is my first post here (though I’ve been lurking for a couple of days)


I decided to try and quit again. Long story short, I quit smoking cigarettes back in around about October 2017. I switched to vaping and eventually quit that altogether too.


Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago and I’m currently staying with my partner and his family (We’re in a long distance relationship) and I hadn’t touched a cigarette since I quit. Problem is, his family are smokers, so the cravings became really strong and I gave in and bought a pack. A few days later I came clean to my partner about it knowing he’d be (understandably) disappointed. But he handled it well, said everyone makes mistakes, and we came to an agreement that I could smoke until his parents come back from their mini-break (3 days in the Netherlands) then I gotta pack it in for good. I agreed and promised that I would. 


On the day they return I kept my word and gave what was left of my pack to my partners older brother &amp; that was that. 


I haven’t gave in again yet but the cravings are becoming stronger and stronger and I don’t know how best to deal with them without resorting to vaping/other products, but I know that if I go onto anything else I’ll crave the real thing again so I’m kinda just going cold turkey. Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated!

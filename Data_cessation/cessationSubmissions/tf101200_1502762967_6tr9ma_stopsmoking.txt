Quitting for the nth time. Any and all advice/tips please!

Hey guys, this is actually my first post on reddit. I've been lurking in this sub for some time through the few times I've tried to quit recently. I'm making some really big changes in my job and life and want to abolish smoking alongside of these. I'm going cold turkey and methods that you guys have used that seemed to help would be greatly appreciated!

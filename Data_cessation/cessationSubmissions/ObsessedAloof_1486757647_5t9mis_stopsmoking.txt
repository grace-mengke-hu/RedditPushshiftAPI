Embarrassed, but want to go again.

Yesterday I posted about quitting halfway through the day, and I got some great suggestions and encouragement. Well unfortunately after work I was immediately, almost on autopilot, buying a pack and smoking. Not only did it feel horrible and disappointing to myself, but I was also heavily embarrassed. I had made the mistake (?) of making some big post on Facebook about how I was quitting, and a ton of people liked it, including the guy I have a crush on who I know hates smoking. I'm not doing it for him, but still it was a positive.

So now I'm starting the day over. I don't feel very good, but I want to give up again. I have no expectations of what will happen, I just don't want the pain of smoking anymore. So, day one again I guess. And no Facebook posts until I'm firmly established in this lol.

9 months: Nicotine-free Baby delievered

Exactly 9 months ago Will's sperm conceived with Power's egg to form the fetus of cessation.  Today, a beautiful nicotine-free Baby was delivered.

I went cold turkey 9 months ago today (NO nicotine products at all = gum, patch or vape). Having a sense of humor helps!  Not going to lie, I still get cravings. 

However, today is much, much better to handle than it was during my tender first 5 weeks.  Hang in there. 

Remember, the next puff is only in your mind. Be good.

I almost slipped up ):

So yesterday my ex texted me and things did not go well. After that train wreck I went and bought a pack. I grabbed one out and was this close to lighting it up. Then I really thought hard about it, I took that cigarette out of my mouth and ripped it in two. I ripped up the whole pack and threw them all away. Man these first few days are hard as hell, I could use some motivation guys.

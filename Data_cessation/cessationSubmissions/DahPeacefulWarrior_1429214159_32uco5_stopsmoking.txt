It's been 105 days and I feel good, Advice request

The thing is I never thought I was a hardcore smoker. I started at 15, Im now 22. I didnt chain smoke. I managed to try and quit for 1 month at the best effort. I used to smoke every weekend and from time to time when stressed during mid-terms.  Yet I wouldnt go a week without a cigarrete. 

This community has helped me, reading the stories and just knowing people could do it helped me a lot in the mental strategie.

Now I see how good life is without nicotine. I feel more clean on the inside and as if I have a celarer mind now. The thing is I just cant let go of the anxiety on the hands. Everytime I get stressed I find my finger in my mouth as if Im trying to smoke, Any tips on that?

Thank you.

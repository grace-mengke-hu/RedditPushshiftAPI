Can't stop clinching my teeth and it's driving me crazy

As the title says, since I quit smoking I have noticed I'm clinching my teeth a lot. They're hurting. This is both awake and asleep. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.

Other than that I'm really not craving so much these days, and I'm loving being a non-smoker so far, besides my teeth hurting. For anyone just starting out, you can do this.

Acknowledging my limitations (24 hrs in)

So, I'm a weak-willed worm.  I admit that.  Been smoking for about 20 years or so.  Tried to quite MANY times over that period.  Always cold turkey, and never made it much further than 24-48 hours before breaking.  This time, I decided to face the fact that my will isn't strong enough to do it alone.

I got the patch.  Yeah, I know NRT isn't the best way to go, but I needed to omit smoking NOW - I've got a half marathon to run in May and I will NOT train for it while smoking again.  I know myself well enough to know that I'll blow it cold turkey, so I'll wean - never tried it before..  Who knows?  Maybe a crutch is exactly what I need.

So far?  24 hours in and it has been EASY.  I mean, yeah, I still get my fix, but I've hardly even THOUGHT about it.  That's gotta mean something.  If I can wean myself enough to break the habitual times (waking up, after eating, playing FIFA, etc), then maybe THIS time it'll stick when I start decreasing the patch usage.

Just realized I have to reset my badge...  :/

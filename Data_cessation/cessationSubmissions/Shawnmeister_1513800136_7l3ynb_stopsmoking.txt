Bro-ing You Out on Day 478

Today, I was cheering a friend through quitting and it reminded me how hard things got at some point or another during my initial 3 months. This sub especially helped a ton. Reading through what others were going through and relating to it was the reinforcement I needed when the cravings kicked in. Soo~ this post is gonna sum up what I've written in my quit journal from day 1 to month 6 (last entry because smoking no longer was my routine at that point and having my morning coffee did not equate to cigarettes nor having that smokey islay at the end of the day equate to a pre-bed smoke)

&gt; Quit Tool : Champix

&gt; Context : Entire family smokes. Office is a family business. Only 3 out of many friends smokes

**Day 1**

&gt; The nausea sucks. The dreams were horrid. Cravings after every meal and everything felt weirdly off. Very angry and irritable. The only plus side that made it worth not quitting quitting was my mother saying if I make it, she'll quit too.

**Day 2**

&gt; Pretty much day 1 on steroids. Family dinner at a steakhouse that night and alcohol was involved. I was rather depressed this entire day everytime I'm not angry or irritable. 

**Day 3**

&gt; Day 2 on steroids. Cravings were off the charts but I gained new confidence. This confidence is the same one I have today where I know I can do whatever I want and I can resist it.

**Day 4**

&gt; Went drinking with a bunch of smoking friends. They didn't know I was quitting. Pulled through rather easily. Had cravings but it was nothing major. Champix however, isn't fun. Dreams were unbelievably vivid when mixed with alcohol.

**Week 1**

&gt; It's easier. Cravings still strong

**Week 3** 

&gt; Sense of smell and taste were back in full force. Went for a food blind taste and totally nailed it. Went for the same blind test months prior and flopped hard. Reinforced quitting.

**Week 4**

&gt; Could finally run 10 laps in the pool without needing to rest at the end of each lap. Greater reinforcement but the cravings peaked here. Each craving was intense (no shaking or anything but the urge) but lasted no longer than 5 seconds. 

**Month 2**

&gt; Still on Champix. Dreams are horrid, stomach wasn't all too happy, still couldn't have a morning coffee, still craving but easily shrugged off. A simple meh in my head was enough.

**Month 3**

&gt; This right here is the magic month. This is where things ended up being ridiculously easy. This was also the month I threw Champix aside. Woke up feeling absolutely amazing every day since (shitty life events aside)

**Month 4**

&gt; This was where I got extremely cocky. One night out with the boys for whisky and cigar (I'm not an avid cigar person) and that night I didn't feel like having even 1. I did however wanted to see if a dose of nicotine would pull me back so I had two puffs and passed it right back to a friend after. Turns out, it did have an effect on me still and since then, I've not wanted for another. I also didn't enjoy the smell on my clothes, the taste in the morning and the stale smoke in nose sensation. I've always liked cigar notes better than cigarettes and knowing how I didn't like it then, sealed the deal. (The nicotine, I liked thus a lesson in cockiness and not underestimating it)

**Month 5**

Smoking is starting to no longer be routine. Cravings were far in between. Doesn't need to be shrugged off anymore.

**Month 6**

&gt; Not smoking is now a routine. Everything normalized and I no longer craved for a smoke after or before any thing I do that used to call for a smoke. This is also where I stopped writing due to it no longer feeling foreign or special. Craves still do happen but they don't last longer than a second even at their best.

**Today**

* I now despise the smell of freshly lit cigarettes.
* I no longer want for a smoke
* Cravings can be weeks apart and doesn't even take a second to get rid of.
* Life is so much better without smoking. More so than I thought it would be.
* Nothing so far has caused me to reach for a smoke (and I've gotten some pretty shitty days)
* My room no longer smells like a bar!
* My car now smells of leather and not tobacco
* My office is a better environment for my staffers
* I no longer have to go out in the sweltering heat in the middle of a hot day

Will I smoke again? Nope. Don't care for it.

**TLDR**: It gets easier. So much easier in fact, you'll wonder why you were struggling when you initially quit and why it took you so long to quit. Whatever you're going through right now isn't permanent.

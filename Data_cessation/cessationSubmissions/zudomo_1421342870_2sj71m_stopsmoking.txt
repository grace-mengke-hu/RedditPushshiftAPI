Can't believe it's been 26 days :)

Hello Everyone,

I can't believe i've gone 26 days without smoking. I remember the early days, where I would think about smoking for somewhere around 6 hours a day. Now it's about 30 minutes (Both times collectively).

Also it took 2 hours after waking up to think about a cigarrette today. Usually it was the very first thought.

These were the three things that helped me the most:

1. Positive Affirmation
2. Water
3. Stalking this sub (I spent hours a day here)

Good Luck Everyone!

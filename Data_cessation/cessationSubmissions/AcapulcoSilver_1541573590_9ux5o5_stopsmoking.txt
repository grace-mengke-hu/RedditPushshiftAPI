I can smell and taste like never before!

Today I was shopping at the same grocery store ive been going to for years when the smells from the bakery stopped me dead in my tracks. Delicious sweet aroma of freshly baked breads and buns filled my nose. I have been smoking cigarettes heavily for 12 years now, and five days ago made the life-changing choice to stop smoking. I have always been able to smell and taste, but WOW i did not expect the intensity of my taste buds and nose to skyrocket! Small victory but i honestly teared up..  what else in life have i been missing out on because of smoking? 
Just had to share :)

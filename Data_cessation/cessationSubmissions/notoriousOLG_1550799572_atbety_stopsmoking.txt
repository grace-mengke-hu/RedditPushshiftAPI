Trouble disassociating smoking from my daily life.

I’ve been smoking for 5 years and I’ve reached the point in my life where I want to quit before it gets more difficult. Problem is, I associate so many things that I do in my daily life with smoking and I can’t even envision doing these things without a cigarette in my hand. I don’t know how to break this association. 

I can’t imagine driving during my daily commutes without smoking. I can’t imagine taking a nice walk somewhere without constantly chain smoking. I can’t imagine getting through studying for university without taking smoke breaks to soothe my stress. I can’t imagine going for lunch during work without having a cigarette as relief. I want to quit so badly but when I think of doing these things without smoking I start to panic and lose all motivation for quitting. Obviously I can’t stop doing all these things, so how can I disassociate smoking from them? How can I survive my daily life without wanting a freaking cigarette? :(

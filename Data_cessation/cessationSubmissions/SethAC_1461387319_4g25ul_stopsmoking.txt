~50 days!

I'm visiting my sister-in-law and nephew, and want a cigarette SO bad. My brother is currently deployed, so he's not here. But every time I walk past the front porch, I see the two chairs and flower pot that has an ash tray in it. It reminds me of when me and my brother used to sit there at night smoking cigarettes and talking. I haven't truly missed smoking until coming to to their house. 

What do you do in that situation? I know that's not the only way to spend time with my brother, but it's he memory of us doing it. It was our thing. 

Regardless, I won't stop. But it just hits me right in the feels :'(

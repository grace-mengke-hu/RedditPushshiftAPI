Today's day 8. Still getting harsh cravings, but fewer. Yay me. 

I'm also sleeping way to much - going to bed about 11:30 and sleeping until 10 or 11 in the morning. This is not good, considering I'm used to getting up at 6 o'clock! In your experience, how long did this cessation-related sleep disturbance cycle last?

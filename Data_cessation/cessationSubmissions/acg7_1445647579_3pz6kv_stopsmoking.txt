36 Hours in and Struggling... Vape thoughts?

I'm 36 hours into quitting, and it has been really tough. I am convinced I want to quit, it is just so tough because I have always really enjoyed cigarettes. I'm considering getting an E-cig, but I really don't want to just replace one habit with another. I know vaping supposedly isn't nearly as harmful as smoking, but I still don't want to be Vaping from here on out either. I have tried vaping before, and I don't enjoy it nearly as much as a cigarette, but I do believe it will help a bit. My question is for individuals here that have quit by starting vaping -- did you find that it was easier to stop vaping than it was to stop smoking? I don't mind vaping for the short term if it helps to wean me off nicotine, and helps with the physical smoking motion, but I don't want to just replace smoking with vaping indefinitely.

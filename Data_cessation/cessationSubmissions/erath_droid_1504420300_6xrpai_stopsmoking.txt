One week today.

Well, in 32 minutes it will be exactly one week since I lit up my last cigarette.

Quit at midnight with half a pack left. First day was rough, second day was harder, third was actually not that bad.

After a number of attempts (of various success) I'm pretty sure this is the one that will last.

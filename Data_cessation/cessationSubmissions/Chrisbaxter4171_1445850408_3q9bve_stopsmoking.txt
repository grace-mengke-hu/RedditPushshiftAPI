Asthma almost gone

I started smoking at 13 and now at 44 I've been smoke free for 14 days and feel amazing!  Now I was puffing 30 fags a day and using an asthma pump 6 times a day..
Well now I use it maybe once every other day. I go to bed earlier and for the first time in 20 years sleep well wake up fresh. I'm no longer tried in the day no longer get head ache's and feel so alive. Just two weeks ago even a short walk I felt weak and got what can only be described as a stab in the back. Lately a can walk a brisk mile and feel amazing other than muscle pain lol. So glad I stopped and can start living again.

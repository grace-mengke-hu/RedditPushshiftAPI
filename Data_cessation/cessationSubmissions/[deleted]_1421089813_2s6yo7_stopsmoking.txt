"Closet smoker" - no support for quitting. Advice?

I posted earlier today too, sorry if I'm posting too much. 

Anyways, I quit smoking on Friday after 10 years of smoking.

My boyfriend does not know I smoked. Before you scoff, we are in a longish-distance relationship and only see each other ~1x a week if we're lucky. 

I am becoming moody with my quit and he has noticed. I can't just come out and say "Oh I quit smoking, I might be crabby for a while". 

I also don't want to feel like this awful person hiding a big secret (which is part of why I quit in the first place).

Advice? I don't want to tell him because he's very disgusted by smoking and cigarettes and he literally had no clue I was a smoker. I NEVER ever smoked the day before I would see him or the day of. 

It's also just hard to feel like I don't have anyone to talk to about my quit.

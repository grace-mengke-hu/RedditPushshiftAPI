Second time quitting.

I have a half a tin of tobacco sitting in my bedroom right now. I'm not even tempted to smoke it. 
I went out with a guy who suggested I do this because you feel stronger for having the smokes in front of you and not smoking them which kinda pumps you up.
Can't say it's making me feel pumped or anything but I am not tempted.
I am getting cravings at around 4 or 5 o clock though for some reason then they go away.
This is my second attempt at smoking. I started to quit on the 23rd of December. I had a sneaky smoke on Christmas night. I couldn't drink for Christmas as I was on antibiotics for a chest infection (which was the reason I quit in the first place) so I had a ciggie.
Besides from my smoke on the 25th I haven't touched my tobacco.

The first time I quit, I quit because I was ill.  I decided I would only smoke when I was drinking and that went okay for 9 months. I even managed to wean myself of smoking when drinking but got bored at course I had to do so decided to take up smoking again.

This time though I don't plan to smoke when I drink. Again I am going cold turkey. I am eating more but I am eating a normal amount of food, while smoking before would suppress my appetite. 

I was smoking for 11 years. I can smell smoke everywhere though and I remember when trying to quit before I could even taste smoke in my airways. 

Not looking forward to that again but think that my smoking days are done this time.

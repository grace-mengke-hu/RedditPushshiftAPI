Made it through one week cold turkey!

And actually, it wasn't that bad. Physically it was shit - I've been a sweaty, coughing, snotty, shivery, dizzy, insomnia-ridden mess - but mentally it's been easy! I think I was finally, after 14 years of smoking 20-a-day, fully ready to stop. My oldest child is really happy and says I smell of 'nice shampoo' now :) And my youngest is much more cuddly with me, probably because I don't stink! Here's to freedom and good health.....and, for me personally, saving Â£3,099 a year!!!!

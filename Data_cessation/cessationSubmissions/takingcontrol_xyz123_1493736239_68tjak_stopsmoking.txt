Whenever you feel the urge to smoke, do this 10 second routine

Just close your eyes, empty your lungs, and take a deep breath. 

Repeat 4-5 times until the urge to smoke passes. It has worked for me every time since I quit. 

Although I never felt that I was going to lapse during the time, it helps shift my focus and get rid of the urge instantly. I'm not taking any risks. 

I hope this helps others out! It's helping me :)

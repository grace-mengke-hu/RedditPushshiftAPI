1 Month and 1 Week

I was at a wedding with a lot of smokers yesterday (french and spanish people) and i'm super proud or the fact i was able to resist smoking !
I feel very good, free, zen, happy tonight. Good luck to all of us it's really worth quitting :) more energy, better self esteem, more sensations, better relationships, empowerment...!

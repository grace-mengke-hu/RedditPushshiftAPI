I started again and I hate myself.

I was 30 days clean cold turkey. 

I just finished reading "the easy way" and everything felt like it made sense. 
It's always gone like this, I get past the month mark and suddenly forget how shitty I felt when I was a pack a day smoker. 

I hate myself. I feel dirty and my pride has taken a huge hit.

Does anyone else have any advice for staying on track? I keep telling myself to stop being such a little bitch and just leave them behind, but something always seems to trigger it. Stress, drinking, I can't seem to avoid it and I feel like shit.

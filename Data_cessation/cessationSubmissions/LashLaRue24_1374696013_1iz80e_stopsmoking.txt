Third time's a charm, right?

So, I quit for 22 days, then went back on for about 15 days. After that, I was off of cigs for 55 days, then back on for about 50 days. This is my third attempt, and I want it to be my last. I know the quitting process fairly well right now, and I know it really isn't that hard; it just takes the will power. I'm about to write up my note card containing all my reasons not to smoke and alternatives for smoking when I get a big craving. Let's do this.

PSA: I would also like to make this statement: If you are 50 days without a cigarette, and somehow end up smoking one while drunk, that is not defeat, that is a slip-up. Yes, it is preferable to have no slip-ups, but letting one mistake slide is a lot better than sliding back into addiction.

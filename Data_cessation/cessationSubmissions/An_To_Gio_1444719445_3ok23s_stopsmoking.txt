Rain on someone else's parade

Got out of the post office, saw an untouched cig on the pavement, my junkie brain flared up, but - **plot twist** - I stomped that little fuc**r to pieces.
Two birds with one stone: I didn't smoke and I prevented everybody else from doing so, without any form of self-righteousness or obnoxiousness.

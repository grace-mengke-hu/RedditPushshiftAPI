41 days smokefree

I haven't smoked for 41 days now, wasn't easy but I'm getting there. Today I realised for the first time I couldn't remember how many days ago it was that I smoked my last cigarette! It's no longer on my mind constantly any more!

I haven't smoked about 82 packs, that's 1,600+ cigarettes and where I live this is about 200 euros!

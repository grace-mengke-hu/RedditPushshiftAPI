I feel like my mind is coming down around me!

Ten days in and though I have felt some of the positive health benfits, I am now feeling the effects of less nicotine... or something. I find it hard to concentrate at work, I'm finding my thoughts drift a lot easier than normal and I could swear I've cought myself doing things that I don't even remember doing. It's not super serious, but it's getting me thinking about picking up a cigarette and restoring the balance I had. I really don't want to... I've made it this far and I don't want to stop and I hope this comes to an end soon cause THIS... this is making it harder

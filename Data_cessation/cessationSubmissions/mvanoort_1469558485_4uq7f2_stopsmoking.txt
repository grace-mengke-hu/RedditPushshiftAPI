Found a full pack of cigarettes; what should I do with it?

I was out for a bike ride yesterday, which is awesome - did 35km, which I probably wouldn't have been able to do if not for 5 days of not smoking. About an hour from home, I looked on the trail in front of me and there was a full pack of cigarettes, still wrapped in plastic. I picked them up. I didn't have a lighter with me, or I might have smoked one right away (I'm still feeling the cravings pretty badly from time to time). I brought them home, and honestly didn't think about them until today, when I considered having one. I really don't think it's a good idea to open the pack 'cause I'll probably end up smoking them all. But it also feel wrong to throw away a perfectly good pack of smokes. What should I do?

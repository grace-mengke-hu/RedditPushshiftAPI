How do you stay quit?

I just went through a bad breakup, and started smoking, quit, started again and am now quit.

&amp;#x200B;

Several times in my life I have quit, sometimes for a few years, many months and so on and so forth. I am always battling smoking addiction.

&amp;#x200B;

For me drinking triggers the cravings, and I find them hard to resist. I thought maybe I should quit drinking too, but it is hard due to social pressures...

&amp;#x200B;

Any tips, tricks or suggestions to stay quit this time?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks friends.

Hypnosis...

Hey reddit, 

IN short, I did not believe in hypnosis and tried it anyway. 

&amp;#x200B;

IT WORKED!

I used Andrew Dobson's stop smoking tape. (((I got it from a friend, but I think you can get a copy of it somewhere on the internet. I do not think it is on youtube. )))

&amp;#x200B;

If you're on the fence, try it. I never stayed awake through it even once. It started working after one 30 minute session. I went from smoking WAYYY to much---&gt;&gt; to smoking none. Good luck

I'm happy to answer any questions. Peace

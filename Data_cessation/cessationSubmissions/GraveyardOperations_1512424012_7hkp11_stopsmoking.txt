Well, guess it's go time.

I'm done.

This bullshit habit is a money sink and has caused more problems than the brief relief each drag brings.

My sinuses are on overdrive near constantly.

They stain my teeth.

They make me smell like an ashtray.

And, eventually, they'll ruin my face and body.

So, I have one last pack of cigarettes I bought before work. I know some of you may be shouting "JUST THROW THEM AWAY NOW", but I just want a Bon Voyage with a habit I started 7 years ago. Luckily, from what I've heard, 7 years isn't that long to be a smoker, so it might be easier to quit.

Oh God, the buzz in my head is going crazy right now thinking I'll never have one again, but I have a plan!

At work, on break, I'll just play games on my phone

At home, I'm a video game nerd, so I'll either go for a jog when it gets really bad, run in the shower, clean up the house, or do just about anything to keep my mind occupied.

I have a game plan. I have a support network. Now I just need to find the will. I've gone a week without smoking in the past and the cravings dwindled. They're just imagined from a habit, anyway. I can replace that habit with something healthier.

I'm not going to end up like my aunt with emphysema. I can do this. The only thing that'll irk me are those self-righteous non smokers that I'll inevitably end up joining... Well, except the self-righteous part.

Real talk, I hate smoking, but self-righteous non-smokers are even worse than cancer sticks. LOL.

I hope I can do it.

A few tips for those quitting smoking

Here's a list of things that may (or may not) help you quit.

1) Switch to herbal - caffeine absorption rates once nicotine is out of your system triple, meaning that morning coffee is going to feel like a doubleshot espresso on top of your withdrawl anxiety. Avoid, get a range of herbal tea's and enjoy.

2) Get something to play with your hands, rubik's cube, stress ball  (some of you can brag these for free off your employer), wrist strength trainer.. etc.

3) Avoid stressful situations, stressful people. Its soo much easier when you aren't surrounded by triggers.

4) If you do give in, one cigarette won't set you back. Anymore and you should reset the clock.

5) Don't expect withdrawls to go at once, they creep up on you and when you get complacent they are quick to remind you that they are still there.

6) Don't drink alcohol, even if you don't normally drink and smoke at the same time. Every time I have a beer I reach for a cigarette.

7) Blow off steam, video games and films are great. Comedies are essential to remind you that you have a sense of humour, especially if you are feeling stern.

8) Sleep more, relax more, remember it will pass.

9) Don't worry about weight gain. Your better off 8 pounds heavier than smoking.

10) Try not to obsess over everything - this was golden for me because when you quit you can become super obsessed about literally everything. Try to put your focus on relaxing (seems impossible but with meditation, comfort music, baths with candles) you can manage.

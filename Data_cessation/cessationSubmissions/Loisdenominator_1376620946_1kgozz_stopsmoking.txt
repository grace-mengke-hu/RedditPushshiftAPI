54 days in, first challenging night

I stepped out of my routine tonight and went out for a drink after work tonight with a colleague. He's a smoker but I had told him I'd stopped and he didn't smoke at all the whole time we were at the pub, which ended up being close to 4 hours (!)

Anyhow, I've had a few drinks before during these 54 days so it's not the alcohol trigger but more the being out on a nice night with a good friend shooting the shit trigger. I've been having a relatively good quit so far, as evidenced by my posts to date, but tonight was a real test. I only had a couple of pints!

Talk of cigs never came up, but it has been in the back of my mind all night. I could've and would've very easily stopped to get some or even bummed one. I didn't of course. I guess I just wanted to acknowlege the fact thatI've had my first real challenge. While I didn't cave, I'm still actively clenching and grinding my teeth?

How do you deal with these moments of weakness? I know there will surely be others. And while my brain is telling me not to smoke... Grrrrrrr!

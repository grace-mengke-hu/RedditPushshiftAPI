2 weeks baby. This is a breeze!

It was a rough first week. Now I barely even think about it. I feel so different this is amazing!

I'm not bursting with energy or anything but I dont feel anywhere near as tired as I used to after a long day at work.
I have barely used my car all week, walking seems a whole lot easier!!
Eating more for sure... Healthy food too. Everything Tastes so much better.
No more coffee either, drinking tea every day and feelin better for it.

Feels like a major life change is happening right now and I couldn't have done it without the support of all the people who contribute to this sub. Thank you all.

For those of you considering quitting. Absolutely do it. Your life will change before you know it!

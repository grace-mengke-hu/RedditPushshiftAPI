18 Weeks and going strong

Just said I'd pop in and say hello! I quit Tobacco on the first week of February with the intention of using a Vape. Used it for 3 days and came down with a nasty infection (Mix of chest infection and influenza!) which helped turn me off smoking either Tobacco or the Vape! Also worth noting in the 18 weeks I've gone from 130lbs (9st 4lbs) to 148lbs (10st 8lbs) as of this morning. My next step is figure out what I want to take up in order to get fit again and turn this excess weight back into muscle.

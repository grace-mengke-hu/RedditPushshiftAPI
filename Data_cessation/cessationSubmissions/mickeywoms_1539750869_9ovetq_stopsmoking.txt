8 Days... very tempted

Hi guys! My SmokeFree App recommended I check this out and hear about other people’s experiences quitting. I’ve been smoking for 3 years and while I’ve had no problem going a week without a cigarette (I’m a college student and often take a break on holidays when I’m with my parents), I think it was always easier knowing I would be able to go back to it any time. I’ve really been having trouble with the mindset of never being able to smoke again. 

Since a lot of my friends still smoke, it’s hard to avoid the temptation. Today, I caught a whiff of someone’s cigarette and actually yelped out loud. In NYC (where I live) everyone smokes, so it’s hard to avoid. 
How do you guys handle temptation and constantly being reminded of what you can’t have? Any tips?

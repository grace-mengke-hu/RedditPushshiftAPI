Slipped up

I’d gone 43 days without a cigarette and then today I made a stupid error at work (nurse) and of course first thing I did was buy a pack. I only smoked 2 and threw the rest of the pack away, but I feel so so shitty. I had gotten so good at managing my anxiety and then bam I’m back at square one. Anyways. Thanks for listening. Love this sub!

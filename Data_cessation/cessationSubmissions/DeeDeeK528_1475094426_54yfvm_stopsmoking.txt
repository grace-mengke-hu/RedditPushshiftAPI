Quitting and depression

I just can't stand myself when I try to quit! I am on day 4 and even with the patch I am not doing well. I don't really want to keep smoking, but I would like to return to my happy self. Last time I tried a few months ago, I thought the negative emotions would go away but even after a month they lingered and I was anti-social (hard with a husband and 4 kids). Zyban had a negative effect on me, so that is out of the question. I've put a call in for a mild anti-depressant to get me through. I saw many on this sub comment that smoking masks depression, so I am hoping this helps. Comments or suggestions welcome.

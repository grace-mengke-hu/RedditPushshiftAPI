I've tried to quit a million times but this time I'm going to make it

I've been smoking for almost a decade and have tried quitting several times over the past six years or so. I've always tried to quit for someone else or when my heart wasn't really in it. Yesterday I decided it's finally time. I only smoked six cigarettes yesterday and only one today.

My goal is to make that cigarette I had this morning my last one. I've been using an electric cigarette a little bit but what I've found most helpful is chewing/sucking on a cinnamon stick pretty much at all times.

I just wanted to make this post to make me stick with this. I can do it. We can all do it.

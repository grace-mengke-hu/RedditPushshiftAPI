After 4 days

I had my last cig last friday night, before that I was smoking around half a pack a day. Or atleast that's what I'm telling myself, since I would roll my own and never count them. 

Last Saturday, my frist day, I told my mother that I'm quitting and her reaction was "you won't last even a day, don't be ridiculous". This motivated me even more.

My parents are avid smokers who buy their own tobacco, somewhat huge amounts like a few kilos a month. If I want a cig I just need to leave my room and I'll get as many as I want. 

The worst day so far it was Day 3, yesterday. I had a weird wet dream about my ex. A wet dream in which I was smoking. Woke up horny, confused and with a huge desire to smoke (and call my ex). I had to stay for 2 hours in bed, rolling around, to be sure I'll not go in the living room and get a cig. 

However, the benefits are already starting to show. I'm eating much more than I usually do. I'm a skinny little thing, so every little kilo counts. 

I. CAN.FUCKING.BREATHE. 

I can exercise more easily and my clothes don't smell like I'm working in a factory anymore. 

The only downside is the constant coughing and sore throat, I didn't experienced that while smoking. I hope it will go away soon.

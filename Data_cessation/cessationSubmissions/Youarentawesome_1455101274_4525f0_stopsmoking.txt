Smoke free since morning

Last smoke i had was today morning when i woke, then i decided to quit, just like that(Cold turkey). Been more than 5 hours, i have  the craziest craving to smoke one. But i am hanging in there. The problem is I'm at work and this tension/stress doubles the craving. Anything i can do to reduce it? I'm drinking fuck load of water though.

Edit1: Completed Day 1. http://imgur.com/FhcGFkL. If someone has asked me 3 days before if i could do this task. I'd have said get the fuck outta my office. I don't know why, fighting today morning's craving wasn't that hard. I Hope it's the same throughout the day.  

Edit2: if anyone's still interested, I made through the 2nd day but the actual test begins now because tomorrow is weekend and it tough to be bored and not smoke. Imma fight this shit.

I don't need this anymore!

After trying to quit a few times this year, I decided that it has to work out this time if I put enough motivatin and discipline in it. My friends engouraged me to quit and they are supporting me. Stopped two days ago and my throat feels dry and hurts sometimes. I'll go to a concert tonight, hope it will not be too hard to resist. 

Do you have made any expierience with quit cigarettes but still smoking weed occasionally? We usually mix it with tobacco, so I think that could be a problem...

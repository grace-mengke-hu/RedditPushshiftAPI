120 days and I'm still here.

Things have not been going well for me.  My life basically sucks.  I lost my job and broke up with my girlfriend.  Basically not smoking is my only reason to be happy.

I know smoking is not going to magically get me a new job or a new girlfriend.  It will limit my possibilities in both areas.

Anyway.  I suppose the moral of the story is:  Don't pretend like smoking is making your problems any better.

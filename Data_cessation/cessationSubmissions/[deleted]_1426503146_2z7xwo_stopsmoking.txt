NEED ADVICE

Right I have been a heavy smoker for the past 8 years, On average for the past 5 years I have smoked roughly 70 cigs a day without ever any notion of giving up. 2 days ago I made the decision to stop.

So far I have gone two days or to be specific 52 hours.

Reddit I feel fucking terrible, I feel as though I'm about to rip my damn eyes out of my sockets, my skin feels like its moving and I can't stop sweating. 

I know its cravings and I know I shouldn't cave in because honestly smoking is killing me but I don't know how long I can last feeling like this. 

How long do these cravings last, I need some general advice before I go batshit insane.

Cheers.

EDIT:

I thank everyone for their kind words and encouragement, However I must say this.


I broke folks, I bought a tobacco pouch this morning and sparked up, I am ashamed beyond belief at this as I was doing so well. The worst thing is that everything I was complaining about didn't go away. I'm sorry to everyone who tried to help me, I honestly feel like I have let you all down.

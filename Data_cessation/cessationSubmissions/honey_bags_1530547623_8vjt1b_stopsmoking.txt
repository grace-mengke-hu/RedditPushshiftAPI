On Day Four...

Hey Reddit, happy to be here! Probably my third or fourth time attempting to quit. I had a long, long weekend last weekend of partying, and was so down this past week that I said, "Fuck it, this is the last pack." Thursday, June 28, was my last morning cigarette, and long, it's been a long weekend to come through. But I made it through going to a brewery on Friday night without smoking! Being accountable to friends is really helping me, but I figured I could use a little extra accountability from internet strangers :D Let's do this!

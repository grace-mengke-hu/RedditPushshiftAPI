Seasoned Quitter can’t stay quit for long

Hi guys! Glad I found this community. I’ve been a pack a day smoker for over a decade. I’ve quit soooooo many times. The problem is staying quit. Once again, I’m approaching a month off cigs, and my head is saying “just one won’t hurt!”
I know it’s crazy and irrational, but it gets me every time. I always end up rationalizing and convincing myself. One leads to a pack. How do you guys deal with these kinds of thoughts?

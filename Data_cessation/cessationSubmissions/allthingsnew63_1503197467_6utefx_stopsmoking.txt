57 days smoke free / 10 of them nicotine free / 1st time really struggling

It wasn't easy like a walk in the meadow when I was on the patch, but it was easier than this.  I read the Allen Carr book after I quit with the patches and I drank the Koolaid.  I don't want to smoke and I'll make it through this day as well.  But I am having strong urges for the first time.  I am really struggling.  Can't stay asleep, getting depressed, over-eating in the sense that I recognize it's just to fill a void, and I'm either climbing the walls and can't concentrate or I'm lethargic.

My question is, is this happening because I have no nicotine at all?
Does this get better anytime soon?
I read that the bad stuff is over within 4 weeks.  Is that true?

If I can put a timeline on this, I think I can make it.  But if this doesn't get better soon, I don't know that I can.

I really don't want to smoke.  But I need to know this really will get better soon.

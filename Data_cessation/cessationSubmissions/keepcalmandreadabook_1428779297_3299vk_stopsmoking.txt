I don't understand why I still want cigarettes.

I've read the Allen Carr book and I understand that the nicotine is out of my body completely after 3 days, so why do I still crave cigarettes? I know he talks about the "mental addiction" too, but is that going to stick around forever?

As a writer I grew up idolizing famous writers and artists, and all of them in their pictures (mostly) are smoking. I feel like that's something I'm going to always identify with, and don't know how to get rid of it.

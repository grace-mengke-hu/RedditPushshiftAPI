Just threw my pack in the dumpster

Been trying to wean myself down a couple of cigarettes every week or so (had a deadline a few weeks back and found myself at a pack a day - and not liking it). Smoking the E-Cig more has most definitely helped, though I'm probably smoking it a lot more than I'm supposed to.

Weird thing is that this past week or so, cigarettes have started to taste strange to me. Down to about 3-5 a day and they give me no more throat hit. Mostly tastes like nauseating air and they've become less and less cathartic to smoke. Is this normal? The lack of throat hit, I mean? The E-Cig seems to be packing MORE of a punch whilst it's always been the other way around.

Just threw my last few cigarettes away. Hoping that I can get by just on the E-Cig from now on. Any tips? Or is it all right to smoke it constantly whilst dealing with the withdrawal?

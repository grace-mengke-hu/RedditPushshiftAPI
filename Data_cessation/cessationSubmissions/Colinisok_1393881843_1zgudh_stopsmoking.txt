Back to the first 24 Hours being Smoke Free. Thank you to everyone for being apart of this.

I'm going to message my fellow non smoker friends (the ones I've been personal with) and admit my defeat.

I smoked at least 12 cigarettes in the last 2 weeks not being true to my word of no longer smoking. I'm 20 and I was at a few parties where alcohol was apart of the social mix.

These are just excuses the truth was I didn't need smokes to make the party more enjoyable. I only smoked because the addict part of my brain was in more control then the Colin who wanted to smoke. The Colin who makes up temporary excuses was in Control, not the one who looks a life as a long journey and realizes the other side is only romanticizing something that doesn't need a romantic attitude.

Thanks for being here guys. My roommates don't really hold me accountable and my family smokes so they cheer me on but they're just good light support. I actually feel some guilt when I have to reset my badge rather than tell my smoking mom, hey I fucked up last weekend. I'm hoping to inspire her to quit.

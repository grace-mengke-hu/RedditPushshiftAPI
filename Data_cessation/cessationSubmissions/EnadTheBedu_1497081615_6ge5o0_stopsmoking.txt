[Question] Two weeks without cigarettes with the help of aid, but ...

I have quit cigarettes for about two weeks now with the help of nicorette. I'm very happy with myself for not smelling like an ashtray and enjoying tastes and smells around me. However, I'm a little worried as to if I don't have my nicotine aid that there would be a higher possibility to relapse.

To people who are in or used to be in the same situation as I am, what did you do? Any nicotine free replacements?

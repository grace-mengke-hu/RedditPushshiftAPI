Day 2,557. That is exactly 7 years ago that I stopped smoking!

It's getting too late at night, but I just wanted to post this here quick and tell everyone that it's completely possible to live your life without the addiction to cigarettes.

I was a pack-a-day smoker, and the prices kept going up. If my memory serves me correctly, I was paying $7 a pack, which obviously added up quickly. My brother told me about [a book by Allen Carr](https://www.amazon.com/Easy-Way-Stop-Smoking-Non-Smokers/dp/1402718616/), and I decided to buy it. The book turned out to be very helpful, and I actually put out my final cigarette before even finishing the last few chapters. I ended up reading the rest of the book a day or two later.

My final cigarette was in a parking lot of a laundry mat, and as I finally put it out, I actually felt really good about what I was doing and my future. The book does help, but when I had cravings, I turned to my old friend water. I drank a lot of water, and believe it or not, it helped me more than anything else.

Take walks, enjoy life, and free yourself from the grip of cigarettes! While the book *can* help you, remember that this choice is ultimately your decision.

3 weeks nicotine free!!!!

If I could humbly offer one bit of advice (besides Allen Carr); get out there and do all the things you love to do while smoking ASAP.  Do not empower cigarettes further by avoiding life.  Eat, drink and be merry.  Stand next to your smoking friends and family.  Don't avoid them because you are a non-smoker and they aren't.  The sooner you do these things, the sooner your brain will re-learn enjoying them without cigarettes, just as never-smokers do.  If I can do this, anyone can!

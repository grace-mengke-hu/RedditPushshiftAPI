Turns out...I don't know how to run. :P

I was going to start the C25K tomorrow, but after work I wasn't tired, so I thought no time like the present. Got ready and went. Yeah, I saw other people out there, there are the bouncers, the kickers, the lopers...I'm not sure what category I fit in since I've not done running in oh 25 years. I've done cycling and gone to the gym and done those machines, but straight running? Huh. I didn't think it would be confusing. The cool think was, I didn't get out of breath! I didn't get out of breath at all. Now I couldn't have run up to the end of the street 39 days ago. So funny looking or not...it's a win! I think I'm suppose to stretch now, but I don't know how to do that either. :) Bring on the shin splints! I just know I'm going to get them. I'm giving myself until my next birthday in December to get this shit down! FU cigarettes! I didn't cough or anything! :))

My wife is upset. Time to quit.

I'm 32, smoked off and on since I was 15. Been with my wife for 8 years. She knew I smoked when I met her. I've "quit" for 6-7 months multiple times, but always end up smoking again and keeping it secret, until eventually the guilt adds up and I tell her. Well, I quit last summer, went 7 months without smoking. Recently my buddy introduced me to his Juul, I bought one of my own, and have been hitting it hard. I told my wife last night, and quite simply, she's upset about it. At first I thought "I guess I'll need to switch back to keeping this secret." But this morning, even though I'm dying for it, I just couldn't being myself to hit that thing. I feel too guilty. I love my wife tenfold more than I like smoking, but she doesn't understand what addiction feels like, and doesn't know how hard it is to quit. Is horrible guilt a legitimate motivation to quit? Anyone experience something similar or can share a story?

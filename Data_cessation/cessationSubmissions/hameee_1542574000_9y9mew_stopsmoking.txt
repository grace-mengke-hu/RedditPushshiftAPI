I relapsed after 9 months

I'm so pissed off with myself. I was super stressed about my relationship yesterday, and literally, the only thing which I thought would help was smoking a cigarette. Now i'm 12 into a 20 pack. I'm planning on stopping again after I finish this pack. Wish me luck. This time I have to do it on my own, without weed or my girlfriend (who's in America) to help me!

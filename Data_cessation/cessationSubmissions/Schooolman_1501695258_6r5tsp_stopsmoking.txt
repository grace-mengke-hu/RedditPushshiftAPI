First post - 17 days in and using Chantix. What I'm doing and also a question for other Chantix users.

I started smoking when I was 15 and am feeling really positive about this run at quitting. I'm now 30 years old and I decided I really wanted this to be the year I made some positive life changes. Have been going to the gym 4 times a week for almost 8 months now, not hanging around some toxic people, and generally eating better. Overall I'm feeling great.

This is definitely not the first time that I've quit smoking, and I've used all of the different methods. Cold turkey, patches, gum, and Chantix once before. The Chantix was the only time that I stayed off cigs for more than 3 months.

For the most part everything is going great, I'm feeling really positive about quitting, and even went on a camping trip with a bunch of smoker friends, and wasn't really tempted at all.

I've been using sunflower seeds in the car to stem that habit, some nice quality toothpicks for after meals, and jolly ranchers while I'm at work. Also I'm using one of those stop smoking apps to log time, and cravings, and I am really surprised by how much it is helping this time around!

My only thing is that I feel like all of the sudden this past couple of days I have become much more irritable and had a very hard time sleeping, due to the Chantix I'm sure, not aggressive but generally annoyed with everything. Has anyone else that has used Chantix had very minimal side effects and then out of nowhere, (I'm starting my 3rd week of the full dose) had more of the side effects come on later in the treatment?

I'm trying to plan out how much longer I want to stay on these pills, I plan to call my Dr tomorrow either way as I need a refill if I do plan on sticking with the Chantix.

Thanks for reading and any input, and good luck to all on their path.

**TLDR** Quitting is going great, I feel very positive about it. Getting some later onset side effects and wonder if others have had simiilar.

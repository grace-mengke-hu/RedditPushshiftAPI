Breaking this cycle.

I’ve had so many mornings waking up with a sore throat and telling myself I’m done smoking. I only smoke at night at the end of the day; half a pack between 8 - 10 PM before bed as my “unwind” time.  Nicely tucked away but completely controlling me, costing money, and harming my health. Also making me feel like a mindless puppet! I have stopped for a month before a few times but honestly the amount of cigs per day steadily increased and it’s beyond time to be DONE. I am done.  Ready to be free.  One cig left - flushing it. Removing ashtray.   

I know calling a quit right at the beginning is easy, but I love this sub and I believe there’s power in declaring my intention and commitment. So please share your stories and successes - anyone else have a certain time and place they smoked? How did you change the habit?

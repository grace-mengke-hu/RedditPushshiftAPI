7 years, down the drain.

7 years of not being able to cough constantly after laughing.

7 years of not being able to have constant anxiety about my next cigarette.

7 years of not being able to toss and turn all night from being loaded up with nicotine.

7 years of being forced to have lower blood pressure and a lower chance of stroke and heart attack.

7 years of not getting to spend tons of my money on cigarettes.

7 years of ... wait a minute, all of that stuff sounds pretty great now that I think about it.

7 years of ... freedom, relief, and peace from being rid of that horrible fucking drug. 

You can do it too, don't give up! &lt;3

A week today.

My grandmother has lung cancer from smoking. Every time I picked up another smoke since her diagnosis I thought of her til I couldn't do it anymore.  

It's been hard. Last night we visited friends and they were all sitting indoors smoking and I just vaped a little. I really wanted to break but I didn't.  

I know I can do it this time. I don't want to smoke a cigarette ever again. I don't want to die that way. I don't want to be out of breath every time I climb the stairs, or play with the dog, or walk to college.  

One week down. It can only get better from here!

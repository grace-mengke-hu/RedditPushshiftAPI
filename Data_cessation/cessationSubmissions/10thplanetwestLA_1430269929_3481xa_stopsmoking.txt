Fingers Crossed: I have tried to quit many times, but I think this is finally it!

I am 33 years old.  

I started smoking casually when I was 16 years old, but by age 18, I was smoking around 8-13 cigarettes a day.  For 15 years, I know there were days (and sometimes weeks) that I didn't smoke, but these were rare occurrences.  

In my early 20's, I was surrounded by smokers, but as the years went by, most of them quit.  I think most of them were just social smokers and were just smoking through their college years.  Whatever the reason might have been, a vast majority of them became non-smokers by their mid-20s.  I had times that I was sure I 'quit' as well, but a few days or a couple weeks later, I found myself rationalizing buying another pack and I was back to smoking again.  

I more or less have the same groups of friends as I did back then, but with one huge difference:  While we used to all go out and smoke together, I found myself only going outside with the few left that smoked or even just by myself. 

Recently, something weird has begun to occur.  Some of my buddies that I haven't seen smoke a cigarette in almost 10 years have started smoking again.  It started with them bumming cigarettes from me or something while we're out, and now some of them even have their own packs.  This was kind of a wake up call for me, so I decided last Sunday to just quit cold turkey.

This went extremely well for a few days without even so much as a craving.  However, something stressful occurred at work that Friday and I found myself buying another pack.  Guess what?  I smoke half a cigarette and I got extremely nauseous and threw up.  I threw the pack away and haven't had another craving yet.  I've even been around my smoking buddies and just turned down their offers to smoke with them.

There's no way of knowing if this will last, but at least for now, I have ZERO cravings.

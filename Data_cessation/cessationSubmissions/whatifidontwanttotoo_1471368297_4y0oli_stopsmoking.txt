Happy Birthday, Smoke-Free Life!

So I did it! It´s been a whole year since I smoked my last cigarette and I finally feel like this is going to work longtime. After smoking for more than 10 years daily (always rolling so I had no exact count) I struggled super long with cravings, especially habitual triggers like stress, alcohol or social events. But after about 6 month I finally stopped thinking about cigarettes almost every day and since then it´s a piece of cake. 

So keep at it, it´s totally worth the pain!

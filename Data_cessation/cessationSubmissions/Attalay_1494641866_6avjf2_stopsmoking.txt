Tug of war

Currently at 3 months, 24 days, 2 hours, 54 minutes and 11 seconds being smoke free.

I didn't think in the least that I'd still be struggling with cravings nearly as hard as I still am, even as I type this.

I read EASYWAY leading up to quitting, as it seemed to help a lot of people here. It helps occasionally. But regardless of what maybe the truth, it really does feel like a sacrifice more often than not. As backwards as it sounds, the newfound health I can feel in my lungs feels wrong. Almost like I'm supposed to feel shortness of breath, I shouldn't be able to take full intakes of air like this, I need to correct it, etc etc.


I don't know where I'm going with this, I just had to vent to people who understand.

Stay strong y'all. Tomorrow is another day.

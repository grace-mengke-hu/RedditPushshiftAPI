Allen Carr @ 7 Days: Observations

First off: the name of the book is "EasyWay" - not MagicWay, EffortlessWay, FallOffALogAndNotSmokeAnymoreWay, or SnapYourFingersAndTaDaWay. Quitting smoking, like ANYthing in life, is going to take some effort, and time.

On the scale of things I've done in my life, from 1 being "Easy" to 10 being "Difficult", on day seven I'd have to give it a 3/10 on average, with spikes of 7-8/10 but MOSTLY 2/10. I mean, the advantages gained compared to the "effort" expended to quit, it doesn't even scale correctly. Quitting is, *relatively*, EASY.

That being said, /r/stopsmoking was at first (and still is) a wonderful support place, and it's where I heard about Allen Carr and found great testimonials about the book. After I actually smoked my last smoke, I wanted to come in and give support and encouragement to others - to give back to a place that gave so much to me. And I have, and it's been great.

BUT. I see people actually bagging on Allen Carr. Fair enough, not everyone quits the same way. I see people having a real hard time, and relapsing, and everyone saying "its ok to relapse, we all have". The argument over e-cigs. My brain tells me to go have a relapse smoke just to, you know, legitimize the entire quit - *nobody* quits for good their first quit, right?! And that is now fucking with my brain, so I may have to take a breather (HA!) from /r/stopsmoking for a bit.

Thank you to everyone here for getting me to where I am. I feel better than I have in 23 years. It gets easier. And better. Now when my heart rate climbs, I feel interestingly good instead of generally shitty. The only "downside" to this whole thing is now I can smell how bad my kitchen smells and I can't seem to get the smell of onions out of the sink.

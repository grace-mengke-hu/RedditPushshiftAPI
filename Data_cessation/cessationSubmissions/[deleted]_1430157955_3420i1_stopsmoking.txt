5 days in, and the cravings, my god, the cravings.

I quit smoking jan 1st 2014. I did awesome for about 10 months, and fell off the wagon. Believed I could have just one. Well, here I am, almost 7 months later, struggling to get to that point again. I have quit and restarted so many times since my initial failure. I will quit, go a few days, a week, I think the longest was 12 days, but I always get stressed over something and smoke. 

Here I am, currently 5 days and 14 hours smoke free, and the cravings are awful. All I can do is eat. I even have pot to smoke, a crutch I lean on heavily when trying to quit cigs, and I don't even want to get high. I was supposed to go to the gym today, doing the stronglifts 5x5 program with a work buddy, don't feel like it.... Girlfriend came home from work and tried putting the moves on me, looking for some loving,  and I'm just not up to it. 

Basically I'm just feeling all around very shitty for some reason, all I want is to smoke, but I'm so SO ready to quit smoking. I used to run. I went from 310 lbs last year this time to currently about 230, as a 6ft 30 y/o male. I quit smoking last year and a month later quit drinking and a month after that started dieting and tracking calories and macros and a month after that I started running with the c25k program. I kept with it and beat c25k, then beat c210k. Then shortly after that all happened. I slipped up with the smoking. I want so badly to get back into my running, losing weight, feeling better, and just being happier, and this, is the biggest roadblock stopping me. I've quit again and again and again. This is it. I'm fucking done. I'm going to post this message... Go fuck my girlfriend... Get high as shit... And go hit the gym. Im going to restart c25k and do my lifts. 

Fuck cigarettes.

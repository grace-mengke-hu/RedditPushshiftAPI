Tell me your positive experiences! Especially your early ones... They feed me!

I am a whopping 61.2 hours into quitting and the small milestones I have reached (and noticed) since "quitting" are what keep me going. In my short time, I have noticed my blood pressure drop and the return of my sense of smell and taste. Please, keep me going!!!

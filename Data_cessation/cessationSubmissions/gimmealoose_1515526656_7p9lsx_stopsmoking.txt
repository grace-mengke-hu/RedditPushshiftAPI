Day 8 - Still going strong

Quit on NYE. On day 8 after smoking a pack a day for 12 years. Had some rough patches last week. Had a very hard time concentrating and was irritable most of the week. I didn’t buckle though, which I’m proud of. Even though it’s been rocky, I’m very happy I quit. It feels really good knowing I’ve kicked my worst habit. Definitely still get cravings several times a day, but they are more manageable each time. Plus, I have way more energy and am noticing small improvements in my health. 

Looking forward to feeling even better as my health, bank balance, and confidence improve. It is process, but I really feel quitting was a gift to myself. Right now I’m enjoying it and appreciating the benefits. Good luck to everyone else that is stopping. We’re all in together.

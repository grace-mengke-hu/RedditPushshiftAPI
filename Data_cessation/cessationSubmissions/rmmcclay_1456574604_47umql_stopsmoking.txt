Not a Cough in a Carload: The Tobacco Industry's Campaign to Hide the Hazards of Smoking

I was born in the 1950's and it was considered normal to smoke tobacco cigarettes.  This talk includes a wealth of the imagery that was so responsible for the massive waves of addiction that started in the 1930s. Even though I'm from the era of many of the commercials shown in the talk I find them so unbelievable.  I can only try to imagine how ridiculous they must seem to young folks today.  

[Aside: I remember these joke cigarettes in Tijuana, Mexico, they were Horseshit Cigarettes and their motto was: Not a Fart in a Carload.]

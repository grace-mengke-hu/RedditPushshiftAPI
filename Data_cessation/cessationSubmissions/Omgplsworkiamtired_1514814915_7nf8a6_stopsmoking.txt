Long car ride coming up. Advice needed

I have to drive into Atlanta tomorrow to get to one of the hospitals for an appointment. I live about 1.5-2 hours away from my destination and have to take the interstate to get there... 

I don't normally drive in 3-7 lanes of traffic and it drives me batty. I usually smoke a lot on these trips. It's getting easier but now I have to go to a different hospital so I also have the added bonus of not knowing where I am going.

I don't want to panic and stop and buy cigarettes. I already have a bag of jolly ranchers in the car and do well driving around town. I am 9 days quit, but my brain is still trying to trick me that I could just have one or just buy some for the drive etc... 

I am going to doctor appointments for a brain tumor (benign) which is a driving force behind me quitting. We are going to be discussing surgery vs. radiation. Which is stressful all by itself. 

I plan on having lemons and cinnamon sticks with me. The mouth burn helps keep away cravings.

Almost 1 week nicotine free

FUCK

I’m still having mad cravings of a cigarette. I want that buzz so bad, makes me all tingly when I see the word “buzz”. Mmmm fuck. 

I’m smoking a stupid vape pen with 0 nicotine juice. 
I wanted to start this journey cold turkey and I’m doing it that’s for sure. 

Everyone kept saying “oh the first 3 days are the hardest”. I think today is my hardest day. Fuck. Fuck.

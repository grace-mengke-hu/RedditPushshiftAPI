Almost 1 week

Hello everyone!
Wish luck, will and power to every person who wants to quit smoking!
3 year smoker.
These week, I am staying in my parents’ house, that is why I was able to quit smoking for almost 1 week.
However in 5 days, I am going back to the capital city, where I study. I am afraid that I can start smoking again once I leave my parents’ house.
Also, I have severe cravings in the evenings. Every evening I plan to go to the city to buy shisha and smoke it. But still I don’t think that it is a good idea.
Wish me luck and will!
I hope I will be able to quit this shit and be a healthy person.

Back to square 1

So i stopped smoking around november 25th (dont remember exact date) i thought id give it a try because i was going on a 7 day cruise december 1st and had just run out of cigs so i thought "im not gonna buy another pack, im done." thinking that being on the cruise would be a perfect time to distract me, keep me busy. and i made it. it was just about 2 weeks by the time i got home. and then it started. i got a terrible flu and was bed ridden for a few days, i know thats not from quitting but it was the last thing i needed. i layed in bed, feeling like shit, in an empty house with just my thoughts. and thats when i started to get really depressed. i was stressing out on things that didnt even matter, i had a zillion thoughts rushing through my head, and it wasnt fun. i was also becoming anxious and irritable. i woke up one morning and felt good enough to get out of bed, showered forced down like half an apple, and (this is almost 3 weeks in) got in the car and bought a pack of cigs. i relapsed. I was mad because the second i puffed that first square, a lot of the stress went away. i felt better (not physically because i still had the flu) but mentally i felt better. but. its december first and i found this helpful subreddit. So. im quitting again. I have about half a pack sittin in my car, my question to you is should i throw them away and go cold turkey? or i was thinking maybe have one tomorrow, then 1 day off, then 1 the next day, then 2 days off, then 3 days, then maybe a week? is Do you guys think thats a good idea or should i just rip em to shreds and never look back.

Honestly does it get easier?

So fucking upset right now. It's been 27 days and IT ISN'T FUCKING EASIER. I WANT A CIGARETTE. So fucking badly. Life is boring as fuck and cigarettes were the only thing I enjoyed. Really want to just say fuck it. Super depressed and so it's hard to convince myself that my health is worth it.

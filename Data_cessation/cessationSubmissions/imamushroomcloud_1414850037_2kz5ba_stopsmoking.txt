Can't get through a week

I've been "quitting" since Sunday the 19th. I finally decided to quit for ME, not because my family hates it or my boyfriends hate it. The trouble is, I can't get through a week yet without smoking on a Friday night when I go out with friends. I hang out with a ton of smokers, and I'm in college, it gets really hard to sit with my friends while they smoke, especially when I'm drinking, and not end up smoking myself. 

The thing is, I always feel terrible the next day, mentally and physically. The regret has faded enough by the next Friday that I forget about it and smoke again. Does anyone have any advice on how to get through the week to week struggle, or the social struggle of having smokers as friends?

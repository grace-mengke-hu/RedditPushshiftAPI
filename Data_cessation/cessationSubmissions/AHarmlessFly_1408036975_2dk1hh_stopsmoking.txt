My first Real Attempt

This is It, I am going to quit this time, I have never really Tried before because i wanted to, but this time I want it.  I find this Subreddit so motivational and helping, i will be coming back day in and day out for a while.  I always hear the first three days are the hardest, today is my first full day, stopped yesterday mid afternoon.  Almost been a full day. So Im excited about that.  Im just rambling sorry, I am feeling a little spaced out today, and hard to concentrate on my work.  I am sure i will feel better this weekend.  Looking forward to that! Thanks for all the encouragement everyone provides   :)

500 days smoke free [AMA]

500 days since I quit smoking. I have come a long way since the last time I smoked. I have posted here before with my progress pictures and this the latest one [500 Days progress](http://i.imgur.com/H40kkfk.jpg) . Sorry to brag, but I am very very proud of the accomplishment and hope it motivates others as well. Ask me anything regarding the last 500 days, I'll try and answer comprehensively.

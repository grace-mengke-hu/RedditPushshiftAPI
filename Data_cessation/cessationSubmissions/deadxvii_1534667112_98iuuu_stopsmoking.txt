Day 4 and trying to keep strong

This is the biggest challenge of my life been 20 years smoking every day but woke up today and the only thing on my mind is cigarettes. Trying to stay strong and resist as want to beat my addiction.  Any advice on how to take my mind of it? Been told by a friend should try a vape with no nicotine In as well as my patch and inhaler to trick my mind into thinking I’m having one. Or is that a bad idea as my quit 51 adviser says it’s not a good idea. 

Thanks in advance

I can't believe this :)

So, I have been smoking for 15 plus years, pack a day at the very least. I was too broke to smoke this weekend though. I've been pretty broke before but was always able to at least scrounge up a few bucks for a pouch of tobacco; this weekend, I couldn't even do that. Fortunately, for my own sanity, I have a TON of nicotine gum laying around from previous quit attempts and was able to get around my addiction that way.

Yesterday, back at work, I asked a co-worker for a cigarette and he gave me THREE! "We smokers gotta stick together," he said. I was eternally grateful, until I went outside to have that first smoke. It was DISGUSTING. And PAINFUL. And then I smoked the other two and...YUCK!!!! I stuck to the gum for the rest of the day.

This morning, I only had a brief, weak craving to smoke before it went away. I brought gum to work with me once again and didn't even bother asking for a smoke. When I got back to my nabe after work, I bought a single Newport at the local bodega and puffed it down and...I HATED IT. Every second. I have NEVER felt this way before, even when I smoked while sick. I think I have truly turned a corner, and this is very exciting. I think I will take a badge now :)

tl;dr I QUIT.

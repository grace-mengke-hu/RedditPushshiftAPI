What's the deal with Allen Carr?

I've posted on here before, but I don't get the deal with Allen Carr? It seems that, to some people, his book is the only way you can quit smoking. Or, if you are having a bad day you need to re-read the book. I've honestly never understood the point of me telling myself that smoking is bad for me. I know that smoking is bad for me, if you don't know that it's bad for you, then you have been under a rock somewhere. Maybe someone can help clarify? Maybe I need to read the book?  

For the record I am an ex-smoker.

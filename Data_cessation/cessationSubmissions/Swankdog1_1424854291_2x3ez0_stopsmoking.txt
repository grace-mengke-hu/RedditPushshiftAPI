I'm struggling so bad

I hate smoking.

I've tried so many times to stop and keep coming back to it, making the excuse I have so much stress, that I'll just never be able to stop, that I don't have the will power, and any myriad of other things. My logical mind knows there is nothing more illuminatingly clear to be a bad idea... and I rationally know all the reasons why It would be a good idea not to...yet I continue to light up.

It's affecting my work, sleep, relationships... the list goes on and on.

I feel completely out of control of my personal being in light of not having stopes 20 years ago.

Tomorrow is a new day and I will yet again try not to smoke.

Please help.

Could wearing a patch and smoking likely to have caused my accident?

Hello stop smoking I have a question for you all. About two weeks ago I tried to quit with a patch and was doing pretty good until the weekend hit. That that day early in the morning I took my patch off and did not put another on. Later that night I went to my friends house and along the way picked up some cigarettes and alcohol. I had two drinks over the course of 6 hours total and smoked a bit over half a pack with friends. I ended up running off the road on my way home and flipping my car several times, I was the sole occupant in the vehicle and no one else was hurt. After laying there for 5 hours I was found and rushed to the hospital where they airlifted me to another city for treatment. 

I ended up with a subdural hematoma and a skull fracture. While extremely grateful for being alive and thanking them the doctors had no idea what could have happened and only remember driving home then being at the hospital. At the first hospital they screened for drugs and alcohol and only trace amounts of alcohol showed up and the Investigator of the crash ruled alcohol and drugs out before that anyways. Me and my fiance are trying to remember what I ate or any medication I took and we remembered I wore a patch the day before and one of the side effect if you smoke with one or shortly after one is a stroke and or coma. 

Does anyone think this is likely or have similar experiences? I would ask my doctor however I am home now and won't see him for a month. 

Thank you and if you have any questions please ask.

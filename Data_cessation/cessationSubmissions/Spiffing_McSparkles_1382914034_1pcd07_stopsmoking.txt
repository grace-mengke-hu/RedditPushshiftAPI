Tried something new today.

Every time I got a craving I went for a run, 10, 15 or 30 minutes, it doesn't really matter.

The fun thing is: you get to run much better once you quit smoking because your lung capacity increases, this is noticeable a few days after quitting.

So if you're having troubles with cravings I highly recommend doing something like this.

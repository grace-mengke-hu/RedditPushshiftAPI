Nicotine and depression

Does anyone feel like smoking/dipping can cause depression? I use this product called Zyn 6mg nicotine pouches. I’ve been hooked the last few years and have quit for a few weeks a few times but always come back. I feel depressed sometimes and I can’t figure out why anything in my life would cause it. Could it be the nicotine messing with my dopamine levels as well as the constant withdrawal effect?

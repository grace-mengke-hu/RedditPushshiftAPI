Habits don't die easy!

I have been sick for about 2 weeks with bronchitis and I don't have time for it.

But yesterday I laid my cough drop in my little side cubby of my car where I used to keep my lighter. I laid it in there to have it ready when I was done drinking my drink. I reached for it and put it in my mouth and rolled down my window. It was the weirdest feeling. I haven't had any smoking habits in almost a year and I still did that. It felt so weird.

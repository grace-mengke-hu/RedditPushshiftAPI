Wow it's been a year today! Considering occasionally smoking socially as I am no longer addicted. Is this a bad idea?

It's 6 am in the morning and I just realized it's been a year for me. I would occasionally lurk this sub and it would help so I want to say thanks to everyone here!

Now that I've hit a year and no longer have an addiction to it I'm thinking it's okay to smoke a cigar or cigarette occasionally? I feel pretty confident that it won't turn into a problem again. Is there no harm in that or is this a trap people fall in?

Weird perk?

When I was smoking and drinking heavy my tongue was covered in this white film. All taste were muffled. Today At work I was straw tasting a beer to describe and I was blown away at just how many flavors I could taste!! 

Also, a coworker walked by me after just being out to smoke, and the smell made me legit nauseous!

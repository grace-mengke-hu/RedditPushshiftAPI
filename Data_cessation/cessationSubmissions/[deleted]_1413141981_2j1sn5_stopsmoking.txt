I feel like Superman coming back from a bad bout of Kryptonite

I've posted at different times how I once quit for ten years then stupidly fell back in the trap of smoking. I've had a hard time quitting again, but this weekend it's all coming back to me. I am remembering what it is like to be a non-smoker, i.e., not thinking about smoking at all, i.e., smoking simply not being a factor in me being happy, i.e., being as happy as one can expect just living life as a non-smoker. Then it flashes back for a second, oh yeah, yesterday I was still struggling with quitting smoking. Not anymore! I am Superman coming back from a bad bout of Kryptonite. I am back folks. Gawd this is good! I wish it upon you.

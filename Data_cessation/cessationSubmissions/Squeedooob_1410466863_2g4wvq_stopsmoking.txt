Sick after quitting?

My last cigarette was on Friday, I've smoked on and off for three years. I'm trying to quit and this seems to be the time to do it! On Wednesday I came down with a really sore throat and a lot of mucus in like my throat. Is this a symptom of quitting or just being ill? Had anyone else experienced it and if so how long did it last?

2 months smoke free after 31 years of heavy smoking

Early this summer it became painfully obvious to me: if I was ever going to enjoy life again I needed to lose weight, get fit and quit smoking. If I didn't, I would forever just be out of breath, sweaty and uncomfortable any time I go out to do something fun.

Having quit smoking before - and failed - I felt like my best bet would be to start losing some weight and doing some exercise. Once I started to enjoy my new lifestyle, I would quit smoking.

But only a week into my new "regime", it started to feel increasingly odd to smoke the amount I did (40+ a day) combined with healthy food and loads of exercise. So I changed my plan and decided to quit smoking the following day.

I remembered from my last attempts that my nicotine addiction itself didn't last very long, so I didn't plan to use vaping or patches but just sweat it out. This would prevent me from falling into the trap I fell in last time - my lack of planning made me end up at an airport without my vaping equipment, full of smoking areas, shops selling cigarettes, and and hour and a half of time to kill.

Two months on, the cravings are almost gone. I've lost 10 kilograms, I went on countless bike rides, runs, walks and swims and I feel years younger.

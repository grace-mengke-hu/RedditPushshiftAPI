Okay I'm going to try and stop smoking for good.

I've battled with quitting smoking since I had started college.

I started when I was 17 working in a pizza store. One day I was really stressed out at work and my coworkers (who all smoked) urged me to smoke a cigarette. I was so flustered and mad at the world I decided to go for it. I remember that first puff... I inhaled it directly and proceeded to cough like a bitch for a long time while everyone laughed at me.

It tasted like complete ass and I felt like a complete ass.

And yet, I continued to smoke. I'm 28 now and the longest I've gone without smoking since then is 18 months.

I want to talk more about my relationship with smoking but I'm at work so I'm leaving it there for now.

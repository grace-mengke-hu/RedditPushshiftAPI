Today I woke up.

My girlfriend smokes. My roommates smoke. My apartment is a constant haze of tobacco. I can barely get up the stairs to my apartment on the fifth floor without wheezing. I woke up today coughing, looked in the mirror, and told myself this is it. Today is the day. It's been five years, but Thursday, January 30th, 2014, is the day. Any advice?

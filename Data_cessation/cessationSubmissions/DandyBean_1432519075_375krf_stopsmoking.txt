Day 4 after quitting cigarettes and marijuana...

Jesus.

Seriously, Jesus f-Christ. I'm suffering so bloody badly. Broken out in sweats, appetite has depleted completely and the lack of sleep... Kill me now. 

After 11 years of cigarettes and 6 years of consistent smoking of marijuana, I decided to get myself into shape and get into better health.

Currently, I'm not feeling the benefits just yet. But damn it, I'm going for it, even if it kills me. It's 02:56 GMT and I haven't really slept for 3 nights. 

But determination is my guiding star. Good luck everybody, I really really mean it!

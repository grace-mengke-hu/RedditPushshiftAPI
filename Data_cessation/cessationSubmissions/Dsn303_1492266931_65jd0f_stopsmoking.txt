I just want to say hi :)

Hello, I'm new here. I quit smoking few days ago and found this place through the app Smoke Free. So I don't smoke from 4 days 5 hours and I don't know how many minutes. I just want to say to all new quitters "keep yourself busy". I can quit, we can quit. During Easter time I have a lot of time so I get bored which of course make me think about cigarettes... What I've learned is that Im probably going to have an urge to smoke for the rest of my life, my dad quit 16 years ago and says it still happens to him sometimes^^ basically we all have to be strong when the urge comes. Good luck!

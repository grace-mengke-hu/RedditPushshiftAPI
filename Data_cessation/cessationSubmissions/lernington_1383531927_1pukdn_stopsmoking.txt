Thoughts on a Craving that I just had.

I don't know if this will be especially profound, or even cohesive, but I thought I'd share, and simultaneously check in with y'all.  So as I was nearing home from my nightly walk with my dog, I look over and see a dude with a big beard, seemingly on his way home from work, enjoying a cigarette in his car.  For a moment, I let it bring me back to the times when I've been in that same car in that same moment, and how satisfying that first cigarette after work always was.  Then I started thinking of how it's been almost 3 months, and that's around the time when a lot of folks tend to relapse.  And the cravings have been making a slight resurgence.  There's something beautiful and indescribable about the perceived warmth of a glowing cigarette, billowing smoke on a chilly evening.  But maybe it is just the change in seasons, and learning to experience a shift in my surroundings without that safety blanket.  I always said that cigarettes were my happy place.  Well guess what, after nearly 3 months without them, I can certainly tell you that I'm happier this way.  I've been through some really hard times since I quit, but will be damned if they're gonna break me, and staying strong through all of that is satisfying beyond words.  Shortly after I quit, I read about how your mind likes to play tricks on you, and will create loopholes in your logic to justify relapsing.  So I came up with something to repeat to myself anytime I have a craving.

'I don't want to be a smoker for the rest of my life, and I don't ever want to go through quitting again.  I've made it far enough for it to be my choice whether or not to smoke.  Today I choose not to smoke.'

Craving gone.  Hope this has been worth reading.  Godspeed, /r/stopsmoking.  I'm doing great, and I sincerely hope that all of you are as well.

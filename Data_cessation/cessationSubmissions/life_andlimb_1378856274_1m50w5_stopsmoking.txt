I want to be a non-smoker

This is day 1 for me. Actually, I had one this morning, so day 0.5. I've been smoking 10-15 a day since moving to Seattle (not that Seattle makes me want to smoke -- I just moved alone and it's been, well, lonely) in February of this year. Before that, I was smoking 5-10 a day, starting around May of 2012. I haven't *not* had at least one cigarette a day since that time. And before May of last year, I had been smoke free since August of 2011. Why I started again is beyond me; I feel like a god damn fool. Prior to August of 2011, I had been smoking regularly, throughout college, but somehow found it quite easy to quit. Perhaps it was because I was only having 3-5 a day, but I can tell you, I never had cravings like what I'm experiencing right now.

I'm quitting because I want to be attractive to the opposite sex again; I want to be able to run 6 miles straight again without feeling like I'm dying; I want my parents to be proud of me as well as my lifestyle. I don't want to take away time I could be spending with my friends just to go outside and have a smoke. I want to save my $50 a week. Most of all, I want to be free of this bullshit.

Any input from you heavier smokers that quit cold turkey would be much appreciated. Encouragement of any kind is welcome -- I want to be better than this.

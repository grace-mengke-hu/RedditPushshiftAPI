Accepting your slow consciously aware suicide

Is exactly what being a smoking is. As a smoker, you are completely aware of the poison you are injecting, but we did it anyway, accepting the idea that it hasn't immediately affected me, so when it does, I will worry about it then. Such a terrible thought process that exists within the addict. It is like taking a little tiny gun and putting it in your mouth and pulling the trigger every time you have a smoke, it doesn't kill you right away, but enough times pulling that trigger and it definitely will. It is a wicked game we play with our lives, it is a gamble with death with the hopes to survive among all the evidence that you won't. We don't necessarily want to die, but we want to be able to do what we want and get away with it, prove them wrong. We must have a complete and utter psychological perspective change to rid of this thought process and build a better reason to live. 

Those are my thoughts for today, as I once again become a non-smoker on day 5. Good luck and stay strong to all the others putting down the cigs today.

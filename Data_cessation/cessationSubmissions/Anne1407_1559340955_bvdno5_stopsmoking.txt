Some observations

I counted my cravings. I quit January 2nd of this year.
January: 75 cravings   
February: 38 cravings   
March: 66 cravings (My first day without NRT was March 1, so the higher number makes sense)  
April: 47 cravings   
May: 15 cravings   

It really does get better, with every day or month.

Okay all, let Day 1 commence!

Countless reasons to quit, not one reason to keep it going. I'm at 4 or 5 a day, this should be easy, right? Haha, quite the contrary it seems. For me, 3 days isn't bad. It's usually around the 4th or 5th that gets me. Shoot, I can go a week without it bothering me. Then it hits. It's like hunger. Maybe a magnet. It draws me in, but as much as I fight it, it has always won. It draws me in the same way I draw it in to me. With pain. Failure. Disappointment. I draw it in with thoughts of past friends, unhealthy family, and lost loved ones, and it draws me into fear. I will win. I will quit. I will stop, for there is no point in continuing down this path of self destruction. If I owe myself one thing, it's this of all things.

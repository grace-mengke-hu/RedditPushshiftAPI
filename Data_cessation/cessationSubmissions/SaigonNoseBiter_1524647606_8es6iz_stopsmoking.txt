Is there any way to induce extra phlegm in my lungs in an effort to clean them out more quickly following a recent quit?

From my research on the topic, it seems like the only way to 'clean' out my lungs is time.  However, it seems like I spit out a lot of dark stuff combined with phlegm in the mornings and after meals.  This seems to be the natural way that my body cleans itself.  Since there are no drugs or substances available to simulate this, I have theorized that if I can somehow induce extra phlegm that my lungs will be able to clean themselves out more quickly.  Can anyone confirm or disprove this theory?  And does anyone know how to do this?

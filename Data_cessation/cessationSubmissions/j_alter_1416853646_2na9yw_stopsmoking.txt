I'm done

I just unsubscribed to this sub. It's been a crazy ride but it has gotten to the point of these posts are the only reminders that I once was a smoker. I'm on mobile so I don't know my total quit time, but I just wanted to part with some encouraging words.  

You all can do it. You are stronger than you believe and I promise it gets easier. Replace smoking with something physical to keep you honest. Or if you aren't up for that just remember even the worse craving is only temporary and is a personal battle.  Take small steps to beat your own internal monologue, and soon enough you can post something like this.

Happy holidays.

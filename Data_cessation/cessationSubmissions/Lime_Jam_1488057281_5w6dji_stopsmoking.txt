I just destroyed all my cigarettes.

I've been feeling shit recently. I take kratom, but I feel rubbish on it after smoking. Can cigarettes make you dehydrated and give you bloodshot eyes? I was only having 2-3 a day, but even that amount made me feel shit. I quit smoking once thanks to kratom, I can again. I locked the cigarettes in a box but they were tempting. I realised I had to destroy them. I have vapes to ease cravings. I can do this, I want to feel normal and not I'll again.

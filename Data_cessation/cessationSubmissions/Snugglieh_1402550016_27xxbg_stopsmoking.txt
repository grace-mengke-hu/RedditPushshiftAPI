I just want to tell you a story..

..about how I decided to quit. 

Yesterday during a break in school on 9:45 AM. I was smoking the last cigarette of my pack and didn't even think of quitting what so ever. 

I only thought of what the next lessons would feel like, with a nicotine craving. So I told myself : I quit now. 

The next 6 lessons were horrible. I felt horrible. My stomach was aching, my head was aching aswell. I'm staying at home today. But at the moment, I don't have any cravings.

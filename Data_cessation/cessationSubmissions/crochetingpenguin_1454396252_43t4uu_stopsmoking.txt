I was told I have to quit smoking.

I went to my ENT today for a follow-up on a nasty, month+ long ear infection I had. I have had ear problems my whole life in my right ear, causing infections, perforations, and hearing loss. There's a possibility I could get my ears fixed, now that I'm an adult. However, my ENT told me today that they won't fix my ear unless I quit smoking. This is a huge deal for me, but nicotine is such a huge addiction. How do I quit smoking in this situation?

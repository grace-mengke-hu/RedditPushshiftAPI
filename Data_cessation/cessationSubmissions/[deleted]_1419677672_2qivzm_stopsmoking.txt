This my 50th "Day One", I think.

Isn't it absolutely terrifying how addictive cigarettes are? In the past three or four months, I have been engaged in a tumultuous battle with my cigarette addiction. I've tried to quit cold turkey a number of times, but to no avail. 

Yesterday, I bought a personal vaporizer. I know there's a number of people who don't believe switching to a PV can be considered "quitting", but I do. I know that the e-liquids contain nicotine, but that isn't the most dangerous ingredient found in cigarettes. I wanted to stop inhaling arsenic, butane, cadmium, lead, etc. I also grew so very tired of how horrible cigarettes smell - I cannot stand the way my hair and my clothes smell after I smoke. I am also tired of the smoker's cough that I've acquired and the heavy feeling in my chest.

In an effort to try to curb cravings for a real cigarette, I bought an e-liquid called "Cowboy", which has a taste that closely resembles Marlboro Lights. It also contains 1.2% nicotine. When this bottle is empty, I am going to purchase a liquid that is more flavorful - something fruit based that has a lower nicotine content.

I am hoping to notice positive changes soon as my body repairs itself from the damage done from burning analog cigarettes.

Utterly uninterested in smoking when sober, but can't seem to resist when drunk. Any ideas?

So, I've never been a *smoker*-smoker, but I've noticed that over the course of the last 10 years, that I now will smoke maybe 10-20 cigs on a night out, rather than 2 or 3.

When I am sober, even the thought of a cigarette makes me want to puke, and for that I am very grateful. But, once I go past a certain threshold of beer, all bets are off.

When I go to places that have no possibilities to smoke, or with people who do not smoke, the temptation does not arise, either.

But my local bar (that I adore) still has a smoking area, and also a lot of smokers. So I always tend to get caught up. I don't go there super often, once every couple of weeks, but I still just wish I could resist the lure of Ol' Nick!

Is it worth me getting a vape or trying some gum as a stop gap to see if that helps?

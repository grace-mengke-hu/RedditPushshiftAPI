Carbon Monoxide test..

1st time I did it a couple of weeks ago the reading was 24/25.  Today I did it again and the reading was 1. Can't tell you how happy that made me :) 

I also told my advisor at the docs about this forum and how it's really helped me not to smoke, he was really interested and said he'd check it out, perhaps he will point other people this way! 

Hope everyone has a good day not smoking! 😊👍

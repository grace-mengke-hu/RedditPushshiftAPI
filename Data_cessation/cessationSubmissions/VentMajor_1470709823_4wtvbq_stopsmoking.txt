Day 1

Well I am at my quit date.... ( tomorrow 8/9.) I have been fighting this demon for a long time! But tomorrow I WILL NOT SMOKE!!!! I am going the cold turkey route. I have tried the patches, gum (kept losing the pack), tried switching to vaping and nothing has worked. The research I have done is to have something to occupy my hands and mind for 15 to 20 minutes to allow for the cravings to pass. This is my plan, any suggestions/encouragements is always appreciated! HERE WE GO!!!!!

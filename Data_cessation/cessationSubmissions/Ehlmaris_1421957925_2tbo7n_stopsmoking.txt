Two months. Kinda.

I got a prescription for Chantix on 11/17/14, filled it 11/18, stopped smoking a few days later. I've had a couple since then (super stressed this week, bummed two cigarettes from friends over the past seven days) but overall I'm doing well.

Just gotta remind myself that you don't quit once, it's an ongoing process. I am still an ex-smoker, even if I have occasional moments of weakness.

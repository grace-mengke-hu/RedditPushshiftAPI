Day Two

So, I finally took the plunge. I'm using patches (starting at 24mg - was a pack a day smoker for 7 years) and I have no desire to go back. But, I am getting something weird; I've had a stitch in my right side (just under where my underwire sits) all day and it hurts when I inhale deeply. What's up with that? Is that normal?

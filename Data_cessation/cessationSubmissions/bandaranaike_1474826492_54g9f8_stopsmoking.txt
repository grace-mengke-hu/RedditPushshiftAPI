After 20 years of pack-a-day smoking, not smoking for 2 weeks

Hi guys, long time follower here, just wanted to chim in and give some feedback. I've been smoking since i was 14, and after 20 years of active, addictive smoking I've finally managed to -I'm not going to say "quit" - not smoke, for two weeks now. This subreddit has been of significant help with all the stories and messages of support. So thank you for that.

As to how I did it, I think everyone has his or hers way. For me it was plain persistence that did it. For six months now I've been trying to quit, failing and trying again. Also I've been reading about nicotine addiction a lot, how it work chemically and biologically - that helped a lot for me. So for the past two months basically every day i said to myself this is the day, and have failed. If make it through the day, I would fail miserably and go out to buy a pack. I even started throwing packs in the garbage just after buying them and smoking one of two.

So for me, after all this effort it would be an incredible failure to light a cigarette. I have urges but they are not that severe. I call them my Jekyll and Hyde moments.

Also meditating helps. I was so addicted and so frustrated with my inability to quit, that I realized a larger change was needed. Kind of "personal pivoting" towards a healthier life, both mentally and physically. At the age of 34, it was about time. 

So, is you haven't quit yet but you want to badly - just keep at it, and don't let one failure derail you. Hell, don't let thousand failures derail you. Best of luck.

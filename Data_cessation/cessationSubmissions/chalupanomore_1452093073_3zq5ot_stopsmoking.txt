I am so frustrated today.

I went through another two days of not sleeping, was finally able to sleep last night so of course I slept in this morning, put on some brand new jeans(which I've just washed but never worn) and there's a hole in them, and I haven't pooped in like two days. I'm going to lose my mind.

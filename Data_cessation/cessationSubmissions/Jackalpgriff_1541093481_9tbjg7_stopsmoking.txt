Day 3

Not going to lie, this shit sucks. I have been a smoker since I was 16 (now 26) and at my worst i smoked a pack a day. I am only on day 3 and the cravings for cigs are not nearly as bad as they have been but holy shit I feel like so god damn hungry. Like I’m a fat dude already, I lost a lot of weight over this past year and now I’m worried I’m going to gain it all back.  Anyone else experience that or have any tips?

Also this subreddit has been helpful. whenever I feel like smoking I read about everyone else’s successes and it’s inspiring. I have a good feeling that this will actually be the time I really give up smoking.

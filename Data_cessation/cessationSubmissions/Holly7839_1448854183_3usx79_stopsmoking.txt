Don't give up!

I quit on New Years this year and I genuinely haven't felt better. I hardly ever think about it, and when i do, its just a brief 'I can't believe I spent so much money on something that made me smell so bad!' 

I used to smoke between 15 and 20 a day and couldn't think about stopping without getting the shakes. Somehow I managed to quit cold turkey and haven't looked back!

All the posts I read when I quit were so helpful, so if you are struggling keep going, it gets easier, we've all been there! 

Seriously guys, It can be shit, but the fact is if you want to do it, you can do it!!!!

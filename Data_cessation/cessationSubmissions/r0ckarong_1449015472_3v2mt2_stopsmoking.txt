Finally found my metaphor

For the longest time since my quit I tried to find a suitable metaphor for what being around smokers feels like to me. Just to get a leverage over this feeling.

We have a smokers room at work where my few smoking colleagues still hang out. Unfortunately some of the people I have to work with the closest smoke and hang out in there all the time.

I then have to stand in there and talk to them if I have a question. Today though I watched another colleague who never smoked stand in there for a while. I never understood how the non-smokers can just walk in there and hang out whereas I constantly feel on edge and have to keep myself from lashing out.

So I imagined it like this: you've been in the desert for a year. You're thirsty as fuck and would kill for even a drop of water. Then you go and stand in a room with someone who constantly keeps spraying a fine mist of water into your face. Your craving loves that feeling, its temptation itself but you can never ever actually quench your thirst from it.

But there is no water there. Its just the illusion.

My never smoking colleagues have the advantage that they don't know the desert. They don't even know what water is. They just don't care and all it is to them is a moist nuisance that goes away once you leave that place.

For me it's a major fight to not simply give in to the illusion and choose the "ignorance is bliss" route again.

I don't envy either of them. I walked the dunes of withdrawal. I do pity those dying in the sands for they think water exists. I see the oases for what they are dry, smoke free everywheres.

Three weeks! Yes we can!

26 years smoking. I quit 15 years ago  and I didn't smoke for two years but one day I did the most stupid thing I ve ever done in my life. I smoke one cig not because I really wanted it but just to celebrate something!!!! Of course I didn't start to smoke and I thought I could control it. But here I am. This is the good one. Three weeks since I quit and with the knowledge now I can never smoke again because I can't lie to myself.

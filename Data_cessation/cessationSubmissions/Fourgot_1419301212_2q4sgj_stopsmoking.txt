One kday

It's a kiloday, a thousand days since the last time I had nicotine of any kind, three years since my last smoke yesterday.

Can't tell you how many times I quit smoking before I finally stopped. I did the gum for a few months, and then I read that book this sub was always talking about... Easy Way to Stop Smoking by Allen Carr.

This book was my way out, but I happened to be in the right place, too. This sub was a big part of it for me, too.

You're not quitting anything. You're not giving up anything. You're not sacrificing anything.

You're putting something down that you've outgrown. And that's fuckin awesome.

We got this.

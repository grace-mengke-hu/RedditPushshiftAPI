Just quit again yesterday, really hoping I can do it this time!

I smoke a pack a day, I failed quitting cold turkey hundreds of times in the past few months probably, but once I made it 27 days and another time I made it 10 days. I really need to quit, I'm 26 and I'm at that point where I need to be taking my health seriously. I have a wonderful new GF that is supporting me and even bought me a non-nicotine vape pen to help with urges (lucky me!), and just went for the first jog I've been on in MONTHS this morning (I don't jog when I am a smoker). The jog felt great but wow I didn't realize how out of shape I really was. 

Looking for tips and encouragement, the biggest times I have the need to smoke is:

- In the mornings with my coffee.
- At the breaks at my work.
- While driving.
- After sex.
- After I finish smoking a bowl of weed.

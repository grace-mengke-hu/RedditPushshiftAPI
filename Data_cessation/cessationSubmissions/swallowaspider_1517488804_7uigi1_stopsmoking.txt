The silver lining to an asthma relapse combined with a chest infection...

My quit date was 16th December 2017. Iâ€™ve had cigarettes now and again. I had a meltdown at the beginning of January that lasted 5 days and I did smoke about 10 over those 5 days. I didnâ€™t change the quit date on my app as it still listed all the benefits I still had made towards my health even when the percentages were adjusted after I smoked. In the last couple of weeks my asthma has been bad and I also have a chest infection. I ended up in hospital with fluids and oxygen because of this. But yanno what? For the last two weeks Iâ€™ve had ZERO thoughts about even touching a cigarette! I use my e-cig but even then I donâ€™t think about smoking! I canâ€™t believe that on my Smokefree app I have every single day from 18th January as â€˜Not smokedâ€™ and â€˜ZERO cravingsâ€™!!! Iâ€™ll know Iâ€™m starting to get better as Iâ€™ll start craving one when Iâ€™m stressed again but for now Iâ€™m going to look at the positive side of being sofa bound and sleeping 80% if the day ðŸ˜‚

7am Day 4 cold turkey

My neck is killing me, i finally pooped last night, so hungry all the time trying not to over eat because gaining weight was what always scared me about quitting. Neck hurts so bad, the flu like symptoms seem to be not as bad as they were yesterday but i dont mind it means my lungs and throat are repairing themselves. I have 10 hours of a work shift today its gunna be a doozy.

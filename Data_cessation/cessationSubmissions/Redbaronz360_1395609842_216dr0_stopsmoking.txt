Just had my last cigarette...

...this afternoon.

Backstory: My college uses a program called QuitSmart. It gradually lowers your nicotine intake by brand switching the smoker to lower levels of nicotine. The last pack that I had, Merit Ultimas, not only tasted terrible but had almost no nicotine.

Part of the program is lowering the nicotine level per cig, the other part is not compensating by smoking more of the light, or ultra light.

I encourage anyone struggling to look at it! I know that since I started, my headaches have all but disappeared (used to get bad craving headaches, now I get no headaches and smaller cravings).

Tonight, however, starts the fight. I am in this brothers and sisters!

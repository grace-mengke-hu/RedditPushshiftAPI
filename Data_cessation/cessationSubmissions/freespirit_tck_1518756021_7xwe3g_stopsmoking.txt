Fighting cravings during excited and/or cringe-worthy moments?

Hi Guys,

I used to smoke on average 4-6 cigs/per day since over 9 years. Have tried to stop since a week now. It's been good but recently I smoked one or two here and there. Far less than what it was and wont certainly consider it a relapse but certainly a slip-up. What I noticed is that during moments when I am excited like I just got a good lead for a job a few days back I was really tempted to smoke one and I caved. Similarly, I once had a cringe-worthy memory flooding back and immediately smoked. I tend to be pretty good at being able to drink yet not smoke but I noticed no matter what I do whenever I get excited or cringe the urge is too hard to resist. Any advice would be much appreciated. Cheers!

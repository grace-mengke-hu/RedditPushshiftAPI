Question for those who quit tobacco with vaping.

How long did it take for your lungs to feel normal again?

I'm about 10 days in and they still feel a little gunged up. With previous cold-turkey attempts, I felt my lungs clearing after a mere 3-4 days. So I'm not sure what's up.

If it makes any difference, I'm currently using a USB pass-through (4.2V) with a 2.5 Ohm Clearomiser. The liquid is 3.6% 50-50 VG-PG.

Anybody start running when they quit smoking?

I'm looking for a little advice.

Day 4 is going well, and I am very excited and proud of myself.  The cravings happen, and I just suffer through them and try to distract my brain.  I began doing the couch to 5k program two weeks ago.  I haven't coughed anything up yet from quitting. I am wondering if this is something that happens later on and if it effects your running schedule/ability to run?

Thanks for all the support!  You guys are awesome!

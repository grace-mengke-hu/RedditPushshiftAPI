Twelve hours in and sobbing

I quit smoking 12.6 hours ago. I'm out of work and home alone all day; when my husband's home he usually plays video games. I go outside and smoke and listen to podcasts. It keeps me from feeling so lonely. It's like a friend. 

So I'm home alone, it's mid-day, and I'm just sobbing. I'm so lonely and hurt and I feel like a friend has died. I really have no desire to quit, but everyone wants me to. 

I don't know if it's relevant, but I'm bipolar, severely depressive type. So all the "it'll kill you!" arguments bounce right off me, because I don't really care if it does. I'd rather have the comfort right now so I can get through the day. 

I guess I just want to know if anyone else grieved over quitting. I'm trying to find the strength to hold out, but having a meltdown 12 hours in doesn't seem like an indicator for success.

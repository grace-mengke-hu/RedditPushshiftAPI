Considering relapse

This is day Nr. 13 without nicotine for me. For most part it was pretty easy, but for some reason I'm really struggling for the past 2 days, the cravings have been insane the past 48 hours. I feel like I can't take it anymore. My life already sucks. I literally spend all day infont of my laptop every single day in my life because I have nothing else to do. I have no friends. I'm struggling financially (but cigarettes aren't that expensive where I live so they don't affect me much financially).

Smoking was the only joy in my life. Only thing to look forward. I feel like starting again. I feel like I can't take it anymore. I know I can quit apparently, perhaps I should quit when things are better in my life when I have something to look forward other than cigarettes. Maybe I will never quit smoking again. All I know I can't take it anymore, the past 48 hours have been hell.

Why am I posting here? Maybe I'm searching for some inspiring post that will stop me from relapsing. Maybe I'm looking for approval to relapse (which I obviously won't get here).

I'm confused. Very very confused. I want to smoke, I want to escape my stupid life every hour for 10 minutes, I want something too look forward to.

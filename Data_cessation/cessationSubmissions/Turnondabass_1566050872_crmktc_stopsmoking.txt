13 Days Smoke-Free, cold turkey

I have been smoking for the past 15 years. Ive had some quite life changing events in the past two years and I smoked less and less, day by day. I moved abroad because of a great job (my first real full time job), my surroundings completely changed, I had less smokers around, and I became happier and happier. This is crucial. When I decided to give it a shot and quit. I noticed that the biggest challenge is the smoker identity, If you think of yourself as a healthy non-smoker, it really does something. I feel way healthier, cleaner, and certainly happier, I cant even describe the energy. Kinda hope that this wont change!

The 100 dollar cigarette, or how I'm successfully quitting smoking

I've smoked about a pack every 2 days for the past about 2-3 years. After multiple attempts trying to quit, all of them fails, I came upon the only method that worked for me.
I met up with my friend, and we made a bet: the first one of us to smoke a cigarette has to give the other one 100$.

As simple as that, as long as your honestly committed to quitting, there's never gonna be the 100$ cigarette. This is the only method that actually got me in a place where all I do is vape. I still don't smoke when drunk, which is when I'd usually crave a dart, only because there's never gonna be a cigarette worth 100$.

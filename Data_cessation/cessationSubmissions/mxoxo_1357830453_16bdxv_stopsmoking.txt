/r/stopsmoking, I failed after 6 days. I've today been prescribed Champix and I have a few questions that I didn't think of at the time.

Mainly -

My doctor said Champix need time to start working. So I can carry on smoking for 2~ weeks. Best thing to do is set myself a date in the second week to stop completely. 

I haven't picked up my prescription yet, but I still haven't had a cigarette since yesterday. I'm still having cravings (obviously) but I'm resisting. 

Am I affecting how effective the Champix will be by stopping smoking before I've started taking the medication? 

I'll say now, I'm likely to fail anyway. I will end up smoking tonight, as I do every night. But atm I'm fighting. I'm sitting here wondering though whether I might be as well to just smoke until I'm taking the meds / smoke until my set target date in the second week of meds.

Thanks in advance

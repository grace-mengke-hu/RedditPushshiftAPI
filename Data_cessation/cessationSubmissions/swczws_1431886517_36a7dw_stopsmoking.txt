Summer and smoking

One of my favorite things used to be to sit outside and smoke... while enjoying the weather.  I've started doing that again and I've been missing smoking.  Also been having dreams that out of sheer habit I've grabbed a cigarette and lit up... usually I don't realize what I did until hours later in the dream.  Then last night I was with a group that had some smokers... and it smelled good!! 

I'm gonna stay strong... but even after this long, it's hard!!!

Reasons why I quit

I'm 26 hours into my quit attempt. Still on patches, but I'm committed to never smoking a cigarette again. Just writing out some reasons why I quit, to motivate myself and hopefully others.

1) Smoking wastes so much time in the day - takes me about 6 minutes to smoke 1, and I smoked 20 a day, so that's 2 hours a day wasted!

2) It made me feel unhealthy - It didn't matter what I was eating, or whether I was exercising, there's just this underlying shitty feeling when you're a smoker, as you know you're poisoning yourself constantly. 

3) No more feeling guilty

4) I feel like I'm actually working towards something, like I've accomplished something. It's very early days, but it's a good feeling. 

5) Money - I'm not rich, I live at home with my parents and have no income, smoking wastes so much money. 

6) I have physics exams which last 3 hours each in June, and I will be able to make it through them without craving a cigarette. 

Thanks for reading. Good luck to everyone else on their journeys :)

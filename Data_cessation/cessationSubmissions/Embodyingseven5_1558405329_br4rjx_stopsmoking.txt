I need advice on getting my mom and dad to quit smoking.

My mom and dad know smoking is bad and that they should stop. They have never put a plan to stop smoking into action and I fear my father specifically will make his current health issues worse if he doesn't stop immediately.  How can I get them on a plan to stop smoking? I haven't approached them over smoking in a long time, but they have got to stop.  How can I get them started on the right path? My parents aren't great at sticking to things like this so what can I do as a son to help?

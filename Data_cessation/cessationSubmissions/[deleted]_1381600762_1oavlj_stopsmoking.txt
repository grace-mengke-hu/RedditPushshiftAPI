Ok mothertruckers. Day one.

Here I go. 13 years ago was when it started. That was the summer before my Sophmore year in high school. The year I quit caring. I weighed 185, was a multi sport athlete, ate healthy, and was drug free. But then I hit a wave of teenage angst, and depression. Typical teenager stuff. Lost my girlfriend. Discovered weed, painkillers, booze and cigarettes. 

Over the course of the next decade I ballooned up to 370 pounds. May 2012 I was in the worst shape of my life. 

But I found the motivation to change things. Since then I started eating healthy, exercising, and doing the things I needed to do. Except one. 

I've lost 130 pounds, I'm more active than I've been since the 90s. And the final piece of the puzzle of becoming the person I want to be is quitting smoking. And now is the time to do it. It's on. Let's do it.

Is there anything wrong with wearing a Nicoderm patch for multiple days?

I started wearing the 21mg patch yesterday and accidentally left it on overnight. I decided to leave it on, it’s mid-morning and I’m still feeling the effectiveness. I’m thinking of leaving it in place till I feel an urge to smoke again. Is there any harm in this?

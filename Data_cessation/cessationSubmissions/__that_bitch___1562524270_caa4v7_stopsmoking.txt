Can I do it again? I'm scared and I don't trust myself.

I read Alan Carr's book a few months back. What a game changer! Nothing has ever worked for me before. I quit smoking after over 20 years both willingly and peacefully. I just...became a non smoker.

I lived in that peace for a few weeks to a month. Then some events happened that rocked my world. They were hugely traumatizing events that also triggered my PTSD and I was struggling to make it through each day. I remember kind of being in a fog and going out to buy cigarettes. I didn't even *like* that first pack. It was just so second nature. I was wholly unprepared for how I'd cope because this was so much bigger than day to day life events. I don't think I'd been quit long enough for something like that to happen.

Now I'm back to smoking and vaping. I want to quit again, but I'm scared. Maybe scared isn't the right word. I have a lot of trepidation.

I could reread the book again, but would it work a second time?

I feel like such a failure and I don't believe in myself to actually do this thing once and for all.

One week today!

...Again! I have had a few attempts at quitting since mid-November, and a few slip ups along the way, usually involving alcohol and close friends that still smoke. 

Although I am now 7 days nicotine free, I do feel like I still haven't managed to deal with this trigger (although saying that I did manage to go out and drink with some friends last night and not smoke, I just find it hard). 

I enjoy being a non-smoker so much, so many benefits, I do really want to stick at this, even though I have had so slip up. 

Stay strong everyone

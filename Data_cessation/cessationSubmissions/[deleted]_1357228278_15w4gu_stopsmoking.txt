This is irritating.

I can't take this anymore. I feel like a failure and a slave after every cigarette but that feeling slowly goes away in an hour and there I am again outside smoking another one. I have no motivation to quit at home because my house mates smoke and no motivation at work because both my co workers smoke. I want to quit and this is no New Years resolution. I don't no where to start or what methods to get information from. In other words: Help.

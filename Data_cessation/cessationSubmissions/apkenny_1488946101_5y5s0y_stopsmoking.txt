On the night of day 4 smoke-free, desperately craving. How do I make it another 4 days? (Let alone tonight)

This is the night of day 4 smoke free. I am in my ealry 20s and have been smoking a pack and a half a day since I was 14. I have been using the 21/mg patch and chewing nicotine gum. Tonight the cravings are worse than they have ever been. My wife smokes, so the sight and smell is not helping. How the hell am I supposed to make it another 4 days? Any advice to help prevent myself from caving with the crazy cravings? Thanks so much reddit!

Day 5

Hi all!

I'm day 5 into my smoke free life. I've attempted to quit plenty of times before, although this time feels different as I WANT to quit rather than I think I NEED to quit.

I'm also kicking the booze at the same time. I was a pretty heavy drinker and would down about a fifth of vodka every other day and smoke about a pack of cigs a day.

So far I feel great. I already notice a difference in my energy level and also all-around mental clarity. My cravings are slowly dissipating and aren't as crazy as they were on days 1 -3.

Has anyone else here quit smoking and drinking at the same time who could offer some encouragement and/or advice?

Thanks!

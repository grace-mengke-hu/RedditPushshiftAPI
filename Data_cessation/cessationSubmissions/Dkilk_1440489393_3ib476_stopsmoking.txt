Question - tired all the time

I am on day 34 and cannot describe how exhausted I feel,  I was a very heavy smoker for 30 years and I keep reading about improved energy levels, that is certainly not my experience - in fact, I am permanently tired..I know there is no normal for everyone. But has anyone else experienced similar ?

Just crumpled up my last pack. I'm done.

I was going to finish the pack that I had, but I realized it feels much better and more accomplishing to stop right now. I hate relying on these things to relieve me of stress and whatnot, because I realize there are better outlets.

I didn't have much to say, but all I wanted was to share that I'm fed up with smoking and I'm stopping. I ** will not** buy another pack. I'm done. Thanks for reading.

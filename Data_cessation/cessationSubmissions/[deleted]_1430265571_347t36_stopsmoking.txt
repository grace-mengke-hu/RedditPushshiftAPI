Smoking since I was 13 and i'm 19 now.

Hi,

I've been smoking since the age of 13. I grew up in a pretty bad enviroment so I experienced allot with Drugs etc.. the only drug that stuck to me was sigarettes.

I've never thought about quitting but i'm feeling like i've some health problems now. Everytime I smoke I feel pain in my chest and my whole throat hurts, every morning my mouth taste's like shit, I smell gross and my condition is the worst. 

I've come to this subreddit to look for some tips that will help me quit, I smoke 1+ pack of sigarret's a day, mostly on school i'll smoke everytime I have a break with my friends. 

So yeah.. please give me some tips to quit smoking it'll be highly appreciated.

Sorry for bad english.

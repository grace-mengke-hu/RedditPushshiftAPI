so i starts again

already quit numerous times but always started again. 
Most of the time im going back to smoking when im in a stressfull situatoin or one is comming up. 
But my biggest problem is the amount i smoke if i do. 
Depanding on the stress i smoke 10 to 20 cig a day.
Im only 22 and i dont want to hurt myself and my body anymore.
and so its starts again day 1

Stopping again! Advice needed

Hi everyone, I've been smoking for over 20 years, I'm going to be 40 this month and I was just looking some advice. I've tried everything to quit, from hypnotherapy to champix. I find that once I try something new I might stop for a short while and then start again. The longest I've stopped was 3 months after hypnosis and another 3 months after champix. Over 2 months ago I discovered the smoke free app and from using that, I managed to stop for 2 months. But Friday week ago(3rd of May) I began to dabble again. I had been on 20 before discovering the app, I smoked 5 yesterday and 2 already today (it's 9.45am here in Ireland). It seems that once I break the latest fad that I've utilized to stop smoking, then I just go f\*\*k it and start again. A lot of my close friends are smokers too. I was just wondering if anyone had any good advice or does anyone use any positive reinforcement techniques to keep themselves from smoking? (I would def recommend the smoke free app by the way, I found it very useful, though I think it might be even better if it gave even more updates on how your health benefits have increased). thanks everyone and good luck in quitting! These bloody things should be made illegal!

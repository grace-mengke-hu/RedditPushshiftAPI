What trigger surprised you?

I'm on my sixth day of quit and have met most of my triggers with a calm confidence. I expected most of them: social events, parties, being by the pool, tubing, being out in nature, driving, getting off of work, drinking. But one really, really surprised me and I realized why quitting can be so hard. 
I took a day trip a couple hours up state on Thursday, and we stopped at a rest stop and BAM! I wanted one. I did NOT see that coming either. I guess, thinking back on it, each time I've been at a rest stop in the past fourteen years I've probably lit up a cigarette while everyone else was heading for the bathrooms. I didn't smoke, but I did remind myself that there are probably so many other countless triggers that I may not happen upon for weeks or months. 
Did you have any surprise triggers? What were they?

Need your help with an office contest

So, we have smokers in the office (shocking, I know), and they want to quit, but need motivation.  For the last 2 months we have had a biggest loser contest, and want to do something like that with a prize to get people involved.  I was wondering if anyone has done a contest like this or has ideas/rules for one.

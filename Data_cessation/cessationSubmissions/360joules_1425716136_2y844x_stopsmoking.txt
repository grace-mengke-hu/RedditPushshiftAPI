One week!

I didn't post at the beginning of my quit, because I wasn't sure I'd make it, and failure is worse with an audience. 

After a week, though, I'm feeling pretty strong, so I thought I'd come and share with you all. Even when I failed before, I kept lurking here, and you've all been so inspiring! 

Thank you all!

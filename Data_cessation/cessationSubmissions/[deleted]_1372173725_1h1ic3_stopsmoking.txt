Attempt #2 (First ever post on Reddit!)

I am somewhat of an odd case. I work a normal office job, and I do not have the urge to smoke at all during the day. I usually have one cig in the morning before work, and 3 or 4 after work. Weekends are another story, I can have anywhere from 4-8 on a Saturday or Sunday – depending on my schedule (I don’t smoke around family, or friends that don’t smoke). I've only been smoking since 2010, where I started out only having 1 or 2 a week from my roommates pack!

At the beginning of March I read Allen Carr's book and successfully quit for 45 days! I felt awesome, I could breathe again, the weird pains in my legs went away, and I even got halfway through the couch to 5K program. 

Unfortunately, I caved in and had a few cigs while out drinking with some friends one day. I still went a whole week after that without having any, but it set me off course, I started making excuses of why I could have "just one" and before I knew it I was back to my normal habit. Since then I have put numerous packs of cigs under the kitchen sink, but ended up at the convenience store the next day every time.

So this morning I decided I would have my last cig and make a good attempt at quitting. I’m re-reading the Easy Way book and am about half way through. 

Wish me luck! Any additional tips are welcome!

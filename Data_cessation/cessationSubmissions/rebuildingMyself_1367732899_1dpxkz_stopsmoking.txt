30 Day Check-in.

Hey guys. I used the nicotine mint for about 10 days and then cut that off. I've been free ever since. Here's my improvements:

1. No more night coughing, which was starting to scare me.
2. I've become much more motivated to hit the gym which is working down my gut a bit.
3. Sex performance has improved dramatically. I would always be out of breath after about a minute or so in missionary (to my g/f's disappointment). Not anymore.
4. Breath/clothes are smoke free. My brother-in-law had to excuse himself out of the room if I was there because he says the smell of smoke gives him a headache. Thankfully that won't be a problem anymore.

I just want to thank this community here for giving me the support. Thanks for reading and I hope this post helps inspire some of you out there struggling over that first god-awful week bump.

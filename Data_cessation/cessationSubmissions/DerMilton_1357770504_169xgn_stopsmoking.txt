Just had the best Sex of my life.

So this morning I read the post about how somebody has a significantly increased potential when it comes to sexual matters. And I can only approve. 

The title says is... If I knew that quitting cigarettes would cause this much different... Man... I would have never started. 

Keep it up guys. =)

I feel like a goddamn monster: Day 15

I was directed to this subreddit by another fellow redditor. I decided after 2 years of smoking to quit cold turkey, and I completely under-estimated this process. I figured I hadn't been smoking for long so therefore I could quit easier, right? Wrong, so wrong. 

I feel like a goddamn monster. If I'm not irritated then I'm ready to cry, I'm eating everything in sight. I am lucky to have the most supportive friends a person could ask for. They've stood by me through all of my freakouts and whining so far, and they've even supplied me 6 months worth of mints and hard candies. I've treated them like garbage, and I don't deserve it at all yet they continue to cheer me on.

I figured after 2 weeks it'd feel easier by now, right? Wrong again. All I ask is this, when did you finally start to feel like a decent human being again? And anymore tricks other than hard candies and gum? Thanks a bunch.

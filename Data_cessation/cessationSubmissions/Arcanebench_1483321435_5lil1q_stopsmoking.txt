Giving up smoking cold turkey tomorrow. What can I expect?

Technically my last cigarette was this morning so tomorrow will be my first full day. 
Edit 1 : Although I haven't smoked for a full 24 hours this will be my first full day. 
It's hard this morning as I would usually have a cigarette maybe 3 in the first few hours. I've decided to list down why I'm stopping for my own focus and accountability. 
Here goes 
- I can't afford to smoke. There is No way to justify this as I simply can not afford £10 a day to smoke. It's ridiculous. 
There are 4 people in my household me, my so and two teenagers. Could we afford to give everyone £10 a day to blow on whoever they wanted. - NO. So how can I justify this as a one person luxury when it only benefits me. 

- I'm in the U.K and cigarettes are changing, the tobacco and paper used have changed almost overnight my regular brand have become something that teenage me might have concocted from broken cigarettes and a dirty rizla. 
I started to get annoyed as I had just spent £10 but realised I was wanted to give up and this would be the perfect time when I don't even like or enjoy them. 

- My teeth, although not awful my dentist commented by asking me how many cigarettes I smoke...it must be visible. Eventually I would like to get my teeth whitened, there is no point if I'm smoking. 

- and of course....I WANT to be as healthy as I can for myself and my children. 

All this typing about cigarettes is making me want one so I'm going to leave it for today. I'm writing this for my own benefit but if anyone has any help or advice please let me know.

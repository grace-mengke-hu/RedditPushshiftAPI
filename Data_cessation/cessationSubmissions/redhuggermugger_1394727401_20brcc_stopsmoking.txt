17 Days! I feel absolutely amazing!

I know it hasn't been that long, but let me give some background. About five months ago, I was diagnosed with severe episodic migraines. I mean, these migraines would leave me crumpled on the bathroom floor, in a vomiting, crying, screaming mess. They suck balls.

So I was given a medication for them. The only stipulation, I couldn't take birth control, because this medication increases my chances of having a heart attack or stroke. But I just could not put the cigarettes down.  Being active duty, I'm constantly dealing with a shit storm, and I'm always a nervous ball of stress.

Two months ago, I started having heart palpitations and sharp pains in my chest. They did EKGs, ran tests, but couldn't find the culprit. It was pretty terrifying. So I made the only logical decision and I put the cigarettes down.

I feel so much better. My heart palpitations and chest pains have completely stopped. I can run 2 miles and not feel as winded, and I'm not coughing as much anymore. No more mucus coming up, nothing. 

I didn't realize the impact it had on my life and my health. And I'm extremely happy that I found this subreddit! Thanks for all of the motivation, guys!

Anyone else look up to Hitler to stop smoking?

I always watch this video along with many of his speeches. He just motivates me to stay strong and remain tobacco free. My favourite quote from him is "(tobacco) The wrath of the Red Man against the White Man, vengeance for having been given hard liquor".

Why look up to Hitler in particular? Because he was one of us. He was a nicotine addict too, in his early days in Vienna he smoked between 25 - 40 cigarettes a day. Then realised if he didn't waste his money on tobacco he could afford to put butter on his bread, so he quit smoking. The fact that a man would quit a 40 a day habit during a time when smoking was seen as perfectly normal and not unhealthy is unthinkable. He was the first to challenge big tobacco which led to the first link between cigarettes and lung cancer.

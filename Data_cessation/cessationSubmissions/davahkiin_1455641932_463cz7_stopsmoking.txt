I'm 19 and today is the day I quite smoking

Ive been smoking since I was 17, I picked it up for shits and giggles with my boy when we went to HS parties. Then I moved to Germany for university where it consolidated itself as a habit. It helped me make new friends, helped me get a girlfriend, and I moved in with roomates that smoked. 

Just yesterday I had a final for an incredibly difficult electrical engineering class which I had been studying weeks for. I was on the brink of my mental sanity preparing for this test and my habit really had been getting out of hand. As I got home last evening I had a mental breakdown. This really scared me because I'm very emotionally centered individual. I realized I had been losing it, everything I work so hard for would only be in vain if this habit remained a baseblock for my success. I failed the final, on my behalf it is an insanely difficult class and my german is still developing, i plan to retake it. So i'm done smoking.

Ive never had so much difficulty halting my habit for a week, couple days, even done it for months, but never imagined i would remain abstinent from it forever, but i think now's where it goes behind me.

But yea, I roll cigarettes by the way, and would smoke perhaps 10 every evening. Its difficult to admit my problem and like everyone else here i just would like some helpful comments and support. 
thanks for reading.

Been smoking since I was 12, 3 days clean.

So as the title says I had my first cigarette when I was 12 years old, and man it was hard, I had to actually work to get a puff down. Now I just turned 18 a couple weeks ago, and decided I'm not going to let these things control me anymore. Friday Sept 23rd 7am I had my last smoke, it's Monday Sept 26th 6:43am as of writing this. Yesterday I was able to go around my suburb 7 times without breaking a sweat! I usually could only go half of 1, and this morning I did 7 times around again, but this time I jogged half of one, and sprinted half of one. The worst part about this is that I felt the same that I did going up a flight of stairs just 4 days prior.

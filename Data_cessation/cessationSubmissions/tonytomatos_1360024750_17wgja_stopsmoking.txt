How I know I am winning

yesterday tested my will to stay done with smoking. I was at work and this guy started to scream at me for no reason whatsoever. I screamed back and this argument lasted a good 5 minutes. I normally would have gone outside for a smoke but instead went outside and did jumping jacks instead. errrrrr fuck that guy! but I did not smoke, fuck ya..... progress

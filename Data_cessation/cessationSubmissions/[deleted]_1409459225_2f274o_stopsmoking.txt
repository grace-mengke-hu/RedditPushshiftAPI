It's just one... right?

So I'm about a month tobacco free, been doing NRT (patch), and I'm drunk for the first time this month. My mom left a pack of cigs out on the table, and the craving is strong right now. I know I would hate myself in the morning, and they aren't even my brand. But I'm having a very hard time right now....

I hate not smoking but I'm doing it anyway and I just want to rant about how I hate not smoking

I was very happy announcing in early December that during my week off for Christmas I was going to kick the habit. No more smoking, I didn't have to work so no stress...I was happy to announce this with a cigarette in my mouth. 

The problem with quitting I realize is that I love smoking and I love smokers. I've always loved smoking. I never was one to moan that I needed to quit, not me. I hacked up my lung and lit up another without blinking. I just love smoking and I love hanging out with smokers. I've only dated smokers, makes it easier and most of my friends smoke. I like standing outside with them at a party smoking and talking. It's just nice. 

I did it though, I stopped smoking and every day I am super mad about it. I did it because my boyfriend wanted to stop, I did it because we need to save up to buy a car, I did it for my daughter who  always seems to have a cough and I know it's our fault so I did it for her. I hate not smoking, I resent the fact that there are people out there that get to smoke. I just want a cigarette! 

I hate not smoking. I am so freaking angry. I hate everyone and everything and Jesus I hate not smoking.

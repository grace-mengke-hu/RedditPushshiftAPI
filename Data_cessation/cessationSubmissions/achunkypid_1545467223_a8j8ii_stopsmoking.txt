Fuck guys I want a cigarette so bad and I hate it. (Day 3)

Hey guys, so this is my 3rd official time trying to quit smoking and boy has it been a doozy. I feel that this time has been way harder than the first time. The first time I had true motivations as to why I wanted to quit, but this time I feel like my heart truly isn't into it though my brain knows I need to.

 The first two days were really good since I've been distracted by my family which I am so happy to be with right now. However,  my uncle is also trying to quit and tonight we were drinking alot and the both of us were lamenting on how badly we wanted a cigarette and now it's hard to get it out of my head. I'm just so glad I came to visit my family in texas where I know it wouldn't be easy to just go to a store and pick up a pack of ciggies. The first time I quit I quit for about 3 months, then decided "oh I'm strong now, I can smoke a cigarette and I won't get hooked." Well...here we are. Picked up the habit again but realized what I was doing and am trying to stop. Nicotine is insane. It makes me feel so weak against it's urges.

I can hear it in my head telling me things like "Dude you're already so unhealthy, you might as well just keep the habit because it won't get better from here." or "3 days without a cigarette! you DESERVE a cigarette!" or even "Everyone smokes. Even the smartest people in the world smoke. Even a 100 year old grandma smokes. Is it even that bad..."

It's just so insane how these thoughts can be so pervasive. I guess that "Teenage" invincibility really does wean off once you hit your twenties.
  I just felt that I  needed to let this out to a community that understands this struggle.

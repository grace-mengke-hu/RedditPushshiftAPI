One month and I am feel like shit

Cold Turkey gobble gobble... Still lots of urges but I just say no, I am near places where I can buy cigarettes but have no problem not buying. I eat everything in site but what is worse is the shortness of breath - I have read that this is normal but please tell me it will get better. Oh and I smoked 30 cigarettes a day for almost 50 years although probably not 30 on my first day but there have been paarty days where I may have smoked 60...

You can do it, you just have to say no, the first week seems to have been the hardest

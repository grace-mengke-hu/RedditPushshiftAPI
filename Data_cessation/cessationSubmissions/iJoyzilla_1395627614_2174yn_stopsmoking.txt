Bad, bad craving, help!

I was fine this morning, not a problem, but now I am sitting here pacing around attempting not to give in to this craving. 

I was going to go out to the Library, to find some lit on quitting smoking (figured inspiration would be a good way to go), but then I realised that driving is another trigger, so I don't want to do that. 

I need to do something but I'm having a freaking anxiety attack and the internal conflict is making my brain implode on itself. :(

I have water, and gum. So I'm trying to use that to help, but now I am afraid of leaving the house, but inside isn't much better. Jeeeeeez guys, this sucks! :(

I quit using champix, and want to quit again. I have a heap of left over tablets..

Does anyone have any experience with knowing if you can cut champix in half? I know they're film coated but I wasn't sure if they were delayed release or not.

Otherwise I'll just start with the full dosage and tough it out. I didn't have any negative effects aside from some irritability the first time around.

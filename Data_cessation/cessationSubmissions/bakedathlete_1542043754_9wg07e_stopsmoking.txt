It’s been one week- when will I have my energy back?

I haven’t smoked in a week as I went on vacation for a couple days and didn’t have access. I decided not to buy more when I came home and have been doing okay craving-wise, I would smoke during specific times of the day and it’s only during those times where I think about them. I’ve gotten through the nausea and headaches for the most part, but have been pretty depressed. I used to be at the gym 6 days a week and haven’t gone at all since I got back. I miss my gym routine but I feel so blah both physically and mentally, feels right back to years ago when I was dealing with crippling depression. I feel like absolute shit and have been eating shit too which doesn’t help! 

I’ve done my research and I know it’s common to deal with fatigue after quitting. But I want my motivation and energy back! How long did it take you to get up and moving again? I feel like buying a pack just so I can have the energy to go to the gym which is ridiculous. I miss lifting but feel like I have the flu thanks to quitting. Any tips/stories are helpful, thank you :)

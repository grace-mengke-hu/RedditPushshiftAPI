Day 3! (Oh yeah, I think I need some new flair...)

I fell off the wagon last time.

I never stopped smoking spliffs when I quit cigarettes. Even though it's mixed with other stuff, I'm just as addicted to tobacco as I was before.

A few days ago I realized I needed out. I'm 24 years old - if I stop now, I will have a long, healthy, smoke-free life ahead of me!

Any suggestions for not giving into temptation? I still smoke, but I've given up tobacco for good.

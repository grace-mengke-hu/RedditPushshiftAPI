Spent the evening with smokers

So I finally hung out with the smokers tonight, and it was fine! I'm not going to just get new friends so I figured now that it's been 10 days I will see how it feels. When they all went outside I actually went out with them and used my 0% vape and it was great! I can't imagine I will need to use it much longer but it was nice for the party atmosphere. My friend talked my head off about how she wants to quit smoking. It's true.. we are in the enviable position of having escaped the nicotine trap!

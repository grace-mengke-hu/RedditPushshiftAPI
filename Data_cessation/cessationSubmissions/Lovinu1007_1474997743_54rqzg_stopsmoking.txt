5 days and lots of mucus

I quit cold turkey after approx 6 years of smoking..maximum 5 cigarettes per day. Today is the fifth day, it's going fairly well apart one thing : I'm rejecting lots of mucus and my throat is quite itchy. Is it due to stop smoking or am I just sick? Also my hands and toes have turned really warm and red after quitting. Any idea why?

What worked and why

Hallo fellow quitters (or soon to be!)! The app I use to help me quit suggests I write a list of the things that helped me through these early days and why. So here it goes!

Strong flavoured tea or coffee & snacks - obviously to taste and smell something

Phone app - to see what I have accomplished so far and take pride in myself

Internet - to read about health benefits, nicotine addiction and information about smoking in general (if you can't stop thinking about it, at least learn something that strengthens your willpower!)

Reddit - find courage in others, get help and inspiration (thank you all!)

Also on days 2 and 3 what really helped me was cleaning and tidying up closets, bookshelves etc. to keep my mind and hands busy.

There it goes! Hope it helps some of you! Let's keep not smoking!

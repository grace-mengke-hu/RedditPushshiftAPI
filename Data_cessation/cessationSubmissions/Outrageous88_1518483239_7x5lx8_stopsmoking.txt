I forgot to post at my 6 month mark

There are days that I don't think about smoking at all. I will not go back, quitting was the best thing I have done for myself. 

It created a ripple effect, I have since quit drinking as much, hardly at all any more, but when I do, I don't crave a smoke. I started eating better and exercising regularly. 

I live with an indoor smoker as well, so if I can do it, anyone can.

Allen Carr's book helped me tremendously, he really made something change in my head to where I actually *wanted* to quit, and that my friends, made all the difference.

Keep at it!

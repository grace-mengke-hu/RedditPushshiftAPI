Giving it up today.

It took me a while to come up with the courage after finding this subreddit. I have been a smoker for 10 years. After finally not enjoying it anylonger, it's time. I will post as the progress goes on. Gotta love doing it not just for you, but for your family too.  2 hours in already. It feels good.

Ok im quitting...but I have a question about e-cigs.

Im trying to quit but I have an e-cig for when im drinking with friends.  Basically im thinking that when im buzzing im much more likely to say fuck it and start smoking.  But since I have the e-cig I think I'll probably go for that instead.  Is this a good plan?

Woke up completely disgusted with myself

Last night I went to a party. One friend, who quit around the same time I did, was smoking an e-cigarette right in my face the whole night. Another friend, who still hasn't even thought about quitting, was really interested in the e-cig. I tried to ignore it completely because I know if I let even just a little bit of nicotine back in I'll be right back to two packs a day by the end of the week.

I got kind of hammered at the party, got a ride home from a smoker, and collapsed into bed. I dreamed that I was still at the party and I was smoking that e-cig, and from there just bumming smokes from people. It was really realistic dream. I got up and my clothes from the night before smelled like cigarettes. I was so disappointed and disgusted with myself I nearly puked.

I texted the friend who gave me a ride. "I can't believe I was smoking last night!" She wrote back, "What?! When?" From there we worked out that I never touched any of it and unless I was puffing away at home I was still a quitter. * whew * 

112 days. I can hardly believe it. A year ago I was hawking my TV so I could afford cigarettes (and choosing to just buy more cigarettes instead of buying food with that money). Now I'm sick to my stomach at the idea of lighting up. I never thought I'd see the day!

End of rant!

**Edit** posted this when I was hungover/still drunk and forgot all about it. Thanks for all the encouragement. I only mentioned hawking the TV so people who are on the fence about quitting and using "But you don't understand how much I love smoking!" can see that there is someone out there who loved it more and even that fool was able to quit.

2 months, still depressed

I am having a super hard time this week sticking with quitting.  I was okay for the first 1-2 weeks, while I was on vacation, but when I got home it got infinitely worse.  I have a history of depression and have used smoking as a way to cope with my eating disorder.  For weeks 3-4 I had incredible depression, anxiety and anger.  For days I just laid on the floor of my bedroom wanting to kill myself but knowing that it was just the lies of addiction.  I kicked a hole in the wall of my bathroom and thought I was going to go back to smoking.  At week 5 I had to drop out of my summer classes at university because I couldn't cope with the anxiety I was having in order to get my homework done.  I would sit through my classes but just couldn't focus on reading.  My eating disorder has been a constant problem since quitting and has been really bad this week, causing me to want to go back.  But I know its all just lies.  It has been getting better looking back at it, but I have no idea how I even went through all that and am really craving some fucking cigarettes.  I'm having a hard time visualizing how my life is going to get better.  I am hoping to go back to university in the fall, but I'm just super nervous that I won't be able to handle it again and will have to drop out.  I am seeing a therapist and what not, just trying to get to the next day and hope that it gets keeps getting better.

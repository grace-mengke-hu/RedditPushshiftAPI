Big set backs.

A few months ago I started smoking black and milds. I started working nights at a bar on top my main job. 20 hour days mixed with a bar full of smoke made it rough. I started hitting a black and mild here and there. I don't work at the bar anymore but here i am a few months later and I can't tell you when I started smoking a pack of blacks a day. I saw an old childhood friend the other day. He is almost a year clean of a serious drug addiction. I didn't know he was also 7 months smoke free. I was blown away when he said that cause he always said he never wanted to stop. It hit me real hard that I've completely back tracked and he is living free. Well, since I woke up yesterday I haven't had a puff. He really inspired me and made me feel bad. Here's to quitting. I'm on mobile and don't know how to reset my flair.

First smoke-free travel: check

Spending two days in Padua.
It is the first time I leave my hometown since quitting: so far, so good.

Update: the pullman stopped for ten minutes on the way back. A wall of people elbowed and cursed its way out for a quick smoke: I never thought I used to look so desperate throughout most of my adult life.
I got out too, but for my stretching routine.
It felt good **not to have to do something**.

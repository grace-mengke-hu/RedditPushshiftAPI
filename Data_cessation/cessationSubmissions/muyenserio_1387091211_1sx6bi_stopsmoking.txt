Guys, I'm quitting on Monday.

I'm quitting on Monday. Do you have any advice that might be helpful down the road? 

Thank you

**EDIT: Taken from your responses, I'll:**

* Stay calm
* Remember each disgusting cigarrete filter each time I get cravings.
* Remember that cravings last 5 minutes on average and then pass.
* Get a copy of Allen Carr's book.

**As per /u/laurahrahrah 's suggestion, here's my list of things I hate about smoking:**

* It makes me as unfit as an old man. 
* It limits me when I want to do more sports or become more healthy.
* I smell bad all the time.
* I always need a fix. 
* It makes me look weak and vicious. 
* It's making permanent damage to my body. 

**While reading Allen Carr's book, I've found some gems I wish to store here:**
> It is basically fear that keeps us smoking: the fear that life can never be quite as enjoyable without cigarettes, and the fear of feeling deprived.

Just quit

Don't have anyone IRL to inform, so I'm posting it here. Not really a longterm speaker (i've been smoking for about 8 months) but I really ended up realizing that it was serving as a crutch and that it was really preventing me from enjoying my life. Have some edibles that I'm gonna use to help me along the way when I really need a substance. Wish me luck.

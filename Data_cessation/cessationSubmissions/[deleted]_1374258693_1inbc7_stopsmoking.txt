It's a lot harder then I anticipate

I first started smoking since I was ten years old. It was on and off mostly, well due to my mother. Move in with my grandparents at fifth teen, start smoking everyday, It was very easy for me to get smokes cause of my Uncle,Uncle (By marriage),auntie, my aunties girlfriend. And of coarse my friends at high-school. I got into an Argo accident the ninth of February this year. I had an internal fracture and...I was told by the Doctors that I was very lucky to just have that, when it could've been a lot worse. So all is fine then sometime in March I believe I stared to lose my smell,and my taste. Well not literally lose it, I can still smell certain stuff, and taste certain stuff, like Vanilla I can taste it. But since then I've been having problems like that. And It's only getting worse. ANY WHO! Just recently do these problems start to affect my smoking, Just recently like two maybe three days ago cigarets start to taste really really nasty, and I've been trying to quit since Wednesday. And I just can't, well I can but its starting to get harder everyday.

TLDR: I've been smoking since I was ten years old, I'm now seventeen years old. But it's getting harder very day. I can't smell or taste certain things but cigerats taste very nasty now. I just want to quit and better my self. Thank you.

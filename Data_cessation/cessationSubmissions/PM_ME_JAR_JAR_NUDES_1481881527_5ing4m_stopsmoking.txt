Day... Three? I think? Cravings are stopping. Just fighting the habit now.

The first day was terrible. Blinding headaches, ears fully plugged up and head fit to burst. Couldn't speak because my throat was half swelled shut and my sinuses were screaming from the pressure. Jitters and flash-fits of anger kept me from sleeping. Managed to make it on maybe a half-dozen nicotine lozenges, but my throat hurt so bad I could barely swallow anyway.

Second day was a little better. Only ate two nicotine lozenges the whole day. Throat was only a little sore. Kept getting out of my desk and trying to go outside to smoke before catching myself in a loop though. Cravings were strongest at the end of day 2, so I just went to bed after a hot shower.

Third day has been okay. I woke up hacking up tar and phlegm, took a shower, blew out my nose and let the steam clear up my head a bit, and after I got out of the shower it's been okay since.

Noticed a bit of irritability, but I think the worst of it is over. I haven't had a proper craving for a cigarette yet. Though, I have noticed that when I cook, I tend to not know what to do or how to time things anymore, because cooking and smoking was a heavily linked set of activities for me.

Definitely noticing that my focus and clarity is down though. Does that get better over time, or is that just my new maximum level of focus thanks to a lack of stimulants?

Last pack, 8 left. Im terrified.

I am afraid of the withdrawal. And as stupid as it may sound, im afraid of what people are gonna say if i cant manage to quit.
I've tried quitting before. But after 2 months i gave up, thought if i just lasted long enough it would get better. Honestly it did not feel like it got any better, just "worse" in a way, because i expected it to be easier and easier to endure...

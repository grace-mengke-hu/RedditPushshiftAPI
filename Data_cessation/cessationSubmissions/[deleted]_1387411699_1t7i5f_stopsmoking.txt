Made it 18 hours....

I made it almost a full day then lost it and bummed a smoke from one of my classmates before my exam.... DAMN... oh well, I'm an hour in now again and Im going to try again. I just need this out of my life, I know its bringing me down, If i can get through the first 24 I know ill be in the clear from the past experiences i have had. So here we go. Im staying up late tonight working on some mixes for school and studying for my exams so ill be checking back with this sub quite a bit tonight. I know i have the strength to do this.

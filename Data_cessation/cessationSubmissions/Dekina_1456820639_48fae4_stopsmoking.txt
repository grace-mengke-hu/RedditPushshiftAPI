What the hell do you do, with all the time?

So, I have been without cigarettes for 26 days, and 4 days without my vapor-thing.

The nicotine withdrawals are not all that pleasant, the headache, the stuffy nose, the tightness in the chest, but it's nothing worse than a mild hangover. Also the fact that you can FEEL your body recovering, is sort of amazing. The itching skin and tongue is slightly more annoying, but again, I am picturing myself as Mother Gothel, singing to a stupid flower. ;)

My great big problem, is what to do with the time I have gotten back. It is easy when I spend time with others, mainly because most of my close friends are non-smokers, but when I'm alone, it gets really hard. It was not a problem when I had the vapor, because substitute and all, but now I just feel like I am wasting time? It's a little hard to explain the exact feeling. I just don't know what to do.

Having morning coffee, after breakfast, when whatever I'm baking is in the oven, waiting for a game to download, all these little things, where I would otherwise have occupied myself with either the vapor or a cigarette. I have, when it gets really bad, resorted to masturbating, but let us be honest here. That is not really a socially acceptable substitute. "Great Mom, dinner was awesome, let me just go an rub one out." No. Just, no. It releases endorphines and dopamine, it relaxes the muscles, relieves headaches, all these wonderful things, but no. It's a no.

I also don't really want to use a substitute. It replaces one habit with another, I was just wondering if anyone out there had some technique, that was maybe more socially acceptable than mine? I find myself just sitting and watching the clock, checking when I would be back if I had a cigarette, and then go back to doing things. Complete waste of time.

Quitting Before I'm Legal

I've been smoking since I was 15. I'm 17 now. It's been a pretty serious addiction that I tried to use a vapor pen to break. No avail. And I am having a lot of anxiety and cravings. Today is my 1st full day of not having a cigarette. I haven't gone a full day in I don't know how long.

I get through it by doing the following

1. I don't think or allow my friends to say the word cigarette around me.

2. I run and exercise. And do push ups. And yell. 

That's it. Good luck to people who have smoked a lot longer then me and keep going like I will. Thanks!

The most dangerous cigarette of all is the one you think is okay to have because of a false illusion of not being any smoker anymore, you think you can handle one puff/cig.

[Look at this highly unscientific graph](http://i.imgur.com/FFhmI4T.png). I just had an epiphany that no matter how long you've been smoke free, the road from one puff, to one cig, to one pack to being full time smoker is **equally** short. Do you agree?

I have quit smoking before and failed. At one time for six whole months.

Of all the times I've failed it has been because of that ONE cigarette. One puff even. At a party, being drunk, being with smoker friends, whatever. I've managed to fool myself into thinking "I'm not a smoker anymore, let me enjoy this one cig". The next thing you know, you ask for more cigs from your friends. Eventually they get tired of you and you get your own pack, "but just for the evening, you'll throw it away after the party". Right. You're stuck for life.

**TL;DR:** Do not fool yourself. That one puff/cig that you think is so innocent, is the most dangerous of all, and is essentially what will cause your relapse.

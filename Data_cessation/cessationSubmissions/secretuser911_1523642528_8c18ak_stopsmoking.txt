Day 7: Mentally Well, Physically Broken

Alright. Day seven and no cravings or emotional instability. (Day 5 was the worst for me) 

However, my body feels like it’s going through the wringer. I’ve developed a small cough and sore throat. My energy levels have been through the roof on some days but the past two day I’ve felt achy and tired. 

Also not smoking messed up my stomach very badly. I have not been regular and now the left side of my stomach hurts when I breathe and move. (I did do a small workout yesterday so maybe I pulled something but it feels more intestinal and due to bloating/not being regular). 

Still very happy with my choice. Glad the mental anguish has subsided, just need to lay back and physically recover. 

Edit: just wanted to add that I am slowly losing weight this quit. When I quit before a few years ago eating sweets was the only thing that made me happy so I gained. But this time my stomachs been such a mess I can hardly eat at all.

How long before you felt better? I know it’s different for everyone

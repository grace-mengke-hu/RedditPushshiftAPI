Hopefully this is the last attempt at quitting

Hello Reddit, 
Last night I had my last cig around 8pm or so. I went to bed, got up and went to work as usual. I am about 6 hours deep with no smoke and I am having some anxiety right now. Let me tell you just a little about my smoking career: I am currently 32 years old. I started when I was only 10. (Back then cigs only cost $2.25 for name brand smokes) I have quit from time to time, the most at one time would be about 2 years. I would say from the time that I was 10 until currently, I have smoked about 19 of those years. When I was younger, I would easily burn through a pack in a day. Up until yesterday, I average anywhere from5-10 cigs in a day, depending on how my day goes. I had my first child back in January of 2017 and immediately wanted to quit smoking and drinking. – Right now, I am just focusing on smoking – Next will be drinking. I digress. The main reason (aside from despising cigarettes for their cost and their toll on your body) was a definitive moment the other day: My wife asked me to ‘pop’ her back in. She crossed her arms over her chest, I grabbed her from behind and lifted her up while extending backwards. Immediately, it almost felt like something popped in me as well. My heart felt like it was being stabbed, kind of like you see in movies when someone is stabbing voodoo dolls in the heart. I panicked for a couple minutes there. On a side note, my breaths have been getting gradually shorter over time and I would occasionally feel sharps pains in my heart. I have been meaning to get this checked out, but have been dreading the results. Fact of the matter is, this attempt at quitting needs to be my last, or else I may never quit at all, which wont end well. Any advice on the matter would be appreciated. Thanks!

TL:DR – Been smoking most of my life and now its taking its toll on my health. I also have a kid now and I need to quit.

It's Been Almost A Month

With the help of my eGo-T e-cigarette I haven't smoked a real cigarette in almost a month. My lung capacity has already gotten better and there has been zero temptation to smoke. My fiance still smokes and honestly the smell repulses me. I wish he'd quit too. On the downside, I've gained about 8 lbs. I'd rather be chubby than smoke though. Sick of it! After multiple failed quitting attempts, I am focused and determined.

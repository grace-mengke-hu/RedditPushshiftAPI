Waking up in the middle of the night wanting a smoke!!

What the hell is wrong with me??? It’s 1am and I’m wanting a cig really bad. I’m 16days quit and this makes me mad. 
Woke up and my mind was wandering and thought about how an acquaintance kinda dissed me yesterday . It just occurred to me that it happened and now it’s  too late to respond or let them know I know what they did. See this is just the kind of thing that will make me smoke again. When I get pissed off because someone treats me like shit. Why I in turn want to treat myself like shit by smoking makes no sense either. It’s a good thing that I don’t have any in the house. This is exactly what I am scared of. This guy is just a casual friend, what’s going to happen when it’s someone that matters to me that hurts me? I’ll want to smoke a half of a pack. Shit! I hate this!
It’s 1:30 am... I can’t go take a walk or go to the gym until this passes. I need strength.

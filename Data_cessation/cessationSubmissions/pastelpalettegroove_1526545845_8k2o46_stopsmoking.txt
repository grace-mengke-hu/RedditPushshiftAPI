Tips on quitting social smoking

Hi guys,

I have been smoking seriously for about 4 years when I decided to stop last June. Over time, I made the mistake to reintroduce smoking when I go out with friends who are smokers.

Whilst I never crave cigarettes sober, away from social settings, and have never been even tempted to return to my daily habit, being 23 means I allowed myself cigarettes at least once or twice a week when I go out, enough of it to still make me feel some of the annoying consequences. 

It is very clear for me that my cigarette consumption has little to do to a classical addiction (I wouldn't even think of smoking on a daily basis, and can go weeks without doing so if I am not going out), but rather connected to social cues.

My question is: how would someone in my situation break this habit? I have made some progress lately, but I would love to hear your tips!

Thank you and good luck to everyone on the journey

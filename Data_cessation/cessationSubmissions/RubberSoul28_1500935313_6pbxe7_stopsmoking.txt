Quit for 40 days, went back, uvula is fucked

I smoked for about a year or so, then quit due to a problem with my uvula (I think). I'm not even entirely sure that it's the uvula, but i think it's kinda swollen and has been since I started up again. Anyone else experience this? It just feels like there's something caught in my throat, isn't that painful, but just really kind of irritating.

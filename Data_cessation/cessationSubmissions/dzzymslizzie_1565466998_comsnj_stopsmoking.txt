Feeling hopeless and furious with myself over relapse.

Generally have kicked the habit during the day, during the week. But in social situations the wheels come off. Smoked half a pack last night. I love my Friday happy hours with cold beer in the summertime and don’t want to have to avoid them but maybe I do? That said, it’s not realistic to stay away forever. How am I ever going to do this? 

Now the damn clocks starts over, ugh. This has got to be my 50th “day 1” and it just feels hopeless.

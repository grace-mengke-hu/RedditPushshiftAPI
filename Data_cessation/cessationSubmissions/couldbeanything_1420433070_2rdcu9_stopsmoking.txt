Over 2 Months Nicotine Free!

I haven't had a cigarette in 63 days.  I feel like a champion.

I just got dumped.
I live with my ex.
I need to find a new apartment.
I'm in debt.
I'm not making enough money.
I have no friends here.

But I can deal with all of those problems.  They can't be as hard as quitting! Bring it.

Seriously, it's a HUGE source of pride and confidence.  I'm feeling pretty good about things.  Not only did I quit, but I didn't use all those shitty things as excuses to start smoking again. In the past, I definitely would have.

I'm also thinking about getting healthier in other ways.  Starting the /r/bodyweightfitness program, and I'm gonna cut back on the junk food.  And I know I can stick to those if I choose to. Again, not as hard as quitting!

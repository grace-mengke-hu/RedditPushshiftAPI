Question on feelings

Hi guys 
Now I am in a situation in which I alternate one day smoke free and one day in which I smoke 3-4 cigs .
And I feel shitty in terms of fatigue, brain fog, sadness.

Could it be related to the fact that I break the abstinence in a periodic way? (One day smoke-one day no smoke)

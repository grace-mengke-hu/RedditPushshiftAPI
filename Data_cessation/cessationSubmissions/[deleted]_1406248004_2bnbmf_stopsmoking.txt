Last cigarette 1/7/2014, quit with 2 friends in January.

One friend caved last Friday, and she is on a bender, back to a pack a day. the other friend is still chewing 10 pieces of 2mg gum/day. I'm having a hard time saying no. Under a ton of stress, after my therapy session all I want to do is smoke. i started smoking in 2002, quit in 2010, had a 4 month relapse in 2013 and quit again in jan 2014. damn this monkey! The only thing keeping me from smoking again is that it's a bitch to quit. I know I can't be moderate with the cigs. I take b-125 vitamins and niacin already. I just want to numb out.

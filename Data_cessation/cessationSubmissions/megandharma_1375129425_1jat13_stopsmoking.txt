I have one cigarette left in my pack. I'm hoping it will be my last one.

I've been smoking for 7 years. I've quit a few times; did quite well for a number of months, but fell right back down for one excuse after another.

I have been talking about quitting for a number of weeks, and after reading inspirational stories by this community I think I'm going to try again.

In the past when I quit, I did it cold turkey and really didn't experience too many side effects other than feeling fatigued for a few days. So I'm going to smoke this last one and start again.

If for some reason cold turkey doesn't work for me this time around, does anyone have any recommendations to look into in the future?

Wish me luck. :)

I need help guys

I was planning on quitting for a while now, lungaches, bad breathes, less capacity of physical stuff etc. On 15th of June, i decided to drop it as whole. But couldn't make it and smoked 4 of them, the whole day. It was actually a nice decrease from 2 packs a day, but i thought i should stop completely. Now today, i bought a pack of nicotine gums and it helped me throughout the day. It became more of a bending the rule rather than craving. Smoked one half an hour ago, which was a failure on my side, i instantly regret it. Thanks to the gums, i don't crave it or have any breakdowns and stuff despite 7 years of smoking, but how can i beat the "meh, one wouldn't hurt" idea? I guess i cant see the line clearly, between not smoking and smoking only one a day, it actually feels harmless. I know its not, but... yeah. I need help about it.

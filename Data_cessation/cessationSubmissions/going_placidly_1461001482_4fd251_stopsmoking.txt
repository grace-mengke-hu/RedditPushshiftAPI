DAY 1 after 26 Years – COLD TURKEY

Hi Guys,
Newcomer here! After 26 years I've finally made a commitment to never take another puff. I've attempted to quit several times in the past, always using NRPs and never truly giving it up. (allowing myself smoke here and there as a reward + while drinking. I love beer and the two are synonymous for me. The beer too is taking a back seat for a while) Anyway, I used to be a pack-pack 1/2 a day smoker and after my last quit attempt brought that number down to no more than 10 a day. Sometimes as few as 3 a day. I started seeing a cessation therapist last week and I've gathered a lot of literature and joined a few online forums. Joel Spitzers WHY QUIT? videos have been really helpful in gearing me up and I started reading Allen Carrs "Easy Way to Stop Smoking" I feel really good about this. More confident than before as I feel more equipped with the necessary tools. Thats It. Good luck to everyone just starting and also to those with some time under their belts. I'll keep you posted…


EDIT: Wow! The support in this sub is unparalleled. Thanks everyone. Onto day 2!

Giving Back!

I was working on a Cardiac ward the past couple of weeks and I came across a patient that had just quit smoking. She, like me, had to quit. No planning, no preparation. I was given the opportunity to share what you guys have shared with me. Quickly in the few minutes I had with her, I was able to relay all the info I could think of that I'd learned here to get her on her way. This site, Allen Carr, Phone App, diet advice.  It was a good feeling. We are doing really good work here friends! :))

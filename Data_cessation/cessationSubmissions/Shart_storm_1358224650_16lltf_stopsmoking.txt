So, you guys are here to help???

I'm 24 years old, I've been a smoker since I was 15, I have been toying with the idea that I CAN quit, but I'm scared of the attitude problems I always have. I don't want to bring negativity to the table in my daily interactions wherever I go, but I can't just keep going on smoking like this because of that, or because the girl I'm crushing on is a smoker and the only time I really get to spend alone with her is on our cigarette breaks. 

I've been toying with the idea all day today, that I can not smoke for JUST ONE DAY, and after that one day I might be able to do it again. Keeping it simple and in the day has worked for other things in the past for me, and I really feel like it's time to try to quite again. Lo and behold I stumble upon this reddit in just that kind of mood.

I'm tired of having chronic bronchitis, I'm tired of being broke more times than not, I'm tired of smelling weird and having yellow finger tips, I'm tired of burn holes in fabric, I'm tired of not getting the most out of my body. I'm tired of worrying that I'm going to end up like my mother and father and grandmother (grandmother died of emphysema, father died of heart disease, mother currently has emphysema and is on disability, still smoke too.........)

I don't want to be sick and dead before my time, I want to be the best me I can be, and I want freedom from such a disgusting silly wasteful crutch that doesn't even help, it only prolongs your problem. A smoke doesn't calm you down, it only bottles up what you are feeling and it gets worse over time.

I don't just want help, I NEED help, and I am no longer too proud to admit that. My life is worth far more than my ego.

Do I have Ya'lls support???

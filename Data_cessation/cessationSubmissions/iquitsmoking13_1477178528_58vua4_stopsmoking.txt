Sore throat.. anxious about health. too much so?

OK so I quit smoking about a months ago. I am 24 years old, bit am having a lot of anxiety about my throat specifically.

A year or maybe 2 years ago i started noticing this persistent "feeling" in my -lower- throat. Not the part near the mouth, moreso just above the upper sternum. Not sure what exactly it is called. below the adams apple though.

Anyways is this common for smoker to have a weird feeling there? Hard to call it pain but definitely discomfort. I DID get it checkmed out by a doctor when i was still smoking they put a camera down my throat and said it looks inflamed from smoking but nothing immediately serious.  I am just worried if i have or will have cancer :( I am only 24 i dont want to die just yet!! Can still feel the feeling there even though its been a month smoke free.

Anyone with throat issues who still smoke or have quit can u please share experiences? Details on specific areas and symptoms etcv..

Like I say i hope not cancer dont want to die young, I think i will ask my doctor to send me for another endoscopy because i cant stop thinking about it. I hope it is just damaged that can be repaired somewhat. AHHH sorry for messy typing.

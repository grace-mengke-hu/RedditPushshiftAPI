hate myself for failing so many times...really waant to quit

Hello there. I have so many attempts at quitting, that it is hard to count. Have had many days of nonsmoking only to start smoking again at the first going out or the first anxiety event.

I am a very neurotic person and deal with anxiety or high emotional states by addiction. I think for me it is impossible to quit unless I also learn how to relax and self-soothe.
For me smoking is also a very social activity. Most of my friends smoke and it is a chance to catch up with the and have a chat over a cig.
Since I am a light smoker my biggest risk is the thought in my head "well its just one cigarette" and then I fall off the wagon.
I want to kick this fucking addiction once and for all, which means
But here I am again giving it another go. I need inner srength, that I somehow do not have. Due to quitting and restarting so many times I have somehow also lost faith in my abilities to stick to it. 
Will write a lot to begin with Just to make sure I am sticking to it.

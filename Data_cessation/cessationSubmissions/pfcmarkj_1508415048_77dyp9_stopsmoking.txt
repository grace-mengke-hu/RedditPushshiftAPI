Day 3

Hey all I'm new here. 24 yo smoking for about 7 years or so about a pack a day. I just got over a really bad case of the flu and when I went to the hospital the Dr asked "do you smoke? First thing after I mentioned my symptoms and thought to myself oh my, I need to stop. So I have and it's been 3 days. Now granted I've been sick for that time and haven't left my apartment. When does it get easier?

42 days smoke free, first post

At the age of 35, after almost 20 years of a smoking habit which had got to over 20 a day, I smoked my last cigarette 42 days ago. I have tried several times over the years, using many different methods, and failed after a day or so (and then lied to friends and family).
This time I've cracked it - I know I have. I read EasyWay and it was as easy as the name suggests.
If anything, it has been a bit of an anticlimax, and I almost feel like I was never real smoker in the first place! Nothing would make me smoke another cigarette.
Incidentally... I chose the most stressful and difficult time of my life so-far to quit, and I wonder if the fact that my routine has changed anyway has helped. 
I realise that my quoting journey is not over but (despite my original opinion) I am now a great advocate of Alan Carr's methods.
I am just so excited for the future!!

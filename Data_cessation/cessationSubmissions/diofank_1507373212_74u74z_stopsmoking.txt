Quitter's flu, feeling so lame

I've been smoke free for a week now and I guess the quitter's flu gas hit me. I feel feverish but my temperature is normal, keep waking up in the middle of the night bc of a sore throat, my nose is running nd I feel a cough coming my way.... 

Those of you who've had this, how long did it last?

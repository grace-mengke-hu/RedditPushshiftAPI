You know what feels awesome? Feeling proud of yourself.

Aw man… I'm so proud of myself right now. You know what I haven't felt in over a decade? Pride. Pride in myself. I've only been smoke free for a week, but tonight was the first night I went out socially with my friends who smoke. I didn't smoke at all. It was uncomfortable for a little bit, but the more I sat there and watched them smoke, the more I remembered why I wanted to quit. Everyone was so stressed out, sucking cigarettes for comfort. And there I was sitting back feeling good for the first time in over a decade just watching them puff away, lighting smoke after smoke. I sat there thinking "damn, is that what I was like?" It really was hard for a little bit, but the more I observed, the more comfortable I felt in deciding to quit. It's hard, but it's a good kind of hard. Like I said, it's that feeling of pride you get that trumps everything else. You're just like "yeah, I fucking quit. I'm done with this." You realize that your life is your own. What other people choose to do is their own business. If you have dreams, fucking go get that shit. If you have friends that don't give a fuck, well… fuck them. Take control of your life. Quit smoking and go out there and achieve your dreams. It takes energy to make shit happen in your life, and smoking robs you of that energy. So fuck smoking. Get out there and make shit happen. Much love to all of you, my brothers and sisters.

Finally quitting cigarettes!

Hi guys,

So I've been a smoker for about 4 years, and today I've finally made the decision to quit. For the past few months I've been working on my discipline and changing some bad habits. Today I think I'm ready to begin my triple-journey, I'm quitting cigarettes, weed, and coke/sugar all together! I just thought it might be a good idea to share this with a community who is familiar with what I'm going through. Any advice you guys can offer is appreciated, and I will absolutely anything it takes to stick to my plan. Thanks for your time!

It's my 6th day and I feel this is it, I don't feel like smoking. Although I am getting angry at the stupidest things.

I am not an angry type, I actually very rarely get angry at things. But past 2 days have been weird. I am getting angry at the silliest things. Things like a movie trailer that just got released and I don't like it so I start ranting about it and then I realize I have never been like this before. So is this normal for quitters to get angry? I am quitting after 8 years of smoking. I have been smoking pack (10 cigs) a day for past 3 years now and I am 29.

So yeah is this normal? Any way to get around this or just wait for this to phase out?

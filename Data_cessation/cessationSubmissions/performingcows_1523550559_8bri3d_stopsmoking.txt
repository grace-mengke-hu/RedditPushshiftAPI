10 days and feeling good!

I know I still have a long way to go, but still some encouragement for everyone who has just quit: I have posted here before about terrible cravings - hasn't happened in days, my digestion has become normal again and my skin (which was horrible right after quitting) has cleared up. Can't say anything about the breathing right now since i have a cold (not quitters flu but regular cold) but I bet it would be worse if I was still smoking.
All in all, it gets a lot better very soon.

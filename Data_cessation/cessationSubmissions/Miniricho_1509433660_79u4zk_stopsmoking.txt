Day two.

Well, two days into my quit, using the easyway method, and my girlfriend of over two years decides to break up with me. Says it has nothing to do with the not smoking and that she's been unhappy for months. 

I'm on the edge man, it's taking every fibre of my being not to;

-Headbutt a wall until death.

-Drive to buy cigarettes. 

Any tips/pointers appreciated!

Day 25 - Cravings still suck, but I'm still here.

I kinda don't know how to feel. I'm struggling with all kinds of thoughts, and just trying to ignore them for the most part. I'll give you an example of one kind of thought that runs through me my mind:

"Look, the cravings are not really getting that much better. 25 days, and you're still obsessing. You still have trouble even picturing certain situations without wanting to smoke. So...you must not really WANT to stop smoking. And if that's true, then this attempt to quit is not going to work. Just admit that you don't really want this, and go back to smoking until you get to the point where you're really ready to stop". 

As I said, I'm sort of just...watching these thoughts, and trying really hard not to connect with them. 

Anyone else have these?

Thanks as always to all of you who read/respond (or just read and don't respond!). It helps a lot. 

EDIT: I say this with all due respect, and forgive me if I sound like an asshole, but: please don't tell me to read Alan Carr. For two reasons: 1. I have already read Alan Carr, and found that the approach did not really connect with my experience and 2. I am not really looking for a way to "kill" these thoughts...just looking for a place to share them and to receive feedback from others who identify with them. Thanks!

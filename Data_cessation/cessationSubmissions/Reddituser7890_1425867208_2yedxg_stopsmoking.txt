Two months smoke-free and lungs still feel heavy.

The title pretty much sums it up. At my worst I was smoking about a half a pack or less per day and did so for about 8 years. I quit smoking January 3rd and haven't touched a cigarette since but I can't quite get the full deep breath that I so strongly desire. In that time I took up running and after about half a mile, my lungs burn the same as when I had tried running as a smoker. It's obviously not nearly as bad as when I was a smoker but I can't help but think my lungs should be healing faster then this. Maybe I should see a specialist but before that I wanted to see if this has been anyone else's experience.

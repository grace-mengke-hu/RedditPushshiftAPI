I feel like I have no will-power.

Does anybody else have a problem where they can quit buying cigarettes, but keep bumming them when opportune? I "quit" but I smoked four cigarettes today because I was offered, and because I was bored. I feel like I'm being a mooch and I'm failing simultaneously. When I'm bored and I see someone smoking, I ask. Or rather I have. What do I do? Thoughts?

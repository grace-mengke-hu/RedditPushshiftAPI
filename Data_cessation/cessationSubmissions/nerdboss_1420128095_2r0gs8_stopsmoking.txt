Thank you, r/stopsmoking!

One year ago, nearly to the minute, I embarked on my fourth serious quit attempt. I had previously tried wellbutrin, NRT, and chantix, all with predictable results. This time was different: I was informed and prepared. Allen Carr and this sub had destroyed all of my illusions and excuses for smoking, and there really is something about that badge. Again, thank you all so much for the information and support.

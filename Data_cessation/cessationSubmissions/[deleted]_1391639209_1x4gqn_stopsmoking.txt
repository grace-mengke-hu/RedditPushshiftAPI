I'm a teacher - we had kids who were caught smoking in the washroom a few days ago. I'd like to open a Google video chat with someone who has lung cancer due to smoking, or any other disease. Any one up for this?

Hey Reddit,

I'm a teacher in Toronto, ON.  These kids are in Grade 8. I was thinking about having them run a No Smoker campaign at our school but I'd like them to speak to someone who is suffering due to this raging addiction.

Would anyone be willing to speak on Google Hangouts with us?

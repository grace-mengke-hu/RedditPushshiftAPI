I want to quit, but I enjoy smoking and almost want to keep with it.

So for the past month or so, I have been smoking almost exactly 3 a day (the odd occasion id have four or five, sometimes more of I'm drinking). I really do want to quit to save money, and obviously I'm aware of the health risks, but I also enjoy smoking, and it became part of my routine when I was just having 3 a day. 

Anyone have any ideas on how to change my mindset to not wanting cigarettes in general?

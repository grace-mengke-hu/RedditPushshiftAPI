Unexpected severity of withdrawal symptoms

Hi,

I [28M] have smoked 7 cigarettes a day on average for 4 years, have been smoke free for 10 days, and have never tried quitting before. Before quitting, I read several articles on what to expect in order to be prepared but my experience so far has been pleasantly surprising compared to my expectations. 

Experienced symptoms so far: 1) Very mild cravings for smoking, 2) Shortness of breath sometimes (read that it is normal because lungs are cleaning themselves), and 3) flu like symptoms, and coughing in the morning only.

Anyone else had a similar experience? Is this normal for some people or the actual symptoms are going to hit me all of sudden any day now? 

Any insight would be really appreciated. Thank you.

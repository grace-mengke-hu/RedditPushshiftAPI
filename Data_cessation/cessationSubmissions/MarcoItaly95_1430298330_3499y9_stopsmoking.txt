Day 10. Feel so good

I feel very satisfied with me today.
I just arrived at my university for the lessons.
While walking I had 3 great signals:
1) At the tobacconist, I thought "I don't want to buy anything for smoking"
2) A cute girl was smoking. I told you in some previous message that asking the lighter or a cig was an excuse to talk to her. Today I thought: "I don't want to ask her a cigarette"
3)I was very annoyed for the smell of smoke coming from the little open space near my zone of lessons.

I am happy expecially for 1) and 2). Until yesterday, I used to have a crave and to repeat myself "Not one more puff" or to breathe three times in a row. However there always was the "soldier" part of me that had to take care of my cravings.
Today I automatically thought that I did not want anything.

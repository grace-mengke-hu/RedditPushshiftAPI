Is vaping cheating?

Please be kind, this is my first time posting here. Thank you. 

History: 29yo, smoking for 15 years: I have tried about 3 times (with earnest) to quit. My longest non-smoking stint was 6 months and I used Chantix to stop, but the medication made me suicidal. I'm not doing that again. Patches make my arms painful and tingly, and gums and lozenges burn my mouth.

So my question is, if I were to slowly decrease my nicotine intake using a vaporizer, could I technically call myself a non-smoker? Can I start my "quit date" the day I stop cigarettes and switch to vaping?

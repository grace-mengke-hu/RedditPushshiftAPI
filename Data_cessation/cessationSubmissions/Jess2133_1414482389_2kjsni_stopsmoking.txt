2 weeks!

I have been smoking for 10 years in Feb of next year, which is almost half of my life, well I tried Champix 2 years ago, and it was a terrible experience, but I decided about a month ago to try again, and It has worked! I've nearly made it 2 weeks without a smoke and I'm so proud of myself, even if I used a drug to help me stop. 

I never thought I'd kick the habit, I never felt strong enough. I just hope I don't relapse. 

YAY ME!

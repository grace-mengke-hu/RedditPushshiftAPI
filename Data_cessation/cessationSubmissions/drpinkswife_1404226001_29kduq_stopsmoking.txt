Wow If I Make I'm Going to be A Terror!

I bitched a while ago that I went to the city centre for sandwiches and had to walk through various clouds of smoke and it stank!

I seriously, 2 hours later can still smell it! I feel like I need to take a shower and I haven't smoked!

Wow, I don't want to run into me in a month if this keeps up!

On the other hand I give myself license to be queen bitch for these early days, as long as I keep it to the appropriate forums and don't start telling people on the street that they stink!

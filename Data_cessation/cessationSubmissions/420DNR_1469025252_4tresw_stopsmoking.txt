What happened to 3 days being the worst

Okay so I'm at 9 days now, so I'm over the 3 days and 1 week. For the past three or four days I have thought about cigarettes constantly. 

The first three days were a cakewalk compared to this, what's happening? I went into this expecting the worst to come first and the opposite seems to be happening.

easiest day 1 ever.

i've tried to quit dozens of times and failed, up until the last time i made it a few months and then caved over alcohol or something like that.

that being said, in a few more hours i'll be done with day 1 of no longer being a cigarette smoker FOR GOOD, no more pack-a-day, no more "i'll just smoke it with weed", none of that shit.

that being said, i have relapsed about a million times, and everyone around me knows it, so it's going to be rough. this ain't my first rodeo.

edit: okay, okay. it's never easy. :-/ but i'm still making it. time to sleep soon.

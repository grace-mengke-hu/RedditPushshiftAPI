Cigarettes are the only way I know how to cope with high amounts of stress.

I'll start by saying I'm on day 35 without cigarettes but I am using patches. 
  
My gf and I are in a bit of a rough patch in our relationship. We might end up breaking up and it's really stressing me out a lot. All I can think about is going to the store and buying a pack of cigarettes. I don't know any other way to cope with this kind of stress.
  
Everything has been fine until now but this craving is not passing. I've wanted to go buy cigarettes since last night when we started talking about how shitty our relationship is, and it hasn't passed since.

Edit: I want to thank everyone for the great advice. I've read everyone's comments and I appreciate the support, it really has helped me. I was able to move past this big craving partially thanks to everyone here! :)

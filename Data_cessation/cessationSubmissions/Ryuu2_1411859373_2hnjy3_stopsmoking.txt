The smells are real!

Smoking never affected my taste & smell to the extent that most people go through, but today I realized I did miss out on some smells. I was walking around my house and the windows were propped open...a wind gust blew by and I felt the smell of fall. I had a quick flashback of my childhood and it was such a wonderful moment. 

Anyways, just wanted to share that tidbit with my peoples.

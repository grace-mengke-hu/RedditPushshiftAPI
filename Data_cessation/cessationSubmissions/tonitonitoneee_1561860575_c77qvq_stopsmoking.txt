11 days smoke-free, but I’m about to celebrate at a bar tonight.

Like the title said, I’m going to a bar tonight for my birthday. I’m a little worried because one of my favorite parts about going to a bar is socializing outside with the smokers.

What are some tricks you have for going out smoke-free without giving in to temptation?

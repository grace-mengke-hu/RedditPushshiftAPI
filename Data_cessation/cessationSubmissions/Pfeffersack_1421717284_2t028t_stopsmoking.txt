Thanks for All the Fishâ€”don't quit being awesome

It's been 556 days of not smoking a single thing\*. With your help, i.e. badge bot and the **incredible helpful, supportive community**, I realize that I'm not a regular smoker.

My father's not a smoker but his dad and his brothers were. My granddad smoked cigars and my uncles were (God bless them all) heavy cigarette smokers. My granddad was a blue collar pipe smoker and one of my uncles quit smoking when he met his wife.

[Trigger?] Today, I'm smoking my first high-quality cigar in almost two years. Feels good. Way better than the cigarettes I almost became addicted to. Tobacco is still dangerous to your and my health and I'm not immune to it. I'm not immune to Nicotine nor to the addiction.  
I continue to regular exercise three times a week and I'm not planning to smoke anything for more than once every quarter of the year.

Thank you /r/stopsmoking! Thanks for all your experiences, your support/work, and your honesty. All the best.

*I'm going to delete the counter in three days and stay subbed. And revisit /r/stopsmoking if necessary!

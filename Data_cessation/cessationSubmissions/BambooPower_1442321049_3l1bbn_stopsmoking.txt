22 days smoke free...You can do it!

After 22 days my no smoking app says I should should 'share my success'.  I don't normally share my thoughts on websites but if I can help one person with my experiences then I will be happy!  

After 22 days of not smoking I can honestly say I have no desire to ever smoke again.  I have tried and failed to quit over the last 2 years but this time is different!  

I used a 3 week course of nicotine patches and 3 weeks of nicotine gum.  I was prepared this time, I took it one day at a time, I changed small aspects of my life all of which helped me to stop my 10 a day habit for over 10 years.  I REALLY struggled previously, I'd find it hard to go a day without having a cigarette but I kidded myself that when I wanted to quit I could quit.  

If you don't truly want to quit smoking then you never will. If you truly want to quit do some research first, read Allen Carr's book, have nicotine substitutes but don't get the e-cigarette, break the habit completely. Exercise, eat well, drink a lot of water, but don't try and do it all at once. Be realistic. If you fail to quit, don't worry, you just weren't ready. It can & will be done though, just have faith in yourself, set realistic targets and don't lie to yourself, I did millions of times!  

If anyone cares, this is how I did it...Download the 'Smoke Free' app, really helpful.  Prepare yourself, give yourself a 7 day countdown to the quit day. Quitting midweek helped me, quit in the morning to give yourself an 8 hour head start on the nicotine cravings. You do get cravings, but they're literally all in your head. I have more time on my hands, smell better, feel healthier and love being in a social situation without having to smoke. I went from loving smoking to loving not smoking. All in 3 weeks. I think I have said enough...I hope this helps give someone encouragement, but YOU have to do it!

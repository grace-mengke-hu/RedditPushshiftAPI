Quit smoking a week ago, coughing up some weird stuff...is this normal?

So I quit smoking a week ago after 9 years and I am coughing up all kinds of weird stuff. Is this normal? Anyone else have this?

Edit ; thanks for all the replies. Gonna use this as a motivation as many of you have said. Just got keep off the nicotine.

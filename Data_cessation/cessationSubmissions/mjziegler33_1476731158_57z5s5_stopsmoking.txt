Day 1...

Day 1 of my first ever try at quitting. 12 years/1+ pack per day....
So far, so good. I mean, i am getting antsy every hour, when driving, after eating, etc.

Tried eating dum dums outside as a replacement, which is doing ok. Wife had some health problems and needs to quit ASAP, so extra motivation for me is the pressure to stand with her on that.

Has anyone been in a similar situation where the health of a loved one is your primary motivation? Wondered if it was actually easier doing it for some one you love than it was to do for you.

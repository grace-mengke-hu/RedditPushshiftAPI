Thank you laryngitis

I made this throw away account so that I can post this here.  Last Friday night my throat was a bit sore, nothing really to worry about, has happened before.  I went to bed a bit early as I was feeling drained and a bit sick. 

When I woke up Saturday morning I found I had no voice.  I was scared.  I figured that it was laryngitis and did some research on the computer and found a lot saying stop smoking if you do.  Well the last time I had a smoke was on Friday night just before supper and here we are, going on 5 days now and feeling better.  I am starting to get my voice back and things are looking up.  

I am on a friend's butt, who is suffering from COPD and smokes 2 packs a day to quit as well with me.  This has scared the shit out of me and I have no intentions of ever going back.

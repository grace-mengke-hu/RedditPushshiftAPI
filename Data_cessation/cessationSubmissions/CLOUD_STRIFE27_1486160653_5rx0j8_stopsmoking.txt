2 Years

Hey Quitters!

I was reminded today by my quit smoking app that it's been two years as of today that I quit.  I honestly should delete the app because I never even think about smoking anymore but thankfully it reminded me that you all are still out here quitting.  

I just want to let you all know, YOU CAN DO IT.  I quit using Allen Carr's book and have since convinced 4-5 of my friends and family members who smoke to get it.  I know self-help books aren't helpful to some but if you've not read it, and you're here trying to quit, I suggest picking up a copy.  

Keep it up everyone and join me in not smoking today!

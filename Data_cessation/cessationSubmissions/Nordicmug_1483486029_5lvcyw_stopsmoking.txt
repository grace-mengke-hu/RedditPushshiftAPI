Chantix/Champix?

Hello all!

I'm just wondering if anyone else is using this to quit? I've used it in the past with success. The regular dosage is actually too strong for me, so I was only taking 1/4 of a pill once a day (with my dr's ok).

After I feel off the wagon in December I'm back on it but taking 1/2 a pill a day this week. The only side effect I've noticed is the dreams and a bit of an upset tummy for the first 15 minutes after taking it.

I think this time I need to stay on it for a few months and NO drinking at all. That is where I always seem to lose my quit. I start thinking because the Champix makes it easier that I can smoke while drinking. Not this time. I plan to hold onto this quit forever.

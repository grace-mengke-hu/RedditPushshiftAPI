600 days

11/25/13 to 7/19/15 is 600 days with smoking a cigarette. For me, that's also 9,010 cigarettes not smoked. That actually triggers a gag reflex now when I think of that! All that tar and nastiness...

To those just starting and reading this:

* Yes, your first few weeks will the the toughest. Use whatever mechanism you have chosen and embrace it. You can and will get over this minor hurdle. That's why you came here, right? Don't lurk. Post. Are you stressing and think you're going to light up? then Post and new topic and go grab you gum, lozenge, stress ball, or go bang your SO. ANYTHING to kill the crave.
* Get the QuitNow app and spring for [the paid app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.eagin.software.android.dejaloYa) because you will keep it long after your quit date. Plus, it has achievements like the Xbox One has, so if you're a gamer, there's some additional motivation. I have only one item left under "Health" to get to 100%. "Risk of developing lung cancer at same level as a non-smoker" which is sitting at 32% right now. By that time, I'll have the 10 achievements I don't have and only then will I consider removing the app. Also, it's only USD $2.99, which is way lower than the price of a pack in most areas.
* Get someone or a support group. I didn't really have that at the level I wanted and could have used it at times. I never relapsed, but I dd come close once or twice. sometimes, I think of how easy it would have been to walk into 7-11 to grab a pack and then I think about all the progress I would have lost and the starting over. As I'm sure more than a few of you can attest, starting over isn't a place you want to be if you can help it.

I started the easy way. I got sick around Thanksgiving in 2013. Taking a drag made my lungs feel like they were on fire. I just had to stop. Somehow, my brain and it's addiction center accepted that as a logical reason not to smoke. Of course, I was also quite medicated because I didn't want to feel miserable because of the cold/flu/what the hell ever it was I had. I'm willing to bet that helped curb the edge for the first few weeks. By the time I felt like I was recovering, three weeks had passed, so I figured why not keep going? So, I did. The only real support I had was the aforementioned app and my wife, who was encouraging me without quitting herself. No Chantix, no patches, not even a pack of Twizzlers. Just got sick one day, couldn't smoke and said "Fuck it, I'm done."

The hardest part was, and still is, my wife. She's one of those people who refuses to quit because she thinks it defines part of who she is. "I'm not me if I'm not smoking." I don't get that, but I'm tired of arguing about it. I finally got her to not smoke indoors before I quit, so there's that, at least. She always comes to see me in my home office after she's had one. My back is to the door, but I know the second she's behind be because I smell it. The lingering smoke. Ugh.

Anyway, I'm rambling now. My point is that yes, it's tough at first, but stick to it and it WILL get easier. Plus, you won't stink, you'll save money, and you'll just be healthier by NOT doing something.

Good Luck!

What you have to look forward to...

I quit 243 days ago and so much has changed. I went from drinking heavily regularly to having maybe one drink a week. I dropped 23 pounds. I exercise every day now (I hadn't exercised since high school and I'm 33). I eat super healthy (before it was all fried food all the time). And on and on.

One healthy life choice leads to more and more. You're not just quitting smoking, you're beginning the process of becoming a new better you.

Keep it up.

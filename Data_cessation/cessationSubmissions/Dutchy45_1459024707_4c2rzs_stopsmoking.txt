Quitting Champix

2 days ago I decided to stop with the Champix pills. But only if I could handle the cravings. After all it's all about quitting smoking, a few more days or weeks taking those pills is not important. Still, I'm happy to report that I feel very little difference. No nicotine cravings so far. It feels like I've taken another step on the road to becoming an ex-smoker. I'll hang on to those pills for a few more days, just to make sure, and then pass them on to a friend who failed at quitting 2 months ago. Good luck to all you quitters out there!

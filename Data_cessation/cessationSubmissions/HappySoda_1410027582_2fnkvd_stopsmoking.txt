So last night, I went to a smokey bar and kind of got drunk...

I'm in Europe, so most people smoke here. The bar had a low hanging haze like the San Francisco Bay. I used to be a tournament-level pool player. But after months of not playing at all, I was shooting like crap and started to get visibly frustrated and stressed. One thing led to another, I ended up getting drunk.

But guess what? I DIDN'T SMOKE!!!

In fact, the thought didn't even cross my mind. I was pretty surprised at that. I'm so proud of myself right now, I'm going to go grill myself some nice chicken :)

p.s. I used to smoke in my office at home. Of course, I'd keep the windows wide open to air the place out. I always made sure the room had no traces of smoke left before I close the windows. Now that I can smell again... yeah, that was not the case at all. I need to figure out what to do with the lingering cigarette smell. 

p.p.s. Two nights ago, my wife said something to me that shocked me. I haven't told her that I quit smoking. I poked her in the nose; once of those "boop" things. She instantly said, "Honey, you should quit smoking. I can smell your finger. This is actually the first time I have smelled it." I was shocked. The reason that was her first time smelling it on my finger is because her sense of smell diminished as well through second hand smoking! I have always been really careful with smoking around her. But now I finally realized that being "careful" wasn't nearly enough.

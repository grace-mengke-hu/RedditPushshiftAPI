Looking for tips

I need to quit smoking.  I have been smoking for 15 years.  I want to do it cold turkey.   One of the things that has always held me back is the fear of the unknown.  Anyone care to share how the first few weeks were for them?  I hear horror stories from people about gaining weight, can't sleep, being totally cranky, etc.  Fear of those things is what has held me back in the past.
Honestly, what did you all experience in the first few days and weeks?

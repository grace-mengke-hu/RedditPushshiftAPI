Anybody here use benzos occasionally while quitting cigarettes?

Now I know that benzos can be extremely dangerous and addictive, and the last thing I'm going to do is substitute 1 vice for another. I also know that benzos have no chemical property that will ease the urge to smoke. But I was wondering if the occasional valium(think half a pill every couple days) would help me specifically, my biggest problem with past quits have been severe panic attacks and hypochondria (probably due to my body operating differently without nicotine) so I was thinking of getting a couple valium for the first week or so, to help me cope during the first week or so. So I was wondering, has anybody used any type of benzo during their quit. Thank you.

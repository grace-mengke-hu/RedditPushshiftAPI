I've gone 67 days

And I hate it!

I didn't want to quit, as some others can relate. I liked smoking. I like the taste, the feel, the relaxing mindset, and the excuse to go outside and detach. My husband has been badgering me to quit since we met and finally with a child I quit. I can't stand it. I resent him for hating my habit and making me change. I'm proud to have gone so long of course and I feel somewhat better. I feel like it was taken from me, not that I made the choice and quit. 

I know with a child it is extremely selfish to want to smoke but I do anyway. I would not be smoking around her regardless and would wash up before interacting with her. Growing up myself I never minded my parents smoking and was actually curious. The first cigarettes i had at age 13 were my mothers (I stole them). I would not want my kiddo picking up the habit because of me but I damn sure want to keep smoking. At this point I feel there is no going back because I've made it this far, but i harbor that anger, resentment, and longing still. any advice to move past the emotions?

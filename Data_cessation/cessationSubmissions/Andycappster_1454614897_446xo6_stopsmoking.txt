Biggest Hurdle

It has been almost 6 months since my last cigarette. I have my taste and smell back. It's amazing. But my largest hurdle so far has actually been filling up the time I used to kill with cigarettes. If you think about it - smoking a pack a day gets rid of very boring moments. Bored? Have a cigarette. Hungry? Have a cigarette. TV commercial? Have a cigarette. In the car? Smoke time! 

It has been challenging to find good activities to kill this time... At first I used food, but now that I'm 30 pounds heavier than then I've strayed away. My partner, who also quit smoking at the same time, has lost his time in video games. Sometimes I find that during those cigarette-filled moments of the day we bicker about the dumbest things. 

So my question to the ex-smokers out there is what was your biggest hurdle? How did you get over it? Or did you?

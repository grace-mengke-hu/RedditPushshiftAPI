It Doesn't All Suck.

This is mostly for me. I post everyday so I can look back and see my journey and remind myself why I never can have 'just one'. I can also look  back and diagnose myself as a bi-polar drama queen bitch. Shit, it's been a roller coaster.

What I need today is to remind myself that it can be like this.

After my complete emotional meltdown yesterday...everything has settled down.

I had a smooth calm no craving day. Just a regular non-smokers day. No arguments, no crying, no drama, no Doritos.

Life can be good. 

This evening I will take more steps to make my life more fulfilling. I'm applying for two new jobs that I am totally qualified to do and get out of the shit hole environment where I'm currently employed. 

And I can apply for these position without having to hide anything. I don't smoke and that has opened all kinds of doors in my field. I'm confident today.

Yay me.

Edit: Done applying for jobs! 5.5 hours later (this is what happens when you bring the doctor in to help edit, fuck I'm cream crackered!) It's 2:25 AM Nite nite. :)

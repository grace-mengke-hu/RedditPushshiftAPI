Cravings worse after a month.

So tonight, for no reason in particular it seems, I had the worst physical craving for a cigarette that I've had since I quit 33 days ago after being a smoker for 12 years.  

Most of the time I have craved cigarettes it's been because I was sad or stressed. The first few weeks I was irritable a bit, my husband who still smokes bore the brunt of that. I didn't get irritable or angry tonight, which was fascinating, but I physically wanted one so bad I was so incredibly close to asking my husband for a drag. 

I didn't end up asking, but I was as close as I've been to smoking in a month.  Has anyone else experienced this? Where cravings got more intense after time?

I got a cold, haven’t smoked for 4 days, so I’m gonna try again.

I’m 26 and I started smoking when I was 11 years old. (Not seriously until I was 19 and could buy my own, tho)

I’ve been trying to quit longer than I can even remember, and have made it 3 months once, 2 months on another occasion, and a handful of 2 or 3 weeks quits. 

My main pitfall in the quit attempts has been that most of my closest people smoke (best friends, even my mom, I’m a professional cook as well) and the temptation is just so much sometimes.

This all being said, I have a regular meditation practice now, I’m in a DBT therapy group and individual therapy—so I’m going to try again. I’m posting here because no one in my life takes it seriously that I’ll quit, and I just wanna tell someone. ❤️

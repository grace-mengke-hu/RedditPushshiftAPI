Herbal cigarettes as placebo replacement?

I'm considering replacing my normal cigarettes with the tobacco-free herbals. I feel the hardest part for me is the physical feeling associated. Similar to taking off a ring you've worn for a long time (or something to that liking).

I quit with laser therapy for a year and a half, but only did the first of three sessions. I don't know if that really mattered or not. But, after the first two weeks, I craved that physical feeling so bad that I bought a couple packs of the herbals. Smoked the first like a normal pack, and then the second day, put it out after a few drags because it was simply not doing it for me.

I think they helped me a lot to stay on track then and am curious to see how it would work for me now. Has anyone else tried this method?

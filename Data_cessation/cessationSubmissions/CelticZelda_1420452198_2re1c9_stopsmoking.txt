Not too bad so far...

But I know that will change. Going into 3 days smoke free and it's been pretty easy. Had a few cravings but nothing terrible. I know though from a previous quit that I can't get cocky because the addict brain will come up and mess with me when I least expect it. Oh just have one and take that edge off, you'll be able to handle having one cigarette now and then, no big deal. JUST SAY NO! When I listened to my addict and started to smoke again after some very stressful times, I ended up smoking more than I was when I quit! And carried on with smoking more. So, I will come here and blather away and remember why I no longer smoke. I hope you all don't get tired of me... I know the next few days to be the toughest for me in terms of cravings.

Thanks for being here for all of us.

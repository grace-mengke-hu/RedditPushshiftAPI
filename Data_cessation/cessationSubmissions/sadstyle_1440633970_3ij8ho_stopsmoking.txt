The past two weeks have been a struggle.

About three months into my quit I lost all cravings and urges to smoke. I was seeing improvements in my health, and was overall glad I finally took the plunge. Everything was fine up until my first anniversary. The cravings came back in full force, and I'm seriously struggling to not light up. I'm not sure why now. 

Seeing my colleagues at work make me want a puff. I know one puff is all it takes to get back to 20 a day. It all makes sense rationally but the cravings are not going away. Yesterday I took a cigarette off one of my colleagues. I didn't light it up because I didn't have a lighter, and so I left it on my desk at work. I don't want to ruin all the progress I had done, but I'm not sure how to fight the urges head on now.

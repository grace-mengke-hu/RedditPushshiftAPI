2 weeks smoke free!

Today is a good day.  I'm feeling so much better and stronger and have really cemented my commitment to quitting.  The cravings are getting better or at least I'm dealing with them in a better way.  I am able to drink beer at home with limited cravings that I am able to handle.  Things are looking up!

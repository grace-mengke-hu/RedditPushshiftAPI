stopped for a week now but now my i drink much more than i used to.

Hey guys,

Stopped smoking for about a week now. The only problem I have is that I drink way too much because I have a much higher tolerance and I like to go out and have a good time and all. I'm worried that this could become a major problem and i might get addicted to alcohol because i need a lot more to get sort of drunk.
Can anybody give me some advice on how to deal with this?

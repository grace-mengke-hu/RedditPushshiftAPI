Why is it so difficult to quit?

I'm a nonsmoker, always have been, although on the occasional night out I've had a few cigarettes here as a way of meeting people.
Anyway, my SO is a smoker, we've only been together for about 3 months but he told me in the first month he was going to quit. He had a pack of tobacco and quite confidently said "This will be my last pouch."
Well within a few hours of running out he had to go out and buy more saying that it was harder than he was expecting.

I've bought him Allan Carr's book which I have read (to make sure that it was worth reading) but he hasn't (he works 60+ hour weeks and isn't all that big on reading so I don't blame him too much for that.)

I just want to understand WHY it is so hard to quit??? What does a craving feel like to be so strong that it is THAT difficult to quit??? Help me understand how he continually lights up while continually saying that he's going to quit soon...

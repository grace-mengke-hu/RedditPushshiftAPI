I think the emotional “side effects” of quitting smoking are worse than the physical

I’m on day five. I don’t think I’m having any more physical withdrawal but I’ve been an emotional mess today. Cried on my way to work and on the way home. I didn’t smoke, but I did have the thought that I would feel so much better if I did. The emotions are what did me in the last time I quit. I know the emotional relief is only temporary though. I also have bipolar disorder so it could be depression, but I don’t think so. I hate cigarettes. Nicotine is the worst kind of slave master because even when you get free you get Stockholm Syndrome and want to go back. I’m just glad the stores are all closed right now so I can’t just run out and by some.

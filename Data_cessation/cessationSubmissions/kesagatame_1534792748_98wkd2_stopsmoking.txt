Piiiiiiiiisssss

Sorry for cursing. It's just what runs through my head most of these days recently. I'm on holiday in a country where they don't sell Snus. It's what I've been (ab)using to lay off smoking for the last month or so. Before that, around two months of vaping.

I cheated twice in the last three months and resisted countless times.

I'm so over giving in to this harmful, useless, revolting behaviour pattern.

It's fine. You can afford one every once in a while. It won't hurt you again, promise.

No. Shut up. Just gonna be toughing it out this time. No excuses. I don't care if I white knuckle and sweat and curse and even if I go to get support like you guys, I am shifting my focus elsewhere 1000 times until something sticks.

Wouldn't it be nice to be able to blame smoking  for not feeling well... To adopt the impulsiveness and risk-taking as some kind of cloak to mask my insecurity in social situations and when feeling unfulfilled engaging in mindless activities.

Guess that's not an option anymore, time to confront what a curmudgeony, irritated prick my brain is going to be.

And I'm gonna win this time. Because I will stay ever vigilant and you better believe it.

God fucking damnit.

A difficult choice

I quit 4 days ago due to being unable to afford a pack with recent expenses and how can I not just buy a pack again when the opportunity arises? What's stopping me? I was forced to start rather than chose. I have tried electric cigarettes but all that did was keep me just addicted in between cigs. It did the one thing that really helped though, eliminate cravings. Should I go cold turkey and hope I just don't give or begin the process of using the e-cig again or should I continue smoking for a short time until I'm fully willing to quit to avoid relapse? I seek your advice in this critical time.

Day One!

I've smoked for six years, I've quit before, I've tried gum, patches, inhalers and Champix. But the thing that always brings me back is the social aspect. My friends smoke, my girlfriend smokes and my housemates smoke. But not this time! I'm on holiday with my family overseas, none of them smoke and they all hate the smell (bloody fitness nuts!)
If no one around me is smoking, there'll be no limp excuses to smoke, no desperate reasoning that if I don't have one before bed I won't sleep. All I need to do is keep busy. 
Thanks r/stopsmoking, y'all an inspiration!

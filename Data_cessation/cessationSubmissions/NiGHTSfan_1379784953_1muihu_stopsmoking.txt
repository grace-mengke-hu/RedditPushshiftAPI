Okay, /r/stopsmoking, I'm quitting today.

I've been smoking for two years now (I'm 21), and I've been thinking about quitting for a while now. I read Easyway, and that sort of recontextualized the way I'd been thinking about smoking. Just like everyone else, I thought I'd *never* get addicted to something as disgusting and expensive as cigarettes, which killed my grandmother and are killing my grandfather. I can barely afford my rent because of my pack-a-day habit. I feel that I can't concentrate without them, and I hate the fact that I continue to do them.

So, I'm quitting. Right now. It isn't worth putting off. It's not going to go away until I do something about it. 

I want to start cycling. I want to start working out. I want to stop having to excuse myself every hour or so to go stand outside, alone, killing myself with this stupid habit. I want to stop smelling like cigarettes.

I'm dead-set on this, though I know it's going to be difficult. Thanks for the inspiration, guys.

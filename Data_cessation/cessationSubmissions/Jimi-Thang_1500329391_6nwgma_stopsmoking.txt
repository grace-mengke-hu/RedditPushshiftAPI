Put down cigarettes, but picked up a vape

I smoked my last cig on friday. I bought a vape on saturday, and it is actually working. I plan to stabilize on the vape at 6mg. Then, i will gradually decrease to no nicotine. After I quit daily use, I will probably keep it around for times when I know I will be in a situation where I really want to smoke. Hopefully, a day will come where no situation makes me want to smoke! Is this a feasible plan? Or, am I picking up another thing to quit?

Made it!

I made it to 28 days with only one slip up! (I posted it a couple of weeks back... my boyfriend accidentally stabbed himself...) 
This is the longest I've gone without smoking and I'm so proud of myself. I credit this subreddit with motivating me to keep quitting!
So good luck to everyone who is just starting to quit, and keep going for everyone that has quit!
YOU CAN DO IT!

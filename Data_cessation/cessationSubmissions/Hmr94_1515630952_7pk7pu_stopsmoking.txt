Over emotional crazy person

Today is the first time I don’t feel like a smoke every 10 minutes after failing twice on my quit, But I’m so emotional I just cried in a take away shop over something my mum tagged me in on Facebook. I’m a crazy person, my poor boyfriend needs more love and I just don’t have enough energy in me at the moment. I can’t wait until I beat this. Who else is crazy?

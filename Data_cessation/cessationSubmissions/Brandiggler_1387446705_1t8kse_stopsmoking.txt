It's time to stop.

I'm 28, been a smoker for about 5 years now. This is my umpteenth time trying to quit. Tired of feeling my heart beating fast for no reason, wasting money, knowing I'll most likely run into health problems as I get older and I don't want not being able to breathe on top of whatever else in life comes at me over the years. It's so simple, just walk away. Easier said than done, but not today. Today it's easier done. Sucking on the little things for no reason, going inside and outside all day for what? To relieve some stress? To think for a moment? This is adding to all of the stress. I didn't used to want them, they slowly wrapped me up and sunk themselves in like a parasite that wants to feed. Not so much at first but as time went on the parasite wanted more.. and more, and more. To satiate it was to satiate myself, or so they'd have you think. You don't need them, they need you. So I took all my Camels out of the pack, broke all but one in half. I lit up the final cig, said my goodbyes and tossed it away having only smoked half. A weight has lifted. I know there will be the moments of anxiety that I know a smoke would fill in the gap just right.. but no! That's the programming trying to take over. Listen to it kick and scream and beg, it'll get nothing from me. I think I'll watch some netflix now, with a calm heart inside the warm house. Sorry this is kind of a rant but I find if I release this online and not so much to my friends and family there will be less pressure and a much smoother transition. At least in my case. If you've read this far, thank you and I know you can beat those little assholes too. Cheers.

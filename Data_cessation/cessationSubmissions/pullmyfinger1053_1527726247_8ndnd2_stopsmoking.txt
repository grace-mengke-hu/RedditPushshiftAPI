Back on that pony!

I ended up relapsing after 7 days and man it proper blows. As soon as I had a cig yesterday morning I regretted it. Proper feel like a dick because I managed to have a few beers over the weekend, resisted the cravings and didn't crack. 

I'm currently at work and I've ended up throwing my baccy, filters and papers in the bin because I just can't be arsed with smoking anymore. I told myself that I was going to smoke through this pouch of the finest Amber Leaf and that'll be the end of it, but then again why should I do that? I want to quit now and that's what I'm going to do. 

Badge reset, smoke free app reset..

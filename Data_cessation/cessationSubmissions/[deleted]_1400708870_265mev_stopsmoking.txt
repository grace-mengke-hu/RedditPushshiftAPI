Hi, I'd like to introduce myself. I need to quit.

I'll keep things plain and simple. Long story short, my parents were both smokers, I grew up around it. My mom died from lung cancer when I was 5. It took my dad another 5 years, but he quit. It took everything he had to quit smoking. 

I have never had an addictive personality. I don't drink very often, I've smoked weed but never more than just a bowl here or there. And when I joined the military, weed was way out of the question, so I never did it again. But, I picked up smoking in the military. I smoked on and off for about a year. I quit immediately when I found out I was pregnant. It wasn't hard. I quit cold turkey, never had cravings, nothing.

I've been smoking regularly for a little over a year now. 6 cigarettes a day is my average. I have developed a terrible cough. My fitness is still good, but I know it could be so much better if I quit. I originally started smoking to deal with anxiety. I have a terribly abusive ex who chastised me for going to therapy and taking anxiety medication, called me weak, worthless, unfit, a bad mom, you name it. So, I ditched the pills and picked up the cigarettes. What started as a coping mechanism for me has now turned into this terrible habit that I hate. I don't like smoking, it doesn't do anything for me. But, it's now a routine. My new years resolution this year was to quit smoking, and for 2 or 3 months, I kept telling myself, "this is my last pack, after this, I'm done." Finally, I decided to stop lying to myself. I knew I wasn't ready to quit. I know what a hole this has burned in my pocket, and how much money I could have saved had I never started in the first place.

Was pointed here from a comment on a thread in AskReddit. This looks like a great community, and with your support, perhaps I can finally kick the habit and be healthy again.

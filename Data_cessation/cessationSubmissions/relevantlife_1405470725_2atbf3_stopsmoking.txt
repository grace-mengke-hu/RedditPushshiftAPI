Well, today is day one.

I have not had a cigarette since last night. It was a camel crush. I didn't think I had any left, as I finished the last one in my pack during the drive home, but later on last night I remembered I had dropped a Camel between the seat and the center console in my car a few days before. You bet your ass I was out there with a flashlight digging through change and trash at almost midnight for that one lousy fucking cigarette. 

But, it was my last. I am swearing off cigarettes for good. Quitting cigarettes, along with my new vegan diet, will send my risks of cancers and strokes way down. My breathing will improve and I will be able to do many more physical activities.

However, there is the downside. What will I do to kill time? What will I do when I don't have that cigarette to cure my road rage? I will miss cigarettes. I will mourn their loss. The withdrawals already suck. I've been tired as fuck all day even with coffee. And irritable. But this too shall pass. 


We'll see if I make it past week 2. That's as far as I've ever gotten.

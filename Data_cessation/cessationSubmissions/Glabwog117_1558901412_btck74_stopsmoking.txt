Being Emotionally Unstable after Quitting

I recently just quit smoking, and I find myself very emotional. I have been feeling extremely low and have random fits of tearing up/crying. I am not usually so emotional, but I have been finding myself riding an emotional rollercoaster since I quit. Was wondering if anyone else had this? How long did it last? How did you handle it?

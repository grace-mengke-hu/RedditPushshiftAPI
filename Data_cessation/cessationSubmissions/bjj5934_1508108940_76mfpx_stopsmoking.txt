It's time

I've been smoking for ten years now and told my self that if I was still smoking at 27 I would stop. Lately, I started cutting back on how much I smoked to start to teach my body to not rely on smokes so much. Since I have cut from a pack every two days to a pack a week, I  started bike riding in cool weather, and working out(crossfit) but my throat has started hurt specifically my thyroid and I feel like I'm coughing up little bits of mucus. I keep jamming my fingers around trying to feel for bumps which are not there. I do this to the point that my throat hurts from constantly touching it. Is throat pain normal when cutting back? 

***sorry about the horrible paragraph, WebMD said it's the c word and I am freaking out.

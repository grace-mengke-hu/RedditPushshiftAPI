4 weeks in: gratitude post!

Tomorrow will be four weeks and I thought I'd note some of my observations as I think a ton has changed already!

- **family**: this is probably the biggest and most awesome. I'm present to my family (wife + 3 kiddos) *so* much more of the time. I don't think it's the total amount of time I was always outside smoking, but the type of interaction that my habit allowed for. I was always half out the door, thinking to the next cigarette. I'd avoid/postpone longer term activities, prefer something where they might be self-entertained vs. something where I was directly involved as it let me sneak away. I'm just fully "there" now. We can read every night before bed, play a long game of scrabble, watch a movie, etc. My wife is tremendously appreciates me being around so much more and we spend immensely more time together (including kissing a ton more!).

- **work:** I love feeling a lot more pride in the quality of work I get done. I used to come in on the late side (smoke first thing in the morning, eat, smoke again, maybe putz around reading something or whatever, and smoke one more time before showering to leave) and leave early. While I still worked remotely (from home, coffee shop, etc.) and this is accepted at my workplace, it limited the sort of things I could get done. I'd favor "busy work" which wasn't the top priority over the stuff I'd have to be physically at work for since it let me smoke when I wanted. I just stay as long as I want now and having that burden of slacking/half-assing removed is so amazing.

- **home:** I'm absolutely slaying tasks. I felt pretty drained for a bit, but am now just hauling ass and blowing through so much stuff that sat and sat and sat. I gutted our office/toy/book area and we gave away probably 10 bags of stuff. Everything has a place, got dusted/cleaned, etc. We could actually see what kind of crafty things didn't have a place and go get some new storage thingies. Finally replaced a phone jack that's been hanging out of the wall for 3yrs or so. We have a home phone again! Painting the last cabinet door of a pantry remodel that's been sitting for months. I was *so* f-ing slow and procrastinate-y as a smoker it's unbelievable looking back. Smoke before starting. Find excuse to google/youtube something and smoke again. Smoke after like every f-ing micro-step of the process. It feels so good to be getting shit done and making a huge dent in how relaxing our environment is (I don't relax very well with stuff cluttered and lots of todos so this really taxed me).

- **opportunities:** this is just sort of a random bucket, but if something comes up like a lunch or outing, I can just do it. I used to avoid them depending on how long they'd be or if there was a risk someone would smell me as a smoker (and didn't already know). My life was sooooo run by smoking and I was such a slave. Every decision got filtered by how it would impact my ability to smoke as much as I wanted. It feels like so many opportunities are open to me now. Sub for soccer? Sure! Happy hour? Sure! Lunch with someone new at work? Sure! I can say "Yes" with no hesitation at all.

- **money:** we're not rich by any means, but I feel a ton less pressure financially. I don't think we're going wild by any means, but we're going to see a concert and I think there would have been a lot more hesitation from my wife about splurging on something like that. I bought her some earrings on a trip recently and literally thought "Hey, this is nothing. Not smoking for 5 days is like $40 saved right there!" Like I said, it's not like I'm rich, but not having it hang over my head that I'm throwing away like $200 a month is a huge weight lifted.

Alright, I think I'll leave it be. Just felt like writing a little bit and expressing some gratitude. It's amazing what *one single* change can do to life. Smoking was the single worst thing I've ever, ever, ever done. Dropping the immense shame I carried around primarily because I knew I wasn't being true to my wife and kids is such a load off. Keep pressing on and thanks for all the direct/indirect support/encouragement from those in this group!

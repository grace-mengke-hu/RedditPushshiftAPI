Day one morning urge resisted.

My dentist told me yesterday that I must stop smoking before my next appointment. This has been a year coming. Last quit I tried chantix, but I didn't have my head space in order and I relapsed. I came home yesterday, hunkered down, and finished Allen Carr's book. I put out my last cigarette at 11:55 pm, feeling good about everything. This morning has been a struggle but I keep reminding myself "you are a non smoker and non smokers don't want cigarettes" alongside my own mantra "let this craving die and the rest will follow". Anyway, I'm headed into work and it'll be interesting but I'm ready to seize the day as a non smoker after 13 years.

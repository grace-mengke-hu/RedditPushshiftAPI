I'm trying not to think about it.

I am trying really hard to push it out of my mind. I've "quit" smoking like six times this year and given up after a week or two. This time I a am done quitting. I'm just not thinking about it. Not talking about it this time. I'm not going to bring any attention to it and I'm going to do my best to forget. This is the first time that I'm happy to say I quit. I'm effing done.

How long is the adrenaline/nervousness going to last?

Hi,   


I am on day 14 of not smoking. I genuinely don't want to go back to smoking because I genuinely think it is disgusting.   
However, have some of you noticed a type of adrenaline rush around the chest and solar plexus area? At first I thought it was anxiety, but I read a bit about anxiety and anxiety is more related to worrying. I am not worried at all, but these adrenaline rushes are quite annoying and can last for hours and up to a day.    


Can these be explained by cotinine withdrawals? I read cotinine which is a metabolite of nicotine can last up to 2 to 3 weeks into the body. Do you guys think it is related to that?    


Also, have  you guys also experienced these burning sensations around the solar plexus area? And when did they go away?

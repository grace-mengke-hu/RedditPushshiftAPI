Smoked 20 years, quit 15 months ago. Never slipped up, this time :-)

Tried multiple times to quit before, sometimes I even made it a few months, but always went back until this last time. Narrowed it down to having ditched a toxic friend. He would always tell me how strong I was for quitting (while lighting a smoke in front of me, and inhaling with overcompensated bliss). He would say, hey, you made it 2 weeks, you're totally past it! Here, reward yourself, just a drag won't hurt... I think I realized that quitting smoking was quitting a lifestyle, and quitting some friends. 15 months later, I can tell you, I feel so much better. I have much higher self esteem. I don't worry about burning my house down by leaving a butt smoldering. I don't worry that I stink. I'm not embarrassed of butts and ash cans when people come over. Or planning when and where I can sneak a smoke without anyone seeing me. 

I did, however, manage to put on 20 pounds, which leads to a whole new set of insecurities and worry, since I was maybe 20 over what I wanted to be when I quit. However, I can now climb a few flights of stairs and walk up hills without feeling like passing out, so I have that going for me.  My goal this year? Drop at least 30, maybe 40, possibly 50 pounds? Yoga. Strength and endurance and self love.  Health. 

The last year went by so fast, it proves that the effort I put in starting now will show its rewards in no time.

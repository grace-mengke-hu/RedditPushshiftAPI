Quitting e-cigs (juul)

I posted this in r/juul but just found this subreddit. I feel like you guys can help if possible. Thanks so much in advance. I appreciate it genuinely.


I hope y’all are doing well. I want to first apologize for this wall of text, but I’m feeling pretty out of it recently and I know some of you could probably help me out as youve experienced this. 


The first time I ripped a juul was the first day of my freshman year of college, nearly 2 and a half years ago. I thought it was weed and within seconds I was coughing my dick off. I’d never used nicotine besides dipping very rarely at home with my boys at a bonfire and never particularly loved it, it just made me sick. One thing led to another, just like I’m sure most of your juul stories could corroborate, and I was ripping my friends juuls until I eventually caved in and got my own. Naturally, my usage went up, and by the end of my freshman year and especially during pledging my fraternity, I was a pod a day. 

Due to some personal things, my sophomore year I got super depressed and my anxiety went through the roof. I used the juul to cope. It was there when I needed it. The money wasn’t really an issue, I worked and pods were just part of my expenses. Now it’s a year later and I can’t even wake up and be a functioning human without nicotine. I can’t concentrate on school when I don’t have nicotine. My anxiety is at an all time high when I don’t have nicotine. And that shit just scares the hell out of me. 

I’ve gone 24 hours before without it but I literally feel like death. I shake, sweat, even have thrown up, just because I don’t have it. Is there a way to quit that can alleviate some of these symptoms? I feel like cold turkey is the only option though, but I just don’t know.

Thanks.

TL;DR: got addicted to juul like everyone else. Used to it to cope with pledgeship, anxiety, stress, and depression. 2.5 years later if I try to quit I can’t function as a human. I need advice/help

A month of not smoking today, but I'm not happy

Not smoking is all I wanted to do when *I was* smoking.

I should be happy right now - 30 days is the longest I've gone without smoking. It's not just today, throughout this quit I've had this feeling. It's hard to explain but it feels like I'm missing something, and it feels sad to be missing it. 

In my earlier attempts there was an excitement about not smoking - everyday in the morning I used to be happy knowing another day went by without cigarettes. I always kept checking the "Quit smoking" app to see my progress. There's nothing like that like time.

Anyone experienced the same? How do I shake it off?

It's a **month** today, I want to be happy and celebrate.

How long until risk of lung cancer is reduced?

hey everyone, 

My app says that my risk of lung cancer is now 1% that of someone who has never smoked. Does this mean it will take me over EIGHT YEARS until my risk of lung cancer is the same as a person that didn't smoke?! I wasn't even a heavy smoker at all! God it makes me realise how unhealthy it is (stating the obvious!), but you try not to think about it when you're still smoking! Feeling a bit defeated!

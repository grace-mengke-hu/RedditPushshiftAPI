Feels like throat is swollen 1 week in

I quit once before because I had this, the doctor said it was a "Globus Sensation" and it wasn't serious, but just don't smoke.

relapsed

now I'm over a week into quitting again and it hasn't gone away. Has anyone else had this? It feels like parts of my throat are swollen and really dry, and I can't get enough water. Like I can feel things rubbing together and sometimes it activates my gag reflex.

Having a hard time getting rid of the last 2 per day.

So I used to be a pack a day for about 2-3 years. I’m on Wellbutrin and Topamax which has helped TREMENDOUSLY. I will put a disclaimer the Topamax is not specifically for smoking cessation but one of the off-label uses is to help people not binge eat so it’s thought to help impulse control.  I can go like 5-6 days without smoking, no problem. I don’t even think about it. And then when it’s time for work I get such bad cravings as soon as my seatbelt clicks. Lately I’ve been having 2-3 a day when I work (4 days a week, 10 hour shifts). I usually have 2 on the way to work (30 minute drive) and then 1 on the way home. I don’t take smoke breaks at work. I feel like such a wimp because I cannot break these last few. Being in my car alone is the worst. I have no cravings or issues when I’m driving with my SO in the car with me. I just want to quit so I don’t have the paranoid “do I smell like smoke?” when I get to work or when I get home. And for health reasons obviously. 

TL;DR: Does anyone have any advice on getting rid of the last one? Currently 3 a day when I work, struggle with cravings when I’m driving alone in my car.

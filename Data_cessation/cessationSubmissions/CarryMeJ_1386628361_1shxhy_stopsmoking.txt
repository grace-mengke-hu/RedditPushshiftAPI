Day 1 - Nervous but hopeful.

After a terrible couple of weeks i've realized how much more i've been smoking. While researching the internets for information on my fathers recently diagnosed Colon cancer i stumbled upon this fantastic little sub. 

Good luck to everyone else on their Day 1 (there seems to be a lot today.)

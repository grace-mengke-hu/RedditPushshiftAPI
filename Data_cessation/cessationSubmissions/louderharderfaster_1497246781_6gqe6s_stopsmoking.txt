Almost

It's day 9 for me and honestly, it has not been that difficult (I have NRT on hand) but tonight I almost slipped "just one, I'll buy just one off someone at the store and then that one will be my very last". 

So I gave myself an out. I can have one on my 75th birthday (I'm 48) if I still really want one and am still alive and if they still exist.

And then I added up all the bonuses from this week: there are the obvious (don't stink, saved money, better breathing) and then for me there is the bigger bonus of not hating myself for still smoking (all my friends quit long ago). 

I am not yet proud of myself for quitting (that will take a year) but I am very pleased with myself for not caving tonight.

Just another quick note to self. Good night all my fellow new and old non-smokers and lurkers. If I can do this, then you can (really).

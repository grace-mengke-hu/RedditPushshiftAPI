Quitting as a new year resolution has been going well, except for a major craving while having a drink. Other than "don't drink then" any advise?

It had been going incredibly well, not one cigarette in three days. 
That is, until me and my mates went out for a huge dinner and more than a few rounds.
Well, I got so drunk I didn't realize I had lit a cigarette until I was half way through it. Needless to say, I must have smoked *at least* half a pack that night. 
Havenâ€™t smoked again in a week (that was on the 4th), no unreasonable/overwhelming cravings at all.
Until yesterday, when I had two glasses of scotch during a business lunch. Didn't smoke, but oh man, I did have bad cravings.
I usually drink once or twice a week, so it is not the frequency that concerns me. The fact that alcohol triggers cravings, does.
It's as if a few drinks in and will power begins diluting in alcohol.
Has anyone else experienced/beat this?

30 days: Thoughts on sleep, exercise, and turning into a monster.

Through you awesome people, Easyway, and my family, I made it through the first 30 days!

Just a couple of thoughts on my experience for those still lurking or who have made the decision to be free of cigarettes.  

Sleep: About 2 and 1/2 weeks in, the quality of my sleep dropped off dramatically.  I was waking in the middle of the night and either drifting in and out of light sleep for the rest of the night or just staying awake.  Someone suggested Melatonin, which definitely helped.  But I was still waking up during the night.  The solution?  Valerian Root.  As suggested by my hippie, herbalist mother, Melatonin helps you get to sleep, Valerian Root keeps you asleep.  Both are natural, non-narcotic alternatives to sleep meds, so if you are having issues, try them out.

Exercise:  I used to run 50+ miles per week in high school, and pretty much stopped completely during the 7 years I smoked.  I just got done with a 3.6 mile run and I feel fantastic.  Everything I have read suggested it, and its true.  Exercise really helps manage withdrawal symptoms.  Just pick something you enjoy, because if you have always hated running, quitting nicotine might not change that!

It hasn't been the easiest thing I've done in my life, and I have felt a bit like Jekyll and Hyde at times, but it was ABSOLUTELY worth it.

4 Months Today

I'm a former pack a day smoker who quit cold turkey on the 1st and I'm  so happy to say I haven't smoked in 4 months!  I have a whole box of nicotine gum that I said I would use if necessary but it hasn't been necessary.  I don't mean to denigrate the struggle, because for a lot of people it's definitely real, but this has been so much easier than I anticipated.  

I still think about cigarettes when I'm stressed (hello, finals), but it's more like "oh, I used to smoke, how interesting."  Then I imagine actually inhaling the smoke, the smell of cigarettes on my fingers and breath, and I'm so glad I quit. 

First couple weeks were tough and I gained 10 lbs over the first month.  But I got a fitbit and started running and now I weigh 2 lbs less than I did when I was smoking! 

One of the hardest things for me was meeting smokers at my neighborhood bar and not being instant best friends as we chain smoked and drank outside. I felt like all the cool kids were outside smoking while I had to hang inside with the nerds.  And then I realized I could still go outside. I know that sounds dumb but it was a big relief to know that I could still be social as a nonsmoker - which is ironic because a lot of people think smoking is antisocial behavior. And on the plus side, so many of our (my husband and I quit together) friends have quit smoking in the last few months too! Not saying we're trendsetters but... 

That's all; just wanted to pat myself on the back and let any newly minted non-smokers know that even though it sucks initially, I'm really happy I don't smoke anymore.

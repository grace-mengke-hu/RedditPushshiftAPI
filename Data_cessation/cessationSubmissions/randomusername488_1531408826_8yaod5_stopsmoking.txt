Cotinine Urine Test for Life Insurance

I have a question about a life insurance urine test. I would like to start by saying that I'm not trying to fool the test. I really am quiting (chewing tobacco). My last dip was Saturday June 30th and i had slowed down for the week prior to that. Before that week I would go through 1-2 cans per week. If my Urine test takes place next week, what do you all think my  chances of passing it would be?

Thank you, and if this is an inappropriate question for this subreddit I'd like suggestions to an appropriate one.

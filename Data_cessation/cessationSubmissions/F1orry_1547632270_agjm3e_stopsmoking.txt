How to meet friends that smoke?

Hey everybody! I just quit smoking and now I'm worried what to do when I want to meet with friends as 99% of them are smokers. Most of the time - especially now that it's cold outside - we spent time indoor + smoking. Do you have any advice for me? I feel like asking to not go to smoker's bars or not smoking in their own living rooms is way too much to ask for and quite self-centered.

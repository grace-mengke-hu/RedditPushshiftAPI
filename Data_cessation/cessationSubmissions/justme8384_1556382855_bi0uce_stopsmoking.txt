I really screwed up this time

Need a little encouragement   I starting smoking again after “just one” last weekend. I promised myself everyday that this is the last one but I haven’t had the strength to put them down again. I had 70 days free. I let my friends and family down and I have to quit again. I have made a plan to quit today. Wish me luck.

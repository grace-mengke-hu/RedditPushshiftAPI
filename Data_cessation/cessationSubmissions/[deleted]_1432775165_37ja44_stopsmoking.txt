My Dad's Going to Die and I Don't Know What to do

My Dad had a heart attack today.  Its his third one in 5 years and he continues to smoke.  The doctors have told him that this is a direct cause of mainly his smoking, with his diet being the other reason. He works physically very hard and I really think that is what has kept him alive until now.  He is about 80 pounds overweight at 6'2 and this is due to a very poor diet of mainly meat and carbs along with multiple glasses of pepsi a day.

I feel like I have tried everything and nothing works.  After his last heart attack he tried to quit because he believed he would be dead within the year if he didn't and has since started back up.  He's old school and refuses to read anything so Alan Carr was a bust (it helped me) and none of the nicotine substitutes has had any impact on him.  I am out of ideas and horrified at the thought of losing him without giving it my best try at everything I can think of.  

Do any of you have any experience with someone like this?  Anything You can suggest for someone like this?

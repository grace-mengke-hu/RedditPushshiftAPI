Promised my mom I'd quit before she died. Today my promise begins

I'm one of those people who quits and quits and quits. My mom passed away at the start of march and I promised her that I would quit and mean it this time. In an effort to make it stick I decided to post this so I have some accountability to fall back on if I start trying to justify smoking to myself again.

I'm ready! Don't need luck, just to remember what and why!

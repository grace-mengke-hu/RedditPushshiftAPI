Feeling pretty fucked

I killed my 2.5 month nicotine streak with 2.5 days of smoking last week (over 3.5 days).  It wasn't about smoking, it was about being self-destructive based on being super bitter about the temporary situation I'm in (living in a house mid-renovation without heat and shit), which I think is what scares me the most.  Also, smoking sucked (physically).  I felt like shit in a way I didn't remember feeling like shit when I smoked before.

While I'm back on the horse, my confidence is very low.  I am getting cravings to smoke based on things that have nothing to do with smoking (mainly anger and frustration), and have far more of a fuck-it mentality since I just threw my streak away.  Like, 'what's another day of smoking going to hurt?', even though I know one more day turns into thousands more.

With that said, I know that I have still been de-conditioning myself from smoking and not smokiong for the last couple months so I don't want to act like the relapse ruined/wasted my time smoke free.

I dunno I guess I'm just feeling fucked and worthless and want to bitch about it.  Probably just shitty head space.  Thanks for listening.

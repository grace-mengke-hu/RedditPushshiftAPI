Moody!

Feeling very moody today!! Realised by lunch time I had forgotten to put my patch on, after I’d shouted at literally everyone, took my dogs and kids for a 2hr walk, patch on, still feeling grumpy. Unfortunately for my husband it’s also date night! Luckily going to the cinema so he won’t have to talk to me much!

Starting my journey

So I’m quitting tomorrow and I want to be serious this time. I’ve been smoking for 10 years and I’ve tried to quit multiple times and I want this time to stick. If you don’t see me back on here talking about my progress will everyone do me a favor and ask me what happened and why I went back to that awful habit? It’s going to be a tough journey but I know I can do it. Just need all the encouragement I can get. Also some tips that helped people quit would be great. Thank you! :)

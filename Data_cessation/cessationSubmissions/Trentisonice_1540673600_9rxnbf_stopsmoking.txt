I have gone 2 and a half days vape free.

I have always told myself that if I was not ready to quit I wouldn't. I would need something to replace the addiction. Well fellas I decided to start talking seriously with this girl I like about 2 weeks ago, and Im now on 2 and a half days vape free.

I was able to go out and drink, and see all my friends vape and not want it. I fucking love not needing that flash drive to function hahahaha

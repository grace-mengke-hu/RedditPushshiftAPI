Day three now, goes pretty good

I watched some ted talks about stopping. They where about how to handle cravings. I also carry a pack of cigarettes with me all day. For some reason this helps. This way i wont beg cigarettes from other people ore cant buy them. Makes me feel strong if I just don't smoke them

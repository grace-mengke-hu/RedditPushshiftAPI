Tips to get my parents to stop smoking.

I’ve been trying to get my parents to quit since I was about 13, (I’m 15 now) but nothing seems to be working.  I’ve gone out and gotten those patches to help you stop smoking, that didn’t work.  The older I get the more I worry about their health.  Both of my parents have been smoking for 15+ years, my mom quit for like a week but then went back.  Any tips would help&lt;3

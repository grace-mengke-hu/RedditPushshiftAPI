The Final Cigarette.

I have just finished reading the book. (Well, I listened to the audio book as I went about my day) First of all, I wanted to say that the book was very well done and that I would recommend it to anyone seeking support to kill the addiction. 

I've been smoking for about 10 years. Over this time I've tried to escape numerous times for family, friends and significant others but I've always felt as if I've been "giving up" a part of my life. Over the past few weeks I've been lurking on this sub and I have been overwhelmed by the stories and support that users have shared. The truth is, I am about to "give up" Absolutely nothing. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS REALIZING THIS. I've been ready to let go. I've just been missing the motivation from one person, myself. 

Yesterday I actually finished the book. After I went through rest of the day without one. It wasn't hard. My mind was just clear. I didn't want one. I planned to have my final cigarette this morning with my cup of coffee. (Previously, my most favorite cigarette) At this moment, I am inhaling my final cigarette. Unlike the other moments where I felt this was my "final cigarette". I feel no fear. I feel excited to escape. I never thought I'd feel this way. 

I'm sure my post is just like many on this sub. But I wanted to share this for two reasons. 1) I wanted to put my current thoughts, feelings, and motivation in a medium where I and many others can look back upon. 2) I wanted to contribute to this sub such as many others have. 

I want to thank everyone who has posted on here for indirectly aiding me in this journey. This is day number 1 for me and I couldn't be more excited. As time goes on, I hope that I can contribute and help many others take this leap. I also want to thank everyone for their future support in advanced. 

For the first time in years, I can say with confidence, I am a non smoker.

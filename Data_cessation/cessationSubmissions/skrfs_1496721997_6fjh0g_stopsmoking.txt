Question about smoking

Hey, 

24 year old male, been smoking a half pack to pack a day for 8 years? 

Just read Allen Carr's quit smoking book. Been clean for a day, and pretty confident i'll never smoke again. 

Withdrawals are annoying obviously but i'm using Allen Carr's tactics to overcome them. 

My main problem (that i'm seeing this with forum at least) is people relapsing like 3 years after the fact. Will I never feel like a non smoker? Will I have to deal with the thought of being a smoker forever? 

Advise needed 

Thanks

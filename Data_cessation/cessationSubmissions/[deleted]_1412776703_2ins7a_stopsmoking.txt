Going to stop smoking today.

Ugh. I've been a 1-3 a day/every other day smoker for years now. I used to smoke much more when I was in my 20s (i am 35 now). I have had this habit of buying a pack, smoking a couple of cigs, then throwing the pack out only to buy another pack the next day. I am so fucking sick of this shit. I had a half a cigarette with a coffee this morning and tossed the pack. I've gone weeks without smoking when on vacation, but when I am back home, working, just in my daily grind I've reverted back to the nasty habit. Fuck this shit. I'm done. 


Hm. If I smoked a half a cigarette this morning does today count as day 1? or tomorrow. Hm. Technicalities.


EDIT: I'm going to rant a little bit here. I've been super active and healthy in all other aspects of my life, just haven't been able to impose my will in this department. I would hit the gym, lift, run, used to train in the grappling arts for years and would still indulge in a smoke within an hour of exercise. wtf. damn, it's kinda depressing when I think about it. Damn you nicotine.

I relapsed, now I'm sick

hey all,

I relapsed on cigs last week, I threw the pack away, but had some leftover I smoked through a pipe. Then Friday came around, I got a pack, and pretty much smoked all day Friday/ Saturday almost the whole pack. I pretty much smoked all day. My throat started ithcing on Friday but I thought that was normal. Yesterday I stopped, not smoking, and today I woke up feeling sick. Now I got a feever/ head hurts. I had cig withdrawls before, but no feever. This is maybe a dumb question, but is this most certainly related to the cig consumption? Becuase I was clean of cigs since April...

Almost 3 months cold turkey and fell off the damn bandwagon.

I feel like a failure. I went nearly 3 months without buying a pack of smokes. All it took was depression and a tough week at work and i went back like a moron. I'm gonna toss what's left of this pack. I know i can do it as i did it before but why is this so much harder than anything else I've had to do?

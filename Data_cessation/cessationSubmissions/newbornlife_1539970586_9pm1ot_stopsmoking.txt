Help, Cant go through a single day without a smoke

i've been smoking on and off since I am 20, but most longest off duration about 4 month, sometimes I vaped but always went back to cigarettes.

Now I am 29, I can't even go a single day without lighting up a smoke. 

Currently, I recently graduated with my master's degree and looking for a job but it is not going well. I am in constant state of stress of not working and accumulating interest on my student loan.

I summarized two main reasons I light up after i decide to go smoking. After a few hours, for example, next day from the day I decided to quit, 

1) Cannot initiate any mental/physical labour 
e.g. I cannot start to work on my things or go work out, I keep thinking I need to smoke and start the thing

2) Suicidal/negative thoughts fog my brain so heavily
e.g. I am thinking how quitting smoking can improve my life as I am so behind of everything, all my friends have solid career with some years of experience already, getting married, enjoying life, I just got out of school with no job... There is no point of me quitting cause my life sucks anyway etc...

What should I do... It seems I cant function and my mood is so heavily affected without smoking...

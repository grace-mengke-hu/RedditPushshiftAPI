Spliffs?

I hope this is appropriate to post here.

I started smoking when I was 16 during an exchange year in Italy. It was a Trojan horse situation: basically I was smoking spliffs (weed mixed with tobacco) pretty much daily. I didn't smoke cigarettes, but after a while I could tell I was hooked on tobacco. I started smoking cigarettes a year or two after I came back, was up to a pack a day, and quit 7 months ago (!!!).

Thing is, I'm going back this summer after six years! I'm beyond excited to see all of my friends again after so much time. The problem is, I'm 100% certain they are still smoking spliffs 24/7. I don't think I'll have any problem turning down cigarettes. But I love smoking weed, especially with these people, and I think that will be the problem.

Has anybody had experience with spliffs after quitting? I'll have made it a year by that time, and I don't want to reset my counter. I'm not so concerned by slipping back into old habits, but that could be residual addiction egging me on.

Also: they are (generally) not fans of straight weed and I've seen them not smoke just because there's no tobacco to mix in.

Day 0

Why am I so scared to leave my shitty comfort zone? To leave behind a habit that I know is unhealthy and a waste of money and time? Why am I afraid to move forward? Why do I choose to procrastinate day after day, week after week? 

I quit for the first half of this year and know the benefits far outweigh any initial distress or discomfort. And yet I continue to put off quitting again. 

I'm sick of this drug. Sick of this habit. Sick of addiction and feeling like a slave.

I want to move forward. Be disciplined, healthy, happy and confident. I no longer what to be held back by this shitty habit. It's time to let go, and yet I continue to delay.

Day 0.

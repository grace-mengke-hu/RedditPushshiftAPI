4 months and all's good but firsts still bother me a little.

This weekend I fired up the fire pit to burn up a bunch of branches. First time out there since I quit smoking and it was bugging me quite a bit. I kept busy and had some beer.
This morning I had to drop someone off at the air port. After I dropped them off it hit me that this is the first time I've been to the air port since I quit. 
I'll eventually run out of firsts, I'm looking forward to that.

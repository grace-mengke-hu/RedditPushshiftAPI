How can i stop my boyfriend to stop smoking?

I know him for 3 months and he only used to smoke when he was going out with his friends and he told me he wont start smoking seriously, but since he started going to work he smokes everyday like 8-9 cigarettes, and it bothers me because I care about his health and I don't want him to get to smoke a pack a day.

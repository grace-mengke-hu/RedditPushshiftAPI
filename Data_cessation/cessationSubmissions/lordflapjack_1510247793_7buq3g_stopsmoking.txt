Reaching difficult part of quit (3-4 weeks), need help from experienced quitters

I'm at 21 days today, and the longest i've been without smoking is about a month or 30-ish days.

I keep having a really hard time with this part of my quit. It's almost like every day I think about smoking when a week ago I could go days without thinking about it. I get really jealous at other smokers and I think about how easy it would be to bum one. I keep thinking I can just have one today and then quit again tomorrow but I don't want to lose my streak :/

I feel like there is no point to quitting, i've already achieved many of the improvements to my health. My boyfriend who is my main reason to quit notices less and asks me less about how I am doing. We got in a fight a few days ago and he told me to go smoke and it's made it very difficult. 

Coming up on a month I just think about 2 months, 3 months, 6 months and its just feels like forever vs 2 days 5 days 10 days. I don't know if anyone else has experienced this difficulty at a month but I would love some advice.

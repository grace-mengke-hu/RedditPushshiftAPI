Slipped after a week

I went six days. I'd been smoking a pack a day for over 10 years. My gf and I tried to quit together. I made it 6 days, and I was doing okay, but the stresses added up and I went and bought a pack. I feel pretty shitty about it, but I threw the pack out after smoking two. I kinda feel like I let her down, and she was kind of upset. But I'm going to give it another go. I have to do this. 

Can I just reset the badge? Or do I need to remove and then request a new one?

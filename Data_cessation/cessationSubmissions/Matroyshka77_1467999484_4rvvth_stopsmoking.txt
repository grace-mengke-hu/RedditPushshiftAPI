Day one

I've been dealing with my stress by smoking for a few weeks now. Constantly trying to quit. Today I was smoking and didn't even enjoy it. Using the smoke free app- must have tried 15 or 20 times.  Today threw away about 8 cigarettes (which I've done before) and tonight is my first real test as I always smoke at night.  I stopped my exercise routine because I'm constantly smoking. I also need to quit for other reasons.  I stopped cold turkey for 2 years before till a death in family in sept.  The longest I've stopped since then is 2 months.  Recently just 48 hours. 
I started smoking in the morning lately. 
I came on really to ask people's tips for other things to relax me / is it just a myth that it helps you relax to smoke? Thanks!

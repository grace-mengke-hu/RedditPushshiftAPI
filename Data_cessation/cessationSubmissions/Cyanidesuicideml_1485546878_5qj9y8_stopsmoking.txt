Help

I have to quit smoking for surgery . My husband doesn't really care to encourage me. I'm trying the slowly go off, breaking the habit type thing. His Idea of helping me,  is just not buy cigs. Due to my disability I don't work.  So I have no money of my own but a few dollars.  I am tired of fighting. He doesn't understand that I've smoked for over 20 years and it's not something that you can just put down and walk away from.  I so want to quit but encouragement and support are something that helps! He won't even tell me " you can do it". Let alone get patched or gum or something.  I am scared I won't be able to stop. That I won't get the surgery I need to save my arm.

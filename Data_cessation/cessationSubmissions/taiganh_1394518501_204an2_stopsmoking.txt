Getting off of Champix? [40 days]

Hey guys!

I've smashed through the month mark and even though I still have occasional cravings, I owe a lot of my success to Champix.

But it's making me really sick. I haven't slept properly in weeks (weird dreams are definitely a thing), the nausea is constant, and I've experienced a few lapses in memory or audio/visual hallucinations.

I'm currently taking antidepressants and was hoping I wouldn't have side effects from the Champix as I'd managed to be okay for the most part until now.



Has anyone been in a similar situation? 

What's the withdrawal of Champix like? 

What can I do to move from Champix, and what can I change to in order to keep quitting?

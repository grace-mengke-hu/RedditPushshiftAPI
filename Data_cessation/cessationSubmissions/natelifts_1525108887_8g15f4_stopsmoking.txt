Really bad depression since quitting smoking. Is this normal?

Hello r/stopsmoking. it's been about two weeks since i've quit nicotine (vaping) at the request of my loved ones and since then it's definitely not been an easy task. The first few days weren't bad, i did feel more easily stressed out and more agitated/aggressive but honestly nothing that i couldn't handle in my opinion. 

After the first initial days of quitting smoking, however, i've gotten into a DEEP depression. i don't think i've ever felt this depressed for absolutely no reason in a long while. 

Is this normal?? i've been running and exercising, as well as eating healthier, which does help and make me feel more "okay," the day that i do it but if i miss a run, or not exercise that day i feel depressed as all hell. and i mean like crying, feeling helpless and broken level of depressed. 

I can't feel like this forever because it will interfere with my work performance and potentially put me at risk of losing my job. I need to know if this feeling gets better soon, because i fear that if i don't feel better sooner, i will resort to smoking again. 

For those who are going to tell me to seek out medical help instead of asking reddit - i already have an appointment with my doctor scheduled. just seeking opinions from fellow redditors to see if this feeling is normal, if others have gotten over feeling depressed from quitting smoking, and what things have helped, etc.

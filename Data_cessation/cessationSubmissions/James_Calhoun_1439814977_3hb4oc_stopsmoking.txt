Slipped up

So I slipped up a few weeks ago. Bought a pack of Luckies. I regret it. I'm looking to get back on the wagon and try again, but I'm anxious I will fail again. It feels like I've proven to myself that I'm not "able" to stop. Looking for advice/expierence of fellow quitters who've made another attempt and succeeded.

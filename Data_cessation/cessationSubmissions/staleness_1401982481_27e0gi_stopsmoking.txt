6 months today!

It's been 6 months to this day that I quit smoking, and nothing - absolutely nothing - feels better than this. 

I started smoking 'socially', that is, when I was drinking with friends. That got fairly regular, and soon, I was smoking when I was on my own. 6 months ago today, I was sitting at my desk and I decided to quit just to see if I could. 

And hells yeah, I could, and I did. 

Things in my life have fallen into place since I quit. The very fact that I was not smoking anymore gave me the motivation to start working out too - "just to see if I could". I'm healthier and happier now, and it's only going to get better. 

Keep your head up if you've just quit. You've got a long way, and it's worth every step.

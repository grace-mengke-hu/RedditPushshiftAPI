Cleaning up cravings after not smoking

I live in an apartment building with two neighbors who smoke and have smoked indoors for the last ten years they have lived here. The stairwell stinks like an ashtray and I gag anytime I leave or enter my apartment. If my dow stairs neighbor leaves his door open, the smoke smell creeps into my house through my closet. 

When I did smoke indoors, it was on my enclosed porch. Now that I no longer smoke and I go out on the porch to have my coffee or do work, after about an hour cravings come back full tilt.

Does anyone have that similar experience? Did you clean the area where you smoked once you stopped? To what extent should I clean it? Do I need to put bleach on the walls? How do I block unwanted smoke from entering my home? 

I've been on Chantix for two months, but completely smoke-free for two days. No, I won't move because I can afford to live here and not much else is available at my income level.

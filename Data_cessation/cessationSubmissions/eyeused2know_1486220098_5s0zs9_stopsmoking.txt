Do people read posts or only titles? Is this truly a good place to get support?

I had posted a question 2 days ago. This was regarding the physical w/d effects of a smoking 1 cigarette on day 4 of my quit. 

I made no excuses for my mistake & vowed to myself that I would not allow that to happen again. 

Only one response I received brought me some comfort, the rest invoked guilt. That was in no way help for me. 

The question was "will one cigarette put me back to day one of the PHYSICAL WITHDRAWAL?" 

I believe this answer could be helpful to many, if they can see that a single slip up can be overcome. 

It has been 48 smoke free hours since I made that mistake. 

Can r/stopsmoking offer me the support and encouragement I need?

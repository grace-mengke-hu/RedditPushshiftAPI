December 1st is my quit date.

I plan on quitting on Monday, December 1st! I started smoking when I was 19, and ended up quitting when I was 28 years old, for 4 years! I was doing so well, I swore to myself that I would never start again.

Next thing you know, I'm 32 years old and at my grandfathers funeral, and decided it wouldn't be so bad if I had just 1 cigarette. My grandfather smoked for 70 years (started when he was 12 years old and smoked until the day he died at 82) and I guess it reminded me of him. It's no excuse, but I know that's when I started smoking again.

4 years later (as of October 10th), and I'm still smoking a pack a day.

My entire life changed when I quit smoking the first time. I started working out regularly, and went from smoking a pack a day and not exercising a day in my life, to working out religiously and running 5 miles a day. I went from 285 pounds down to 190 pounds, and quitting smoking was the catalyst for all of it. My healthy obviously went up tremendously, I started eating healthier because I didn't want to waste all the hard work I put in at the gym, and people started treating me differently. All of a sudden I went from working nights as a taxi dispatcher from 11 PM to 7 AM, to my current role as an IT director for an online fashion company. 

Once I started smoking again, everything went to shit. I stopped working out and packed on another 50 pounds. I'm not as heavy as I was originally, but I'm still incredibly unhappy with the way I look and feel. My knees hurt, my back hurts, and mentally I'm just not happy anymore. 

So, it's time to quit once again. It's just not worth it. Not only will it save me a ton of money, but my entire life will be changed for the better once again.

Let's quit guys. I don't want to be a slave to my addiction anymore.

This picture is a direct result of me quitting smoking the first time. 1 year after I quit smoking, this is what changed. 285 pounds down to 195. In this picture I was 210, I put a few pounds back on because I was too skinny, and my head was too big for my body :)

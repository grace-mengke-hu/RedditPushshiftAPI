I lost my first bout

I finished reading Allan Carr's Easyway and actually felt really positive about it. 
Today I decided that the morning cig would be the last one as talked about in the book. 
I smoked it, while thinking and analyzing how shitty it was to smoke a cig. After throwing the smoked butt, I told myself that "I'm a non smoker now". 
After 6 hours, I don't know what happened. I wasn't getting the cravings as I was really positive in my mind. I was really fine but still I went and had one. 
Out of shame, I purchased the Marlboro Lights cause "Less nicotine". (We are able to purchase lose cigarettes in our country, although it's banned). 

I feel really terrible.

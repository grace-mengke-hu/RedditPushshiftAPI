How to say BYE to your smoking persona?

So I'm 3 days, 19 hours smoke free.  Last night was a big night for me - I shared the news with two very close friends.

See, I've been holding this deep dark secret for many years.  No one new I smoked.  They were shocked.

But it feels good to shine a light on that deep dark secret because I want to stop.  Sharing that secret with my friends is proving to myself that I am serious about quitting.

The challenge I have had is to let my old persona go.  

Question to all: Cravings aside, was it hard "letting go" of that side of your personality that indulged in smoking?  Do you miss the "me" time?

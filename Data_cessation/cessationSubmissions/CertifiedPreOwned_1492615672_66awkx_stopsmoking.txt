Weening off or quitting cold turkey

Has anyone had more success than the other? I need to quit due to the desire to start a family and I'm needing advice. I smoke about a pack a day. Is it better to cut my intake every few days or just quit? I quit before for about 6 months cold turkey and it didn't last. Any advice or friendly words of encouragement would be appreciated.

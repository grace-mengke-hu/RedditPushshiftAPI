I want to start smoking... Hear me out

OK before you get mad and tell me to gtfo, please hear me out.

I never smoked before, not once in my life. No weed, no cigarettes, no e-cigs etc. However I'm at a very bad time in my life, and I need something to distract/ease me as needed. 

Out of all the bad habits I could develop (gambling, drinking, etc.) I feel smoking is the best one. 

However, I really don't want to smoke real cigarettes or anything too addictive. Weed isn't an option either because I have issues with memory and concentration as is. I'm hoping one of you know of a good "fake" smoking alternative? Like idk, gathering some dried lavender leaves and smoking that or something. 

I feel like this is the best sub to ask because you guys know exactly what you're doing when it comes to smoking, quitting, and alternatives. 

Any other suggestions are also welcome. Thanks

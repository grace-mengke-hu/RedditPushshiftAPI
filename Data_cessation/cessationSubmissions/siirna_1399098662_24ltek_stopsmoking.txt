My 100 days

At first, I *knew* this was going to be hard.  I now know this to be foolish.  
  
I used to worry about what could trigger a craving, seeing packs in the stores I have to go to.  I learned to stop worrying.  
  
How? 
  
I made a simple choice, to not do something.  By choosing to not do something so simple I have opened many doors for myself.  I have found strength in what one simple decision can make.  
  
I hope my perspective can provide support for anyone going through doubts right now. Take care all out there, but you don't need luck.  Luck is unnecessary when there is control to take.

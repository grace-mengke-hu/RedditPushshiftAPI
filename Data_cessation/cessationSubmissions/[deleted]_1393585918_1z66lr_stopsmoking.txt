How can I help my SO understand what it's like to quit smoking?

Last night was my first night without cigarettes. It was Hell, but I did it. I definitely got a little hyper emotional and moody towards the end of the night. While I accept responsibility for that (and I did apologize), my SO admitted that he didn't understand why quitting smoking would put me on edge or why it's so difficult. I don't know how to explain to him how I physically or mentally felt last night. I don't know how to articulate what makes this seem so impossible at times. I was hoping a few of you could help by posting your experiences? Or anything else that might help him empathize?

Which app do you all use? Also, I kinda hate myself @8 days

Tried to TL;DR in title. Which app are you all sharing screenshots? I have two and they are both not super helpful. 

Also I’m either 8 days or 9 days, 4 hours and 12 minutes smoke free, and this is super difficult guys. I want a cigarette so desperately, and have been wanting a smoke for so many days, that I’m about to drive to the corner store. Help me not do that. This sucks right now.

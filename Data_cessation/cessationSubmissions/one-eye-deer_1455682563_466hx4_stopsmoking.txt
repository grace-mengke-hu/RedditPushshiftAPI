43 days in, and almost $250 saved. Also made it through a tough night last night!

If you need motivation to get through the cravings, average out how much you were spending on cigarettes per week, and multiply your weeks without smoking by that number.

I was easily spending $30-$40/week on cigarettes, and that also doesn't include the extra gas I was buying for my long drives (I rarely smoked outside, and it became a bad habit to go on long drives every day to smoke). 

I also had a very stressful night last night, and normally I would have reached for my pack, gone on a long drive, and chain smoked for a half hour. Made it through that stressor without caving in, and the thought of smoking only briefly entered my mind right at the end. I'd say that's another victory for me!

5 pack years since 14, what have I done. Getting freaked out

I'm starting to get paranoid since life is getting a bit better. I used to smoke about 1 stick a day when I was 14 and it accumulated, by the time I was in 3rd year HS I started to smoke 1 - 2 packs a day making up for the less than a pack days. 

Is the damage to my lungs reversible? Is it severe? (I can't calculate it cause, most websites say that your risk before 40 isn't accurate) Help I'm getting paranoid. I don't want to die in my 20s - 30s just when my life is starting to get easy.

Also I'm trying to convince my mom that an e-cig is a viable option. She said the nicotine will still cause damage to my health, I said it was the tar in the cigs and etc. Are e-cigs relatively safe? Not including malfunction that it blows up on your face (like in the news in our local network)

3 weeks! Haven't touched one!

I am making it all the way this time.  This is officially the longest I've ever quit and I feel awesome.  I do all the things I used to do as a smoker except smoke! I have been using an alternative thc pen that has helped but I don't find it to be necessary.  I had a super traumatic experience a week ago but didn't even think about having a smoke.  It's possible! You just need to believe!!!!

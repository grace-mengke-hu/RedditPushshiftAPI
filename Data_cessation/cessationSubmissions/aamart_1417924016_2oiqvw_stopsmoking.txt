More difficult on the weekends?

I felt pretty good about things during the week but today has been much more difficult.  Tomorrow my wife works all day, there will be football on, and I don't have to work or have any significant plans. How do you deal with days like that? Part of me already feels like I'm going to go get a pack and smoke like crazy and I can just start over on Monday.. which I realize is a horrible stupid plan. Ugh!

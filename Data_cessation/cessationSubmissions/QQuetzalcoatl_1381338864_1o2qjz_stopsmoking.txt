DAY 7 gogo

I start day 7 much like I started day 6, I quit a week ago on accident really. I got the flu that was going around town so naturally I just didn't smoke for the rest of that day and the next. When I felt better I just decided fuck it lets see what happens.


I've quit before in the same fashion but it usually only lasts a couple weeks/months. I just don't remember coughing so goddamn much though- and THE FLEM! I am really sick of dripping tabs of lung butter off my tongue every few minutes, but its really comforting knowing that it is no longer inside me. 


My friend's wedding was over the weekend and that was pretty tough not to smoke, luckily my work had a sale on e-cigs that saved me from that (I use Blu). I got pretty inebriated and watched my gf smoke and gave into a couple drags. BUT the best part is it tipped me off the deep end and I ended up vomiting in the damn bathroom! 


Staring into that bowl of yellow-green+brown clouds I had a revelation- I need to be a more healthy person, starting with quitting cigs. I already bike everywhere I go so that helps, but my stomach had also been giving me lots of problems for a while (heartburn, indigestion, upset stomach, etc) but now... gone! Even went to the doctor and they just wanted to bleed me dry on tests but now I feel completely fine. FUCK YEA


Let's see how long I can take it this time.

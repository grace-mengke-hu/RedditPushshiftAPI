I thought this subreddit was *so* corny...

...but after spending some time here I'm now at 100 days smoke-free, after several failed attempts! Not only did I quit, but I slowly convinced my SO to quit as well. I dealt with him smoking around me, friends smoking around me, moments of insanity. Each time I'd come here, read some posts of encouragement, and I haven't slipped up once. I feel like a nonsmoker. So, thanks /r/stopsmoking. I'm sorry I ever thought this place was silly. <3

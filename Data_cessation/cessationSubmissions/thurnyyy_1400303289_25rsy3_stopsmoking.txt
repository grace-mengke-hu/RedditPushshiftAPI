5 days in and feeling really sad and down. Any help would be great.

Hey guys, I could really use some support. I'm about 5 days in quitting smoking about 4 cigs a day and vaping the rest of the time. I've been okay for the most part, had a night where i was very drunk and didn't smoke or vape a thing.

I've been getting weird waves of anxiety, have noticed i wake up a lot while i sleep, and will get sad for no reason at all.

Since i've quit i've been in the gym almost every day, so i'm wondering if it's a mix of withdrawal, exhaustion, etc...

It sucks to feel sad for no reason. 

Any advice would be great.

Thanks!

I think I can be go back to the old me again

Been smoking for 4 years. Gradually increased from one cigarette a week 4 years ago to 1 pack a day last year. Tried to quit in the middle, but once I see someone else smoke or get into a bad situation I couldn't help it. 

A week ago I realized I was depressed, and that I've been depressed for about a year. That's probably the main reason for all the sticks I burnt through. I suddenly wanted to be who I was 4 years ago, when I used to admonish my friends who smoked. And last week I decided it was time to blow away this filthy habit. 

It's been 10 days since I smoked. Roommates had a party at home tonight. Booze & Cigarettes were there as well. But they didn't bother me. I knew if I drank I'd smoke, and then that would be the end of it. All the while I just kept reminding myself what I wanted to be, that I won't let a 5 inch cylindrical paper control me, and just like that I got through the party. I really think I can beat this now. Just going to keep pushing, and resisting the urge, hoping that one day it'd disappear.

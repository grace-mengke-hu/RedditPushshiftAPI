Been tempted to try an ecig even though I quit several years ago

Just wanted to rant. Been stressed and e cig shops are suddenly popping up everywhere in my relatively small town. Like... what the fuck. There's at least 4, including some dude who sets up shop in a truck outside the local Big Lots. I'm always so tempted. I've seen some at gas stations too...

My dad is a chain smoker and I spend a lot of time around him, that certainly doesn't help things. I'm a skincare junkie, which was my biggest reason for quitting. (Got my first wrinkle and kinda freaked out haha)

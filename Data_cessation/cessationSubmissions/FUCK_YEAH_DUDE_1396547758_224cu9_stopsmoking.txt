Can we collect a group of verified resources on the negative effects of smoking?

Sup dudes. So I only smoked for like 4 or 5 months and now I've quit (last cigarette hopefully ever was yesterday morning).

I have been seriously sobered on cigarettes by reading up on just how bad cigarettes are for you and I feel like that knowledge is some of the best motivation there is. It is seriously *fucking insane* how bad cigarettes are for you, and I want no part of that shit.

So please, let's all contribute some **legitimate** resources of health facts related to smoking/quitting smoking. 

I'll contribute [THIS FACT SHEET](http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/health_effects/effects_cig_smoking/) from the Center for Disease Control. I was absolutely floored by this. I mean everybody knows cigarettes are "bad for you", but when you see it all written out and not only how severe the risks are but the sheer volume of risks is enough to voip these shit sticks out of my hands forever. 

Let's get some friggin science in here.

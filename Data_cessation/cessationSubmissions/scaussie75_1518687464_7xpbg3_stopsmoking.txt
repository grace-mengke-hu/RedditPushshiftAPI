When do the cravings stop? Day 12

Hi,
Probably being impatient, I'm on day 12 smoke free and week 8 of champix. 20 years a smoker. 
Physical cravings gone, habitual cravings manageable but still hard, psychological fear cravings strong. 
I was just wondering when the habitual and fear cravings go. 

I know that although I m smoke free, I won't feel like a non smoker until these thoughts go too.

How are all the New Year Resolution Quitters getting on?

I hadn't really planned on it in advance, just realised I was going to run out round about New year's morning. Ended up having my last when I got up on New year's Day, put a patch on, and have just hit 24 hours.

I'm going to do it this time, I'm determined. And stubborn. I always said I'd give up by the time I was 30, and guess what age I turn this year? Started when I was 15 so almost half my life.

Having said that, yesterday was a bit of a soft start. New Year's Day is still a bit of a party day where I live (the 2nd is even a holiday). After a few drinks, I had a few puffs of a friend's last night. Thankfully I'd already been intending to do a dry January (not counting the 1st), so I know that getting drunk can't be an excuse again for the next few weeks.

So I'm rambling now because I've just had a bit of a craving. 

Good luck to you all!

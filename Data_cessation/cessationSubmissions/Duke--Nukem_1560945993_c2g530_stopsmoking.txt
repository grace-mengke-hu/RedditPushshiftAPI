Is smoking anything but tobacco is still smoking?

1 month 4 days since the last cigarette. But!! Smoking sage (Salvia officinalis L.) has been a great help to be honest.



I smoked 3 to 4 sage cigarettes at the beginning but now I smoke only like 3 or 4 puffs a day. More if I am smoking.


I am aware that I am using it as a substitute and that at some point I will have to stop but is this still considered smoking?


Personnaly, after being a smoker for +15 years, not smoking cigarettes is a big win. Being able to feel free from cigarettes has no price.


Anyone with similar experience?

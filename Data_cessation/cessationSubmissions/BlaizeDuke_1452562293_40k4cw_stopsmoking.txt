I just extinguished my final cigarette.

So the idea behind quitting this time came from my dad who is almost at 2 years smoking-free after smoking for 40+ years. He challenged my entire family to do it and offered us a monetary reward if we could get to where he was. 

At first it was about the money, but I set a date (January 11, 2016) and started doing research on methods to quit. Allen Carr's book kept coming up on my research so I picked up a copy and proceeded to read it with the idea that January 11 would be the day I finished the book and smoke my last cigarette. 

Well the day is here, and I couldn't care less about the reward my dad offered at this point. I'm excited to experience life as a non-smoker once again (something I haven't done in 10 years.) 

The most important thing I realized that has gotten me as excited as I am is that I am not "quitting" smoking, I'm "ESCAPING" smoking and I couldn't be happier with my decision.

So January 11, 2016 is going to be one of the most important days of my life and I'm excited about what the future holds.

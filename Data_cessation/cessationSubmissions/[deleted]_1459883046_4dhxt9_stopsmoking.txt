Holy cow! £5K!!!

Sat down with my husband and worked out how much money we are collectively saving now that we've quit smoking and moved some of our utilities to different suppliers. It's £5000 a year!!! This is bloody amazing and so liberating - we might even get a holiday some time soon for the first time in years! Why didn't we do this sooner?!

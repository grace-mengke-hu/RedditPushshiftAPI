Nicotine free for 1 month and 16 days

Hi everyone.

I have now been smoke and nicotine free for 1 month and 16 days. Life is good, with all its' up and downs, but at least I don't smoke. I quit cold turkey together with my girlfriend and we have just been pushing against the cravings and all that follows together.

It is not my first (far from it) quit, but it is my second quit which has lasted for more than two weeks.

I am not sure what to say. Despite not smoking, some health stuff can still be bothersome, but it is much, much better. Cravings? I get them, but they are much more managable, so much so, that I am confused if it even counts as a craving, or if it is just some weird thought. I dream about smoking some. It's very weird.

I'd say that as a smoker, I was in the "I want to quit"-stage from quiet early on, and I smoked for about 5 years. I despised smoking - and I still do today. Not sure what you want to pull from that, but there you go.

Feel free to ask any questions, if you have any. Otherwise, best of luck to you all. I will be desubscribing for now, seeing as I don't feel that I am struggling with smoking anymore. Thank you for your support (I was mostly lurking, but your posts put some perspective to my own experience and for that I am grateful).

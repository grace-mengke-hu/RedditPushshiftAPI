Why do I fear quitting smoking?

The title speaks for itself. I was driving today and I've tried to quit a few times before, however I came across a thought that I actually feared quitting... What's up with that?

Several things come across my mind with regards to the fear. I fear the cravings. I fear failure again. I fear the impact it will have on my relationship with my GF who also smokes. Thoughts?

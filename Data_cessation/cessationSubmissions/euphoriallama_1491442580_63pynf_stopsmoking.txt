What do you do when you're angry with someone and you want to smoke because I'm about to cave

Having an argument with a loved one over text—it is, of course, a recurring argument so I'm furious as usual because it's a pattern—and I really want to smoke because that's what I usually do to take some mental space / calm down / get my bearings / whatever. I tried to quit before and gave in at the 2-week point for the same reason. Please help me not give in tonight. Thanks.

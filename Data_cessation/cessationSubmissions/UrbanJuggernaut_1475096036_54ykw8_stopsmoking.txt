Attempting to quit for the second time, looking for any free resources.

Hey all, discovered this sub today and have been mulling over the idea of quitting. I'm 24 and have been smoking for 8 years. I'm mostly quitting for financial reasons, but being healthier is a nice bonus. I had been very successful weening myself off them before, got down to 3 a day from a pack, but relapsed after a drunken night. Wish me luck!

Am I the only with the irrational fear of..

I know I cannot be the only person with the irrational fear of quitting. I know the only thing I have to gain is a better life. However, the fear of not having the emotional crutch to goto when I am angry or upset scares me. I am also afraid of my attitudes towards my family, friends, and co-workers while I am in the process of quitting. Can someone please share with me their stories of quitting? What the first couple of weeks were like? How I can help get over the emotional fears of it.

Did anybody get sick from quitting?

I have been off cigarettes since the 25th of December after getting a bad chest infection on the 23rd (I quit on the 23rd but snuck one on Christmas night).

Anyways this morning I woke up and my head is hurting bad. I feel dizzy and when I try to stand up I feel weak.

Anyone else get this or should I maybe go to the doctors. :D

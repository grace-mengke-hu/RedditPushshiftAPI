Day 1.... wish me luck guys...

Hey non-smokers! Finally decided to make a serious go of it! I've been smoking since I was 17 (26 now) and enough is enough. I've had tooth problems (at least partially because of smoking), and I'm a type 2 diabetic. I'm using the patch among other psychological methods. Any tips, advice, or encouragement would really help me out!



Edit: wow, thanks for all the responses! Feels good to know I'm not alone in the struggle.

I did it

And i can't say it's too tough. Been smoking for 3 years, but last half a year i really don't like my sigs anymore. I smoked them reluctantly and last friday i was at the train station with a friend and at once i decided to throw away the tobacco i got with me and quit. And so it happened. Feeling good and bad the same time, please /r/stopsmoking - keep me on track :)

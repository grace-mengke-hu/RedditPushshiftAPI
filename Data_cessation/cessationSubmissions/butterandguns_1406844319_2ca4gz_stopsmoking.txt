Day 2 after smoking everyday for 14 years.

I'm 32. Been smoking since I was 18. I'm not feeling great. Not bad enough to really smoke right now, but still not great. In other news, for the first time in I don't know how long I didn't spend my entire morning routine coughing and spitting. 

I've never quit before so hopefully this doesn't fail.

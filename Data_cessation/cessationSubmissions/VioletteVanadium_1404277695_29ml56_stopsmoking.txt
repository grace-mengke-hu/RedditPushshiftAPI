Today is the day.

I just threw away the rest of my pack, something I've never been able to do before. The other times I've quit, I waited until the end of the pack, but there is something different about actively disposing of them that I've never been able to do before. I would just like to thank everyone here for providing me with motivation and a sense that I'm not alone in this. Wish me luck!

This is how it feels to crave a cigarette

Hello everyone, I'm beginning the hustle of quitting. Among many other habits I have been trying to get commited to instead of smoking, recording and messing around editing videos is one of them, so I can keep up and make something out of my own progress. I tried to generate an experience that might provoke a similar feeling to the one I have when craving a cigarette. Hope it is enjoyed. The struggle is real!

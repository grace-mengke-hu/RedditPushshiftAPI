Threw out my pack three days ago... this is hard

I started smoking when I was 15. It used to be a social thing. A pack a month at most. By the time I was 21 it was half a pack a day. I’m now 23 and I was almost up to a pack a day last year. The past few months I cut down to two packs a month but I realized I needed to totally quit. It’s bad for my health, my insurance rates are $50 more a month when I smoke, it’s expensive, and I don’t get anything out of it. 

That being said going out with friends to a bar is such a trigger for me. I want to go out so badly for a cigarette after a beer or two. It’s a nice break, I’ve made many friends out socializing while smoking, and I just crave it so viscerally.

I want to stick with quitting. It has been a bit over 3 days now and I still keep thinking about buying a pack. Why do I like smoking so much? I never even like it that much beyond the first drag when I’m doing it but whenever I haven’t had one in a while I just want one so bad. 

Sorry this was long and rambly. I just want to be done with these stupid things.

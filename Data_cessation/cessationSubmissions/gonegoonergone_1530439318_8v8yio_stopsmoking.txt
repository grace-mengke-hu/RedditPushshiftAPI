Anyone feel anger and rage at things that really didn’t annoy you before?

I’ve quit smoking for a month now. I’ve noticed that I have a lot less patience. Like little things that didn’t irritate me before, or didn’t irritate me as much are now setting me off. It’s fucking annoying. Like I know I shouldn’t be in such a foul mood but I just am. I try to exercise when I’m in such a funk but sometimes you’re just not in a place to exercise. Like right now, I got ticked off cause I had to wait 15 minutes for a bus ticket and got a ticket to a later bus which leaves half an hour later. No biggie. But I’m in such a foul mood. Like my girlfriend called and she’s all excited to see me and I’m just not feeling it at all and ruining her vibe cause of this stupid anger/rage. Any similar experiences? Advice? Tips?

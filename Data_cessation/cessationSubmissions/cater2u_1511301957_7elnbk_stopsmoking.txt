Haven't smoked in 1.5-2 weeks? Honestly been so long I don't remember. But randomly started craving. Is this withdrawal or is this something else?

Haven't smoked in forever and haven't craved. But yesterday, I just keep thinking about smoking. Today, too. I am stressed so maybe this is my body's understanding of dealing with stress? Smoking? Or is this a withdrawal symptom? I don't know. This is just me rambling.

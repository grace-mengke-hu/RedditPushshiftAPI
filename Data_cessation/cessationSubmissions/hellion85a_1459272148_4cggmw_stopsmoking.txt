Benedryl (OTC) possible smoking cessation aid?

So one day I was thinking about possible ways to quit smoking. Knowing that smoking increases acetylcholine  and knowing of the common anticholinergic Bendryl (Diphenhydramine); trying a standard dose took the cravings and edge away from smoking every 4 -5 hours. Especially in the beginning. It does seem to work. Below I have provided some citations. 

Here is a study that shows that scopolamine works, which is a common anticholinergic .

Anyway to show that Benedryl (Diphenhydramine) is an anticholinergic, like scopolamine, here is proof..

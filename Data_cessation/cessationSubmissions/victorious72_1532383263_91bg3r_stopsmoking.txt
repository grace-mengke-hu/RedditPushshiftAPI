Keep it up - you can do it!

Have just popped by because I’ve made it a year without smoking! Gave up on my son’s 5th birthday and now he’s 6 and I’m a non smoker.

I found it really really shitty to start with and even now I have moments when I really could smoke but on balance it was the best decision I’ve ever made. The improvements to my life are almost infinite and it’s worth every struggle and hard time I had along the way.

Day 13!

I have literally been nothing but miserable for the last 13 days. I was excited and confident to quit but weirdly enough as soon as I did quit I just started screaming internally and didn’t stop. The entire time I knew that smoking wasn’t worth it, it was all in my head, and I stayed determined that I was going to succeed, but that didn’t stop me from hating it. But then I woke up today and it was just all kind of gone! I’m in a good mood, the cravings are easy and I’m finally not miserable. I wouldn’t say I’m “happy” that I quit yet, but I just don’t really care. What a weird experience! 

For anyone thinking of quitting, it really is all about your attitude going into it! If I wasn’t so confident that I could quit when I went into this, I would have just given in to the misery.

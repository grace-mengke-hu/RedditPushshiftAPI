Look at that pretty star!

It's been a month! I have had a lot of times where I wanted to pick up a smoke during stressful times, but I reminded myself that it's not going to help the situation. The most amazing aspect of it all is being able to smell and taste properly again! Next step is to start working out again, and for once not being out of breath!

Thank you for all the support you guys have offered!

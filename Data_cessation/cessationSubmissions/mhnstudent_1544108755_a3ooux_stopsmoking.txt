The Day 5 struggle..

I’m just here for a rant/maybe some motivation to keep going? 

Day 5 of no cigarettes and I want to rip my own throat out to stop it scratching. The first 1 to 3 days I thought I was bossing it, it was so much easier than all the other times I’ve tried to quit before. But now I want to kill someone. 
My car is broken down so I cannot physically get to the shops, but now I’m seriously considering spending £20 in a taxi just to get a packet of Ambers, how ridiculous is that. I’m convinced if I had a working car I’d already be smoking again. 
Why is Day 5 harder than day 2/3? I thought when the nicotine was gone from your system it would just magically be easier.

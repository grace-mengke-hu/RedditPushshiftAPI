The nic pangs are pretty strong

Every time I try to quit, I get your usual nicotine pangs. I've been trying to quit using Allen Carr's method (which at first worked wonders then I got really dumb on the 9th day), and it says that nicotine withdrawal is very mild. But after 10 hours or so I start feeling all my muscles tightening up, it's really unpleasant. Eventually I cave because of this feeling, since the nicotine instantly relieves that "pain".

Another way to describe it - when you have a cold or the flu and you get shivers. I usually feel that tight sensation in my legs.

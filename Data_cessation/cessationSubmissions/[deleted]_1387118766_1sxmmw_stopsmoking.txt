OK, I stopped smoking 5 days ago and going strong, but I have some concerns...

So I went from smoking a pack a day to zero/null/nothing. I feel pretty good and I wasn't seriously tempted until now.

I always used smoking as an ice breaker; be it just talking to a pretty girl or introducing myself to someone on a business meeting. Now, I have a serious concern that I would relapse if I get into such social gatherings. In fact, I didn't go out yesterday, even though I had arranged to go to a concert with my friends.

I'm pretty happy that I gave up this filthy habbit but I fear that my social life will suffer because of it. Any suggestions?

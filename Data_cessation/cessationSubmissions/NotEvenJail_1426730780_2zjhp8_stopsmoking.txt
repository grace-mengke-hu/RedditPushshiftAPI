If you have stopped smoking cigarettes but still vape (with nicotine in the juice), does that qualify as "quitting smoking"?

I quit smoking real cigs a month and a half ago, but I still vape.  I'm not sure if that's any better, but I still feel like I've accomplished something.  Note:  I did both for awhile and always preferred smoking real cigs over vaping.  Just curious on this community's opinion.

Citrus flavoured nicotine lozenges?

Hey guys,

I've been trying to get my mum to quit smoking for years, it's been an uphill battle, but after a few failed attempts at quitting cold Turkey she's finally expressed a willingness to try nicotine lozenges.

Unfortunately I can only find them in mint flavour and she absolutely hates mint. I don't think she's using that as an excuse, she's always hated mint flavoured candy. I've been looking for citrus flavoured lozenges but can't find then anywhere, they're all mint!

Can anyone recommend a brand that sells citrus flavoured nicotine lozenges? Or even any other non-minty flavours? Citrus would be preferable though. 

I found [these](https://roguenicotine.com/product/rogue-nicotine-2-mg-lozenge-citrus/) but unfortunately they're sold out and not sure if they'd even be safe as I can't find any reviews of that company online.

Lastly, they need to be available in Australia, overseas online retailers are fine as long as they ship internationally.

Edit: I should also mention that she has dentures, so gum isn't an option. They have to be lozenges.

What are some substitutions that you've used to get through the first few days?

One of the things that held me back from quitting before is weight gain.  I don't want to replace cigarettes with food or candy so I need some other ideas to distract myself. 

Edit: Thanks guys, I'm not sure if I'm horny or craving a smoke now!  But, seriously I will try some of these ideas and figure out the best thing for me. I'm back to work today, so a few more challenges ahead.

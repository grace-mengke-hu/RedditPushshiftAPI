Strange inner tension, wondering if anyone shares this experience...

I want cigarettes so often, but I'm also weirdly embarrassed for smokers.

Like, I pity people who have to extricate themselves from a situation just to go out for a smoke and get their fix--I feel bad for them, and I feel like, for the first time ever, I see how weak smokers actually are.

But at the same time I desperately want to join them.

I know it's only been 24 days for me. They say the first 3 are the hardest but I feel like the cravings have spiked the past couple days and it's been getting harder.

I make promises that I'll take it up again someday when I'm old, though I know this is a bad way to think.

I won't smoke, because I've come to the point where I don't feel like I need it. I just really fuckin' want it.

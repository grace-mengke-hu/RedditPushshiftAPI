Congestion after quitting?

Hi all

I haven't kept count but I'm at least 3 days in quitting cold turkey. However I had a small question.

Since I've quit, I am having horrible nasal congestion and chest pain by deep inhaling. Is this a normal sideeffect of quitting?

I did notice that smoking made my nose runny all the time, but since I stopped, I went a day with a runny nose... to at least 2 days of intense nasal congestion, coughing (coughed up a bit of mucus today). This congestion and leaky faucet of a nose is causing me a lot of discomfort and it feels like my head is in a vicegrip.

Is this part of my body clearing out all the bullshit I put into it when I smoked? And if so, how long should I expect this congestion to last? What can I do to alleviate these symptoms?

Thank you

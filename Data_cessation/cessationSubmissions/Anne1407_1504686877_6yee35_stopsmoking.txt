Almost 23 days

In 1.5 hours, I'll be a non smoker for 23 days. Two days ago I quit using patches, and I noticed things are getting harder again. The temptation to smoke is so *there*. It's hard to say no. I'm out with friends or having a break at work, and they all smoke. I know that one drag and I might as well buy a pack. I know I'm not a smoker anymore. I know I need to keep on going, one minute at a time.  
But sometimes it feels like that little voice, the one that tells me I can do it, that little voice of reason, the rational part of me that doesn't want to be an addict anymore, is getting quieter. The voice of addiction seems to be getting stronger. I want my nicotine. I need to have my nicotine. And it's difficult to say no. This is the part where I normally always fall back into smoking, but I don't want to. I just don't feel very strong today, and it's hard to keep up and not have one drag.

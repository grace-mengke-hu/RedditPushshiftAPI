First week of freedom

I feel fantastic. Training is better, sleeping is better, mental peace abound. I even went out and had a lot of pints yesterday and I felt it was great not to have to go in and out of bars to smoke!
I was anxious so I brought with me lots of gum and a chocolate bar but I didn't even need them! All thanks to this wonderful subreddit. You guys are effing awesome! :)

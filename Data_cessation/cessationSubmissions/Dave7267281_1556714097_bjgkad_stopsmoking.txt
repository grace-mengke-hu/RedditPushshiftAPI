Considering starting to smoke again..

Hey guys. So I am 12 days in and the cravings are not that strong or frequently as in the first week however I am going through a pretty stressful period in my life. I also had a pretty messed up breakup 4 months ago.  I've been living completely alone for over 2 years now, I live in an apartment where there is not much light coming in and I kind of spend most of my time inside with little to no human contact on a daily basis besides the days when I go to classes ( 1-2 days a week).. so I kind of feel that my emotional health is degrading day by day. I am a bachelor student, my deadline for submitting my thesis is in less than 1 month and I am only 50% done with it. I also have a bunch of exams coming up before the thesis's deadline while I also have to do and submit 4 other different projects by the end of this month.

By not smoking anymore somehow I made everything feel even worse, I am even more stressed than I was before, sometimes I get to the point where my heart literally hurts because I am just too agitated ( I didn't have this problem before). I used to smoke IQOS, around 1 pack every 2 days. In order to quit I gave it to a colleague since I couldn't control myself to not use it as long as it was inside my apartment. I also told him that whatever happens to not give it back in the  following months..however.. today I managed to convince him to give it back by explaining to him there are some really stressful weeks  coming (something he could relate since we are in the same class) and that I don't thing I can make it without smoking and I promised that I will give it back to him after we finish with all the exams and with the bachelor thesis validation.

To end this..he is giving my IQOS back on Monday (because he is out of the city for a few days)..and I plan to take it back..

P.S: I just felt the need to share this with you and ask for your opinion regarding this whole thing. Thank you.

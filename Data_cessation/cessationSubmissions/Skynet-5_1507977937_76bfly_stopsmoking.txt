7 weeks today.

Last year I had an x-ray for a back problem that refused to go away. They found a mark on my lung and told me to come back in 4 weeks time. That stopped me smoking PDQ. After 4 weeks they did another x-ray. No signs on disease.

About a month later I started smoking again.

I came in to work  recently and found out there was a massive restructure that I thought was wrong, even though I was not directly effected.  I realised that smoking was some sort of stress reduction...but I was immediately stressed and something clicked in my head. Smoking doesn't help. As I smoked maybe 7 a day...I still get stressed. Clearly the above is obvious. But genuinely something just clicked, almost like I was hypnotised. 

Somehow that trigger has made me stop immediately. Yes I had mild withdrawal...but nothing bad.

I smoked mildly 5-10 a day for 8 years. Before that social smoking.  

Hoping for a long life ahead of me - smoke free.

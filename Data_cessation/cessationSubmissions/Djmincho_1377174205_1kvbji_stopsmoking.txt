Day 5 and bullish

Hi there,

Wow, so this is me. I am five days into the new me without tobacco. I have smoked for 20 years and have tried countless times to give up. I feel strong and bullish about not doing it anymore. Anyone got any really good tips to make this one stick. I would love it if it did as I have two beautiful boys, and lovely wife and a lot to live for!

Thanks

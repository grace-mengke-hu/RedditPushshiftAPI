Hopefully having a moment of clarity

So I have hit another point in my life, where I want to say that I quit smoking on Sept. 25th. 2016.  I'm an introvert, so I feel a deep solace, and connection with smoking when I am in my down time.  Smoking go me through some rough times in my earlier life that was extremely trying at times. I battle with anxiety and panic attacks - which I think I have a good plan of attack against this.  I say this, not to gather sympathy, rather describe the bonds that intertwine our lives with the battle of insanity.

That bond is like watching a child's face, eat a sugary sucker for the first time.  Some 16 years of so many moments in my life, good and bad, were surrounded by the bonds that now feel so unbreakable.  But, I have been feeling different lately.  I consistently have to do the little clear in the back of my throat, feeling heavier and heavier in my lungs, constant headaches...

So I came here, and some of the stories on here are touching.  I wanted to tell a story to everyone, in hopes of finding and giving inspiration.  I think I have found my spot in the universe, and I want to take the ride as long as it goes.

My deepest sympathies to the tragedies in this sub, and good luck to those whom have found themselves in a position, such as today.

Dad smoking need advice

Hi I'm 19 I've smoked, drank, and did hard drugs from 16- almost my 19th birthday. I've been clean of everything for almost a year and I know how hard it is to quit. Reason I'm saying this is my dad had a major heart attack a year ago, has a good life and is doing well financially but still refuses to quit and get mad when asked about it. Any help cause it seems like I'm the only one that cares, and if I can do it he can to.

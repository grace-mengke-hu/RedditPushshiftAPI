One year post!

Well, I made it one year. I am proud of it, things aren't going great for me right now but at least I don't have to worry about buying cigarettes, finding the time to smoke them, and all the damage that my body is accumulating from smoking. I guess the real reason for me coming here is to encourage others, today is a good day to give it up. Good luck everybody!

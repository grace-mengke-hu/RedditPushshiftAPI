I just crushed my last 18 cigarettes in a flashy spectacle.

It had to be memorable. It had to be dramatic. Now if I start smoking again I will look like an asshole. That's exactly what I need. I posted on Facebook so that the threat of shame will haunt me every day until I can finally live like a normal human for the first time in 17 years. It's a lot to ask, but if somebody is willing to be a kind of sponsor and message me here on Reddit daily to make sure I don't touch the disgusting things again it would help a lot. If not, then no biggie. I'M FUCKING DONE, GOD DAMN IT!

I've forgotten what its like to smoke!

It was hard at first and I would have killed to smoke but I relised today that I am now 288 days in and for a while now I haven't had the urge.
That's with my girlfriend being a heavy smoker as well as my dad and a couple of friends. When I'm around them I don't even slightly crave a smoke!

So if you're thinking of quitting do it, I would have never believed it at the start but over time it does get easier.

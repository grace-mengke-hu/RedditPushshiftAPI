When does lung capacity return?

So it's been about 5 and a half days since my last smoke, and the amount of junk I've been coughing up is unreal.  It doesn't seem like my lung capacity is what it should be yet, and I'm wondering for those who have quit for longer than I have:  When does lung capacity return to what seems normal?

Is there a period of time where you cough and hack for a day and at the end of the day, you feel like you have twice the room in your lungs than you did at the beginning of the day?

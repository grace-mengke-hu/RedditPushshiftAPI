Day 6 - NRT - Advice needed on plan / method

Hey everyone, 

There's not much out there in terms of a 'method' or plan for stopping using NRT. 

I'm on Day 6 using Nicorette patches (25mg) and used to be a 12-15 a day smoker. I see a lot of stories about how NRT can be difficult to come off of but for the time being I'm just delighted to be free from the habit. Tasting / smelling things I haven't experienced in years.

My personal plan - 25mg patches for 3 weeks, then down to the lower dose for 8 weeks. Thereafter I'll use 2mg losenges in emergencies. 

Has anyone had a positive experience with NRT - specifically patches? 

Do you have any advice or methods that worked for you?

Thanks!

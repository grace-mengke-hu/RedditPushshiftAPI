Can you use placebos (0% nic vapes) to quit?

Hey all, at the ripe old age of 19 I've decided to quit smoking. I started using it as a way to cope with my dad's death and I can already feel the nicotine urges growing, so I don't want to open a whole new bag of worms with this. If my level of addiction is low (only get urges when hungry or insanely bored), can I use a placebo vapor pen to cope? Maybe the feeling of filling my lungs with something (yuck, I know) will help? I bought a juul today thinking it would be a healthier alternative, but I felt like it was a stupid decision and returned it. Has anyone tried it and saw some kind of result, good or bad?

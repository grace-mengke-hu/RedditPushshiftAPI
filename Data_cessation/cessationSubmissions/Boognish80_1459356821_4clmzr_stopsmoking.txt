Thought I'd introduce myself. I'm Boognish80 and I have been nicotine free for five days!

My boyfriend has been successfully cutting back his cigarette intake for a few months now, and I finally decided to come on board. The first two weeks I just focused on cutting back while wearing the patch. This past Saturday I stayed in, didn't go to the bar, didn't wear a patch or smoke a cigarette and I've been doing pretty well since then. 


This is my third time seriously trying to quit. The first time was bad, only got through a few weeks. Second time lasted a year but was through Wellbutrin and that stuff caused me a lot of serious problems. I'm determined that this time will be the one that takes. 


My motivations are not spending money on slow suicide, improving my health, and no longer being controlled by my addiction. Look forward to being a part of this sub, glad you guys are out here!

Having to give up on smokes for budget reasons, worried about making it.

So I've been smoking around 1 pack every two days for maybe the last two years. I've tried quitting a few times but mostly I pick it up again after a day or less. 

This summer is rough financially and I have to make priorities, and I've decided that the cigarettes have to go. Problem is, I don't know how to resist the urge, so just looking for tips and assisstance if anyone here could help out.

Can't believe it

I did a whole month and was finding it tough but not too bad and then like the times before couldn't get rid of the little voice in my head saying just go and get some cigarettes - it was stronger than the voice saying you are doing so well. Now I am so annoyed with myself. I had stopped with a friend of mine and it was really helping us both thinking we can't start again because of the other one. I feel awful with myself for doing it and dont want to tell her but feel a fraud. Just want to stop again. How can I stop that voice in my head that I can't seem to reason with that takes me unaware and says just have these cigarettes? I hate myself now for getting them and smoking them. A whole month wasted. I don't know why I'm writing this but I suppose because I feel bad and want to get that support back that I had with my friend and thought perhaps a community like this could help.

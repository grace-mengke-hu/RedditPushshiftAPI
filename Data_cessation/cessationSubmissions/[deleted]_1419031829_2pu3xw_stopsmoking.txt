Day 11

Smoking is literally all I can think about. I haven't picked up a pack yet, just because i'm at home for the holiday and it's a point of contention between me and my mom. But I've been avoiding going out alone, driving anywhere, spending time alone, etc just to avoid smoking. It's all I've been able to think about and it's keeping me up at night, honestly.

Today I cleaned my car and found two lighters and four empty cigarette packs. It was just another reminder of something I'm missing. I mean, yes, I'm happy I quit - I can breathe better, food is way more delicious, I smell better, and I just feel so healthy. I haven't even been drinking or eating unhealthy food because I know they're triggers, so I'm essentially SO HEALTHY right now. In January, my friend is moving in with me and he's a chain smoker, so I'm just so worried to be around that because I feel like smoking will be unavoidable. I'm already freaking drooling at cigarette displays in gas stations, it's embarrassing and awful.

I know this is turning a little ranty, but I just needed to get it out. I'm quitting so I will be welcome to be at home, so I will be healthy and be able to run for more than a few minutes, so I can be productive, so I can save money. Most importantly, I'm not going to smoke because if I do, my boyfriend will probably start smoking again too, and he can't do that right now and I love him and want to support him. 

I guess I just need some inspiration, and some listening ears - both of which you guys are great at. Thank you for all your help!

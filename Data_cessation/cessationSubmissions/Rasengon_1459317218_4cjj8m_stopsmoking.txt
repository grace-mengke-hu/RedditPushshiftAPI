Question about nicotine patches?

So I have been using the 24 hour 24mg patches for awhile now and have been having those vivid dreams. the dreams are never terrifying and are mostly pleasant or at the very least dull but never nightmarish. I've been told that I shouldn't wear them while I sleep because of the dreams but I was wondering if there is any reason beyond that? if I am enjoying the dreams is it still a good idea to not sleep with them on? I do feel sleepy when I wake up still I'm wondering if they are causing me to not reach REM state? 
I'm reluctant to not wake up with them on because they take around three hours to get into the bloodstream and without waking up with them on I tend to be really emotional and struggle to go about my day until the nicotine patch starts to work again usually 2-3 hours after I put it on.
Has anyone had a similar experience? or have any clear information?

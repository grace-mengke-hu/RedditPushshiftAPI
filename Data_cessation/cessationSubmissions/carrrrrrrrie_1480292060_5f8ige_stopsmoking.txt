Officially a non-smoker... day 6

I'm on day 6 and my friend suggested this page. I don't really have much to say other than I'm grumpy, anxious, and tired. I can't believe I've made it this long. I'm super grateful, but don't feel great... but I also don't plan on stopping now. CHOO CHOO!!! On to day 7! :D

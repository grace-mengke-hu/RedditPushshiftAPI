Any scientific research on the benefits of smoking? Research papers with abstract, methodology, stats?

All I could find was the benefits (I'm sure you have all seen that) after 20 minutes, 10 days, 1 month, 1 year, etc. etc, but honestly, I don't really find that scientifically backed up -- it seems to me it's more like a "motivation" to stop smoking.

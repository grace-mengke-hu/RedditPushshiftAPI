Should I be feeling this shitty?

Hi, I've been smoking for about two years. I recently moved to Europe and it was so cheap that I quickly got to one pack a day and have been so for about the last 6 months. 

I came home for spring break, my parents hate it and I thought, why not quit, so I have nicorette gum and the cravings haven't been nearly as bad as the last few times I cut back. 

It just seem to be having loads of mucus-y chest problems and my hearing is all funny too. I guess I'm kind of pissed that my body seems to be punishing me in a new way instead of the regular 'I'm going to kill all of you' feelings. Any tips?

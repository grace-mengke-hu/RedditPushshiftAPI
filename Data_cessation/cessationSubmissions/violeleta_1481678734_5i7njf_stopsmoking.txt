starting my quit journey . 14.12

hello. I am starting my quit smoking journey today. My father has cancer so it is high time to quit and stick to the quitting. I am ver motivated, as when I smoke, I do nto even like the taste of smoking and notice that I do not have pleasure when I do it at all. 
Now I brace myself for the first three days.

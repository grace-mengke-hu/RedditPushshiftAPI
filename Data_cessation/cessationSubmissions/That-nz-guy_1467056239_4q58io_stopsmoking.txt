Questions about not quitting

Hi guys,  first time posting here.  I am a 23 year old male and i have smoked on and off since i was 17, i am a university student so around exams i tend to smoke anywhere between 7-15 per day.  During the week i dont really smoke at all, occasional one at lunch but not often.  And on the weekend if i am drinking, it can vary from a few to an entire pack in one night.  

I have quit on and off, gone up to 9 months with none, 2 months with none, then exams hit and i go back to them.  In the last 2 weeks i have had maybe 3 smokes.  I for some reason do not find it that hard to stop, it is the alcohol that makes me cave, get three beers in me and i cant keep it up.  

What i am here to ask is a few things actually,  i am fairly fit, i gym and am fairly active.  But in the last 2 weeks, i have been experiencing tightness in my lungs and a weird feeling, quick google results come back saying this is fairly common, i have this and shortness of breathe, as if i am hyper ventilating.  It comes and goes, is this fairly common also?  I am pretty keen on stopping altogether this time, every time exams come around and i do go back on them, it is much less than the time before.   I do not want to smoke anymore, so if anyone has any advice at all that can help, i have not tried things like gum or anything like that. 

And the symptoms im feeling are they normal?  I am not in pain, but my lungs feel different and occasionally i feel like i am breathing through a wet towel (Not that bad really but it is noticeable.  

Thanks for any input.

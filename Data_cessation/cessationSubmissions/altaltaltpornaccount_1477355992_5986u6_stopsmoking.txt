~~Fifth~~ Sixth? time quitting

I've tried quitting many times. This is the time that will stick. I just threw my pack out last month and I haven't had the desire to smoke at all, even when drinking.

I only think about smoking when I see a post from this sub in my feed.

If you're having problems, hang in there, and eventually your frame of mind will just click and that will be that.

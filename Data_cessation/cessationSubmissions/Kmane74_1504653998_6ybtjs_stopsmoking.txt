It gets easier....

I thought I never would quit smoking cigarettes but I had a realization one day that I just can't keep smoking and think that I'm not going to get a smoking related disease. 44 days in, it's gotten much easier I don't wake up thinking about a cigarette, I crave way less than the first couple weeks. I'm sure all of you heard this before, but if I can do it anybody can. It's never too late to quit, you just have to believe in yourself. To be honest the stop smoking commercials and ads had a huge impact on me quitting.

Good luck to all of you throughout your smoke-free life! It gets easier and it's never too late!

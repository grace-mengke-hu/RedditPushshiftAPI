Day 1: Quitting smoking for good

I'm not a heavy smoker by any means. Over the past four years I have varied anywhere from a pack a day to a smoke a month. Recently, due to stress, I have been having a smoke here and there. I know it doesn't seem like a lot to those who probably smoke more, but I want to end it here.

I want to put this here as a guide, as a self motivation to drive myself to drop the dirty habit. I hope reading other peoples stories will drive me further.

Day 1, Begins.

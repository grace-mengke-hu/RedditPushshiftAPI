I'm ready to quit..I just need a plan. I think breaking the habit will be harder to deal with than the withdrawal.

I have a daily routine that involves smoking. I wake up, coffee and cigarette. Drive to work..cigarette...breaks and lunch at work..cigarette. Drive home..cigarette. I won't know what to do with myself. Especially when I drive. My other hand will be empty and that's not natural for me. Tips?

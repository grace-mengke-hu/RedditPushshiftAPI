I'm getting from no smoking

Good day. I've been trying to quit smoking for some time now. But after about 18 hours of no smoking I go into dumb mode.  
My focus and short term memory are non existent, articulation as well, but that is tolerable. And because I need both of them every single day - I can't afford to lose them even for a day.  

What can I do to avoid getting dumber while quitting smoking?  
Thanks in advance

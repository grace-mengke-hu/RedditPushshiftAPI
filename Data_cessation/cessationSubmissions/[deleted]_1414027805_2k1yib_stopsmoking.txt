Honestly I don't need advice on quitting

Catchy title huh? Hehe..

Seriousy though, I 've read a lot of information on how to quit smoking, what to expect the first few days etc. so technically I'm an expert on quitting even though I haven't done it myself.   I'm planning to finish my last 10 or so ciggs tonight and start smoke free tomorrow.  I may run out to Barnes and Nobles pick up Carr's book either tonight before they close or tomorrow.  I did watch a video on Youtube based on his book, and found it very motivational.  

So, tomorrow morning when I wake up I'm going to get my car washed (it does need a good washing), throw away the 10 or so empty packs and empty the ashtray-I might throw away the ashtray as well.  

I've been smoking since I was 16 or so, now I'm 28. I know it i will be hard, especially the first couple weeks.  I did manage to quit for 2 days a few months ago, I gave in on the third day and lit one up and felt SO good-but I'll not give in this time.  I will try to resist any urges.  I don't know why I'm writting all this, I guess I need motivation and maybe some helpful tips.  

I will think of something to do/purchase for myself as a way to reward myself for not smoking for an x period of time.  I'm thinking I'll get a massage (yes that type of massage, otherwise where's the reward) if I can go a week without a cigarette.

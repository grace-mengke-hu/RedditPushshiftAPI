Dedicated for those who still struggle

This sub can be demotivating as hell at times.

All these self-congratulatory threads, [*I haven't smoked 3078 cigarettes in 7 months! :)*](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/24mu7y/i_havent_smoked_3078_cigarettes_in_7_months/), [*1 month smoke free! Couldn't be happier.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/24n566/1_month_smoke_free_couldnt_be_happier/), [*Quietly passed the two week mark, 300 cigarettes not smoked.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/24mp0q/quietly_passed_the_two_week_mark_300_cigarettes/), before I quit they made me feel like shit. Even more when people succeeded on sheer willpower or even without it: *“I just woke up and realized I don't want to smoke anymore”*. And I had to read a fucking *book*, fucking goddamn Allen Carr, having to endure chuckles and patronizing. *“A self-help book?”*, *“You need a BOOK to quit?”*. You wanna tell me I have no willpower, I am an irresponsible low-life incapable of getting shit together? Fuck you! And fuck those who post their boastful threads about their success as if it is supposed to motivate me. Oh, and fuck those who babble about dopamine as if neuroscience isn't at its infancy and is comparable to string theory in explanatory capability.

Do you struggle with quitting smoking and feel the same way I did? Shit, sometimes this sub makes you feel inferior, but let me tell you this, ignore these people around, it's not your fault that you can't quit. If you fail for a long time, no matter what or how hard you try, it means that you're doing something wrong. But *doing* a wrong thing is not the same as *being* a wrong person! It's not your *fault* you can't quit!

The *single* reason people can't quit, even if they diligently try, is because of **fear**. And fear is like a virus of the mind, it paralyzes the rationality and begets all sorts of self-defeating thinking patterns. You start believing thoughts that aren't even yours, because one distorted thought entails another like a chain reaction, and they all mutually reinforce each other.

Smokers start feeling irresponsible, stupid, inferior. *“Why can't I quit smoking? I have no willpower. I'm an utter loser.”* Not only immature teenagers, but responsible and respectable people who have their lives under complete control, fall prey to fear. But you can't save face while admitting you're insecure as hell. So your mind automatically starts inventing bogus justifications: *“It's just a habit”*, *“I'll fool around and quit”*, *“I like the taste”*, *“It helps me cope with stress”*, and so on.

Humans are amazing at fooling themselves with bullshit. Cigarettes smell and taste horrible, their stench stick to skin, clothing, towels, bed linen, car seats, everything. Non-smokers can scent you out from a distance, and you can't hide it no matter how hard you try. If you've smoked just some minutes ago, wherever you go, you leave a trail behind. Cigarettes are so dastardly, they pose themselves are friends and aid, when really they are manipulative swindlers, they convince you can't live without them, that you need them. Smokers are miserable, and you know what? So was I.

I felt I was a shit person for not being able to quit like a man. I clang to cigarettes, I came up with all sorts of bullshit rationalizations. What I didn't realize is that to quit smoking you don't need willpower—which I never had—you only need to *know how*. But nobody knows how, not smokers, not non-smokers, not even medics and neuroscientists. But everyone feels obliged to tell you some well-known fact. Everybody feels the need to either admonish you, or patronize you, or deride you, or insult you. Just look at these ugly pictures on the cigarette packs. They haven't stopped *anyone*, not single soul, from smoking! And idiotic TV campaign ads, which people who never smoked create to feel better of themselves, to assert themselves at our expense.

It was a life of misery and self-hatred for a few years for me, until I quit something like half a year ago. Nobody helped me, not other ex-smokers, not moral support of anyone, not group therapy. There's a reason these books are called “self-help”. Even though 99% of them are crap, Allen Carr was the shit. Carr's book wasn't a magic button. It wasn't a tip, trick, or technique. It wasn't a bunch of worn-out wisdoms, nor was it a terribly complex system with exercises and stuff nobody would carry out anyway. It was nothing more—and nothing less—an explanation of what nicotine does to your mind and what is the nature of addiction. In other words, it was simply *knowledge*.

The only thing a smoker needs is an internalized knowledge, understanding, that the only thing that stops you from quitting is *fear*. This fear is different in people, but it's always completely irrational and unjustified, because people are very good at detaching from reality. Some people think the food and friendly gatherings won't ever be pleasurable again. Some people think they will endure physical pain for weeks. Some people think their temper and personality will irrevocably change. And finally almost everyone believes they will never be completely free and will always long for a casual cigarette. *“Once an addict, always an addict”*, they say.

This is a popular meme that is always assumed true without careful reflection, especially by groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous. That an addiction is a disease, therefore it can't be cured instantly, it requires constant struggle, *“one day at a time”*. But it just isn't true that you have to endure, fight, persevere, and suffer. It isn't true that you need willpower, or specific personality traits, or appropriate conditions or time, or moral support, or suitable environment. This are justifications for not quitting just like any other. All you need is **knowledge**.

One such knowledge is that your fears of quitting are always *temporary* and *conditional*. They aren't set in stone. They aren't bigger than you. They control you as much as you allow them to. You aren't bound to failure. But sometimes quitting feels so hard that it *terrifies* you. People are so paralyzed by fear they can't even *think* about quitting. This is called [“emotional reasoning”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_reasoning)—you erroneously judge your abilities and personal traits based on your current feelings, and feelings are ephemeral. Morevore, feelings are always secondary to thoughts, they are the product of certain thought processes. For example, you're angry when you perceive unfairness, you're frustrated when you expect yourself, others or the world be different from what you get, you're depressed when you think poorly of yourself. This is a rough description, actually, there are many different thoughts happening in your mind that lead to a certain emotion or behavior, but it's true. And fear is the result of a perceived threat or danger. You *think* that something is dangerous somehow, for whatever reasons, therefore you *feel* afraid.

But feelings are extremely persuasive. The panic from thinking about a cessation is sometimes so big that people automatically conclude, that quitting is going to be an insurmountable toil. And still, emotions are not a source of truth. To explain emotional reasoning, think sexual arousal. Imagine that you want sex so bad, you can't think about anything else. You even start to imagine your whole future revolving around some kinky adventures. Yet just after you finish, you become apathetic and disinterested, as if you could live without sex for the rest of your life. This is emotional reasoning at work.

Why would anyone, even a heavy smoker, be terrified to *imagine* themselves quitting? Nobody's gonna shoot you for thinking about quitting. And if you smoked for many years, nobody is actually able to *coerce* you into quitting. So you have *absolutely nothing to lose*. Not only you can boldly imagine yourself quitting from different perspective without feeling threatened, but you can even quit for a period of time *for the sake of experiment* and at any point in time return back. The cigarettes aren't going anywhere. You lose nothing.

So let's wrap up. Our moods and behaviors are determined by cognitions, in other words, thought processes. Cognitions include, among others, your assumptions, beliefs, attitudes, rules, interpretations and perceptions. Therefore if you start thinking about yourself or the world in a certain way, you'll get the corresponding emotions, feelings, anxieties, habits and actions. The moment you fall prey to irrational thinking patterns like judging based on emotions, predicting future without evidence, overgeneralizing your failures, labeling yourself with vague and emotionally-loaded descriptions, thinking in terms of “must” and “should”, quitting becomes pain. But it doesn't have to. Cigarettes aren't valuable, they aren't your friends, they give you nothing, but take everything that you love and care about. And quitting is not climbing Mount Everest, it's not a sacrifice. You don't give up on anything, but rather escape a terrible prison.

Stop falling victims to feelings of inferiority, induced by these dumbass pricks how don't know shit about smoking. There is *nothing* in your genes, brain, past, or personality, that prevents you from quitting smoothly and painlessly.

You need to carefully analyze every single reason you give consciously or unconsciously for smoking and against quitting. Reflect deeply and put *everything* on paper. Don't skive off, this is important! Do you really believe cigarettes are an aid, a crutch, a friend? Do you sincerely convinced quitting has to be a sacrifice of something valuable? Now look at your list of “reasons”. Is every item *actually* true? Do you have *evidence* that this particular reason is *justified*?

If you don't know where to start, think about this. Have you ever finished others' fag-ends? Have you ever stolen others' cigarettes? Have you smoked in secret? Did you buy horrible brands of cigarettes, when your favorite was out of sale? Did you ever lie about how much you smoke? Did you ever break promises related to smoking? Did you ever pretend that you have no cigarettes to save them for yourself? If you want to smoke, what distance are you prepared to travel to the shop?

Think about how you feel and perceive yourself. Do you feel you are weak-willed, stupid, sluggish? Do you have bad health? Do you feel anxious, inconfident, ashamed, guilty? Or apathetic? Or irritated? Do you regret wasting money? Do you feel self-conscious about the smell that non-smokers so subtly scent out?

Why don't you feel excited about quitting smoking? *You dread getting weight?* But you won't have that problem, because ex-smokers who get fat are those who replaced one craving with another. *You think smoking helps concentrate, relax, cope with stress?* But nicotine just exactly the opposite, it makes you endure the withdrawal symptoms, which then you reduce back by smoking again. *You like holding something in your hands or mouth?* Then why it has to be a lighted-up cigarette? *You fear you'll never smoke again?* So what, I wouldn't panic if someone told me I can't eat napoleon cake anymore. *You have suicidal tendencies?* Then why don't you jump off the roof? *You cynically state that we already poison ourselves with car gases?* But you don't willingly limp on an exhaustion pipe of a car. *You think we'll all die anyway?* But you don't like the idea jumping under the bus. *You have so many problems you can't think about quitting right now?* But smoking doesn't solve any problems, it only adds more. *You think smoking isn't that bad?* But you wouldn't encourage your kids to smoke. *You don't care for the nicotine, you just like the smoke?* Then why don't you buy nicotine-less cigarettes? *You say smoking is the only pleasure in your life?* How about literally everything else—family, passion, hobbies, ideas? *You think smoking is your only friend?* But loneliness and boredom is what smoking creates in the first place.

You see, nicotine is a drug that screws with your mind. When you quit, you'll think *“how could I even think this way?”* It's not you, not the rational, real you. The real you is the one who is capable of abstract thinking, rational reasoning, memory, creativity, love. But your addiction can't think, reason, remember, create or love. It only wants instant gratification, no matter how unpleasant and horrible it is. But you aren't responsible for ending up in this trap. Addiction is ignorance, not a flaw in personality.

I hope this makes it easier for you to quit smoking on your own, ignoring all these stupid self-centered people around. I hope you will feel free again, happier than ever before. If you still not sure what to do, read my [explanation of Allen Carr's ideas](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/246g80/allen_carr_explained_in_11_paragraphs/) and then read Allen Carr himself.

Feel free to criticize, debate, discuss and so on.

*If you are one of those, who posted “I haven't smoked for X days”, you might've been offended by the introduction of this post. Please, don't. It's not meant to insult or deride you, but to empathize with people, who struggled with quitting like me. Smoking is a terrible curse that fucks with your mind, so smokers deserve to be understood even if they behave like jerks.*

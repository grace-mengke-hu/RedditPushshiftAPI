I virtually cheated!

I'm on day 5 after 22 years of smoking. And I just woke up after dreaming that I did smoke an entire cigarette (in a social setting). It feels like I cheated and I should reset my Cessation timer for displaying weakness. But wait, maybe this is just a sign, a good sign actually, of mentally processing this whole thing?

Day 87.

I don't feel like a smoker. I don't fiend cigarettes like before or think about them daily, even when my friends or family puff in front of me. Never thought I'd see the day. 

I go for runs again and though I'm not a pro I've drastically increased my stamina. I do crave randomly in stressful situations or times when a dart would calm me down but I fact my problems head on, never close or nothing to the point of actually considering smoking. 

Cravings now almost just a feeling of uneasiness/angst that you may not even notice as a craving. Advice? What to expect after 3 months cold turkey after 5 years pack a day... Gratitude. Things to look out for as I continue my journey? Some drunk nights I've considered a puff but my pride keeps me strong.

To all else, it gets easier. Continue. Soon enough you won't notice you've smoked cigarettes. Think about that. 87 days and I don't even notice them. Maybe once a week if that. Keep on quittin'

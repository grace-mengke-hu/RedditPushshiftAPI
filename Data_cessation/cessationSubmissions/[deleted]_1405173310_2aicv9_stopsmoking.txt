How did i quit?

Hey guys. 

i have read some many post about how to quit here and i just wanted to tell my story 

i have started Smoking when i was 12 years Old and smoked one pack a day when i was 15 Years old. a few days before my 20 birthday i just made the decision that i do not want to die early on smoking and that was it. i just quit. 

i still had like 5 packs left and i just trowed them in the trash. since this day i have never ever touched a cigarette again. 

if you ask me what helps best? 
the pure will to life a healthy live.

and by the way... after all this years i still have some moments when i think i would really like to smoke right now. but this will never happen.

sorry for bad English :)

i wish everyone good luck who is trying to stop smoking

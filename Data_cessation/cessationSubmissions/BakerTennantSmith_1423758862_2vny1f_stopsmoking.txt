Nervous wreck. Not going to smoke . . . .

I am about to start getting ready for a very big interview. I graduated with my Bachelor's of Social Work degree this past Spring and this is my first "professional" interview. I want this job so badly. My nerves are going crazy and I keep getting the "Oh, just one smoke. Come on! It's not a big deal"

Except it is. The cravings remind me just how big of a problem smoking is. I'm not going to smoke but damn, there is a mini-war going on in my mind right now. 

And another thing to put on my "Reasons I don't smoke" list:

If I get this job, I'll be working with children. I don't want to smell like smoke.

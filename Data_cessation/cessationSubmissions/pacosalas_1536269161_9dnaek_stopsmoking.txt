1 month

So I got to one month... I did it with the cessation pill support (champix), and stopped with the pill 4 days ago. 

Is interesting how easy it was to forget that I was ever a smoker, but then a situation would come when I'd normally smoke in the past and I can sense my body not knowing what to do. Is really the habits, and not the craving or desire to smoke, just a lot of automatic things... Am trying to observe myself.. like today two friends came over and they were smoking next to me and I felt that fuck I'm different than them which is a wildly irrational thought but apparently is something that was part of my smoking and I didn't realize it. 

Especially for the ones of us who started as children and our entire identity was constructed with the notion of being smokers... I'm learning how to accept and love myself as a non-smoking human being with the age of 31, horrible what this drug does to us. But good to be able to exist without:)

Sorry for the long rant, and thanks for maintaining this Reddit, it helped me a lot!

13 days & avoiding triggers

Hi All - I quit on 12-18 because I got sick - bronchitis & laryngitis. I'd been trying to quit but was only able to get a couple of days before something would trigger my addiction. My greatest triggers are work (stress), my 19-year-old (stress) and seeing friends who smoke (fun). No matter how many days I had or what I would tell myself the craving would rear its ugly head and I would smoke again. I have been avoiding those friends but eventually I'd like to see them again. And I can't avoid work or my kid (I've been off for the holidays since I quit). What has worked for you to deal with triggers?
TIA

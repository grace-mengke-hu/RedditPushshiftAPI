10 year smoker, after a bad anxiety attack I'm really trying to change my whole lifestyle.

I'm 25, close to 26 and I've been smoking for 10 years. Its amazing how fast time goes and you realize you've had this horrible habit for so long. I've been having bad health issues along with some broken bones and knee issues leaving me in pain really until I go to sleep. About 2 weeks ago I had a severe anxiety attack leading me to try and quit. Unfortunately my crutch for my anxiety issues has been cigarettes for so long now that I don't know how to deal with my stress anymore. I'm stuck in a shitty job with few friends and I feel like I have nothing to look forward to in life. Cigarettes really helped whenever i needed a break in my life. I'm using the patch which is helping with the physical withdrawal so far, but emotionally it doesn't do anything. I can't really exercise other than short walks for the foreseeable future, so it also feels like quitting isn't enough. My body feels horrible but I know this is going to help. I'm on day two and I'm glad I found this sub. Im committed to quitting no matter how hard its going to be, and I look forward to sharing my success story like so many of you guys seem to be having.

TL/DR: I'm glad I found this sub, and I'm hoping whatever support I get  will help me slowly get my life back together.

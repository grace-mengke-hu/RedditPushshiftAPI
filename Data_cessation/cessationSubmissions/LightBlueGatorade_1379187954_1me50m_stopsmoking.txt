Day one, again.

Ugh. There never is a good day to quit. It's going to be hell regardless. 

I was going to just post the usual "fuck this, fuck that, fuck you, fuck everything" but as I was typing it, I realized these urges to smoke are going to happen, so just suck it up, be a man, and deal with it. There's no point to negative posts. I don't know what the point of this post is anymore, but thanks for reading. 

EDIT: Fuck all of this.

60 days, and this last month has been cake.

I have to say, after the first month, I've had no serious cravings. Sure, I've smelled it and my mouth watered like a dog staring at a bone. The thing is, I don't smoke, so it's not an option for me to partake. The mood swings are gone, and being active has never felt so good. I've had 17 years to have my fun with cigarettes, but we aren't friends anymore. We aren't allowed to hangout. I'm learning to apply this to my drinking. It's no easy task, but I'm getting there :) Here's to a great day, everyone!

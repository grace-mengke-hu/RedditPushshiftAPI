Smoke free app mission 9...

This mission is to repeat the “not one more puff, no matter what” ten times, ten times through out the day.  Unfortunately I read the mission to late to start first thing in the morning.  I have been thinking this Mantra since day 2. I just repeated the mantra about 20 times (to kinda make up for missing the mission all day, I guess?).  I am surprised that the first 8-10 times saying it just now I was a little on edge- started thinking “am I seriously never going to have another puff, really? Really? Can I do this?”  Then it started to switching to a more “I’m resolved to never ever have another puff” and solidifying my want to quit smoking.  Thank you to all the people on this subreddit and the smoke free app- it definitely helps getting through the days.  Besides slugging water when a craving comes on I open this subreddit and just read- sometimes I I’m not even paying attention to what I am reading but whatever.  I AM a non-smoker.

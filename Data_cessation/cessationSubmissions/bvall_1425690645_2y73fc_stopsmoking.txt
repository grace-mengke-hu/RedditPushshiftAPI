What is the longest you have quit, then gone back to smoking?

Just hit 60 days! Never tried to quit before, and decided to go cold turkey. Feeling pretty good and not too worried about slipping back into the addiction. I don't plan to ever smoke a cigarette again. None of those, "Oh I can have just one since I am not addicted anymore" cigs.

So I feel like I may be getting too comfortable. Whats the longest anyone in here has quit then went back to smoking? Especially interested in those that did not use any nicotine substitutes.

Please share and join me in not smoking today!

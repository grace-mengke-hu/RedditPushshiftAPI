I'm so afraid of dying early because of smoking

I've quit smoking 142 days ago now, and I smoked between my 18th and 25th birthday. Part of the reason I smoked was just being depressed and not having enough to live for. During the past years, this has changed dramatically and I'm optimistic about the future and want to make the most of my life.

However, I'm so worried about the health effects I've caused by my stupid habit.. I want to live until I'm at least 80, have kids and a beautiful wife but I feel like I'm a ticking time bomb that will get cancer before I turn 50. This severely fucks with my sense of self-worth, how can I justify to get someone to fall in love with me while I ruined my body for so many years? It just feels like such an unfair thing to do. 

How do I cope with these thoughts?

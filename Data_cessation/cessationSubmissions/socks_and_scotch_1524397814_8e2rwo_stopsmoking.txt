After 14 years I quit

After 14 years of being a pack-a-day person I finally bit the bullet and quit. I do use a vapor to get the rough edges of, but I notice that I seemed to be just really done with it. Havn't had one urge to hold, or smell, or inhale a cigaret. Even when I am out of nicotine not one fiber in my body wants a cigaret. The withdrawls are quite big though but facinating as hell. Tomorrow marks my first week and even though the roughest parts are still to come, I am so fucking happy!

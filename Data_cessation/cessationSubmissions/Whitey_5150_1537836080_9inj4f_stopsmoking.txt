Quitting today.

Hey guys, so today I am officially going to try and stop smoking. This actually isn’t my first time, since I’d quit for about 8 months when I was with my ex (largely due to me switching to vaping). However, I’ve had a lot of heavy personal events happen to me, and unfortunately I reverted back to it. 

I can’t vape, as my boss at my job is very watchful of it, and sees it as a bad visual towards clients. So I’m just at the point where I can barely go a day without having a cigarette, and to be honest that scares me. I have no idea what alternatives are available to get my mind off of things. Like, I tried going to the gym and being healthy in other avenues. However, when I get out of the gym, all I can think of is ‘finally, I can have a cigarette now.’ Has anyone else been through this? Any tips are really appreciated, and I really want to cut this demon while I still can.

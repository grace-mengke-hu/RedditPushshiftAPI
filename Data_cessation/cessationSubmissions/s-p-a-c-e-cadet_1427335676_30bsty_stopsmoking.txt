Any advice before my quit date?

Sunday is my quit date, and any tips for preparation would be literally life saving.


Edit:Badge has been requested and phone application is ready to go! Thank you guys for the advice and support. I'll be back frequently for support and to give what help I can to this amazingly helpful and encouraging subreddit.

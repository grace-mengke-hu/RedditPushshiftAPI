Okay, so last week i messed up...

Last weekend i messed up by smoking three cigs whilst out drinking with some smoker buddies (all of my buddies are smoker buddies), i reset my badge and i've been doing great this week. I'm going to limit my drinking tonight so i'm not too tempted, but was wondering if there are any tips anybody here uses to manage their cravings when alcohol gets involved.

Drunk you is the most addicted you.

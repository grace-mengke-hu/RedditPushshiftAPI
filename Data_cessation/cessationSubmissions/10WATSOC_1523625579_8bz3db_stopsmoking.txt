The Dreaded Smoke Break

Howdy all, 
    hope this post finds you all well. I'm just looking for a bit of advice on the problem I'm sure a lot of us have had to deal with - the Dreaded Smoke Break. I work 3 x 12 hour night shifts which allow for 90 minutes break and smoke breaks whenever. The other 4 days a week (and beyond if I'm off for some reason) are no problem for me to quit smoking, but the minute I get back in that factory I'm smoking like a chimney again. What advice do yall have for keeping myself occupied? Ideally I'd like to replace it with something, but I don't have a clue what...

Thanks in Advance!

8 days smoke free, but feel like now I'm just addicted to the gum - request for advice

The good news is I'm only chewing like 2-3 pieces a day, but at this point i feel like if I don't have the gum to combat the craving I would smoke.

I'm just interested in hearing any success stories or thoughts on the best way to use NRT. Did anyone just replace one nicotine addiction with another?

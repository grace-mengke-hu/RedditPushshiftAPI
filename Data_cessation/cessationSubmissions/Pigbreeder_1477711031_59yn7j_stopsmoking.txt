Requesting a badge reset

Hey all recently my partner and I went to Vietnam on a holiday, while we were there amongst all the sight seeing and partying I slipped up. 

I am back on the wagon (5th day cold turkey), also I stopped smoking pot about 5 weeks ago,  last time I quit I was still smoking weed and over compensated because of not having tobacco.  I have decided that in order for me to make these initial stages of quitting easier I shouldn't drink either as it was the reason I slipped up on holiday (thinking a couple of months) .

This time definitely feels easier than last time,  but day 5 has brought on some pretty yucky feelings.

Upcoming music gig..

G'day, So i'm on day 6 of no cigarettes, so far so good. But in a few days i'll be seeing an all time favourite band of mine and no doubt alcohol will be involved and cravings will be at a somewhat intense level. The friends that will be accompanying me are all smokers, and the social aspect of smoking/drinking is the only hurdle i can see myself stumbling on.  Any of you good people have any tips?  Should i allow myself one or two?

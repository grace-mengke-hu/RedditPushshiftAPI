Seven days and ecstatically proud of it today

I stopped cold turkey a week ago. I was smoking about 2 and a half or more a day. One week later and I've never felt better about my decision. The first days were excruciating but I started feeling better on Thursday. I was invited to a BBQ birthday party today and was a bit reluctant because I know there would be a lot of smoking. I went and didn't smoke. I hadn't even told anyone I had stopped and I let them smoke in front of me. I didn't pick one up. I am so proud of myself because I thought I would never be able to do it. I can go out now. I can be free. Just set your mind to it. Don't let anything get to you and you'll be fine. Please quit if you haven't. It feels amazing. I remember finding this sub years ago and thought I would never come back here. Today I am proud to subscribe to it.

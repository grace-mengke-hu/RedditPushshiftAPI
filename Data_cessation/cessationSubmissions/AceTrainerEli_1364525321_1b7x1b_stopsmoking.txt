Second time quitting, determined to make it my last.

I just found this community, and I'm thrilled to find so many supportive quitters! 

I've told everyone I know that I'm quitting today, and I've removed anything that reminds me of lighting up from the house. This is my second time quitting, and I'm reaching out for a bit of advice/support to make it my last. My last job was a bust-ass warehouse distribution job, and I relapsed by smoking a few cigarillos on break to take the edge off. When I was laid off, I became mildly depressed and dove back into cigarettes to take my mind off being unemployed. Now I've found myself unmotivated and still dependent on nicotine, and I'm trying to turn things around, put myself out there and hopefully land a steady job; but I've decided quitting smoking is going to be my first step. So, fellow quitters, got any quit tips or craving mitigation advice that worked out really well for you?

Officially 4 days smoke-free!

I genuinely keep forgetting about cigarettes. Which is surprising. I am on nicotine patches and the occasional gum however it makes me feel weird. To be honest I feel as though I could probably survive without anything but after 8 years of smoking I am a bit dubious about attempting that so soon. 

Mostly I feel out of it. Like something is missing. I had less enthusiasm for some things this weekend, and all in all I feel like I've transported to another realm. 

I had some wines with my Mother last night and had the WORST cravings yet, literally sprinted up the road to buy a packet, luckily my boyfriend stopped me so I am still on track! Yay for supporters (and restrainers). 

Does the weirdness pass? I want to feel normal and excited about things again rather than 'meh'.

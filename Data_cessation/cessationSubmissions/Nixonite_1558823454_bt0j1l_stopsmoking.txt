Anyone here addicted to nicotine gum?

Longtime nicotine gum user here, love it, absolutely love it, but I must admit that it's a strange habit in public. Are lozenges more discreet? 

I have never tried lozenges, but are they as effective as gum? 

The 21mg patch just isn't enough for me, anyone tried using two patches, or mixing it up like 21mg + 7mg? 

Tried vaping, too messy. It always leaks.

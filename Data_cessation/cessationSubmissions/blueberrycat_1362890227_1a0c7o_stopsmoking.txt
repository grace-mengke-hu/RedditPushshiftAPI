Day 23 and the Patch Side Effects are Getting Worse

I am in day 23 of quit attempt #god only knows. I started using the 21 mg patch at the beginning of February and smoking 1 cigarette a day until the 15th when the pack was finally empty. 
    The first 3 weeks of February were almost a breeze. There were a few mental desires for a cigarette, but not the usual anguish, mood swings, irritability, and urge to destroy everything around me. 
   However, the past couple weeks, the patch has started leaving bright itchy rectangles of fire and doom anywhere that it has been adhered for more than 3 hours. Naturally, I move it from place to place, but all it does is leave me clawing at my arms, my hips, and the tops of my legs at any given moment. I apply hydrocortisone cream, aloe, lidocaine and the relief is only temporary. 
    So far, this has been mentally and physically easier than the other times I've stopped smoking. I've tried everything but Chantix, which at $180 a month and no health insurance, is not an option.  The gum is like cardboard. The electronic cigarette is too much like smoking and is like a tortuous tease, leaving me longing for the real thing. I work with children, so cold turkey is not an option right now. They look down on verbally traumatizing children in my profession, probably even more so than smoking. 
   I must deal with the side effects of this miserable patch, because it is healthier to have bright red itchy skin than to inhale a cigarette and push my asthma closer towards emphysema and cancer. However, if anyone has any ideas for reducing the unpleasant itching let me know. I have also tried moving the patch every 8 hours and not wearing it at night. It doesn't matter. 

On the other hand, I've been enjoying the ability to vividly and clearly remember all my weird dreams...

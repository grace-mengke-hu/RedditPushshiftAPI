Read Allen Carr's EasyWay, still failed...

Okay.. So Thursday evening I finished Allen Carr's EasyWay before going to bed. I was the whole Friday without a cigarette and that was the first time I really felt like I could make it. 
Anyhow it did not feel as easy as the book told me it would be, still had some cravings for it. 
Just a few minutes ago this Saturday morning I gave in. Not been this tired and annoyed in ages... Maybe I didn't take all the books instructions in on me. Guess I'll have to read it over again. 

Anyone else have experience with this book? Did it go as easy on you as the book says it will?
Feel like there is no way anything will work if this book won't.

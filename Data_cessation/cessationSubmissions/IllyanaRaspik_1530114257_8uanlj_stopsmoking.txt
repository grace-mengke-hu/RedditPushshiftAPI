Thoughts on nicotine replacement therapy?

I've been quit a while now, but I noticed a trend in the community of some people going cold turkey while others used nicotine replacement.

Nicotine replacement was REALLY effective for me, I stepped down off it after about 3 months, so I'm wondering why some of you folks don't utilize it. Just personally curious, not meaning at all to impugn anyone's method of quitting! Do your thing your way!

10 days; thoughts, experiences, and venting.

I have made it 10 days without nicotine. I have attempted to quit nicotine many times and I had been using almost only a vape for a long time, around 2 years probably. My job stresses me out, I'm a medic on the night shift and weekends with a partner who drives me up the wall. So I have a horrible sleep schedule, I barely see my loved ones and significant other, spend all day with someone I cannot stand to work with, I see and try to help people who are sick and dying (some from COPD and lung cancer after smoking for their whole lives yet still can't quit), drunk folks curse me out and try to fight me and assault me from time to time and meanwhile I'm trying not to tear my own hair out on a regular day, let alone with nicotine withdrawal. But hey, I have made it through 10 days. I feel drained and depressed, but the cravings are no longer strangling me all day, now they are like slaps in the face. All of a sudden, I am hit with an overwhelming urge to smoke or vape and then it passes pretty quickly. Hopefully the cravings will soon turn into pinches then nudges that are easily ignored. Also, the vape was definitely messing with my skin. If anyone is having rashes or acne that you can't seem to get under control, it could be your vape. I had cystic acne on my scalp that I could not get rid of, on the second day of no vaping, all of the painful bumps on my scalp were gone, and the skin on my face was smoother and less splotchy. I have made it 10 days and I am determined to stay away from nicotine.

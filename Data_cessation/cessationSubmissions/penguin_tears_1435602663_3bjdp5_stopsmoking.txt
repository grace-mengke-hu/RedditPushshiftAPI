I can't believe how bad cigarette smoke smells.

I am so embarrassed that I ever walked into buildings smelling like cigarette smoke. Ever since I quit, I find it absolutely intolerable. If you quit recently and the smell is tempting to you, trust me -- that goes away and you'll realize how nasty that smell is!

Extreme hunger

So it's been roughly two weeks since my last smoke. For the last 3 or 4 days I've been feeling like there's a black hole in my stomach. No matter what I eat nothing seems to fill me up. 

Now I have started an entire lifestyle change so I've cut out fast food and soft drinks entirely. I'm pretty sure I'm getting the correct amount of calories but this hunger is kind of concerning me.

Could it be related to quitting smoking?

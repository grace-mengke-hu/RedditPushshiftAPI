Last cigarette, hopefully.

Smoking my last cigarette right now. My cravings are strongest in the morning and I always make sure to have at least one for when I wake up. Fuck that, I'm done smoking and need to man up. I'm gonna go to bed after this, wake up, and sit outside right next to my ashtray and drink coffee without a smoke on my hand. 

Honestly I'm worried I'll bum a cigarette after a day or two, I've tried cold turkey before and I always end up failing. If I can keep myself from buying a pack and smoking with my friends I got this. Send me some strength guys, it's really freaking easy to pick up a cigarette without thinking.

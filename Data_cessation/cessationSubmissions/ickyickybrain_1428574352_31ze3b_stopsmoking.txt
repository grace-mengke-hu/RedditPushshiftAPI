Ex asthmatic smoker here...

Hey everyone! So after a lot of thought and overuse of my inhalers, I decided to quit smoking and switched to e-cigs instead. I wanted to go jogging, but as I was still smoking I felt a lot worse for myself. It's not fun when you can't breathe.

Not smoked for two days and I can already tell a slight difference. But with my asthma, does anyone know when my breathing will return to normal again?

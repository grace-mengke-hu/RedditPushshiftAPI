267 days since I quit? Noice.

To those starting out, keep at it!  I smoked from age 16 to 43...a long goddam time.  I never really tried to quit until the last 5 years.  So I cut down, then went back up to half a pack a day, then down, yo-yo'ed a bunch.  Then I tried Champix.  Worked like a charm.  Kept smoking for 2 weeks after starting it but the drug really kills any joy I was getting from smoking.  Then it gets gross.  

Then you stop.  Then you stop taking Champix.  For a while, you think about smoking A LOT!  It's willpower after that point.  Then you stop thinking about it so much.   Then you dream about it and wake up feeling relieved you didn't fall off the wagon.  And then, somehow, 8 months have passed and despite wanting to smoke every now and then, you're a non-smoker.  It's sooooo liberating.

What don't I miss?  Smelling bad.  Bad breath.  Self-conscious feeling.  Being a social pariah.  Getting cold & wet standing outside.  Running out of smokes and going to the store at 11 pm on  a Wednesday night just to make sure I have them first thing in the morning.  The expense.

Anyways, to the long-timers and newbies alike, thanks for the support here.  THIS made a lot of difference to my quit journey.

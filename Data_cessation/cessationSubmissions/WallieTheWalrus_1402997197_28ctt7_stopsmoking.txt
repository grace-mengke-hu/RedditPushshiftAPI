Trying again, and I'm f#cking hating it...

Hey guys, 3 weeks ago I managed to stay smoke-free for 10 days, but then I broke my key to my appartment, causing stress and the perfect excuse to start again. So, I smoked my last cig on Sunday night, and now I'm on my second day and I hate everything and everyone...

So here I am again, the struggle is real. Whish me luck, I'll need it -_-

Started again after 20 months being smoke free

Basically the same as my last relapse, I got relocated for work, felt disoriented and stressed by the new environment, and the first thing I reached for was a pack of Marlboros (conveniently placed next to the cash in our canteen).

It’s only been a week but it didn’t take long to get back up to a pack a day again... I have some gum left from the last time I quit so I guess I’ll finally get to put it to good use! :\

I’m new to this sub but I’m glad to see it’s here, I’ll be looking to the rest of you for inspiration and motivation as I go through this again...

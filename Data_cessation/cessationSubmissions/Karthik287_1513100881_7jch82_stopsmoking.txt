The Icky Threes

Hey guys. 85 days smoke &amp; nicotine free and man does it feel great. 6 days away from 3months! :)

I've had some mixed feelings over the past day or two. I feel urges I haven't felt in months. I can't help but wonder if its a case of the icky threes and if anyone else who has gone through it can give me some pointers. These are definitely the strongest psychological urges I have felt since the first 2 weeks. They seem to appear in the same pattern as well. Right after a cup of coffee, meal, next task, etc. Will I have to put up with these sorts of feelings for the rest of my life?

Here Goes Nothing...

Obligatory I'm on mobile, so format and all.


I really want to stop. And I need to stop. Smoking is harming me financially and is slowing down my progress in life.


I started smoking my senior year of college. Stress and all, partaking in trees every few weeks. But then it became a habit. I started lying and wasting money, stopped exercising and lost 30lbs of muscle. 


I'm in therapy, so I'm definitely going to talk to my therapist about quitting. But after lurking through this sub since I started, I know that this would definitely be a great start. Just putting all this out there because I felt like I needed to and I don't know what else to do until I meet with my therapist.


I want to say thanks in advance to anyone willing to give advice, and a big thank you to everyone running this sub and helping everyone who comes here searching for guidance.


P.S. I'm on my second to last smoke as we speak.

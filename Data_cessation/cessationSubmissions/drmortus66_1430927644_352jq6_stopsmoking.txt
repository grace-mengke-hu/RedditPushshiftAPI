1 week today

So I had to quit smoking due to getting my wisdom teeth removed, first few days were not so bad as I was doped up on Percocet and other fun stuff they gave me.

Ran out of percocet and I have become a complete dick, how do you guys do it?
Voices are grating, the slightest provocation will set me off.
I have almost asked my co workers for a bum all day today on my first day back.

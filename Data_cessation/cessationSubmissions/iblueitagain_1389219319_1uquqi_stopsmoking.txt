48 hrs in, still here

so, i'm in a minute i'm off to bed, another day smoke free. it's pretty hard not to fly of the handle and i've been quite a wanker to a few good people. its strange, i can see myself being a right twat, but i just can't seem to stop it. had 1 nicorette today, down from 5 yesterday. hoping for none tomorrow. good night my fellow quiters!

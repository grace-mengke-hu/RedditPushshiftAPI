I am pregnant and in pain and I wanted to quit!

I am currently going through a very bad moment. My husband passed away and I am pregnant. I used smoking to mask the grief and the pain and the stress I faced daily from losing him. I dunno how I am going to move on. I know I shld not be smoking esp when I am now 5 months pregnant. I worried about the baby but right now its so hard and so painful. I really wanted to quit smoking and not let it bond me. Pls help me anyone

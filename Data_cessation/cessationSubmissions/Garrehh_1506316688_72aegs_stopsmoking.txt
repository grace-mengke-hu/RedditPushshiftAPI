I need help quitting

I've been a smoker for roughly 10 years now, and I have quit before for 8 months. The first time I quit went effortlessly, because at the time I really started to feel bad about having smoking as a habit. I was smoking a pack a day back then before I quit. 

But when my boyfriend at the time broke up with me, I picked it up again and started smoking more.
Now I have this wonderful boyfriend, and he smokes too. We tried to quit together, but that led to us smoking while we had patches on, and it got so out of control that we smoke 2 packs a day now. I feel absolutely horrified when I think about it. I crave a cigarette almost every 15 minutes. I'm starting to feel the implications of it, and I can't put it off any longer. I really am done with this, but my boyfriend is not.

The first time I quit, I was able to throw out all my tobacco and tobacco related stuff (I roll my own cigarettes). Now, I can't toss anything because SO still needs it. I'm afraid that being confronted with him smoking so much and the tobacco lying around will make my quitting almost impossible. Does anyone have tips for me? I plan on quitting in 2 weeks, when I have a week off from school so I can take my time without stressful situations making it even harder. Any help would be very welcome.

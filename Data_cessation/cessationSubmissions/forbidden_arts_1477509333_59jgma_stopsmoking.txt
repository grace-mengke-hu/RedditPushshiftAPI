Damn you alcohol! - Any tips for dealing with cravings while slightly inebriated?

I've been smoke free for slightly over a week, but I broke today.

Does anyone have tips on how to deal with the cravings while out and about after they have had a couple of beers? I've been holding strong while sober, but I've also been a bit of a hermit because when social lubricant is applied, I was worried about my resolve, which didn't hold out.

How do you guys deal with not smoking while drinking? Admittedly I was unprepared, but I'm not going to be next time. Little help?

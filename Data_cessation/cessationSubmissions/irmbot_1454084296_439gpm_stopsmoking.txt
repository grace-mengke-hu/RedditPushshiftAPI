Been smoking for 10+ years, now want to stop

Hey /r/stopsmoking!

I want to quit smoking. I smoke about 5 cigs a day, and a pack lasts me 4-5 days. I am already abstaining from alcohol, and am not sure if it is wise to quit both things at once. I believe they kinda go hand in hand. My roommates currently smoke, and I don't think it will be easy to quit if I'm living with smokers. I plan to move in March, so maybe I should wait until then, even though I really just wanna quit today. Any thoughts?

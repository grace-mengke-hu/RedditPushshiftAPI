4 days in and I don't want to go back... Help me Plz :'(

This is my second attempt quitting and it hasn't gotten much easier if at all since the first try :'( I need to quit since I train in Muay Thai everyday and hope to compete by next year, also nicotine is just horrible for my mental health and makes me feel horrible everyday. The hardest part is not letting your brain trick you :'( when I start telling myself that "it's okay to just have one" and I look for reasons to justify having one is when it gets rough, and when people say the cravings "Never go away, it's always a battle for the rest of your life" is when it gets REALLY ROUGH because then it makes me feel like this is not even worth it :'( so do you guys feel it's a bad idea to even have one? Does it lengthen the duration of these withdrawal symptoms?? (As I type this I know I'm subconciously hoping that you guys say it's okay to have one so I can run to my coworker and grab one, but I really hope you guys say it's a horrible idea so I can smack myself into shape) And do you guys feel it's true that the battle never ends, or is it much easier to deal with in the future? I have only been smoking for maybe 4 years??? And a pack every 3-4 days. I smoked a Juul for the last year. Thank you guys so much for any help through this!! :'(

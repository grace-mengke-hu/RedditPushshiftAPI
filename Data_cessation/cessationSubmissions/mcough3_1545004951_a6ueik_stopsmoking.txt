Just got through day 6. Intense cravings and super low feeling seem to be dissipating.

Can’t believe I’ve been putting poison into my body for so long. I think behavioral therapy has really helped. I’m excited to walk into my therapist Wednesday and tell her how I’ve ditched cigs and blunts for good.

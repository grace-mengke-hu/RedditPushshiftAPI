2 days and 16 hours smoke-free. I'm feeling good although the cravings are a little bad.

I'm doing good so far, though the cravings come and go. In truth, I've been smoking tiny amounts of weed to hold off the cravings when they're at their worst. It's really working for me. The other facet of my plan is to isolate myself. No unaccompanied trips to the store where I could find smokes, no going to work where I could find smokers. I'm being overly cautious now, but I will succeed where I have failed so many times in the past.

Day 15

Today is day 15 of being a non smoker. The first week was not as bad as I thought it would be - mind you I smoked at least a pack a day for 20+ years. I just kept telling myself it was an addiction and I did not want to be an addict anymore.
This week has been more difficult. At home I do fine - don't think about smoking at all. At work it is a very different story. I think about it a lot and the cravings are pretty bad at times. My job can be very stressful - I have to keep reminding myself that a cigarette would not make the stress any better.
It is one moment at a time. I just hope that it will get a little easier son.

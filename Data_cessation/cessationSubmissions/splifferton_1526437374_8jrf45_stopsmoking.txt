I need a few Huzzahs

I'm now at 3 weeks and 5 days.  3 weeks and 6 days ago I was told that I would be put under general anesthesia.  Fearing that my stupid choices would prevent me from raising my children made me quit (I'm a single father).

I'm still here to raise my kids, and I'm going to keep trying to be cig free so that I can see my grand kids...

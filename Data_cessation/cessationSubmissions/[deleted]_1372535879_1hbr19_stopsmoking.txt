Is it possible that the"Easyway" is a little too simplistic?

I've just read Allen Carr's book, and I am essentially in the middle of my first smoke-free day. It has been about 14 hours since my final cigarette. 

I admit, I feel better than my previous attempts to quit, but I still feel agitated and irritable and restless. I assume that's normal, but Carr's book would have me believe that I am supposed to be enjoying myself, so I'm feeling like I've done something wrong. I finished the book last night, and I had so much anxiety about quitting that I had nightmares and woke up many times in the middle of the night thinking about it.

My issue with smoking, I believe, is that I've always felt that I can't quit, or that I will just be stuck doing this forever. I don't believe that I like it, I don't believe it does anything for me, I have just always felt like a hopeless addict.

Can you please tell me that it's normal to struggle, at least the first few days? That my not feeling like this is easy or enjoyable doesn't mean that I am doomed to fail?

I have just discovered this sub, so I am still going through and reading other posts, but I appreciate any and all input and advice, thank you!!

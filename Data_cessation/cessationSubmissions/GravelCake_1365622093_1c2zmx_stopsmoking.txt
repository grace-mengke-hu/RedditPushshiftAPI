2 Weeks cold turkey! Cravings = Curbstomped!

So, 2 weeks done. And I haven't had one smoke. Not one.
In the last week I have been outside drinking with people who were smoking, so I had several triggers going on. I still did not give in. I feel a splitsecond of cravings, before I crush them.

I am so proud of myself, I didn't think I could do it. Before I quit I thought it would be like climbing mount everest. But I fucking did it.

Thank you for all the inspiring stories /r/stopsmoking. You have helped me more than any 1-800-stopsmoking hotline or nicotine gum ever did.

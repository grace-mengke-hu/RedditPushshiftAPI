Day 60!

Today marks 60 days smoke free for me! It was difficult at first, that first week was down right brutal, but it has certainly gotten easier. It's still a challenge when I'm hanging out with my friends who smoke and we're tossing a few back but it's much easier than I ever would have expected as long as you remained committed to yourself. I smoked for 9 years and this is the first time that I've tried to quit and while I still have a long road ahead, I'm pretty proud of the fact that I've managed to make it this far without a single slip up on my first attempt. Of course it helps that I've always told myself that I would quit before I had kids and my wife is due in about a month. I made a promise to her that I would quit before our baby comes and that I'd do my best to stick with it. She has been my rock and my biggest supporter when I needed it the most. 

So over the moon today and I'm going to use this feeling as motivation for the next 60!

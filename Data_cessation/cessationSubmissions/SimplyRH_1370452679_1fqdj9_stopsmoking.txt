Day 4 without, and it feels AMAZING.

Seriously.

There are small cravings that set in. Moments of boredom where I know I could easily burn a few minutes with one... pun intended I guess. But nothing not completely manageable by the idea that my body did not need nicotine before I started smoking to get by and that smoking gains me nothing.  Whereas not smoking is an actual victory that gains me everything.

Seriously, that one concept, which I read in Allen Carr's book, is enough.

Hell, I even went to the bar last night and got a good buzz going and didn't want one. Everyone was lighting up around me and the smell... oh God, the smell... I still didn't cave.

I'm about to go for a run now. I seriously cannot explain the elation behind the idea that I am no longer a smoker. That should encourage anybody to quit.  Thanks to this subreddit for helping me realize how stupid smoking really is.

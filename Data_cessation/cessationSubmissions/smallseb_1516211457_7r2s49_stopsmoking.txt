Day 100 ish

I didn't thought I would go this far. This is close but 100 is a great number! 
In the morning I don't spit black and bloody thing from my mouth like I was in the first 30 days or so; my doctor told me that was normal and it would get better. I was concerned and now think that's what my body rejected... I should have took pictures for those of you whom are thinking about quitting. Don't wait, your body will reward you day after day.
Some of my colleagues at work told me that my face was radiant! 

When I exercice or do sports, I don't have to catch my breath any more. Or it's because I am doing way more than I was when I was a smoker; 

Things got different tastes. Wine is way more different and it's a new world. I have to learn again with new tastes that I never had "right". 
I don't have bad days any more. I don't feel trapped. I don't think about how many cigs I have left in my pack. I gained more than 400 â‚¬ in 100 days. 

I don't get craving any more. Actually I don't think about it. 

You can do this!

I'm so incredibly scared to quit.

Around this time last year, with the help of the friendly folks over at /r/keto, I managed to drop 40lbs.  At around the 30lb mark, I felt so in control of my life that I was able to quit smoking fairly easily and stayed smoke-free for about six months.  I felt amazing.


Fast forward to the summer, I started again.  Between moving back to the city, food, booze, smoking friends and free time, I began this awful habit again and gained back almost all of the weight I lost.  I feel like a failure.  


I've been getting chest pains and recently took a trip to the ER because of it; I was forwarded to a cardiologist that I have not yet seen yet.  I'm not healthy and I know that smoking is a huge part of that, but I'm scared to death of trying again.  I don't feel in control this time and I'm scared of failing again, because the feeling that cigarettes are stronger than me is worse than anything.  I feel weak (mentally and physically) and less confident this time around - if I didn't manage to stay smoke-free when I felt in control, how can I possibly do it now?  I don't know what to do or even where to start.

It all starts today.

My girlfriend, whom I honestly consider the love of my life, needs me to quit. She hit me with the line, 

"you don't want to be a father who smokes "

Because we always talk about having kids together, this really hit home. I've got 50 pieces of nicotine gum and I'm going all in. Wish me luck brothers.

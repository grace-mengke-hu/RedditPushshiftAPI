Newfound Freedom/Early Revelations

Having smoked daily for the past 7 years I am astonished by the amount of free time I now have just by not smoking. I would make smoking a priority and consequently would devote a substantial amount of time to this habit:
(7ciggys/day)(5min/ciggy) = 35 min/day, not to mention time recovering from smoking the 4,000 chemicals (impossible to comprehend) I just inspired, the time it takes to get to a hidden smoking spot, the time planning my next cigarette, etc.

Also, not having my entire day revolve around when my next cigarette will be is so refreshing and motivating to me. It's only been four days and my outlook is already changing. I devoted so much mental/physical energy to smoking, truly a prisoner to this addiction. I can now use this energy to better my life, why would I ever go back?

Nearly slipped last night, decided to reflect on journey. Increased my willpower.

I just want to reflect on my experience of quitting. It’s been a long 27 days. I hasn’t been hard, it’s been long. I feel as though the idea of smoking is wearing off slowly and I am becoming accustomed to the other side. I sometimes forget that I was a smoker. Sometimes don’t remember the generic taste and smell. My mouth is reborn to taste and flavors I’ve missed in my two-years of smoking. They surly outweigh that generic feeling in your mouth after a smoke. Waking up never felt so good, the ability to breath in, breath out and sense the oxygen flowing around your brain is indescribable – a sink-plug opening up after a dirty bath. Sure I miss it at times, especially with friends, friends whom I’ve only known to converse to with a stick in my mouth. But at those times, where the line between an offering and lighting up is so thin, I ask myself this. Is it worth it? Is it worth waking up with a guilty conscious because of something which has absolutely no benefit? In that split second it’s a battle between willpower and temptation. Am I going to accept the short-term pleasure over long-term?

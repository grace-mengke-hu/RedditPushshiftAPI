Made it 3 months last time. Trying to make this one stick!

"Just one, to take the edge off", I drunkenly convinced myself. "You've been stressed out lately. Just have one and you'll be fine."

I bought a pack a couple of days later. "Just one" turned into "just one a day", which later became "2 or 3 a day, more if you've been stressed or drinking".

I'm so tired of failing at staying away from cigarettes. I though I had broken the addiction after staying clean for 3 months, but found out the hard way how easy it is to fall off the wagon.

My last dose of nicotine came from drunkenly smoking the rest of a pack on New Year's Eve. I woke up the next morning and decided I was tired of not being in control, so I spent the rest of the weekend and the Monday after in bed white knuckling the nicotine withdrawl. The cravings aren't as intense now, but it's still a daily struggle to keep myself from bumming one when I smell smoke. 

This time will be different. I'm not going back to being controlled by a substance.

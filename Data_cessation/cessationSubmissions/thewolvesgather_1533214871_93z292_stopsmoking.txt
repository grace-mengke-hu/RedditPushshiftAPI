Today I celebrate 3 years

I wasn't a heavy smoker. I smoked for 5 years from age 18 to 23, about 15 cigarettes per day (rolled by hand).

For a while I had the feeling that quitting will only be harder in the future, and I watched as my 40 years old boss at the time struggled to quit after 25 years. This was my main reason to quit at the time (this and worries about my health).

Smoked my last cigarette exactly 3 years ago. It was hard but I did it. I'm still hanging out with smokers regularly, drinking, and doing almost all the regular stuff (minus the joints, which I miss), and even found some new hobbies (like working out).

Occasionally I get the urge to go back to it, and I still have dreams of relapse once in a while. But even as a child I've always wanted to smoke so it isn't a new feeling, just a forbidden pleasure that I have to live with, like so many other people have to live with theirs.

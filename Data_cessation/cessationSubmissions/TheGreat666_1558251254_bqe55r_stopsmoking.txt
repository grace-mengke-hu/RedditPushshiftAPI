The battle never ends

But it does get easier. I quit 3 years ago. Seems like an eternity since i use to be a smoker. I have some friends that still smoke, and i’d be a goddamn liar if i said i didn’t crave a puff every now and then. 

I know myself by now, and all it will take is one drag to suck me back in, so i avoid it every time. 

Quitting means persistence ladies and gentlemen. Quitting means discipline. Quitting means commitment. Never take that drag. 

Someone on another addiction sub said it best: “you never regret NOT smoking.” 

Happy sober living. Ya’ll are doing great and im proud of you.

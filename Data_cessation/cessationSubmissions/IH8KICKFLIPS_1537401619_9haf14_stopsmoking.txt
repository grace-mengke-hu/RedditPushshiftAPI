What’s the worst thing you’ve done to get your smoke fix?

My intention in asking this is to reveal the awful horrible hold that nicotine has on us. Sometimes just writing it out can really open up our eyes to the ridiculousness of it all. I’ll start

I was drinking with friends. Ran out of smokes. Remembered that I had thrown out a pack the previous day that had a partially smoked cig. So I go through my trash only to come up empty handed. Maybe it was the *other* trash can... nope. Hey maybe it’s in the dumpster! So I go out to the ally and pull the dumpster down and go through my apartment buildings trash. Nope not there. I sulk back to my apartment. On the way I see a cig that had maybe 1/4 of it left someone tossed on he ground. Of course I burned the germs off the filter and got my fix.

So instead of enjoying time with my friends, nicotine instead convinced me to go through 2 trash cans, 1 dumpster, and smoke someone else’s throw away. Wow.

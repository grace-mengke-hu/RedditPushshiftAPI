Quitting for the last time today!

20 YO male smoking ~1/2 a pack since I was 14 and started ~1 pack+ a day since I was 17.

Ive tried quitting a couple of times and the only time I made it more than 3 days was from July 2014-November 2014 when i had a serious work injury and my surgeons refused to operate on me unless i quit smoking. I always hit 3 days and the nicotine withdrawl kills me but not anymore.

Im gonna have my last smoke out of my last pack on my drive home tonight and after that i refuse to buy anymore. I have an ecig that i bought last year that helped me a lot to stay off smoking after my accident but too much shit hit the fan at once and i went back to it. 

Heres to my final attempt.

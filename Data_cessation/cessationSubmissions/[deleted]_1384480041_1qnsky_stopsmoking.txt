3 months to this day. I should probably advise against reading this post if you're going through first week withdrawal.

EDIT: I don't know how to delete posts but I didn't want to keep this here in case it inspired anyone to smoke again: it was just an overly descriptive account of smoking. Apologies, and good luck all!

Right now i became one of you

After 13 years i just finished my last cigarette in this life. I herby pledge to myself to never smoke again. Not even one cigarette, nor in this lifetime nor in another. I am deeply proud that i can finally be a non smoking person and discover myself anew. I am one of you. We are proud non smokers.

I want to help as many people as i know to quit this disgusting habbit. Feel free to PM me, i will talk to you as much as you like.

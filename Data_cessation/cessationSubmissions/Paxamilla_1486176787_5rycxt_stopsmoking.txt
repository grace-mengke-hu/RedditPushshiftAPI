12 days... What a difference!

Currently on day 12. Starting to realize how serious my addiction had become now being on the other side. I've been a pack a day smoker for 10 years and decided to kick the habit shortly after new years. I'm approaching 30 and didn't want to start my 30s still hooked on the crap. Here's hoping I keep it up and hopefully avoid related illnesses in my future. 

Couple things I've really noticed after quitting. I'm finding it harder to fall asleep at night because I feel wired all the time, and when I do sleep it feels much deeper. My dreams are more vivid especially and I often smoke in them, feeling regret upon waking up. 

During the day I'm finding my energy levels to be very high and my levels of concentration have gone through the roof. I'm absolutely killing it at work and people are noticing. It feels almost to good to be true considering alot of other people's quit stories contradict my own experiences. I was expecting to feel horrible and exhausted! 

Fingers crossed that things only get better!

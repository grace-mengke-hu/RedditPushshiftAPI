Tips for a short term smoker before it gets serious?

So I had my first cigarette about 5 months ago, now it's a habit. The hardest part is that I am 16, and obviously not being able to buy them, having to steal them from my grandpa. I feel disgusting, and have started to enjoy less and less over the past week or 2. The taste is getting worse for me. I know you will all be giggling saying 'haha 5 months how cute,' but I really do take it seriously and I don't want to fuck my life up this young. Lots of adults have told me 'if I could go back to your age I'd stop while I could,' but that doesn't even give me the slightest clue of how bad it is. I've heard the horror stories, they just don't phase me. Obviously I can't just go buy patches or whatever, so I'd appreciate if anyone could give me a tip on how to stop without any equipment? I can go about 3 days before my brain just thinks about it non-stop, there's no way I can do this alone.

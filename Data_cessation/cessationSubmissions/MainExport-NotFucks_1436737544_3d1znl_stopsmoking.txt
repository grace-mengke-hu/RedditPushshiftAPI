First day

Mid 20's, been smoking for 9 years. I've tried before, and most recently got down to just 1 or 2 cigarettes, with 1 day of none. That was about a month ago.

Now I have the nicotine gum and I really want to quit smoking. Mostly financial reasons. Plus both my grandpas had cancer from smoking and I don't want to live my final days with 1 lung in Hospice. 

I will try to be regular on here and defiantly update my badge if I do slip (which I hope I don't again) and try to be a non smoker. Thank you guys for being here and good luck to all of you as well.

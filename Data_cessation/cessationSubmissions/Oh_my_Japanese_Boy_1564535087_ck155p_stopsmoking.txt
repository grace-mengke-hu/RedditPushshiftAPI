College student here, been smoking since 15, I'm 21 now

I'd rather spent that money elsewhere. I don't like how much my throat tightens when I'm nervous because I crave a smoke. Or how in the morning my first instinct is to get a smoke, when I finish eating, when I go to the toilet, when I read, when I fap, when I get out of my dorm for dramatic effect(and serious nerves), when I'm gaming at home. I'm tired of it.

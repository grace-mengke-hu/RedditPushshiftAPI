Day 13 and struggling with my emotions

I am really proud of how well I've done but I am really suffering on the emotional front. 

I have suffered from anxiety in the past which has reared its head again but in addition I am feeling what I can only describe as despair on and off - 3 days ago it lasted about 6 hours and I literally sobbed. 

I know I won't smoke again but am finding the emotional stuff really difficult and hope it improves soon.

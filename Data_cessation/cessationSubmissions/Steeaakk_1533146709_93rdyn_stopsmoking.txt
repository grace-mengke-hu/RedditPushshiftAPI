day 2 sleeping trouble

So I finally managed to go a full two days without smoking, the biggest issue for me has been not being able to sleep. I used to smoke a cig right before bed - got zero sleep last night and I think the same thing is going to happen today too.  Did anyone else have trouble sleeping after quitting? What did you do to stop it?

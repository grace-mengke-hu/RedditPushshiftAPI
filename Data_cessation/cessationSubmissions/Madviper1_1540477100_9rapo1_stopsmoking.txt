Back on the wagon. Any advice?

So, I tried to quit smoking two weeks ago and I made it exactly 7 days. I used the patch. What I found odd was that in the beginning I had a lot of cravings but not a lot of withdrawal but by day 7 I had a lot of withdrawal with few cravings. It all was going good until about day 5 when I suddenly felt depressed. Day 6 I spent the whole day in bed and then day 7 I had the worst withdrawal - like I was constantly on edge and right on the verge of smoking a cigarette. I ended up smoking one in the evening and went on a 1 week relapse.  


Anyway, now I'm back on day 1. I'm trying to use the patch this time + the lozenge for breakthrough cravings/withdrawal. I'm also reading Allen Carr's book though admittedly not following all his advice. I mean there are some good points in there but I do think NRT is the way to go and I'm quitting without finishing his book.  


Good luck to you all and thanks in advance.

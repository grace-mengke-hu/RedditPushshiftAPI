30 days in emotional breakdown

Hey guys! 
I've posted here a few times before and every time it has helped me! As of tonight I'm 30 days clean! Wahoo, I guess. I had a super intense emotional breakdown today. I'm on a family vacation, all of whom are non smokers and are very supportive of me. I've gone to a few clubs where smoking is very prominent and had no desire to smoke; I was actually repulsed. But today I had a complete breakdown. Crying, screaming the works. I admit I had a few drinks over the course of the day but no where near drunk. I don't know where these emotions came from. Could it be from quitting? or is it something else? this whole trip i've had intense desires to smoke but no real cravings. I think that I'm really missing the smoking lifestyle and the breaks from family. God, I don't know now. I'm terrified that these intense emotional reactions will push me back into smoking. Thanks for reading! 

TLDR: After a month quit: are my erratic emotions due to nicotine or should I seek help with a mental health specialist?

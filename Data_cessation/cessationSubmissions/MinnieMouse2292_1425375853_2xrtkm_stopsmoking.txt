What if addiction was a question of perception?

So, I've read Allen Carr something like 5 times. Each and every time I read it, I understood what he said, it never clicked but I followed his instructions as best as I could even if I failed 4 times. There were 2 though that were hard to agree with:

1) don't ever envy other smokers

2) don't regret your decision.

I had started smoking september of 2012 and I stopped again on the 22nd of February this year.

The more I think about my smoking, the more I realize the big monster actually is much harder to deal with than the tiny nicotine monster. I can deal with the post-lunch, post-work cravings but there are some cigarettes I miss very hard for reasons that elude me.



Why do I envy smokers so much when smoking made me feel miserable? Why do I regret my decision whenever I am surrounded by smoker friends? More importantly, HOW do I change my perception of these circumstances?

These demons are doin jumpin jacks now!!

Quit using prayer, cutting down for a few weeks, and Allan Carrs (bless his soul) easiest way to quit. Cravings have been pretty bearable and withdrawl almost non exsistent accept for trouble sleeping but whatever.. Not the worst thing thats ever happened.

About 8 hrs away from day 5!! Its been easier then I thought. Yesterday morning-- day 3, was tough. I started going to the gym a couple days before jumping to help defeat this thing, which I HIGHLY recommend.  But yesterday, the nicotine demon had me convinced I was going to go to the store to buy and have "just one" ðŸ‘Œbefore the gym!!ðŸ‘Ž It was insanity!! All the other cravings have been minimal but that one was like I was on autopilot. Said "Not today Satan!" Went straight to the gym and kicked my own butt into submission... showed this stupid flesh who's boss ðŸ’ª and have been good since. The plan is to continue to beat this thing down..oh and food! Lotsa food for the first 10 days or so before scaling that back too. Thanks for reading. We got this!!

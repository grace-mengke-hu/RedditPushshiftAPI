Trying to quit smoking pot? I've made a discord to have live chats with others to help each other through the rehab process

I know the first thing you are going to say is take this to /r/leaves. The mods have asked me to not post there as they do not want any association with the discord server.

"...we just don't have enough people to moderate it properly, so we've decided against it. I very much encourage you to start your own chat channel and manage it the way you see fit, all we ask is that you not use the leaves name or associate it with the group so there's no confusion."

So i thought this would be the best next best place to post this. If you are trying to quit smoking and would like live chat to talk to others about the process or are looking for help or just someone to talk to, then stop by. /r/leaves is an amazing sub but sometimes you need faster interaction then waiting for someone to reply to your thread.

**THIS DISCORD HAS NO ASSOCIATION WITH /R/LEAVES**

7 days free!

So I finally freed myself from this filthy thing! I smoked for more than 10 years and been (seriously) trying to stop for the last year. After many failed attempts I came across the "The Easy Way to Stop Smoking" by Allen Carr. And that was it. I read the book, put down my last fag and I was done.

If you're trying to quit then do yourself a massive favour and read that book! I wish somebody told me about it 5 years ago. But better now than never.

And oh yeah, I couldn't be happier that I haven't smoked in 7 days and am looking forward to never smoking again :)

edit: way to show support fellow non smokers, by down-voting. Just wow :/

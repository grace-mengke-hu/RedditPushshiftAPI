Am I the only one using a bong?

Trying to quit for the 100th time it feels like. I've been smoking tobacco for about 3 years (pot for5) daily. I started mixing a little tobacco in a bowl every once in awhile. It was what all the kids my age were doing at the time. I've never had a problem with cigarettes specifically, I haven't smoked one in months. But the fucked up feeling/headrush you get from a bong rip of tobacco is just different and I can't live without it anymore. Just wondering if I'm totally alone out here.

Sorry if I inspired anyone to try it, please don't it's an awful feeling.

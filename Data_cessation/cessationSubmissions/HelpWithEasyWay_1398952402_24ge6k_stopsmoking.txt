Help with stopping using Carr's "Easy Way"

Hello all, I've been a longtime lurker in this sub, and I am proud of all of your victories. I hope to join your ranks soon.

I have been reading/listening to "The Easy Way" for some time now. I believe I first read it all the way through in 2008 or so, and I have returned to it many times since. It's been the only thing on my car radio for over a year. I nearly have it memorized.

I feel like I agree with everything in the text, and I know that my attitudes towards nicotine addiction have changed. My mind has all the right answers, but I can't make the leap. Even attempting to conjure up a quit date fills me with dread.

I know many of you have used "Easy Way" and I was hoping to get some help and insight from you. What do I need to do to take the leap? I am desperate to quit... I just can't quite convince my mind to do it.

PS - further evidence of the shame of smoking, I couldn't even use my regular account to post, had to make a throwaway

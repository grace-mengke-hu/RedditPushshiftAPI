Just over 3 months and didn't notice!

I was on here every day for the first few weeks of my quit for support and motivation.  I haven't been on for a couple weeks and see that I missed my three month anniversary.

So for all of you just beginning your quit - it gets easier and easier.  My thing has been smoking just isn't an option anymore.  So I don't miss it anymore.  I don't think of my smoking days with longing.  I look back and think why did I smoke 23 years?  Being a non-smoker is awesome!

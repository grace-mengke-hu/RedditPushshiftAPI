My kid had emergency surgery and I didn't smoke.

If I can do it, anyone can. I get addicted to any substance on earth. I quit smokes cold turkey, after a morning cigarette, threw the rest away. I had nicotine gum that day, and have been nic free ever since. I just know if I have nicotine, it will start the addiction all over again. Plus I feel and smell healthy. And the kid's okay.

Day 3 and feeling great!

Hello! I just wanted to say hi and thank you all for being here and sharing experiences and support. I've been coming here for a while, as I've been trying to quit, but I've never joined before...I'm not sure why. 
I've smoked for 17 years, sometimes as much as 30 cigarettes a day and sometimes as little as 10 a week, and for the past 6 years, I've been "addicted" to quitting. I've tried the patch, the gum and pretty much every NRT available.
A few days ago, I watched Allen Carr's movie and then listened to his audiobook, and I think it's the best thing I've come across so far! I won't say it's "easy", but so far I feel great, and I'm excited about a future as a non-smoker! 
I also know that 3 days doesn't mean I'm in the clear, so I wondered if anyone else has used Allen Carr's method and can share experience- I'm so excited and nervous at the same time, and I feel like I know I won't fall in the nicotine trap again!

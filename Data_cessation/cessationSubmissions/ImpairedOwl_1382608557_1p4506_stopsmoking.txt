Almost a year now, and yet

I am five days away, and while quitting was a big challenge, it got better with time. Up to a few months ago, I could sometimes forget I even smoked before (even if it was something I did for almost half my life). But lately the cravings have come back like if I had just quit hours ago. Not only that, but even my convictions seem to be weakening. I am dreaming of cigarettes again, but now when I wake up I don't feel as guilty as I did before. 

Has this happened to anyone else? Does anyone have any advice?

Some bad times

I am getting really shaky now, I crave for cig from 1 to 10, about 8. I have this problem, over summer, I used to smoke only on weekends, so I trained my body to think on friday it will get a cigarette, so everytime I quit, i usually go 5 days without them and then I fail. I want to be prepared for he fifth day, any ideas how? I always find a reason, extra money, time, I get angry And i need one...
Now I want to kill my hands, cause I see them shaking and searching for lighter!

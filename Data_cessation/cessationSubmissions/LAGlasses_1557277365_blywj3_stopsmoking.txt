One more thing I can do!

Today I got back from a 5 day road trip. It was 12 hrs one way and I DID NOT SMOKE! It felt so incredible not to be a burden to the people in the car with me. I didn't stink, I didn't need to stop every hour or 2 just to get my nicotine fix. I'm 18 days in, this morning I woke up and my hair smelled like shampoo, my pillows smelled like detergent. I am so proud of myself right now and so proud of those of you fighting with me. Stay strong. We can do this!

The first 24 hours went by easy, day 2 is more difficult

Wednesday evening, around 8PM, I smoked my last cigarette. It was quite early in the evening, but after reading a shocking post on this subreddit I thought why the hell would I smoke 3 extra this evening if I can just quit now.

The first 24 hours went by pretty easily actually. It took me by suprise, because normally (previous attempts), I find the first day horrible. But now I'm around 39 hours without nicotine and I'm in complete withdrawal. I feel empty and slow.

The good thing is that even though I have urges and thought about smoking, I don't really want to buy a pack of cigarettes. So my motivation to quit is bigger than the urges. 

I just have to get through the first 72 hours and then it will become easier and easier is what I tell myself. 

Stay strong everyone.

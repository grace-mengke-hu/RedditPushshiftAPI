BAD cravings when actors light up on screen

So Im close to month three and haven't had as much as a puff of smoke. I feel proud and think I am doing a good job. That said, the hardest cravings for me to resist are when I see actors light up on screen. It happens when watching movies, tv shows, playing video games anything really. I was just watching Narcos and the intensity coupled with the frequent smoking made me crave one so much. Thankfully I didn't have any around me else I may have just smoked one. Any suggestions would be most welcome but please don't say don't watch TV. I love these shows.

Smoking, Drinking and Tar/Mucus

After I quit smoking, I've been free for a month, is it common to cough up more tar/mucus than normal when I drink liquor. After ~2weeks I stopped my normal coughing I had when I was smoking and drinking Tequila has made me start coughing again. Is this normal also would drinking liquor help me clear our my lungs faster? I kind of enjoyed coughing up tar due to me being able to see progress in me clearing out my lungs.

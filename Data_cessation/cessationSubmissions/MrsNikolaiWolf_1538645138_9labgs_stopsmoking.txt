Advice Needed...

So I am trying to quit smoking, because my husband and I are trying to have our first baby together. I've been trying to cut back, only smoking at certain times and not smoking during certain things, but I keep failing. I'm still going through almost a pack a day. I need to find other ways to quit.

I can't take Chantix. I already battle depression, and someone I know who takes it says depression is a side effect, and will make mine worse. What are some ways everyone has quit?

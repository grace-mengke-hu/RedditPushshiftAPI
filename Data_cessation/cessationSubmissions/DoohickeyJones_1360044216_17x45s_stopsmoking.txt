Well, this seems like a good way to go from lurker to poster

Just finished the Easyway book (actually, I have two chapters to finish before I go to bed).

I originally was going to have have that last 'special' smoke just before I finished, then caught myself laughing at the idea.

Yes, ten minutes in and I already feel myself worrying that I can't go outside again...even though I go to bed around this time every night without thinking about that one last smoke.

I see you, little addiction, and your dancing amuses me.

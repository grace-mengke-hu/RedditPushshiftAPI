Quitting smoking and Manic Depression

As of writing this I'm on 38 days and I couldn't be happier. Most days I don't even *think* about smoking or have any cravings...its like I never smoked. 

However, one thing that's concerning me is the 'depressive' phase of my bipolar disorder...

I quit smoking before, for 9 months and I was doing extremely well. I then hit a depressive low where I was feeling extremely suicidal and self harming, I didn't care about the dangers of smoking and just went back to it because, well, fuck it, thinking about suicide, what do I care about smoking cigarettes when I want to kill myself?

Got myself to the doctors, got everything sorted and here I am again quitting. But what happens if that frame of mind comes back? I was feeling pretty low yesterday, not at the same levels as last time, but honestly I don't know how I'll cope with quitting cigarettes if everytime I hit a massive low I just stop caring about my health and end up going back to the shop to buy a pack...

If anyone here has any advice for those moments then I'd be extremely grateful.

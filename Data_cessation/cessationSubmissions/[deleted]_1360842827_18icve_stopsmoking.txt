I had a dream I bought smokes and I* didn't smoke them.

So my dream, I was drinking with friends and went to the shop to buy cigarettes. I bought a pack of some random brand I didn't know and went on partying. In my dream I went home, fell asleep and woke up with the pack in my pocket still. It was open and 2 or 3 were missing and I felt dread in my dream that I had smoked. But I can't remember smoking them the night of partying. I go to my mates and ask if I had smoked and they said I didn't and I cheered but I was annoyed I just spent $20 on the pack. Turns out I gave them to smoke bums. This was when I woke up. Remembering I had a dream about smoking but didn't smoke any in it and felt bad for it in my dream until I was reminded that I didn't smoke but got annoyed that I bought them. Mind fuck but any way HELL YEAH FOR NOT SMOKING.

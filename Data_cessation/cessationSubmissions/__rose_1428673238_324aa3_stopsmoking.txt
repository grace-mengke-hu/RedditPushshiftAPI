Day 10

Hey everyone, what's up? I just made my account and wanted to say I'm very proud of myself and of all of you. I started smoking when I was 16, and my 21 is next month. I've quit smoking and drinking. It was really a lot easier than I expected. Just a dull headache the first 2 days. Anyways, have a great day everyone! Keep up the good work.

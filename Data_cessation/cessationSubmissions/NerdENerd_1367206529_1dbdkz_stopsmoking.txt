Survived a 3 day bender with two smokers

A friend come a stayed with me for the last few days who is a heavy smoker. We drank a large amount and on Saturday night hung out with another friend who was constantly smoking. Didn't even feel any cravings. The only thing I noticed was I did a Microsoft Certification exam on Saturday and as the lady at the testing centre said congratulations and handed me my results I walked out feeling rather chipper and reached for my cigarettes for a victory fag. As soon as I realised I didn't have any cigarettes and that I didn't smoke anymore the feeling passed.

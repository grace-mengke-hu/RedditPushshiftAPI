Nicodrem CQ and Sports question

This is my first attempt to quit nicotine. I've been vaping the last couple of years and don't really enjoy smoking. However, i do enjoy nicotine. So I am trying to use the patches to ween myself off the Juul and hopefully quit all nicotine for good. 

I have a question that i cannot seem to find a good answer to online. I am wondering how the patch would work with playing sports? I play ice hockey once a week and i know for sure the cravings will be strong this week. We have our championship game and after there is free beer and pizza. The beer will only make the cravings that more significant. Is it possible to wear the patch through the game and after wards, to help reduce the cravings? I would hate to have some adverse affects during the game because it will get pretty strenuous being the championship game. i would also hate to cave afterwards and smoke a butt/vape. I was also curious if anyone has seen the patch come off due to sweat during sports.

Any advice and suggestions are really appreciated!

Thanks!

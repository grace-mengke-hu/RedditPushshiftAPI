Quit day is tomorrow 3.5.18

My mom was just diagnosed with lung cancer.  Her father and mother died of lung cancer.  I’ve smoked for literally decades and I hate everything about it.  My mom smoked her whole life,  she’s 76 now.  I didn’t think she would ever quit, but she is now 6 days smoke free.  She gave me the “action”  motivation, cuz if she can do this so can I!  I quit for 2 weeks a year ago without any NRT, but a decent dose of Wellbutrin I take for depression.  Today I have gum, patches, and a quit app.  I don’t have any friends but that’s another story.    So, I think I’m looking for a bit of support, or maybe even accountability.  Your shared experiences help a lot, and I’m excited to get a badge tomorrow, how weird is that?!

Fell off the wagon, having trouble getting back on. Help!

I've quit about 15 times, most recently for 7 months. I've been smoking now for a few months and can't seem to get the quit ball rolling again. I've quit so many times that I'm feeling kinda bored of quitting. I need to get motivated again! Any ideas?

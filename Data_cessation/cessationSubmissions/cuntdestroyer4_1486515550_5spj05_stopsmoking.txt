Day 40: Smoke-free since NYE 2017. Some advice for you guys on how to quit smoking for good this time!

So I've been smoke-free for 40 days now and it feels fucking amazing. I started smoking when I was 14 years old, and I finally put an end to it now at the age of 20. 


I had been trying to quit at multiple occasions, each time falling back to my bad habits. I've probably tried to quit over a dozen times, but I always found some way to start smoking again. Now that I think about it, I was so mentally weak before that I wouldn't even consider what I did before as an attempt to quit.


It was always "fuck it, I'll just smoke when I'm out drinking/partying on the weekend, and I won't smoke during the weekdays", which later always turned back into smoking on a daily basis.


What really put an end to it this time was a combination of things:


**1. I surrounded myself with non-smoker friends for 6 months.** I replaced most of my smoker friends with people that actually cared about their health. Beware, doing this doesn't have an instant impact! It's very subtle, but it has a phycological impact on you over the course of a longer period of time.

I understand it's very hard to replace friends or cut them off, but it needs to be done. If you're serious about quiting, and you can't, this has to be done. People will be mad at you for this, and you shouldn't care. 

I had the luck to go on a Working Holiday for 6 months, so I was able to avoid my smoker friends this way. Slowly I became inspired by my new, non-smokers that I met in the new country.


**2. I quit smoking when you get sick (a cold or the flu)**
This one is optional but it really does give you a kickstart to stop smoking. Why? Because if you are anything like me, when you get sick and you're staying at home with a fever, you don't go out for a smoke since you feel like shit. So I usually wind up not smoking for a couple of days, which is enough head start for your body to reduce the need for nicotine. Nothing major, but it's easier to think "Okay now I've been smoke-free for 10 days, why not try to keep it like that for 30 days?"


**3. Ultimately, you have to find your "why".** No matter what you tell yourself, you're not going to quit smoking if you don't know why you want to quit. I'll tell you about what worked for me:

What I started doing was I imagined myself at the age of 50. It's kind of hard to explain my thought process, but I'll try.

When a 20 year old smokes, it's kind of a "bad ass" thing to do. On the surface you look healthy, and no one thinks about all the consequences it has in the future. To be fair the consequences are usually quite far away, especially for a younger guy such as myself.

Anyways, thats for 20 year olds. But when a 50 year old smokes, it's no longer anything badass about it. It's just a shame that a man in his 50s isn't taking care of himself. The stereotypical 50 y/o smoker has a lot of physical signs that he's been smoking.

So being that I would never want to end up being 50 years old and still be a smoker, this kinda scared me. It scared me when I thought of myself at 50 years old with a cigarette in my hand, yellow teeth, no hair, and a bad cough (no offense if you reading this post looks like that).

But what I realized was, time flies when you smoke and look reasonably healthy and young. It's all fun and games for now. But it's like a fucking domino effect: if you smoke when you're 20, you'll probably be smoking when you are 21 too. And same when you turn 22. Same when you turn 23, 24, and 25. Might as well keep it going for 5 years more, right? 30 years old now, still a smoker. Before you know it, you are that 50 year old smoker.

Basically what I realized was, if I don't quit now, like this very fucking second, I'm NEVER going to quit. Because 50 years old seems far away, and it's easy to think "naah I won't be smoking when I'm 50." But you will, because as I said, if you smoke when you're 20, you'll smoke when you're 22 and so on.


I hope that made sense, it probably didn't sound as good written as it did in my head haha. Basically, I'll summarize point 3. with this:

Visualize your older self. Your 50 y/o self. Visualize yourself at an age where you can't stand the thought of yourself still being a smoker that you are today. Care about that person you are visualizing; care about your future self. Spare him the yellow teeth, the black lungs, and the cancer (and millions of other diseases if not cancer). Sounds harsh I know, but the truth is that you'll die an extremely long and painful death. Quit now, because the best part is that your body recovers extremely quickly too (google: quit smoking timeline. Your lungs fully recover to it's original state within 2 years of quitting smoking, alongside with other awesome benefits which starts showing even after 24 hours of being smoke free!)

I hope this at least helped one single person to stop, if it did, then I'm very happy. Take care guys <3

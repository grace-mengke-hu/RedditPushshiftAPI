Poll/question to redditors re: Allen Carr's Book

Just got the book after rave reviews from all over the place - not just Reddit. I don't want to feel disappointed if it doesn't work for me.  Here's my request. Submit a comment as follows:

Days since your last cigarette/age you started smoking/age you quit smoking/age you are now/times you tried to quit before this/longest you've gone before relapsing/day you read the book.

I realize a lot of these dates might overlap and crisscross but I really want to hear some true timelines whether good or bad. I am a 40yo F tryin my bestest to find something to help me motivate to quit for good :)

Off the cigs 3 days now! Have a few questions.

1. Is it normal to feel like I have a cold? Nose has been blocked since yesterday, and my throat has being getting pretty flemy. 

2. I'm on the e-cigarettes, just wondering how long a 10ml bottle should last me? 

3. Why do I keep sneezing? Is that a symptom? 

Well, hopefully I can keep this run going, this is the longest I've ever been off them in the 8 years I've smoked. Have started walking in the morning and getting up early in the mornings too has helped for some reason, and thank you guys for giving me motivation to do this, I've read countless posts while puffing on a fag. Well now I finally wanna get off them, and I can really see myself pulling through!

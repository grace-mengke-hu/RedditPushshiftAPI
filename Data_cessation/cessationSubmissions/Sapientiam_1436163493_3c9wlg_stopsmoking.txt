I have a question about the patch.

So I'm 11 days smoke free... I've been using the patch and so far I feel like I'm doing okay--good days and bad, good ones are becoming more frequent--but I'm almost done with the first box of step one patches. My question is, they're expensive and part of me thinks that I could get away with going straight to step two rather than doing the recommend four weeks of step one. 

Does anyone have anyone with experience with them have any suggestions?

Almost gave in

I haven't been sleeping well the last couple of days. I've been reading this isn't unheard of so I wasn't worried about it. Well i got out of work and passed out immediately. When I woke up and midnight I was having a terrible craving. The only reason I didn't smoke is because I smoke a very particular brand of cigarette and couldn't find a place that sold them at 1 in the morning. Now that I've gotten past it though I'm really happy I couldn't find any.

I want to quit so bad, and I'm almost there.

Hi, 
I'm a 19 years old college student and working part-time and before school,I use to work all day but smoke 10 cigarettes a day because I didn't go to school yet for a year and a half. Past month I decided to quit cold turkey but only lasted a week, or so. However, my smoking habit decreased to 2 cigarettes a day now. The hardest part about of not smoking is going to school. When I go to school, there are a ton of people who smoke, and I can't refrain myself asking for a cigarette. Sometimes when I ask they'll give and sometimes not. When they give I feel a sense of relief that someone gave me a cigarette, but when they say no I feel a sense of loss. My goal is to rewire my brain again to quit smoking for sure this week and forever if I can. Just today I smoked a cigarette and it tasted like shit and I started spitting everywhere because of the taste and I felt so tired afterwards. I know I'm almost there, to 0 cigarettes. I just have to push myself.

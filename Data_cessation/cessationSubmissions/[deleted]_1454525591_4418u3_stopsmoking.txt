I smoked by accident on the weekend, does this count as relapse or a mistake?

This is going to sound completely odd, but I feel a little hard on myself at the moment

I was at a party on the weekend. I don't drink alcohol, but I do smoke cannabis on occasions. When I smoke I use a cannabis vaporizer, but this time I didn't bring it with me as I didn't plan on smoking cannabis.

One of my friends at the party also smokes cannabis, and he too doesn't use tobacco. He rolls a "joint" with pure cannabis and smokes it in a rizla/rolling paper.

He asked if I wanted any and I said sure. So this joint is being passed around, and it gets to me. I take a few hits and realize it doesn't taste right. I can taste tobacco. I watched him roll it, and he defiantly used no tobacco so I had a few more puffs.

I asked him if he put tobacco in it, and he said no. It later turned out there was a few people passing joints around and I had taken someone else's that did contain tobacco.

Do I class this as a relapse or an honest mistake? Just wondering on whether the counter needs resetting. I didn't touch tobacco after I smoked some of that joint, and haven't even felt the urge to smoke tobacco at all.

Day 8

Alright so nothing interesting.  Made it to day eight.  The cravings are more manageable.  I don't feel like I "need" a cigarette after a meal or a cup of coffee.  The before and after work ones still get to me a bit.  Hope everyone else is doing good with their quits coming into the holidays!

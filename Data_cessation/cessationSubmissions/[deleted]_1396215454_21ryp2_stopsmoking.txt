Day 9 - Coping skills

What made quitting the easiest for you?

I didn't like how I wanted a cigarette, I hated it. 

Something that I did to change my thought process about it all was whenever I was craving a cigarette I changed it to wanting MY cigarette. I don't want anything out of my smoking habit except for the nicotine. I don't want my hair and clothes to smell like tobacco, I just want that little craving to go away. 

Thinking about my e-cig as my only source of nicotine available and just thinking about how much better I feel and how proud my b.f is of me has helped tremendously, but changing that one little thought from wanting a cigarette to wanting my cigarette has helped the most.

Over one week, and I can finally enjoy myself.

The last week has been a mental trudge. I'm super happy to feel as though I can finally enjoy myself without that looming fear of "will I ever feel good again?".  


90&amp;#37; cocoa chocolate and taking random walks have been helping.   


I keep forgetting to drink water, but I can walk by a smoker now and not look at them with jealousy.   


I feel like I'm looking at someone from the other side of the chain\-linked fence.

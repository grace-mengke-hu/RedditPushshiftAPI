Quitting causing major anxiety and depression spikes.

I'm 16 days into my cold turkey no-smokimg campaign, and I keep getting pretty major spikes in my anxiety which is pushing me into a bit of a funk. It seems to last a few hours and eases off a bit, but it's still pretty crap! 

Has anyone else who's quit for longer than me suffered from the same thing, and if you did, how long was it before you stopped getting these spikes? I'm still determined to stay an ex-smoker, but it's almost unbearable at times!

I'm free. Isn't it marvelous?

I just finished reading Allen Carr's easyway. I just reset both of my apps on my phone and finished the first mission in smokefree. I just reset my badge on here.

I just smoked my final cigarette. It was a pall mall menthol 100, and it tasted like cough medicine, but felt like it was giving me a cough and a sore throat. 

I'm not giving anything up. I'm setting myself free from slavery to an addictive poison. 

I never have to smoke another cigarette. Isn't it marvelous?

Quitting was hard, then it got easier, now it's getting harder again.

The first couple weeks were really tough, as everyone here knows. I was bound and determined to get through it, though, and I did. After that, it was really easy. I stopped thinking about smoking, cravings came less and less often until the point that I could hardly remember the last time I had one. The smell of smoke would make me physically ill, and even when the odd craving did come around, I barely noticed it; like ignoring an annoying little kid until he gives up and goes to bother someone else. I couldn't imagine smoking again. I felt like a completely different person from the me who used to smoke.

Over the last couple days that has changed. Occasionally I'll smell tobacco smoke and breathe in deeper. Cravings are stronger and frequent. I think about smoking and it doesn't strike me as foreign and disgusting anymore. I don't want to smoke anymore, but for some reason, my confidence in my quit is slipping. 

I can't figure out what's happening to me. Has this happened to anyone else? I'm really scared of relapsing. I need help; something to strengthen my resolve.

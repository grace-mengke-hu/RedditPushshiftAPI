I am strong (potential warnings for previous suicidal thoughts)

I started smoking at the age of 14 because I didn’t ever plan on living long enough to see the consequences. I lived an abused, bullied life and reached for any escapes I could. Alcohol, prescription drugs, cigarettes. I was supposed to be dead by 25 by my own hand, that was just how it was going to be. 

I messed up a lot because of the various addictions. In many ways. None of which I ever blamed on said things. I perpetuated the abuse I faced accidentally, hurt others by being too far gone to see it and nearly took my own life more times in the last two years than I’ve ever thought about it in my life before. 

I was never supposed to live passed 25. 

I turn 25 in 2 days. The plan has changed. I may have a future. I stopped smoking for two days, but cracked again this morning. Bought an e-cig with the support of a friend, round 2. My cigarettes tasted disgusting. I got this. You got this. Just because we don’t quit right away doesn’t mean we’re failures or any less impressive.

For those out there who do and have, my love to you. You make me proud beyond words.

To those of us who are slowly tossing away this monster, we got this. 100%. We’ll be there soon, guys. We deserve life.

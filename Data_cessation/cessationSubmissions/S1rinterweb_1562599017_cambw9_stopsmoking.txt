Dealing with a relapse

I ended up relapsing. I'm not proud of it, in fact I'm disgusted with myself for getting back into the habit. There was just some really stressful family stuff that went down and I just bought a back and had a smoke in that moment of stress-fueled weakness. And I was doing so well to, almost a whole month passed without so much as a puff! All that effort, down the drain, wasted completely.

I feel awful.

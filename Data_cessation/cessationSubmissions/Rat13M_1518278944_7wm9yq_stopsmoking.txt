10 days

Made it through ten days. It was getting easier, but seems to be getting harder again. Just need to remind myself I’m doing this for my family and my health. I was in the army and everyone used some form of nicotine. Once I got out some of my friends smoked. They all quit. It was just me going out for a smoke. It was time to stop. It’s been brutal. Smoked 19 years.

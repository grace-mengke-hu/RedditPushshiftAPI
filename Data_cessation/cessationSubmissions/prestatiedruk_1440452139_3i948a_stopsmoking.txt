I just had a big fight with my SO, all I want is a cigarette

My gf and I just had a big fight. We argued a lot lately. It always boiled down to me having to apologise and her telling me how horrible I am.

Tonight she told me the way I feel about the refugee crisis in Europe is wrong. That I react too strongly, because the rise of xenophobia is something that *really* bothers me so much that it can affect my emotions.

We fought about it and she told me to apologise for snapping. I didn't, I told her she has to apologise for daring to tell me what feelings are right and which ones are wrong.

A lot of other stuff came up. We just got off the phone, she called me and my family names. I told her I need some time where we don't talk so I can finish my master thesis, which is due in 9 days.

I am extremely stressed right now. All I want is a cigarette. I want to feel the smoke hit my lungs.

I want it so much. It's my worst craving since I quit.

I won't give in. I have cigarettes here. I'm going to a bar now to have a beer with mates. They smoke. I won't.

I don't know if anybody read this but it helped me to write it. Thanks, if you actually read it.

**edit:** I made it! I went out, met my friends, still craving that cigarette of course. I resisted the urge to give in (what's one cigarette in the long run, *really*?) and after 15 or 20 minutes I barely wanted to smoke anymore. I feel really good about myself right now. Definitely the right choice!

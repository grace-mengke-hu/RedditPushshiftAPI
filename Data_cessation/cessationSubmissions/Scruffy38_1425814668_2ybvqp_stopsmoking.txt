Just got back from snowboarding........

And the guys I go with smoke more fags than dot cotton on speed. Normally we would smoke on the slopes, smoke at the chalet and smoke in the bars. This time however I went as a non smoker determined not to smoke. Although Austria still lets people smoke in bars I was strong enough not to smoke as I need to break this cycle. Apart from feeling incredibly hungover I got home last night having had a smoke free trip. Oooooooosh chuffed to bits. My lungs feel lush and I can't wait to get out onto the footy pitch to show off the newer fitter version of me.

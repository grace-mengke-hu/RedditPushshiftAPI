Tossing and turning?

Seems like I woke up every two hours last night. Is that typical? Not straight insomnia, since I could fall back to sleep. Just kept waking up. And this morning, a wave of nausea just hit me pretty bad. Also... gas? TMI, I know... but a ton of burping? Is that all typical?

This does not make me want to smoke. If anything it makes my resolve to stay quit even stronger. I never want to feel like this again. Ever.

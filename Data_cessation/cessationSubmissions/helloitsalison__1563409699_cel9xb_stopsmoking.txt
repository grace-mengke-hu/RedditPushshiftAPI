A little motivation for myself (and maybe for you all too!)

I quit 23 days ago and have been really busy and traveling for work since. This week I’m finally home and returning to my regular workout routine and...

HOLY SH!T MY LUNGS FEEL GOOD!

It is honestly amazing how much better I feel during and after cardio. Tonight at spin class felt like I had a whole new set of organs. I’m officially hooked on this feeling of my body purging junk and healing itself. 

And now, some dorky motivation... 

We can do this! Our bodies and health are all we have — and we are so much stronger than we imagine. Some days this will feel impossibly hard, but that feeling will pass and so much good stuff is on the other side.

My problem with Allen Carr's Easyway

I just started reading Allen Carr's book, and I'm on my way to be a happy non-smoker. I also watched the easyway video on youtube a while ago, but that alone wasn't enough for me. 

Anyway, I only have one problem with what he is saying. In both the video and the book, he insisted that smoking is actually very anti-social. In the video it was even demonstrated that a guy left his friends during dinner to go smoke outside in the rain, alone, which I found pretty stupid example. 

This is a big problem for me, because every single one of my friends smoke. I have quit before for 6 months. Though I was completely fine with not smoking and I didn't even crave for cigarettes, the only thing that bothered me was that I was always left out of conversations going on in the smoking rooms of bars, or when my friends went outside for a smoke when we hang out.

I feel like I will miss so many good jokes and talks just because I don't feel like going outside when it's freezing or to the crummy smoking rooms to inhale secondhand smoke.

Any help will be welcome, I also would like to read any thoughts about this issue. Thanks :)  
  
  
Edit:

Thank you all for awesome replies!

I should probably add that here it gets reeeaally freezing in the winter, and that is the main reason why I don't really wish to go outside with my friends when they smoke. Also, like I said, smoking rooms are super disgusting when you don't smoke.

Some of you asked why I'm willing to go for a firsthand smoke, if the secondhand smoke is such a problem. But that's because I'm still a nicotine addict. It's just my assumption, but I think that will change when I'm not anymore. I just have these thoughts sometimes that I kinda wish to STAY addicted, because these social situations are so important to me. But I guess I have some prioritizing to do.

Alcoholic in recovery

Arrgh! I feel like I'm fighting myself to post this! I've been here before, or at least a similar situation, but it was with alcohol. I'm 8 months sober and am loving sobriety.

I keep typing a lot of details, but of no consequence. I've had so many wonderful interactions and responses over at /r/stopdrinking that I guess I just felt like posting SOMETHING letting everyone know that I'm here would be the way to get things started.

Thanks for the time! I'll be around!

16 years, pack a day, and I'm quitting cold turkey.

I started smoking when I was 14 to "supplement" other recreational activities (ahem), and now I'm 30 years old and have cut all of that out of my life - including alcohol. So why do I still smoke? I've had all kinds of excuses and none of them unique or intelligent, despite how smart I like to think I am. I've trying gum, I've tried patches, and I've tried vaping.

You know what those did for me? Increased my nicotine intake. Provided me some juice during times I couldn't smoke. They didn't do anything to help me quit because, well, they're just another form of cigarette!

So I read Alan Carr's book "The Easy Way", which came with overwhelming recommendation, and it's pretty awesome. If you're a narcissistic smart-ass like me and think you've already got it figured it and don't need to read a book to inform you - you're wrong. You're not going to learn anything new, you're just going to get a good solid dose of reality.

So I'm quitting. Cold turkey. Alan Carr IS a quack - the physical withdrawal is very real and it sucks - but I understand what he's trying to do and it works. Stop thinking about how much you want a cigarette, because you don't!

How much do you want a cup of bleach? How much willpower does it take NOT to drink a cup of bleach? What if you had to pay $5 for it? What if you were drunk?

Quitting IS easy when you look at it the right way with the right mindset! Best wishes to all of you! I hope whatever method you're trying is working for you and, if not, I highly suggest giving Alan Carr's Easy Way a shot!

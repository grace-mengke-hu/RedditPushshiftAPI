Help please!!

I've smoked for the better part of 13 years, and i'm only 25. 
  My family has a bad history with lung cancer and other smoking related illnesses.
    I come from a long line of smokers and I am absolutely tired of it, my teeth are turning yellow, I have trouble breathing in the mornings, my clothes and car smell terrible, and I'm tired of worrying about if I have enough smokes to get me through a day. I've tried to quit multiple times and get no where I may last two days. My SO is trying everything she can to help but I fear I'm not getting anywhere I'm up to a pack and a half a day and am very worried if I do not quit soon I will have some very serious health issues to over come. I've always used retail as an excuse due to constant stress of being a store manager for a company that has had more than its fair share of struggles (radio shack).
    Any advise or even how to start it seems like such a huge task that just ends with me disappointed every time. I just want to be done so I can save money and know that I have a long healthy life ahead of me.

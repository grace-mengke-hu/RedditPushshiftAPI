Really trying but it’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done

I’m a college freshman, I’ve been smoking for 5 years maybe. The longest I️ can go is usually a week then I️ end up buying a pack which I️ just did. My family thinks I️ already quit so I’m also hiding it whenever I️ go back home for the holidays. I’ve tried e-cigarettes but I️ absolutely hate them. If anyone has advice for how to quit I’ll try anything. No matter how strange it is.

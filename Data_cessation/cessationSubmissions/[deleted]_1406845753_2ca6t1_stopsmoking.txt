Waiting for the bus and this lady lights up next to me

Damn, the smell is really firing up my craving. This voice in my head keeps telling me to ask for a cigarette and a side of me keeps hoping that she offers. Can't leave the shed because it's raining and I don't want to get wet. Writing this is helping me distract myself. Words of encouragement pls I'm really tempted to go ask for one

EDIT: Made it onto the bus! Was holding my breath for most of the past five minutes. Glad to have made it through that.

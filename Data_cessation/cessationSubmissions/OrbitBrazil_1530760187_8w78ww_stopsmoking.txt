Quitting gradually

So when quitting cold turkey never worked out I took a different approach--smoking less and less everyday. In 2 months I went from a pack a day to just two cigarettes a day! Now at some point I'll have to make the transition to no cigs a day. Just curious if anyone else has taken this approach.

5 days strong, but now I'm going crazy!

I figured I would come here and try to talk to you guys before I spit out this nicotine gum and go light up a Black & Mild. This is my 5th day not smoking, the longest I've ever gone since I began smoking at 17. Thursday was my 23rd birthday. I'm proud of myself, it hasn't been as hard as I would have thought. I even went out for a birthday dinner last night, drank, and didn't give in. Usually alcohol and post meal times are my triggers. Another trigger is when I first wake up. I live in a house with 2 other smokers and right now I can smell the smoke and I want to light up so bad. I need help. I know I need to stay strong but damn, it feels like I'm missing out. I'm using my gum, trying to stay busy and remind myself that it is only going to make me feel worse if I give in. I just want one puff so badly.

I'm 9 days smoke free and I fear I'm gonna slip

I quit smoking mostly because I often found myself out of breath and there was this one day when my heart went crazy and I got dizzy from just a little bit of effort. Now, I'm pretty certain these things are not completely smoking related and I most likely lack some calcium, zinc and iron from my system, since I've had these kind of troubles before. But I knew smoking didn't help with all of that, so I just made a spontaneous decision to quit. No "last puff" or anything. I just tossed my vape in my backpack at 1 p.m. on a Tuesday and never touched it after.

Now my brain keeps finding reasons why it's not that bad to just go back to smoking. Stuff like the fact that everyone around me smokes (almost all my friends and family), my health issues aren't smoke related, my shortness of breath is because of my sucky office with no proper ventilation and my vape isn't even as harmful as regular cigs.

2 things are keeping me from slipping. I imagine how heavy the vape or normal cigs make me feel sometimes, the way my lungs fill with vapors or smoke and just kinda drown in it and stuff. That makes smoking way less appealing. The second thing is I NEVER want to experience the kind of psychotic breakdown I had on day 3 again and I don't want all that anger and me crying for 3 hours for no particular reason to have been in vain.

I am almost certain I'm gonna slip at one point tho.

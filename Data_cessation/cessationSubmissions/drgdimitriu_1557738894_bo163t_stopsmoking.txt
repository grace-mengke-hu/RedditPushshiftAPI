Want to stop smoking

Hi guys! Any tips on an easier way to stop smoking? The longest time without smoking for me was 4 days without any kind of nicotine but after that I said that a cigarette wouldn't hurt, yet it did as I was back on track with the cigarettes again. I've also installed the app I've seen in a couple of posts and set the start date to May 15th.

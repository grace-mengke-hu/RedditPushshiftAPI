Back again with a week tomorrow

Hey everyone!  Glad this place is here, it really becomes an important spot for me during a quit attempt.

Something strange precipitated this quitting attempt.  Over the last month or so, I gradually realized that no matter what brand I smoked (always lights), they were so gross I could hardly finish a smoke.  

Combined with having little money to live on, thus being broke alot due to a $10 a day habit, gave me just enough umph to decide, after six months since my last quit (12 days) to try again.

I'm using the same technique, where I get through one craving at a time, giving each one everything I have, with no thought for quitting for a month, or a year, or the rest of my life.  Just get through that craving.

Interestingly, this time around, the exact same time I stopped, I started again reading Allen Carr's book.  So it's helping re-wire my brain during these early days, despite not following the directions of "smoke until you finish the book".  And every time I lie down, I play the audiobook.

Anyway, I feel great... each time I failed, was because I thought that I could handle taking "just one" smoke.  Every time, I shortly returned to all-out smoking-- this last run, for 6 months of smoking.

So one craving at a time, one day at a time, not another puff.  I can't handle "just one".

Good luck to you all, and great job all you newer people, keep it up, and thanks to the older people who keep encouraging us all.

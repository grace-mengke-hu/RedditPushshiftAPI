Dizziness?

Hey y'all. I'm on day 3 today. I'm 25; I smoked half a pack a day for seven years. I'm cold-turkey-ing.

I was wondering if any of you have dealt with extreme light-headedness or dizziness. Every time I stand up, I feel like I'm about to pass out! It's like a magnified version of the buzz from my first-ever cigarette. It's terrible!

I'm starting a new job first thing tomorrow morning; I can't be feeling like this at my new job. How did y'all ditch the dizziness? Help!

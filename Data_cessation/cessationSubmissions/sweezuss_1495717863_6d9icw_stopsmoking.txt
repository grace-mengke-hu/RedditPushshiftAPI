My Last Smoke

I didn't smoke my last cigarette. Instead, i'm keeping it around for a long time. Perhaps 30+ years until I really can tell myself: "Hey you know what, It's time for that one last cigarette". Until then, I wont buy another pack nor smoke another one. And sure, it'll get stale and disgusting but it's better than what my lungs look like at the moment.

I recently quit smoking....9 days cold turkey

I quit smoking for 2 years then relapsed trying convince my brother it is easy to smoke and quit after.

I realized the urge to use has a lot to do with appetite. Instead of going to get pack of cigars. I ate a meal instead. Some times it took two or three. It pretty much gave me edge I needed to quit. Your brain tells you need "use" when your hungry.

Then I looked for things I didn't like about smoking. I used these as my higher power to help me quit. NA and AA Step 2 helped a lot.

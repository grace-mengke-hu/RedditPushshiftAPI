almost 30 days smoke free, 7 days nicotine free!

Can't believe it has been almost one month / one week respectively! I'm at the point I don't even wake up thinking about it .. And I was the type that I lit up before I did anything else. It is so nice to finally be free! :) I still have moments of irritability .. But it's not like I WANT a cig in those moments. Even nicer I'm learning to deal with stressful situations without cigs as a crutch. Yay!!

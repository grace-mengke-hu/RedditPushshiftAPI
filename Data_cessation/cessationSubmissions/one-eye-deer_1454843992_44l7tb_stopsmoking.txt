Do you regret the decision to start smoking?

(Edit: I hit enter too soon, before I was able to add on to my title.)

I was in the car tonight, and I acknowledged my responsibility in regards to the decision to start smoking. I also thought about how I would have never had to deal with nicotine withdrawals, be dealing with the occasional cravings/temptations to start back up again for the rest of my life, all that wasted money, and risks to my health had I never picked up a cigarette three years ago. 

Do you have those same regrets, too? I don't regret quitting, and am so happy with my progress so far. But I can't help but think how avoidable this all could have been.

non-smoker as of today

Hello good people of reddit!  This is just a commitment from me to yall that I am not going to smoke again I just applied for a new badge and look forward to a new healthy lifestyle.

I've quit before for almost a year and it really wasn't too hard so I know can do it again.  Today is the day, it cannot be delayed any longer.

Thanks for listening guyz

Almost doesn’t count

Y’all I was soooo fucking mad. So extremely mad. I walked outside of work and literally started to walk to the corner store to get a pack. I sat down for a minute cause I knew deep down I really didn’t wnt to. And, I didn’t go. I said duck the ciggies and went bk inside. Been crying for an hour and really just wnt to leave but cnt til 3:17, yep I’m down to the fucking minute cause that’s how awesome my day has been going.

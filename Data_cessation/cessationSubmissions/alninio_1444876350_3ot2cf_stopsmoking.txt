How do I avoid second hand smoking (Problem with my dad)

My dad smokes ALOT, like insanley alot every day. There is no way his ashtray isn't filled up by the end of the day. He smokes in the living room, it goes all the way to my playstation where I try to game, so I always avoid my playstation because he is always there. 

Just generally, it's so frustrating. I have nothing against smokers, hell if you wanna smoke it's your choice so go for it, just don't let it effect me because I don't want to be any part in it.

I'm so fucking tired of people who smoke inside elevators, are you fucking serious man. Holy shit, I suffocate to death in there, I just had to bring that up because today I experienced it and man it's like hell, I can't take it.

Do smokers not care for people around them? Seriously man, holy shit.

If I want to play on my PS4, I have to wrap my nose/mouth with a scarf and suffocate myself so I can play. My dad will NEVER stop smoking in the living room, he just will not. Even asking him politley doesn't help, nothing helps and I am just helpless. I'm so tired of living this life with his smoking habits and I don't know what to do.

Just wanna put it out there that I'm 19 years old, and have lived with his smoking habits for the longest time. Sometimes I skip lunch/dinner with him just because I know he will smoke after he's done eating or he will smoke before eating. I always eat in my room, but sometimes he even comes in my room with a cigarette even when I tell him thousand times not to.

Just, Fuck man. It's fucking annoying I'm so done with this shit.

Do you feel smokers have to mentally get smoking out of their system before they quit for good?

Im not sure i know how to word this or ask this but i quit years ago and i have this feeling still of "you're not done with cigarettes". Is it possible to just never want one again? i feel like the only way to do that is to answer all the  questions and solve all the puzzles you have in your mind around the prospect of quitting.   I hate how the only thing that is keeping me from smoking is the badge on my chest that says you haven't smoked in years.  
    I want to genuinely not think about it. Im young yet and i feel like if i smoke for a little while longer and am in enough situations then maybe ill outgrow it. It sounds stupid and quitting was hard and it took me a long time, but i have this nagging feeling still.  I guess i smoked before to cope because my life sucked and everything i wanted i didn't have. My life has greatly improved now and my mind thinks ill smoke to celebrate. It sounds dumb but i feel theres a whole different side of cigarettes i haven't experienced. It might only be one cigarette then ill know or it might be a few a day over the next few years.  
What I'm asking is do you have to fall of the wagon enough times to genuinely easily not smoke anymore?

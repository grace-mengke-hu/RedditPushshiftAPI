Day 4 - Help with going out and being smokefree!

I'm new here! Day 4 of not smoking. My lungs are still hurting or I think I would have given in my now. I'm going away the weekend and worried that is when I'll slip. I know plenty of drinks and dinners out will be planned and that is my weakness. Any suggestions?

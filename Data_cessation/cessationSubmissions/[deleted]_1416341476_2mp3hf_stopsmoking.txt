About saving money

You know, when I was a smoker and ex-smokers would talk about "think of all the money you'd save" I was always a bit meh. $5 a day doesn't seem that significant. I blew it off as a reason to stop.

But now here I am 40+ days in and cumulative I'm looking at $200+. 

That there is some spending cash and I intend to go buy something.

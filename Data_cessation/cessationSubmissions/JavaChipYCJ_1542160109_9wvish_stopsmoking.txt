Numb feeling on left jaw, under ear

Hi, I haven't had a cigarette in 48 hours due to a chest pain scare that sent me to the ER. I did blood tests and X-rays which came out normal. Doctors are saying it's most likely acid reflux or chest strains. This led me to give up smoking but I felt some numbness in my left jaw last night, after taking some muscle relaxants. Are these normal symptoms from quitting smoking or is it attributable to the muscle relaxants?

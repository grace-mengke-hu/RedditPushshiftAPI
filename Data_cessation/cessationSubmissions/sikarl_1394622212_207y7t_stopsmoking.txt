So hard to quit when.your significant other smokes. I don't know how to deal with it

It used to be the other way around. But I stopped smoking and got pretty far, 200.days i.think. But it became a problem between us. I felt like what's the point. I love this girl with.all my heart but if she's smoking anyway then why shouldn't I smoke. What's the point of me quitting if my partner won't? I smoked.maybe once or twice.every.now.and then. 

Now I've completely fallen off the wagon. I still go to the gym and run and bike. I just feel like crap. I don't knowhow to deal. I can try to stop smoking again but I'll see her smoke and ask what's the point. I don't want to guilt her into stopping. I want her to want to stop but I don't see that happening anytime soon... Shot. I hate this. Help.

Two years - My longest quit in 25 years

Just wanted to post about this milestone as it is the longest I've gone since I started smoking in 1994. I had a 9 month stretch in 2001 (relapsed on September 11. The ultimate excuse to start back). I came close to 2 years from 2008-2010, but like an idiot I started back again.

I think this time it has stuck. If the smoke free app had not reminded me, I probably would not have realized that it was my anniversary. The struggle is real, but so is the triumph. I hope everyone of you going through the struggle are also able to feel the triumph.

Best of luck!

Checking In: One Month

Just wanted to say, I just hit 31 days on my badge.  I'm truly grateful for this sub.  I identified within myself the ideas that led to relapses in the past, found this sub, and received adequate support to keep with it.  It is quite literally because of you all that I made it this far and I am so very grateful.  Because of you all, I now understand that I have all of the strength I need to quit smoking right here, and I am fully prepared to keep this momentum moving forward.

I know I'm far from over on this journey, but the for the first time in any attempt to quit, I actually feel like I'm in control of what I choose to do or not do.  Thank you everyone, I hope you all can take a piece of this with you in your own journeys.

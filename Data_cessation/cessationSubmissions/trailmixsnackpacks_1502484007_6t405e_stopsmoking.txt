Is it dumb to smoke a cigarette after quitting for a year to celebrate the quit?

I quit smoking cigarettes on August 6th 2016. I quit after 11 years because whenever I was hung over and smoked a cigarette, I felt even worse..My brain decided if it made me feel worse when I'm hungover it's definitely not good for you sober. 

I was a fairly heavy smoker year 1-6 (about pack a day)and rounded out to about 5-7 a day during year 7-11 (unless drinking then about 10)

I didn't even realize my year anniversary came and went but now that I know I want to celebrate with a cigarette.

Is that dumb as fuck? Would it regress all the health benefits I accumulated over the year span? I decided to ask here instead of /r/smoking because well..they like smoking over there..

3 months now ... I feel it's over

I'm 21, been smoking since I was 16 ...
Lately I was doing ~ 15 cigarettes per day and somehow I took the decision (once again) to stop smoking because I really hated to see myself not being able to run, to swim, to exercise properly. That lack of energy, of passion... And  I think I reached to a point when I really couldn't find anything useful to it, I just really wanted to end that little piece of shit from controlling my life. Not so difficult this time though, but I just guess this time i had that deeper intention to quit smoking. It couldn't affect me unconsciously anymore, control my desires.

I've failed so many times and the truth is each time sb fails, it requires twice as much energy to make the decision again. But 90 days from then and honestly, I feel great. I'm more healthy than ever, I work out everyday and reached 4km of relentless sprint. Now I'm not only energized as hell, but more positive by all means. I became addicted to healthy food and lost a couple of pounds.

Of course it is not easy, especially when you see other people smoking... ffs... but 3 months later, now all that struggle and need for a cigarette have gone I think once and forever. All in all it was a great experience to know that nothing can control me. I fcking won this battle.

If I can give you a tip, it totally worths trying to cut it. It can solve a bunch of other problems in your life that you wouldn't expect. Good luck and thanks for your time.

Weight gain and Quitting smoking.

 Hello. I've been smoke free for over a month now and i'm a bit concerned about my weight as i see i tend to gain a few extra pounds (kilos). 
 I've heard people who gained weight (a lot of it) a month, 6 months or even 1 year AFTER quitting smoking. 
 Please answer if you know: How long after you've been quit, you can still expect weight gain due to quitting?
 Thanks! Stay strong!

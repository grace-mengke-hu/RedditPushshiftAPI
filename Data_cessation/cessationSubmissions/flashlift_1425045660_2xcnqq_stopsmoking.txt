Need help!

I quit smoking over a year and a half ago, one day I didn't have enough money so I stopped. The hardest part was when the third month hit after that it just became easy, almost like a game to see how long. 

I bought my first pack yesterday. I feel so ashamed and guilty since I promised myself and my SO that I wouldn't do it anymore. We've been under a lot of stress lately and I caved. Didn't know where else to turn.

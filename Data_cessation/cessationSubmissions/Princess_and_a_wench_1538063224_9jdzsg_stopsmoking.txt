Feeling really discouraged right now and could use help.

I smoked for 3 years at about half a pack or just over that a day. I’d chain smoke, too.

I plan on going to the fire academy for firefighting this coming January. I had quit smoking from last May 2018 til August. 

I started working in my industry (not fire) again this September and I started smoking again. At least for over half a month.

I’m back to being quit for two days now, but I’m so ashamed. 

I feel like I can’t exercise because my lungs are so shot and it’s so hard for me to breath.

I’d really love to hear people’s stories about how long it took for their lungs to recover, and if they feel the same way they did before smoking.

I have until February to get my ass not just in shape but FIREFIGHTER shape. I’m a lady too, so I have an uphill battle as it is. 

I feel very discouraged and could really use hearing your lung recovery and fitness successes right now.

3 weeks have passed - I'm close giving up right now

I haven't smoked since 3 weeks, I quit cold turkey during a bad cold. So far I‘m doing better than I expected and I also had some moments of success and this whole subreddit is one of the biggest reasons I even got this far, just from reading and upvoting posts and comments.

But drinking makes it really difficult for me to resist. After stopping I maybe had only 5 cravings (which had nothing to do with drinking). It was easier than I thought. But I always get intense cravings after drinking alcohol. Just one or two beers and I really want to smoke.

I never gave in so far but right now I'm very, very close. All the time I was so afraid of failing and kept distrusting myself because I thought there has to be a moment where I‘m finally giving in. I feel like this moment is right now.
It‘s my first time quitting and I always think if I don‘t make it the first time I never will. So I‘m in a constant fear of messing up this one and only chance. 

I just drove home with my bike as fast as I could because I knew that I could smoke a cigarette when I arrive home if I wanted to. I still have my last pack of cigarettes in the drawer. I know they're right there. I promised myself I would post to this subreddit during a really bad craving to get over it so that's what I'm doing right now. 

I don't know what I expect you say, I think I just need to get this off my chest and distract my tipsy self from smoking. 

Maybe some of you experienced the same and can give some tips.

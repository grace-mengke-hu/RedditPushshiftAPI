So I stopped smoking last night

I've never actually tried to quit before, not for real anyway. I've said yeah I'll stop after this pack, but never actually followed through with it.

Since last night at 7PM, I haven't had a smoke. I know it's not a long time, but not having one with my morning coffee was fucking brutal.

Anyway I just found this sub, thanks for listening, just wanted to share.

I should add I've been smoking since I was 16, and I'm 28 now, so 12 years.

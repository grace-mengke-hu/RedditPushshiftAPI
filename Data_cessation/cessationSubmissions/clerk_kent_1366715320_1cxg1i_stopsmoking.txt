Two months

I never would have thought I'd get to two months, but it's happened. I must admit there have been times where the cravings have been enough to cave in, but I remember the advice someone here gave to another; wait 3 minutes, it'll pass. And it always does.

I've had a lot of stress over the last few weeks (redundancy, finding another job, evening class exams), and I've survived them all without smoking. If I can do that, then all of you can do it too.

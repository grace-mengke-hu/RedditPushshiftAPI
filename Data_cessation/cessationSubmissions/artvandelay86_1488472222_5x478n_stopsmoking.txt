metabolism?

How long did it take you to feel 100% yourself again - 7 months and I am still feeling sluggish + have been steadily gaining a little weight every month despite a healthy diet. I am a 30 year old woman, pretty active (I exercise 4 times a week and walk a lot). Should I get my thyroid checked?

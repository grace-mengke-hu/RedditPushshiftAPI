Day 1.

Today I stopped being a weak willed fool and took the first step to quitting cigarettes. I have felt like utter shit this past year because if smoking. I have had a constant cough, sore throat and just been out if breath and tired all the time. But the final straw was yesterday I put my wheelie bin out, I have to drag it about 100 yards up a hill, and I was out of breath. I just thought "this is disgraceful at the age if 36". 

I had recently had a biopsy and am being monitored by the hospital, but had continued smoking the full 20 a day I have pretty much smoked for 20 years now. I hate it. I'm sick of it. It's shit.

I have tried the Allen Carr thing. Just didn't work for me. Tried gum and patches and inhalators. None if them worked. I have tried ecigs in the past and just have that little self control I turned the power up high and overdosed myself until I had a nervous breakdown I ingested so much nicotine.

So today I bought a good quality but not variable power ecig, along with the second weakest liquid strength you can buy. Today I have smoked 8 cigarettes. I know it's not as amazing as stopping cold turkey. But as the day went on I didn't even want a cigarette. I usually smoke 10 in the day then 10 in the evening. I smoked 6 in the day (bought my ecig at 4.30) and then only 2 at night.

Tomorrow I am to only have 5 in the day and evening. I'm limiting my ecig to 4 puffs every hour.

I'm feeling positive !

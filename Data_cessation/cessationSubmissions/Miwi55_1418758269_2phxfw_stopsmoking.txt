Are you really going to feel better?

After over 40 years smoking, I am on day three now. It is very difficult some hours of the day. I quit because I want to break the addiction. At almost 60 years old, I fear it will not bring me much health benefits, but I wonder if one is really going to feel better after some time. I wonder because I did feel rather well while smoking. Just need some help!

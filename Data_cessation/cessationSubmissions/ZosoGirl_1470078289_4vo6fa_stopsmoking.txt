Today is MY day.

Hi All! I decided last night, when finishing my lucky, that enough was enough. I will not buy another pack, no matter how bad the cravings get. The only thing that I think will suck is having a draft without a cigarette to follow, but to avoid that feeling I will just put off happy hour for a few weeks. I've been lurking this subreddit for the past hour or so and I'm so ready for this. I'm 20, but I've smoked about a pack a day of menthols for 6 years. I don't want to die at 30, or 45 like my father did. I want to live to be 60, 70, 80, or even longer! But I know that the way I'm smoking now, and the predisposition in my family for cancer, that if I continue I'll be lucky to make it to 35. TODAY IS MY DAY, that's the mantra I've been repeating ever since I woke up. I'm excited, today is my day and it's the first day of my new smoke-free life. I'm not using any cessation aids other than willpower, I feel like I don't deserve their help and if I'm quitting it will be all me. I dug myself this hole and I will get out of it. Thank you all, I hope to be a regular contributor here and I can't wait to get some real days under my belt. TODAY IS MY DAY.

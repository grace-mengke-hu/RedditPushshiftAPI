Bad day please donâ€™t make me make bad choices.

29 days without a cigarette. No nicotine whatsoever for almost a month. I have had some difficult days in the beginning but it has been getting better.  I had a eye exam today and needed new glasses. When my husband came home and saw the receipt he almost took my head off. Screaming I paid too much. All I want to do is go buy a pack of cigarettes since he made me feel like crap. At least cigarettes donâ€™t yell or judge. I just needed to vent and feel sorry for myself.ðŸ˜ž

Yesterday I smoked a pack, from today I will never smoke again

I smoked solidly for over a year. Then stopped. Started and stopped intermittently. And then I smoked an absolute load yesterday. 


I got drunk and did something **very** stupid and spent the whole day hating myself so much, so hungover, and in that weakened state I smoked most of a pack of cigarettes. 


What I've realised is that although I stopped smoking before, my attitude towards it never changed.  On a night out, or in my darkest moments, it was always in the back of my mind that I *could* smoke if I wanted to and it would somehow alleviate the situation or make me happier. 


I want to go through the process of 'giving up' properly. Permanently. My throat feels rank, my bedroom reeks, and this sucks. Never again. This is day 1 or the rest of my smoke (and drink) free life.

After smoking for 25 years  average of a 20 ciggies a day ( i am 38 now ) i decided to quit smoking for the very first time in my life. it has been now 24 days without the help of any nicotine gum , parches or any help... the first 3 weeks were okay and i think i am over the craving period ... but after 3 weeks i have started to have massive anxiety attacks ... Is this normal...

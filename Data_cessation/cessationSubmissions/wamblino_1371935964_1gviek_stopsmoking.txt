feeling hopeless

hello dear redditors,

i have been trying to quit smoking pretty much ever since i realised i was addicted. it has been almost 6 years now. i read the easy way 6 times, tried hypnosis, etc. i know for sure that i do not like, however in a weak moment i light up and start the terrible chain again. i dont know what else to do. 

in the moment when im craving a cigarette my mind just seems completely oblivious to rational thought.. 

any tips?

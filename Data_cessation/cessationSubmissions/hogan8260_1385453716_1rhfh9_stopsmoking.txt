Ever Wondered Why Do Smokers Look Older???

Every mouthful of cigarette smoke contains a trillion oxidants. Oxidants (otherwise known as free radicals) are bad news when it comes to keeping you from looking young. Basically, early ageing — both inside and out — is inevitable if you smoke. Therefore smokers look older. The link between smoking and lung cancer is clear. Smoking damages the surface of your lungs, but oxidants damage every cell of your body — and that includes the skin, which starts to look saggy, wrinkly and less elastic. Why? Your skin stays elastic via its collagen content, which the body needs via vita-min C, a powerful antioxidant. Yet with each cigarette you smoke you use up 35mg of vitamin C. You get the picture: so it’s not surprising that research has shown that smokers actually have thinner skin than non-smokers.

Smoking my final cigarette.

My girlfriend is asleep in bed, and I'm sitting outside smoking my final cigarette. Tomorrow is day one for us quitting. Are there any helpful ways that helped all of you fight the urge to buy more? We have gum and pretzel sticks; tomorrow, maybe sunflower seeds. I only wish that I had a supply of those cinnamon toothpicks.

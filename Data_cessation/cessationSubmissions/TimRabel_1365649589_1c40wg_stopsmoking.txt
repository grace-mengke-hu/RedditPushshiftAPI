Questions on E-Cigarettes For Quitting... Please Help!

I'm wondering if using nicotine patches 99% of the time, and then removing the patch and smoking a Blu e-cigarette during the most dire circumstances is a good or bad idea? I feel as though I am cheating with the e-cig, but isn't it better than smoking an actual cigarette? Will it prolong my quitting process? I've used the patch for three days now, this is the third night and I just had an extremely intense craving, so I went out and bought an e-cig. It helped almost immediately, but, like I said, I'm worried it will prolong or hinder my quitting process. Any insight is greatly appreciated.

Today isnt the day unfortunately.

I quit for 6 months, but I started again in February and now I know I'm even more addicted. Ive tried vaping, it didnt work. I tried cold turkey, and now I'm clutching my pack of cigarettes just thinking about it. Emphysema runs in my family, and Id love to quit, but I dont know how. Help me.

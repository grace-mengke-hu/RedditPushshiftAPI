decided it was about time I really put in an effort to end a bad habit.

Like I assume many of us, I started smoking out of boredom and to some extent(until recently) continued to smoke out of boredom. In the beginning a pack would last me a month, than a week, and finally a day. I would tell myself, "I go through a pack in a day but at least I am not a chain smoker". Well, that didn't last too long. I only need one burning cigarette and I could easily smoke 4 in a row. YES, I became that guy who light a cigarette using the ember of his previous cigarette. 

About two weeks ago, I went through three and a half packs in one day. That was a wake up call because that was the most i have smoked in a 24 hour period and I realized i went through those 70 cigarettes without a conscious thought that i was going through 70 cigarettes. 

I came up with a game plan. I will only smoke a single "Black and Mild" a day. It worked for about 2 days. So now i was smoking a Black and Mild during my 30 min lunch breaks and smoking cigarettes on my shorter breaks.

So I went cold turkey on Tuesday and I am luck enough not to have those intense cravings. I guess it still too early to tell and anything from a bad work day to just boredom can trigger me to star again so here is to keeping up with the commitment to stop. If i can go a month without smoking i will take it as a small victory and continue with the progress. Baby steps at a time and i am sure reading and posting on this subreddit will keep me focus on the the end goal. Best of luck to everyone who has started, will start or is continuing to never smoke again.

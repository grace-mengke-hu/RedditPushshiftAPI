After 5 years of not smoking, I've started again

After getting to a comfort point, for some reason drunk decided I could handle to have a cigarette or two. And the next day, one more wouldn't hurt. A couple of weeks later and I find myself smoking every day (around 12-15 cigarettes). Up until now I've been telling myself it's temporary but now I'm worried I'm going to have to go through hell to quit again. 

I've bought nicorette lozenges (I used them when I quit before, they helped) but even with them I've found myself having a hard time getting the will power to use them and try to stop. The worst part is - my fiance's mother was just diagnosed with lung cancer and I know she wants to quit as well. And I feel incredibly guilty and insensitive about the timing. I keep saying work is just super stressful right now, and that it's temporary but today I finally actually stopped to realise it's not that simple and I've made a terrible decision. 

Any ex smokers find themselves in this position? What's the best way to regain that willpower that it took to quit the first time - and how can I stop this mess before it gets worse?

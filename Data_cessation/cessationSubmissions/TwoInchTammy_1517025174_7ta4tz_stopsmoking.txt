Take 3

I am determined to quit. Nearly 20 years it has dominated every waking moment, and I am done!

12/23/17, made it about 12 hours. The last pack's leftovers didn't make it to the bottom of the garbage can, and were therefore retrievable. Smoked those, plus 2 more packs (vs. 4) over the next 7 days.

12/31/17, made it until 6ish pm on 1/1 (over 24 hours) before having a cheat at a family event. I remained smoke free for 7 days before breaking down and buying a pack. Since then, the last 2 weeks and 3 days, I have bought and smoked 3 packs.

1/26/18 @ 4:22pm (4 hours and 30 minutes ago) was my last cigarette.

3rd times' a charm.

230 Days = $1800!

Since quitting smoking I've been paying the money I would have spent on cigarettes to a savings account every week. When I quit my brand of cigarettes cost $7.83 per pack where I live. Based on the bare minimum of one pack a day (though I always smoked more than that) I now have $1800.90 in my "non-smoking account"! Yesterday when I transferred money into that account I felt really great. It's nice to have something tangible to show how far I've come. And something to brag about!! Just thought I'd share...

Quick check in, and question about leftover patches.

Hello all! I hope you are all doing well with you quit! I am happy to say that I am, and I've been off the patch for about 3 weeks. I still however have a leftover box of them and I was wondering if using them in high pressure to smoke scenarios (I.E. parties, I'm a university student) would be beneficial of detrimental to my quit. I'm starting to think they'll be bad because pumping more nicotine into my system as I am close to expelling all of it might be bad. Any thoughts?

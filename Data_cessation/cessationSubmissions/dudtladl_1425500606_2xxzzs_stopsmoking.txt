[m/27] been smoke free for 248 days..

did not even realize it was this long til today lol
i went through some failed attempts at different methods and finally i think i know a little bit about how to quit cold turkey...
if anyone needs any help or have questions i'm willing to help...
i am now fighting the battle of porn addiction so that should be another interesting chapter in my life..

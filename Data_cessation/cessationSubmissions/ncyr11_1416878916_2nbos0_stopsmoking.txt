Need some encouragement.

So I've been smoking for maybe 4 and a half years. I was diagnosed with asthma and heart problems when I was born. I desparatly want to quit. I've tried gum, and ecigs.. multiple times.  I always go back to the dirty cigarettes though. I've been feeling especially shitty lately. Not being able to breath. Constant wheezing. I really need to kick this habit and get into shape. Do you guys have any tips to go cold turkey?

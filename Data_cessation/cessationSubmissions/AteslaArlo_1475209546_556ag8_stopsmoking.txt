Fourth time is the charm, right?

Each time I have quit, it's been a different reason. I need to cut back, to save money. My boyfriend hates that I smoke, so I'm quitting for him. We are going on a road trip, and I don't want to put him out. (That time, I lasted two months. As soon as we got back from our trip, I started up again.)

This time, it's for me, and me alone. I have made it to two months, I can do it again. If I can make it two, I can make it three. Three months is my goal right now. Day two starts tomorrow morning.

Wish me luck! I am sending good vibes and happy thoughts, to those in need of encouragement. You can do it. I can do it. We can do it.

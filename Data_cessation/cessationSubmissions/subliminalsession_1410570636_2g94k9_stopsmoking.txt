going through a rough patch

i think i'm over cigarettes, but i'm having the worst day, my s/o smokes and he did a bunch of shit to piss me off and i'm just sat here having a mental breakdown knowing that theres a pack of cigarettes in this house and knowing that a cig would feel satisfying right now, i already feel worthless and disgusting after everything thats gone down, so my useful thoughts of 'cigarettes will make you feel guilty and gross' have pretty much flown out the window

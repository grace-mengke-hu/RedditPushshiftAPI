This cough is an issue...

I quit smoking about 1 week ago, and this cough, worse in the mornings, is bringing up lots of brown phlegm. I know this is normal, and the cilia are simply clearing toxins out of my lungs. My question is, how long does this last? I've been smoking regularly since I was 20 and I'm now 25.

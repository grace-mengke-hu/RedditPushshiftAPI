i've quit so many times. please help.

i've been trying to quit for 5 years.  my longest non-smoking streak was 6 months (started again because of stress and what was eventually diagnosed as depression), second longest was 3 (started again because for a few weeks i had nothing to do and was so BORED that i started drinking again too, and i guess i got cocky and thought i could just buy one pack).  i'm at the point where i'm starting to ask myself if i'm even serious, which is silly i think, because at this point i hate the smell, the taste, the way it makes my throat and lungs feel, how defeated it makes me feel, and how much it makes me worry.  i don't have any close friends nearby, and i've only had a couple close friends since i first tried quitting 5 years ago, so that's probably made it harder for me to be successful.  i could really use some support.

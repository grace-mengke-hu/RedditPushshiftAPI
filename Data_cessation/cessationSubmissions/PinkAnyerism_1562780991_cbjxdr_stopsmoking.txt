Proud of myself!

Today is day 5 for me. Without going into too many personal details, I am having to deal with baby daddy legal drama. It got so bad today that dealing with all of it made me so angry I was literally shaking all over. However; I am super proud of myself because not once during this super stressful time did my thoughts even turn to "I need a cigarette." My mind didn't even go there.

I really feel like I'm going to make it this time. Everything about my attitude, my resolve and even my cravings just feels like this time is different. This is the real deal. Thanks for letting me share!

223 days, almost 8 months.

I read a post on another sub where someone talked about smoking a cigarette and I thought....it's been a long time since I smoked. Life does get better smoke free. I used to say I love cigarettes (and at one point I did, pack a day for almost 10 years) and couldn't imagine life without them. Rarely now do I think of them. I still get stressed, but less stressed :)

If you're just starting out KEEP GOING it is well worth it

I don't know how I'm going to make it through this. I quit today.

I'm so tired of being sick. I'm so tired of the smell and the taste. I'm so tired from not getting a good night's sleep because of how fucked my breathing is. I'm so tired of seeing people jogging or exercising or doing any sort of fun recreation activity and thinking to myself "I could never do that because I smoke". I'm so tired. I quit. Help me.

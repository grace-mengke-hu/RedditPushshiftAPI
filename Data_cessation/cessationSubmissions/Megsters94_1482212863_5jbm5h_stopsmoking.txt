Cigarette smoke on clothes smells gross.

I never really noticed how bad cigarette smoke on clothes smell when you don't smoke anymore. I walked by someone at the store today and almost gagged because it was just horrible.I wasn't ever a super heavy smoker but to know I'll never make anyone gag or hold their breath around me is a great feeling! 6 months clean and no desire to ever go back!!

My mother and cigarettes

Hey everyone, I might need a bit of help.

My mother had been smoking for at least 6 years (that I know of).
I used to think she only did it sometimes, less than once a week, but after some investigation I came upon the truth.

Now, she isn't pack-a-day but it's still way more steady than I previously thought.

Smoking isn't something I'm generally against; more of a dislike, but I can't help feel like it might one day take my mother from me.

Basically I want her to quit. Harder than it sounds though.

In the past I tried nicking her packets to stop her but when you're 10 you don't really think things through.
I need some advice on how to get her to stop, or even to cut down as a start. The problem is that she's oblivious to the fact that I know, and she constantly hides it.

I've tried the "guilt trip" before, and that path didn't work.

I'm probably coming off as very sly and manipulative but it seems that the only way she'll stop is if someone intervenes.

For clarification I'm in my late teens and still living at home, and my mother's in her mid forties. 

I just don't know how to help. Thank you all for your advice :)

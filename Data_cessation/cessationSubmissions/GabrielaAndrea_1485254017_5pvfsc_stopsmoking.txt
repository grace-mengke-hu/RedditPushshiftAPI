The body + quitting

I smoked around 3 to 12 cigarettes a day for 6 years and quit around the beginning of November with a few hiccups here and there (day before Thanksgiving, Christmas, and on New Years Eve) but other than that have been smoke free. I can breathe, smell, taste, and work out much better. On the other side of the coin is bad acne, wrinkles around my mouth I have never had before are visible, my skin looks gray and my teeth are more yellow (yellower?) with sensitive and painful gums. I understand the body is flushing out the toxins and tar. I am curious if anyone else has or is experiencing something similar? How long will this last? And what did you do to reverse or prevent such issues? Any information would be helpful =)

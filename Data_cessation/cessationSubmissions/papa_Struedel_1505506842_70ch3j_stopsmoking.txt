Quitting today and posting for accountability

My dad died in June and I took up smoking again to cope. I've been pushing the date back again and again (I think we all can identify with that...). It was gonna be on Monday when I got back from a trip but I just finished my pack and I feel like crap. I just wanted to tell someone so I can look at this post! Cheers

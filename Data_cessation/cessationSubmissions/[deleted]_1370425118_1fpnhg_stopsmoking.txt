Seriously dizzy after about 8 days...

Did any of you guys go through this?

I quit onto e-cigs, which I know you hate, but hey! We can't all be superheroes.

Anyway I have been seriously dizzy and light headed the last couple of days. So much so that it caused a bit of a panic attack and I had to have a chest x-ray which came out completely clear.

Anyway how long does this usually last for?

Fiending bad, feel like relapse is inevitable.

I began quitting 5 days ago, smoked 3 or less cigs a day since then (was a pack a day smoker) and haven't bought a pack yet. I smoked 1 cigarette today on break at work. Relationship with my girl is rocky atm among other normal life issues and the stress is eating at me. I've been fighting an internal battle to not walk to the gas station and grab a pack for the past 3 hours. Literally getting ready and getting to the front door before talking myself out of it, only to sit and brood and start the process anew. I hate this so much, I just want it to be over already. I just wanna be myself and think for myself, not be absorbed in this mental civil war.

EDIT: I didn't buy the pack. Gonna stick to my 3 or less a day til tomorrow (1 week) and then cut it out completely. Thanks for comments guys.

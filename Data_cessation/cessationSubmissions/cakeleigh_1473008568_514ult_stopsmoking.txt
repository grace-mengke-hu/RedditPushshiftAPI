Now that I've made it, how do I inspire my husband to quit?

Hey Guys, 

I'm 68 days smoke free and really loving it; I love tasting things, smelling things, and I certainly don't miss the constant throat-clearing hack. 

My husband and I had talked about quitting a lot, frequently and for about 8 years. I finally did it, and now I'm wondering what I can do to help him. My dentist asked "how did you quit smoking?" and the true answer I gave him was "I decided to." I know I can't make that decision for my husband, especially if he's not ready, but I'm wondering if you guys have any ideas of how to inspire him to make the decision for himself?

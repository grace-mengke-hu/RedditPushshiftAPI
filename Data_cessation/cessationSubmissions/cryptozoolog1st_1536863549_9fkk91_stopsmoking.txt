999 days...

I just walked into the 7-11 next to my house and one of the cashiers that I'm friendly with was restocking cigarette vape cartridges.  Juul I think they're called.  I made a comment about how I don't know anything about that stuff anymore and every time I come in there I see the tobacco and I'm glad I don't care about it.  Then I realized I was close to 1,000 days since my last cigarette and checked my app. 999 days.  Good enough and I prefer the number aesthetically anyways. 

I never thought I'd be here but I am.  I quit about 100 times before it finally happened and I got really good at it.  Finally on like Christmas eve 2015 I was hadn't smoked for like a week and we were at my wife's sisters house and she went out to smoke and I got stressed and decided to go have one with her.  My wife yelled at me, told me to let it go, and that was finally the last time I was genuinely tempted to smoke.  I haven't had the desire to smoke in at least two years and I never ever even think about it anymore.  If you genuinely want to quit you can and it gets easier until you stop caring.  I was a 1.5-2 pack a day smoker (and if I drank it was more) for about 14 years.  

One thing that helped me out is an exercise regimen. I ride bikes daily and run occasionally.  I love riding road and cyclocross bikes very fast and up mountains besides just going to the store or restaurants on them.  Smoking was fucking it up so stopping was beneficial to my passion.  I'm not saying you have to ride bikes but if you're passionate about any cardio related activity you'll want to not smoke.

Anyway, I'm very grateful to be here and thought I'd share.  Good luck to anybody who is struggling.  Take it one day at a time.  If you quit for a week, two weeks, a month, or more and then relapse do not give up.  Every time you quit you get better at it.  YOU CAN DO IT.

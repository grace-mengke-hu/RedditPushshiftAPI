First week. Ups and downs.

7 days tomorrow. 13 years of smoking. 2 packs a day. 29 years old.

I started really positive and kept on like that. Till yesterday. It was totally awful yesterday evening, out of nowhere, with no precise trigger. I even started to cry because of the fight inside of me. Let me see if I can describe this right: there was no physical need to smoke, no true craving. But I felt horrible for even thinking that I might not succeed, that I might lose my status of a non-smoker, that... One day... I might smoke again. And that that day might be very soon. Being so disappointed in myself (and also very scared), I cried like a baby.

I remembered one piece of advice that goes like this: go to indoor places where you're not allowed to smoke. So I went to the cinema, for a long movie.

Today I felt at peace. It was the first day during which I thought so rarely about the act of smoking. I wasn't nervouse, I wasn't upset, I didn't feel like a prisoner in a non-smoker's life. It felt simple and right.

Today has been the best day since I quit, just after the worst day so far.

I am so happy I didn't give in last evening. The victory of not smoking at all tasted so well the next day. This keeps me motivated.

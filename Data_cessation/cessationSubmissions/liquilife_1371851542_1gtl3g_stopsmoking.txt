It's actually been 5 days. Can you believe it? 5 days!

Ok, this is my 2nd attempt at quitting. I'm 39 years old. I tried about a month ago and failed.  I started off using the patch but am now on my 2nd day with no patch. I feel pretty great and am just now beginning to see clearly how the urges come in waves. This is helping me a LOT. 

I'm a runner and even just 5 days has done amazing things for my running. Last sunday i did a 4 mile run. My recorded average heart rate was 156 BPM. Today, my 4 mile run had an average of 135 BPM. That's a drop of 20 simply from 5 days. Amazing. 

Other strange anomalies: I've started to smell things much better. I've been smoking 1/2 a pack minimal a day since I was 16. Some scents  coming through stronger have triggered random memories from my childhood days. Perhaps because i've had some loss of smell for so much of my life?

Feel Real Good About It. You're allowed to!

Having suffered the self-loathing and tear stained gibberish that I experienced every time I threw my tobacco away then went to buy some more, I know what it means to feel floppy and weak like an unmotivated duck in a drought.

So even if you're only a few hours into the mental gauntlet of abstinence make sure you spend as much time as possible jerking yourself off as the real fucking Don. The big cheese of the Serengeti. You just scored goal boy! You gone buried the turkey. That turkey ain't got no feathers and now it's gone cold, lord it's a freezin' up in here!

You can now do all the things you wanted to do as a smoker. It's now actually worth exercising. You can wax your legs with the money y'all saved and if you want to do the whole body you've got the time now! Think of every minute you used to spend buying, rolling, smoking and provoking. Now all of your time is free for provoking. Try prank calling teleshopping channels that have freephone; they ain't doing things right anyway.

If you haven't quit smoking start shaking your crotch in anticipation because when you do you are going to have a ridiculously impressive hard-on. This hard-on is gunna be stroked by your own ego like a freaky south-american doctor performing auto-fellatio. Isn't that exactly what you want? Enjoy it. You deserve it. You have done the best thing for yourself.

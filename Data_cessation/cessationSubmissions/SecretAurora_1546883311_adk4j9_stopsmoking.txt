Hobbies and smoking...

Hi guys ! I have quit for 6 days now, after  14 years smoking (half of my life). Itâ€™s tuff but I am happy to see other people here succeeding. I am craving right now so I write this : I am making music for my self (analog synths) and always smoked while jamming (easy 15 cigs in 2 hours). I have the feeling I will loose my creativity... how do you experience a hobbie you did while smoking but not anymore ? Any tips ?! Thanks cheers from Amsterdam!

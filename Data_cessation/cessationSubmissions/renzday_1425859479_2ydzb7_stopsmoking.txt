Helping my cousin quit smoking.

My cousin has been desperately trying quit smoking in the past with no success. He has been trying to gain weight to no avail due to his smoking habits. Recently, he has been in to boxing with my bro and friend and I feel he really wants to quit now for sure.

I made a deal with him earlier that if he can stop smoking for week, I am buying him a burger at any place he wants. In the middle of our conversation, he tells me that there might be days that he might call/text me telling that he will be craving. What can I do to help him ? What are the right words to tell him or alternatives to keep his mind off the cigarettes?

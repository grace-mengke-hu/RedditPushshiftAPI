Memories are the hardest trigger

It’s my third day not smoking, definitely not my first try at quitting. I feel like I always remember cigarettes so fondly when I’m off them. It’s frustrating because I can remember not feeling great while smoking so why do I romanticize smoking so much when I can’t do it!

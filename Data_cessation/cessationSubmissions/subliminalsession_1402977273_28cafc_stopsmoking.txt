when does your sleeping return to normal?

i went cold turkey 8/9 days ago. i am really used to having like 10 hours of sleep and sleeping pretty sound. i am not getting more than 6 hours of sleep at night, the restlessness is making me anxious that i'm never going to get over it, it's got my mind thinking that nicotine is the only way i'll be able to get a good nights sleep :( hate it because i feel so positive about quitting smoking then i get these waves of negativity or "cravings" when is this going to stop.

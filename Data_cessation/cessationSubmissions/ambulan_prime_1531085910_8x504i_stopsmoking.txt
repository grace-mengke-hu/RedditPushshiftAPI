Was gonna stop today but now I hopefully smoked my last cigarette

I tried today but relapsed petty quickly. 


But I’ve been saying the past three days come Monday I stop.  I have a lot of pebbles from planting some plants and a jar. Every time I get the urge to smoke I’m gonna puck up a pebble and speak into it that I’m not gonna smoke again and then put it in the jar. The idea is that the jar will symbolize my restraint and self discipline and as the jar gets filled into have physical evidence of my restraint

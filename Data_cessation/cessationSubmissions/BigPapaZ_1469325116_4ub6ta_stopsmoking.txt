How do you get through the tough spots?

Hi r/stopsmoking.  Going kind of nuts right now and have the urge to walk down to the store and pick up a pack.  I haven't smoked for 7 days and really haven't had many cravings in the past 7 days at all.  Now out of nowhere it's bad and I am craving a smoke and starting to rationalize it.  For those successful non-smokers out there how do you get through these times?

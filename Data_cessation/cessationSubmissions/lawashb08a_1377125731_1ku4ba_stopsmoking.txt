Time to quit, and i've had my trigger moment.

My dad died at the young age of 54 this Sunday, and it was unexpected and really shook me, while sorting a few of his items cigarettes where found, and have been linked to the cause of his death, ive ordered the book, will be here soon, so ive allowed myself this week of smoking until the funeral is all over with then its time to stop this smoking business and get fit and healthy. 

Wish me luck guys,

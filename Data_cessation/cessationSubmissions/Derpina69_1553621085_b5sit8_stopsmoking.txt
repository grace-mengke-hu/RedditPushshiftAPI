1 Year, 7 Months, 1 Week since I quit smoking

Never thought that I could make it this far, but here we are! 

Still crave one every now and then, but I'm more happy about my accomplishment that it doesnt make me want to spark up again. I've taken things day by day with my cravings, and tell myself that it's okay to want one, just as long as I don't give in to my temptation. This way of thinking for me has helped the time go a bit quicker &amp; it has gotten easier.

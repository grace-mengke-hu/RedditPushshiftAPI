Day 3 and really struggling.

Tomorrow at 1 am will be the one year anniversary of my mother's death.  She died from a combination of cancers caused both by drinking and smoking. She quit drinking three years prior but continued to smoke up until the end. I was there for all of the care and it was a devastating process to watch.  One would think it would have been enough motivation to quit but I smoked through the stress and the loss.  

One year later and nearing my 30th birthday, my 10th year smoking, I'm facing the reality of my own mortality.  Over the last year my life has gone from incredibly difficult to nearly perfect.  The absolute only thing that I dislike right now is that I smoked.  

I so badly want to light up but instead I'm sitting here getting encouragement from you guys.  Reading all of your stories over the last few days has kept me going, it really has.  Thanks for posting and for reading.

My severe addiction to cigarettes is annoying

I used to be able to go for amazing walks. I would download a bunch of music to my phone, and zone out, buy myself a coffee, and keep walking. I loved it. Now, If I dont have a pack of cigarettes on me that is the only thing on my mind. It makes me isolate myself from people im hanging out with who dont smoke. "Be right back guys, going out for a smoke.." Its truly so obnoxious.

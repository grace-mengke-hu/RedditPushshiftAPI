I'm here to try again...

so, 17 weeks ago I started smoking again after a 3 month quit. Wish I could turn back time and didn't pick it up again, well, if I was wishing for anything, it would be to have never of smoked at all! but once again, i have found myself smoking, needed it, enjoying it, hating it, loving it, etc, all the bullshit.

but i'm ready to go again, i'm sick of feeling sluggish, bad chest, smelling and just feeling dependent. Anyways, here we go again.

Coming up to 6 months since my last cigarette but I'm really stressed and craving that cigarette

So its coming up to 6 months since my last cigarette and I'm really stressed out at the moment and I'm really craving a cigarette. 

It's been long enough that I can't quite remember how bad the addiction was (if that makes any sense) and I've been fantasising about having one cigarette. 
Now I am fully aware that there is no such thing as "just one" and I do not want to be a smoker again. But as I've been really stressed my logical side is taking a back seat and I keep thinking of ways to excuse myself of smoking one cigarette. 

I'm just a little stuck as I really don't want to be a smoker again but I feel like I'm losing a never ending battle at the moment as it's only a matter of time before I fail.

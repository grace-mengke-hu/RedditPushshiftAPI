I smoke to help my mental illness and I want to stop! I need advice.

Using mobile so excuse the formatting. 

I'm 21 and suffer from crippling anxiety+depression with frequent mental breakdowns. Because of all this I currently have no job or school. Because I'm doing nothing but feeling sad and anxious all day, smoking has been my coping mechanism for about a year now. I smoke when I'm sad, bored, anxious, after I eat, after I shower etc. I can't imagine going a day without it.. 
Anyways! I've been worried about my health, physically and mentally. Having an addiction isn't going to get me anywhere and I need healthy alternatives that'll make me feel better in every way!

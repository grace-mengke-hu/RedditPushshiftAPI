Had a public meltdown on day 3

I'm on day 4 of a cold turkey quit, assisted by Wellbutrin. It's been hard but manageable. But last night I went out to a (nonsmoking) bar with friends and completely freaked out and had to go home. It's only now clear how much of a social crutch cigarettes were. Feeling anxious? Step out and smoke. Don't want to talk to that person? Smoke. Not having that 'out' is so much harder then I thought it would be. Without the excuse of a cigarette, stepping outside seems rude. Does anyone have tips or suggestions on how to manage this? Beyond using the gum in social situations, I'm at a loss.

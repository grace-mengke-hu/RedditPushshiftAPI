I've quit... but I have some questions/concerns I need resolved

Before I can say I've really kicked this addiction I need clarity. Closure if you will.

I am freshly 22. I quit exactly 8 days ago when I was still 21.
I smoked for 6-7 years give or take.

I am on day 8 and am still having very serious cravings. Will these go away? If so, when?

I want to enjoy my 20s, scratch that, I must enjoy my 20s, but if I'm feigning for a smoke all day and night how can I really enjoy life?

On the flip side, I also want to be healthy and live as long as possible, at as high a quality of life as possible... and I know smoking will impede on my exercise and quality of life.

I know this may seem kind of silly to you reading it, and maybe so it's just myself needing to vent and whatnot, but I need some third party opinions.

If I want to enjoy my 20s should I stay quit and endure this torture or should I just keep smoking and quit in a few years before I turn 30?

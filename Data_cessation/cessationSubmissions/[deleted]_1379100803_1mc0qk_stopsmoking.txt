It's been getting easier but everyday is a constant battle

When I had first quit smoking, some days were easy and some days were EXTREMELY hard. What's cool about having not smoke for so long every time I get an urge to smoke now it's easily prevented. All I really need to do is wait a couple minutes and it passes away. I still think about it everyday though, sometimes multiple times. I'm the kind of person who will probably always crave a cigarette but I'm just proud of myself to be able to deny myself of one.

Cheers to 120 days!

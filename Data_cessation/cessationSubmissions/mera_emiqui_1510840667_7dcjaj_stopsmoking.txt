After two years of not smoking, I started again last month.

I didn’t realize how depressed and anxious I’ve been for those two years until I started smoking e-cigarettes again. I am getting along 10x better with my wonderful husband, I find it easier to get out of bed and go to work, I am happier, I am losing weight, and even the shame and guilt that I feel about starting again doesn’t compare to the daily anxiety, dread, and lethargy I have experienced for the past two years. That said, I don’t want to be smoking. I don’t want to be addicted to nicotine. I know I can quit, but I don’t want to go back to how I felt before. What do I do?

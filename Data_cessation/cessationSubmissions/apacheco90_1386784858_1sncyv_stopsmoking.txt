Just a little celebration

Today is my 75th day without smoking. now ill be honest and say i think about smoking at least once a day. i still have dreams about it. i only stopped because my girlfriend is pregnant and i dont want my son coming into this world knowing right away what smoking is. i still think that one day i will become a smoker again but i hope by the time my son is here i wont have enough time to think about a cig.

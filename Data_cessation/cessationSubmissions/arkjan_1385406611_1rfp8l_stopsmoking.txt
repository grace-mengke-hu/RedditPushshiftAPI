Breakdown after two weeks...

It's been 18 days and recently I can't sleep and shift work doesn't make it better. I can't sleep at night, waking up every hour and during the day I have to take naps because I'm exhausted as hell. I started to feel depressed, can't get myself to make anything productive. I'm close to make my decission to leave my country and I'm not sure if all of that is just my quitting depression or something else.

Did someone have sudden regress after quite easy 2 weeks?

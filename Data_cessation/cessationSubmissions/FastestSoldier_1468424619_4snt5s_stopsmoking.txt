Closing in on 50 days and the last couple of days I have had serious urges

I thought I was over this part, but no. My body has been nicotine free for 47 days and it's been going better. But the last three days I've had urges lasting throughout the day. I know they're not physical, but mental.

I've been picking up training again lately and the urges always come in strong after exercise and then stay there for the rest of the day. I think it has to do with that after exercise I'm used to be completely relaxed, but I can't without my tobacco because I'm still recovering from it. It's like a hunger you can't feed. I'm not gonna pull back on training because I need to get in shape again, but this really is an unwanted side effect. It's been really tempting to just take one and it's at times hard to resist as I live with someone who use tobacco. Every time I open the fridge I get a can of tobacco in my face. 

Anyways, I'm now aiming for 90 days. It's said that the brain chemistry will be back to normal at that point.

Seven days without nicotine! Thoughts and experiences.

So I'm now seven days free of nicotine, my body is slowly starting to adjust to not being filled with nonsense. This being the longest I've ever managed to be free of snus and nicotine. 

**Problems so far:** 

- Impossible to "feel calm" in a sense, unless I do something very proactive or ardeous I'll feel in me that I'm not snusing. 

- Trouble sleeping. I think everyone has had that in a way, it's just in many ways I've felt it impossible to get sleeping immediately. Though it's getting easier. 

- I don't have a daily "reward" -- this is probably the worst of it. When I used snus I would have something that I could give myself as a reward. Had a great, good meal? Time to snus. Done something tiring? Take a snus!  It sort of became a reward in the daily life which I now don't have.  This is what is going to break me if I don't find an adequate replacement or somehow manage to go away from that line of thinking...


**The positives**

- Purely financial, I've managed to save $185 (1100 NOK) on just seven days of not using snus. In Norway all nicotine-wares are extremely expensive and having a habit like I had is in no way cheap. 

- I feel already my blood-pressure is normaling. I haven't had my trouble with it, though I knew it was a bit high at times. But if we look past all the withdrawal-symptoms I'm actually feeling a little bit better! 

- Panic attacks. I suffer from anxiety attacks  and I know nicotine can help trigger these attacks. I'm not sure if it's placebo and far too early to tell, but I feel like I'm not as easily affected anymore. 


So yeah, seven days. Might not seem like anything at all to many of you - but for me it's an achievement.

7 days without a cigarette

I have been sick over the past week, feeling better tonight, I have been coughing up tar all day, but my headache has gone. I have thoughts of lighting up a cigarette today. Then I went over all the negatives in my mind and why Iam quitting, the urge went within 20 minutes. Time to start breathing again!

The patch

For those of you who have used the patch...

Have you found it difficult to go from step 1 to step 2?  

I'm about to switch to step 2 and I'm not sure what to expect.  It's been 28 days without a cigarette for me and it's been going well. I have the odd "cue" craving, but that's about it. A far cry from the pack a day I was at when I quit. I don't want going down a step to set me off.

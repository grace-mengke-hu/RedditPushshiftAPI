Almost 12 hours smoke free

I quit smoking yesterday just before going to bed. I decided to give myself the best christmas gift. It's been almost 12 hours in and suffering from mixed feelings. I am determined to quit smoking but my mind keeps telling me: 'Just one more and then you'll quit!' I know if I fail and have only one more, I'll wait another date that is forever away to stop smoking.

This time it is the right one, I'm 40 and I want to enjoy life fully, be able to do exercise without running out of breath or coughing my lungs out. I am also very overweight and hope quitting will help me crave less junk food. Besides, I am deeply in debts and I decided to draw my budget. By tracking my expenses, I realized I was smoking for about $400 a month. 

I'll probably be posting on this channel for support in the next few days/week. Wish me well!

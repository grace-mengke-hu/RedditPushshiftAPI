Champix/Chantix/Varenicline takes the struggle away from stopping smoking.

day 16 of pill taking and 4 days into not smoking. the drugs just completely taken away the physical/mental struggle you get when going cold turkey. im just left with the habbit niggles for having a smoke instead which are real easy to dismiss if i go for a stroll, do some chores or smoke one of my awful knaster nicotine free rose petal leaf things. 

to go from 15 years of tobacco smoking where the last few years have been an every half hour habit, to not caring for smokes at all in a little over 2 weeks really is something. i enjoyed smoking too.

i also remember my dreams from days ago.

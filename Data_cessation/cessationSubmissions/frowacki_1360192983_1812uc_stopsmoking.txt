I've been without a cigarette for 6 months now, but tried quitting with an e-cig.

So, as the title suggests, I quit smoking cigarettes about 6 months ago, and haven't looked back. I was smoking anywhere from 10-14 cigarettes a day.  I decided when I quit that I would use an e-cig to help with the cravings, and I've loved it for the most part. When I started with an e-cig, I used it maybe 6-8 times a day, and was weaning myself off at a pretty good rate. At one point, I was down to using it maybe 2-3 times a day. Unfortunately, that didn't last. Over the course of time, I found myself using it more regularly.

Now I'm to the point where I'm using a 2.4 mg e-cigarette about 10-15 times a day, and want to quit. I'm still addicted to nicotine, just not how I used to be. I know it's not as harmful for me, but it's just as expensive at this point and I feel tied to it. 

Has anyone else had a similar situation to this? I don't just want to be cigarette free, I want to be completely nicotine free. 

Edit: I just smashed it with a hammer. Hopefully that will help.

I just smoked a cigarette and it didn't make me feel any better.

I still feel just as anxious and stressed out as I did before I smoked. My cravings are still just as strong as they were before. It might seem obvious, but this is a major epiphany for me. Cigarettes don't do *anything* for me and I'm not losing anything by cutting them out of my life. 

I'm not going to change my flair. I still consider myself 7 days quit. That cigarette was an important part of my quitting process and I'm more confident than ever in my decision to stop smoking for good.

Trying to fill the habit with something else. Especially when it comes to having a reason to step outside for a few minutes. Any suggestions?

So for me, smoking has never been about nicotine or a buzz, it's all about either being social, or going outside for a few minutes when the weather's crappy. And I love it. This time of year is particularly hard when it's cold or foggy, I just crave it. I have zero interest in vaping.. any other ideas to supplement for cigarettes?

Mid Thrities male, quit for 4 years once. I am quitting again 8 years later, Winning.

The ol patch does work, but take it off too soon and your friends cigarette starts to smell pretty good.  I started working out again and am gaining muscle quickly.  I am cutting the processed garabge out of my diet and substitute cigarette routines with brushing and flossing my teeth.

get Swole, clean your mouth, and start running.  If you're locked in a cell or a shitty apartment, workout THERE.  fuck the gym and fuck the diets.   Run like a deer, eat greens like a rabbit and meat like a coyote.  Stay away from food that comes in a box.

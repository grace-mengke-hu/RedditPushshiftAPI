Last cigarette was Sunday night. But I'm using gum. Am I cheating?

I've used 4 per day of 2 mg third party nicotine gum and about a million trident cinnamon through these first three days. 

The gum helps with the cravings but I think about them constantly. First thing as I get up then all through the day then before I goto bed. I run/exercise everyday so that helps I guess.

Am I cheating?

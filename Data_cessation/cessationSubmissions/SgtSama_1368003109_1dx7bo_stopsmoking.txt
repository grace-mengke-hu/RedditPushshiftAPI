Quitting smoking... again. Need some Steam friends to talk to when my urges are getting the better of me.

I guess to help make friends that would actually have something in common, I should list some hobbies I enjoy? Though I guess anything helps. Just really hoping I can be successful this time, and in turn, convince my mom that it is possible to quit as well.

Hobbies... Well games obviously, since I'm requesting steam friends. I'm a bit of an otaku. Technology is always a safe bet, and with music I enjoy a lot of stuff, but mostly I tend to stick with grunge/rock/electronica.

I feel kinda iffy about posting my steam name publicly, so if you're interested, let me know through a PM or comment. Who knows, maybe I can help someone else at the same time?

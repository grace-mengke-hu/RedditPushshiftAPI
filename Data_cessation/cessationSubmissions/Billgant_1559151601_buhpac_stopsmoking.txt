I'm now grossed out by cigarette smoke after 11 months of quiting

I was told that when you smoke your sense of smell and sense of taste become dull. A few months after I quit, I started noticing that the smell of cigarette smoke was bothering me. It's gotten to the point where if I see someone smoking, I cross the street. I can't believe it's gotten to this, but I'm so happy. If you quit and persevere, you will get to this point, and then there is no turning back.

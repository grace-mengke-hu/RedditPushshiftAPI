From hardcore to no more...

i'm 33 and i smoked since i was 12. I quit 2 weeks ago and i'm still going strong. I not only smoked ciggies but marajuana as well, the first week was torture, all those withdrawals and mood swings. Now i feel like a new man, i dont cough or wheeze or stink, i have more money, more energy and i feel proud of myself for quiting such a disgusting habbit that i did for so long.

Can't stop smoking on weekends

I stopped smoking. 3 years. Last summer started smoking on weekends, so every weekend i am trying but can' hold myself off from smoking. Monday-Friday i am clean, saturday sunday i smoke up to a pack in total.
I want to quit this too....... 
Any advice  on how.
Something happened to my power of will........

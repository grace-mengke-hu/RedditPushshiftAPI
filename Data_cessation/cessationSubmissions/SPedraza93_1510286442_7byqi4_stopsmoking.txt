Can't Focus. One Craving After Another One

Hi friends,

It has been officially 48 hours since I smoked my last cigarette. I don't think I've ever gone this far in all my previous tries and it all thanks to this sub, everything that I read, all the motivation and kind comments, even though they are not directed to me I just feel like they are and that's what motivates me to keep going one more hour without smoking.
Day 1 wasn't so bad, day 2 absolutely terrible. I can't think of anything that smoking, I feel weird, I can't focus. I was doing computer work and had to stop because I wasn't getting anything done. I've read so many times that once I make it through the first 3 days it is all downhill from there but am I always going to be like this? Am I always going to have cravings? What if someone smokes near me? These are my scary thoughts of the moments but hey, I am still clean!

The best cure for my cravings...

I was having a cravy day on Saturday. Not sure why, probably just because it's a week from Christmas and I am trying to achieve stuff before so I can have the entire four days off.
I've read of people who suddenly start having serious cravings way after they've quit so I knew it was a thing, just hasn't been a thing for me.

So my housemate is a smoker and when she came home from work she went outside for a smoke and then came back and started telling me a story about work. HOO-WEE she stank. It was all I could do not to retch! We had a few ciders and every time she went for a smoke, it was the same. I know smokers don't know how bad they smell, otherwise they wouldn't be smoking. It was just nauseating.

So glad I'm still a non-smoker and the cravings have settled down.  

Here's to 269 smoke free days!

Went for my first run last night

I smoked for 20 years and stopped running about 10 years ago due to shortness of breath. I honestly thought that I wouldn't run again. Last night I went out for a 20 minute run. It was easier than I'd imagined and the paranoia of permanent lung damage has subsided! I thought I was broken but it appears not. I'm thrilled and anxious to go out again tonight. It is so much more fun doing exercise when you aren't smoking and it is incredible how quickly after giving up, your lungs clear and feel better!

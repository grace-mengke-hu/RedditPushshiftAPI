41 hours and I want to punch my coworker

41 hours smoke free and I want to punch my coworker. He's just sitting there... Breathing. And eating. Chewing with his mouth open. And then sighing for no bloody reason. And talking to himself. Argh!

To clarify, I recognize that this is entirely my problem and an expression of my frustration. But on the positive side of things, I don't have to stand out in the rain while huddling against a wall to stay dry while I try to kill myself one cigarette at a time.

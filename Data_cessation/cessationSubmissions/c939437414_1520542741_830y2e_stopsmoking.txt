Before I became addicted, I've decided to quit.

I had my last cigarette on Tuesday, quitting from being a short-term social smoker. The chest pains, headaches and weird feeling in parts of my veins (is this normal, btw?) Aren't worth it.

Onwards and upwards from here. I just hope I don't get drawn back into it. 48 hours have passed meaning I'm more or less nicotine free, I've got an e cig at the ready to beat the cravings. Let's do this.

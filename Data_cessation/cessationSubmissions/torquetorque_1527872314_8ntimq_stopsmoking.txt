Stinkin’ thinkin’ going on up in my head for some reason!

Not sure what’s up but it’s been a weird couple days. I had a couple more autopilot episodes, where I forget I’m a non smoker and walk around my apartment looking for my cigarettes because it’s time to have one. They last for 3-5 minutes and then I realize oh yeah, I quit smoking... and it’s a bit jarring! Also spent a few minutes in lalaland the other day: want to do a road trip &gt; always smoked on road trips &gt; it wasn’t that hard to quit I could just smoke on the trip and then quit again when I get home... aaaagh!

How strange because they say once you hit 100 days your chances of staying smoke free for two years go to ninety-something percent... welp!

Anyway just keeping it real and being honest about what’s going on, I haven’t smoked and don’t plan to, just noticing the weird ways it creeps back in.

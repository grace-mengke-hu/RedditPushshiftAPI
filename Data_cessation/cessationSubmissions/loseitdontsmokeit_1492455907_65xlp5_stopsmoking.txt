Fell off the wagon - words of encouragement welcome!

So a couple years ago I came on here and I was doing very well. But I couldn't stop smoking if I was drinking. The association was too strong. And I thought it wasn't that big a deal, who cares. 

Well, I care, that's who. And I want to stop completely. I need to make the bar a no-smoking area for myself (but will probably just avoid it for a little while until I feel stronger) and I need to say no when the guy I'm dating asks if we can go outside and smoke. 

I feel really lame for making so much progress before and having it all be gone. At least this time I know I can do it and I'm not physically addicted like I was before. 

I think this sub is great. I've always loved seeing how supportive you all are. So yay! Let's do this!

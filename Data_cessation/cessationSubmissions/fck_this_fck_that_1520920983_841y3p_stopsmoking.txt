Completed one year of not indulging in any nicotine substance

I wanted to put up a post here as I am proud of myself quitting the disgusting habit of smoking cigarettes , hookah , shisha or vaping. My quality of life has improved since quitting. I can breathe better, smell better , think clearly &amp; life is generally more enjoyable.

I could not have come this far without you guys. In the beginning of my journey as a non smoker I used to visit this sub frequently &amp; reading posts like it's been 2 days I quit , 2 weeks I quit , 1 month I quit , etc , used to motivate &amp; push me not to light up.

For folks who are trying to give up I wish you the best of luck deep down from my heart. You can do it. It's not easy but overtime you will thank yourself. It's the best gift you can give yourself.

Have a great day\night.

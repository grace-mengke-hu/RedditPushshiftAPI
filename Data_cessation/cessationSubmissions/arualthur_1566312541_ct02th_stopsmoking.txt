Coffee and smokes?

I wasn't ever a coffee drinker before which might explain it, but I came to love coffee of all varieties and presentations while I smoked.

I've been quit for two days and having coffee as I normally would is really off putting. Did anyone else find this? Or is anyone else finding anything similar?

On the other hand, I can't get enough juice or water.

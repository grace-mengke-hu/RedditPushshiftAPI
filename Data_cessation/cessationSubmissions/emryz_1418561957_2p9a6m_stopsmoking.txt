Today is the first day of my second trip around the sun without the damn cancer-sticks.

Today marks year 1 of me being smokeless. This was the best decision I made since stopping to smoke weed 3 years ago. 

But, I still get urges and don't know if they'll ever go away. But fuck it, I stayed strong through some bad and stressful times this year - I won't back down now. 

Stay strong, and thanks for this sub and the great community! Love ya guys!

Cheers

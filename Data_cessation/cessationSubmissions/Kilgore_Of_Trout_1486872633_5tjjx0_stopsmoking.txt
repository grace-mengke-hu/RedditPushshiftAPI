12 days in and am still having odd feelings

Has anyone here felt extreme dizziness/lightheadedness for this long? Also I have occasional shortness of breath and feel pretty spacy. I paid a visit to the ER because of all of this only to be told I had a cold. Kind of embarrassing but it's better to be safe than to be sorry.

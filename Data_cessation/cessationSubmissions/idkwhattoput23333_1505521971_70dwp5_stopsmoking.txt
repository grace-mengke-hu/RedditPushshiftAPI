17 year old trying to quit. Just relapsed after about 40 hours.

Hey. Im in kind of a shitty situation. I turn 18 in 8 days (the legal age of smoking where I live). I have been smoking anywhere between 1 to 2 packs a day since I was 15. Im sick of it.

Not that I don't enjoy smoking, and my health probably hasn't been affected too much since it has only been roughly 3 years, but I still am just done. I hate being shackled to these little fuckers. I do school online, and am about to graduate high school in a few weeks, and I am so sick of not being able to sit down and do school for more than 30 minutes before I start thinking about the next cig. 

I feel like I need more of a reason to quit. Cigs are cheap where I live (4 bucks a pack), all my friends smoke vape or dip. 
The reasons I have to quit right now are..

  - I want to save money towards traveling next year
  - Also, cigs are SO expensive overseas where I want to travel. 
  - I can only imagine quitting later in life would be even harder, so I might as well start now.
  - I want to prove to myself I can quit, and say F U to the tobacco industry

I just tried to quit, and made it 40 hours. When I made the decision to quit, I ripped up all my cigs and threw them in my trash outside. About 2 hours ago I couldn't take the cravings and I dug threw the trash and was smoking whatever remnants of the cigs I could. Fuck that. Fuck being that addicted to something thats killing me.

Any one have any advice? Ive thought about reading that book, or buying the gum or patches, but honestly I don't wanna spend another dime on this addiction.

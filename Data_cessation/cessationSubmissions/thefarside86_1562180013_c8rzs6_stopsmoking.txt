It's been 31 days and I still have withdrawal symptoms.

31 days ago I quit both nicotine and caffeine. People have called me insane for quitting both at the same time but long story short I had an experience the day before I quit where I was able to see just how much both addictions were affecting me negatively and so I quit both on the same day. I figured I would rather have one miserable month instead of 2 back to back semi miserable months if I were to quit nicotine and then caffeine a month after that. 

Anyway, I am still feeling chest tightness and nausea. Its been 31 days. Everywhere I read online says that those types of symptoms should have subsided by now. I'm not going to cave, but I am starting to get pretty anxious about why the symptoms haven't gone away yet. The only theory I can think of is that my body is so totally wrecked from quitting two addictions at once that OT is taking longer to heal and adjust than if I had just quit one addiction.

Does anyone havebajy guidance or advice?

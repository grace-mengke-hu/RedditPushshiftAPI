Hey all. Just thought I'd pop in and try and give back to the community a bit. Personally, I thought I'd never be able to quit smoking and now I am at 114 days! It definitely is possible, and it's true when people say it gets way easier. Although I still have cravings and still have to work at it sometimes, I really don't miss it at all (for the most part). 

Also, as a side note, I thought I wouldn't be able to enjoy certain things like coffee or beer (when I was still drinking) without a cigarette. After some time, those associations go away completely. So don't let those things stop you if you're thinking about quitting! Good luck to all of you out there.

Just tossed the rest of my pack out, I'm starting now.

I've been an on and off smoker for about 5 years now, I'm 21 years old. 

After quitting multiple times and falling back into smoking months later I've decided to completely quit. I want to make it through this time. 

I've told my SO multiple times that I'm going to quit and I've kept falling back into it, pack after pack. We want to get married and have a child. I don't want to have to worry about future health risks and the stress it would put on my future family.

So this is me saying I'm done, for good. I'm quitting cold turkey and won't give in to any of my cravings, no matter how bad they may be. 

The only part I'm worried about is my job. I work at a bar and almost everybody I work with smokes, it's a 5 minute relief that we get during our entire shift. 

My go-to helpers are always sunflower seeds and mints. Does anybody else have any good ones they would like to share with me?

Also how do you spend all that free time you seem to have after quitting? Or the times when it seems you always have a cigarette in your hand? Like when I'm drinking a cup of coffee, almost always a cigarette in my left hand with my coffee in my right. Right after a meal. Right after having sex. Just those certain times, does the craving for a cigarette ever disappear?

Edit: I failed already today. I wish I didn't associate my anger with a cigarette. 4 left though, I'll try again tomorrow (seriously).

DAE have dreams where you smoke?

I’m 27 days in to my first cold turkey quit. Everything is going really well and I’m enjoying all the benefits of being smoke free. Buuuuuut...

I keep having dreams where I’ve smoked. In my dream, I always feel really guilty afterwards because it means I’m back to day dot. Normally my gf or someone who knows I’ve quit sees me doing it in the dream which makes me feel worse. I usually wake up straight away after having one too. In my dream I can almost taste the shit taste in my mouth and smell the smoke sticking to my hands and clothes. The brain is a weird thing.

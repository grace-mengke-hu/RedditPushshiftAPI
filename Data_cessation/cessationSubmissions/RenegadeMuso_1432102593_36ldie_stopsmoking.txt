This last week....

A friend of mine visited me for a week this passed week. We used to smoke together, drink together and talk a whole lot of shit together. 

Since I quit, I haven't really spent time with her since she lives in another city. But, she was here for a week and that was an ultimate test for me. 

We drank. We talked shit, and she smoked. Naturally, the cravings was triggered. But, I didn't smoke.

In fact, I went to the shop to buy her smokes. We stood on the balcony to talk whilst she smoked. 

Not once did I say to her that she needs to quit. I thought that would be a wrong approach as I hated it when I was 'pressured' to quit. Rather, I shared with her my story and how I quit. 

I shared with her you guys (stopsmoking forum) and some of Alan Carr's ideas. I shared with her some of my experiences and hopefully my story will encourage her to make the decision for herself. 

This passed week was a major test, and I made it through...smoke free baby. 

Peace, love and prosperity.

Why is withdrawal sometimes harder to cope with?

I've tried quitting a couple of times, I'm not going into that right now. I was just wondering, what's the reason for withdrawal being much harder to cope with sometimes?

Those among us who have tried quitting more than once or twice probably know what I mean. Sometimes you can go days, weeks, even months without even noticing much anything. Sometimes you're enragingly annoyed by noon first day and relapse soon. 

Why? Is it a purely mental thing?

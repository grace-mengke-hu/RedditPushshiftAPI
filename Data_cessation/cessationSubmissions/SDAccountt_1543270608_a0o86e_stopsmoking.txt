I go to rehab tomorrow for alcohol....

But it will be the place I stop using nicotine for good.

They sell cigarettes at this facility, only problem is.... I dont smoke cigarettes, never have, and I don't want to start. I've vaped pretty heavily for the past few years, I go through a 5% nicotine by volume disposable ecig in about a day. I've read EasyWay over the past few days and I did stop for a 24 hour period this weekend but ended up buying another ecig. Honestly I'm afraid that since I will be somewhere I have no choice but to quit it will be 10x worse, but I know its all in my head. I'll update when I get out, wish me luck friends.

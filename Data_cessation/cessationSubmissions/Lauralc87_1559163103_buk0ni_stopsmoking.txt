Much harder than expected

I always thought quitting for pregnancy would be easy. It’s not about me any more so stop being selfish and get on with it... So when I was surprised by a positive result last week, having to go instantly cold turkey was so much harder than expected. 31 and smoked since I was 17 yet I always told myself “I can quit if I want” well now I want and it’s bloody hard!!! Double mood swings, cravings and first baby...

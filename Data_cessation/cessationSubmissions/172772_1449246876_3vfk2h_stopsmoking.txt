This video made me stop smoking (12 days).

Okay, clickbait title aside- here is my quitting story (12 days off so far). I have been smoking for 6 years and right before going home to New York for Thanksgiving, I watched this video-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao8L-0nSYzg
 
I found it interesting at the time, but mostly just watched it and moved on (such is youtube). It was only when I was at my parents house for a couple days, that I was able to apply the contents of the video to my life. 

The video, among other things, outlines 2 experiments on addiction.
 
In one- a rat is in a cage with heroin laced water & regular water (no other rats or amusements). The mouse is found to eventually kill himself from continuing to consume the heroin laced water.

In the other - a rat is again in a cage with heroin laced water & regular water. This time though, there are other rats around him and other objects play with- for enjoyment. The experimenters note that the rat ends my drinking mostly from the regular bottle of water. 

I noticed that when I was in Boston (where I live), I was behaving like the first rat, but when I got to NY I was that second rat. So when I was coming home on the bus this past weekend, with 3 days of non-smoking under my belt, I was determined to let this perspective help me increase that number. I smoked because I didn't like my life (anxious, scared, bored, whatever), not because I needed a cigarettes. Going to try to continue to be that 2nd rat.

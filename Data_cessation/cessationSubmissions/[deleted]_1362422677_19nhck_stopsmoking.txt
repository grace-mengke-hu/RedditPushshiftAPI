Guys, I have a few tips for those of you powering through. 

I'm too lazy to get a badge, sorry guys, but I can assure you I've been clean for 3 weeks WITHOUT major urges or pangs. I didn't read the easy way book this time, but I have read it during my past failed attempts. The only reason I am so sure that I've quit for good this time (after 6 attempts over 10 years) is this:

**i learned to love myself despite smoking and that helped me quit**

how many of you beat yourself up when you succumb? how many times have you just felt guilty for smoking? let me tell you something, you wasted that time. 

all you have to do is

1. be confident you'll never smoke again (which means over powering all thoughts of self doubt and 'oh but the pangs might make me smoke again'. No. You are in charge of everything you do. Just accept that.

2. if you slip up. chill out man. you slipped up. we've all done that. don't beat yourself up. ask youself why and chide yourself, but then buy yourself a treat (NOT A SMOKE YOU IDIOT, AN ICE CREAM OR A PASTRY) and rest assured that you will never smoke again.

3. when you get pangs, smile. i know it sounds like some new age hippie crap, but smile at the incredulity of your pangs. smile as if you'd smile at an ant that has declared war on you and then crush it because you are awesome and you have quit smoking!

might be preaching to the choir, but had to share my success. 

HI FI badasses. real badasses don't smoke!

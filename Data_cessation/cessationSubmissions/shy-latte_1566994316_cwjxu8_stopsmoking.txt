binge eating and tobacco dreams

Anyone else started binge eating? I can't stop, every time I'd get up to have a cigarette I just cannot help, I go and have a snack instead, it's been so hard I feel so anxious

Also I keep having dreams where I'm smoking, it's happened about five times since I stopped.

Anyone been through any of this?

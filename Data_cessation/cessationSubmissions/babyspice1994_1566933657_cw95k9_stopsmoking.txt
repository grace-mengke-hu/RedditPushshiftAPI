is this gonna be hell?

I've never attempted to quit smoking. Cigarettes from age 16-18, vaping from 18-19, and juul from 19-23. I go through 8 juul pods a week. I also was prescribed adderall at age 18, stayed on it for 2 years, was off it for 2 years, now I've been back on for a year. During the two years I was off adderall, I got really into learning about organic, whole foods, supplements, holistic healing, etc. I felt the best during that time, even though I was still smoking. I gained like 20lbs, which freaked me out, so I went back on this year, completely stopped eating healthy,  and started smoking way more.

I've finally decided to quit both adderall, and smoking, no matter how much weight I gain. Also going back to eating mostly plant based. I have to go all-in or I won't do it at all.

Does anyone have advice for quitting both? Would you suggest nicotine gum or is quitting cold turkey the best way to go? Supplements for mood? Anything helps!

Day six and I want to eat all the things

Like the title said... but I'm doing keto, so have to restrict what I eat, even when I mostly just want a burrito from Taco Bell. 


The upside is I'm not craving cigarettes and on day 3, smelled someone smoking and almost gagged. I am having vivid dreams, but I also quit drinking 71 days ago, so the combination may be the cause. 


All in all, feeling pretty damn good and hopeful about making it through today without smoking.

Any tips, suggestions?

I have been smoking for about 15 years and am currently on a pack a day. I have been trying to quit unsuccessfully for a couple of years now. The best period was when I quit for 4 months 2 years ago. But recent efforts have been very poor, the most I manage is a day or two. The main problem is anxiety; I get very anxious, or even angry about smallest things when I try to quit and then the anxiety becomes unbearable. I really am desperate to quit now, but dont know what to do.

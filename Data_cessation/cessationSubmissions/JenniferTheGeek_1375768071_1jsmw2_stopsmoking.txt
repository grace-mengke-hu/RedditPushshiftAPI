I'm either gonna eat junk food, or smoke. Anyone else like that? Advice?

I started smoking a year ago, just so I could have something to do when I was bored.  I know that sounds stupid, but when there's a lull in conversation or when I find myself watching TV for 30 minutes, I figure "Let's go smoke.  That's a reason to leave this situation for a refreshing moment"

I do the same thing with food.  I don't need to eat.  But it's a refreshing thing to do while I'm bored.

Anyone find that they do the same thing with food/smokes?  How do you stop one, without dragging the other into it?

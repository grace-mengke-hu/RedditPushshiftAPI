A few of the tricks I used to quit

I easily averaged a pack a day or more for 15 years. Here's what I learned:

1) You have to be ready. That's to say that you're sure that this time is your time. Quitting every other month seemed to inspire the idea that I wasn't serious. I built up my resolve while continuing to smoke until the point where I was set on quitting.


2) Timing is huge. Having a smoke on the drive into work on Monday morning as your last hoorah isn't doing you any favors. I quit on a Friday night before going to bed. That weekend was a total wash of productivity save for the fact I didn't have a smoke. I stayed in bed, slept A LOT, and watched a ton of Netflix. That gave me time between my last cigarette and facing normal life. And the more time I had seemed to give me more confidence to carry on with my resolve.


3) Know your triggers. If you are like me, my triggers were basically having a cigarette after every little event in the day: the drive to work, coffee, lunch, breaks, after dinner, during happy hour, before going to bed, etc. I had a ton of gum on hand to cope with the lack of a cigarette. The idea is to be prepared mentally that you'll face temptations and be ready for them. I learned that smoking isn't just a singular habit but a lot of little habits that need be individually overcome. 


4) Do it for you. Like most folks struggling with smoking, I've quit more than once in the past. For me, it was more to appease girls I was dating who would have a couple casual smokes on a Saturday night but didn't like that I was such a committed smoker. After breaking up, it was an excuse for me to relapse. I needed to quit for me and I finally did.

Anyway, all that's not to say that my experiences will mirror yours. What I'd like to underline is that you should be honest enough with yourself to set yourself up for the best chance at getting over the hump and to take measures to make sure that happens as something you want to do for yourself.

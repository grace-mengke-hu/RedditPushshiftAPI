I want to stop smoking but I don't know if I can

Hello,

I've been a smoker since I was 12-13 years old. I am almost 20 now.

I really want to stop smoking because I feel tired in the morning. Most of my clothing starts smelling bad after one day while I do have a good body odor of myself. My fitness is degrading. When I wake up my throat hurts. Every time I light up a new cigarette when I am alone I feel guilty. I also calculated how much I probably spend in a year on cigarettes, it's around 700 bucks. 

The problem is, I was depressed for a long time in my life. One of the things I did to keep myself calm in those periods was smoking. I always started smoking when I felt bad / empty.

I just don't really know if I can so I would really appreciate some advice from you people.

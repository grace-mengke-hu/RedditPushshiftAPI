Pineapples, yo: smoking cessation and lung clean-out

So I'm a little over a week into quit-ness and, not to put too fine a point on it, I'm not being very _productive_. I'm not even coughing.

Now the last time I quit, someone told be about pineapple supposedly being good for cleansing the lungs. No idea how that would work, but with 20 years worth of smoke damage to worry about I'm willing to give most things a whirl.

Have you tired it? Do you think it helped? Are you a scientist that can tell me precisely why it's total bullshit? I'm all ears, Reddit.

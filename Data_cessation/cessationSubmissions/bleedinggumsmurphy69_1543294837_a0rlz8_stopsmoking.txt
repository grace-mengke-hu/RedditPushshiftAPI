Day 5 and holy shit this is hard.

Hey guys.

I'm posting to reach out in an attempt to really make this quit the one that sticks. I want to hear your best and kindest advice about how to deal with the trials and tribulations that will inevitably arise. This is my 5th quit attempt and I so desperately want this to be the one. I've been a pack a day smoker for 12 years and I'm currently on the patch. I even bought a juul cigarette to use in cases of dire emergencies. I'm just looking for a healthy and safe place to talk about the bullshit that accompanies quitting and a judgment free zone to talk about it. I feel like I'm giving up my best friend and my identity. I've spent so long feeling like being a smoker defined who I am, and I'm not sure I know or even like the person outside of that. I want to hear about your routes of self discovery. The things you learned, albeit good or bad, and how you're coping with it now. And also, how I can help.

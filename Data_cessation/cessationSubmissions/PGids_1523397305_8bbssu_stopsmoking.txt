Fuck it, here goes nothing.

I'm sick of these stupid fucking things running my life. 

Girl I had been on several "casual" dates with, and I've grown quite fond of, said flat out she would never seriously be with a smoker. Also seemed really counter productive to be hitting the gym hard and still smoking.. 

So, here I am. 2:30PM today I lit my last Marlborough Red ill ever smoke. 

Got outta work, bought a vape. Feels like the bitch way to do it, but I know I can't go from a pack a day to zero nicotine in my work environment (machine shop) because I'd make it until noon tomorrow before a lost my lid because someone blinked wrong. 

3.5 five hours in and the vape seems to be doing the trick. Tomorrow morning is going to fuckin suuuuuck.

Decided my last cigarette was one hour ago

So I have been smoking for 2 years now, started as party smoking and turned into smoking because I easily get restless and need something to do. Figured I could post here to strenghten my resolve in actually quitting.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to stop the sort of need to go out and have a Smoke?

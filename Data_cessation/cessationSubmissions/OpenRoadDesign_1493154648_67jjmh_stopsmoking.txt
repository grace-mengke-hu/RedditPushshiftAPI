Is there something to the "the time has to be right" thing or is it an excuse to wait?

I've been pondering this today. Mainly because it is a particularly stressful time right now and I know in a few weeks it will be much less stressful. How important is that do you folks think...an excuse or a key part of quitting or kind of both?

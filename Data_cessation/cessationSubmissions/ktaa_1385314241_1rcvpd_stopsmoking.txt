I drank without smoking! <<happy dance victory post, come celebrate>>

I've quit many times only to find myself outside the bar bumming cigarettes every time I drink more than two beers. Well, last night I went out and had plenty of drinks and the only thing I consumed on my way home was a bag of Cool Ranch Doritos. I've always considered drinking my major problem cue and I am so happy that I convinced myself to power through without lighting up. I had some serious cravings but I just kept telling myself I was better than my addiction. For anyone quitting and worried about drinking, I recommend telling your friends to give you some support throughout the night. You can do it!!

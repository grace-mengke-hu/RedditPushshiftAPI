Missed my three year mark, just a few reflections for those of you still struggling. Also, ama

First off, you can do it. There are many things out there to help you, and I am not opposed to any of them. Your number one goal should be to be more healthy, and if that means using patches, e-cigs, or the occasional relapse, so be it. How you choose to use your badge is completely up to you, and anyone who tries to assert that people are "cheating" by not resetting their badges when they have one drag, or an e-cig, or a patch, or a gum, or whatever, is likely acting out of a feeling of superiority or insecurity. Is there anyone here who has not been forced to walk through a cloud of cigarette smokers? Did you reset your badge?  I, for example, have drunkenly taken two dips during my three years of not smoking. It was stupid, but I didn't beat myself up over it, and I spit them both out very quickly as it turns out that dipping is really fucking gross. My philosophy is that I should reset my badge if I smoke, and I almost did when I was in Cuba, and again in Nicaragua, when touring cigar factories, but I held out and didn't smoke. That being said, to each their own.

Lets look at the description of this subreddit:

This subreddit is a place for redditors to motivate each other to quit smoking. We welcome anyone who wishes to join in by asking or giving advice, sharing stories, or just encouraging someone who is trying to quit.

I don't check in here nearly as much as I used to, but in the spirit of paying it forward, I'll check in at least once a day for the next seven days to answer any questions anyone may have.

For the record, I am now 31, and I smoked from about 18-28, a pack a day at the height, but averaging around half a pack a day.

OKay, I'm an open book. Ask away.

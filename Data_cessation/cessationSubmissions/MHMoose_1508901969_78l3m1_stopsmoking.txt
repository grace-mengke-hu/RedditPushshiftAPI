How to support spouse while quitting

Sorry if this gets asked a lot but I'm wondering what are the best ways to support someone who is trying to quit smoking. I've never been a smoker but my wife is trying to quit. I want to help but I don't want to be too pushy or annoying about it. I know she bought a new pack today but I didn't say anything. She said she was not going to buy anymore. Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you.

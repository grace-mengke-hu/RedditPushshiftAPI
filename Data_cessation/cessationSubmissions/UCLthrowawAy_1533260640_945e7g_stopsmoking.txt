Just 1 Cigarette...

A little background: 
So I smoked cigarettes for about 3 years, from the age of 17 to 20, and am now 22. I haven't touched a cigarette since, but my reason for quitting wasn't exactly the strongest. I quit around the same time California raised the legal buying age for tobacco to 21, so I quit because I wouldn't be able to have a constant supply of cigarettes. I didn't want to put my loved ones through the cranky mood I was starting to get from the withdrawals, so I bought nicotine gum to help me cope.

Anyway, I've hit a rough patch in my life having to deal with family problems while remaining stoic as to not cause any more worry. To add onto my stress, I start university in September. This isn't the first time I've had the urge to smoke again, but it is the first time I've been tempted by stress. I'm just so tempted to go out to a liquor store and buy just one smoke. I know others have it worse, and that I'm still young and didn't even smoke for long, so I apologize if I've offended anyone, I just needed to vent my frustrations to a place with people that'd understand.

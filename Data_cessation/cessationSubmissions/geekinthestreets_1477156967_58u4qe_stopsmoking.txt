Finding this frighteningly easy. Worried I'm going to slip.

Hey. I haven't had a cigarette for a little over a week but I have been vaping so I can control my nicotine intake without the carcinogens. It's been going better than I expected as vaping is horrible. I vape less than I used to smoke so I started to get confident that I could stop vaping soon and that would be the end of it. However, while I'm still weaning myself off the nicotine and because vaping is god awful, I find myself missing the taste of tobacco.

I know I need to keep going and I do have strong willpower. I guess I just need encouragement. I turned to my best friend who said he was going to stop when he found out he had cancer (surprisingly not lung cancer) but when we Skyped the other day, he lit up. I didn't call him on it but that was a blow.

I haven't vaped all day (it's 18:20 BST) and I'm starting to feel the nicotine goblins waking up.

Anything you guys can say to encourage me will be greatly appreciated.

UPDATE: So the vape police have commented and completely fucked me off with their bad attitude. I was feeling OK earlier. Now I'm on the fucking edge.

Update 2: Been talked down off the edge. See below.

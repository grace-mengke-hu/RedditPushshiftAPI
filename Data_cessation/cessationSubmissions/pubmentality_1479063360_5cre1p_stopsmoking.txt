One month

Today I reached an entire month smoke free.

Just felt like telling other redditors that it will get nasty, it will be hard, but in the end, it will be so worth it. It gets easy over time, I have not had any craving for at least 10 days. Just hang in there, remain strong and focused. Remember that you got nothing to lose, everything to gain.

I have tried so many times and failed but I am determined this time round...

It has only been 3 days but it has been a tough 3 days. This Reddit has been an inspiration together with my husband. We made a pact 4 months ago, he said if he lost 20kg I would have to quit smoking. He kept his end of the bargain by eating one meal a day and running regularly. And he loves his burgers, fries and pizzas. 

Now it's my turn to keep up my end of the deal. I hope this will be the end of my slavery to cigarettes. So we can both live as long as possible with each other, that's his wish and mine.

I have been a lurker here for months, reading and wishing I was already at 1 year, 3 years or even 10 years mark. So here I am making a pact with myself that I will get there. Let's fight this nicotine monster together!

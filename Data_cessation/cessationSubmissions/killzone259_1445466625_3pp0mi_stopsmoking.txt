Depression, boredom, and sobriety

So about a month and a half ago I stopped drinking altogether, as I found myself to be an alcoholic. I can't say no to booze. Once the taste hits my tongue, I drink until I can't remember anything. In the last month before quitting alcohol, I was blacking out 5 out of 7 nights of the week.

Since then, I haven't had one drink, not even a sip. I even stopped abusing recreational drugs, which was also quite the frequent occurrence for me. However, I also started smoking many more cigarettes. While I was drinking, I would have maybe 5 a day, and a pack would sometimes last me a full week. 

Now, a pack doesn't even last me a full 24 hours. I just want to smoke and smoke and smoke. I started chain-smoking 5 cigarettes in a row in between classes, just sitting outside and contemplating life. 

The depression hasn't helped, but actually exacerbated the amount I smoke. When I'm feeling down, there's nothing more comforting than going outside, listening to music, and chain-smoking. I get bored so easily and whats the quickest way to get out of the boredom? Smoke and browse reddit. 

I can feel my lungs hurting more and more each day, but I'm so prone to addictive substances I don't know what I can do to stop. I've tried vaping, but now I smoke cigarettes outside and vape indoors. I feel like I'm smoking 24/7...


If I stop smoking now, what vice will I have? I feel like my life is getting emptier and emptier with each drag and each passing second I choose smoking instead of dealing with my responsibilities. I feel tired and sluggish at all hours of the day and smoking only makes me more tired.

I just want to stop, but I can't. I don't have the energy, I don't have the willpower. I'm lost, guys. Is there anything I can do to help me stop?

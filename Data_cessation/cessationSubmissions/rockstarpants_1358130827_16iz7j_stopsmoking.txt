E-cig day 7

After smoking for 13 years, I am 7 days without a cigarette! I have been using e-cigs, but I have had a HUGE reduction in cravings in the past week. Had some friends over for drinks last night and didn't even want to go out to smoke when they did. Thanks so much /r/stopsmoking for providing the inspiration for me to finally follow through!

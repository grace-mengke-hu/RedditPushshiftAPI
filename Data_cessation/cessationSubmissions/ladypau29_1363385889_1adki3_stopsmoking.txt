Day 5. A couple of questions.

First of all, holy fuck. The mood swings. I'm just irritable. I'll be on skype with my parents and out of nowhere I'll completely bitch out. I feel like such an ass. Is there anything I can do to make this better? Also, I've heard a book being mentioned in this sub that's supposed to be absolutely amazing and really helps people quit but I can't remember the name. If someone could give me the name that would be great. Other than that, I'm going back to school today and I'm scared knowing how much people smoke in my university. Just wanted to share my progress. I'm not sure I would be able to do this without this community.

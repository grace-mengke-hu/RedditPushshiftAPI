Has anyone else had relatively little trouble?

I haven't smoked in a couple of months now and I can honestly say I'm hardly bothered at all. I have in fact started to notice that my throat reacts poorly to being in rooms with smokers. 

I smoked for about 10 years. Then I quit for about 7 months in 2011, started again, and quit again at the start of this year. Then I started in April again, but after a month I was kind of done with it. Is this weird? I'm sometimes a little put off by how easy a time I'm having with it. 

I heard somewhere that the more often you quit the easier it gets... If that's the case, I would just like to say to anyone who's fallen off the wagon recently. You can do it! The first few days may be bad, but after that you might just lose interest in smoking.

I'd just like to mention: I'm not trying to marginalise anyone who's having a tough time, I just thought I'd share my experience.

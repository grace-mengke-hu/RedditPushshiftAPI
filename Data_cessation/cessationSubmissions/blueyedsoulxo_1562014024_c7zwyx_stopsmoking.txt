My boyfriend is almost 48 hours clean, any tips to keep him going? And when will he stop craving cigarettes as much?

My boyfriend has been smoking for 5 years, he smoked around 15/20 a day. He’s doing amazing so far and I really hope he sticks to it! Anybody got any tips for him, or any idea when he will stop the cravings? He’s just gone cold turkey.

When he’s busy he’s fine, it’s just when he’s got spare time he really begins to stress out. Any help is welcome! I’m so proud of him :) it must be so hard. I’m just worried when I go home he will be bored and start smoking again.

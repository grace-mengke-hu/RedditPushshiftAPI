How to reset day counter?

Sup guys, anyone know to reset my day counter? I did go for 6 months without smoking any tobacco whatsoever, and it was great and I was loving it. I used to smoke a load of weed (still do) and after quitting used the vaporiser but it broke and never replaced. Started to smoke a tiny bit of tobacco in joints only, did this for like 6 months too until a couple weeks ago I had just one cigarette and then a pointless one a day since then. Got my new vapouriser satursay morning and I'm starting again as my life was sp much better without tobacco

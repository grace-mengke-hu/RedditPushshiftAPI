Hallelujah to Chantix!!!

Third day on Chantix. This stuff isn't supposed to start working till day 5. It started to work within two hours of taking it on morning one. I usually get out of bed with a monkey on my back, fiending a smoke...put on my roller derby jacket over my nighty and put on slippers and smoke. This morning, I had my first one at 1:20pm. Day one, 10 cigarettes, day two (yesterday) 6 smokes, today, three cigs so far. Funny thing is, the second i light them, i wonder, when will this smoke be over? Then toss it away halfway through. I took a 3 hour shopping jaunt through Borough Park today, and I did not realize i had forgotten my box of cigs on the dresser.

Day 8 smoke free. Relapsed kinda???

Iâ€™ve been nicotine free for 8 days and life has been amazing.. skin has been getting healthier.. teeth whiter.. depression 100% gone. Blood flow better.. last night I was on my way to a party with a friend and took 2 puffs of his blunt filled with weed... does that count as breaking my smoke free streak and set me back? Or will my nicotine free symptoms still continue to get regardless of me taking 2 hits of weed. Thanks!

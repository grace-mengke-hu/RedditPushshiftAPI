On the verge of quitting smoking...

I've been trying to quit smoking for YEARS. Every time I go to the doctor for a checkup I hear the same story....but we all know how difficult it can be to kick the habit. Anyone of this forum quit smoking and start vaping? I've been reading a lot about it lately, but still a little skeptical on the pros and cons. I saw this blog post: http://vapepens.kinja.com/why-you-should-put-the-cigarette-down-and-start-vaping-1747346825 and it got me thinking, "Vaping has to be better than cigarettes..." but I guess ANYTHING for that matter is better than cigs.

Anyone a vapor here?

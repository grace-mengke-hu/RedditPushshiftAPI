Almost got me

Coming up on 6 days today and ran across a heavy smoker while at work. Little voice nagging at me to ask for a spare. Was able to finish up and get back to my car for a new piece of gum before too long but I felt pretty good not going for it. Being around smoke seems like a big trigger for me.

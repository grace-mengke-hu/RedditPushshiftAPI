This is the day

I am embarrassed I am making the vow _again_, but here goes: Today is the day. I hope and pray I can kick this addiction for good.

My struggles have been junkie thoughts: just one, half a cig is ok, not today, etc.

I also live with a smoker, which is tricky.

I _know_ how wonderful it will be as a nonsmoker. I feel it more than ever today. 

Minute by minute. Hour by hour. Send me strength.

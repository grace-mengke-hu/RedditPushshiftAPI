Day 2, I’m feeling good.

Yesterday was okay. I got a little bitchy at work and I don’t think I’ve ever eaten so many potato chips in a single day, but I made it through.

Day 2 went really well. I keep thinking “I should light up a cigarette”, and then I remind myself that I don’t do that anymore. EVERYTHING SMELLS again, and my breathing is improving. 

I’m not sure what to do on my breaks and lunch at work. I bought a bunch of snacks last night for work. Cherries are particularly good, and not too expensive this time of year. Picking the stem off and spitting the pit out feels like it occupies my hands.

I get a monster craving when I leave work, but other than that it’s not too bad. I feel a little dizzy and I’m a bit constipated, but so far this isn’t bad.

I think I finally fully realized how truly awful and disgusting smoking is, so when I experience some effect of quitting, I’m happy. I have to deal with this, fine, but it’s worth it to not smoke.

Two weeks today!

I was essentially forced to quit so that I could buy life insurance. It's been two weeks and I feel pretty good. The first 3-4 days were definitely the toughest. It already feels like it's been forever since my last cigarette. 

What was unexpected was not craving a smoke when I see someone else smoking. That was almost always a trigger in the past. 

Anyway, onwards and upwards!

I am committed to never take another puff

I got 58 days on my last quit. My relapse started with one single puff. Every relapse has to start with one single puff. 

I'm 12 days again now after being "out there again" for 3 months. 

I am immersing myself daily in cessation literature and videos. I am NOT using NRT as I sincerely believe this is not the answer if we want to be nicotine free. And the only way to be nicotine free is to become 100% nicotine abstinent. 

It doesn't really matter to me now, how painful any craving is. I know that any potential  emotional roller coaster of withdrawal is NOTHING compared to the possible roller coaster of being diagnosed with a serious medical complication. Such a diagnosis would be an emotional roller coaster for my children wife and family too. 

However, my total surrender, this time, is actually making it easier. I have surrendered, I guess, to the fact that I WILL get periodic withdrawals, they WILL be uncomfortable, and that's it. If I try to negotiate with one single puff, if I try to take up the gauntlet and imagine that I can match the power of addiction and take one puff, I  am doomed to full relapse. From THAT point my chances are greatly reduced and I may never get the resolve needed to quit all over again. In effect, one puff is potentially deadly. 

This is my thinking right now. It is my commitment to never take another puff. It is my total surrender to the truth that I am a nicotine addict. It is my total acceptance that I am not fighting 1000 cigarettes. I am fighting 1 single puff.

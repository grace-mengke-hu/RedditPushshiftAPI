Help?

Hi guys... I have a nasty habit of smoking. 

I'm a somewhat active young man, I practice sports everyday and eat really healthy, but I've been smoking for about 2-3 years and I just want to end it now. 

I don't remember what it was like before I began smoking. I'm under a lot of stress atm, between working two jobs, learning to code and trying to immigrate, the only thing keeping me sane is the 5-minute break to smoke at the turn of every hour. 

But I'm becoming really restless, I know I can only smoke for so long before I begin to feel the effects. I don't want to jeopardize my health for this silly addiction. Now a days it doesn't even feel good anymore, it's just unpleasant but also a relief. I know I have specific triggers throughout the day: walking to the subway, while cooking, if I find a coding problem I can't solve, at work constantly.  

I've set up the 2nd of April as the date I'm quitting, but I'm scared of not being able to keep up with it... can anyone share some tips with me?

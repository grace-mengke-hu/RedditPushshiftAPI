Day 3. Anyone else experience tongue and lip sensitivity/pain?

Finally kicking the habit as of Saturday night! Feels great to be so motivated towards this goal as I never have been before. Does anyone else experience an almost painful sensation around their mouth for the first few days of quitting? Assuming it is the blood finally returning to my face or something along those lines, but wondering if anyone has any other advice on what this is and when it may stop? Thank you so much everyone on this subreddit! You all make my goal seem like a reality! :D

Fear of gaining weight

Pretty much as the title says, my only fear why I still smoke is that I will gain weight. And I know it sounds soooo stupid because weight gain is nothing compared to other health issues that cigarettes cause. I’m fully ready to quit. I realized that I don’t even like it there’s nothing special to it and so on. But the weight gain. And yeah I know that if I control my eating I probably won’t gain a lot of weight but I’ve been struggling with binge eating a lot for the past 2 years. It’s like a never ending cycle that I can’t seem to get out of.

Celebrating 6 years smoke free tomorrow on my father's birthday.

Like the title says after 12 years of addiction. I decided to quit cold turkey 6 years ago. I chose to cut cigarettes out of my life like many of you. Not just because of the self-loathing and disgust they had fostered in me. But for my wife, and parents, and for my younger brother as well. He has since quit also.

You are worth it, and it gets easier. One day at a time.

Quit Stats : 2189 days, 54,741 coffin nails avoided, and just over 16 grand "saved".

How long do you feel like poop?

Alright so a bit of background. I have been smoking for a little over 7 years. The reason I started is I have a stomach condition that causes me to wake up nauseous/needing to vomit everyday, and tobacco + marijuana was the one thing that would stop the nausea. I have never smoked a cigarette, hookah yes, and I have never smoked more than two cigs worth of tobacco a day. I quit on the 30th of Dec because my stomach is about the same, and I felt like I was starting to smoke more and more, which I don't want. 

My main question is how long should I expect the withdrawls to be affecting my body? I felt real weird for the first four days or so, but now I feel about the same as before. Obviously just stopping smoking isn't going to fix my problem,  but I had hoped it would/will make me feel better at some point.

Nothing specific, just support and advice?

In on day three now-- what actually came up was some financial trouble, and I'm using it to quit; which seems to be working a little better, because, tempted as I am, I can't afford cigarettes, so I can't cave. 

This is my second intentional attempt to quit (I quit a few years ago, because I was on bupropion as an anti-depressant, but it wasn't good for my mental health, and I eventually picked up the habit again), and, although I made it a few months last time, I do feel more positive about this attempt, as I no longer live with smokers, which caused me issues before.

The two things which are causing me concern: I am eating noticeably more, which I did expect (I lead a fairly active lifestyle, and can mostly accommodate), but I'm so broke; I can't afford to keep this up! 

I am *irritable*-- personality flaw in general, whether smoking or not, but it's definitely more pronounced. I'm taking the time to not socialize, but I have two kittens, and they are driving me *up the wall*. I'd prefer to avoid animal abuse if possible, because I'd never forgive myself if I lost my temper with them.

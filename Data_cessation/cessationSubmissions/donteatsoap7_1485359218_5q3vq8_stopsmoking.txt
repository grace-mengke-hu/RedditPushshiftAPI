ADHD and smoking

While I was never diagnosed with ADHD, I do in fact have a hard time concentrating on tasks, such as work (and apparently typing right now). I get really confused and distracted. Anyways, I've been trying to quit smoking for a long time now and I noticed that I would feel this way periodically. I just now linked to two together. Every time (including today) I try to quit smoking, I get really confused and light headed. I also misspelled a lot of these words, ty autocorrect, lol. Sorry if I'm rambling, but I was wondering if I guess right and if the two are linked for anyone else.

Two months baby, oh yeaaaah!

You guys are awesome. I feel great. 

I'm not gonna lie, sometimes I still miss smoking and I fantasize about smoking a cigarette with some liquor on my balcony. But I don't do it, because as I said before, 5 minutes of pleasure are not worth ruining two months of progress.

EDIT: I don't have cravings in the traditional meaning, what I do have is a fantasy, you know, just a thought about having a smoke, not a craving. 

Something like "A cigarette right now would be nice" and not like "Oh god, I want a cigarette so god damn much!!!"

I wish you guys luck and I hope you make it that long too, I want you to see how awesome it is.

18 to go

Now that I can go two hours without a craving I'm finally calling my current pack my last pack.


I just downloaded a counter on my phone so that I can keep track of every time I conquer a craving. Somebody posted recently that cravings will occur and end whether you give in to them or not. No idea who said it: but it gave me the guts to quit. I also downloaded quit from the android market so that I can keep track of my stress and urge to smoke whenever I give in to a craving.

I also gave my husband fair warning, and asked that he not smoke in our bedroom any more once this pack is gone. He said yes! I'm really hoping he stays supportive. I'm living in a house with 4 other indoor smokers so this is going to be a challenge. I need all the support I can get

Tl;dr? Long time lurker finally grew some classy feminine balls and is calling her current pack her last pack. What helped you with your first few days of quitting?

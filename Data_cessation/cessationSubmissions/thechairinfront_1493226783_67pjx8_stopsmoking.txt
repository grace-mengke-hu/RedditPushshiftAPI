I want to quit but I have no will power.

Like the title says I know I should quit. I want to quit, but at the same time I don't want to quit. I work from home and am alone most of the day and I wouldn't be able to keep myself from just going out and smoking. I've been smoking for 16 years. I told my husband if I do quit I'm going to need him to take a week off work and tie me to a chair. I don't even know how to begin.

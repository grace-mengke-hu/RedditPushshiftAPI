When does it start getting easy?

I see so many people here, and I'm in awe at the length of time some of you have been off the tobacco. What I've got to say is, is it easier for you? Does it ever get easy? Do any of you never get cravings any more, or do they never stop?

EDIT: I must add that I wholly understand it will not "get easy" for me any time soon, having only been going for 6 days.

I’m struggling to quit, so close yet so far

Hi, long time lurker, so sorry if structure is wrong 

I am really struggling to quit, I’ve managed to cut back from 20 to 1 a day, but I just can’t seem to just stop completely. I’ve been smoking for 7 years or so now and I just can’t seem to cut it out, the addiction is real. 

I’m on the niquitin gum, going to the gym again and trying really hard to finish but I just can’t. I was hoping that some of you guys would have some tips and other ways to stop it once and for all. I’m starting a new job on Wednesday and want to be the best me for the role and for my family, so any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks

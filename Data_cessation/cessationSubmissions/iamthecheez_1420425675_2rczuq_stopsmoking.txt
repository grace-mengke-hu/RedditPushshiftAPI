So happy and so thankful!

So I've basically been a lurker on this sub-reddit, but you guys are the best! Joining this community was the best thing I've done when it comes to quitting, and I cannot believe it is 6 months nicotine-free. Just wanted to say it feels so good and thank you to anyone who has shared his or her story, as it has helped me and I'm sure so many other people in our goal to quit smoking! The positive energy here is such a good thing to come to, and truly I appreciate all of it! :)

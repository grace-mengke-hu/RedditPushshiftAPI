Right, here we go

Just put out my last cig again, I justcan't carry on, they make me feel so shit. I gave up for 3 months but started again and been smoking the last month. They are definitely a contributing factor to my anxiety and they make it worse. So here goes, no more excuses. My girlfriend is also quiting now as well, so at least I have someone along the way.

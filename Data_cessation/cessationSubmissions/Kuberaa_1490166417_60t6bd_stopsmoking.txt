Completed over 155 hours smoke free!! Need suggestions.

Hey guys, I just completed over 6 days smoke free. I quit cold turkey and didn't had even one puff since I quit. I thank you all for all your support as these 6 days were like hell. Every second felt like an year and all I have on my mind were cigarettes and nothing more. I started studying for GMAT a month ago but since I quit cigarettes I haven't been  able to study or do something productive. I just pass time at work too and try to sit idle not thinking about cigarettes. I usually go out to the smoking area with my  smoking buddies and have cold drink or candies there. Now that I've been 6 days smoke free there are thoughts in my mind to try e-cigarettes. What do you guys think and suggest? Should I try it? On the other hand I'm wondering now that I'm already nicotine free so I should avoid it. Please suggest I need to clear up my mind. Should I try it or should I not?

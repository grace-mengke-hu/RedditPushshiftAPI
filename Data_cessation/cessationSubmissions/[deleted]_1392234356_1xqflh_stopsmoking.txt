wtf is wrong with me

I'm on day 3 of my quit, things are going ok.  I was reading in an article about the health effects of tobacco that, "On average, nonsmokers live about a decade longer than smokers".  I read that and think to myself, "a decade is not THAT long.  maybe i should just continue smoking".  I cant believe I value this shit over ten years of extra life, its crazy how strong addiction is

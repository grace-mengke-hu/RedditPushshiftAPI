Almost made it through the work day.

I have like an hour left at work and I am sitting next to a smoker.

I could so easily ask him for one.

But I won't. Today is the first hard day.

I've smoked a pack a day for almost 10 years, quit for weeks at a time before but never stuck with it. This time is gonna be different. Right guys?

FUCK smoking: part idontcareanymore.

I've been pissed as hell the past 2 days having ridiculous cravings and I finally got through it. WOW, I feel good again. People on here have been really supportive -- if you're afraid of asking for help, these posts got me through it recently:

Don't be afraid to ask for help. Redditors are friendly people, your friends and family can be friendly and supportive people too.

Quit something you love when you stop smoking.

I've been smoke free for over 1000 days. I tried and tried and tried hundreds of times to stop, but I always gave in. Along with reading Easy Way, I decided to give up something I loved, that wasn't necessarily bad for me but wasn't good for me either - I gave up eating Meat for 3 months.

Now I didn't stop it for health or ethical reasons, I stopped it because I loved it. And I forced myself to think about how much I missed it every day. Honestly, Giving up meat was much harder than smoking, I didn't even THINK of smoking, all I could think of was eating a bacon burger.

Give it a shot, and for those of you who are 2 weeks in (new year resolution people) keep it up. Any kind of physical craving you ever had is now long gone.

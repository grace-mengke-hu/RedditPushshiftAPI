I quit on February 15th of 2013 because I took the initiative and did my research. You need information.

I don't remember the books and websites but you need to know the psychological effects of smoking (drugs in general) in your equilibrium. It made me depressed with the disruption of dopamine and acetylcholine traffic and frequency. Quitting made a big difference. I could set for 5-10 hours onto a book or an activity without having the filter of "grey life" set in. Bottom line, every high makes your regular *life* low.

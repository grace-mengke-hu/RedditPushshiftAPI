Square One (rant)

I feel bad posting that but I need to tell you so I cannot lie to myself anymore, because I feel that this community is the only one who cares about me, no one else care about this, not even my SO can understand properly what I'm going through.

I failed, again, I bought a pack a smoked some, now I'm even more disgusted about myself, m throat hurts, the f**k is wrong with me ? The trigger might be because I feel powerless regarding some minor issues that I have and, you know, cigarettes are so familiar :(

My packet is lying on my desk, I won't take it back home

Addiction sucks.

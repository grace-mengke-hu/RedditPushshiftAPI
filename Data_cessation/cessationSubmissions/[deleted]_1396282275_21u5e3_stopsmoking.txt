One Week!

So, I made it an entire week! That's how long it takes for the body's physical dependence on nicotine to be eliminated, or so I read. So, that's a very positive note right there!

Also, I got blackout drunk on Saturday, and still didn't smoke! Drunk me is just as passionate about quitting as sober me, go figure!

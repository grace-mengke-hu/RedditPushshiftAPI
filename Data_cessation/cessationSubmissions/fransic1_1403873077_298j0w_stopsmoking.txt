2 months and feel alive again

We quit 2 months ago today , and we're feeling really proud at the moment. I just can't believe how good life can be without smoking , health wise and financially , we swim twice a week and are walking 10 miles a week . Anyone considering quitting should do it NOW ! The pros for quitting are immeasurable . The pros for smoking ....er ....well there are none. 

Just have to say there are some great posts in here , so many to relate to , so many of us going through this and making it.

One day at a time for us ðŸ˜ƒ

477 days and my hand tremor is gone. Has anyone else experienced this after quitting?

I realize this is something not a lot of people discuss but I am curious about others who have experienced this and whether or not quitting has helped them as well or if what I am experiencing is somewhat of an anomaly. I quit last year in February and before I quit I had a hand tremor that was growing more pronounced as I was getting older. It was terrifying because I did a lot of work with my hands... and now it's pretty much gone. In periods of high stress it has resurfaced but for the most part is gone any time I use my hands. Has anyone else encountered this after quitting or is it unrelated?

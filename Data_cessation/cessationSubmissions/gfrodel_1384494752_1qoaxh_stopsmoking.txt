2 Weeks: For The First Time Ever! (8 Years)

Holy Shit! You guys are the best. I never thought I could do it. I still remember standing in line on day three to buy a pack after a stressful day and thinking "You've made it this far. This could be the one chance" and leaving as I got to the counter. It's been easier than I thought. The cravings are there but managable. Drinking with friends at the bar is dangerous territory. Everyone in Seattle smokes. But even when I went out hard I resisted!

Thank you guys! You're all an Inspiration! Lets do this!

Today I quit.

I've been smoking for 3 years now, and it has to end. If I'm honest, I really did enjoy smoking, but that's over. It makes me feel bad for myself and it makes me feel like shit. 

I started a new diet in hopes of losing weight so I thought why not drop smoking too.

Wish me luck, and good luck to others!

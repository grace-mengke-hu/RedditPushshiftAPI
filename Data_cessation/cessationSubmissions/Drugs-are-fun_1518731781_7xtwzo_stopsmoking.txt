16 an a smoker, I'm quitting for sure

I'm 16 an had been smokin for 8-9 months, daily for 4-5 months, realised the harm it is causing and have managed to go 1 and a half weeks cold turkey. It's so hard, the main reason is whenever I get a craving n I resist I get a wave of depression which can be overpowering. I haven't smoked but it makes me feel so shit, I hope it stops soon.

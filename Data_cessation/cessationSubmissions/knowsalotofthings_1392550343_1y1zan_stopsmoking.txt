Here's the fucking deal.

I think the best gift that anyone can ever get is to wake up one day and have the courage to do something which they couldn't do before. Something like that happened to me today.

Today, I woke up and I realized that I was wasting my life away. I had my head too deep in my ass to see it through. Cigarettes made me feel good? Well, then why aren't all non-smokers miserable all the time? Cigarettes are a friend? Well, fuck that, friends don't cost money. Cigarettes were my masters and I was their slave. And I had to be free.

I don't want to die of cancer, I don't want to be tired all the time and I don't want to be unhealthy. I am just 18 for fuck's sake. And today, I realized, that for the last three years the worst thing that has happened to me wasn't that break up which drove me to almost depression or that accident which still scares me, it was that moment when I first picked up a cigarette. Fuck that moment, I was being a stupid kid, a really stupid kid.

I have made my decision, I am going to do it and keep to it. Fuck smoking. The only regret I have today is that I didn't realize it a few years ago, maybe then I could have been a different self today but it's never too late. I'm done with this, for sure. But with that being said, I know I am going to need support and after being here for a few days, I know where to look.

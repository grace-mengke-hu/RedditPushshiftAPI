Two weeks mark, very strange morning

Checking in: I've hit the two weeks mark today and the strangest thing happened this morning. I caught myself not thinking about smoking for hours, not even thinking about how I rocked because I quit. I just caught myself in the act and it felt so fucking good!

I'm NOT going to get complacent and I WILL stay vigilant; I know it's waiting, out there somewhere.

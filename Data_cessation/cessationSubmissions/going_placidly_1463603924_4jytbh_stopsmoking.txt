1 Month going on 3 days

A month just passed for me and went pretty much unnoticed as it feels like I'm still in the first week. Cigarettes are on my mind almost constantly. I guess the cravings have become less severe but fuck its in the forefront of my mind day and night. I imagine that because of my intense relationship with smoking I'm going to feel like this for some time still. Perhaps even years, I don't know. But I do know one thing, I never want to be a smoker again. I pray for the infatuation to end.

god help me

Basically I quit smoking a week ago using an ecig, it was going great until today when it broke. I'm wondering if it's even worth trying to quit as chances are I'm going to die alone anyway as im not really sociable anyway so the only person my death will affect is me. Is it worth it so I don't feel like shit anymore?

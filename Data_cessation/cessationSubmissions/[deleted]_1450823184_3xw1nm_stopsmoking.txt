It's Christmas ðŸŽ„

Yes not a puff not one...haven't entered anything in this diary for quite some time. not sure why.. but I've been doing good...I don't have to quit and get bad nerves for newyears because "I've been there, done that " 58 days ago... lol. on a brighter note...I went on a roadtrip to Toronto last weekend with my two sons for 3 days.. poor me...I forgot my luggage... and my patches...lol. well..I made it without a patch for the total time in Toronto. guess what? when I arrived home I put only one patch on instead of the usual 2, and it's been that way ever since 
Merry Christmas from Canada Everybody

I feel that this time that’s it

Here. I’ve just smoked my last cig.
I had lots of them over the years, but now I feel and know, that this was my last one. I feel that i can do it, 

I’ve got my hopes up that in no time, my muscle and lever wouldn’t hurt everytime i start my routine at the pool. 

I’m looking forward to having no issues with ladders, with my skin, with my tongue, 

I already can taste sweeter smell and palette of my cornflakes tomorrow morning. 

I can feel the strength coming back to me, as oxygen starts to find its way back into my tired blood cells.

My mind is almost scratching itself, understanding how much power it will get back, how much thoughts would not be clouded, how much time would be gained and health recovered.

I can’t wait to get up next morning. 

I can feel that change is not coming, but, what’s better, has already come.

I’m free. I’m healthier. I’m back.
Good luck to all of you, fellow non-smokers.

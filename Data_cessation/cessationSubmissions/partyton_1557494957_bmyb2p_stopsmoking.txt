3 weeks today

I hit 3 weeks clean today, had a rough day and bought a packet...  
I fucking hate these death sticks so much. I'm not angry, but very disappointed.  I tried to smoke one, but they taste awful now, thank goodness.   
Can't wait to never think about these again.  


What is everyone's go to distraction?

My Christmas message to this sub

Merry Christmas everybody, I hope you're all enjoying the holidays and staying smoke-free.

One year ago today, I quit smoking.  I lasted 39 days.  On day 40, hanging with my smoking buddy, I suddenly felt that I could handle one of his cigarettes.  So I did.  Within a few days, I was back to smoking full-blown.

So I smoked for 3 weeks.  Then quit again for 12 days.  On day 13, again with my buddy, I asked him for a smoke, thinking I could handle it.  He tried to talk me out of it, but I insisted.  And within a few days, I was smoking at all-out levels, and continued for 5 months.

But I quit again somewheres in August, and since then, I've had numerous temptations to smoke just one.  And everytime, I have to have a little talk with myself, saying that, "It's not just one... you will soon be smoking full-blown for months, maybe years"

The way I consider a single smoke, is like jumping out of the safety of a plane, over an ocean of cigarettes.  I won't hit the ocean that instant, but I soon will, and then be stuck in the ocean for months, years, maybe the rest of my life.

So please people, try to get the day done without a single puff, we are addicts, our brains are wired for nicotine, we can't handle any of it.

All the best!

Small Victories

I've been off for almost 2 months now and although I still have the urge to smoke it's the little victories that keep my ambition to quit fresh. 

When filling up my tank today I didn't buy a pack of Malby Golds like I'd done hundreds of times before. It felt good. 

Just felt like sharing what feels like a win. Here's hoping I don't relapse  again.

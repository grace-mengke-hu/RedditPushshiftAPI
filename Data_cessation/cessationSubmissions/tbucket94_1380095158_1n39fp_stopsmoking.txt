Hit bottom. Working my way back up. [Long post]

I've been putting off posting this for a while. But I know some of you may find yourselves in the same situation and I want to help people avoid it. 

So generally I am a moderately emotional person. But since I quit smoking just over 2 weeks ago, I have been extremely emotional. Crying, lashing out, the works.

And this past Saturday, I went to a party. I had had more than a few to drink and decided I wanted to go outside and sit with all the people I used to smoke with. I convinced myself that if I just have one cigarette at this party that I would be fine. But everyone I asked told me no because they all wanted me to stay a non smoker.

I ended up getting angry and storming off only to find myself in a crying fit inside. Ended up embarrassing myself in front of everyone at the party. I still have people texting me about it.

But now, whenever I have even the slightest craving for a cigarette, I remember back to that day. To what the craving turned me into. And I get so disgusted by what I became that the craving goes away immediately.

Bright side is: I haven't wanted a cigarette since Saturday. I just wish I didn't have to heal this way. It's a long road ahead of me. And this is just the beginning.

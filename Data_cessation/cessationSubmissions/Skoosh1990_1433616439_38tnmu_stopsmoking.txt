23 hours into the unknown

I can't stop grinding my teeth. My nieces (ages 2 and six) are here for a surprise visit. My head is killing me because of the grinding teeth. I keep repeating under my breath "each craving will pass with or without a cigarette " as well as various obscenities. The people who commented on my last post have become my personal hero's.

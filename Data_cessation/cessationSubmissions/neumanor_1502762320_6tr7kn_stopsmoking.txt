Hey everybody I need your help!

I'm 37. I've been smoking since I was 15. The past couple of years I have been chain smoking newports. I have a horrible smokers cough and hack up phlegm all of the time. I get out of breathe doing the simplest things. I need to quit. It's killing me. I'm going to go out and smoke my last cigarettes and quit cold turkey tomorrow. I've said this before......

tomorrow is the first day

Hi guys,
I am not sure why I searched and found this place - I guess it is nice to read successful stories of others that have stopped smoking, inspiring me that I could do it too. I have been smoking for more or less ten years and in the last years I felt more and more bad about it. the anxiety of waiting to be able to smoke again each day is having a bad effect on me. there is a lot that I want to change in my life, but getting rid of this addiction is one of my top priorities. I hate the feel when aching for another smoke, the fear of reeking of smoke around the workplace and the overall effect on my health and behavior. I want to live as a person uninhibited by smoking. tomorrow marks the first day in my journey of stopping the habit. it has been enough.

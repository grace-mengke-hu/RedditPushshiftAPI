First time going 4 days without a smoke in 8 years

I've had one other attempt about 3 years ago. I lasted 3 days.

Today is day four and I FEEL GOOD. I get cravings but.. they're manageable... And short... I am so shocked, because the last time I tried to quit I was INSANE. 

I'm scared that I'm just naive and it's going to hit me like a ton of a bricks soon, but either way, LONGEST TIME IN 8 YEARS and there's no stopping me. :)

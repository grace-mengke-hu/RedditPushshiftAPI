I only have one cigarette left...

So, I know "cold turkey" seems to be the thing to do, but I've been decreasing my cigarettes for the past week, and was down to 2 today, and have my last one set for tomorrow.  I'm a 21 year old female, and have only been smoking for about a year, and had been planning to quit right after graduation, but last week had a strange compelling urge to do this sooner rather than later.

I watched my grandfather die from emphysema, and my grandmother is on oxygen now because of smoking her whole life.  My mom's side of the family mostly smokes, and seeing my mom pick it up again recently for the first time in about 20 years really terrified me.  I figure, my grandparents are old, they're going to die anyway, but the thought of losing my mom at a too-young age from something as stupid as cigarettes just makes me angry and upset.  And I don't want to go down that road myself.  And, hearing my dad, who doesn't smoke, make concerned comments about how he wishes we would quit just makes me want to cry.

So, tomorrow, hopefully, I'm done.  Smoking seems, honestly, like a cool thing to do while I'm a college student, but it's not going to look so cool when I'm old and wrinkly and lightin up.  Or when I'm dead.

So here's to quitting...this post is mainly to motivate and keep me accountable if (when?) I think to myself that it couldn't hurt to go through one more pack before stopping for good.  Cause that's bullshit.  Done with this.

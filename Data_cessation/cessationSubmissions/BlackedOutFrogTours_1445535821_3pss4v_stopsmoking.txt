6 months!!!

6 months!!! I hit it a lil while ago, but happy to share the good news with you guys. 

-What's my perspective?
After 2 months... I stopped thinking about cigarettes entirely. I still chew gum on long road trips, but that's it. It's amazing that 6 months just snuck up on me, I used to track the hours of that first week painfully, and now I feel free. I feel so silly for smoking as long as I did because the uncomfortable part of smoking is so brief. If you can get past the withdrawals (which are seriously mild in hindsight), you will be so much better off quickly. After the first week of minor panic moments - Cravings for me felt like being dehydrated and a lil annoyed. 

-Is it worth it?
It's such a joy not having to make sure I get my nicotine fix before I start my day, or need to hide part of my life from people I love. It feels like living a more honest and care free life. I know it's good for health, but getting freedom from an addiction that would control my routines is totally worth it. Now I feel great all the time! 

-How I did it? 
Got food poisoning and got through 2 days without having to try too much. Allen Carr easy way helped me get through the 3 day hump and beyond. Cold turkey is the way to go. Got some mucinex and mucus loosener to get through the productive cough when my lungs were cleaning themselves. I still have half a pack in the house that I just chose not to smoke - bc not having cigarettes on hand used to be a stressful trigger.


- Tips and tricks?
Early days - carbonated zero cal and non caffeinated drinks with a straw were a great way to fill up and feel satiated. Gave a soothing sensation with the straw. Not drinking helped with willpower. Allen Carr easy way was crucial. Carrots and low cal Popsicles and lollipops when needed. Exercise too. Melatonin for sleep help. Apple Cider Vinegar supplements for a lil pep in the mornings and to help suppress appetite.  

-Special tool for making it to the end of this post? 
For a soothing feeling that I WISH I knew about when I was first quitting - try GABA supplements. Love the GABA chill. I can get really stressed and anxious and oh my god GABA is the best. 

TL;DR
Allen Carr easy way, once I got to 1.5/2 months i was in the clear. So awesome! Good luck and thank you r/stopsmoking

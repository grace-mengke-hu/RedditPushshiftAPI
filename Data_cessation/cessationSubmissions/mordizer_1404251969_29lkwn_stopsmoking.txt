623 Days....wow

For a while there I never thought I'd be able to do this but it looks like it's working :)

Still get the odd craving once in a blue moon but they're easy to squash if you acknowledge that there's never just one smoke.

Good luck to those still trying, it's unlikely that your willpower is as weak as mine so your chances are good that you'll win!

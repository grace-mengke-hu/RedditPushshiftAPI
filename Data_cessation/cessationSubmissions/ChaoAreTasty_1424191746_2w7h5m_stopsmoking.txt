Starting to quit

I've been saying for ages "I'll quit by 30". Well a few days ago was my 30th so it's time to make good on it. I haven't quite managed to stop yet but the past few days I've cut down heavily. Gone from 13-15 a day to 3-5 just taking the edge of the worst of the cravings. Not looking forward to going to 0 though.

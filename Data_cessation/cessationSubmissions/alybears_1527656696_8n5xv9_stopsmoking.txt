This is so weird

I’ve been smoke free for 18 days now using vaping lightly as a NRT and I haven’t had any serious cravings yet. However, all day today I’ve been thinking about the weirdest things like how I never did certain things while smoking. I was at work and I couldn’t stop thinking about how I never smoked while laying down or how I never smoked while taking a long road trip. It sounds strange but this is the only time I’ve craved a cigarette throughout this whole process and while I am very confident that I’m not going to smoke because of this I just can’t seem to shake the feeling that I’ve missed so many opportunities to enjoy smoking more than I did while I was smoking.
I’m sorry if this is hard to make sense of (I’m very tired) but I just wanted to get it out there and see if anyone had the same thoughts.

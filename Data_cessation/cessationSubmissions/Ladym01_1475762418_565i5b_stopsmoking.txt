A 20+ year smoker

My mother has been smoking for as long as I can remember and I am 30 years old. she is 57. im starting to worry and I want to know of some ways I can help her but I know she has to want the help for herself as well. ive been staying with her this past month because I am worried. lately ive been noticing that every single night she has this cough that may last for almost an hour. it wakes me up at night and scares me because its like she cant stop or control it. then her legs and hands are swollen. I swear I think she smokes 2 packs a day at least one or 2 an hour. she had to go to the doctors because she had a blood clot in both legs and the doctors told her she must stop smoking and she told them she wont. she has high blood pressure that she doesn't take her meds for and im sure a host of other issues. as a child begging for help for her mother what are some things I may be able to do to convince her that if she doesn't stop soon she will kill herself. my sister died from COPD. she smoked since she was 12 died at 28 so my mother is lucky. I just want to know what you guys do to stop

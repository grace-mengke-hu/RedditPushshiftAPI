Third time's a charm.

Hey everyone,

So this is my third serious attempt to quit. It's been 1 day so far and loving it. Even though I'm going through the slight cravings, I remember my story and I'm even more convinced that this is the best decision I've made in a while. 

I started smoking around 5 years ago, and succeeded to quit twice before; once through just willpower, the second time thanks to Allen Carr's Easyway to quit smoking. The second time was definitely the most effective. I was going strong for nine months until I went through a bad breakup and lit up to punish myself. Doesn't that sound idiotic? I felt so guilty about this relationship going south that my subconscious somehow convinced me that I had to punish myself. After that, it was all downhill. 

Now, I have listened to Allen Carr's book again, and realized where my mistake was; I can never, EVER, light up another cigarette again. I was doing great until I smoked that cigarette after nine months. I remember crying not just about the break-up, but also about knowing that I'd be back to smoking regularly after this one cigarette. 

This time was definitely harder to deprogram myself from all the excuses I had about quitting smoking. I just want to remind everyone that is far along into being free of nicotine: it just takes that one puff to bring you right back to where you started. Don't underestimate that one haul during a drunken party. It WILL bring you back to being a smoker. I learned the hard way, but now I know that even if I fuck up about something in my life, there's no reason to punish myself but to just deal with it. 

Thanks for reading and congrats to everyone in this sub. You're on your way to being free!

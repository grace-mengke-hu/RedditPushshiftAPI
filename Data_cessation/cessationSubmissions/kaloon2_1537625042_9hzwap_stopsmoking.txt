Little Victories and Big Changes

Yesterday I got some really great news that left me feeling super amped up; normally when I would be feeling excited I would meet up for drinks with close friends and tell them all about my news...which usually lead to smoking like half a pack. And then I’d spend the rest of the day/night feeling like I’d destroyed the excitement since I’d feel so low on energy after.

Yesterday, however, I got in the car feeling like I should call my friend to meet up, but I decided to go to the gym first instead. I burned off all the over-excited energy and in the process got rid of my classic craving for a celebratory cigarette. I felt so good the rest of the day and was able to enjoy my good news full of energy.

It’s moments like that where I feel like this difficult process of quitting is totally worth it.

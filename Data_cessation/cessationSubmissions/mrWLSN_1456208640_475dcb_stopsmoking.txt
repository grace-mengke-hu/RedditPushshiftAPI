Today marks 365 days... one full year.

Today marks one full year without a single cigarette. I'm deleting my tracker app - no longer need it. Going cold turkey was originally hard but worth it. After the original addiction was gone, there were no secondary addictions that I feared might be the case if I turned to vaping (is vaping considered quitting?), gum or patches. My new addiction is the gym and bettering myself physically.

I had 'tried' quitting before, lasted a month here or there, but always coming back because I found I had people telling me I should quit, but I wasn't telling me I should quit. To successfully quit I found, I needed to want it and KNOW I wanted it. I started to despise my smoking lifestyle, the way I felt during and mostly after a cigarette and the money I spent on it (in Australia it just keeps going up and up). I wanted a healthier, happier life and I've now got it. 

It's worth it. 

EDIT: Clarity that I'm not deleting my prized reddit app, but instead my smoke-free tracking app.

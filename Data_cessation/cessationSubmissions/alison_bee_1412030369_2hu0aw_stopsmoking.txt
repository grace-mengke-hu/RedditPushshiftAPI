tomorrow is my last day...hopefully

so tomorrow *has* to be my last day of smoking. I'm having surgery at the end of the month, and my doctor won't do it unless I'm tobacco-free for 28 days. 

I'm a 25 year old female - I've been a half-pack a day smoker for about 6 years now, and love smoking. it's my excuse to get away from people if I need a break, it helps me calm down when I'm stressed, and generally makes me feel fantastic when I'm otherwise feeling shitty. 

I'm worried that I'm going to lose my mind over the next few weeks. I don't have any alternatives set up, mainly because I've been procrastinating quitting for a long as possible. tips for keeping my sanity would be greatly appreciated!

11 days without the evil

Hi everyone, sorry for my bad english, I'm matteo, a 26 years old  italian guy with a big problem with smoke.
Short story, I had 4 pneumotorax in 4 different years and I smoked for at least 10 years. I know the pneumotorax isn't caused by smoke, but anyway if you smoke of course your lungs are not so "strong and healty". I remember myself with a pipe in my pleura and a cigarette in my hand. 
The last pneumotorax was very bad, it required a particular surgery because my lung didn't want to "repair" itself and the doctors found a small black part in my lungs, like 2x2cm, they cut it and now I'm ok... but anyway after the surgery i stopped smoking for like 1 month... and then again... I used to smoke also a lot of weed, but here in italy often is very expansive and shitty quality so of course you need tobacco with it, not a good thing. I used to smoke 2 spliff a day and AT LEAST 20 red lucky strike. 
I've taken the big decision, I'm using an e-cig but i'm off the cigarettes from 11 days, it's very difficult, but i can breathe better, i've really started to hate the cigarette smoke, taste, smell, everything... I feel that this time is different, i'm really commit to stop smoking, I just don't want to be anymore a slave of the big tobacco company... and save my life... 
I smoked just one cigarette 3 days ago... i can resist cravings very well during the day, but alchool is my big problem, here in italy everyone smoke.. and with a simple beer in a pub it becomes very difficult to be strong. But I know I can do it, for my family, my friends, my girlfriend.. for myself.

Need advice: managing mornings

I quit every night, it seems. I set my app and feel determined and dedicated. Then, the morning comes and I am right back to it. I can 'quit' during the day after the morning smoke, stay quit all day and night, but goshdarn the next morning. SO smokes so the cigs are around.

I am so tired of this.

Have advice? Thank you!

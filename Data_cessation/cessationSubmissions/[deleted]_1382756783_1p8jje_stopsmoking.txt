Day 3 down. Here is my story

I started smoking in High School and smoked until I was 23. I quit when I was in the Army and was given zyban and patches. I was a pack a day regular smoker and an extra pack if I was drinking. Zyban and the patch worked relatively well for me aside from mild side effects from the zyban(wellbutrin). I ended up marrying a smoker and had no urge to smoke aside from a puff when I was wasted or a cigar on special occasion. Didn't smoke for ~9 years.

Fast forward to me being a dumbass about a year ago. Hanging out with old high school buddies for bachelor party. I get a pack and smoke most of them and leave the 6 or 7 remaining cigarettes in the pack. I would grab one after a stressful day at work or whatever. Then I would bum them from my wife whenever I had a few drinks. I recently lost an uncle to lung cancer, and tried to quit after his funeral(made it 2 or 3 days). I have been at half a pack recently. I am not known to smoke at work, so I stay away from the smoke hut outside but light up as soon as I leave the parking lot.

Well fuck it, I'm done. I bought some patches the other night and stuck one on Wednesday morning. I get urges at work but they go away. driving is rough. I can't go into gas stations. Wife still smokes in the garage. I stay away, but had crazy urges earlier and looked for a smoke. Thank god that I didn't find one. 

Tips:

Don't buy a pack. Ever

Make bumming a smoke a personal no-no.

Stay away from places that tempt you.

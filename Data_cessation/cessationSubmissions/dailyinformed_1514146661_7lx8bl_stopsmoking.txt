Day 14. Feeling tired, sleepy unmotivated all of sudden?

I know it's a chemical imbalance for sure. How do I know? 
I felt like this yesterday until...Let's just say I took an extremely small dose my favorite sweet drink and I had a sudden surge of "feel good" "life is perfect" type of relief and I felt like myself(but this feeling evaporated pretty quickly).

Does anyone have experience feeling a sudden bang of tiredness or just "not wired" around day 13-14?  I thought this was something that usually is normal early on(I probably didn't notice it as much for some weird reason but I'm suddenly really feeling it now).

Any thoughts?


ALSO:  I can't explain it but I can't stay asleep. I fall asleep but then I wake up every hour or so then go back to sleep and I wake up feeling weird.

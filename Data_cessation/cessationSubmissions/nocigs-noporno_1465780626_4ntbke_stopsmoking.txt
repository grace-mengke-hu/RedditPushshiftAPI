This is what i did if i feel like im going to fail.

I smoke an herbal cig.  Now i know it smoking but i wont become addicted to it.   Its like a fake out.  Instead of smoking a tobacco cig.  If i did that i would be back to puffing away 20 cigs a day.  No nicotine but soon i wont even smoke them bc they dont do anything.  like i said its like a mental fake out.  No addictive substances so i cant become addicted.  I do this only on ether really stressed out days or occasion.  Also if u haven't read allen cars book easy way to stop smoking.

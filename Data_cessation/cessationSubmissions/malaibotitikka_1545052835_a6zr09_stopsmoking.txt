How do I stop smoking when all my friends are heavy smokers? (removed from r/relationships)

Throwaway because my friends actively use reddit as well

&amp;#x200B;

I am a Muslim girl and joined university at the age of 21. A bit late for my age. Due to that, I had trouble making many friends. Still, I met a nice crowd of girls and guys. They liked me and I liked them. Thus our friendship started.

&amp;#x200B;

Now all my friends are heavy smokers. Cigarettes, sheesha, weed, you name it. They simply can't meet without smoking.

I used to hang out with them almost daily. But in only 3 months, the habit has taken a toll on me. I failed a few quizzes, my lips and fingers got burnt and I went terribly broke. I decided to stop smoking but they beg me to come along. When I tell them my parents would be mad at me for coming home late, they tell me to lie to parents. When I say I've burnt my lips, they offer me lipstick to cover it up (I only use baby powder and tinted lip balm for uni). When I say I'm going broke, they offer to pay. When I mention I'm failing, they say "lol same"

I actually do like these people and wish there was someway I could be friends with them without the smoking and lying part. My friends are loaded with money and their parents don't care about their activities. My parents can't pay me pocket money and took loans to put me in university. I can't let them down. What should I do?

**TLDR: Friends are heavy smokers. I can't keep up with their habits. How do I stay friends with them without giving in?**

Breaking up with nicotine

This is so emotional for me. (Pls excuse me)

December 7, 2017 is the day i'm going to break up with the longest relationship i've ever had - with nicotine and ciggarettes.

All started when my tongue turned blue from the lack of oxygen i had from smoking. Anyway, i really need some support, this is so hard for me. I'm actually in tears rn typing this. 

I started smoking when i was 16, (i'm 22 now) and cigarettes have been with me through from my ups and my downs. Especially during great parties, good conversations. But most especially during heartbreaks, bad days, days wherein i would evebt dare to mention here. Cigarettes were there. Everyone seemed to leave except for them. It was so easy to get them, so cheap. Yet little did i know, this was going to be the most toxic relationship in my young life. 

Cigarettes were there when i flunked, my boyfriends left me, humiliated, when i felt the whole world was against me. Cigarettes were there. But slowly, they're killing me; slowly deteriorating my insides in every puff, every light. Cigarettes also kept me in shape mind you. Made me lose my appetitie and control my diet. (I also smoked before gymming and after LOL) 

But after 7 years with you. Just really, just time to say goodbye. I'm graduating college soon and yes, you've been with me the whole journey. Just like a toxic relationship, you dont even know youre in one. So good bye.

Please guys i really need your support. I really, really want to just stop. :(

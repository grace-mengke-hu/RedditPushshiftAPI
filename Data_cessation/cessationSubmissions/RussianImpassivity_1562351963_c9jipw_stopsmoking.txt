I’m now past 4,5 months mark

Wow does time fly fast. I can’t believe I actually made it after trying to quit snusing (Swedish dip) and smoking the past 6 years now. 


To those who just quit and are now browsing this, trust me, it gets easier.  A lot easier.  First week is no biggie for me, it’s the second week, and the third week which is the worst. When the depression kicks in and you just hate everyone. 

When you’ve succeeded in finishing those 3 first weeks, then it’s smooth(er) sailing from now on

Day one, quitting with my fiancee

I had quit for almost three years then gradually started again when my fiancee and I got together (she was "quitting," I ended up starting back up instead)

The last time we tried to quit together in August, we had a truly horrible fight on day 3 and immediately bought a pack to recover. Any tips for couples trying to quit together?

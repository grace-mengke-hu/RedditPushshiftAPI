8 weeks in and feeling like shit.

I'm 8 weeks in to quitting cold turkey. I'm 30 years old and had been a smoker for about 15 years. At first I had really bad withdrawals, chest pains, migraines, etc. but it seemed like they were slowly getting better. I felt almost completely normal for about a week and then suddenly everything kicked in again. Along with the initial symptoms I now have been getting really bad anxiety. I get chest pains simply from taking a short walk and have had daily migraines and nausea. I never went through a coughing phase and still don't have a smokers cough. I do force myself to cough daily though and it is usually speckled with gray spots and occasionally bloody. 

Is this normal activity and should I just wait it out? I haven't had any actual cravings to smoke, but I never experienced any of these problems while I was a smoker. Any tips or advice would be awesome, Thanks.

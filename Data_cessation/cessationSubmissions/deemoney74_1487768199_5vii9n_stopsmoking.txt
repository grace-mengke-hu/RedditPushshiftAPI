Is keeping track of the time a good thing?

Just curious?  I was wondering if it's such a good idea for us to keep track of how many days/hours it's been.  I know that they are important milestones in our individual cessations  but at some point shouldn't we just be like, "I don't smoke."  And not even remember how long it's been?  And not care when our last puff was?  Would love to hear some input here.

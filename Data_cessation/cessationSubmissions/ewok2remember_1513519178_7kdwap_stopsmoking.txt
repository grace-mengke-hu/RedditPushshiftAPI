I need help

I have five cigarettes left. After they're gone, I want to be done. I've tried this before, but I always fail. Those of you who have quit or are quitting, do you have any advice? I also want to avoid the pitfalls like overeating, as those are just as bad for my bank account and still harmful to my overall health.

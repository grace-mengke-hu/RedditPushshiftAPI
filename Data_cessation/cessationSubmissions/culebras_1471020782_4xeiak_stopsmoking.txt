Starting my second week, brimming with confidence

I am so thankful to my wife, who never pressured me into this but was an immense support when i stopped cold turkey.
I am so thankful to my new employer, who allows for a healthy work atmosphere in which a cranky ex-smoker can kick his habit.
I am so thankful to you all for countless reads that reassured me at ever craving that appeared.

I already felt on day 4 like Tim Robbins popping out of the sewer in Shawshank Redemption, but i kind of expected the following days to test me. 
I don't know if they actually did, because it has been a breeze, and being it the 7 or 10th attempt for a 35 year old, i cannot begin to explain how good i feel right now: My anxieties are gone, i can cope with work not going as planned much better, my car is not filthy with smoke smell and ashes, i can ~~walk~~ RUN, i can... is there a character limit for reddit posts?

My only fear is that some day i won't remember how much i wanted this, because 2 weeks ago i thought i would die young and now i am annoyingly happy.

Wish you guys a lovely weekend, i'm going to savour the most expensive dish i find on the menu tonight!

Long time quitters... Do you ever feel like a non smoker instead of an ex smoker?

I used to smoke a pack a day, but in the last few years it's only been on and off, mainly on nights out but maybe up to five a day some days.

Regardless of that fact, I am done :) I want to be smoke free for the rest of my days (day 5 in case you're wondering!)

I'm just curious.... Do you eventually consider yourself a non smoker with nothing to do with cigarettes, or are you always an ex-smoker, even if you know you'll never touch them again?

Thanks!

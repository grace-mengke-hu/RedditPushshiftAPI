Smoking marijuana

I haven't seen anything on this sub re: quitting cigarettes and continuing to smoke weed, so I'm curious.

I used to smoke weed a lot more than I do now (I take a couple of hits every couple of weeks now). When I did smoke weed more, I'd often take a few hits, and then light up a cigarette which "enhanced" the high.

Part of me would like to continue smoking weed occasionally, but I'm worried about the actual act of smoking something triggering a relapse. Does anyone have any experience with this? I'm talking about smoking strictly weed, not weed+tobacco in a spliff or something.

I finally feel strong enough

I'm 18, have been smoking since I was 14. I always used cigarettes as a break from all that was going on while I was going through severe depression. Just a little 10mins to myself away from all the chaos. But I finaly feel good enough in my own mind to stop it. This pack is my last pack and I'm sure of it.

I'm on day 199 and (still) struggling. Help?

They title pretty much sums up my question. I stopped smoking cigarettes November 1st last year. 
But I still miss it. And for the next 6 months i'm abroad for an internship, I dont know anyone here so I'm scared of the possibility that the urge will grow. 
What I miss is the feeling of the first toke filling my lungs, but also just smoking itself. Sitting outside, listening to music, stopping the world for a few minutes. It also used to give me confidence. 
In my head I am on a (long) smoke break, my mind doesn't think that I stopped completely.

Any idea how to get rid of that once and for all?

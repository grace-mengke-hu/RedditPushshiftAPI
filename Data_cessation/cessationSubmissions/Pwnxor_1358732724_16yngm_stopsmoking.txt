My 14 step quitting plan.  So far, it's working well.


1.    Begin smoking sometime in the past.  Become a smoking master.
2.    Decide to stop smoking.
3.    Buy a box of nicotine patches.
4.    Put on a patch in the morning.
5.    Remove patch as soon as work ends.  Resume smoking.
6.    Repeat several times.
7.    Leave patch on until late evening, remove, resume smoking.
8.    Repeat several times.
9.    Manage to not remove patch, go to sleep.
10.  Repeat 3 times.
11.  Forget to put on a patch in the morning.
12.  Forget forgetting to put on a patch.
13.  Late evening, discover no patch was worn.
14.  Repeat for 2 days.

That's where I'm at ATM.  Still working on the list, will update if successful.  

/Urge to kill not as bad as expected, actually.

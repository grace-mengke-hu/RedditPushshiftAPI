I threw my cigarettes in the dumpster in the alley on Friday night

Then on Saturday morning I crawled head first into the garbage to fish them out. I smoked a few on Saturday then threw the pack in a public garbage can at an eye clinic a few blocks from my apartment.  You guessed, went back today and fished them out of that trash can too.  Need a badge reset.

New record!

I stopped smoking successfully before, for one month. Now that I'm passing that number, I'm feeling more anxious. I've been visiting this subreddit frequently just to read other's experience. So far, I'm glad to have a place where I can vent and know that cigarettes won't help. Still practicing on managing stress atm. Thanks for the support too.

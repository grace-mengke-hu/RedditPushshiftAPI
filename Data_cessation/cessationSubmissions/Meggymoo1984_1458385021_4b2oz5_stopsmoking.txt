Cravings a month in

After a month in,  I am starting to get the dreadful little nicotine monster saying "go on,  just have one puff, you've done so well,  it won't hurt. " I am reminding myself that there is no reason to have a pull and a number of good reasons not to. The nicotine monster is just trying to pull me into his liar. Last night I had an oopsy moment and the monster is trying to tell me that I might as well just through in the towel and start again.I am reminding myself that this was just a bump in the road. The voice of defeatism is the nicotine monster trying to take control againn

Two week milestone gone, but location abruptly changed. Profoundly struggling.

Hey guys. r/stopsmoking has been invaluable in helping me stay quit for over two weeks.

However-- those two weeks 'happened' to be when I left my place of study (the north of England) to return home to a place MUCH more smoking friendly, especially verbutten-smoking-friendly. 

Just a few hours ago, I returned to the UK, full of confidence that my relatively easy two weeks of quitting would see me through. Instead, I've been slammed in the face by triggers at every step. I'm astonished I haven't broken yet. How can something as physical as a headache be governed by psychological factors like this? The fuck?

Has anyone been through this kind of trouble? I'm seriously teetering on the edge, and hating myself for it. For reference, I've been a 10-15/day smoker for about six years. I thought I had this. Oh man.

ninja edit-- someone very kind well inevitably link to Allen Carr. I love the man and his book, both of whom made my smokeless two weeks possible!

Attempt 2.0

I have decided that the time has come yet again to attempt to free myself of this horrible habit and this morning I have extinguished my last cigarette. After a failed (and pretty badly misjudged) spell a few months ago, during which I lasted 17 days before succumbing once again, I feel in a better place to succeed this time.  

I need to put into practice the things I learned from the first time; I'll be steering clear of alcohol. The idea of giving up 2 vices at once is a scary prospect. Any advice to help me get through this?

Hey! Today is day 10 already, time flies so fast...

I still can't believe I managed to do it and I feel soooo relieved that I finally quitted smoking.

To be honest this was way more easier that I could ever imagine, implying that you're in the right state of mind. I only had 1 hard craving on day 3 but other than that, all the cravings lasted for less than a minute or so and were really easy to handle...

Now everyone still lurking and thinking "This is too hard for me" for whatever reason, you're all wrong. I felt condemned to smoke for the rest of my life, for me the addiction was too strong. But hey I just gave it a try, read a lot of ressources online, took 3 days off mostly laying in bed and once my body was nicotine free, well I could hang around smoker for all day long without feeling any need to take a puff.

Day 1 is gonna be ok, day 2 is gonna be a bit hard and day 3 is the worst. But once you reach day 4 man it's a child's game, craving just come to you for less than 5 minutes, you just tell yourself "hey, I did the hardest part, I just don't wanna smoke anymore why am I putting myself through this???" and it's over...

Just do it my friends, this is so worth, i've never felt that good in my entire life. Now I can go for a run, enjoy life, food, music and movies. This is like a reborn.

Good luck on you all and thank you.

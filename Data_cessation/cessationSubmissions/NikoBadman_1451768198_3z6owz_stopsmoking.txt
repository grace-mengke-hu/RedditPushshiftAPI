Seeking Allen Carr video

There was once posted an Allen Carr video on this sub, that made me a non smoker after watching it, and now i want a loved one to watch it, but the youtube link is dead. It was a video with pretty bad actors showing situations where you might want to light up a cigarette and what caused these cravings etc. Also 'the little nicotine monster' in your stomach was visualized as a cartoon. 

It looked like something from the early 80's, and as silly as it seemed with all the bad acting and the childish monster cartoon, it's message had a real strong impact on me. It wasn't Allen Carr himself presenting the video by the way.

Does anyone know what video i am talking about, and do yo have a link to it? Or can you upload it or send it as a PM if it' on your computer?

Edit: Just saw my 361 days mark. Holy cow.

Edit 2: Heres the dead link if any of you nerds can use it to track it down :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1OkzuMqliA&index=115&list=PL_Oe4cHGpavNZK3icPVQjoXCjfdXD9DAS

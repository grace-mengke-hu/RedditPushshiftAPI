Stopping nicotine soon!

I know you guys are talking about cigarette but i'm a vaper, but please hear me out. I'm quitting vape because it's wasted money. And i have to quit nicotine. Right now i vape some 1.5 mg of nicotine (which is very low, basically the lowest you can have in vape).

 I'm very scared of the withdrawals because some smokers said they faced depression because of those withdrawals. But you know i'm not an heavy smoker, i don't have the same amount of nicotine in my blood than an heavy smoker.

My question here is, do you think my withdrawals symptom will go away in 3-4 days? Some people on google says that the withdrawals take between 1-3 MONTHS and that is alot and that scares me.

Thanks guys.

Help, Why can't I stop?

I want to stop, but I'm so stressed out and I constantly go to cigarettes. I keep saying I won't buy another pack, then I get stressed or fidgety-bored and go and get another pack. I can't afford to smoke, I want to get fit again, and the girl I'm seeing hates it. 

I've smoked "full time" for just over two years now. It started socially, and I could handle that, but then I started a job I hate, which involves a lot of driving, and to 'pass the time' I smoke between clients. 

What do I do?  I've tried vaping, I'm currently trying gum, which at the start helped to cut down, but now I feel like it's not doing anything and I'm back to smoking again.

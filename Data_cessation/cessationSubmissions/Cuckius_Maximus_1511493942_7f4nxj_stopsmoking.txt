Day one tomorrow

Had my last cigarette out of my last pack, got a new tank for my old vaporizer thats been broken for a year. Last time I tried to cut back on smoking with a vaporizer amd eventually quit but I realize that was an awful plan and I was basically setting myself up for failure.


This time I'm going strictly no cigarettes at all, then I'll slowly dilute my 3mg ejuice to 0mg after a few weeks smoke free.

Quitting smoking round 3 wish me luck.

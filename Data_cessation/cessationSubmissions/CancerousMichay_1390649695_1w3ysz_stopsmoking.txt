I need help. I need advice. I need a kick in the ass.

I've been smoking for 6 years. 6 fucking years. I don't want to quit, not even a little, but I know that I need to. But I'm afraid of becoming a different person. 

I started when I was only 12, because I hung out with some not so great people. Smoking is my identity, it's who I am. I quit 3 different times, once was because of an ex and it lasted 9 months. In those months I became a totally different person. I was a bitch, I was overly emotional, I was irritated and stressed, but I was also 14 and in an abusive relationship which may have also been the reason for my drastic change. 

I've smoked the entire time that I've really grown as a person, and I feel like it's a huge part of who I am, I don't even know who I am without nicotine. I had it with me through puberty, I feel like it's encoded in my DNA. I'm afraid I will become that girl again once I quit, that I'll be weak, that I'll become a bitch.

I'm making some huge changes in my life, and I figured that maybe I could finally leave smoking behind. I want to do it for my future, I want to do it for my boyfriend, but I enjoy smoking so much. It's been there for me throughout my life, it's been the only real constant I've had. It's helped me through so many things, much more than anyone has. 

I do not want to quit, though. I know that I need to before it takes some huge tolls on me, if it hasn't already. I'm sorry for the rant, but I really need help. Stories, advice, reassurance, I just really need someone to help me finally kick this terrible, life sucking thing, to the curb. 

TL:DR: I really don't want to be a bitch, please help me.

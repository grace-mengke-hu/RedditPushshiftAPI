The morning after heavy drinking is a game changer without cigarettes.

I am used to enduring the worst hangovers after drinking, I don't have to be hammered either to get that hang over. But I deal with it by watching TV and not getting up from my bed. Every now and then there is someone who wants to celebrate something with a night of drinking and being out; I try to shy away from it during the weekdays because I don't want to be miserable at work. So last night I drank quite a bit and got normal drunk, fell asleep writing an email saying I wasn't feeling well and won't be into work. Usually my morning after drinking that same amount would leave me bed ridden until mid afternoon. I'm happy I didn't send it because I just bounced right up this morning without the slightest trace of a hang over. I did a little googling and cigarettes make your hangover significantly worse. Party on people!

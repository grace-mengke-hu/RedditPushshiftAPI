Pride after 41 days with no nicotine replacement!

Today, somebody outside the building where I work needed a lighter. He asked me if i smoked and I proudly said “no”.

I felt a real feeling of pride when I said this and it really sunk in that I am now a non-smoker. 

Good luck people trying to quit, try to remember that the cravings don’t last forever and they will pass despite what your brain tells you!

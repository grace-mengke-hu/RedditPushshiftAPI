Conflicted

I’ve just hit two weeks smoke free, and on the one hand I feel good. I look better, my anxiety has disappeared for the most part, and I’m more confident in myself in general. 

On the other hand I feel sluggish, disgusting and bloated 24/7 and it’s driving me insane. I exercise, have an active job and eat healthily, so it’s really pissing me off today that my body is doing this to me. Anyone else struggling with this?

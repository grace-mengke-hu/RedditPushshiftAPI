10 days and going strong!

I was a smoker (in denial, somewhat closet) for a number of years. Started out strictly social, as all my friends smoked. It got worse and I knew I lost control awhile ago. 

It was what I hated about myself the most. Constantly figuring out when my next smoke would be, when I could sneak out to have a cig, worrying about smelling like an ashtray in front of the wrong people. It was so embarrassing. 

I've always wanted to quit but always kind of convinced myself that I wasn't addicted and just a few cigs here and there weren't that bad. 

I quit because it was the sole thing that held me back all these years, and as I said before, truly the thing I hated about myself the most. I don't want to worry about the health effects, and the shame any longer. I quit because I want my life back. The cravings are hard and the dreams are wild, but nothing is better then freedom from this addiction.

I wish you all luck going through it as well! HOLD STRONG! Each day i get to wake up and add a tally to the calendar - it's amazing!

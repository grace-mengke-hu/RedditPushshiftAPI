A beginning

Hi, new to r/stopsmoking. Yesterday I had a conversation with my father, a smoker of forty years, in which he asked me to quit. He showed me the nicotine patch on his shoulder, and told me it had been four days since he last smoked. He told me that he knew how hard it was, I showed him the record I keep in an effort to moderate of days that I've indulged and days I haven't. I then asked him to please stay healthy, as I wanted him around, he in turn demanded the same of me. 
So here I am, I said my last goodbyes to nicotine a few hours ago, I've washed myself of the past, but I don't quite see how this is feasible or practical. I feel like I'm kind of wandering into the dark, so any advice you guys could provide would be appreciated a great deal. Just some starting tips or experiences that would aid in enlightening me as to what journey I've embarked on.

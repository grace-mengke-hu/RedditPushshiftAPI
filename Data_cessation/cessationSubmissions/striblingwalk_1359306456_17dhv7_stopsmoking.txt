Two months today! 

I'm a 27 year old male, and smoked a few packs a week, growing to a pack a day, for 10 years. I quit for the year 2010, but started again in early 2011.

Successfully quitting is helped by: 

1) [NoFap](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap) : It may sound strange, but NoFap has helped me focus on self-improvement. It's preserved energy and focus, and helped me keep "momentum" in quitting tobacco. 

2) I used nicorette lozenges in the first week or so. I use one every other day or so now. 

3) My counter on this subreddit, and reading the posts by this community. Thank you! 

I started reading Easyway, but haven't gotten very far yet. 

Remember: NOPE (Not One Puff Ever)! It's not so hard at two months as it was at two days, or two weeks. ***Keep at it!***

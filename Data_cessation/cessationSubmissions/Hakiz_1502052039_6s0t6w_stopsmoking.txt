Toughts about nicotine gum

So, this weekend I'll be going to Barcelona with my dad and some others, but I've not made it offical to him (though he probably knows) that I'm a light smoker (about 5 cigs a day). So I thought this might be a good opportunity to stop.

So I've tried nicotine gums, they significantly reduce the cravings for smoking. So I'm glad that's working.
The next step is obviously stop using nicotine gums, and what I wonder is if it's a viable strategy to gradually chew less and less nicotine gums while at the same time gradually increasing normal chewing gums?   

Edit: Please don't be overly supportive like "I know you will make it, you're stronger than you think!".
It's not so much that I dislike it, what it comes down to is that all my greatest achievements has come from moments when what I'm trying to do is either kept secret, or people telling me that I won't make it.

10 days!!!!!

It has been a long time since I have made it past 1 week.  Thanks to all here.  Your support as been so helpful in helping me make this stick.  When I feel like having a smoke I come here and read about those who are struggling and those who have overcome.  I really think that I would not have made it this far wihtout this sub.  My iwfe and friends are great support, but they don't know what it's like to be addicted to this shit.  Physically I feel better than I have in a long time.  The craves are still coming, but they are cued by old things that casue them - situations, things, thoughts - so I am learning to control those as well with all of your help.  

Thank you all and stay strong!

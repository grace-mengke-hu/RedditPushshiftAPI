Oximeter might help you quit.

Have quit several times after smoking over 40 years. Lasted 3 weeks about a year ago after getting pneumonia.  This time it's for good.  
  Spent a day in the ER last week from being short of breath, my blood pressure went up over 200/120 for some reason. It was and is again around 135/90.  
      Was on O2 and a nebulizer in the ER, my  SPO2% was down to 90% (oxygen reading at fingertip).
 Nonsmokers should be at 98 or 99, mine has been around 95 for the past few years. (I'm 67).
  
  From a respiratory therapy website: 
     " SpO2: It's a measure of how saturated hemoglobin are with oxygen.
    Normal: 95-98%
    Accepetable: 90% or better, and sometimes 88% or better with some disease conditions.
    CMS will not pay for oxygen unless the SpO2 is 88% or lower on room air at rest.
Be aware that a personâ€™s normal SpO2 decreases with age, while sleeping, and with some 
disease processes. The only way it can get to 100% is with supplemental oxygen.  "  


  I had been told by a doctor previously that when your spo2 is at 92%, you should be on oxygen.  (carry around a bottle--who wants to do that?).

   Bought a fingertip oximeter on Amazon for around  $20, it shows your spo2 and pulse.  2 AAA batteries.

 I would  highly recommend buying one.  You may be able to see how much smoking is hurting your breathing.   Damage is irreversible,
 if you are at 94 or 95 you will feel short  of breath when doing moderate work or exercise.  Tightness in the chest, wheezing, etc.  Even if you quit,  your SPO2  won't  improve.

 Quitting will at least stop or slow down the damage and hopefully keep your spo2 at what it currently is.

  For what it's worth..

Good luck.

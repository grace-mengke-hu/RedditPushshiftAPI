1 year!!!

One year today.  Wow.  Didn't think I would ever get here.  

I'm free!  (And 20 lbs lighter, and running three times a week, and not coughing all the time, and not stinky smelly gross, and most of all, not having to hide my embarrassing habit from everyone close to me.  So grateful.)

Everyone out there, hang in for the long haul.  It is so so worth it.

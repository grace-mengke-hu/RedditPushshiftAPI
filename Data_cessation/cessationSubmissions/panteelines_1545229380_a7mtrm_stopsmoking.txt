From smoking to vaping

I have a plan in place for the New Year.  I quit drinking a week ago, and switched from smoking to vaping, which I plan to do until the New Year, and then will quit that as well.  It's harder than I thought it would be.  I was always of the mindset that nicotine is nicotine, and vaping- in addition to other NR methods- would be an equal exchange, but it's not.  I always thought it would just be better to go cold turkey (which I've done unsuccessfully many, *many* times).  I'm vaping a Juul, which has a high nicotine content, so it seems I shouldn't want to smoke at all, but I do.  I have to fight constantly not to go and buy a pack of smokes.  

Smoking cigs hurts my lungs really bad, and always has.  My lungs get tight and close up, and I've caught myself stop breathing in my sleep.  Vaping is a little better, but not a lot- it still hurts my lungs, but not as dramatically as regular smoke.  It's definitely not something I want to do long-term.

But my point of this post is I take back my negative view of vaping and NR.  I see that there is a lot more habit breaking needed in my brain than simply cutting off nicotine.  I feel like vaping is allowing my body to detox all the garbage that comes from regular cigarettes, and that when it comes time to stop vaping, it won't be as dramatic.  That's my hope, anyway.  I'd love to hear from anyone who has used vaping to successfully quit smoking.  Thanks for listening.

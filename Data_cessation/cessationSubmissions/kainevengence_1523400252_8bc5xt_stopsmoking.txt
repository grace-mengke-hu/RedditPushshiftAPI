I cant quit smoking...

I seriously cant.

I get suicidally depressed as I already have severe untreated mental health issues that I cant get any help for. 

Smoking for me isnt physical dependency. Its straight up addiction. Selling my stuff for cigarettes. Unrolling and rerolling my butts when I have no money (often). Lashing out and burning bridges in relationships.

This shit completely controls my life in a real bad way and I cant stop it.

I got down to 1 smoke a day for 6 months a year ago thanks to a bout of psychosis that had me believing I was on the verge of a heart attack every time I lit up. Until my dad died from suicide. Then I was back to a pack a day over night.

Ive tried vaping 3mg nicotine but theres so little information on how much or how many puffs I should actually be taking. Im paranoid about ODing on nicotine from it.

I have unsuccessfully done patches and gums 4 times.

I can go for a week without smoking and Ill basically just be laying in bed, suicidally depressed, enraged hating the world. Shaking. Sweating. Muscle tension.

If anyone had told me that Id feel like a heroin addict and what thar actually looked and felt like, from cigarettes, Id probably have never started smoking.

I thought that people juat got a little iratable when they didnt have smokes. Not that I would go completely psychotic.

Im considering trying Champix but as far as I know its an anti depressant essentially... and Ive never done well with anti depressants and side effects and Im worried about taking that too.

What else can I take or do? 

There has got to be something. My life is so chaotic and my mental health state is so bad and its never going to get better because theres no help, that I am never going to be able to quit because of it...

Torn. I've really been wanting to quit

I have smoked for 12 years. Now my boys(4 and 6) have really been to notice. I want to quit but part of me likes being addicted. Nothing to worry about except my next cig. Totally attainable! Part of me hates myself for this too. I've quit a few times over the years but nothing that lasted through the next hard time (9 months at the longest period). 

I've even tried my state's quitline. They gave me Chantix which worked amazingly well too. Removed satisfaction through a cig but gave me creepy dreams so I quit taking it and started back up. 

I'm still here smoking and I'm sort of reaching a place in my mind where I'm ready to quit, but I'm afraid because my girlfriend has smoked even longer than I have. I think if I could quit I could inspire her too, eventually, but it would be all me at first. I don't know how I could stand up to cravings if/when she smoked in my presence. Or even just smelling it on her.

I want to get old watching my boys grow into men and give them everything I can. Except when I need a cig. I just give in and kill myself time and time again.

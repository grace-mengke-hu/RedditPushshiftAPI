Need some info on e-cigs

Hi,
I want to use e-cigs to quit, I just wanted to know a few things about them. 
The main reason I want to quit is because of how much if affects my ability to do exercise. You know when you've not smoked for a week and your lungs feel so much more open? Do I still get that from using an e-cig?
Also, are there any negatives I should know about? 
Thanks

29 hours thoughts and reasons

Wow, I feel great. No vape this time 100% cold turkey. I can actually keep my hands still, which before was worrying me while I was smoking thinking I had Parkinson's.

Decided to stick to it after this and explaining to my 10 year old sister what smoking is like:

"Think of not having a soda for a while and drinking a soda, It's about a tenth of how good tasting it is. Now think about craving a soda after not having one for a while, multiply that by 20,000. That's smoking. It's not even that good"

Really got me thinking. Onwards toward victory, this 
time I really want it.

Btw extra strength Tylenol stopped my withdrawal headaches!

5 Days, no cigarettes. A total of 7 hours NOT spent smoking.

7. HOURS. 

Seems so hard to believe I would have spent 7 waking hours mostly back on my deck smoking in just five days. According to my app, estimating 5 mins per cig.

No wonder I felt unproductive and lazy, among other reasons...like having no energy due to smoking.

So far I feel great, like a huge ball of anxiety was removed from my chest and replaced with a warm sense of peace that I made the right decision. 

My anxiety and chest pains have nearly gone away. 

The audible wheeze I used to hear in my chest went away. Which was a big, holy crap, this is bad for me moment which propelled my quit.

There are still some times when I feel a mostly emotional craving to smoke (while driving, and in moments of high stress...which has been often lately as a small business owner...) 

I have to remind myself that smoking won’t relieve my stress. I was still stressed as hell after having each and every cigarette which I thought I “needed” to cope and relax. 

Here’s to five more days. And then five more. 

Thanks for place to come, read and find solace with others who have been through the same.

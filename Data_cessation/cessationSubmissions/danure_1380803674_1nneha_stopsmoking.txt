21m, Stoptoper quitting question

So I am trying to give up smoking and this seems like a stupid question. 

I always tell people who wanna quit things that cold turkey is the way to go, but now I am tryna quit smoking I keep feeling like i should taper it, instead of smoking 15 rollups a day just smoke one or two to let the cravings pass. Is this a bad idea, I havn't smoked in two days but would really love to smoke one atm. Part of me is thinking; 

"just ride it out and dont smoke" 

Whereas another part is saying;

"just smoke a rolly, youll feel ill and you will again realize how much you dont want cigs"

Just need someone to give me a push in a direction.

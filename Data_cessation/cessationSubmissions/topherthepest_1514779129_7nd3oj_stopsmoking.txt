My best advice to all of you about to start.

I've made it two years now, and if feeling amazing isn't enough to convince anyone to lose the habit, the money I've saved has been amazing. My best advice to anyone quitting tonight is this... There are moments coming up where cravings are going to be horrible. A bad day at work, or a fight with a loved one "IS" coming. Be ready for it because the mind is a tricky bastard and is going to do its best to use those moments to excuse you from quitting. Be prepared to fight back on those moments. You all have it in you, Happy New Year, and good luck!

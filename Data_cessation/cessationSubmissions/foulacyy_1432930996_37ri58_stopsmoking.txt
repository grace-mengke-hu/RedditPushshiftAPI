Three.

72 hours. Today was a little rough, spent time around my mom who smokes like a chimney, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I don't feel as foggy today, and I feel like I'm actually done for good. I don't ever want that nasty shit in me again. 

Edit: proud to say I forced myself to go cold turkey, it was rough, but I feel better. Sorry I'm using this as a little journal lol

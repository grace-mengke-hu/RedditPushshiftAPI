Social smoker here wanting to quit

I use the word words social smoker to describe myself because I haven’t been smoking for a really long time. I started over a year ago and have probably smoked 100 cigarettes in total just guessing. 

I haven’t had a cigarette in a week and a half and would like to keep that streak going because I know all the risks that come with smoking and I don’t want to end up like some of my family members who have smoked for 20 or 30 years and face the risk of cancers.So I WANT to QUIT. 
The thing for me is and I know its going to sound stupid, but its like I have some sort of a dumb thought ingrained in my mind that I haven’t “smoked enough” yet to quit. Then combine that with the “smoking while drinking culture” and thus I find myself in a predicament. I have been vaping off and on and that has helped somewhat with my cravings but I’m scared I’ll give in the next time I am drinking or the next time I see someone else light one up. Again, I know it probably makes me sound stupid but that is where I am at right now. 

Anyone else ever feel the same? Any advice? This is a throwaway account but I’ll keep updating.

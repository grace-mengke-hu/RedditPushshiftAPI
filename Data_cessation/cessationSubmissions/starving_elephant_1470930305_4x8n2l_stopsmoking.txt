Day 3 Cold Turkey

Just reset my badge. I'm on day three cold turkey. It's actually one of my easier attempts. Cravings haven't been bad,  mostly it's just the mind games. I live with two smokers who were supposed to quit with me haha. Just keeping busy and trying to remember my goal. I started again after having my daughter,  who is one next month and I really want to quit for so many reasons but a big one is to watch her grow up.

How do I circumvent the environment?

I live in a dormitory in one of the most high stress b-schools in India. I picked up smoking in the first year of my MBA. I put on twenty kilos and lost my health. I desperately want to quit. But everyone here smokes. And I mean everyone. People hand out smokes instead of the traditional sweets for their birthday. Profs offer smokes if you meet the, in their rooms. Every dustbin is equipped with a strip to stub cigarettes. 

I am not able to resist in these circumstances. My fianc√© thinks I have quit:(. Any ideas?

Realized that drinking at bars is my trigger

So looks like I'm going to be stopping both, possibly adding social drinking back in later (thoughts on this are welcome). Definitely not going to the bar anytime soon.

I'm claiming my health back and working towards marriage in the foreseeable future.

Wish me luck.

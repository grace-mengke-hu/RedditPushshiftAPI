I quit this morning at midnight

...and I'm already off to a rough start. My SO and I both decided to quit, and shared the last one of a pack at midnight. Later that night, for reasons unrelated to cigarettes, we got into a fight, both suffered through a few panic attacks, and had an all-around bad time. Around 4 AM, SO went to pick up another pack, saying he wasn't mentally prepared and didn't even want to quit. He smoked one while I hid in the car and tried to avoid the smell. I was so stressed from the night, I wanted one so bad, but instead I stayed in the car and cried. On the way home, he listed off all the ways he would try to help me quit while not quitting himself. Not smoking at the apartment, trying to cover the smell, etc. I told him honestly, I didn't think I could quit if he wasn't going to. He looked at me, and tossed the brand new pack out the window. Just like that. 19 smokes, gone.

We are going to get through this together. It's going to be hard, but we love each other, and both want to see each other be healthier and happier, and to get the chance to potentially grow old together. I want to have his baby some day, and I will not have my unborn baby absorb all these toxins. I want to go to medical school, and I won't sit there and give medical advice to my patients, then go home and kill myself with cigarettes.

Thanks for reading my wall of text. I just needed a place to get everything off my chest.

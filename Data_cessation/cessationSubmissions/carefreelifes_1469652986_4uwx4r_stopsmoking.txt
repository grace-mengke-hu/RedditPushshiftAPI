Fingers crossed not another failed attempt.

I'm 24 years old and I started smoking after being in a toxic relationship. My justification was "you can't drink at work so might as well smoke". My family dislike that I smoke and my current partner shares the same opinion. I have tried on numerous occasions to stop but after a couple of days find myself giving in. It's Day 2 with no cancer stick. Can anyone give me any tips on how to overcome this addiction? I've tried the gum and that didn't work, haven't yet tried patches. Thanks all for your help.

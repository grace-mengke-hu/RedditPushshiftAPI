Restless sleep?

I quit smoking this past Monday, cold turkey. Things seem to be doing ok, other than I am super tired because I cant seem to sleep for more than half an hour at a time. I wake up pretty consistently, all through the night. Has anyone else had this problem? How long does it last? This, more than the lack of cigs, is driving me insane. Thanks for your time guys!



P.S.

I was a pretty heavy smoker; about 2 packs a day for 18 years or so.

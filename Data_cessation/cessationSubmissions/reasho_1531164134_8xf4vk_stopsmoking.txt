Quitting smoking by replacing with Snuff "Chewing" Tobacco?

Hi there. I recently decided to quit after relapsing again, but this time I decided that if I were going to have some sort of nicotine, I would only do it in a form that isn't "lighting up".

If I'm using chew, I'm basically going to keep feeding to that craving over and over again, especially since I'm not able to use it at work, right?

I do have cravings and sometimes they are strong, but I have little to no desire to actually smoke.

What are your respective opinions on using snuff as a replacement for smoking cigs? 

I appreciate it.

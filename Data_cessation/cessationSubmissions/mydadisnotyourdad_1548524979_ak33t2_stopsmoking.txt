Starting over, again.

I’ve been “quitting” since 2015. I’d go a couple of months at a time then “just have one”. Recently, I’d gone 8 months without smoking then “just one” turned into 6 months as a smoker. A recent cold/flu got me to kick the habit again and now I’m on day 6. It’s never just one, not for me anyways. I am focused on kicking this for good.

Hit a year and didn't even realise!

Haven't been here in around 9 months, strange to even think I used to smoke. So yeah I hit my first full year and completely forgot about it, which to me is good news, to think I care so little about smoking I somehow forgot I hadn't smoked in a full year is mind blowing to me when I think back to how much I used to smoke. I know a lot of people say but it really does get easier, so much easier in fact. Best decision I've ever made.

2 months today. Also, my chain smoking sister followed suit and she's 24 days smoke free herself.

Very happy about the 2 months milestone, cravings don't "hurt" anymore and these days I have this weird feeling about my gums: they tickle, they're like waking up after a long sleep and feeling alive, it's quite funny. I don't even recall when they were as pink as they are now.

But the best feeling has to be that my sister quit smoking herself after 15 years of 30 (yes THIRTY) cigarettes a day.
She's still nervous af these days and has the cough, but she's pretty happy and resisting!

Stay strong everyone :-) thanks for all the advice and kind words.

edit: my flair says 58, but I'm still counting february as a full month what the heck :D

Day 2.

Things are strange, though not as strange as they could be.

Went to the zoo today, 2 hours out of town, for free, completely by chance.  The same zoo I tried to go to almost exactly 10 years ago to the day, but failed because my wife got sick at the hotel, and so I had to hurry her home, only to find out that my sister killed herself once we got there.

I started smoking (again) when she died.  Started with cigars for a couple of years, went to freebasing cigarettes again a couple of years later.

I quit again yesterday, and the new symbolism is just happening by itself.  I got to hang out with my out-of-town remaining sister today, and a bit later see the zoo animals with a couple of good people.  I even got paid reasonably-well for the whole trip -- and I'm still not smoking or otherwise consuming nicotine.

Which seems way more positive than almost anything I've written in quite awhile.

Yay?  Yeah, yay - I guess.  Now if I could stop thinking about food, or just itching and poking at myself, or chewing my nails, or eating food, or chewing, or eating.

It's gonna be like that, I guess.

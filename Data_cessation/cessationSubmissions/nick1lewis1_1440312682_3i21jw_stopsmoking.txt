Allen Carr hasn't worked

So I've read Allen Carr acclaimed book 3 times now, after reading for the first time I managed to successfully stop for 2 weeks.  However, this was while on holiday and I often find I can quit smoking while away from home.  You're generally relaxed, out of your usual habits and patterns, it's much easier. I've tried since reading the book and have stopped for at least a week each time.  I've smoked for 13 years now and it's time to quit.  I'm really nervous about picking the book back up and have considered addiction medication like Champix.  Shall I read Allen Carr's book again!>

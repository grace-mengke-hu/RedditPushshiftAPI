Help..

I am actually terrified. Over the last 3 days I've done a puff or two (three?) of a cigarette every day at a party.. and i just had a panic attack because I don't want to become a smoker. The parties are part of the programme of the trip and attendance is mandatory, and now either i stand around all alone because I can't hang out with my old friends anymore (because they're friends with ex and ex an I aren't on good terms) OR i go hang out with my classmates where there's always at least 3 cigarettes lit and I'm being offered one every couple of minutes despite saying no. Yesterday I did only one and then successfully rejected all other, but I'm worried about the second hand smoke..

Is it too late? What can I do to stop myself from giving in to pressure..

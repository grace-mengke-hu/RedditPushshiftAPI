My shirt pocket shame is an hourly humiliation re: personal discipline.

I've finally come to terms with what bothers me most about this habit. Sure, the stink, the health concerns, the overall hygiene implications are terrible, but they've never lasted long enough as a motivation.

This habit, which I've clung to for a decade, indicates a lack of discipline. I plan to hold onto this as my motivation. I'm starting today, I've gone months before, but never stuck it out for life. No more.

I've worn this shame in my shirt pocket for far too long.

Goodbye cigarettes, I'll not miss you.

Quit Smoking Journey

Hello everyone. I am a 21 year old canadian who has been smoking half a pack to a pack for 7 years. My first experience with smoking was when i was 12 living in a group home i would go out and pretend to "catch crickets" with a friend. We would smoke cigarettes and get a buzz feeling from it. 
Being a child i never truly understood what addiction was. I thought i could break free of any trap and could never get addicted to anything. Years down the road i have realized what a fool i use to be. 
Two halloweens ago on halloween night i went into surgery for a pneumothorax on my left lung. It was a hellish experience which i will never forget. I have developed eczema on my skin, and am also under weight.
It's kind of a hard feeling to explain but given my youth i feel when i stop smoking i go from the energy of an old man to a child. I feel cigarettes robbed me of that energy and i wish to reclaim it.

Along with quitting smoking i will also be stopping alcohol, weed and coffee as i already know these are my strongest triggers.  
I hope to update this journey everyday for at-least a week.

All the cigarette butts are gone

I always went outside on my porch to smoke. Im 12 days smoke free today, and haven’t been outside on the porch since my last cigarette. Yesterday i got the urge to go out and clean up the porch. Threw out my old ashtray and any stray butts laying around. I have to say it felt SO NICE! My porch is nice and clean, my plants outside even seem to be growing better since i stopped going out every hour for a smoke (much like myself). Im doing so good. I got this 💪🏻🤘🏻

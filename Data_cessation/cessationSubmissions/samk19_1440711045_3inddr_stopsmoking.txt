Is shaking a withdrawal symptom?

Its been about 24 hours since I had a cigarette. I've been on the patch for a few days. A little while ago I started shaking like crazy and it only seems to be getting worse. Mostly my hands. Is this a withdrawal symptom? If so, is there anything I can do to make myself stop shaking?

Having some trouble, but haven't given up.

So, I have not touched a cigarette in 12 days. Cold turkey, nothing to help. I've only had one dream about smoking, and I don't really think I went through withdrawals, or if I did, they weren't bad and I didn't notice it.

What I'm having an issue with now is self esteem and stress management. I've now gained weight, I can feel the water weight, I feel bloated, and disgusting. I worked my ass off for over a year to lose 60 pounds, and to gain weight like this just terrifies me. I knew it would happen, and it was my rationalization for why I smoked for a long, long time. 

And OH. MY. GOD. The fucking stress. I can't fucking take it. I have people in my life that are so incredibly difficult to deal with, and now I KNOW they are the reason I smoked. Otherwise, I would have murdered them by now. I don't give a fuck who you are, you don't treat people like shit just because you think you can. Now, without the nicotine, I feel myself shaking in anger, I can feel my heart trying to bust out of my chest, and I can feel myself slipping into a grey area where who the fuck knows what I could do. I am so ANGRY, ALL THE TIME. With cigarettes, I was way less stressed, I had a release, a routine. Now I just don't know what the fuck to do with myself. My poor son, I lash out at him sometimes for minor things, and I feel like a terrible parent because of it. Now, I don't hit him or anything like that, but I'll yell at him for things he's never gotten yelled at before, just that my patience is so thin that everything annoys the shit out of me, and that's not fair to him. It breaks my fucking heart.

This community is so amazing, please give me a light at the end of the tunnel. I could really use a swift kick in the ass, too.

A week in - no physical cravings... but a niggling feeling that I'd be happier if I'd never stopped smoking.

I'm used to stopping smoking and novelty is usually the thing that carries me through the first week or two without much difficulty. The physical cravings seem to be quite easy to beat. The joy of having stopped (Ã  la Allen Carr) is real, but it fades ever faster every time I stop.

Although the nicotine has definitely left my body, I'm starting to crave cigarettes a little bit.

Something in my head is telling me that I'd be a stronger person if I started smoking again and that I'd be happier and just more content if I stopped pretending I'm going to be able to stay quit... if I stopped pretending that I even want to stay quit.

I'm not going to try one - I know it would taste disgusting and I'd hate having the stink on my clothes. It's funny though how nicotine keeps it's grasp on you, even when it's left your body... And how the tobacco advertising industry managed to so thoroughly indoctrinate me in the ways of smoking.

How do I reclaim the joy of having stopped?

Two months, holy crap - 10 things I've learned

I've noticed a few things. Sorry for the wall of text in advance.

1) I still get pangs of cravings. But they aren't normal "I-really-need-a-cigarette-right-now" cravings, they're "I *could* use a cigarette right now," and then I think, "Why? You'll smell like smoke, you'll beat yourself up, it isn't worth it." And it goes **away**. As soon as I preoccupy myself, they're gone. I'd rather deal with little tiny thoughts for the rest of my life than smelling like smoke and sacrificing my health.

2) I initially replaced cigarettes with food, but that's starting to level off now. Excess habits are starting to break left and right.

3) Things seriously *taste* and *smell* different. I didn't really expect it, but things I really enjoyed before I stopped smoking I actually don't now. I use less salt on food. I can instantly tell if there was a smoker in the restroom a few minutes before me. I can tell a smoker when they walk into a room. My perfume actually stays on all day.

4) I don't have to stand out in the increasingly-uncomfortable warm weather to suck down a cigarette. One of my biggest fears is wasps, and now I don't have to worry if I'm going to get stung by one just standing outside smoking.

5) The smell was a big deterrent for me. Health was less of a factor when I quit, but it's becoming increasingly a factor as I get used to not smelling like smoke.

6) My teeth have whitened! Incredible.

7) My dating prospects have opened up since I quit. Now I've got a few dates lined up with guys who aren't smokers, who consider smoking a dealbreaker.

8) I'm handling stress much easier now. I never thought I'd say that, after 9 years of using smoking as a stress reliever. I'm actually confronting issues and owning up to social mistakes rather than just going outside and smoking to "get away from it."

9) I don't have to accommodate my habit when I go out anymore. So instead of asking "Does [the bar] allow smoking?" now, I find myself saying, "How's the cocktails?" or "How's the food?" I've been able to open up a lot of options to me that I didn't even explore before because the establishment didn't allow smoking.

10) Just by me quitting, I've helped spark my friends to quit. One of my roommates is a month in, and two of my closest friends have set their quit date for a month from now. Just by being someone who has successfully turned away from cigarettes and has no desire to go back, I've become an inspiration for people who know me. That's a big motivator to help me stay smoke-free! :)

**YOU CAN DO IT.** Stay strong!

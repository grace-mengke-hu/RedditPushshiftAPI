I used to love to go on long road trips and chain smoking. Today I drove 8 hours. As I lay here trying to sleep, I just realized that smoking a cigarette never even crossed my mind the entire time I was on the road. It’s an incredible feeling. 

Good luck new quitters. Just take things an hour at a time. You can do it. It’s worth it.

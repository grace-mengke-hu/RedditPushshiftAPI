A fun tid bit

Not sure how true this is (read it on a web-md knockoff,) but apparently the dizziness/light-headedness  experienced in the first few weeks without nicotine is not caused by a decrease in anything(aside from nicotine), but rather by more oxygen reaching the brain than usual. 

I was super stoked about this. Sometimes the dizziness is weird, but it just means you're getting high on clean air. How cool is that!?!

Used a phrase at a bar that I can happily get used to!

Last night I was out at a bar with my partner and some friends. Cravings were high- which I expected. This bar is one of our regular hangout spots and a favorite smoking patio. About half way through being there the camel rep came through, offering coupons/vouchers. I always used to get excited because that was my brand, of course I'd like to save some money. 

Instead I got to say, "Thanks, but I dont smoke" 

From that point on in my night the cravings were negligable and I got to enjoy a moment of self pride. I've quit before, but this time I feel free and know I wont go back to it. I like being a non smoker. I think I'll keep it up! 

If you're having a hard time, just realize that those times pass. If I can do it, anyone can. It's so worth it.

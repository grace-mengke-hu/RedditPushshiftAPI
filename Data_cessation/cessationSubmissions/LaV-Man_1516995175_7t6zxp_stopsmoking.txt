Hello, my name is LaV-Man and I am a smoker...

I quit smoking 20JAN18, 25 days ago.  Holy crap this sucks.  It's gotten to the point where I can go for some intervals without thinking about smoking.  Usually 20 to 30 minutes.  

It funny how my brain tries to convince me that 'one cigarette' won't hurt, and how nice it would be to 'have a smoke, then go back on the wagon'.

I am committed to not smoking, not even once, ever again, but man it's hard.  how long before you were completely 'over it'?

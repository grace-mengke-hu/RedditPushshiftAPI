Vaping to help quit?

Maybe you may view this as just a substitute (one bad habit for another), but I started doing a lot of research on vaping as an alternative to smoking. 6-days ago, I made the plunge and bought some vaping equipment and 4-days ago, I received it in the mail. 

My last cigarette has also been 4-days ago and I really, REALLY can say that I am not craving at all.

My goal is to eventually become fully nicotine independent. However, I subjectively believe that vaping is a safer alternative to cigarettes, even if I can agree that it is not without risk.

In case you are interested, I decided to blog my progress, including items that I have purchased and what I think of them so far. I plan to update my progression.: http://ontovaping.blogspot.com/

Do some research on the subject however, I really think it is a good alternative.

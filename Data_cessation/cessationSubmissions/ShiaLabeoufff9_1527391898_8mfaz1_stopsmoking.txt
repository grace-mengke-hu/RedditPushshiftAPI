Clearer skin

Idk if anyone has this but my pores are HUGE and when I quit smoking, only a day later they started to close up. I know it’s kind of superficial but I’m very hard on myself, my appearance, and my skin has never healed itself like it did when I had no nicotine in my system. Currently at about an hour of non smoking, I’ve been on and off all day. It’s been a hard few weeks, going back and forth with them. I decided to get back on the patch, stay on it for a week and try to quit cold turkey again. If it gets too hard for me I’ll go back on the patch. Not one more puff.

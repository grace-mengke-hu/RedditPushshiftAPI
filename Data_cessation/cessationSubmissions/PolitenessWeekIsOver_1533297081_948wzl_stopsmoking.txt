Long term quitters, do you occasionally smoke?

This seems like a taboo topic on this sub but I really want to know. There are many people who smoke occasionally, but I don't know many people who smoke occasionally after quitting (But I don't know many quitters in general). Is it that you think you will relapse after 1 cigarette or its just that the whole past experience has left a bad taste in your mouth? 

I ask this because I have anxiety issues about not being allowed to do something. I will not do it, but I like to have the option. The whole rhetoric about not another puff no matter what actually scares me a lot. Also I don't think I hate cigarettes the way everyone else here does. I know they are bad for me, so I don't do it. But I'm not disgusted by the idea of smoking. 

PS: I really don't like the term quitter in this context, what would be a better descriptor?

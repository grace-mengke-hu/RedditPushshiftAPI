Please help, quitting tomorrow and terrified

I must sound like a whiny wuss. But I do feel a kind of panic.
I am chain smoking right now (sorry new,  donâ€™t mean to trigger anybody). 
I am a a little excited,but very scared.
Scared I will fail, scared of what lies ahead, will I be a mess? Will I be able to sleep? Will I ever feel happy again?

But I hate being a smoker. 

Did anyone one else feel this way the day before quitting?

Three weeks in!

Three weeks without cigarettes. The first day or two I used camel snus pouches to keep my mouth/hands occupied as well as not bite my girlfriend's head off from nicotine withdrawal. After those first two days, i've been completely tobacco/nicotine withdrawal and I feel great!! I eat a lot of food now at times when I used to routinely smoke. Also, my sense of smell is 20 times better now that I can breathe through my nose. Just really happy right now

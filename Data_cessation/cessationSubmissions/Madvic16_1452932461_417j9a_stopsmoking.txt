Just 6 days, checking in here

This is my third attempt, so far my longest period was one year without smoking. I hope this time it really lasts... So far so good, without any chemical aid.
I realize the post sucks, so I will try to improve:
I decided (for the third time at least) to definitively quit smoking, I'm 54, smoking since 16 or so... Why? I want to enjoy life after retirement (also before, but especially after), which is only 10 years from now, hopefully.
Why exactly now?? This is opportunistic, I had to travel to China, that's 14 hours flying, so not smoking at all. I said to myself, with this kick start (say, 8 hours sleep + 14 hours flying = 22 hours without smoking), it should be easy to continue... Well, it is working so far, already 6 days and an average of 10 cravings per day.
I came back home yesterday, so now starts the really tough part, being at home, where smoking is easy (not the case when you are in hotel rooms, etc..). 
I'm using the "Smoke Free" application for iPhone, it helps me a lot.
Cheers

I'm coming up on two months. Treading water metaphorically.

Quitting smoking is a lot like standing on the edge of a pool. The water is a little cold so there's hesitation about jumping in. Once you work up the nerve to go through with it, and endure the uncomfortable adjustment, the water is fine. Smiling because you faced your challenge and overcame with triumph.

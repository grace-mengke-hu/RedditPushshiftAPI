Did you quit smoking? $100 top prize for stories.


Hello everyone,

I am working on a book right now called "How I Quit" which will be a collection of 101 brief essays from former smokers on how they successfully quit smoking. Each interviewee will essentially write how they started smoking, the struggles they had over the years (health, failed attempts, etc.), ultimately how they overcame the addiction and end with tips/tricks that worked for them and, finally, how it has bettered their life. Each interviewee will be only identified by name (first name and last initial), and age.

This 'interview' will be more of a free-flowing article you will have written as if you were explain your story to a person for the first time, so can be done 100% by an email response.

1) Must have smoked at least 10 years.
2) Must have completely quit smoking at least 1 year as of today and off nicotine replacements as of one year today.

My goal is to show smokers struggling with this addiction different stories of people all in one place (this book) that have been there and that can offer them some encouragement -- and hopefully save lives!

If interested, please email me your stories (you can write as much as you feel comfortable about journey from smoker to non-smoker and what you did to finally kick the habit) and I may use it for the upcoming book.

** Top story will be awarded $100 cash either by PayPal or a $100 gift card (sent electronically) of their choice.  This will be awarded on 12/25/15.


Thank you.

Nicorette Spray ad wrong

I was thinking of posting this in r/ads but thought it might be better suited for this subreddits.

In the nicorette spray ad the guy sprays it directly into his mouth and immediately inhales. This is the wrong way to use the spray.

I work in pharmacy and have been trained by J&J in all their NRT products.

The proper way to use this product is to spray it in your mouth into your cheek and is not to be inhaled.

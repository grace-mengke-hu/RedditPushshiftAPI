It's all getting better!

I was at a house party on saturday night and was offered a ton of cigs by people who i've helped out in the past, yet somehow the drunken lesser-willed version of myself managed to say no to all of them. It seriously felt good on the night knowing i'd kept my word to myself, I got to wake up the next morning without the horrible breath which was an even bigger bonus.

Saying no isn't that hard in practice, much easier than what I thought it was going to be. I literally see no reason to continue smoking now. Besides the cravings it is just a money pit (especially here in england) not to mention my physical health has improved considerably.

Hang in there everyone, it all gets better.

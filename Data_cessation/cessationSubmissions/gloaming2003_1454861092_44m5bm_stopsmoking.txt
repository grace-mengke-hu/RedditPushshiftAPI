Nervous about quitting

Planning on this coming Friday (2/12/16) as my quit date, but I'm pretty nervous. My husband, also a smoker, doesn't exactly support my decision because he isn't ready to quit. My main reasons are for my health and our finances (we spend $300/month on cigarettes!). If he doesn't end up quitting, I don't know what I'm going to do! Any advice?

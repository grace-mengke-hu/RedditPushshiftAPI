Day 1, feeling ditzy and light headed?

Hey quitters,

I'm about 20 hours smoke free!!! However, I have this bizarre weightless feeling in my head. Like I'm just incapable of focusing on anything. It's not quite a headache, but it's definitely in my head. Even trying to describe it, I feel like a crazy person. It's pretty distressing because I'm used to being able to be focused and aware. 

Has anyone else experienced something similar? Looking for reassurance.

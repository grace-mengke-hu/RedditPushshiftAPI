One weird thing I wish I'd known.

I'm approaching 2 months smoke-free, after second attempt this year using Easy Way. I started smoking 27 years ago.

It's been a little difficult at times. When I think about smoking, it feels the same as grief. I still want to smoke badly at times. 

Here's the part that is purely bananas. My husband smokes. Right now there are probably 3 packs of his cigarettes around the house. There's been this supply nearby the whole time. But I don't want one of his smokes. I don't want one as much as I don't want to stick a fork in my eye. It's not going to happen.

But I would knock you over for one of my smokes, the brand I smoked starting 3-4 years ago. I want my brand! It's sick. Three weeks ago, I dreamt I bought a pack and smoked one. In the dream  I could see the familiar colors and feel the sharp corners of the pack and the texture of the paper like it was really happening. I was very upset, both in the dream and when I woke up. The next few days in real life felt like I had freshly quit, like the dream reset my progress.

I know this is the brainwashing and not the nicotine like the book says, but it's rough. I'm too scared to drink.

I hope this is a quirk of my own psychology and not some creepy evil chemical manipulation done by my former Big Tobacco overlords. If you're thinking of quitting, start by breaking up with your brand first. If I ever go through this again I'll never buy the same kind twice.

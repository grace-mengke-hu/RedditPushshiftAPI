Don't let it bother you.

Don't let it get to you either. That is what I'm going to keep in mind. If you think about it, those cravings don't last long, and if you use your brain to analyze the situation and weigh the pro's and con's against one another, you will find that there is no reason to falter. Don't let a pos chemical and a physical dependence (illusion) control you. YOU MUST OVERCOME. Today is my "Day 1". I have been here a thousand times already throughout my life. Now I will not try, I will actually do. I'm sick of it. The bad associated with smoking outweighs the good, and you must realize it has absolutely no benefit to you. I will have to avoid certain people, and keep myself very busy for the first few days to a week, but it is all worth it. Good luck to you all, but I doubt luck will help you  in any way. Use the power you have within and break those chains!

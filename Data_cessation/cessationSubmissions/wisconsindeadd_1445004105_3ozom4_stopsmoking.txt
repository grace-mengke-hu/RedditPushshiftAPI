Got my Star!

Can't believe it. My health has gotten so much better its crazy. My anxiety is way down. Resting heart rate is also way down. Just feeling better and more capable. Still think about smoking everyday :( but I'm sticking with it and I've begun to think about it far less. Thanks for the encouragement everyone!

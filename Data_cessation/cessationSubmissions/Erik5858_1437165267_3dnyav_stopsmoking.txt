6 Months Today!!!

Never thought I'd see the day. This sub-reddit  has truly helped me with this! The last year before I quit I was at 10 cigarettes approximately a day. I tried to cut back because I went thru sessions with a professional doctor and he told me if I cut back it would be easier to quit. It wasn't easy and I'm glad it wasn't because I don't wanna go thru it again. Here's My Statistics:

*Savings so far: $812.08

*Days smoke free: 180.46    
*Life regained (hours): 1082.78

Help me.

I realllllllllllllllllllllly want and need to quit smoking.


I've realized it doesn't affect just me anymore, but everyone I come in contact with every day. I find myself thinking "Well, I can do that, but will I have a break to smoke?" It gets so inconvienent I've actually stopped going to my uni classes because it's a 'smoke free zone' and I can't smoke in between classes. 


Basically, I know the reasons I need to quit.. I need some true life stories on what you guys enjoyed once you've quit. This is so hard for me as I have an extremely addictive personality, and while I'm doing this I'll be trying to sober up from alcohol. I'd love your guy's advice.

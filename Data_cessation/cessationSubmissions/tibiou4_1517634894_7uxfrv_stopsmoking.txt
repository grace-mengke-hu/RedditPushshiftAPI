Anyone else losing hair after quitting?

Iâ€™m a little over two weeks into my quit and have been noticing much much more hair loss than normal. I have very noticeable bare patches on my neck and my head hair has been shedding pretty rapidly.   

Has anyone else experienced anything like this after quitting? The bald spots on my neck look a lot like alopecia and appeared within a matter of days but my head has no distinct spots and is simply shedding more rapidly.

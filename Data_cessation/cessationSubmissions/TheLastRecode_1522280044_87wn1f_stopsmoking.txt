Been At It For 48 Hours â€¢ My Experience

Hey guys,

For the past 10 years I've been smoking between 1 pack to 2 packs a day. I have tried quitting several times in the past, trying different ways.

This time I decided to just stop. No dialing it back gradually, no sneaking a puff or two, no gum or any of that kind of stuff. 

It's been 48ish hours,

- In the first 6 hours just normal cravings and then slept for 10 hours
- For the next 12 hours the cravings occured every 45 minutes, give or take a few, gradually got worse in intensity and longer, lasting up to 30 minutes.
- For the next 5 hours I was in a lot of pain but absolutely 0 cravings.
- Slept for 8 hours, woke up, and all day till now I still feel a little pain but the intense craving is gone. Occasionally feel a craving but it doesn't bother me anymore.


What I've done, maybe it helps, maybe not.

- Stay Hydrated, drank a lot of water.
- Spent a lot of time in a sauna and exercised.
- I love Spicy food. I love the way it burns, kind of like smoking. (P.S. The way things taste now was worth the struggle)
- When I felt an intense craving I would drink coffee or eat a piece of 90% dark chocolate. Bitter things seemed to get rid of the cravings.

1000 days without a cigarette

Today was 1000 days without a cigarette.

For unrelated reasons, I had to scan a copy of my mother's death certificate.

She was a lifetime smoker, and spent the last year of her life with an oxygen tube in her nose. She went to emergency monthly, and eventually weekly. She slowly suffocated to death.  

She was proud I quit smoking, and she regretted starting.

Please don't smoke, it's not worth it.

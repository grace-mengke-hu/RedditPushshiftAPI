Difficulty breathing 3 weeks after quitting

I've quit smoking 3 weeks ago cold turkey. I was smoking about 7-15 cigarettes a day for 5 years. About 5 days ago I started to feel like I had difficulty breathing. I've had a full check at the hospital, everything seems absolutely fine. Had anybody here experienced similar symptoms after quitting? Ironically I never had these kind of problems when smoking.

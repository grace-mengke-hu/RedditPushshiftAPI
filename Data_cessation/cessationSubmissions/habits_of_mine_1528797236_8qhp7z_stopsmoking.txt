531 day cigarette free - got hooked on nicotine thru vaporizer in the last two months - quitting today!

It's been almost 1.5 years since I quit smoking cigarettes and everything has been great. About two months ago I started smoking JUUL (an e-cigarette with really high nicotine content), and I'm addicted to it for sure. Iâ€™ve been in a state of ignoring my problem by justifying the fact that e-cigs are less unhealthy than regular cigs. Truth is I don't want to be a smoker of any kind. Today I decided to quit JUUL cold turkey the same way I quit cigarettes in the first place. Wish me luck guys!

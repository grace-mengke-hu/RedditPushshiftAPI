Lucky 13!

13 days without a smoke.  Yeah, I use an e-cigarette with delicious banana cream pie 12mg liquid to quit.  What an awesome feeling! Next week I'll be stepping down ecig dosage from 12mg to 6mg.  Hopefully by the middle to end of June I'll be completely nicotine/ecig free!  

Best of luck on your journey while quitting cigarettes.  Like many things in life.. it's not easy, but it's rewards are far greater than the struggle you go through to get there.

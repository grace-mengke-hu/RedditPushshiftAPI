Im sorry i did it again

Today was my day 2 .I was really stressed out today about what i was going to do and i ended up buying a cigarette and had a smoke . 

How do you guys deal with stress and fear ? I have always been a little bit depressed . Cigarettes are my only stress relief its been a habit to do smoke whenever i get stressed what should i do to handle this weakness ?

Ill reset my badge and start again tomorrow .

3 cigarettes left..... HELP

A little backstory. I've done some sort of tobacco since I was 15. I dipped from 15-19 because I played a lot of sports. I switched to cigarettes out of HS because I started smoking cannabis and always had cottonmouth. 

Now I'm 23 and 50% of the time i smoke a pack every day and a half and the other 50% I smoke a pack a day. I have tried to quit countless times, and I never make it more than a day. I always say I'm going to quit when I'm broke, but always try and scrounge up change. 

I hate to admit it, but I have even stolen change from my parents when I lived with them(wasn't much, not noticible, but its the point that matters). I feel like a supreme piece of shit because I always go paycheck to paycheck. my spending on cigarettes far outweighs my spending on cannabis.

So here I am, just got paid today, paid the car payment, the rent, and paid back a friend. I have 20 dollars left in my bank account for 2 weeks. car is on empty, and I have 3 cigarettes left...

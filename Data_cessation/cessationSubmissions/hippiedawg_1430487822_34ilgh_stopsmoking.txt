Quitting is easy. I've done it a thousand times.

Almost literally. A. thousand. I'm at day 3. This time feels different because instead of seeing quitting as a deprivation of enjoyment, I'm seeing what I, my family, and pets are gaining. One last cigg will lead to more. I remind myself the withdrawal is not physical pain and will pass. Every time I get the urge, I think "i'm not a smoker," and when the urge passes, I think "FUCKIN A, I'M NOT A SMOKER," and dance a little.

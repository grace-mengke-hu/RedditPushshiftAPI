Have been doing great until... huge upset...?

I've been doing great with little to no cravings, tremendous energy, able to breathe, etc... I have even felt moments of calm I haven't felt in ages. UNTIL... today... I have taken offence to the way someone spoke to me. I don't know why but it feels like they just stabbed me in the guts. I know I am being overly sensitive to a probably minor provocation... but I'm just stricken with emotion, anger, wanting retribution, wanting to strike back and show them the dark side.... What the heck... ??? I feel awful about this. Is this my addiction and mind screwing with me or what? How do I handle this?

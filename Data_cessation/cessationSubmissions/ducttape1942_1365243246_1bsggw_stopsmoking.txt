Am I the only one?

Alright so I came across this sub tonight because I've been seriously considering quitting for about a month now. All the stories I've been reading on here people seem to be like It's been 3 to 12 days and I feel amazing, I can breath, I have no stress etc. I have quit a couple times twice for more than a month and every time I feel miserable the entire time. I feel tired all the time, really aggravated all the time, and it really hurts to run until I finally give in and start smoking again. Basically I just want to know if others have quit and felt like this for a prolonged period of time and is there any actual reason besides for withdrawal effects and the mental addiction.

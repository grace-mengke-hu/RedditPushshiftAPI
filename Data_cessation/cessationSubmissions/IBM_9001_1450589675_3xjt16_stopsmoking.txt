Quitting the patch "cold turkey"?

I've been on the 14 mg patch for 4 weeks now. I sometimes forget to put it on and don't use it for half a day then remember and put it on later with no signs of craving. I've worn my current one for 2 days. I'm beginning to think I don't need the 7 mg patch, but also don't want to suddenly lose my mind. Anyone stopped without stepping down before?

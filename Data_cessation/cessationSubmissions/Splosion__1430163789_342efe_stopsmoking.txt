Thinking of starting chantix again.

I've tried to quit smoking in the past and succeeded a few times through some pretty extreme circumstances but I've kept going back since I live in a house with other smokers. However I will be moving soon so I figure now is a good time to stop for good. 

I took chantix briefly in the past but stopped because I couldn't handle the weird sleep and fever dreams I got while on it. Any advice if I go that route again? Any better alternative drugs?

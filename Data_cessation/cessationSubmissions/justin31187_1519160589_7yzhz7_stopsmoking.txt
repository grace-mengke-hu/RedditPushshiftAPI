8 months smoke free

Update February 2018: (8 months smoke free) After 13 years of addiction. I am finally free. Iâ€™m 30 years old. 

Been smoke free since June 16, 2017. It took 6 months for the morning cravings to go away. I still get cravings every now and then, usually after eating. But then I chew a piece of gum and forget about it. I feel so much better now and I can finally breathe. Took up a new hobby of cycling as a way of exercise for New Years resolution. I ride 8-12 miles every other day. FeelsGoodMan.  

P.S. my breath smells like skittles and starbursts

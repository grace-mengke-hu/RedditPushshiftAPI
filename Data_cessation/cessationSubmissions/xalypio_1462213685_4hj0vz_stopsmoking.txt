It's been 10 days...

and through complex calculations scientists were able to tell me that i did not smoke 100 cigarettes. I don't know where they are but i did definitely not smoke em.

Before i quit i used an inhaler and antihistamin pills to live with my allergic asthma. I had to use the inhaler about 2 or 3 times a day. On day one of not smoking i didn't need to use it at all. Neither did i need the pills. I don't care if my nose/eyes itch. I just used that stuff to breathe properly and it's so much better now.

I don't want to smoke again and right now it feels like the best thing i ever did, but i quit a few months before and started again after a week, so who knows what the future will bring. There's always time to be incredibly stupid. But i'm positive that i'll remember how much better i feel now for a while, so that will me keep going.

On the negative side: I rediscovered my vape 2 days ago... I don't carry it to work, i do not have any cravings for it if it's not around but i like vaping that mocca juice (without nic of course) from time to time when i'm at home. So i wonder if i want to put that stuff behind me too... 

oh, i forgot: Thanks very much to everyone participating here!

Almost 17 days in and I'm hanging on in there!

So my Smoke Free app mission for the day is to tell someone new that I've quit smoking.  As I'm not in contact with many people any more due my parallel 20 year weed habit turning me into a virtual recluse, I'm telling you good people!

After 26 years of smoking about 15 roll-ups per day, and it being over 10 years since I last even tried to give up smoking, I quit everything last month - and I've done well so far.

My physical cravings have died right down, although there's been times lately when my energy has been really low and my willpower has been weak. My breathing, circulation, sense of smell and taste are all better than they've been for years.  

According to the Smoke Free app, I've not smoked 254 smokes, gained 4 days of life and beaten 91 serious cravings. There's been times that I've been grumpy, times that I've despaired at having to keep this up for the rest of my life, times I've thought  the effort is not worth the reward.

But do you know what happened today?  My ten year old daughter gave me a hug at bedtime, said she was happy I didn't smell like cigarettes any more, and that she was proud of me.

To anyone reading this - find your motivation. Even if it's just for your own self-esteem, keep at it. Tell yourself - just one. More. Day.  Resist the cravings for another day and tackle the next day with a renewed energy bank. Take a few deep breaths and consider your lungful of unadulterated air the reward you have earned for successfully fighting this addiction.  

You can do it - we're all with you, and happy to give advice and support you!

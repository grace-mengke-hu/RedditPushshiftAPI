How can I encourage my partner to stop smoking?

He has now been smoking for about 14 years and smokes about ten a day and more when he out with friends.

He knows I hate the smoking and always have and I have always told him I refuse to even start trying for children until he has stopped for at least a few months, he gets that and said he will stop for that.

I don’t know why all of a sudden I hate it more than usual - I am sick of the smell of smoke on him and his breath stinking like an ash tray. The thing that bothers me most is after a night out of excessive smoking his chest wakes me up because he is so wheezy and his throat is making some weird cackling noise.

I’m starting to become more angry because I know this will have an effect on our future when it comes back on him and effects his health.

I have tried speaking to him about this so much but he always just rolls his eyes and says I nag at him too much about it, I don’t understand because I’ve never been addicted to something. He really doesn’t try though, he has an ecig and when it runs out of charge he is too lazy to recharge it. He refuses to try any other method.

Would really appreciate if you have any tips to go about this, it’s not making me totally question my relationship with him but I don’t really want a future with someone who is going to have continuous health problems because he has smoked so much. I can already hear how much it is effecting his chest.

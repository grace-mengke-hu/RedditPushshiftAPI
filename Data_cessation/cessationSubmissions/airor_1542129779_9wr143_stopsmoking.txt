Failed again

I've been quitting now for a month and I my longest stretch has been 3 days (yay!) this weekend.   In fact I just got in from failing again today.  Getting through an entire day at work seems to be a sticking point.  Thanks to everyone for posting here though, it's helping.  I really have to stop.

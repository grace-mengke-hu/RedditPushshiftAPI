Let's crank up the difficulty.

At the end of this month, I am moving out of the house I shared with my now ex-wife. I lost my dogs, 24/7 access to my kid, and a marriage. So you know what I'm gonna do? Second I walk out of this house for the last time, I'm throwing my cigarettes in the trash. I've smoked for 11 years, might as well be one good change to come out of this situation. Wish me luck!

So um i made a post a while back and i am still trying to quit i talk about quiting all the time to my friends and family members but i try and i try and i just cannot withdrawl kicks in and it just becomes to much my lungs and my throat are detoriating to the point where i was struggling to breath

it hurt to breath i went to the mall got some nicorette and a e cigarette i broke the e cigarette charging it by screw the charging unit in to tight and breaking the entire e cigarette trying to get it out it was a gift from a friend who went with me to get it after that i have just been feeling so vunerable that i caved and smoked knowing full well that my lungs would not have it i am 17 i am scared that i might have lung cancer and throat cancer words cannot describe my fear but i can not stop i feel trapped in a corner i am to young to have cancer and if i do am i going to die.i do not want to die i have so much left to do i have so much left to live for.but i am afraid the world only has so much left for me.i am sorry for the bad grammar it is not that i do not have the ability to write properly it is is that i am in to much pain to care

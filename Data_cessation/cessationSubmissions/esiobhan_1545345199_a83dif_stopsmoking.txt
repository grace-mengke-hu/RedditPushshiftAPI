4d 9h 30m

The first few days were surprisingly easy.  So far day 3/4 have been the worst for nic fits.  Or well for me feeling twitchy as all get out and defensively angry before bursting into tears.

As someone who deals with general anxiety and depression it's easy to  look at what's going on and realise it for what it is.  I'm also feeling some relief each time I manage to hold out during another fit and still maintain a positive outlook on what I'm doing.  
What a rollercoaster this is :P

D-day. Quitting right now.

I tried to quit lurking in this subreddit but failed miserably.
Trying again!
No more lurking so I can get advices and encouragement.
I get stressed at work. Working as a cook in a restaurant.
Craving is at its peak after work. Any advices?
Thanks. Wish me good luck.

Ps. Going cold turkey

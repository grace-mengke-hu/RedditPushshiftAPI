What do you do to relax?

I smoked for a year and 2 months, I quit mid December and to be honest my cravings have been getting worse by the day. I know everyone says it gets easier with time, but it’s been getting harder for me mostly because there’s nothing I can do to relax and chill. I don’t drink, don’t do pills or any form of drugs, smoking was my way of winding down every night. I’d light a cig and listen to music. What have you started to do to relax after you quit smoking?

Help. SOS.

So, i had my last cigarette on Sunday night.. on Monday, I didn't have money on me to buy cigarettes.. counting down the days to pay day.. So it's obviously now Friday, and I've still not bought cigarettes or had a cigarette at all.. I've stopped before, for a month, but I didn't want to, I stopped because I was made to.. I relapsed because I could, because I was able to!

Obviously I understand smoking is disgusting, I know the health problems it causes etc etc, I don't necessarily WANT to smoke with that knowledge, but it's not like I 100% want to stop like right this minute either.. but I've not smoked in like 4 and half days.. I feel like it would just be stupid to walk over to the shop and buy a 20 packet, cause once that's opened and started then I'm back to smoking 10 a day.. which seems a waste of the last 4 and a half days of not smoking?

I could go to the shop right now.. any advice? Thoughts lol? HELP? ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‚

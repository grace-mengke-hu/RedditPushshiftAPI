How do I relearn to write?

So, I'm at nearly a month free and everything is a lovely adventure   full of the smells of baking cookies and freshly cut grass. 


But. 


My biggest smoking trigger is academic writing. I'm a third year university student with what used to be a pack-a-day habit. My usual process to get an assignment done was to buy a pack of cigarettes and a big old bottle of diet coke, sit down and chain smoke while I wrote. It was my absolute all time favourite thing about smoking. 

I'm not sure how much of a mental thing this is, but I haven't been able to do one single assignment since I quit. I can't concentrate. Everything I write is terrible, or I just sit there and stare at essay questions for hours on end.  I have due dates looming and I'm starting to get desperate. 

Does anyone have any suggestions? Help!

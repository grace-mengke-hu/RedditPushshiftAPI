I quit smoking around mid-December.

I was introduced to smoking a year ago, in the beginning of the semester I just happened to stumble upon a rowdy group of friends with more than half of them being smokers and pot heads. Not gonna lie, I started the habit mainly because of how cool and edgy I appeared—I mean, as edgy as any scrawny nineteen-year-old could look. I’d smoke quite regularly and allot most of my allowance on cigarettes. It was more like social smoking at first: my friends and I would chow through a pack in a matter of a few hours over coffee or beer and I found myself never smoking alone. Likewise, the cigarettes I had weren’t even heavy nicotine ones, just light Korean ones I happened to find at 7/11. Dependency on nicotine only occurred to me when I found myself smoking after studying or projects.  

I decided to quit smoking along with breaking off from the (toxic) friend group. After a brutal onslaught of flu-like symptoms, which I inferred was me going through withdrawal, I don’t experience cravings for smoking anymore.

And now after around four months, I still really miss the structure smoking gave to my life. As a university student, I would plow through projects as long as I knew I could smoke some cigarettes afterwards. Or I could drink and smoke after a long, tiring week without seeing my friends. Until now I just realized how much of an efficient reward system cigarettes were for me. And now I’m kinda lost. I just feel like I’m floating by while people around me are functioning properly. I think I need to find another reward system like cigarettes, or else I feel like I’ll pick up the habit again (this time with no friends lol).

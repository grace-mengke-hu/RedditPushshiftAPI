I want to quit!

Hey guys,
first of all, I just write this, because I have to distract myself from thinking about having a smoke and maybe get some encouragement.
I smoke since I'm 17 (now 25), and the last few days I get more and more the feeling, that I have to quit, mostly because of the fear of dying sooner than later. I always smoked a lot, between half a pack and 2 packs a day, so I know it will be difficult.
My last cigarette I had at 09:25 GMT+1 (I know, it is not that long) but I don't really know how to handle the cold turkey.

Just wanted to share with a few strangers, so I would maybe feel guilty if I fail you ^^

wish me luck,
Flakefred

Sneaky sneaky nicotine craving almost got me before I realized it.

79 days in. Four weeks vaping, since then no nicotine at all.

The cravings have mostly not been too bad. Down to one or two a day now, but today's crave was a real doozy. I just fixed a tricky little bug at work, something that would not too long ago have been a trigger to go outside and have a quiet celebratory smoke. But I don't smoke now. Or so I thought.

Except that addiction center in my head still hasn't totally got the message. It had me out of my chair, out of the door and half way to the smoking area before my higher brain kicked in and told me that not only did I not have anything to smoke, but that even if I did I would not want to smoke it anyway.

I turned round and went back to my desk. But I admit I was shaken. I hadn't succumbed to temptation: I hadn't even felt temptation. The ingrained habits just picked me up and started to take me out for a smoke without any conscious thought at all.

Nasty, sneaky, horrible nicotine and your subconscious trickery. I'm onto you now.

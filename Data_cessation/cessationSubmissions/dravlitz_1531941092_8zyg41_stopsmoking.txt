I am 31 and have been smoking for half of my life. I want the pleasure of NOT smoking to be more than the alternative. Seven days smokeless. The Smoke Free app suggested this would be a good support group. So, Hi! I just broke my long relationship with cigarettes. I want to get over it.

I have been trying to quit for more than 2 years, but not really. As you know, it is hard. I spend half of my time working and the other traveling or at some concert or art show. I have many friends who smoke and do not have the healthiest lifestyle. I am used to drinking most days of the week, thus the chances of quitting successfully have been slim. I know I have to stop if I want to live long and continue enjoying the other pleasures of life. This time I am determined to quit for good. Two weeks ago I was relocated for work to a small town with not much “partying” to do and no friends who smoke. I have a lot of time to myself. I have cut down on drinking, my biggest smoking trigger. I’ve had a glass of wine in a week. I am saving so much money!!! Every time I have a big craving I go roller skating or hit the gym. The biggest withdrawal symptoms have been insomnia, excessive phlegm, headaches, and anxiety. Exercise has helped for the insomnia and ibuprofen for headaches. The biggest struggle is not having support. I have kept this private. I don’t want to put off my friends who smoke, I don’t want non smoker’s pity and I don’t want to let anyone down if I relapse. The second struggle is not being social. I have been going straight home from work and avoiding bars and restaurants. At work if I get a craving I can’t leave until it goes away. If I get out the door, I will end up stopping to buy cigarettes. This is hard! It seems I have a long way to go.

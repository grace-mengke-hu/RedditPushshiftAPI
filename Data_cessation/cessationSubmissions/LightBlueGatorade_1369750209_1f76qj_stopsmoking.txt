I quit again today

I tried quitting as of Jan. 1st, and made it about 75 days before getting stressed and breaking the streak. The patches worked well for me last time, so I intend on using them again. I attribute my last failure to going through a lot of schoolwork and work, and writing my MS thesis. Now all that is done, so I am giving it another shot. This time, as added incentive to stick with it, I have a goal for running a half marathon in October, and I am getting back to playing my alto sax, so I need the lung capacity, and endurance. 

Here's to day 1... again!

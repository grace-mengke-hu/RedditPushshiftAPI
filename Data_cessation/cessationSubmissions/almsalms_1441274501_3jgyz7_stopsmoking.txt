Morning headaches

Been 2 weeks now and I've had crappy symptoms here and there- all cleared up by doctors as stuff I have to ride out and I'm okay with that.
However- foggy brain morning headaches- so sluggish! Anyone got a way to deal with these that isn't taking painkillers every morning? I know this can be a symptom of long-term withdrawal.
Thanks!

Day 1 Again after a 11 Day Streak Relapse

Hello everyone. Today is my Day 01 again. I was smoke free for 11 days until a relapse 4 days ago. If I can do it once, I can do it again. This time, I'm quitting forever. No going back, no matter what happens. Last time I relapsed because I relapsed on my NoFap streak and I was feeling heartbroken because of something my girlfriend said. I shouldn't let others control my emotions. Now, My goals are my first priority and ain't nobody is gonna stop me from achieving them. Anyway, wish me luck and all the best to you guys too!

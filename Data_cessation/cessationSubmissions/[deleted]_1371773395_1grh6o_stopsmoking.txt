So... started back up again. And in need of advice.

So I have quit quite a few times in the past. I have tried the gum, quitting cold turkey, and the patch (which was effective until I realized cigarettes really help with stress). Well, I have a job where stress is pretty much an every day thing and I started back smoking to keep myself... sane? 

So I'm trying to quit one more time. I'm not sure about how to manage major stress factors without smoking. Thought you guys might help a girl out?

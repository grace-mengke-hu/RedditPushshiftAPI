$23,725.00

That's an estimate on how much my impulse cost me over 10 years. That's a full-time job for a whole year @ $11.40/hr. 2,080 hours spent working to feed my demon. 253 days of my life spent just inhaling poison.These numbers seem ridiculous, and they continue to become even more ridiculous the longer you put it off.
Don't just stop smoking -

Stop making excuses.

Stop giving in.

Stop being someone you don't want to be.

Stop wasting your time and money.

Stop "Quitting"- and just Quit.

Stop "Trying"- and Do it.

'Whether you believe you can or believe you cannot, you're right.'

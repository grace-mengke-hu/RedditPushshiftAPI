Does the duration you have smoked affect how you experience withdrawal?

This subreddit is really motivating and I am proud to say I am about to have my final cigarette. I started smoking when I started drinking heavily, and that meant two addictions were born at once! Luckily I no longer drink but it has taken me a while to finally decide I'm done with smoking. 
I am 22 (23 in March) and I started smoking during the summer of 2010. So around 3 and a half years I have been an addict...If I'm right, correct me if I'm wrong. I was just curious if your withdrawal symptoms/severity has anything to do with the amount of time you have smoked. I honestly have no idea. My grandpa was able to quit cold turkey after having smoked for his entire life, but sadly I never had the chance to ask him about his experience as he passed away not too long after he quit. I'm not going to assume it is going to be easier or harder for me. I would just like your opinions and/or your withdrawal symptoms and your experience. It could just be that it affects everyone differently. I'm new to all this, and I hope to read your replies when I wake up WITHOUT a cigarette in my hand.

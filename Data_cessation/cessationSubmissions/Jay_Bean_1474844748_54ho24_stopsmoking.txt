I somehow made it through my first day.

Today has been quite a test.  my boss screamed at me for something that wasn't my fault so we got into an argument. Then later,  my boyfriend and I got into a little bit up an argument. Handled all of this stress somehow without smoking a single cigarette or putting any nicotine into my body. idk how I did it but I did. What do you do when you're stressed out and would normally smoke a cigarette? Like when things are so bad you could just cry, what do you do Instead of smoke? also, is the first day or week the worst with it tapering off towards the end? Or does it get harder than this before getting easy? Or is this about how it is period?

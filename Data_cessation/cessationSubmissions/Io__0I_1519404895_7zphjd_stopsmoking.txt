Here goes nothing

I've finally made the decision that my health is just gonna get worse with every cigarette. I wake up with chest pain every morning now. I only hope to have the willpower to stay away for good. I've always scoffed at those that say "a group helps" but since I've  always failed alone I'm gonna give this a shot. Wish me luck guys, as I put out my last smoke.

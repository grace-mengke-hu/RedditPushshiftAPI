doot doot day one

Woke up earlier in the day unable to breathe. I think it's actually due to a potential mold problem at work or ammonia @ home, but I'm using this to get myself to stop smoking. I've tried doing it more than once, longest I made it was ~3 months with smokers mocking me constantly and teasing me with cigs. I really want to be done with this bs.

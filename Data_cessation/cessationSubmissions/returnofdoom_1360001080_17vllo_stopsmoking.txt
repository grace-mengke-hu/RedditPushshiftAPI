Round 2

So yesterday I decided to quit again. I've quit once, and was successful for nine months. Then I made the mistake of thinking I could smoke "only when I drink". That didn't last long. So here I am on my second day... I'm very disoriented and feeling irritable. Plan on going to the gym in a little bit. Wish me luck.

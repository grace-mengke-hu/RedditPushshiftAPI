New Years non smokers...check it!

Well? How we doing you beautiful non smokers? After today, it will be two weeks into this quest...and this weekend, we will be in week 3! Doesn't that feel awesome?

I had a work meeting yesterday at a restaurant. Everyone had drinks. I had diet coke. I was scared to go with alcohol and potentially ignite that trigger. It felt great! I have been alcohol free this year so far. I was actually thinking how long I can keep this up. Can I go full two months? 6 months? Maybe a year? I was thinking today while getting ready for work...why not keep going and keep saying "Let's see how long I can do this for".

My workouts have been better and better. My body is slowly adjusting to lifting weights. Can't wait to get back to where I was 3 years ago...that's when I stopped working out. I been eating clean and trying to keep close to my macros. Lost 3lbs so far this month. I know it's water weight, but it gives me motivation. 

The breathing.. omg the breathing!!! That feeling in your lungs that you get when you take super deep breaths when you smoke...like you can't take a nice clean deep breath... is all gone! I can take full deep breaths now. Feels so good. 

I also cleaned my car out. Vacuumed it, put some leather cream on my seats. Smells so good and fresh now. All the ashes from the back are gone. Threw all of my lighters out. Don't need those things anymore. 

Lastly, I can not believe how much energy I have. It's amazing. 

Hope everyone is still going! This is week 3 people!!!! Coming up!

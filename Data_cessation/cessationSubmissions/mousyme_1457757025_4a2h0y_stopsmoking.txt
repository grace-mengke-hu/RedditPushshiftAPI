My thesis defense is in 18 days, can I quit now?

I have been smoking 7-10 cigarettes for 11.5 years. I am now 30, and I have tried quitting several times, unsuccessfully. I really want to quit again, right now! I am a biologist, I know what it's doing to my health, none of my friends smoke, and I feel so guilty every time I light up. I am seriously stressed out, I am trying to finish writing my thesis, and I am defending in less than 3 weeks. Have any of you quit during stressful times in your life? How did you do this, and what helped you concentrate? I think smoking is just stressing me out more, but I am addicted, and I am worried that I won't be able to concentrate on writing, or my upcoming presentation. I would greatly appreciate any advice you could give me.

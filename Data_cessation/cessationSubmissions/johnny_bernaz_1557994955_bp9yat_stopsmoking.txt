1 month 7 days. No cravings, but shitty mood, stressed out, angry all the time, depressed and pissed off.

Long post, im trying to vent so even if nobody reads this, at least i can put my fucking words on paper, like a diary.

Pretty much title, didnt expect this. I've stopped having cravings a long time ago, like i really dont want or feel the need to smoke at all. 

But im in such a fucking shitty mood all the fucking time. Frowned, angry, stressed, even the slightest minor inconvenience can ruin my fucking day and cause me to burst out swearing the most hateful divine-death-related cuss words you could ever imagine that literally shocks me. I dont want to do anything, dont have the mood for anything. I dont want to work, dont want to hang out with friends or socialize (i've stopped chatting in the fb group for like 2 weeks even though i always used to participate, we send eachother memes and funny videos and whatnot) i dont want to play videogames, dont want to do shit around the house, dont want to engage in any social interactions, my productivity at work is shit and  most likely it's whats making me feel stressed and anxious.

The only thing  that lightens my  mood is working out. When i go to the gym and after(for about 2 hours) i feel good. Unfortunately i cant fucking work out 24/7.

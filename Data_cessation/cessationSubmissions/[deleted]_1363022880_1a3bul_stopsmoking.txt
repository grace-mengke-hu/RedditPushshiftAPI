When does the annoyance stop!?  *Warning Rant!!*

Is it just me, or when you stop with the nicotine, you realize how many people are freaking morons?  Or that alot of them give you really REALLY stupid advice that means nothing and does not help AT ALL!  (Not you guys, you guys have been awesome as a support network!)  And offer their stupid worthless advice even when you do NOT ask for it?  What is with idiotic people offering advice?  Did I ask for your stupid advice?  NO!!!

I am having some issues with stupid, mean, selfish people.  I just have no patience for ignorant, mean-spirted, know-it-all people anymore.  I used to be able to handle these things from those close to me (friends and family), but now, since I quit, I just do NOT want to be around these people!

When does this stop?  I talked to my mom (she quit 1.5 years ago) and she said it was like that for her for 6 months.  Then she started feeling "normal" again.  

I was about to punch a family member today because she was being a snotty little brat!  And the thing I never noticed before is how often she is a mean-spirted little bi**h!!  It is all the time!  This person is so self-centered and egotistical.  She offers her VERY stupid advice to everything anyone says!  And she just overall is not a very good person.  Not someone I want in my life anymore!

I dont know if it is the loss of the nicotine or that I am just getting sick of her sh*t but man, today is hard.

Sorry for the rant, but I had to get it out, it was like poison!  I feel better after getting it out!  Thanks for listening /r/stopsmoking.

PLS HELP R/STOPSMOKING

EDIT: So this was blacked out me last night. The only thing I remember is standing in my driveway next to my car door with my key ready to drive to the gas station to buy smokes....and then turning around and going back inside. I resisted. I didn't smoke even the smallest bit. If I can do it that drunk and that desperate, then I bet all of you can too. Cheers guys!

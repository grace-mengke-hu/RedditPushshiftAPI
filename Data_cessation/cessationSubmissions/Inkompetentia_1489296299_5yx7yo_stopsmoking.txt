Resetting my badge, nipping it in the bud

After 10 years of smoking I quit in September 2015. 2 or 3 times since then (edit: see below), I had cigarettes, almost exclusively when drunk while going out, in the company of smokers - but never more than a handful, never my own, and never without deeply regretting it the next day.

Yesterday was different. I was drunk, yes, but there was no one there smoking. I do not know how I got the idea, but I just wanted to light one up. I went out of my way to buy cigarettes, I stumbled through the street in the cold to buy a pack, heck, I even had to go to the atm to have bills small enough for the vending machine. I was drunk, and I wanted it bad.

It took me the better part of 5 minutes to get the cigarette vending machine to conform to my bidding. It swallowed half of my change, but I did not care - I had acquired what I had coveted.

While I did give a few cigs away, saying "the more i can get rid of, the less I have to smoke myself" I had 10 or so total, 5 in literal succession due to lacking a lighter.

Returning home at 5am, I smoked another 3. Why not? That question didn't even pose itself, it wasautomated, just as it had been for over a decade. I could still taste the ashtray in my mouth, my lungs were hurting, but psychologically, it was as if I had never quit. The same triggers, the same automatisms, the same thoughtless acceptance. 

After waking up today, I wasn't disgusted by it. I smoked the rest of the pack. I considered going out buying another one. More than once. However, I did not. Here I am, taking back control. I am resetting my badge. No excuses, no "it was only this onetime". No bullshit.

For posterity's sake, my badge said 536 days.

edit: It was more than that (exactly 5 times, counting that one time I took a single puff), and I knew it when I wrote that sentence. This is why this needs to stop.

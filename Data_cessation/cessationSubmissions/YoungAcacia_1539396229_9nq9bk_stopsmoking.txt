Not one more puff!

I keep having a streak of about 5 days with no smoking and then I just go buy a pack, smoke a couple, throw the pack away. I want to quit. I understand I can do it.

I think the hard part is over because I no longer experience physical withdrawal when I don't smoke. Sometimes I just stop valuing the number of days I have without a cigarette and go smoke a couple cigarettes.

I want to join this community so that I can have a badge next to my name that tells me how long I have clean and have some pride for the time that I build. I hope that I can update you once I get 30 days and provide some encouragement. Thanks for having this community I see a lot of encouragement here and I hope that I can contribute to this.

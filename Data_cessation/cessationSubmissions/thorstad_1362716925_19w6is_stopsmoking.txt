Nobody has time for that.

I went into a 7-11 today.  I realized in doing so that I haven't been inside a c-store in about...(checks star)...almost 700 days.

'Nothing ever happens good inside a convenience store.  The waits are long regardless of the length, the patrons are stressed.  Why the fuck did I pray in these factories of sadness for almost 20 years?

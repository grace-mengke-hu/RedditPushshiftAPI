Justifications in the face of real threat

In 5 days I undergo a hysterectomy due to precancerous and very early stage cancerous cells in my reproductive organs. 

My doctor was very direct in saying "think of each cigarette as marinating these cancerous cells". Granted, my condition is not directly due to smoking, but it's likely progressed faster than it would have otherwise. 

I told myself "I'll quit 2 weeks before surgery... ok, ten days... One week...." While I've cut down considerably, I'm still smoking at 5 days out. 

There is no true logic to this. Am I stressed? Certainly. Am I addicted? No doubt. Do these points make smoking acceptable? Absolutely not. 

I'm disgusted and annoyed with myself over this, declaring each cigarette to be the last, knowing in my mind that I don't really mean it. 

I wish I'd never started this so many years ago. 

Today really must be the day, or I must accept that smoking is more important than my health, my family, and my quality of life.

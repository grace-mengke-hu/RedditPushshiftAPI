For those of you who just quit, it does get easier.

I'm 19 days away from being smoke free for 4 years. I don't miss it. In fact even though my SO who smokes, I think it's disgusting. I don't miss it while drinking, I don't miss it after a big meal, I don't miss it during work hours, and I don't think about it when I get stressed out.

I can breath.

I can smell EVERYTHING.

I never smell bad. (Except when we take my SO's car, but it could be worse.)

Food Taste delicious.

You can do this, it's not hard. It's easy and it'll be one of the best decisions you've ever made. 

Don't fall off the wagon! You've got this! I know you can do it!

Fuck you, Marlboro.

Smoking for 6 years already. Been at 1 pack a day, now 1 pack for 3 days. Alright. Today is the day. I'm done. I don't want to die in suffering of cancer. How do I do this? I'm at work and we have a break every hour. I can be strong and I won't smoke with my coworkers, but.. How did you guys achieve not smoking on the weekends, when drunk with friends, at the party? 

Please help me save my life.

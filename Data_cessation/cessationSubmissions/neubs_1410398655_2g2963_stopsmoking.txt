I've been smoke-free since I sprained my knee 5 days ago.

After the sprain I decided to stay at my parents' house to heal up and they don't allow smoking in the house.  I'm in my old basement hang-out taking naps and playing old games to distract me.  Even if I did want a smoke it's too much of a hassle to climb up the stairs and go outside.

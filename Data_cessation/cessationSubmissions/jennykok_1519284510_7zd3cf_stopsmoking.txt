Quit for 4 months my friends got me a juul

SO I don't know if this is allowed on this forum but basically, I am really upset at myself and beating myself down over this. I was a smoker for 6 years ( on and off for about 8 months). I started at 14 and am 20 now. I quit four months ago cold turkey and the other week someone found a juul at my job and I took it (i know i am gross but i disinfected the pod but still gross). It was perfect timing as my girlfriend left for New York for four months and I feel sad, alone and lonely. Unfortunately went and got new pods today. 
I feel myself slipping back into my addiction and I hate it. Have smoked a pod now and maybe a bit more. Any words of wisdom? Should I just finish smoking the pods and give up again once this stressful part of my life passes by?

Thinking about going cold turkey, how to deal with withdrawal symptoms during the school day(7 hours)?

I'm 18 and a senior and high school, and have been smoking for about 2 years now. I'm up to a half pack a day and while I don't feel like I "need" a cigarette, I'm definitely addicted I probably just don't realize it. I've decided today that I want to quit, but its also a Sunday and I'm worried about going through the next couple of days at school with likely withdrawal symptoms from cold turkey. How can I manage these during school hours? I'm also honestly scared about how my body will react.

Thank God For Good Friends

I was out drinking on the weekend at a party with some friends, and despite going all of this time and knowing full well that I never want to smoke again, being drunk brought out the inner part of me that craves smoking in social situations. 

I remember constantly asking people who I'd previously smoked around for a cigarette, but thankfully they told me no every time. I vaguely remember telling one of my friends that I'm happy they said no, and now a few days later I'm even happier about it. Who knows what would have happened if I didn't have friends looking out for me.

This experience has brought me back to reality a bit. I may not want to smoke now, but the pathways I have built through years of smoking remain partly intact. I'm glad this close shave has occured though, as it has shown me to be more aware that I'm not out of the battlefield just yet.

Anyway, stay strong guys, let's not smoke today!

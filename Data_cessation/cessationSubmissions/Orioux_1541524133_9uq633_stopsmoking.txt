Relapsed 3 times in 2 months and I feel broken - Please help me

Hey everyone, I apologize in advance for a long post but I feel like I have a lot to say.

&amp;#x200B;

I was smoke-free for 8 months in September of this year and my girlfriend broke up with me. I started chain smoking (pack/day) in some misguided attempt to numb the pain, but instead I was just in pain while simultaneously being an addict. I realized quickly that this was not the way I wanted to deal with the breakup and tried to quit again by rereading that amazing book by Allen Carr. This quit lasted 24 hours before I immediately fell back into my old (prior to breakup) 1/2 pack/day addiction. I continued that way until last Saturday, at which point I had had enough and reread the book again, this time highlighting important points and taking some notes in order to REALLY reflect on the things Allen was talking about. That lasted for 8 days, until I broke yesterday morning due to some stupid stress and started smoking again.

Now, I feel like a fucking failure because I've screwed up the 'Easy' way to quit smoking countless times and I noticed this morning that I have some real sketchy things going on in my mouth (Leukoplakia - white patch beside my tongue at the back and some sore spots on the other side of my mouth beside some other collection of spots which aren't sore) and I'm freaking out because I can't fucking stop and I feel like I have/developing mouth cancer. I'm 22 years old and I am so scared that I'm fucking up my entire future for some false high I can't seem to understand or escape.

I can't seem to eliminate the brainwashing that smoking somehow helps me deal with anxiety and sadness and keep falling into the trap. I need support  and I don't have anyone I can talk to about the personal nightmare that is my life right now so I'm reaching out to the most supportive community I know, the /r/stopsmoking crew. Any advice or guidance on how to truly get rid of this brainwashing and what to do when I basically know 'the book' by heart would be so greatly appreciated.

182 days and going strong !

182 days !

15th july i decided to quit smoking once and for all after 3 failed attempts in 6 years.


I wasnt a heavy smoker i used to smoke on an average 5 cigarettes per day but nicotine is nicotine even if its just one cigarette.


How i stopped :- abruptly ! And all i did was just stick with it its way too difficult in the initial few days but it get easier as the days pass.

How did i handle my craving :- whenever i got craving to smoke i would pretend that i have a cigarette in my hand and do the same actions of smoking believe me the mind gets tricked here... All u need to do is get out of the urge to smoke u can do it by using salt, lemon, chocolates. Its a very short window of 1-2 minute that u need to beat thats it.

To the people who are trying to quit may this post give you a method to quit.

To the people who have successfully quit lets keep on helping our friends and bring a change in their lives.

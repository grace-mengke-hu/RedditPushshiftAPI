Just realized the other day I had passed the 1 year mark and thought I would reiterate some advice I've given before.

I attribute my ability to successfully quit smoking to 2 things and 2 things alone.
1) Set a date far in the future - like at least a month - as the day you are going to quit.  It's too easy to say "I'm going to quit tomorrow" and then continuously push it back, I think we've all fallen into that trap before.
2) Don't tell anyone you're planning on quitting.  This is now something that science has apparently corroborated.  When you tell someone your goals and they praise you for them you immediately become less likely to achieve what you're working towards (http://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_keep_your_goals_to_yourself?language=en).  I didn't tell anyone that I had quit until 2 months in and at that point I was already committed.  

Anyway hope my experience helps and best of luck to all of you, I definitely believe everyone here has the strength to succeed.

Psyching myself out on these withdrawals

Iâ€™m on day 2 smoke free (no NRT either) and for me thatâ€™s a HUGE achievement. For some dumb reason I was thinking that getting through the first 2 days is the hardest since thatâ€™s when the nicotine is leaving your system, but I didnâ€™t even consider that the real withdrawals start when your body doesnâ€™t have anymore. So now I keep psyching myself out thinking everything is about to be unbearable and Iâ€™ve committed too much to relapse and I feel like itâ€™s inevitable and my anxiety is through the roof right now and I think I just need someone to tell me itâ€™s okay or at least give me a heads up on the severity of what Iâ€™m about to encounter in the next few hours ðŸ˜©

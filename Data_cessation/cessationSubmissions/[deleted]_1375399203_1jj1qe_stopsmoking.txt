Kind of trying to quit, but my heart's not quite in it...

I have gone cold turkey for a few days, used electronics for a few days, have had the occasional social cigarette, this has been going on for about a week and a half.  my reasons for not wanting to smoke are that i hate smelling and tasting like it, and I'm also really broke.  

I've been smoking about a half pack a day since last November if you include the electronic cigarettes I started with back then.  Switched over to mainly real cigarettes at some point.

My cravings for the cigarettes are mostly emotional.  I love having something easy to go to that makes me happy howmany-ever-times a day.  I find the stimulating effects of the nicotene to be helpful at work too though.  On cold turkey days I miss it the worst at work for that reason.

I know I could whiz through missing the physical effects of smoking, but the emotional side...nope.  I wasn't prepared for how triggering it would be to set cigarettes aside.  I have lost so much in my life, that facing the loss of my favorite crutch is...sad.  :(  

I am already on an antidepressant that is good for smoking cessation, and the dose is perfect for me in general.  So adding that in isn't an option.  Thinking/taking through my feelings about it doesn't help a whole lot, because the feeling of loss is just raw.  (I'd put it on the level of a ptsd trigger)

Maybe this isn't the right time?  I don't want to smell and taste like smoke and I would like to not be losing money every week.  But I'm not sure where to go with where I'm at on the subject.  I deal with my life so well in general, but I work very hard to do that and stay positive.  I'm generally a ray of fucking sunshine, but it's by choice and conscious effort.  How do I add quitting smoking into that without it being the final straw, as it were?

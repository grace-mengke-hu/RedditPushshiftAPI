My dads need to smoke suddenly dropped after he was sick (flu).

So here's a short story and a question.
My dad smokes since he was 15 or so,now he's 52. Last week he and my brother got flu like symptoms for a couple of days. Vomiting and diarrhea. Probably some bug they got while drinking questionable water,anyway they fine now. But something strange happened. My dad doesn't feel the need to smoke any more, in fact he smoked like 5 cigarets in the last 7 days(he didn't smoke much earlier, a 20 cig pack lasted like for two days). He says it doesn't feel disgusting it just doesn't feel like "good" anymore. Now he's scared that he is "sick" in some crazy way. 
Does anybody know what the hell happened ?

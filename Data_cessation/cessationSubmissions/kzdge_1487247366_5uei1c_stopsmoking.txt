Withdrawal?

Hey guys I haven't smoked for about 4 weeks, so far I've been feeling dizzy, I still feel dizzy and I have got anxiety as part of the withdrawal and I'm always thinking that I would have a cardiac arrest or my brain is stopping to work and I get really anxious, sometimes I panic, does anyone else have this and feel dizzy for so long? And how can I help reduce the anxiety? I'm really paranoid right now about my body that it would stop functioning

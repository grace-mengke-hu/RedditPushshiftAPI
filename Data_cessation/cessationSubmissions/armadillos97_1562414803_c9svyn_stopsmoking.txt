It's been 13 days.

And it's not that bad. I still have pretty bad cravings sometimes. My breathing is better. I'm still broken out. I've gone 10 miles with my dog in just the last 2 days from absolutely barely no walking.

I'm still irritable as hell but I'm trying my best to not take it out on people.

Good morning,  good luck. I wish you well on your quit.

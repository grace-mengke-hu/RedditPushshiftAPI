I'm sick, and I am happy.

Yesterday felt the dreaded tingle in my throat, woke up today with nasty tonsils and feeling generally cruddy, yet I am happy despite this!

Not all that long ago, despite being sick I would have tried to smoke to get my fix, despite how much worse it made me feel, despite how every drag was agony. Every illness I had seemed to end in a chest infection, and I wonder how much that had to do with the cigarettes.

I don't have to worry about that now. Tea, toast, coach and Netflix is all I need. (On rec leave from work, so don't even need to bother calling in sick- ha ha.)

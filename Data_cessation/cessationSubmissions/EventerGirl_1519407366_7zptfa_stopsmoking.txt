First Day

Hey everyone,

So Ive quit before, but Ive always gone back. I am a half pack a day smoker, cut down from a pack a day, and I decided last night after I almost failed my PT test due to not being able to breathe. 

I run three to four times a week and still am slow and horrid at it. I was much better when I didn't smoke. Im just done with it and want to be able to not worry about my PT tests or my weekly runs causing my lungs to feel like they are bleeding. 

So I started last night before my BJJ class at 1734 and have made it till 1232. Im smoking a half now and then will have a half tonight. Hoping to cut that out completely but for now it is what it is. 

Thing is Im surrounded by coworkers who smoke and my roommate smokes and my commute is 45 mins to 1hr each way and Im chewing gum and mints like crazy. I feel anxious and jittery. 

Hopefully this will go well.

I want to thank you all

Started at 17. 1-2 packs a day for over 10 years. Only times I "quit" were the two occasions where I ended up in the hospital and kept for about 2 weeks each time. But then I'd get out and start smoking right back again.

This is really my first attempt, but it's going well. Just over 4 months, but I still come back here and read you every now and then. The support is very nice and helps to keep heading in the good direction. I've put up some weight but that's what I'll be dealing with next.  
  
So yeah, thanks to you all for sharing your stories and offering help and encouragement to others in similar situations. We can all do this and get rid of this shit-poison once and for all!

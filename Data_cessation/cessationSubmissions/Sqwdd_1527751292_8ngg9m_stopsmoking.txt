Do I still deserve my dream girl?

I smoked for about 7 years and quit 2 years ago. Recently I met a wonderful girl, beautiful and smart and we're dating now. 

However, I feel like I'm a ticking time bomb, who knows I'll die before I'm 50 because I just had to smoke and she'll be alone. Sometimes I feel she deserves better. I love her and don't want to hurt her. How can I deal with these negative thoughts?

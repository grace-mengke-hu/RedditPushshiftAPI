Day Six nearly Seven and the flu symptoms have arrived!

I am so proud of what I have achieved so far and was feeling much better. My girlfriend has stopped too and I am even prouder for her. On Wednesday, day 4, I developed an uncontainable cough. I just thought my lungs were clearing but today it's decided to turn into a full blown cold. Eugh! I hate colds!

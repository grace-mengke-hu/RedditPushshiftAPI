Well, that's good I guess?

I made it 45 hours without a cigarette, then last night I stopped at the gas station for a pack after work. I've got a lot of family stress I'm dealing with right now and I caved. I smoked a few before I realized how fucking awful it was making me feel. I was sick to my stomach and my chest feels like a 500 lb man is sitting on it. Now I don't even WANT to smoke. I just have to fight through the urges to kill people for a few days by reminding myself how terrible it makes me feel and I should be good. 

I hope.

Done with the first 3 days. I got this.

The first 3 days were rough. I was able to handle the cravings rather well by just telling myself that it wasn't worth it. That there was no point. But some of the other side effects (mood swings, loss of sleep, the upset stomach) were really getting to me. But today everything feels like its falling into place. I can sleep again (although it's still a little tough to stay asleep) and my body is just used to the poison being gone. Everything is really starting to look up now. Just want to say thank you. This subreddit has been incredibly supportive. I suppose I'll check back in **when** I hit that first month.

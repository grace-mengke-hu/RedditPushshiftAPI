Increased PVCs / arrythmia after quitting?

I'm pretty bummed now and need to vent and get some info from y'all. 

Anyone has increased PVCs/skipped beats/arrythmias after quitting? I've always had them, but it's getting worse now that I quit somehow. 

I'm on day 8 or 9 and I had to go to the ER. Doc says I'm fine all over but I'm getting them more and more over the last few days. 

Today I got so close to just getting back into smoking and postponing my quit, so much anxiety and frustration at getting these episodes again. I told my husband to go buy me cigarettes and gave him my wallet. Of course he got the message and said he was going to go do it "in a bit" as in never. 

Help?

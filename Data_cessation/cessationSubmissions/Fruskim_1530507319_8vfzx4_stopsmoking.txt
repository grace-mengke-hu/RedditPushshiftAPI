Stopped smoking cigarettes a week ago, I feel great.

Picked up the juul around a week / 1.5 weeks can't remember for certain, and ever since I havent touched a single cancer stick.

My sense of smell is back, which is amazing, I can smell stuff now, food  nature, me when I'm taking a shit.

So far my lung capacity is still terrible but I know it'll improve in time. Climbing stairs is a bit easier for me but if I do it too fast I'll get tired super quickly

I'm not a veteran smoker, I started last year in September because I thought to myself "Come on, I won't really get addicted!" and whoop dee doo fucker look where you're at.

Overall I'm super happy, In beginning to get healthier, I'm losing weight too cause I'm on a diet and I don't crave cigs that's to the juul.

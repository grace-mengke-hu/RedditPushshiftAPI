Non smokers of /stopsmoking, how long did it take you to stop coughing after quitting?

I’m at around week four. I noticed my smokers cough disappeared pretty quickly after quitting. But now it seems to be replaced by a deep dry cough that comes out of no where. It’s not all of the time, but I will be sitting down or driving and it just hits me. 
I know it’s the cilia of my lungs regrowing, and I know it takes 1-9 months to recover for most people. I just wanted to know individually how long it took for the dry cough afterwards to completely go away. 
I keep thinking I don’t want to hang out with any of my friends in case this ugly cough hits me out of no where :( 


*some things I’ve noticed since quitting: 

I don’t get winded walking up a flight of stairs or working out. I do breathe a lot better despite the  dry cough 

I get huge random pimples on my face and body. I’ve never had a problem with pimples or acne, even as a teenager

The last chapter of this horror story.

Hooray, my first reddit post is about the crippling self doubt of perseverance! Neat. I'm here to try to stop smoking. I've "quit" before for about 4 months at a time then 6 months at a time until this most recent stint where I've avoided buying a pack and just bummed single smokes from people in attempt to lessen my exposure.  I started when I was 14 taking loosies from my grandmas pack and on and off smoking until now at the tender young age of 22. If anyone has anywhere to begin that would be helpful for long term recovery it'd be appreciated.

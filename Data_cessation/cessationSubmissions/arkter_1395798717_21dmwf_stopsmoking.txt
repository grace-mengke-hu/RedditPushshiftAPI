I fucked up and now I'm paying for it - don't do the same!

I broke up with my partner of many years 2 weeks ago. I spent a week smoking and drinking like crazy. I decided to stop again before I fell back into it too heavily. Well, turns out I already fell into it heavily and now I'm quitting all over again. Crazy withdrawal pangs, constantly at the front of my mind. It was easy to lose sight of the benefits of being a non smoker 2 months after quitting. However, it is easy for me to see the disadvantages going back to it for a week... energy, stench, health, skin, teeth - all disgusting or fucked.

I wish I never had that one cigarette AGAIN because now I'm paying the price and going through hell again.

Don't do the same. It's really very easy to fall back into the trap.

Children of smokers 'risk adult disease'

Parents who smoke are known to have their children at risk of asthma and poor lung development. A study on BBC.com shows that the effects of childhood smoke exposure persist into adulthood, resulting in chronic obstructive lung disease. The researchers focused more on mortality risks, but emphasised that childhood second-hand smoking might also increase chronic illness and health problems later on in life. For any parents-to-be, it should be their responsibility to quit smoking.

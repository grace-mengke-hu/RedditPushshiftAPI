Got wasted and didn't even think about it

It's been 17 days! I had a house warming party for my new apartment this weekend and accidentally got hammered after a few rounds of Mario Party the drinking game. BUT I didn't even think about smoking once. Or if I did I don't remember it which is just as good right?

Right?

Started smoking again after 2 years

I quit smoking 2 years ago after having been a pack (sometimes more) a day guy.  I came down with really bad bronchitis and it pretty much forced me to quit.  After the bronchitis had cleared up, I was worried I would start again but didn't and I felt great up until about 6 months ago.  A lot of stress came into my life and on top of that I also suffer from severe depression and really bad anxiety (always thinking I've got a brain tumor or some other illness.  I know it's the anxiety talking) and for the last week or I've fallen completely off the wagon.  When I first started again I told myself:  2 a day and that is it and it lasted.  Now I'm telling myself: 4 a day.  Next it will be 6 and etc...  I'm trying my best to not think about it but my anxiety is making me crave them.  It puts my mind at ease for some odd reason.  I tried other methods of stress relief and other ways of trying to control my anxiety and nothing works other than cigarettes.  Any advice other than "Go to the doctor" would be appreciated lol.  

For those of you who are wondering, my anxiety is always the worse around the summer time.  I'm extremely self conscious because I am a bit over weight so I always feel people are mocking me when I go out in public when I know they aren't.  This current bout of anxiety started 2 months ago and it won't give me a day's rest.  Smoking seems to calm me down and I wish it didn't.

I just had my last cigarette half an hour ago.

And I mean it this time!  I'm done.  100% done.  No more slip-ups.

Now it's reddit official  :-)

Any tips on handling the cravings?  For me it's always mental, I think smoking will improve my mood but I forget that it's not really much of an improvement and it's always fleeting.  How do you overcome the urge?

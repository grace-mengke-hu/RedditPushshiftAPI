Just a vent on the cold symptoms.

I quit smoking two days ago. Cravings aren't too bad. I was previously addicted to stimulants so the cravings aren't anything new. They're a lot easier to deal with as far as that goes. The mental symptoms feel like stimulant withdrawal. I can deal with those.

But the physical symptoms are harsh as hell. My throat hurts so much and I'm so congested. Lots of coughing up phlegm. Some sneezing. Really lethargic. My head feels so full. I've been taking decongestants and tramadol (prescribed) for my throat, sinuses and ears. Does anyone have any remedies for this? Because this is awful.

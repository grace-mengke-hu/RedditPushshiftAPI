Three days since I smoked, but ADHD meds are testing my resolve today.

I was planning on just lurking here indefinitely, but I figure if I really am serious about quitting I should share. So hello r/stopsmoking, I'm 25 and it's definitely time for me to quit. 

I take Vyvanse five days a week, and for those of you who are unfamiliar with stimulants, they have a tendency to make people really crave a cigarette. I'm hoping there are some of you on here who can relate, but anyone's sage advice is more than welcome. Thanks for reading this!

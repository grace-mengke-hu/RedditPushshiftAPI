You weren't wrong about week 3

So through talking to people on here I have found that many think week 3 is the real tough week.

Those that told me that weren't kidding. Im not even there yet but mentally things are turning to shit. It seems every negetive thing I feel is amplified, Instead of being a little down I feel super depressed, instead of feeling lonely I feel like I'm never going to see anyone ever again. Sadly the reverse isn't true. My positive emotions feel muted, the idea of talking to my girlfriend (who has been away for about a week) barely improves my mood at all. 

I feel like I am locked in a room with no doors or windows. Totally alone in the darkness with no way to know up from down. 

And techincally I have 2 days left till I start week 3.

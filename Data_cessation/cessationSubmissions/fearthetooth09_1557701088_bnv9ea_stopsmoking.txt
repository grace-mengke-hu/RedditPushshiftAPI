Feeling anxious

So I'm about 24+ hours nic free and ivye been more nervous. Obviously we go back to nicotine for a reason and that's because it feels good, stimulates our brain. I know for a fact that more than anything I used it to suppress anxiety in certain situations. Now that I'm trying to rule it out as an option I can already tell my anxiety is heavy today. Hoping it starts to fade as the days pass...

Did You Ever Experience Chest Pains?

I'm 29 and I've been a smoker for about 13 years. I've never really had any ill effects other than being out of breath after activity, but recently I've been noticing some things that have been bugging me.

I had a regular, run of the mill cold a few weeks ago but once the cold went away, all the gunk settled in my chest. For 2 weeks I've been spitting up white mucus and getting pains in my sternum, diaphragm, both sides of chest, and near my collar bones. Did anyone else experience anything like this before they quit? I'm not really coughing, as in, having an urge to couch, more just coughing out of necessity to get the crap up and out.

I feel like I may be ready to finally take the leap.

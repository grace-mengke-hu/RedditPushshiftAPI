5 weeks free!!!

Yesterday marked my 5th week and I can't believe I am doing so well.  I did happen to lose my job a couple days ago and still managed to stay clear.  I guess I can't blame them since I kinda turned into a workaholic but I've always been that way.  Oh well, here's to new beginnings and wonderfully fresh breath and clothes!!!!

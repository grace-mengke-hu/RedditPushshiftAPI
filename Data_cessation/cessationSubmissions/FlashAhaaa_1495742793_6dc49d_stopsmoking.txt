I want to stop smoking but I have some questions...

I've been smoking for a few years and recently I've been wanting to quit or at least cut it down, but I find it really hard. One of the biggest problems for me is that my partner is a regular smoker who smokes about a pack a day. I've tried to cut down my own smoking, but even cutting down is hard because seeing my partner go out for a smoke or lighting one up when we're out together makes my cravings even worse. So I haven't succeeded even in cutting down. So my question is, how do I get myself to quit and overcome cravings when I live with someone who smokes regularly? If anyone here feels my pain and has overcome a similar situation please give me some tips on how to do it!

Many of my friends smoke as well so if I were to quit I don't know how I would be able to handle those situations when I'm somewhere with them. So if I want to quit should I just avoid my smoker friends until my cravings get better or are there some tips and tricks I could try?

I know that if I wanted to quit I'd probably have to use NRT of some sorts. What NRT would you guys recommend, patches or gums etc? 

That's it for now. I'd be very greatful for any advice and support! :)

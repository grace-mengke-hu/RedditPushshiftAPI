To get through cravings during the first few days, remember how hard it was yesterday. Chances are today is a piece of cake in comparison.

This just worked really well for me. 
I'm at day 3 right now and was thinking that the cravings are unbearable, 
but then i remembered how hard it was yesterday. now all i'm thinking is how much easier than yesterday everything is already!

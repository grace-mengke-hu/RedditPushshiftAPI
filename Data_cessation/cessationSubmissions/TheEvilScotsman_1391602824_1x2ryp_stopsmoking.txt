I can't remember how many days it's been now

The problem I've discovered with my previous attempts at quitting were that I counted the time without fags in hours. All the way up to my closest attempt, 137 hours (I think), I was aware of this feature. The problem is it made me very conscious I wasn't smoking and that this was different. 

This time I think I'm on day four or day five, I could find out but it really doesn't matter that much I reckon. I'm just hoping to get through.

I've set myself landmarks, occasions when I used to always smoke. I've done meals and sex, a day of class, a time when all my flatmates were out, I've walked past many pubs. Next I've got to try drinking and going out with my friends who smoke.

Found this subreddit and wrote this post as a way of confirming it to myself, it feels like this is a commitment made to myself and all of you.

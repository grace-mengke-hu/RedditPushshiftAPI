One week of being a non-smoker!

Overall the week was easier than expected. Sure I had the urges here and there. After all, having a cigarette was connected to many parts of my daily routine. But I got through each one of them by reminding myself that I genuinely wanted to be a non-smoker, despite the little voice trying to trick me that "you can have just one" or "just a drag won't hurt".  Nope, I'm happier to say that I don't smoke and won't make that mistake again!

I feel accomplished, I feel positive. The morning cough is already becoming less. My morning workouts are a little easier. Food smells and tastes so much better and I'm no longer throwing money down the drain, or more accurately sending it up in smoke!

(Help) I need your thoughts on something..

*English isn't my first language, if there are any mistakes, I apologize*

So, I've gotten pretty far now. I feel nice and while I really enjoy to being a non-smoker, there's something that bothers me and gets me to a mental state where I'm thinking of smoking again.

What's bugging me is the following: 

When I quit, it was cake. I mean, I barely struggled. So I thought that I wasn't really addicted. Since then I never even touched a cigarette. But lately I want to start again, because I miss it. I miss the whole ritual of smoking. Buying of fresh pack of smokes, and then pack them and smoke them on the balcony on a fresh winter morning. 

But then I think: "You idiot! If you start now you'll be destroying yourself again!"

If I enjoy something, is it destroying me? Is this the same as being addicted? 

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this whole dilemma. 

Thanks in advance!

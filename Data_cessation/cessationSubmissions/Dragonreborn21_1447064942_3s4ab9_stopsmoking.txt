So I'm a little over 3 days in

I started this quit not as an attempt but as a true quit... a way to truly become a new person. I have great backups who aren't smokers so don't know the struggle rooting me on. My only friend has quit today... so I finally have someone to help me... 

I haven't weaned myself. I just quit cold turkey with no nicotine replacement tools...

Gum was my vice for the first day... and went through tons of it...

Candy was my vice for day two... and alL of my kids' gobstoppers from trick or treating is now gone...

Day three I tried to use no vices... that was rough... and I also decided that since I worked with all smokers as a cook... that I needed to be around them on breaks to confirm my quit... I some how made it even though I was offered five times... they think they're so funny... all they were doing was physically hurting me...

It's day four... or night if you will... as I am so restless I can no longer sleep... so I came here...

Is now the wrong time to quit?

23, been a smoker for about 3 years now. I recently put down my last cig and am currently on day 5. The problem is I just started a new job plus am starting a master's program. The withdrawal is hitting hard making it impossible to concentrate on my new job or my course work. Is now the wrong time to quit? I know my addicted side is trying to negotiate here but I can't argue with the fact that it's affecting my ability to start off work and school on the right track.

Stress and the patch

I just quit smoking 2 weeks ago with the aid of the patch. Two questions, has anyone tried the patch before and noticed that it seems like constant nicotine withdrawals are occurring? Iâ€™ve been a smoker for almost 20 years and this is my first quit attempt, so I have no comparison to other quit methods. Also if you could please share your best method on dealing with stress now that the cigarette is no longer a crutch. Thank you!

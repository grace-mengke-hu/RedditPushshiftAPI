This is it, you guys

I quit for three months starting on Halloween and then fell off of the wagon for no reason, really. I just decided to give in to my thoughts.

I had quit cold turkey because I've tried every other method under the sun, pretty much (vaping, nicotine patches, chantix, etc) and nothing had worked.

Recently I've been having some issues with tachycardia, and while doctors believe it might have something to do with hypoglycemia, I have a sneaking suspicion that it is due more to cigarettes than anything. Most episodes have happened after smoking a cigarette, or really overdoing it on the cigarettes (think 5 cigs in an hour).

I know that I need to quit and my planned quit date was Friday but... I had another episode today and didn't go to work (right after smoking my first cig of the day!) and so I think it's time to just knock it off and quit.
I hope that this place will be a haven and huge support to me as I work on leading a smokefree life. From what I've seen so far, you guys are awesome!

Thanks and see you all on the other side :)

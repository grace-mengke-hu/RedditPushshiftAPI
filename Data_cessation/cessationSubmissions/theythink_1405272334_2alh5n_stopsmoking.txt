Hello All. 24 Year old here. 40 a day.

I hope the title sucked you in.

14 days ago, on June 30th I quit smoking 40 a day at 24. Cold turkey.
I swear to you if I can do that, you can do it. It's still fucking hard, but I ain't going back.

40 a fucking day. Fuck that. Look at your packet now and tell it to fuck off.

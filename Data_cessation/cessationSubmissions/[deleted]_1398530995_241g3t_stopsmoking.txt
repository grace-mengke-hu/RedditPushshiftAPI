I need some help guys

my mom and dad have been smoking for 20 years now and I'm really concerned I've tried my best to get them to quit but it takes all my confidence to con front them my mom quit for a year with an electronic cigarette but she started smoking regular cigarettes like e-cigarettes are no good and my dad smokes a pack every two days and every time I ask him he says I can't quit I just enjoy smoking plus he works at a coal mine which produces a lot of dust and smoke and works there every day of the week I honestly think they won't make past 60 I need some help on what to do

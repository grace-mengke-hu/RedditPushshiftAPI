25 months tobacco-free today!

I used to smoke 20 to 30 cigarettes a day. Did so for about 20 years. I finally decided to quit 25 months ago, and haven't touched any form of tobacco ever since.

The first month was awful. Then it got much better. After about 5 months, cravings were 99% gone, as well as any mourning for the lost "pleasure". All those thoughts like "how am I going to live my life without having a smoke ever again" got gradually replaced by "I'm so happy to be free!". I really am.

Nowadays I can't even imagine myself smoking again. I know the danger of a relapse is still there, but it sounds SO undesirable.

I also try really hard not to judge anyone. After all, I did smoke for decades myself -- it would be really hypocritical of me to suddenly become all self-righteous about it now that I've managed to become a nonsmoker. So I try to be kind, respectful and non-patronizing.

Here's wishing you all the best. You CAN do it. Although it certainly is hard at first, it gets much, much easier after a while. Good luck!

made it one week!

I've been smoking for about three years, this is the longest I've gone without smoking in about a year, and I'm feeling really good. I'm just a bit worried, see I'm at home at my parents on my summer holiday right now, so I'm not around the normal smoking environment that caused me to start in the first place. I'm worried that when I get back to Uni I'm going to cave, and I really don't want to do that because I'm actually studying singing and I'm sick of jeopardizing my voice with cigarettes. Does anyone have any tips on how to not smoke in social situations? My flat mate and most of my friends smoke, so it's quite tricky. Thank you, this subreddit has helped me so much already! :)

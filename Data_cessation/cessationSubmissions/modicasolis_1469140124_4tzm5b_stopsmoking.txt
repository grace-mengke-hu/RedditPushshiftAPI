I'm sober and smoke at parties because I don't know what else to do. Help?

I've been sober for about five and a half years now. I have no desire to drink again and can hang out with folks at bars and whatnot just fine. But where I often slip, what's been my downfall every time I've quit and then come back to smoking, is when I'm out at a bar or a party or whatever with friends and people are drinking and I just feel the need to have some vice, some **thing** that makes me feel like a normal person in those settings.

I've tried just using ginger beer or coffee or soda or whatever to replace the act of drinking but it doesn't feel the same. I've had small successes here and there by *smoking* (alcohol and coke were far and away my drug of choice; weeds never been an issue) during parties. But I'm not huge on doing that either.

What do I do?

40 days still craving like mad!

I smoked 15-20 per day for about 15 years, never really attempted to quit before deciding to go cold turkey when I turned 30. It’s been 40 days and I seem to be having a wave of huge cravings these last few days - I wouldn’t even call them cravings as it’s constant. Is this normal?!! Before this I would say the cravings were reducing and becoming more bearable.  Did I go about the quit in the wrong way I.e cold turkey? And when can I expect it to pass? It’s clearly not nicotine withdrawal, so what is causing this after so long? So sorry for rambling - would really appreciate any thoughts or support. To help I am running frequently, I eat well, drink a ton of water, plenty of sleep - I feel as though I am doing everything by the book but just feeling driven up the wall! Thanks gang

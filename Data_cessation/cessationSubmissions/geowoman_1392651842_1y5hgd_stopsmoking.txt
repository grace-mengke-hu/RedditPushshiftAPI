23.5 hours, I almost made it.

Long rant.
On Sunday, I smoked what I though was my last one. Spent the night grinding my teeth and giving myself positive messages. While I was watching tv (and I shit you not) EVERY commercial was about the long term negative effects of smoking. Seriously? Like I don't know them. 
How about a positive one: "Hi, I am Bob. I was a two pack a day smoker for twenty years. I quit. And today I finished my first marathon!"
Why I snapped: I work with idiots. I wake up after having a night of strange dreams to check my texts. Well, one of my co-workers complains that he showed up for day shift when it clearly said night. I send pic of sched, and he fires back with some bullshit. And threatens to take it to the boss. Fucking go for it: He's an idiot that can't read and has no common sense and is blaming me. And I went and got a pack of smokes.
I know: I am punishing my self for someone else's bad behavior. I have some errands to run, I pulling out my Allen Carr and going to drink lots of water today.
Thanks for listening.

Quitting smoking may make you hypothyroid, at least for a little while.

God knows I'm feeling tired.  I'm being medicated for mild, usually asymptomatic hyperthyroid. Doc says yesterday my free T4 (a thyroid hormone) is low.  Maybe I'm over-medicated for the nonce, because of my recent smoking cessation.

Smoking can mask hypothyroid symptoms.   http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/496223_3

 Tobacco smoke is bad for your thyroid.  It's a nasty little feedback loop.

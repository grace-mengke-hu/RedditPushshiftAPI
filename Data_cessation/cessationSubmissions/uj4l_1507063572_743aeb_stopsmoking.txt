Amphetamines Post Quit

Hello all. Day 16 or so and going strong! No physical cravings although I think about cigarettes daily. I was a smoker for 9 years and my max quit time was only a month back in 2012. I feel great right now and have found solace in exercise - yoga, cardio, bball and weight training for my dopamine release.

I've been able to hold my own around other smokers even while we all drink. 

I am however unsure whether I should roll this weekend with a group of friends for a techno show...

Anyone else go through a similar experience whether it be with adderral, vyvanse, MD, etc.? How did you all deal with it?

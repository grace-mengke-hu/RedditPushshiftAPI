3 days

I decided to quit on the 15th of july. It´s not been to bad so far, I don´t have any excessive symptoms (been a smoker for ~9 years) but the cravings are killing me. The closest shop is closed for the evening, which helps.  Also, every time the cravings set in I try to reason myself out of quitting.

Does r/stopsmoking have any tips on how to deal with this?

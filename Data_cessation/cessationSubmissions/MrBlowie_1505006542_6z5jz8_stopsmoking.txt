My Story Should Make You Quit

Hello everyone, I posted a few days ago about quitting since I had a big panic attack and felt really sick. I proceeded to throw away my packet which was brand new and I haven't smoked since.

Okay well this story is pretty sad and shocking yet amazing. A day after I decided to quit my dad calls me through facetime and he looked upset. He then told us that my grandma is dying, they found out she had stage 4 lung cancer which had spread all throughout her body. She is probably now living the rest of her days in hospice care waiting to die.

The news was shocking and everyone was sad. I was just thinking about my dad and how my uncles/ aunts felt. I had never seen my dad cry like this before. And yes my grandma was a smoker for a very long time but she was fine up until now. 

Although I am sad I am very appreciative of this lesson. In my belief I really think smoking my last cigarettes was a sign and I felt a bit of what my grandma was feeling right that moment. It was a very horrible feeling enough to make me say "Fuck this" and throw away my packet with no remorse. Tell me a few months back that I would have thrown away a fresh packet I would not have believed it. 

I hope this encourages you to stop smoking and think about the cost it has on your family not just yourself. Your life has more value than you might think. I saw my dads tears, do you want to see the same?

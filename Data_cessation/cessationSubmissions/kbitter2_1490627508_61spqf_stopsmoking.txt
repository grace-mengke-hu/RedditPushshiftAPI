Day one.... again

Today is day one again. I quit smoking over a year ago after having smoked for almost 20 years. The first month was terrible, but it got easier and I never thought I would smoke again. Then I got stressed and I made an excuse and hear I am again quitting. I remember the cravings and the crabbiness... Then it got easier. I hope this time the cravings and crabbiness will not be as bad because I know I can get through it and it will get much easier. 
This time I am done for life - I hate the way I feel - more tired, short of breath, congestion, the bad taste in my mouth, being a prisoner in my own life. Enough! I can do this and I will.

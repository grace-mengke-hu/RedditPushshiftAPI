Yesterday was so hard...

Yesterday was probably the hardest day I've had not smoking. For the first time since I quit, I had a coffee, drank alcohol and ate sugar. The first two were major triggers as I never did them without a cigarette. Last night while drinking I was all sorts of cranky while keeping myself from smoking. I don't even think I had fun drinking. I think I may have to keep those on the back burner for awhile to continue making progress. Alas, I am glad I got through the night without having a smoke.

I haven't smoked for 51 days, but I don't feel like I quit yet.

Hello quitters.

At the end of August I moved to D.C. with my wife, coming from Mexico. Since I got here I spend 80% of my time with my wife, and I never smoke in front of her which resulted in the last two months of me going smoke free.

I feel great, started running, the wife is proud of me and happy that I don't stink. But I don't really feel like I quit, it kind of feels like a break... like a vacation from smoking. I'm a little bit scared of a trip I have in december in which I won't be with the wife and I might be tempted to smoke. Any recommendations?

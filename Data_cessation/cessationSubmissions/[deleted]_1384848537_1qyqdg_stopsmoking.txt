My hair is growing back!

Hey guys! I'm so glad I found this community. So I'm an 18 year old Freshman, and I gave up smoking about a week or two ago(I don't like counting the days it makes it seem daunting.) I'd been smoking since I was 16, but *sparingly.* With the stress of a college, and no one there to tell me no, I started smoking more and more. Get drunk? Have a couple smokes. Eat a meal? Have a couple smokes. You get the picture. Anyway, I was going through about 3-4 packs a week.

 I got a pretty big haircut a few weeks ago, and I was really freaked out! My hairline receded pretty far back, like what looks normal for a late twenties early thirties year old. Now I had a completely full head of hair a couple months prior to that. My hair was also extremely thinned out on the temples, and somewhat at my new widows peak. My dad went bald pretty young, he was sporting a combover when he graduated(at 26, he was an engineering major and took a couple years off, the stress of that probably made him go bald lol.) Also my grandpa on my mom's side went bald very slowly.

So anyways I was stressin pretty hard about this. But I noticed something positive! The areas that were getting thinned out are filling back in a little bit! It isn't much, but I definitely notice something! Maybe this is just a placebo, but I've heard that smoking has aging effects, and I've also been working out more lately(anti-aging effects I guess?) So maybe, I'm crazy, but if I'm not, you guys out there have another reason to not light up.

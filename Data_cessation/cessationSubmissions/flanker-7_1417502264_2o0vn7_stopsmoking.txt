I need help

anyone know any good hobbies to do with free time? I find it harder and harder to resist. I'm usually pretty busy since I quit with sports and studies, but I have free time now and I can't bring myself to throw away the pack of cigarettes I bought back in October. Any advice?

Edit: SO convinced me to toss away the cigarettes, was a rough night but I actually feel so much better knowing that the temptation is on its way to the dump!

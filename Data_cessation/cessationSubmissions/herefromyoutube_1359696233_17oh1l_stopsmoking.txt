[question] recently I started rolling my own ciggerettes but even with that I noticed cravings for a regular ciggerettes, any ideas why?

I understanding this is a stop smoking reddit but I am currently trying to change things up. I would like to quit and am planning on it but I currently am not ready. 
I honestly think I'm more addicted to the activity than the nicotine. After this, before that, driving, waking up, coffee, beer....


Anyways, I started rolling my own. I see it as a way to cut back because having to roll one makes me wonder if I truly need it. However, I notice a craving for an actual cigg and was wondering if it's because there are other things in them? or if I'm just crazy and it's all in my head.

I've also tried welbutrin(is 75mg even enough, btw?) and E ciggerettes to no avail. I figure cutting back is a good first step and rolling will help me do that.

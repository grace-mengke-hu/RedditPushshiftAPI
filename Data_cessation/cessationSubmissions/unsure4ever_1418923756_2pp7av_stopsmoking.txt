I am unable to find the strength to quit.

It has been 8 Years since I started smoking. It started when I was in college, trying to look cool. 

8 years. Luckily I was never smoking packs... Five a day was my Max. I tried quitting a lot of times. The best I could do was 3 months. But I could never break free completely. Kept coming back to it because of depression and stress... 

I hate having this weakness. I hate the nausea that I get when I smoke one too many. I hate the headaches when I don't smoke for a day. I hate the asthma that comes to me when I smoke and which leaves me when I quit. I hate the loss of appetite. But I still keep smoking.

Now my parents are old and depend on me. I am a weak nerd. Have always been weak since I was a kid. I need strength to take care of myself and to take care of them. I need to be strong in mind and body. But I have a weakness that I am unable to beat. Because of the smoking and the asthma I am unable to hit the gym. Unable to feel strong. 

I want to quit. I will keep trying to quit. But this series of endless relapses is making me sad and desperate. 

I need the strength to quit...

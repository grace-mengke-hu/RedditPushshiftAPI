Want to quit for good

I quit since 5 days and it feels great! 
My problem is, I have done that a number of times, quiting for a few days, weeks, months even once I made it more than 2 years. Each time I do it it feels great, healthy, I love sport btw, and all that. But for some reason I always go back to smoking. I believe that I am out of it, that I love being a non smoker and that I don't need to forbid myself a little smoke, especially because this happens usually on parties, with friends, passive-smoking-anyway-so-why-should-I-struggle, but the truth is, I just totally love it with a good bier, the appetite ist still there if not the addiction, and that's how I end up smoking again 1/2 pack or even a whole pack a day. Same story repeating over and over since about 15 years. I read Allen Carr's book, I totally relate to what he explains, how this happens, but it did not help so far to avoid the traps. To kill for good that "Nicotine Monster" in me. 
Now I am getting father in 2-3 months. And I feel it may now give me the force to do it. Forever. I want to.

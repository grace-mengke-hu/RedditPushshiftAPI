Bought smokes for a friend...

And I didn't have one! It felt so bizzare buying them but not intending on smoking them... I have been without a smoke for 55 days and the cravings have been really strong lately due to stress I think but I imagine how sad I would be after I had that one stupid cigarette in comparison to how I would feel after just waiting for the craving to pass (takes about 5-10 minutes!) and I just try to forget about it.

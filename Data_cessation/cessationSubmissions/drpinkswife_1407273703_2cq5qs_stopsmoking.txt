Nightmares

I kept dreaming I failed. I failed at quitting. I failed at running. I failed in my relationships. I just plain failed. I kept waking up, feeling like crap and then having the same themed dreams again. 

So when I finally woke up and it was light out, my first thought was *I will not fail today*,  got up, and went for a run. Then I went to work. I never wanted to smoke today. 

I don't know what those dreams were about. They seem to come out of nowhere. 

More than Â£200 saved. Another day done. :)

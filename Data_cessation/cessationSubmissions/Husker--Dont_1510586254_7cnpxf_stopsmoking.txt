One year today, been having cravings lately

Today marks my one year since I quit cold turkey, and I couldnt be happier. I feel fantastic physically, and it was one of the best decisions of my life. 

The past couple weeks Ive been having cravings every couple days and its been very strange. I know Ill stick through it, but it is a big reminder to never let your guard down. 

Good luck to everyone else out there. Its definitely not easy, but it is well worth the effort! 

Does anyone have experiences with cravings this far along? Id like to hear from others.

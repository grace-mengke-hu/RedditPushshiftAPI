Need to stop smoking. Please Help.

Hey guys. I'm new here. I'm a 14 yr old boy from Philippines and I'm becoming addicted to smoking. I started smoking when I was in grade 8. I almost smoked everyday then i stopped in our school break which is about 10 months. Now I'm currently i grade 9. I smoked everyday because of my classmates. Now I want to stop but stopping for 1 day makes me go very itchy to smoke. I want to stop because I'm very disgusted about myself and I'm to young for this shit. Theirs a friend of mine and she is the reason i want to quit smoking. She is the reason why I'm here in Reddit asking for help. I want to quit permanently. Please give me tips and tricks on how to quit smoking.

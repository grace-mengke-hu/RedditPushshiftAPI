4Months Down and Craving

Hi all,

You may recognize me from a post I made last month (at the 100 day mark) about how easy I found it to quit but here I am, just under a month later and I am craving so bad.

I had a long weekend from work that I spent with friends and family and I came into the office this morning to be yelled and sworn at within 15 minutes of unlocking the door. Then I deal with two more customers that both equally treat me like shit as well.

I am craving so bad right now. I'm on the verge of breaking something or tears and I'm normally not like this at all. I have anger problems but my anti-anxiety meds help with it quite a bit (and by that, I mean my anger problems are non-existant now) but right now I'm just so upset and pissed and right now I JUST WANT TO SMOKE AND CRY AND SLAM STUFF.

I can feel that just by typing this is helping with the crying and breaking stuff but I still want a smoke and that's not just from today, it's a craving that has been creeping up on me for about a week and it's getting harder and harder to fight everyday.

Tips? Advice? Funny jokes?

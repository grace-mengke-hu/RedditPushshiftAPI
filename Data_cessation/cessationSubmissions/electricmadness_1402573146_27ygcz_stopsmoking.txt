How I ended cravings and conditioned myself to be disgusted by cigarettes

pros: i successfully quit and no longer get cravings. cons: it was expensive, took a full year to completely stop smoking, it was hard work.


I haven't had a single cigarette since Jan 7, 2014. I smoked a pack a day for 8 years. 

My method: 

1. CARDIO: do at least 30-60mins of cardio per day, 5-6 days a week. this is brutal at first, you will run out of breath and feel like you're about to collapse. just take a 5min break and get back at it. hard cardio made my lungs hurt for the rest of the day, and naturally reduced my cravings

1. b) (This is optional) STRENGTH TRAINING: I joined a gym and started lifting weights and eating healthy. Once you start living healthy your inclination to smoke cigarettes drops significantly.

2. DEVELOP A TASTE FOR FINE TOBACCOS (pipe/cigar): everytime you want a smoke, light the pipe or cigar and DON'T INHALE!!!! not inhaling is key. Learn to enjoy them. The idea is once you start eating steaks, you just don't really want hot dogs anymore. LEARN to ENJOY fine tobaccos. You'll have to Do some research. At first you will be grossed out by both pipe tobacco and cigars, and You will be tempted to inhale but you start getting  a hang of it and you start enjoying them after a while. I started with a pipe, and then moved on to cigars. I still occasionally smoke cigars, but I am literally disgusted by second hand cigarette smoke; I even tried a couple of puffs of a cigarette the other and found it quite nasty. 



I hope this is helpful. I'd be happy to provide details on my current/previous lifestyles or the transitional period or answer any questions if there is any interest. My method above is mostly a summary. 

Good luck quitting!!

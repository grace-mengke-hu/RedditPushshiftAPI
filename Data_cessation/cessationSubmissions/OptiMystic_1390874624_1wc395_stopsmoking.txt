First time I actually want to quit

Hey everyone. I don't have much to say, but I feel I should talk to some people who know what I'm going though. So as of 12 last night (20 hours ago) I have quit smoking. I've tried to quit in the past, but to be honest they were pretty half hearted attempts. I would convince myself that only having 1-3 smokes in a day was great and eventually I would make it down to 0, then I would quickly find myself back at the old level of smoking. Recently I found that my throat is beginning to feel sore more often, I cough quite a bit, and I just can't run or play basketball the same way I used to. And I'm only 22!

So I tried taking zyban last week, only to find out I reacted to it pretty terribly. I was foggy headed, constantly tired but still awake, and it felt like someone constantly had their hand on my throat. I quickly stopped taking that, but decided to still quit the same day had I still stayed on it. So here I am trying to quit cold turkey and I have honestly never had such bad cravings, even though I still know that I don't want to smoke anymore. I think tomorrow's going to be my hardest day since I'm at school for 4 1/2 hours and many of my triggers are there, but I believe I'm up for the challenge.

Well that's about all I have to say for an introduction.

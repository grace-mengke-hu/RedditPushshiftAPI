Losing all hope in myself..

Third time I’m posting here. I feel like this addiction has a real tight grip on me. I see everyone here passing day after day and I can’t even keep up for one day.

I wanna quit so bad! Hate the smell, the taste and what it’s doing with my health and wallet. But when I try quitting it goes well for a little while (not a whole day) before my smokers brain completely takes over. 

I live with a smoker that isn’t ready to quit yet. I think he doesn’t really want too either to be honest. In his mind he enjoy smoking. He does support me though. 

Everyone close to me smokes. Parents, best friend, boyfriend and so on. 

Failing over and over is making me really depressed. I know the only thing that helps is to just not smoke but when my smokers brain takes over it takes over my whole mind and I can’t stop it. Especially hard when there is cigarettes around here. 

I know all the benefits of quitting but still I’m struggling so much.. this sure is a horrible addiction. 

I don’t know what I want out of this post. Just needed to get it off my chest to someone because nobody around me understand me. They’re basically happy smokers in their minds. 

Does anyone have any tips for when the mind games takes over? That’s my biggest challenge.. I come up with all kinds of reason for smoking when I start struggling.

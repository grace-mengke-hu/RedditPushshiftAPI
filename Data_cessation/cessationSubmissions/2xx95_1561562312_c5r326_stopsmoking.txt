I'm going into the woods to camp alone for the first four days of my quit.

I've quit dozens of times, once for as long as three months, always to come back to this horrible addiction. One of the biggest obstacles for me in deciding to quit is waiting for the "right" time. A time without responsibilities, without people I'll end up snapping at, etc. That time will simply never come, so I created it. 

No excuses this time. I'm really really fucking ready. I smoke a pack a day, and I'm spending upwards of 200 dollars a month on this shit. It has to stop. I can feel how it affects my body. I want this in my past. 

Tonight I'll leave to go camping in the smoky mountains. I'm going to listen to carr (again) on the way there, then totally unplug for four days and just be with myself. I'll update when I return!

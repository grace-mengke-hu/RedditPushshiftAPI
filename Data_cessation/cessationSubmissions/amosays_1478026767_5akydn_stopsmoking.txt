Day One, 16 hours nicotine free

I have tried many many times to quit. Most recently I have been trying since April (when I hit the 10 year mark of smoking) and have been rather unsuccessful. But I am tired of smoking, I never pictured myself being a lifetime smoker and I always have made excuses for myself (just through college, just through grad school, just until I'm 30, etc.) 

I think I have finally come to a point where I am realizing that at some point I just have to STOP. It doesn't matter what stressful event is coming up, or that I am around friends who smoke, or whatever lame excuse I can find. If I want to be a nonsmoker, it means stopping. Completely. Today. I am trying to stay strong. I haven't smoked one since about 10 pm last night. The cravings haven't been too bad yet. I am definitely thinking about smoking, but am trying to make myself feel disgusted by it. 

I think the struggle is going to be when I get home, my SO is still smoking (also wants to quit, but I think it will take me committing before he actually does). My downfall is always the mentality of "I'll just have one, going from 15 a day to 1 a day is a great improvement...." but before I know it, I am back at 15 a day.

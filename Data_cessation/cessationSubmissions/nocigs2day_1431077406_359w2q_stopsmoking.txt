Why don't I feel great about this?

Think I'm asking for a bit of help.
Dont get me wrong I'm glad I'm not a smoker and even though I think about smoking it feels like I've got passed the worst. What is wrong with me?
If your new to quitting stick with it don't let me put you off I feel miles better than when I smoked but I've always been a bit of a miserable git!

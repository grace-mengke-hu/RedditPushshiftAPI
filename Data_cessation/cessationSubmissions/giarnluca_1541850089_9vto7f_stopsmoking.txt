Black specks

Hey everyone! This is my frist ever reddit post. Though i have been lurking this sub for a couple months (since i quit). Im 23, been smoking tobacco and weed/hash since 18. (mostly mixed)
Right before i finally quit, i started cutting down, following notcing these dark/grey specks in my phlegm when i coughed. I've been more or less smoke free for two months now (two joints for 2 months). The thing is i sometimes still get the Black ish specks in my phlegm, not as often as before tho. Some days i can cough and hack up shit all day without any of these specks, on other occasions one light cough is enough to spit out almost record amounts.

Anyone else have this, and also for this long period. (2months +)?
Thanks for pooping my cherry stopsmoking.

just smoked a butt

i had a few drinks and i wanted to make my self disgusted with smoking so i wouldn't crave cigarettes i quit a few months ago but my family still smokes any way a wanted to write down that it tasted like shit my head is pounding and my body and mind hate me. tobacco is not worth the money,time and health please future self (never do anything like this again you dumb ass) i even flicked a coin and it came up the tails (meaning don't smoke a butt) and i still did it, i failed but i will get stronger i will never give up. I'm not disgusted with smoking I'm disgusted with myself thanks.

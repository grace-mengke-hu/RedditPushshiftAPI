How long did you take Chantix for?

A year or more ago I took Chantix and after 4 - 6 weeks thought I was fine and stopped. The urge to smoke was intense and I started smoking again.

I've started Chantix again. I'm thinking about taking it for six months or longer this time to make sure that I am able to stop smoking.

I have Crohn's Disease and I really need to stop.

Please let me know how long you took it, and if you're still nicotine free.

10 Days smoke-free thanks to Champix!

So I started taking champix (chantix in the US) 17 days ago and quit smoking 7 days in when I just didn't feel like smoking anymore, they tasted weird and weren't doing anything. Chamoix is seriously a wonder drug. I realised earlier today that I hadn't even thought about smoking at all in the last 5 days or so. For anyone struggling I highly recommend it. I haven't had any crazy dreams or any other side effects and feeling way healthier already (I am also 40 days sober from alcohol addiction too).

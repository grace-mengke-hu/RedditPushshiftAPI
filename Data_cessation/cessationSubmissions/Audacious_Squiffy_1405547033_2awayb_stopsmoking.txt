Been smoke free for a month and my breath is terrible. What gives?

I brush twice a day and use mouthwash, although lately I've been brushing more than that because I just can't stand the taste in my mouth. My breath wasn't like this before I quit smoking. I just can't stand it! Has this happened to anyone else?

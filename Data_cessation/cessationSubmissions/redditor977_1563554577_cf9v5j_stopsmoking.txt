I'd been expecting the results of some EXTREMELY important blood tests for the past 3 days

I'd never been so anxious in my life, like ever. All I could think of was a pack of smokes that would keep me busy. I did not give in! The results came in today and they're perfect! I'm so glad I did not relapse and it's all thanks to this sub. Thank you guys for being here! It's day 47 today and I love you all. Please keep going, you are so strong!

Day 5 and I did not kill someone!

I got a new tattoo yesterday and inbetween the break the cravings got soo bad people started to ask me if I was oke. I texted my friend that he earned 60euro's (We have a bet) beceause I was getting some cigs. He called me and wuzz like "SAY FKING WHOT M8?!" and I cooled down and decided to get another tattoo.

Now I'm really glad I didn't smoke.

Appetite through the roof, atmosphere, and beyond

I have been off tobacco for about a month now (using 4 mg lozenges between maybe 1-3 times a day) and the worst of the physical withdrawal is over. I no longer want to murder anything that moves. I suppose that counts for something. 

What I was wondering is how long will I perpetually feel like eating anything I can get my hands on? I know nicotine kills appetite and boosts metabolism; I am not trying to figure out the why. But did my stomach suddenly turn into a bottomless pit because increase in appetite is a withdrawal symptom, or is it because that is how appetites normally are in non-smokers? What can I do to stop looking longingly at even my own arm in hopes of finding savory flavor?

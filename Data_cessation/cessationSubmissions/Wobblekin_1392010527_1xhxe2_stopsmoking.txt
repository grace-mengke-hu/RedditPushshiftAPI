What I find hardest so far (7 days)

I'm finding it difficult to remember that I can be happy without them. I'm generally pissed off and kind of a bummer. I'm an Eeyore at the moment. It's stupid and makes me feel dumb that I ever got myself in this situation to begin with. 

Update: I ate a gram of psilocybin mushrooms last night (first time in 10 years) and I think it really helped reset my frame of mind. Feeling great today :)

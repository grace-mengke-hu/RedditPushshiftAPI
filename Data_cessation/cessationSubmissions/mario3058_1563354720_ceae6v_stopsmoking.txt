List of things i have noticed since i have quit smoking

1 I can breathe so much better and it's so nice

2 I sleep so much better no waking up in the middle of the night a million times. soo nice 

3 my anxiety is gone no more panic attacks.  thank god best thing that's come out of this

4 I can focus better. think that's got something to do with my anxiety  being gone 

5 got so much more energy feels good :)

and so much more little things (I am 26 male and on day 8 )  don't know why you need to know that but thought it would give you a better understanding of me lol :)  wish everyone the best of luck

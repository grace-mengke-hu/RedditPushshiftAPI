Welp, cigarettes just messed up a date...

So today was my third day without smoking, until a few hours ago... 

I was hanging out with a girl I'm interested in and things end up going to the bedroom. But I can't concentrate, my mind is filled with cigarettes. I wasn't able to perform... I was weak and bought another pack on my way home.

I just threw that pack away, what a waste of money. But I'm not gonna let cigarettes get in the way of my life again. I'm super done with them!

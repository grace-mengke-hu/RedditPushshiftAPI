Wish Me Luck

I'm going to a cardiologist today. I'm not expecting much. I did use some of my non-smoking money to buy myself a First Class train ticket. I'm trying to stay positive. Here goes nothing...and it is what it is...and either way, I will not smoke.  

Edit: So the specialist is sending me to a more special specialist. And they are going to do more tests. They don't want to admit me to hospital and haven't taken me off work (but work may, if I don't do 12 hour shifts), so I'm going to go with this is good news. And I'm not going to smoke. I totally forgot to ask if I can travel. Fuck.

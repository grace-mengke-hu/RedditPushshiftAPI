Five days down, again! Here's my story.

In an hour I will have done five full days with no nicotine.

This time around I'm doing it cold turkey. I've got chewing gum for the oral fixation, and fruit and shelled pistachios to munch on. The pistachios were the healthiest but I could find, and being shelled means I have to de-shell them one by one without shoving half a bag in my mouth.

A few weeks ago I used this method and also managed to make it to my fifth day. Unfortunately I returned home from work and found cheating messages on my (now ex) partner's phone, kicked him out, and decided to have a bit of a bender and got very drunk and smoked lots over the weekend, as one last crazy spell. I'm now back on day five and feeling so much better. He wasn't willing to quit so I would have been in a smoke-filled house while trying to better my health. So now, I have no excuses!

"What if...?"

This is my third attempt day two. Last time I quit I was really confident. It's a matter of necessity; being confronted with the health issues is all too real. 

People think they are above smoking but even if you can quit, you are not above your body. Don't expect your body to like smoking and don't expect your body to encourage you to quit. It something you have to know. If you keep craving and something keeps gnawing, that is the price you pay. That is your brain throwing rotten tomatoes at you because you suck and you get boo'd off stage. That's what you have to take for granted for giving up on your addiction; it's a crowd that expects your routine performance and suddenly you change the act.

Face it and be proud. Feel it. Quitting is only real.

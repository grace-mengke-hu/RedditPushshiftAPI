I need to get serious about this.... How do I setup my "badge?"

Here I am.  Said yesterday was the last.  I made it about 20 hours till I succumbed to my craving.  I'm using the Smoke Free app and am wanting to see those numbers go into days and what not.  I feel like maybe I'll be more accountable with this community.  I want to proudly go through the days on my badge, etc.  sorry for the noob question.  I am a Reddit noob.  

Thanks again to all who have replied in my previous post.  There were some really great ideas.  I think I'm at the anger phase where I am just pissed and fed up with this addiction.

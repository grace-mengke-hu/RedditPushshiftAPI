Am I a closet smoker? Only smoke when I am alone / outside my home. Any suggestions to quit this habit for good?

I don’t smoke at home. I can go days without smoking as long as I am home with the family. I don’t smoke once I’m back home from work until the next day morning.
 
It always makes me think I’m not hooked to it and I can quit easily. Looking back I have been doing this on and off for almost 7 years now. 

My urges surge as soon I leave to work, go on a drive or on a trip? Trips abroad are the worst .. 

I keep discarding brand new boxes of cigarettes thinking I’m done and then I go get one more.

What has helped folks like me quit it for good?

Quitting and Mental Health

Hey there, I'm very new to this sub and I apologize if this has been asked and answered already. 

I'm 32 years old and I've been smoking for I think 13 years or so. I've never actually attempted to quit before, but it's starting to occupy my mind more and more. I know this is something I really need to do, and I understand that I also have to really *want* it, and that want is growing day by day. 

I was recently diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and I've just started taking medication for this. It will take some time to kick in, but I'm reaching out to you guys wondering if anyone has dealt with the same diagnosis and has found that quitting smoking helped at all with those feelings. 

I imagine it will be hard for me to discern whether it's just the medication helping me or if quitting actually adds to specifically feeling better mentally, so I guess I'm asking for feedback from those who have dealt with depression/anxiety and have quit smoking before taking medication. 

Any insight into this is very appreciated!! 

Thanks yall and good luck :)

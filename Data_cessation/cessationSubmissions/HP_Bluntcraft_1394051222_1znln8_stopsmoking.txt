Day #2!

Well, I've decided to change up a lot of my unhealthy habits. I've been getting fat from drinking too much and I'm constantly winded from about 4 years of super heavy smoking. I didn't smoke a cigarette yesterday, and I'm gonna stick with that today. Anybody want to give me words of encouragement?

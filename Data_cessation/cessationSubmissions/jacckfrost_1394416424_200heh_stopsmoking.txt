Trying to quit? Don't buy a pack, bum a smoke instead

We all get the urge to smoke one after we've quit and boy does it suck to buy a whole pack when u just need a few drags. Now that u got a pack, you will probably smoke them all and get hooked all over again. 

Instead of buying a pack, walk over to the nearest Joe puffing away and offer them a dollar and say hey bud, I'm trying to quit so can I buy a smoke from you instead? They will more than likely understand and appreciate ur efforts. On the bright side u can get ur fix without having to buy a pack. It's a win win situation. 

Ofcourse don't make this a habit. 

Edit: as expected, it's been down voted. It doesn't matter. Know that the  joe will be there for you in case required and you don't need to buy a whole pack.

The only way to stop smoking is not to smoke.

Not even counting how many times I've promised myself not to smoke again. That I'll quit. "Just one more pack and then I'll stop", "I won't buy more", "Tomorrow is the D-day". All the times I was thinking "holy shit can't catch my breath", "oh that yellowish/dark brown tint on my teeth and fingertips looks amazing, imagine the lungs", "is that pulse really supposed to be that high?", "wonder what this food taste like".

I've throw away cigarettes and lighters only to stock up again in hours time. I promise myself not to buy another pack only to stop in the shop and buy two. I know it stinks as hell, it's really fucking bad bad bad bad for me, I feel the cigarettes slowly killing me. And when I manage to quit for few days, then there it is. That silent voice of "hey, you got this! why not have a one just to see?"

I had quits that ranged from hours, days and even some months. But always I've started again. I've always found some excuse to have that first smoke. "Just to taste", "Relieve withdrawal" and the best one ever "I FUCKIN' DESERVE MY CIGARETTE!"

I've felt again and again into that shithole of addiction and slow self destruction and self poisoning.

Fuck. That. Shit.

Now on to yet another try. I got all the tools I need, I know about withdrawal, I know about the anger that will come and hopefully thanks to my last relapse and the ones before that, I can see it more clearly now that it's always that first fuckin cigarette.

So here's to the oxygen high of next few days for me and fuck that first smoke!

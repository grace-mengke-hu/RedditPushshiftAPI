Is ecig still considered smoking?

I started using ecig back in July and stopped smoking for almost two months. The reason I got back to smoking analog was because of life challenges and other matters.


Last Friday, I smoked my last analog cig, but kept using my eCig with various flavours and nicotine levels.


Cheers

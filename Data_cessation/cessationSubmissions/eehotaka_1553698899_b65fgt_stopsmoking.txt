Strange trigger (resisting it though)

So I stopped smoking and vaping nearly 10 weeks ago, I had given up smoking in early November. For many many years my wife and I had a don't ask don't tell agreement, I never smoked around her, she never asked about it. What that meant, though, was I always found excuses to get out of the house for a short but, either to a store or, more often, walking the dog. Of course the dog really don't care to be walked as much as I needed home to be, whatever.

With winter, and without the need to go out for a smoke constantly, the dog hasn't been walked nearly as much, in fact hardly at all. Asshole plow drivers push the snow right across sidewalks in my neighborhood, walking is too much of a PITA.

Spring is coming, though, and we've been getting out more often. And with our walks comes... Cravings? Thought after 10 weeks I'd be over them, but they're still there. I haven't, not will I, give in, but I'm kind of hoping I do. See, I have the last three cigarettes from the pack when I quit smoking, I keep them as a talisman. They're non filter, and they're nearly 6 months stale, I can only imagine how bad they taste. 

But I won't. My will is strong, and I'm very happy with the fitness progress I've made (from couch to 10k in a couple months, I also swim 1500+ yards twice a week). I just find it odd that something so benign can cause a reaction this far in.

Stay strong all.

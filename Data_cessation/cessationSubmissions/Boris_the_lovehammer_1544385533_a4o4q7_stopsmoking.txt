2 months no nicotine, finals week

I quit about 3 months ago and after week 2 it was pretty smooth sailing until this week. I have finals starting tommrow and I have been studying constantly this past week. Iâ€™m not sure what it is about studying for long periods of time but it makes me crave nicotine something fierce. 

Any tips on how to stay focused on studying while getting bad cravings?

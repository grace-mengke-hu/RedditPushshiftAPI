Almost 2 years removed ... still craving

Hey everyone. I quit smoking on August 14th, 2011. I'll never forget that night. I smoked the last cigarette in the pack at around 10:30 p.m. and told myself that was it. After 7 years of smoking a pack a day, I quit. I went cold turkey and never looked back ... sorta.

Coming up on my two year anniversary now and I still get an urge for a cigarette every once in a while. I've never given in obviously, but about once a month I just start really craving a ciagarette. Is this normal? Does this ever go away? I think I could pick up smoking again tomorrow if I didn't have a little self control. I was just wondering if anyone else still struggles with those small cravings this far removed.

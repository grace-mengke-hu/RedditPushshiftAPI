Having a real tough time getting back on the wagon

Hi everyone. So earlier this year (Jan) I quit smoking cold turkey. I was feeling great and barely ever thinking of taking another puff, I hung out with my friends (Including those that smoked) and didn't have one so things were going great. 

On day 140 (about a month or so ago) my mother (whom I am very close with) dropped a bombshell on me over a health issue she was suspected of having. My first thought was I need a smoke, now like many people I am a stress smoker, it is my thought that since I started in my mid teens (when you develop coping mechanisims for dealing with stress) I learned to use smoking as my anti-stress thing.

Anyway, I brought a pack and swore to myself it would be the only one, I felt horrible for doing it but I couldn't think of anything else to do, I was super stressed out and worried.

That was a month ago, I have smoked at least 2 packs a week since, I am finding it hard to stop again, most days in my head I think about going out for a smoke or going and buying another pack.

So yeah...idk what I wanted with this post, just to get that off my chest I think. 

I will be trying again from tomorrow.

Thanks anyone who took the time to read this all the way through.

Champix Question

Or Chantix, for my U.S. friends.  I am feeling absolutely diabolical today, and I wish I meant my usual propensity for evil.  I stopped taking the pills on Saturday because, frankly, they are bloody horrible.  Anyway, I was fine yesterday, but today I’m feeling utterly dreadful.  Headache, sickness, the lot.  I don’t even know if it’s a complete coincidence and I’m simply just unwell.  For anyone who has used these and stopped, let me know what adverse side effects there might have been for you?  I appreciate that they seem to be different for everyone.

Just noticed my flare 4800 days!

A nice round number, that's 13 years since Feb 1 2003 the day after my last cigarette.

I honestly think if I was still smoking I'd be in a bad way by now, I had been smoking for 18 years and the affects were definitely showing, weird pain in my throat, cough, shortness of breath, weezing etc etc. 

Here in Australia I think cigs now cost around $25AUD per pack and I was on at least a pack a day so at that price I've saved $118,000AUD or around $90,000USD (realise price has gone up over the period), in reality it's probably more like $50,000US, I work a good few months to earn that much, hopefully I can retire a bit earlier!

In my case I claim no credit, it's all thanks to Allen Carr's magical book.

Thinking back to then I was trapped by tobacco and honestly thought I'd never escape, I'm now 100% confident I'll never smoke again, in fact if the world was ending tomorrow I wouldn't waste my time smoking.

Good luck all, its worth it!

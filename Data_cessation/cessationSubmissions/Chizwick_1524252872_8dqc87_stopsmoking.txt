Over a year later, I still crave it every day.

I was never a heavy smoker. Maybe one on my way home from work to help me "breathe my stress out", and then a few at parties with friends. But eventually I decided to cut them out of my life and I quit cold turkey.

Now my job's more stressful than ever, and I find it harder and harder to resist going back to those relaxing drives home.

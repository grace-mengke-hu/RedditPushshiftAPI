Help, I'm falling off the wagon!

I stopped cold turkey on 11-19, and went a week with no nicotine. Lately I've been smoking shitty cigars at night, and today I bought one in the daytime. I don't want to a smoke, I want to run, to be smoke free, to make my fianc√©e proud. How do I overcome this feeling of "I can smoke just a little, it's not like I NEED it"?

Here I go again

I just stumbled upon this subreddit today and have been smoking for about 4 years. I have probably tried to quit around 20 times. My reasons for quitting are pretty typical (health, money, social stigmas). I have always quit cold turkey because I believe that using other forms nicotine just prolong withdrawal. By quitting numerous amount of times and always relapsing ( some quits longer than others) I have noticed that some quits were just easier than others. My question is there any advice or scientific reason as to how to make this "quit" easier. Also I could use advice on how to stick it out for the long haul because some how my brain rationalizes that smoking again would be more beneficial than not smoking even though I know this is completely untrue.

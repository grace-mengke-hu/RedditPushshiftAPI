How long does constipation last after quitting smoking?

Ok I've finally cut down to only 1 cigarette today and I did take a few hits off another cig today but threw it away after 3 puffs cuz I realized what I'm doing. However, in order for me to quit that last cigarette a day, I need to find something that can relieve constipation. Years of drinking black coffee on an empty stomach every morning with a cigarette has made me dependent on caffeine/nicotine in order to even take a dump. Increasing fiber/water intake just makes the situation 10X worse. Laxatives...if only there was a safe and all natural laxative that won't make me feel like I'm dying. What else is there to do? Should I just carry on living life with just one cigarette a day? Or should I start eating lots of chocolate(this always makes me need to take a shit even without a cig) , but chocolate makes me feel super horrible and I have been in a state of deep ketosis for over a year so my tolerance for carbs is very out of whack. Does anyone know how long this constipation issue will last? Will it resolve itself? And is this type of constipation detrimental to health? I'm just super nervous about this because I find that I just become a grumpy mess when I don't have that 1st cig of the day:(

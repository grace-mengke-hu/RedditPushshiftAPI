I just don't know where to start

I started smoking when I was 14 and I'm 26 now. My husband doesn't smoke any more, he quit 8 years ago, but he has never said a word against me smoking. I've tried quitting before. Cold turkey, vape, patches and gum but nothing ever stuck.

In the end, I don't really want to quit. I like it. But I also know we can't even begin to start thinking about kids until I quit. I know I'm a ticking time bomb that could have lung cancer tomorrow. I know it's not helping me in the aging process, in the health department. I know all of these things, but I still can't find the will to stop. It gives me anxiety all the time, it keeps me up at night. Knowing I have to stop, knowing we could have so much more money if I did. It weighs on me daily. I've talked to my doctor, but his advice has been slim to none and overall even he doesn't even seem to think i can. 

Where do I start? How do I even begin to think that it's possible for me to walk away from this? How do people find it in themselves, the will power, to just stop? Help me, reddit. I have no one else to turn to on this one. My whole family smokes. My friends smoke. I need you.

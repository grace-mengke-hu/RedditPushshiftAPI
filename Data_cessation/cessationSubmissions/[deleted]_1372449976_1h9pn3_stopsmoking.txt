Tired of smoking, I'm quitting. Wish me luck.

It's been 20hours since my last smoke. Read that book everyone is always going on about, it's pretty effective. I've been smoking since 14-15 & I just turned 28. I never tried quitting (except one time but it wasn't me, I tried quitting with my gf at the time. That didn't turn out well at all & we kept smoking.) So this is my first (& I'm confident it will be my last) attempt. I've already quit much harder things (like something in your sidebar) so I'm using that as motivation: "If I can quit X than I can quit smoking". Tbh I don't want to smoke anymore. I'm just tired of it, if that makes sense to anyone.

I've been lurking on here these past couple of weeks & I've seen the "It's been X months & I'm so much better" posts. Hopefully soon that will be my story too. 

If anyone has any tips please let me know. I used to smoke around 30 a day.

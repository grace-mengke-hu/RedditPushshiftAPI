One Month

15 or so years at a pack a day (37 y/o now). A number of unsuccessful quits over the past 4 years (went a few months a few times)

This time I had one moment in the first week when truth be told if I had had a cigarette to hand I would most likely have smoked it. Thankfully I didn't and here I am now, feeling and looking like a different person.

Anyone finding it tricky in the very early days - stick with it. I am now confident that I will never take another puff and it is 100% worth it. After that first week this has not been hard. In my mind I have come to accept that however good life smoking might have seemed to be it was all an illusion, and even if it was not, the life without smoking that I remember is and will be again far, far better.

Best of luck to all in your quits. 

I just wanted to post something that might make a difference to somebody wavering at the outset or wondering if they can do it and I hope this has some small effect of that sort.

Day 1, everything in the universe was working to piss me off.

My coworker was late to work and I took a bunch of tables outside my section and it was overwhelming, I come home and my roommates are drunk and obnoxious when I've just cracked my first beer and want to chill and watch netflix after an annoying workday. Also, we've been slow and the money ain't right. I'm also stressed about my face breaking out. And I can't sleep now. Last cigarette was 10 PM Friday night, thanks for existing r/stopsmoking

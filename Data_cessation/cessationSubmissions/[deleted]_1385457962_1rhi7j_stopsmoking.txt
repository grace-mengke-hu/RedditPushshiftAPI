Day 1, considering nicorette

Hey all, ok a few things I wanrted to ask. I've had a dry cough for two years, smoked a pack a day for like 5, and got to a point where at 3am, if i cant sleep, i go for a smoke. I'm quitting today and ordered nicorette patches. My throat's been sore for two weeks and the coughing makes the act and smell of smoke too unpleasant for me to even enjoy, but i get urges whenever i'm outside to seek a tobacco store. Think nicorette will help?

also is a 2 or 3 year long dry cough something to be alarmed about?

Also how many of you continue to smoke weed? I would like to continue to occasionally get high, but cigarettes are ridiculous. If discussing weed is against this sub's rules or anything I 'ppologize, my questions are listed in order of relevance so you can go ahead and ignore this third one

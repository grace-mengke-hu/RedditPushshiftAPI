I face a very peculiar problem. Any advice?

I've been a smoker for almost 10 years now. I've wanted to quit for a long time. The maximum I've been able to do is two months.

When I really make up my mind to give up, the first month is usually easy for me -- unlike most people.

But here's the problem. As soon as the first month of no-smoking is over, something ticks inside me, like a switch that goes off... like I've proved to myself that I can quit and then somehow start putting myself in situations where there will be a chance that I'll light up. For instance, a night out drinking with friends.

I don't know how to get past this. All I can make of it is that for me, the physical dependence isn't as much of an issue as psychological dependence is... and all the effort I put into quitting goes right down the drain after a month or so, when I eventually light one up and get back to it.

Anyone been in a similar situation? Any advice?

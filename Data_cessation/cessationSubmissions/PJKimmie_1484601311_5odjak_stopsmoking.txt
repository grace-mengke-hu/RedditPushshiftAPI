UGH. This Is Not Fun!

I know I'm probably supposed to be all happy and shit about not smoking for a week, but I hate it. I know it'll pass, I've quit many times (once for 5 years), but I can't get past the whole feeling like I'm being deprived. I guess I never realized before now just how much I depended on them - emotionally, physically, etc. Anyway, this seemed to help. Thanks for the space to rant. 

152 cigs not smoked

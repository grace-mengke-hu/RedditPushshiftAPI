Day 4! Still going but support would be nice :)

Hey guys! So....day 4. I'm proud of myself! After 13 years smoking and 3 attempts at quitting, this time I'm absolutely motivated and it's the end of cigarettes for  me. I'm 25 and have two beautiful daughters that I want to see grow and have kids of their own. I have friends and family that I want to keep seeing. I want to be able to run and not be winded after 40 seconds. I lost family because of cancer caused by cigarettes. I'm also doing this for me, because I matter too. These are the reasons I keep on going and resist no matter what! I. CAN. DO. THIS. 
Thanks y'all, just a girl that's tryin'

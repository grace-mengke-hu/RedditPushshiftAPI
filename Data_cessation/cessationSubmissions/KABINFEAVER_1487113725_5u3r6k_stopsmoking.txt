Thank god for this sub. I thought I was alone. - Day 5 NICOTINE FREE!

Hi all. I'm so glad I found this subreddit. Reading through the posts and actually seeing that other people went through what I am going through really helps me. I've been smoking for 6 months, between 2-5 months being my heavy smoking months. This last month was more of a tapered down month with me smoking around 3-4 cigarettes a day AND vaping 6mg of Nicotine from my vape device. On Friday I decided to stop smoking cigarettes and vaping, cold turkey.

Anyway, for the past 4 days I've been having pretty bad anxiety, loss of appetite and almost a depression. At first, I thought "yeah this must be because of the nicotine withdrawal" but, what was really weird is that my anxiety has gradually gotten worse from day 1 and has actually been at it's worst today (day 5!) but perhaps that's because I haven't been keeping my self busy. I spent all day at home and had way too much time to think about my withdrawals. It got to the point where I was constantly googling "Nicotine withdrawals" etc, and was getting so worried that many sites didn't actually list anxiety as being one of the withdrawals. It got to the point today where I actually thought I'd developed some serious anxiety disorder. Anyway, after reading this sub reddit it seems that my withdrawals are normal, and I'm not going crazy!! THANK GOD lol.. This may sound so strange to you all to hear, but being so misinformed about the withdrawals from stopping smoking, and then suddenly having all these withdrawals it has been pretty hard for me, I've had no friends who have stopped smoking so it's all a new concept to me, I'm a 19 year old male BTW.

Anyway, just to sum it up, I've been experiencing:
- Anxiety
- Slight depression
- Decreased appetite (probably due to the anxiety)
- Headaches in the morning (peaked on days 3 and 4)
- Weird, memorable dreams
- Time going REALLY slowly (just today, on day 5)
- Loss of interest and pleasure from most activities

Would you guys say these symptoms are normal of nicotine withdrawal? One weirdly notable thing which I haven't experienced is cravings for cigarettes.. Really weird, but I don't doubt they will come soon. Thanks and good luck to all those who are also quitting smoking; we can do it!!

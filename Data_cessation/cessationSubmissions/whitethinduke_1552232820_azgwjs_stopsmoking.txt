It's so easy to break down

I am on my 4th day without smoking and I had my ups and downs. I usually host parties at my house, and there was alcohol involved, but still kept a leveled head in these days and survived these days without a puff.

But today was a special day, I felt like I needed something, I needed that puff to fill my chest, all the while my girlfriend and I were making plans to go out shopping. I said I am unable to go, and changed my mind because of the craving I was undergoing. She didn't understand, and started nagging about how I postpone the sopping (although I didn't postpone shopping, not even once, this year), of how my word means nothing, and how I can't act normal.

Right now I feel like having a breakdown.. somehow it's so exhausting to not smoke, and the fact that my girlfriend doesn't understand what I'm going through its kind of the worst feelings for me..

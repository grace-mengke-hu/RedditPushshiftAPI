Starting over - play with fire get burnt

Welcome to day two.  Had made it 3 months without smoking.  Thought all the cravings were beaten.   Then while gambling and drinking, I deluded myself into having just one.  Made it a week then had another one.  Then 4 days later I started a trend and had one each day after work.  Boom, now almost a month later before I pulled my head out of my ass.  Quitting a 10-20 a day habit again.  Anyways, be vigilant all.

Edit: guess my tag needs reset.

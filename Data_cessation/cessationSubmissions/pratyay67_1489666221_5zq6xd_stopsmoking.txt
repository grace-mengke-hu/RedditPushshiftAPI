Constipation. Relapse. Help!!

I stopped two days ago, but today it showed up. My bowels. 
It's like the shit's stuck halfway between my stomach and my butthole, and no matter how many glasses of water I drank, it stayed there still. That's some stubborn shit. 

Then I bummed a fag from one of my friends, lit up, and it was only 5-6 puffs after which I had to run to the toilet. I didn't smoke it whole, and nor did I smoke again through the day.

Is there a solution to this problem? If every morning I need a few puffs for my bowel, then it kinda defeats the whole point of quitting, doesn't it? 
How can I get rid of this constipation problem without having to get a few puffs?

Going to try this weekend but a question

Fairly excited to try to be honest. Itâ€™s been a long time coming and ive been slowly weening down. So hopefully all goes well!

I do have a question though, why am I always cold? Could it be from smoking? Been a 2 pack a day smoker for 10+ years. Curious if there was any correlation?

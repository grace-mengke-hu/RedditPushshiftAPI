Smoking is a waste of time. #day5

I can't count how many times I sneaked outside a restaurant or a meeting or a theatre to smoke. How many good times I ruined because I was in need to my dirty dose of nicotine. 

Smoking is a waste of time. This is my 5th day in my quit attempt and I already feel free. I don't need to go to the far cafe that allow smoking anymore. I don't need to make unnecessary walks to smoke a cigarette. I have a lot of free time now to do things and enjoy more social occasions.

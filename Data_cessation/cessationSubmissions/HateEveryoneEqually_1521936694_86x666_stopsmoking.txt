For anyone thinking about vapping.

I have been smoking a pack a day for 7 years and tried to quit cold turkey multiple times with no success. 

Just bought a vape yesterday for about 80 bucks (using 9ml, might up it to 12ml) and havn' t touched a smoke since. I even stood beside my buddy as he had a smoke and didn't get the urge to light one up. 

Leaving this here to let you guys know that it is definitely an effective way to quit or cut back.

One month and one day nicotine free!!!!

Hi, I am a woman, 40 years old and I started smoking when I was 9. At age 14 I started smoking every day and only quit once for a month 5 years ago. I did not stop when I was pregnant, when I had pneumonia and almost died, when my friends and family begged me to, when my friends died of lung cancer... Why did I stop smoking? Because by some strange miracle I started hearing a voice inside of me (which I probably didn't want to hear before) that told me I had to quit because I was "killing myself... Suicide!" I don't want to die. Not for a stupid cigarette that does nothing good for me or loved ones around me. This suicide has costed me a fortune. 1 pack a day for 26 years... Sometimes more. Do the math. How did I stop smoking? One day at a time. I told myself tomorrow I could smoke a whole carton but "just for today" I desire to remain nicotine free. I renew my desire every morning. Cravings got less maddening after 2/3 weeks and now I find the smell of smoke revolting. It smells like cigar. It's very bizarre really.
I do feel a little crazy and my body is detoxing still. Very tense... But worth every second of the struggle. Wishing us all to keep on the strength. Peace

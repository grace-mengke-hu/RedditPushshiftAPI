Day one! Here we go again

This is not my first time doing this, but it honestly might be the first time I've TOLD anyone about it.  Maybe that'll prove the difference.

I'm 44, and been smoking since I was 19 or so.  That's a long-ass time.  I've been trying to take up running, and it's been going okay, but I KNOW I can do better.  I'm sure smoking is holding me back.  That's to say nothing of the fact that I'm no spring chicken, and have been doing this crap for a long time - the health thing is starting to loom.

So, that's it - I'm done.  I'm tired of hiding it from coworkers.  I'm tired of the expense. I'm out.

Now to stick with it - that outta be easy.  :)

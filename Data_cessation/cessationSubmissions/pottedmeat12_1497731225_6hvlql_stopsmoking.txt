First post, looking for support.

I've been a medium ish smoker for 7 years.  The most I ever smoked is a pack a day, and that's all I could handle.  I quit successfully for 6 months using NRT, the patch.  Unfortunately, I fell back into the trap after a few drinks with a friend and a cigar.

Now I'm smoking again, and almost had kicked it with the patch a second time.  Then, I used the excuse of a stressful week (right after I finished stage 3) to light up again.  I figured that approach wasn't working so I read Allen Carr's Easy Way and was very excited about my quit.  That lasted maybe 24 hours before I gave into my mind's craving. 

I sit here smoking, hating it.  I understand what easy way says, and I know I don't enjoy the smoke, but it's just satiating the craving that was created by the previous one.  

Do I read the book again?  Do I go back to the patch?  I'm at a loss here.  It sucks.  I don't want to continue down this road.  I miss being in shape and active, but it just saps your energy as I'm sure others can relate to.

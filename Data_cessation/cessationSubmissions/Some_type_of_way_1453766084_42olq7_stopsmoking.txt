I need some help.

Today was the day I convinced myself that I was addicted to cigarettes. I'm only 19 years old. I smoke about half a pack a day. I'm really starting to get scared about the whole thing. I can force myself to go a whole day without smoking. But whenever I run out, I tell myself just not to buy any more. But I start to get all anxious whenever I pass by a gas station and break. I need some advice. Thanks for anything.

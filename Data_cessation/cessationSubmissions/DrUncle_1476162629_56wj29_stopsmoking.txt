So happy! 1 year anniversary of living smoke free after decades of f'ing Newports.

Here's what helped me: Allen Carr, by far, the biggest help.  Helped me realize I didn't really enjoy inhaling hot smoke and the impulses to repeat old behaviors were just fractions of time that quickly passed.  Then I found a Reddit buddy who quit on the same day so we supported each other and that was cool in those first days especially.  Then I also downloaded the Smoke Free app. Once I decided I QUIT it was a no-brainer and virtually painless.  The handful of impulses I had, I'd tell myself, "It's not even an option" and that killed it for me.  Enjoy your smoke free life!

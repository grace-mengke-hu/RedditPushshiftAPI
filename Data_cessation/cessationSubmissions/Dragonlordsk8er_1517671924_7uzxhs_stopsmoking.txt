Hey guys I quit smoking about 5 days ego (been a 1 packet smoker for 5 years) but my mouth smells like shit any tips haha?

I clean my teeth every day, personally I love the smell of a smokers mouth but my current mouth has a weird taste how do you guys deal with it? 

Don't have any issue with my mouth (go to the dentisit every 6 months) I think it's just the normal human breath thinking about it  while righting this I remeber I used to smoke in the morning just to get rid of this 'normal' taste in my mouth. Before getting addicted to cigs.

Anyways any tips? maybe mint gum?

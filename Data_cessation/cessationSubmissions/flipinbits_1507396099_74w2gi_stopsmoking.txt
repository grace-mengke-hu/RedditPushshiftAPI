Day 1

9 days into taking Chantix and it’s time to put the e-cigarettes down. Last time used Chantix I quit for 2 years. Only a few hours in and I’m feeling nervous tingling in my arms and the cravings are kicking in. The Chantix doesn’t seem to make e-cigarettes as repulsive as it did regular cigarettes so I’m not so sure how this is going to go. Going to power through it today. Wish me luck!

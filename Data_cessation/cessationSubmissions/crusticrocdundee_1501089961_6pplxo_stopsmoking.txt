weird on and off stage but i think i'm going to the right direction?

I've been "quitting" and then smoking again for quite some bit now. Sometimes I've went entirely cold-turkey and sometimes I've used snus as a replacement, which at least seems to have prolonged the periods of time I've been able to go without smoking. But now, the last time I smoked was last Saturday, and I'm actually feeling good and not really craving: half a year ago I couldn't go a day without, so I guess something has happened either mentally, physically or both that's been making this process smoother. Quitting drinking has certainly also helped, though even the presence of other smokers in any kind of drinking environment can be quite the struggle and has caused most of my relapses. I have not bought a pack of my own after a relapse in weeks. 

I hope the one I had last Saturday is truly my last one but I don't want to jinx it either. I just feel like I'm reaching a point where I genuinely don't want to smoke, and kind of accepting that relapses don't destroy all the development even though I hate myself for them whenever they happen. 

I seem to be pretty well over the need to smoke when I'm at home but social situations and long periods of waiting for something are still my weak point, but less so than before. I kind of always hated myself for being That Guy who bums cigs off random people off the street and that is certainly an aspect of my end-of-the-month experience is certainly something I'm not going to miss.

Idk if there was any actual point to this but while there's still a lot of shit for me to overcome for the first time maybe it's starting to look like for me this murdering toxic shit is something I can overcome, and will overcome. 

Next step is actually getting off nicotine, but I feel like the social and habitual aspects for me have been much harder to overcome.

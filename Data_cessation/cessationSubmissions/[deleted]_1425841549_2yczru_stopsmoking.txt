Why did you quit smoking weed and how old were you

I started when I was 19 years old and I am realizing now I want to quit. I am now almost 26 years old. I realized that now that I am out of college and trying to find a job, that it was about time I quit. I like it, maybe go back to it when i'm older. But it is about time I get out of this constant haze and get my shit together. Smoking weed to me was is now like going to the club. It got old, and was more for the young kids.

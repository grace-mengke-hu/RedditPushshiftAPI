After a month of not smoking; something curious.

I quit smoking on the 12th of October, I remember the date because it was my mum and dad's birthday that day and I had ruined it by being really ill.

I was bedridden for 2-3 days so that helped me to not start smoking. Now, I've been a regular smoker for the past 5 years.. (at least 15 a day.).. but after those initial 3 days.. I was like.. if i've done 3 days, might as well try for more. And went on a week.. then 2 and now a month without smoking.

The curious thing was.. that despite being a decent smoker.. I did not once have the general symptoms of cessation. (Apart from a brief consitpation.). Hell, I did not even get the cravings. Even at work, my friends go out for a smoke every hour and I tag along with them.. I dont even get the urge to ask for a drag. Instead I find myself standing away from the smoke.

Over the last 2 years, i'd tried quitting almost 20 times.. never went a single day without a smoke still. But this time; it was easy as fuck.

*Why?*

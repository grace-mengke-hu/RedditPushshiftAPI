One month no cigarettes

I quit smoking a month ago. I'm 23, started smoking when I was 14 and I smoked a pack a day for the past 5 years. I got so sick of my lungs hurting all the time so I started vaping and smoked anyway, just not as much. Then I learned vaping's probably just as bad for you as cigarettes anyway so I quit and threw everything away. The first 2 weeks were a bitch and I was totally losing my mind but I didn't wanna smoke so I just powered through it. My moods been a lot better but the past week I've been really missing it and it's almost like I'm mourning. I've been contemplating smoking again and totally rationalizing why it isn't that big of a deal but I'm a stubborn asshole and I fucking hate the tobacco industry so I'm sticking with it for now. Do/did you guys go through this whole rationalization thing and how did you deal with it? I'm a recovering addict myself so this isn't the first time I've dealt with something like this but if you hit a 'bottom' with cigarettes it's probably already too late and it's not like if you pick up a cigarette you're gonna immediately ruin everything in your life. Sorry if this is all over the place and doesn't really make sense, I'm also hoping just writing this out will help. Thanks.

I know I don't want to smoke, but I am don't know what to do.

I'm at a wedding right now. I have no desire to smoke a cig, but I'm feeling very depressed and confused. I'm the only single one here and that sucks. How do I deal with this shitty situation without smoking??? FUCK, this sucks; I'm 18 days in and i though I passed the roughest part. I was wrong. 

Edit: Well, obviously I'm the idiot. "I know I don't want to smoke, but I don't know what to do."

My coping mechanism (eating) always makes me go back to Smoking

Titles says it all, well mostly   
While quitting aint easy, feel like thats something i can handle   
The real Problem for me is that my Eating Disorder (had that all my life since very early childhood and way before i ever started to smoke) goes absolutly bananas when i have nothing to ... fill  me.   

Somebody having similar Problems with binging food while trying to stop ?   
Any Advice ? Been chewing gum like there is no tomorrow and drinking alot of Tea.   
Thanks in advance :)

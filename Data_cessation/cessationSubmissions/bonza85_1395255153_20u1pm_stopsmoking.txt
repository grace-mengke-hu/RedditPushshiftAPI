Nearly 60 days in. Weight dramas?

Okay. So except for the first week i have gone through the no smoking thing quite alright. I did start running to help prove what i am doing is good.

Now i don't know why but the last 2 weeks i have been eating everything in sight. Nothing is out of bounds. I feel like a bloated mess. I don't want to go back to old habits but is there suggestions as to how to stop this?

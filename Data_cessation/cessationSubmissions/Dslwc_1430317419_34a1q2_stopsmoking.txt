Loneliness and smoking

Just wondering if anyone else finds loneliness a trigger. 

Posting from my phone. 

More info: I just wrote down all the people I know who smoked. All my romantic relationships and my husband (who is an ex smoker, but he seems to be the exception) were or are smokers. All my very best friends were or are smokers. 

I also mapped out the when I started smoking, and all the times I've quit and then gone back. 

The common thread was that when I started and my relapses were times I felt extremely lonely. 

Anyone else? Or have suggestions on how to buffer that for when I do quit, it won't cause another relapse. 

For what it's worth, yes, I have anxiety/depression. Yes, I'm being treated for it. This is part of my therapy "homework". I do plan on talking to my doc about it, but I wanted to know what you all thought as well.

My strategy to stop smoking.

I'm a pretty light smoker compared to others. I smoked about 1-1.5 packs a week for 2 years now, and lately I've come up with a strategy to quit. 

I started smoking Lucky Strikes and fell in love with them. I liked them so much I couldn't tolerate smoking any other cig not even camel unfiltered. Luckily there is only 1 place I can get Lucky's in a large radius and it's a supermarket that close at 7PM. 

I asked to work the PM shift at my hospital where I get off at midnight, so that eliminates me getting my cigs at prime craving time, just after work. I cannot smoke at work for reasons of patient care, and before work I barely have enough time to go out of my way to get cigs since I started boxing again.

So I guess main tips are, distract yourself with something else (ideally something healthy, like working out), and find a way to make buying packs less possible than it is. I also have temporarily quit going out drinking with friends, and unfortunately have not went to the supermarket in 2 weeks and have been living off hospital cafeteria food!

It's been 14 days wish me luck!

Worried about possible weight gain

Hi! I'm new to this sub so I apologize if the post I'm making is something people ask about a lot. I've been smoking a pack a day for 6 years. I put on a little weight last year but have been sticking to a diet and exercise plan for the past few months, and I've almost reached my goal weight. All of the exercise makes me want to quit smoking. This is the first time I've EVER actually considered quitting. I just want to feel even better than I already do. Anyways, I'm really afraid I'll gain weight. I would hate to gain back everything I've worked so hard to lose. If I stick to my diet and exercise, will I still gain weight from quitting?! Everywhere I look online says weight gain is inevitable. This sucks haha I'd rather keep smoking than gain 10 pounds which is probably gross to admit

Afraid for this weekend - 5 friends who smoke and me

Hey, 

So Saturday to Sunday i'll visit some really good friends, we will go to a party, have a good dinner and so for the new year. 

The thing is they all smoke ! And i'm really afraid that I'll not have a good time as a non smoker with my friends, i mean we met 3 years ago thanks to ( or because of) the cigarettes ! ( You know, you're at a party, you share a smoke, you talk, you exchange number). 

When I was a smoker the night was, have a few drink, chain smoking and music, really fun. That what i'm really afraid, it's to go there, see everyone smoke and be like "peer pressure" myself and smoke with them. 

Do you have a trick or something ? (Allen Carr's book is really good, it put me in the non-smoker's perspective but how to manage yourself when you are the only ex-smoker ?  )

Thanks a lot guy :)

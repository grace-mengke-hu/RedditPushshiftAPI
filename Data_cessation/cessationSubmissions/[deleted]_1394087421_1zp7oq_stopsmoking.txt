Day 1.. again. Fighting the good fight.

I've lost count of how many times I've tried to quit but I need to stick to it this time.
I don't want to lose my voice box.
I don't want to get cancer.
I don't want to have to be hanging out with my friends while lugging around an oxygen tank.
I don't want to have a stroke and not feel orgasms or lose limbs.
All of these risks because a couple of times a day I feel a desire (which I created, it wasn't there to begin with) to go outside and suck smoke into my lungs.
I realize I will be depressed and it will be hard but I need this cycle to stop. I literally gain nothing.
I challenge myself to see what it feels like to get into that 2nd week, the first month, to see what kind of ways I find to distract myself. If I can't make this change then I don't see how I can make any other changes, and if I can't make changes then I will become stagnant and stale as a person.
It can be so easy to let things trigger me into the spiral.
I had a life before smoking, it was a better life. I was more productive in every aspect.
I can do this. I have to.
All of you out there quitting, let's do this. I know we can. It's a comfort to know you are out there and you are feeling what I am and we are fighting the good fight together. Thanks for reading this.

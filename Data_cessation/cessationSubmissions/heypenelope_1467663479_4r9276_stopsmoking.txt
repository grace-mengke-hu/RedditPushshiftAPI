Day 5 - triggers, triggers, triggers!!

This is my 5th day smoke free and my biggest issue is the amount of triggers I confront in a day.  There were a few aspects of smoking I genuinely enjoyed and, of course, those thoughts are the loudest when something triggers a craving.  I am determined but really wish I could just see the whole thing for it's filthy and disgusting truth without part of myself missing it anyway. :(

Finally done it??

I've been smoking 16 years and never once thought I could give up smoking but this is my fifth day now and not had a single fag!!!! 

There's two things I've found remarkable so far. One, I can take huge breaths which taste so fresh! Two, everything I'm eating tastes soooo much better!!

If I can give up anyone can do if you're sat thinking I wish I could, just do it!!!!!

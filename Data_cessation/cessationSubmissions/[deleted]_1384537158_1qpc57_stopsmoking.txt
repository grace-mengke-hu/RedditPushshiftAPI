Intense cravings after 3 years...

Hi there. I'm new here but I just didn't know where else to turn.

Recently I became very ill and was hospitalised for a week or two. The diagnosis was that it was probably some sort of virus. Now that I'm out on extended sick leave(I'm still having some symptoms) I've got the most awful constant cravings. I really feel like I need something to get me through the day, like there's nothing that will make me happy. It's making it really really hard to relax and recover from the illness.

Has anyone else had anything like this? In hospital they gave me a lot of medication (ondansetron, codeine, sedatives for operations) and I'm wondering if that has anything to do with it. The illness also caused me a lot of stress in my new job. At the moment things are really hard. Feels like I'm quitting smoking again from scratch even though I haven't smoked in years. Apart from a small cigar many months ago that I didn't even inhale.

Any advice/thoughts is much appreciated.

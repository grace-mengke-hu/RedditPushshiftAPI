oops, missed posting on Day 90...probably cuz I don't think about being an ex-smoker the way I thought about being a smoker.

That's about it!  Still checking in here occasionally but as the days and weeks pass, it's easier and easier to forget that I used to smoke.  For a long goddam time too!  Like almost 30 years!  Anyways, for those in the early stages of their quit, keep on keeping on.  It gets easier & easier.  You'll never want to go back after a certain point and you'll start to forget about it over time.  My wife says it's hard to remember me smoking, what it looked like, how I smelled, those 10 minutes I would go missing throughout the day, the piles of butts in the coffee can on the back porch...it's all gone and I don't miss any of it.

Keep it up all!  :-)

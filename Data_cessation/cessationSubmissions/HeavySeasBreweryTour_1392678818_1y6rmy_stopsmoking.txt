Only one cigarette today.. Need some encouragement.

I consider myself a pretty heavy smoker. Half a pack to a pack a day. Ever since I got a vape pen I've seriously cut back and today I smoked the last cig in my pack and I'm doing my best to not buy another pack. My vape has nicotine in it so I shouldn't have any serious cravings I guess.. It's just the habit I'm itching for right now. And I am seriously itching. I'm doing my best though. Not sure if I'm proper quitting just yet, so I make no promises, but I'm definitely trying to become an ex smoker.     
Any tips to fight the "habit cravings?"     
P.s. I think this community and the support is wonderful. Keep on keeping on fellow fighters.

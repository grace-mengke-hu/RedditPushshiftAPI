How the hell do you keep from verbally assaulting every idiot who pisses you off?

I haven't even been smoking for that long, maybe 5-6 months, and decided it's not worth it. Today's my first day off of it, and I literally want to kill everyone I meet. I have such unadulterated rage towards everyone, how do you stop these feelings? 

Lol yes, cigs probably helped suppress a host of mental illnesses for me.

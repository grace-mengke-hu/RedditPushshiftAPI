New quitters, what level are you at?

Congratulations, you've finally quit this horrible addiction. So now what level are you at with regards to smoking, and those who still do it..

Level 1. You have a "laissez-faire" attitude. If people still want to smoke, it's their health and their life. Their decision whether to quit or not.

Level 2. You might offer some encouragement to someone you see smoking, and encourage them to get help. Maybe have a quiet word with a teenager you see with a smoke.

Level 3. You hate what people have done, or , are doing to themselves, and you are willing to share your thoughts with them. 

Level 4. You possibly know someone who has died of lung cancer, or had part of a lung removed, and want to offer your insights to those still addicted. You might introduce them to the Allen Carr book.

Level 5. You are a frothing-at-the-mouth, radical crusader against smoking and everything connected to it. You are prepared to move heaven and earth to help someone who is an addict to get clean.

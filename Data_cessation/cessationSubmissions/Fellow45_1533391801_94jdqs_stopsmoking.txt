It's my one year anniversary!

It's been one year now since my first serious  attempt to quite and it wasn't the best timing to be honest but it will never be a perfect time to quit so it has been many relapses since then but i managed to keep on trying and 6 months  out of 12 i was smoke free so I'll take that as a win.
Now I'm two month since my last relapse i hope next year I'll be posting my 12 months smoke free.

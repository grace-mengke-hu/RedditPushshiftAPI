I quit yesterday, going "cold-turkey"

Hello, I'm 21 and I'm a college student who's been smoking about 10 cigs a day for 4 years. I've tried to quit on several occasions, but now I want to do it for good. It's been 24 hours since I smoked the last cigarette.

I'm afraid that I wouldn't be able to do it, because most of my friends smoke. I also go to parties a lot and after drinking a bottle of beer the urge to smoke gets pretty intensive.

There's another thing keeping me from quiting: my most interesting conversations were held during lengthy cigarette breaks and I think I will really miss using smoking as a convinient excuse to go outside with someone I like and spending some intimate time together, although while performing an activity which is killing us.

I had a date.

A normal date guys. No distracted nicotine conversation, no subterfuge, no fiending, no delusions of I don't smell like smoke even though I just smoked. The whole date & nicotine free me is still new. I've never dated a smoker. Hate how they smell. It was all so refreshing. And those 15 extra, I don't smoke anymore, pounds. I just kept saying voluptuous, voluptuous. Worked out just fine.  Thanks for sharing my middle of the night excitement.

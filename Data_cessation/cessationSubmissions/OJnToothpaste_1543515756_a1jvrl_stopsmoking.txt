Fell off the wagon after 1.5 years

Posting this as a cautionary tale. I was pretty sure that it was going easy for me for a long time little to no struggles no urges to smoke the whole time. Then I got a new job and not to make excuses, I decided to smoke one off day I had and slowly but surely I became a smoker again.  I never got back to the pack a day 12 year habit I initially kicked but even a quater of that was enough to make me feel bad.

 I was smoking ~5 a day for ~3 months. I kinda enjoyed it for a week or 2 but after that I knew I was just a slave again. It started to feel like a burden everytime I'd smoke and I knew it wasn't where I wanted to be or what I wanted to be doing.

 So I'm back to say I'm back at it as of 7 days ago I am a non smoker. It was much easier to quit this time so if anybody falls into the same rutt I did try not to let it keep you down. The sooner you quit the better.

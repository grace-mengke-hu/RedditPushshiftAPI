10 weeks tomorrow!

So, tomorrow it has been 10 weeks since my last cigarette. It feels awesome!

After smoking too long, and after trying so many things: cold turkey, cold turkey with Allen Carr, Nicotine gums, nicotine inhaler, snus I finally tried vaping. Vaping has made it so easy to quit, something I never thought would be possible.

Me and my man started by cutting down, replacing some cigarettes with vaping. I felt really fast that the cigarettes tasted aweful. I started to not be able to finish a cigarette but felt disgusted before even reaching half of it. It was wierd because I used to love these stinky sticks for so many years, thought it would be impossible to let them go. However, now suddenly I didn't like them at all (?!). So, one day when we were out of cigarettes we decided that we would not buy any more. We have been smokefree since that point :)

I have suffered pretty much all the side effects from quitting smoking: a bad quitters flu, some quit zits, coughing up "adorable" mucus, sneezing. Since it can take up to 9 months for the cilias to recover, I'm prepared that it probably take that long until I'm cleaned up inside.

The gains from quitting has been noticable as well. First, getting back smell and taste. It has been for both better and worse ;) Food has been tasting great, I've notice myself smelling nice. But I had issues with the emissions from traffic, the smells were overpowering at first but it has started to get a bit better. And of course, the smell of other peoples cigarettes. I can smell it from miles away and it is disgusting. And if someone smokes close by it feels like you are almost smoking yourself, the smoke feels that strong. Is it really that bad? 

And what is also interesting, is that when I have tried quitting through other means I have actully enjoyed the smell of other people smoking cigarettes. It has made me jealous and has made me crave a cigarette myself. This time, the opposite is happening. I can easily say that I would gladly turn down a cigarette, should someone offer me one.

Other gains is that when I look at my hands, my fingers no longer have yellow tints on them. They now look like normal hands. I can also tell my teeth have become whiter.

My beathing has improved, and that is the gain I enjoy the most. I can now climb stairs without running out of breath, and I can walk much faster with much more ease, even run a bit if I like ;) My blood circulation and heart rate have improved as well. And, believe it or not, I have also gotten better hearing (?). Guess my sinuses had more issues from smoking than what I thought.

This is my current long story, than you for reading :) And do quit smoking, the gains are too good to miss out on, and it's worth every effort!

Have a nice weekend all :)

Just six feet away....

An unguarded pack of smokes, it would be just too easy to reach out &amp; take one, she wouldn’t mind, of course i’ve thought about it, who wouldn’t..??
The only thing stopping me is having to reset my counter on here &amp; the promise i made to myself nearly 50 days ago..
Would be a shame to throw it all away now..!!

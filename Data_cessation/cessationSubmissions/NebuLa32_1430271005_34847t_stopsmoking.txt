Smoker for 10 Years (18-28) quit since 24.12.2014

Hey everyone,

i really liked smoking. So much at one point i smoked about 2 packs a day.

Tried hard to quit for 2 years. I picked fucking cigarettes and buds from 1 week old garbage bins like a stray dog. Not proud to say this.

Don´t know why i picked Christmas 2015, sounded like a good idea in my head. I smoked less and less over the last couple of months. The last one was in the cellar of my brothers house, tasted disgusting but i finished it for symbolism.

I think i made it. 

No more regrets, no more demand in my head or body. Not when drinking, not in stress. No thinking. 

I made it.

Recap of 10 Years:

Got sick, stuffy nose, cough, bad skin color (sun light did nothing to me, i was pale - started to look kinda grey), didnt hold weight, yellow teeth, bad taste of body fluits (woot), took longer and longer to heal small wounds, bad nails... the list is endless.

Now i look better, i gain and hold weight and muscles, my skin color is insane i almost can´t recognise myself. My fucking teeth are white as ivory. No more coughing, no more breath problems, i think wounds heal faster - but that probably will take more time. My nose still makes problems but - its spring. Lets see.

Im  fucking proud.

Cigarettes suck.

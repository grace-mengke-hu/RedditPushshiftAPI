Day 10, a few distractions that worked for me

- Got my bike from friend's garage (it's been there for two years...) and drove it home (~5 miles). I was so out of breath... but I felt good afterwards!

- Cleaned my balcony and washed the balcony windows (I could barely see through them), and imagined they were my lungs. It was rewarding to see the results. Now instead of using it as my smoking area, I let my cats hang out there. 

- Got asked out for drinks on Friday and Saturday, told friends I've quit smoking and that I'd stay away from bars/alcohol for sometime. Everyone was super supportive. 

- Watched "Top 40 scariest anti-smoking commercials" on YouTube. 

- Played a lot of Candy Crush Saga...

Stay strong everyone, we can do this.

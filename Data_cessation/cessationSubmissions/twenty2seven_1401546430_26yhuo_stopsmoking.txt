quit smoking advantages you haven't read 100 times before

*we all know about improved general health and more money and longer life and less chance of cancer, but here are some not so common advantages:*

* never leave your room questioning if you put out the cigarette and have to return home because you are afraid that the house might burn down.
* never again the 'shit-i-dropped-the-cigarette' panic while driving.
* no more cigarette burns in clothes.
* never again worrying about going to the nightshop to get the nicotine before it closes.
* never again the endless conversations with smokers outside about how we all want to quit.

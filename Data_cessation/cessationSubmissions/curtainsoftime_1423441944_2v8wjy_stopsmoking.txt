Cigarettes are holding me back

I have been running for about 8 weeks now using the Couch to 5k app. Despite what cigarettes were doing to my body, I figured I could run without giving them up. And I was right for the first few weeks. Then I was running for 20 minutes and I would cough my lungs up afterwards. Today, I ran for 28 minutes and I felt a very painful headache and felt I couldn't go on. I was able to finish but afterwards I was coughing more than I've ever coughed before. I couldn't even speak I was coughing so much. Instead of feeling great after running, I felt horrible all because of the cigarettes. I decided to finish reading Allen Carr's book because I knew I couldn't go on like this. I was doubtful about the book before but because I really wanted to quit this time I paid attention. Now I feel like I really have an understanding of the addiction to quit it. I smoked my last cigarette after finishing the book and it tasted awful. Usually I enjoy smoking, but after finishing the book I finally realized that cigarettes are poison and there's nothing good about them. I now know that I will never smoke a cigarette again.

Hi I have been reading this sub for several months now . I am from England I have wanted to stop smoking for so so long , after every cigarette I tell myself that’s it no more but still continue . I had a brain tumour removed last June and you would think that was enough to make me realise how precious life is . I am coming up 52 . I stopped smoking for about 10 years once , but went back to it through stress . I hate how it makes me smell , I hate it when I kiss my girls goodnight that they can smell cigarette s . I have read Alan Carr s book several times and think it’s an amazing book but I still can’t manage it . I v been thinking about maybe vaping . I also wonder what f I stopped smoking if I would recover from the brain surgery as I still have a numb face caused by nerve damage during the surgery. I get really angry with myself as I know I am lucky to be alive . So please any help would be so appreciated

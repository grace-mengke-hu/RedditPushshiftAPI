I will free myself from cigarettes today!

I have been smoking for more than 9 years now, I'm 23. I quit on April 6, but I started again 11 days later. It felt so great without cigarettes, I can't quite understand what made me start again. I am disappointed in myself, but I will make it this time! I have one last “ceremonial“ cigarette left which I will smoke in a couple of minutes, then it's goodbye for good. I will keep you updated about my progress, who is with me?

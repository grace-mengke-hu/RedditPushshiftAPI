Its been nine days...but has it?

Its been nine days since I declared that I quit.  That said, I have fouled up twice; first time on day five and second time on day seven, I feel like this makes me a terrible person.  Anyway, the nic fitting is gone, their are some triggers, like ghost hand while I am driving.  I can smell again, taste again and run up a flight of stairs without an issue.

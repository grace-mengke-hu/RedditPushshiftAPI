Day 29

Hey all. 

I just hit 29 days smoke free and wanted to share with some folks. I've gotten immense support from friends and family but I'd like to share my experience. 

When I first started, I had a tough time. I have nicotine patches from my doctor so the hardest part was deprogramming the oral fixation and habits surrounding what I'd do on breaks at work. I had a few smokes in my first two days but ended up giving myself a nicotine overdose at work and puking in the washroom. 
I haven't touched a cigarette since.

More recently I've stopped getting any major cravings. It is worth quitting and the cravings do go away! I've also saved almost 200$ this month and according to the app SmokeFree, a lot of my health has come back as well.

In some cases I've also used those Popeyes candies to get over the oral fixation (lol)

I'm curious to see what's worked for others and to hear your progress!

2 more days

In 2 days, I will be one week with out a smoke. I was good till last night. I want to light up so bad. I am not sure why. I am not stressed just missing it. I miss the routine, the ritual. I sound crazy but it was nice knowing they were always there. A reason to go step away and take five minutes.

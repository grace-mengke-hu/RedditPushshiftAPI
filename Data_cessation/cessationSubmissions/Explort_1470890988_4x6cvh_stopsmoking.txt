I feel like I'm about to pass the threshold of social smoker to "I really need a cig right now" smoker.

I only smoke one a day, and not every day. Just a casual user. I've found that it really helps me when I'm starting to get burnt out from studying. But this week I've been feeling the urge starting to ramp up. I know that this is a crucial moment and I could use some advice on how to stop before it becomes a serious problem.

Update: Hey guys, thanks for all of the support. I ended up tossing my pack and didn't smoke last night. I gotta quit while I'm ahead. It was rough, but that just made me think of how rough it would be if I tried quitting a year from now, or two years, ect. I'm gonna subscribe, keep myself reminded that I can't let myself go down the wrong path.

Thanks for everything.

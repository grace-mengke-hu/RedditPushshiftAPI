4th day is over, and I realised many things.

First of all, I want to say thank you to the people who took some of their time to encourage me, even if it were just a few words. Also, good job for the words of encouragement you also give to other people!

I wanted to share some thoughts I had, if it can help anyone or have some positive effect, then mission accomplished!

-First : I quit cold turkey and had no date or time planned. I did that in the past and always failed ecept for once for 1 month, then I fked up and smoke again. What's different rhis time? After the 3rd day, i'm not craving a cig anymore, i'm not fighting an impulse, not having a debate between two voices in my head (one saying smoke and the other saying quit).

-2 : I think i'm not craving anymore because I had a big realisation : most of the cigarettes I smoked werd not only not enjoyed, but I smoked them out of habit. These last few months I really started to hate smoking, everything about it. When I bought my last pack, I enjoyed my first cigarette because I tried and fail to quit. But I swear to god, the 24 cigarettes after were out of habit and not in relation to a craving or even a strong desire to smoke : the first cig of the morning, the cig after eating, the ones on my breaks at the job, the one after the job and during the ride back to my place, and the one before going to bed. After I realised this, I felt even more disgust with smoking and my weaknesses.

-3 : after the 2nd day, no more cravings because I changed my mindset. I'm not sacrificing something when I stop smoking. Because I realised that I mainly smoked out of habit, it did not feel so hard to resist that few seconds of wanting nicotine. It's the opposite : I'm making sacrifices WHEN I'M SMOKING. Sacrificing my health, my money, my time, my freedom, my attractiveness. 

I hope these things were at least interesting to read for some of you. Stay strong everyone, we can do it!

Lasted one week. Cracked last night.

It was going so well. I was feeling amazing, training harder and not suffering withdrawal or anxiety. I was using this subreddit and found reading the posts to be a brilliant resource whenever I needed it. Then last night I went for a few beers with two friends of mine. I cracked. I smoked and I feel horrible today. I need to stop again. I know people will say that I should steer clear of drinking, but I live in Ireland and it's just so central to everything that happens socially. My girlfriend was so happy with me. I haven't told her I cracked yet. We're going away for the weekend with her parents and I just know her dad will want to go to the pub for a few pints, and I'll be tempted again. FUUUUUU.

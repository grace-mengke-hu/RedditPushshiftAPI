Meet the brute. (NRT warning)

This is a post I promised [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/2jgi4l/opinions_on_using_vape_to_quit/).  It is a conversation among people who are well into a quit.  There is ecig and NRT stuff within.  Choose your path.

Meet the brute:

 My subconscious is a lovable brute (remember the book *Of Mice and Men*?). Brute is not very smart -- he seems slow.  But we give him some simple jobs.  He takes them very seriously.   He does the breathing, the heartbeat, he tries to keep me safe.  He is a gentle giant.  Often when I am about to unload my wit or sarcasm, he gives me a nudge and says *vape, this one is in pain.  be nice.*

 Somewhere along the way, brute started to think of smoking as one of his jobs, just like breathing. That explains why I would look down when I was busy and find a full ashtray and a cigarette in my hand.   

One day there was a blizzard.  I found myself in the car going to get cigarettes.  This was dangerous.  I have a child, an ex-wife and the attorneys to take care of.  I was not out of cigarettes.  Brute was driving.  He said, *We gotta do this vape.*  We *would not*, we *could not* run out of cigarettes.  

 When people have posted about digging cigarette butts out of neighbor's garbage or 'borrowing' money from their children for smoking, I see brute and he is saying *This isn't going to be pretty, you don't want to watch.  It is what has to be done.*

 When I tried to quit, brute would get very scared. He takes the breathing very seriously. He is powerful and lightning fast when he is scared.  I would find myself smoking when I had quit and when there were no cigarettes around.  This is not tricksy nicotine monster.  This is brute.  I had to get him on board.

 I gave him the e-cig, but I put strongly in my conscious mind (so he heard it all the time) that the two of us were breaking free.  We were moving *toward* safety.  We were swimming *toward the surface*  we were getting where we could breath easier.  He eventually got it.  With brute and I in agreement, nothing could stop us.

 Some of this I figured out after I quit.  I learn so much being here.

 I don't think everyone is the same.  Some people need to hear that it is okay not to smoke.  Some people (me!) need to read Carr and learn that the 'relief' of a cigarette is like tight shoelaces.  

I joke that nicotine gum works for some people -- and they all quit about 15 years ago.  Brute tells me that is not a nice joke and somebody might be quitting that way right now and not know what I mean.  He is right.  Sorry folks.

But I smoked for ten years after reading Easyway.  And I gave familly members copies and stuff.  But I was in my prison.

So one/some of my quit-brothers said he thought the e-cig/vape was a waste of time and money.  I disagree.  I spent all this time writing this so they would know why.  I appreciate the time they spend here every day and I know they feel the same about me. 

Go in peace my friends.

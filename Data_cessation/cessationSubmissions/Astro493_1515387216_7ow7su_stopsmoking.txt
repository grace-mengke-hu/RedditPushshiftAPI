Day 6, the cravings are now starting. Turned to 0mg vape. Worked wonders

I'm on Day 6 of my quit and this morning the cravings were too strong to resist. I went for a walk, ate a bunch of shitty food, and then tried watching some movies to distract me. Nothing worked. 

Around mid-day I had an idea. Maybe it was the act of smoking that I missed, and not the nicotine itself. I had an old vape and dug it out and made my way to a store that sold the juices. I bought a nicotine free liquid and have been using it. It worked wonders. The act of exhaling smoke instantly killed the cravings. 

I know a lot of people shit on vapes, and people will warn me against them, but it's worked very well for me, and I have only used it twice today. The cravings are still there but much more manageable. 

Stay strong my fellow quitters. We can do it!

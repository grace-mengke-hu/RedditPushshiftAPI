Is smoking a Juul a good alternative/good way to start quitting?

I'm curious because a LOT of my friends are smoking these things and I'm debating whether or not it's worth it. I definitely want to quit smoking cigarettes but I'm not sure I'll be able to handle the nicotine withdrawal and will just jump right back into my bad habit.

Thanks for your help!

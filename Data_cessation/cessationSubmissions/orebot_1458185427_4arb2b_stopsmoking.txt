day 2 almost done.

Hello all,  just wanted to thank this sub for the inspiration to keep positive on all my attempts to quit.  I'm feeling really good about this go.  Long story short I met a girl on tinder that actually seems like a great person!  She is definitely not a fan of smoking and although I never smoked while we saw each other, she could smell it on me, while I thought I was being sneaky.  Crazy how immune to the stink smokers can become.  Anyways she became the catalyst for me to jump back on the wagon.  Like the title says, i'm on day number two.  I have been chewing some nicotine gum to help with the cravings, and I know cold turkey is the best way to quit, but hell I think to myself chewing gum is a lot better then sucking down smoke.  I know this is gross, but a little while ago I started coughing up crap, and it made me happy.  amazing how fast the body gets to work on cleaning itself out.  
side note I have smoked for about 15 years at a pack a day for most of that time.  I have quit before for a number of months, but always found myself coming back.  I think im old enough to know now this is not some phase or lil cute game I can play anymore.  I'll try to keep trucking and hopefully keep you up to date with me progress.  

Oh yea one small thing that seems silly but has helped me.  Often times smokers need cigs to relax, as most of you know cigs are themselves a stimulant, and its the deep breaths that actually calm you down, not the smokes.  So when feeling a little overwhelmed, I close me eyes, and take 3 deep slow breaths and that seems to help me a lot.  Also it gives you a reminder to stay present in the moment, and know that this will pass.

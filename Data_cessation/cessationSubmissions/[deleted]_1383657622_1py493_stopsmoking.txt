Today I will not smoke at work.

I've just decided.  No dramatics, no nicotine replacements.  I'm just not going to smoke during my 8am - 4pm shift today.  We'll see how it goes.  My badge is still here from last time.  It has been 167 days since my last attempt.  I messaged the bot thinger to have it removed.  1/2 ppd for 10 years.  $14,600 over the course of my smoking career.  Unreal.

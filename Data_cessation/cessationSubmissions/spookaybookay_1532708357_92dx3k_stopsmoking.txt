Easy Way or Easy Way for Women?

I've read quite a few comments saying that the Easy Way to Stop Smoking book has helped a lot of you drop smoking for good. I'm looking around online and there is another version of the book specifically for women - has anyone used it and found it was unique in any way?

Just wondering if I should get that or the original, TIA.

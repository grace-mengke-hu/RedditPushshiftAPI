Any other New Year's Day quitters still going?

Go us!! 

I've had ups and downs, some pretty intense cravings and moments of extreme fear at the thought of never smoking again, but I've stuck with it. I've never really been into New Year's resolutions but the idea of saying I haven't smoked once in 2017 is actually really helping me! Hope the rest of you guys are still going strong :)

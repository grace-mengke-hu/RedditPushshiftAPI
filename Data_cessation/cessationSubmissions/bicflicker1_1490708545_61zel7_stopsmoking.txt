Starting third day and..

So I've started my third day and my anxiety is through the roof! I normally suffer from pretty bad anxiety and I know it's to be expected, but it is severely heightened I suppose by the lack of smoking. 

I know I could easily go have one and it'd be done but I'm go no to suffer through!!

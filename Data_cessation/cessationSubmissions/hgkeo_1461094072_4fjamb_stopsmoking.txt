Who else is going through depression from quitting?

I'm 8 days in after a relapse at the 10 day mark. The initial withdrawal and cravings are gone. I've noticed some positive effects, not a whole lot, but my breathing is improving. Overall I have this feeling of depression, and lethargy come and go in waves. I don't feel comfortable in my own house, and there's a gray tint to everything. The funny thing is that I have no desire to smoke, not after the shit I've been through this month to quit. I just want to feel normal again, have my energy and positivity back. There's shit that needs to get done. 

 I'm listening to Music as I type this so I feel a bit better now. Maybe I should listen to more music. So how is everyone else feeling?

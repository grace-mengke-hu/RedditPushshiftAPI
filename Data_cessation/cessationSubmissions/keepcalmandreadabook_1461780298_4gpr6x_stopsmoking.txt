Someone once told me to "never quit quitting". Here goes again.

After 155 days of no smoking, the longest streak I've ever been from not smoking in my life (previous streak was over 100 days, so I've been really excited), I ended up failing and picking up nicotine again. But I quit last night as of 1:30am, and haven't had one all day, and I'm trying this again. 

Here's what led to my relapse, in case it helps others:

* First, I hung out with someone that smoked weed. I liked her, things got heated, and I ended up smoking weed, too.

* While with her, she had e-vape. I had tons of anxiety, I also had not smoked weed for just as long as I had cigarettes, and I asked her what the nicotine level was. **This was the moment I failed,** because I had already implied that no matter the nicotine level, I was open to at least considering hitting her vape.

* I hit her vape, which, while it only had 3mg, was enough to make me want more nicotine later. Kept hitting vape throughout many "smoke sessions".

* Eventually this led to one night of me just smoking the tobacco from a leftover blunt (gross) rolled up in a joint paper because I didn't want to cave and buy cigarettes. I said to myself as long as I don't smoke cigarettes, I don't have to reset my counter. I was lying to myself, at this point.

* After a day of smoking cigarellos, I caved and bought a pack. I smoked one one day, and another in another day, ending last night.

Fucking. Hell. Smoking will bite you like a fucking snake. Just when you think you beat it, it's done, it's still there. 

So never quit quitting.

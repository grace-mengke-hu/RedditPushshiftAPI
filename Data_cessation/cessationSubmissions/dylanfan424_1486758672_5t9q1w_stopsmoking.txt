Today is the day!

I've attempted to quit many times before, but I feel today is the day. I've been reading Allen Carr's the easy way and I am sick to death of coughing from this cold I've had. So it's time to finally kick this horrible addiction. Share with me your tips for success. I want to make it stick this time!

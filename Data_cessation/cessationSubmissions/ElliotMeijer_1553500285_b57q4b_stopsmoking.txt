Had a relapse after the passing of my brother recently and find it hard to get back on the horse.

I stopped smoking for about five months but my brother passed suddenly in January. The first thing I did was reach out to a pack of cigarettes. I want to stop again, I’m disgusted by how I feel as a heavy smoker, I’m out of breath again, I notice people’s disgust when I sit next to them in the train and it’s costing me a fortune. However I tried a few times since and can’t manage to pull it off like before.

Everyday I see a posts from this subreddit and it motivates me to try again. I wanted to ask what’s the best time, but I know the answer. Now. Wish me luck!

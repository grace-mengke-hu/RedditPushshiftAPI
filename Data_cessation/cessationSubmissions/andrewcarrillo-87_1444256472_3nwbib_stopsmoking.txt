Quit Day has arrived

My quit day has arrived at last...this morning I ditched the rest of my cigarettes and juice for my e-cig. This is probably my 20th+ attempt to quit cigarettes for good. This is the first time that I've tried using Chantix (day 8) and it seems to be helping quite a lot. I would really appreciate any words of encouragement. I'm also 103 days clean from drugs and alcohol...trying to ditch this last substance addiction so that I can get my health turned around for good. Thanks guys!

Weird/funny motivations for quitting

I quit smoking for a lot of the typical reasons (health, money, etc) but also because I had this terrible vision of me in a beautiful white dress on my wedding day smoking a cigarette behind the church. I'm not even close to getting engaged so its totally random, but whatever works, right?

Any similarly random motivations?

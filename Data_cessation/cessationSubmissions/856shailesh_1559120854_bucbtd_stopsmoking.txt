17 Days of being a non smoker!

I have been smoking from past 2 years and today is my 17th Day of non smoking. Below are the changes I have seen in myself , I am 26 years old from Delhi India

1. I don't have to make excuses at home of going outside and smoke.
2. I have saved around Rs 600 \~ 10$ in these days.
3. I have started running and I am extending my pace/distance gradually.
4. I feel good about myself and my self confidence is high.
5. I drank alcohol 2 times in these days and I had a strong urge of smoking but I didn't do it.

Now i will not touch the cigarette ever again.

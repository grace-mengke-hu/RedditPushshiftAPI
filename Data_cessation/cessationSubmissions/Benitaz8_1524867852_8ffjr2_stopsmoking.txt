I’m on day 5. The depression is driving me crazy.

I feel like I’ve lost my best friend. I’m using the Nicoderm patch so I really don’t want to smoke but I’ve been depressed for two days now. The only thing that has been helping me is my new dog. She’s 8 years old and I rehomed her drone someone who could not give her the attention that she needs. She’s such a sweet baby and when I’m home and feel so down I pick her up and love on her. She has been my best therapy.

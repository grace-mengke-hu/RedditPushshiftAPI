I am crazy addicted to nicotine!!

I am addicted to something called snus. It has as much nicotine as like 20 cigarettes in one dose. And I need to stop!!! All of my friends do it and we all have tried to stop but no one has managed to last 2 days. Itâ€™s difficult af. Any advice to get over the cravings and withdrawals?

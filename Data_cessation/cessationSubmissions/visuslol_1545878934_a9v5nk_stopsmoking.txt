Stopped smoking 2 days ago. Worst symptoms i could imagine

Hey everyone,

 

At 25.12. i felt so sick and energieless, that i couldnt smoke at all. So i took the chance and stopped smoking since that. the withdrawals were pretty handable. 

For the last few hours i feel rly bad though. But i m not sure if its from the withdrawal or from the sickness that did hit me quiet hard. Symptoms are no energy, headaches,  nausea, limb pain, dry cough, fever... IÂ´ll visit a doctor today to make sure that i dont have influenza.

But i wanted to ask here in advance: Are these symptoms common for cold turkey?

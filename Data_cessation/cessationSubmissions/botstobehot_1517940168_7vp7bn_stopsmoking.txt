Over 19 days without a cigarette and don't know how I never felt shame for what they did to me

Has anyone else ever came to the realisations of what they were like when they were a smoker? I used to go through the ash tray of my car, collect the tobacco out of extinguished cigarettes until I could roll one. I would skimp on a weeks groceries for tobacco. I sold beloved games from my childhood I held on to so I could buy a few packs of cigarettes. I would hide cigarettes from my girlfriend and wait until she slept and go out at night and smoke so I wouldn't have to share and buy another pack more soon. I smuggled over 10 cartons of cigarettes over a year into Australia without paying tax just so I would always have a supply.

I am not this type of person but cigarettes had a grip on me and played an integral part of my life. I felt like such a dirty, cheap and deceitful person at that time. After quitting my health, bank account, and self esteem has gone up so much.

Just for a background on how much I used to spend, check my previous post in this sub.

Insomnia after quitting coupled with loss

Hi

My Mother had been a smoker for about 25 years. She quit smoking almost 8 months ago only a month after her father died from a brain cancer. She hasn't had any slip ups but she is struggling with disturbed sleep, she gets up a couple of times a night 'to use the toilet' which she never did before all of this. 

Had anyone else struggled with this? I know its quite common but it seems to only last for the first month or so for most people. 
How can this be treated? (she will NOT take sleeping pills and she won't want to see a dr as they never seem to take this stuff seriously, or offer anything other than pills)

I'm really proud of her for quitting and its very frustrating that this is happening

Thank you

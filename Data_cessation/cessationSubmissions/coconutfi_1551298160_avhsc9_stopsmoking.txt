Can you convince me to stop

I bought a Juul because I had tried my friends and liked the different flavors, and since no tobacco I thought it would be fine.

I used it almost daily for a few months.  Ran out of pods and stopped with no withdrawal symptoms or anything.  I never felt like I needed it, I mostly used it for appetite suppression and also I like the seeing the smoke (idk, thanks smoking ads).

I’ve used and stopped using with no problem.  I started up again after a few months of not using it again for appetite suppression/distraction.  This time is a little different though.  I never used to smoke enough at once to get that buzz, but now at my job I sneak it during bathroom breaks whenever I feel hungry or bored and I do smoke enough to get the buzz.

I’m worried I had no problem stopping before because I never felt the buzz.  I still can go without it like over the weekend, but I know I’m playing with fire.  I think I have a false confidence that I won’t get addicted because I’ve started and stopped so many times before.  Can someone give insight to this/convince me I will get addicted?

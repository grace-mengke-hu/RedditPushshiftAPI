Well here I am again...hope this doesn't happen to you!

I quit smoking last year and was smoke free for over 100 days, maybe even close to 200.  And then I got cocky and over confident.  I stopped coming on this site to stay motivated, I stopped looking at my list of reasons I was quitting, I just oh so naively thought I was in the clear.  

And then I had a drag, and then a full cigarette, and for the past month have started buying them because I didn't want to be "that person" that is trying to not smoke so just bums cigarettes off everyone else.  

I had to reset my badge today which was such a bummer, it would have been over 400 days today if I had actually kept it up.  However, I am here.  I am committed.  I am trying again.  Day 1.

My advice to everyone else on here is don't get too comfortable.  The cravings are there for months and months and it really is just a matter of having one drag that can lead to the slippery slope of smoking again.  Stay vigilant!  Good luck everyone!

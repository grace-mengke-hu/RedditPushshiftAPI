One month clean

I read Allen Carr's 'Easy way'. And then I read it again. And I hated it. It was patronizing, and it was redundant. It felt like some kind of scam the whole time. But I guess something clicked the second time, because I really decided to try to quit. And then I did. At first it felt like it was in spite of Allen Carr and his book, but I mean, I read it and then I stopped smoking. And it was easy, and it continues to be easy. Those first few days were rough, but since then it's been smooth sailing. 

Also, does anyone else have the occasional dream about smoking cigarettes?

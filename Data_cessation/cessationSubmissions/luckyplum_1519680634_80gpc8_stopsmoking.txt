How high can you climb?

I've been having some fun on and off with this. If you smoked normal cigarettes, they measure 84mm. Multiply your unsmoked cigarettes by 84 (or for yards, multiply by 0.0919) and put it into [This website.](http://www.bluebulbprojects.com/measureofthings/default.php) Find out how you stack up!

My 1,630 unsmoked cigarettes laid end-to-end is more than 1.5 football fields. And 1.1 times as tall as the the great pyramid of Giza! Neat!

Some quick googling tells me that I'll need 9857 cigarettes to get to the top of the Burj Khalifa, and... roughly 4.3 billion to get to the moon. I think I can do it, guys.

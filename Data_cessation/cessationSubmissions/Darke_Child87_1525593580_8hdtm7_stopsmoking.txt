Everything tastes terrible :(

People told me that everything would taste and smell better. I've been smoke free for over a month and since yesterday coffee tastes like its got out if date milk in it, my perfume it's really strong with one spritz and my food smells like throw up to me. Why's this happening I feel like I'm gonna be sick when I smell food cooking. I'm proud of quitting g but the taste...smell.. How long will this last, forever?

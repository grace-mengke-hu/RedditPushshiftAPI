Even after 255 days, I wasn't safe.

I cracked hard today, bought a pack, and smoked.

Postpartum hormones are horrible. I feel awful right now because this was the last thing I expected. I quit when I found out I was pregnant and was determined to stay quit for my daughter... And I cracked.

Now what? I don't want to put my daughter at risk and I don't even know why I bought the damn things besides stress... And that's not even a good reason. 

Please tell me this gets easier.

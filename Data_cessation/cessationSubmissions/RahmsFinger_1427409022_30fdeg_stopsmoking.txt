Survived the airport and travel trigger!

Some inspiration for those who (like me) used to look forward to getting outside to smoke after a flight, more so than actually exploring their destination...

Tackled the short weekend trip via plane. It was easy, if I can do this, you all can too! Thank you all for the support these past 85 days.

Yay!!!!!!

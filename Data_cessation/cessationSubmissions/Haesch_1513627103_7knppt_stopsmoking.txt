Today I am going to do it

It's been 7 years since my first cigarette, and I've been hooked eversince. There hasn't been one day that I didn't smoke a cigarette. Today will be the first day (5 hours to go, but still) that I won't smoke in those 7 years. It's too (excuse my language) fucking expensive and bad for my health. So I hope I will keep on. The itch is unbearable, but I gotta make the best of it. Do you have any tips for a beginner in stopping with smoking?

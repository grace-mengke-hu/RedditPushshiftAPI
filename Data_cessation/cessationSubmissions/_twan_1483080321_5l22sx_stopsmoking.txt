Day 9 not smoking and intense anxiety after one drink?

So I'm on day 9 of quitting (Woohoo!!) and it's not been easy but it hasn't been hellish (only a smoker for a few years) but this entire evening and about two days before I had the longest, most intense bout of anxiety/panic I've had. It feels like an overwhelming sensation that something's wrong but I know nothing is. The only difference I noticed tonight was after one drink it felt super super intense. Has anyone else experienced this? Any ideas how to cope?

Still failing at quitting, still winning at trying to quit. Also, should I quit ciggs or weed first?

I keep coming back here and making posts about quitting and how bad I want it, but I keep fucking up. Today I did something really embarrassing. My brother has a piggy bank for emergncies. Times have been very tough for me and stressful and I've been buying packs from that bank, leaving I O U's. I am afraid to count them, today I pulled the last spare change of quarters to buy a pack, and I realized there's a good fifty something bucks worth of I O U's in there. My brother doesn't even know. He's my roommate, and I feel awful, so low.

I have to quit. I have to now. I won't quit on someone else's cigarette. I have to quit on my own, my own way, or do I? I feel like I have to smoke my last favorite cigarette, and that it always has to be at night, but so far that hasn't worked. And yes, I read Allen Karr's book. It helped me quit for a year but I started up again and although I know all the head knowledge about quitting yada yada it doesn't matter or mean shit when I wake up and all I can think about is quitting.

I have some vacation time coming up, and I'm hoping if I haven't quit by then I can do so then. Work is hard to quit at, because there is a mound of smokers waiting to offer them outside, and I get two or three breaks a day where I could go smoke.

Also, I want to quit smoking weed, too. Is quitting both at the same time unreasonable? Which should I quit first? I need help, guys, I keep getting older and every cigarette I smoke I feel like I'm killing myself, just a bit by bit by bit.

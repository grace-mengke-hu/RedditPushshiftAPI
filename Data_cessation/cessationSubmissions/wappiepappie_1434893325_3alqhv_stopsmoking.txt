Boom! 2 Weeks!

Hey guys, since my first post here saying I'd quit, two weeks have flown by. Damn it feels good not to be bound by smoking in everything you do. 

Best of luck to all new quitters! It's easier than you think, you can all do it!

To everybody on this sub: You've been a giant inspiration and coming here to see some posts have helped me through some of the worst cravings, thanks for being here /r/stopsmoking.

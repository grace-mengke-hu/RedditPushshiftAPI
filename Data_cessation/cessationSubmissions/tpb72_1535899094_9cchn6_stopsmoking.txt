Omg this is so stupid. How do I cross to really wanting this?

I so badly want to quit smoking but not badly enough apparently.

Why I need to stop smoking:
1) can't afford to smoke 
2) hate smelling bad
3) hate what it's doing to my health
4) hate the power it holds over me
5) hate being an outcast

I've now gone through Allen Carr's book numerous times.  The first time in December I did quit for 2 months but then was an idiot and slipped.  I felt wonderful when I wasn't smoking and had very little issues being around smokers.

So after Allen Carr disproved the brainwashing that i actually enjoy smoking and that it really isn't doing anything for me I'm a believer but for some reason I can't make it happen.

Every weekend when I say to myself I'm going to quit, I then negotiate with myself that maybe today isn't the best day.  I'll quit another day.

I'm thinking I just don't want it bad enough while I do really want it so bad.

Any suggestions of how I can push past this last little bit and have the conviction to actually follow through?  I just feel so stupid and weak.

How do I get over this last fucking stage?

Hi all, I am 20 years old and I have been smoking for probably about 5 and a half years. at my worst I was a pack and half a day, for the past month or so I've been at about 4 cigs a day. I don't even buy my own packs, I bum these disgusting capri slim cigarettes off my mom. The past week or two I've been at barely 2 cigarettes a day.

I just can't stop myself from going cold turkey damnit. My mom makes it so easy by leaving half shorted cigs in the ash tray that I can just nab up, and by the end of the day I've smoked the equivalent of 2-4 cigs. Yes I know how ridiculous and lame this sounds My friends have made fun of me for doing it, but damn I just can not go the distance and stop. I sometimes manage to go a day or maybe even two without smoking but there is no real streak ever..

sorry this is more of rant than asking for advice, but I am very frustrated and want to stop but the urges overtake me all the time. Anyone else in a remotely similar boat?

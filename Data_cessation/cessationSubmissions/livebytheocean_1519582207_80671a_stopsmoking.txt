2 weeks!

Just wanted to check in with you all! I’ve appreciated this sub so much over the past 2 weeks. Last week I was in a really dark place, but I think the worst is behind me. A few things that helped - I drank fizzy water whenever I had a craving. I went to yoga a lot. The main thing - I read this sub, and told myself that I never want to go through a quit again. 

Great things since I quit - my mouth feels sooo much healthier, and my teeth are actually whiter! I smell great - I’m no longer constantly washing my hands or spraying my clothes with febreeze or perfume. I am so proud of myself! We got this!

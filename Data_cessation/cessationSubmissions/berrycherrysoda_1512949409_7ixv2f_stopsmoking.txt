Hi guys! Two months since I've had a cigarette! Yahoooo!

This has been a very difficult journey. After a horribly stressful day at work last week, I pulled into the gas station parking lot and I was THISCLOSE to walking in and making the purchase, but I didn't. So glad I was able to maintain my streak! Two months! Yesss!

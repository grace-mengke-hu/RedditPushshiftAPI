I'm not sure it counts

l quit smoking about two months ago. My reason is that I want to learn how to do the Melbourne Shuffle. When I tried to practice, I had to stop after about a minute.  I was really embarrassed of myself.  So at that moment I picked up an e-cig and havn't smoked since.  I found that my lung capacity is returning,  although exercise is still a personal obstacle. My sense of smell has greatly returned and I generally feel better.  The problem is that I havn't stopped using the e-cig. I was wondering,  does it still count? I try and justify that it is inherently different than the genuine article,  but I keep feeling that I'm cheating. What's worse is that my family is proud of the fact that I've quit smoking and go further to tell me that the e-cig is fine. I'm not sure what step to take now.

TL;DR : Wanted to dance,  couldn't. Used e-cig, everyone congratulates. Feels like cheating.

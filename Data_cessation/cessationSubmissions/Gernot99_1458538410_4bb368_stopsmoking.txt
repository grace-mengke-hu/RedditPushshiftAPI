Please help - I need your advice

To all the more old-seasoned non-smokers out here:
I am now on day 25 of not smoking, but every morning I wake up and first thing I do is checking my non-smoking app on the progress I made. It feels like I am doing a job here and counting the days when it's done, so that I can get back to have a cigarette. Not sure if this makes sense to anyone here what I say, but if u went through the same feeling, can u pls let me know when this will end and I will just wake up not thinking about smoking at all anymore? 
Oh btw I still keep dreaming that I smoke again nearly every night ...

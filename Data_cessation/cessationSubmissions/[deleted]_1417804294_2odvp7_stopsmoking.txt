What a weird dream

So most people who quit smoking, dream of smoking.  Not I.  

In my dream I had a pack of smokes that I had about half the pack or so, and I took them out of my pocket, opened them up, looked at them and threw them out.  At one point in my dream I was like "ah just one more won't hurt" and so I headed back to where I threw them out, but all I could seem to find was my old Blackberry Pearl, which I was happy to have found and started to use again, forgetting all about retrieving the pack of smokes.   Very odd dream. :)

Today is Day #1

I've tried to quit multiple times over the past few months but I've finally had enough.  I woke up in the middle of the night last night just to cough.  I'm 23 years old, this shouldn't be happening.  I have this horrible feeling that I can never fully breathe in all the way, and that my mouth always feels dry and tastes bad.  I don't want to feel so weak anymore.  I just need encouragement because I've tried to quit so many times and couldn't even last a day.  I need to take it one day at a time.  What is your best tips for new quitters?

Had a literal wake-up call today...

A while ago I took part in Stoptober, and actually managed it, and a little extra. Unfortunately, a combination of my social life and work stresses led me back to smoking again. I didn't have the heart to tell my parents I had cracked and so hid it as best as I could. 

...Unfortunately, yesterday, my step-dad (being the stereotypical arsehole step-dad) went into my room while I was gone and found my packet of Lambert and Butler. My parents announced when I got home that they'd thrown them out, and that if I wanted them I would have to rake around beneath a pile of dust and rubbish because they'd emptied the hoover over it in the bin outside. 

I went to bed, and all night, all that I dreamed of was raking through the bin and desperately trying to find the cigarettes. I dreamed that when I couldn't find them I started looking through all the bins in our house, and slicing open bin bags and searching through gunk and gross rubbish to try and get to them. It was disgusting. 

When I woke up I felt seriously ashamed of myself, for letting myself get so hooked on smokes again. It made me realize that I am addicted to them again, and have a gross dependency on them. 

I'm not going to go looking for them now. No way.

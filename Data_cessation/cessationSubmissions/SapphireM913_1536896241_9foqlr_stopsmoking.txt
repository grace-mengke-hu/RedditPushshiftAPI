It smells not great

I live in an apartment, two of my neighbors are outdoor smokers. I have been on patches and the occasional lozenge for the last 6 weeks, and today, for the first time since quitting, the smoke wafting in the patio door doesn't smell alluring. 

Today was a win. A big win.

Lol, I just remembered that I said I'd quit smoking by the time I turned 35... That's today. I did it. Jesus Christ, I did it.

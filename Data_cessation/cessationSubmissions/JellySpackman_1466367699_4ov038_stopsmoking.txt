Quit smoking

Ive been trying to give up smoking for 3 weeks now and although i have bought a packet ive still been smoking no where near as much as i did but still 2-4 smokes a day isnt classed as quitting and i want to to quit. Does anyone have any advice on how to stop myself from having a smoke? Or even just how to get through. I seem to be able to do a day or 2 without smoking but then suddenly theres a smoke and I'm thinking to myself why did i smoke this but i cant seem to get myself to put it out. Has anyone had this problem? ðŸ˜£ðŸ˜£ any advice please

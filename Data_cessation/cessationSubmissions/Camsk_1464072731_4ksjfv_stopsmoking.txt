Trading cigs for dip

So I haven't had a cigarette in 3 days now. I switched to dipping for just a bit. I'm only dipping when I get a craving for a smoke so I dip maybe 3 or 4 times a day. Although I do enjoy dipping, slightly, I'm only doing it to get my mind off of cigarettes. I haven't craved a cigarette all day today. And I won't be hooked on dip because I can't stand to have the little floaters going all around my mouth and in my teeth. At one week the dip goes too. Just though I'd share my little strategy for my first week or quitting.

Goodbye my dear friend.

We've had a good run, old friend! Remember the first few times we met? When I used to find you in my dads car and you, a few other friends and me ran off into the woods to be in each other company? Oh, the thrills, the feeling of knowing that we were not supposed to talk to you was fantastic. Even though I din't find you particularly palatable at the time, you were great!

And later on, all the parties we have been to, all the great people I had the pleasure of meting head to head, because of you!

You've been with me for 20 years now, in thick and thin. You were my reward when I did good, and you were my comfort when things wasn't all that good. 

But I think we can't be together any more. I will miss you immensely. I will feel like I have broken off my best friend for a long time ahead. But you are hurting me. You give me so much, so much pleasure, comfort, great taste experiences and the nicotine I crave. But you are also mean to me. I have done nothing to you, my oh so dear friend, but you make my lungs hurt. You make my teeth look bad, my skin look dry and you probably worsen my psoriasis. 

We need to break our relationship off. I am breaking up with you.
I would love to have you in my life, but there are so many things that gets so difficult and hard to do when you are around.

So, goodbye my long time friend, my companion. I will miss you, but it will be for the best.

I cheated

Over the weekend, I spent time drinking with a friend and smoked A cigarette. However, I'm not going to get myself down on this. 

I noticed how fast it finished. My friend offered me another one and I said no. At this point, I focused on my mouth, throat, bad breath, slight build up on my teeth, and knew that I will not be messing around with tobacco anymore. 

Its been only a week, but I feel more in control of my life than ever. I felt a little discouraged, so I stopped visiting this subreddit, but I noticed I'm at 11 days and I shouldn't reset my badge considering I have no plans on buying anymore cigarettes. 

P.S. I'm on the patch if anyone's curious.

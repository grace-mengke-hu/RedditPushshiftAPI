Going to stop after 1 year.

I wouldn't really call myself a smoker, but if someone would offer me a cigarette then I would take it. I have only owned about 7 packets of tobacco throughout the year; but other than that I am smoking about 2-3 a day. I know this may not seem like much but it is starting to give me a pain in my lungs and I'm starting to worry. I am also going to take up singing as well as I do a music course and I feel like if I stopped smoking I would have better control over my breathing. Wish me luck!

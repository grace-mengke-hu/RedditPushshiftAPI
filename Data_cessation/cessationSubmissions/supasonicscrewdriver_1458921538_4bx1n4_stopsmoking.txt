First morning as a non-smoker after 9 years on and off!

So I just started my first official day as a non-smoker; I had my last cigarette at 10:30 last night.

My morning craving was pretty bad, maybe because my patch came off over night. To get through it I read this sub, did some push ups, took a shower, and just got on with my day. It felt great to not give in.

I feel like if I can do this, I can do anything.

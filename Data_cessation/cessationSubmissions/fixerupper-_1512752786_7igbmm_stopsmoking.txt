Day 13, craving one last cigarette?

21, smoking daily since 18 up to 10ish a day. Social smoker before that. I quit 13 days ago in the middle of my second cig that day and have been craving one final cigarette the past few days. (would bum one from a friend) It sounds dumb, but I feel like it would give me closure and I’m sure I won’t buy a pack after. I don’t know I just thought I should get some kind of feedback before making the final decision.

25 years old - health benefits if i stop now

Hey 

I am 25 years old, and have decided to quit smoking.I never considered my self a smoker, because, it was social smoking. But this last year, itÂ´s been more consistent, even though i probaly only smoked about 3 cigarets a day, I realised I headed the wrong direction. So i wanted to know if anyone have some knowledge of how much damage i have done already, to my health, cancer is my biggest concern. 

25 years old 
Social smoking for the last 3 years 
And the last year, has probaly been more consistent with 3 cigarettes a day on average.

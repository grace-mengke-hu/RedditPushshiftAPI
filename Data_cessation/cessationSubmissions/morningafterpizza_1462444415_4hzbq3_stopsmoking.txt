33 Days from my 1yr anniversary. Its bittersweet, /vent.

I'm drun k as I type this out. It's been almost a year, holy crap. Almost a year, 11 months ago I smoked half a pack to a pack a day at a job i hated, Ive been through money struggles and tests of my will like small fights, big fithts with my wife to be, but I/We worked throught it. Ive had my cravings, hell I stared at the cigg vending machine at work for about 15 minutes one night after a really shitty night. But with the help of my best fiend who quit with me, I told myself, "fuck y ou marlboro, you dont control me anymore) and i went outside to be alone. Driving and smoking used to be my LIFE. I went for a 2 hour drive today and was zen. It was great. I crave them every day, everyone does i imagine, i was down at the river and my frind was smoking, whichi dont mind, but the thought came accross, this would be a great time for a smoke. It doestn control me anymore though, im free.

sorry for the drunk rank, i just checked by badge, and wow.

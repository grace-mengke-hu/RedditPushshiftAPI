The 'Nostalgic craving' post got me thinking....

This might be long and confusing, but I'll try to make it make sense in the end. 

As a middle schooler, I had this 'best friend' situation where I spent all my waking time with or talking to this person. It was that inseparable, actually sort of obnoxious friendship that 13-14 year old girls have.  After around 2 years, we had a falling out. We never really got back into contact with one another.  I still think about her often, and definitely get nostalgic about our friendship, but I've never really felt I 'needed' to reach out to her. I've accepted that we were once very close, and that now, we simply are people we used to know and I may never talk to her again. 

I think that nostalgic cravings for cigarettes are similar, in that my heart twinges when I think of either situation.  I know I had many happy memories both with that friend and as a smoker, and when I'm down or stressed, my mind likes to hearken back to things that made me happy. I know I'll always have fond feelings when I think back to my time as a smoker, but I'm learning to be okay with the fact that cigarettes are just another thing I used to know, but will never reach out to again.

I'm sorry I know this subreddit is more suited for people trying to give up real cigarettes. But I have been trying to give up vaping and be nicotine free for months now. So please someone help me I bought a disposable vape and haven't smoked it yet. It's been about an hour and I've been crying somewhat. But I just miss my Nicotine hits so much. I need help what do I do???!! This my birth Month and I don't know if I can get through it Without vaping. I just hate it SO FUCKING MUCH!!!

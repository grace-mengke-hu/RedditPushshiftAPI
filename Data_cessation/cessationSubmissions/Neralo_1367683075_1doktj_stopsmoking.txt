2 weeks.

So before I knew it, it's been 2 weeks. I haven't had cravings at the times I used to have them (generally an hour after getting out of bed and every hour after that). In fact, I didn't have cravings at all till just today when I met one of my old smoking buddies. 

He saw me coming and waved me over, and since he is ("was" really, but i'll get to that) a friend, I went over to say hi. After all, I hadn't spoken to him in ages.. Soon as I got near, he pulled put his pack and offered me a stick, and I have to say, I really thought about it. But common sense prevailed, so I refused. 

He asked me in a joking tone if I'd quit. When I told him yeah, I was quitting, he laughed. Said there's no point joking, just smoke. I said really, no, I can feel how much better I am since stopping the habit, so I was never gonna light up again, and that Hey, he should stop too. He promptly laughed in my face, said he can quit anytime, he just chooses to smoke cos he likes it, then called me a wet towel and told me to fuck off. 

So I guess the truth really hurts eh. I thought I could find a buddy to quit with so we could maybe support each other. No such luck. 

Anyways, 2 weeks down, here's looking forward to 3.

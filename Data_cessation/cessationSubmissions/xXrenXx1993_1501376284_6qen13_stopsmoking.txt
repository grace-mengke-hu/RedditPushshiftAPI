Advice for a newcomer?

Hi everyone. Reading through all the posts on here and hearing other people's experiences has been very enlightening and a good preview into what I may experience 

Here goes. I'm quitting on Monday, guys!! I linked myself in with Quitline and have decided that patches and gum may be the  way to go for me. Come 4pm on Monday I'm throwing my smokes and ashtray out! I'm going to give it all I have to get through this, no reservations. 

Does anyone have any advice or tips? 

Also I live in Brisbane Australia and would love a quit buddy who either wants to quit with me or has already quit and is able to talk me through those god forsaken moments! If you think you are able to do this please pm me. 

Thanks guys!!

Ps I'm so excited and scared at the same time 

Edit: thought I should add I've been a HEAVY smoker since 15, I'm now 24

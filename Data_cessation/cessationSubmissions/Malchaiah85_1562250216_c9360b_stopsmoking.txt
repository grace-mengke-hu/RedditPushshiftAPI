Day 13 smoke free!

Itâ€™s been hard for sure. I decided to buy a vaper on day 5. Best decision ever. It helps so much with those cigs you actually enjoyed (with a beer watching a game, working on a project with a cup of coffee, the one after dinner, etc). I feel incredible: food taste great, swimming / jogging / gym is a whole new experience (almost feel like an actual athlete lol). Even just talking is different, or tying up the shoelaces. Hope it continues this way!

Life is precious

Wow have I had some INTENSE cravings probably due to a rollercoaster of emotions. My beautiful peaceful country was attacked yesterday. I will not use this as an excuse to give in ... I  feel extra grateful to be alive today, to still have choices and chances. I am immensely saddened and my heart is heavy but I am so so privileged to have lungs that breathe.

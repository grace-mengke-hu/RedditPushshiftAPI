Time to get a badge again; addiction cycle

Hey guys,

I had a realization today.  I've been nicotine withdrawing for a month, and have slipped back into this whole "social smoking" nonsense and I've started to smoke weed again but I'm dealing with that somewhat separately.  

It has to stop.  It has to fucking stop right now.  I don't have anymore time for this stupid bullshit in my life.  I feel like I'm finally figuring out who I am and I'm running back to the drugs and cigarettes to give myself a sense of normality, as a kind of shelter from this hard and intense process of self-discovery.  

I don't want to be a smoker.  I don't want to use drugs.  Neither contributes to the kind of person I want to be and I've known this for a while.  So now, it's time to stop the addiction cycle right now.  

I think one of the scary things is that I really don't know if in a year, I'll still be on the path I'm on right now, the place I need to be to be happy, or if I'll still be mixed up in this shit.  Hell, I don't know if in a month I still won't have smoked.  I really think so on this one, but jeez!  What the fuck did I get myself into with all of this?

Anyway, new badge, day 1.  Right now I believe in myself enough to make the change, and I hope that if I do enough work on myself, I can feel like this pretty much all the time and realize how utterly beneath me opting for substance abuse/dependency is.

Day 1 I notice a complete lack of concentration

Hello, I've finally made my decision to quit smoking after about 7 months. It's not that long, but I'd rather deal with this vice sooner rather than later. About 9 hours ago I had my last cig, but as a university student this lack of concentration is awful! Any techniques to regain concentration to focus during lectures/exams

Edit: Thanks for the replies and kind words! I"ll keep at it!

My motivation. Show me some support.

I'm picking up my new (to me) car tomorrow. I don't want to smoke in this car, but driving is one of my huge triggers to smoke. I feel if I can curb this trigger I can stop smoking for good. I'm 34 and have been smoking since my 18th birthday. Please help me out. I need some support in my struggle.

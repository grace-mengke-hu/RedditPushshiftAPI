Been lurking for a while, decided that I need to quit thinking about it and do something about it. I have decided to quit. Oh man, please let this time work.

I am so tired of trying to quit and failing every dang time. I am bruised and battered from falling off of the nicotine wagon so many times. This is the only method I have not tried yet, so here goes. I am nervous about publicly stating this as now that I have said it out loud, I feel a certain pressure to live up to my word. I am hoping that by doing it here with support, it will give my hubby a break (my main support) and help motivate me. So when I get up tomorrow, I will officially become a non-smoker.  (I hope, maybe, I will)

I passed a milestone

Hello all, 

May 25 was my last cigarette. I'm taking Chantix. I've just been following the rules trying to not think about the drama or inner turmoil of quitting. One foot in front of the next. One day at a time. 

The hard times I've had I've identified as when I give myself permission to smoke. For whatever reason comes up there might always be times of wanting to smoke. Giving myself permission is crossing a line. If a cigarette had been available, I may have done it. 

I left a restaurant recently and had the thought that I'd like to smoke. This is not uncommon. I think it through and imagine that taste on my mouth. EWWW! NASTY! DISGUSTING! And usually that's the end of it. This time I acknowledged how nasty it tastes and still wanted one. Then, surprisingly, I thought no. I don't smoke anymore. I'm an ex smoker. A nonsmoker. 

That thought almost brought me to tears. I'm 54. I've smoked for 40 years. Many of those I enjoyed. I can't breathe. I can't go run with my dogs. I have blocked arteries. I'm scared. But for today I DON'T SMOKE! 

 I think I could quit the Chantix and still be ok. I committed to three months, so I will honor that. One more month. 

I just wanted to share a huge milestone. Me thinking of myself as a nonsmoker is huge. No more giving myself permission.

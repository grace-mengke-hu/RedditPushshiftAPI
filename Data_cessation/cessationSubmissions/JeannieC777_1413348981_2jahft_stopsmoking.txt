Ugh!

Here I am - almost 5 weeks smoke free. I feel like 90% of the people I see on a day to day basis aren't supportive. This group is the 10% of my interaction that is responsible for 90% of my success. My non smoking husband has been so nonchalant about my success. I've smoked almost evey day since I've met him 7 years ago... Although I take my success day to day... I expected more cheerleading.... He was even late from work on my month quit date; I thought maybe he was getting flowers or SOMETHING to make my accomplishment ...... Nothing. He didn't even know... I told him ;( ...... I'm just really upset today. Craved for second or two but nah... Still so proud of myself and I guess that's all that matters...maybe it's the rainy day

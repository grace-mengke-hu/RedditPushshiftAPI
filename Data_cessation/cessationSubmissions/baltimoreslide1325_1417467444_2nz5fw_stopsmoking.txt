[Club 31] person here!

I've been mainly quit for a while but have been doing this stupid thing where I smoke while drinking. It's dumb, and it's stopped me from ever going a full month without smoking. Never, not since I started 10 years ago! So December is it.    
Thanks to all of you other December quitters! Let's do it!
I am also not drinking this month--I just really wanna do the holidays without the wine-drenching thing they often turn into in my circle, have a fuller detox from everything--just feels like time. Plus it'll make nonsmoking easier.  
If anyone else wants to get in on this: join us for non-smoking throughout all 31 days of December!  
Yay, dudes, let's do it.

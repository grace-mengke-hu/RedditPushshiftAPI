cravings suuuuuuuuuuuuck

I haven't smoked a cigarette since February, and even then I was a pretty light smoker (1 a day for about three months), but I've just had the worst cravings lately. It's not even the nicotine that I want, it's the ritual of the thing. Packing the tobacco, lighting it, feeling the weight between my fingers. It sucks. I don't want to go back to smoking because I know I'll form a habit, but all I want to do right now is go for a night walk and smoke.

help!

Noticing More Self Respect

Good day, everyone! I just wanted to pop in to mention another "side effect" to quitting I noticed...more self respect. Kind of strange how before, I would allow myself to be walked all over by others, probably due subconsciously to the disrespect I showed MYSELF by smoking. 

Just this morning, I gave someone who's grown used to getting her way with me where to "stick it." Maybe it's because I'm still "nic fitting," but she was genuinely shocked to see this new, confident side of me. It's funny how people react when you finally say "no" to them. 

I've realized that quitting smoking is very much a "selfish" act. But what's wrong with that? We've all grown up being taught that selfishness is bad, and usually it is. But we're talking about the fight of our lives here! So yes...I'm being selfish right now. I'm putting me first, so everyone else and their unrealistic demands can simply wait. And if they have a problem with that, they can go bleep themselves.

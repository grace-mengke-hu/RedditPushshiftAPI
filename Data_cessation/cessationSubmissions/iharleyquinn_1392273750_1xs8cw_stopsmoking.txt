Looking for an accountability buddy to help me quit.

I would like to have someone who wants to quit with some support. Shooting a message to a buddy to keep up on their progress, and vice versa.


I have been smoking for 3 years, quit for 3 months last year, and want to quit smoking for a few reasons.

-I had started coughing to the point I couldn't breathe. I went to the doctor, only to find out I now have asthma

-I lost my uncle to throat cancer, which was caused by smoking

-I want to get fit (I'm not heavy, just out of shape. I can barely run, not only because of my asthma, because when I did quit, I was able to run without coughing until I almost passed out)

I would really appreciate if someone would do this with me. PM me for my username on kik (I prefer this to giving out my cell number)

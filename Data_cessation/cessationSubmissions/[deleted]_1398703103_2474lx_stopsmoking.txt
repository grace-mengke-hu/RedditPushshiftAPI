Hey there, quitters. Glad you're out there. How in god's name do I make this work?

I'm not going to bore you with my story or anything, I'm sure you're all familiar. But seriously, after ten years it feels like it's less a habit and more a self-medication for a full-blown mental/emotional disorder. I go fucking nuts when I quit. All the crazy comes out. And it lasts a lot longer than 3 days, too. I've pretty much accepted that I'll die young at this point. I don't want to, though. Advice?

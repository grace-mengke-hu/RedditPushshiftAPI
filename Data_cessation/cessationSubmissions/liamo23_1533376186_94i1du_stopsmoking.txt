One month

So itâ€™s been a month today for me since I quit smoking!! I ended up buying a package last night I canâ€™t seem to make it pass the month mark is that common ?? I have reset my date again for Monday and continue on or will I keep going with my former plan.. why is it so damn hard ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜¤

Grrr

So I have been telling myself that I have to quit for a long time now. Then, I finally just got tired of it and decided to quit this morning. Now, I've tried in the past and failed but for some reason I feel as though this time will be different. That is where you all come in. I am wondering a couple things, how long will the nicotine take to get out of my system. I was a pack or just over a pack a day smoker for almost 10 years now. Next, any tips on how to fight these damn cravings... They are making me want to punch my computer screen. Also, I am an elementary school teacher so I need to figure out a way to not go crazy. Any other tips would be really helpful. I really am determined this time and will quit.

25 Day Victory!

It may not seem like a big deal to many, but to me, what happened last night was a HUGE success and was happy that I was both physically and psychologically able to move past the desire for a cigarette.

My good friend had her birthday at the MECCA of outdoor smoking bars last night. I knew it would be a test. I kept it all to myself in hopes that I would be able to move effortlessly through the night without a cigarette.

Not only did I not smoke 1 single cigarette but I also DID NOT EVEN WANT ONE. This is the first time in many tries to quit smoking that I have not craved a cigarette while surrounded by other smokers and while drinking beer simultaneously.

I am so happy that my brain wasn't a scumbag last night. That I'm beating this addiction. That this is going to be the time where it sticks and I will never go back.

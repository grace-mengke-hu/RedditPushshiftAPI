Question about EasyWay (Allen Carr)

It's Day 7/8 now for me and I've only just discovered EasyWay by Allen Carr. It has helped pretty considerably - even though the whole thing sounds so.. too good to be true as you read his book. I just have a question:

EasyWay essentially attempts to make your brain learn that you are not giving up anything, because smoking never gave you anything in the first place (I'm only about 1/4 through the main bulk of the book). I get it, it's great, but does this really work in the long term? The problem I had in the first instance was ignoring craving in the long term!

Also... It's been 1 week WOO

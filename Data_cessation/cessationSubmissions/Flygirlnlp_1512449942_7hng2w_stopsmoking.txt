Coughing never ends

I smoked for over 20 years and stopped a few weeks back because I was coughing and feeling like crap and was just tired of all of it.  When I think I used to plan my life around smoke breaks, I realize how jacked my priorities were.   I am thoroughly enjoying all the super cool stuff that is happening since I’ve stopped and truly don’t miss it, but this cough still has me scared. There’s crap in there and it was there before I stopped smoking.  My plan was to hold out going to the doctor until after the new year so I’d have more time under my belt but I go online and get myself upset.  Does the black/grey stuff eventually stop coming up?

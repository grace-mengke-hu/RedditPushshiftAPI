Need some reassurance.

Last time I managed to quit it was for four months. I dealt with a nasty breakup and ended up breaking my foot where I got to sit around all summer and dwell on things that aren't important. I've been smoking again for about 3 months and could use some reminders from those who quit of how good it feels? 

I started smoking in 2010 and have had tomorrow as my designated quit day for about a week now.

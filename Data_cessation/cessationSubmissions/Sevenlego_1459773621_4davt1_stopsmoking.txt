1000 hours!!!!

Just remember you can do it!!! 16 years and right before quit time it was up to a pack and a half a day. I never thought I could do it. But it's so freeing! I don't have to worry about who smells me and if I can sneak away to get my fix. I'm more confident around people now. When you're truly ready to quit you can quit. Keep it up!!!

13 days and sixteen hours in. One question.

Last night I went to a concert. This is one of my biggest triggers. I knew I was going to be miserable if I didn't have a smoke. So I grabbed a disposable e-cig. I talked it over with my girlfriend and for special occasions it seems to be a good alternative. What do you guys think?

Going out tonight and feeling determined!

I've "quit" literally every other week for the past year and a half. I feel much more determined in this latest attempt and I feel like I'm almost over the quitting hump (I quit for six years in the past, so I kind of know what this process feels like when it's successful). I'm getting drug out to the bar tonight by the GF, and while I feel very determined to stay smoke-free, I wouldn't mind having some thoughts in my mind to knock back the inevitable cravings.

Stop cravings weeks after quitting?

I stopped smoking the day my Christmas break started. It was tough but I feel like it's tougher now whenever I see someone smoking or see smoking in movies or tv. I feel like it would be really satisfying to have another whenever there is some kind of trigger. Is there any way to stop this or will this occur for the rest of my life?

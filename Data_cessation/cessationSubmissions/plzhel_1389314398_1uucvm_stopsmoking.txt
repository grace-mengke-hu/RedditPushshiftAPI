Why can I stop smoking at one place and not the other?

When I'm at my parents place I can go weeks without smoking and not miss it at all. I don't do it there out of respect to them but as soon as I get home wether it's been one day or month since my last cigarette I go buy a pack immediately. I can't help myself. Any advice on how to stay off them when I go home this time?
Thanks.

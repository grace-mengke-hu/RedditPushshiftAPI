First time drinking since quitting... and no urge for a smoke!

After starting and finishing Allen Carr's book on Friday, I decided it was time that I was officially a non smoker!!!

Yesterday I went to the bar with some work friends since quitting, and was the first time I had a drink... and being on the patio with everyone around me smoking, I had no urge to smoke... I read this subreddit every day, and each post just inspires and motivates to stay strong!

The time has come, after "just" 4 years of smoking

Hi,
so at the age of 27 and after 4 years of smoking 10 Marlboro lights/day I decided that it's time to cut the crap and quit smoking. It's the morning cough that was too much - I finally realized that it's directly affecting my health. I know that with my volume and smoking experience you guys think it should be fairly easy, but trust me - it's not. That's why I'm posting this to remind myself that I have to stay strong. Cross your fingers out there!

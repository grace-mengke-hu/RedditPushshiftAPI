Two Months Without a Single Puff

Just dropping by to high five and fist pound because I've been two months without a single puff!! This is huge for me. I smoked 10-20 cigarettes a day for more than ten years and smoked daily for years before I was nearing a pack a day.

I often felt miserable from smoking. Hearing my own breathing while trying to fall asleep, having dreams about being short of breath and likely experiencing some sleep apnea. If I had to jog a block to catch the bus my face would be flush and I'd be breathing heavy. Worse yet, breaking away from work, fun and friends every 45 minutes to go smoke. Spending too much mental energy figuring out when and where I could smoke without colleagues thinking I was a total bum. Nice not to take self inflicted shame showers all the time! Oh, and I might mention that I smelled awful. It's really hard to believe until you quit, but I am shocked when smokers get on the bus how strongly they smell.

So, I made it here by being miserable for a long time and knowing I needed to stop. I tried many many times and failed. I'm not out of the woods yet, I know. I used the patch up until this past weekend. It really really helped me. In the past, I've used the patch to get over the first couple of days and then went cold turkey. This time, I followed the whole course from Step 3 down and I'm glad I did. For those considering it, if you've tried to quit before and cold turkey didn't work for you, try the patch w/ some nicotine gum or something to fill in the bad cravings for the first few weeks.

One of the best things so far has been taking flights across the country and not having to stress about not being able to smoke. So nice to just relax!

Reading this sub helped me stay motivated these last two months. I'm going to keep coming back so I can stay quit. Thanks all for sharing the struggles and stories. There is no benefit to smoking!

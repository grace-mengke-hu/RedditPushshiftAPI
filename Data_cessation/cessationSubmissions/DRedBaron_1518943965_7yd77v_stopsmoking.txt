Just passed the 2 months mark - still having trouble concentrating - Ideas?

Cigarettes helped me clear my thoughts during my job whenever I needed to solve something.
Now, 2 months into quitting and although I still go on breaks - Its not the same.
My mind still feel blurry and I can't concentrate on a task for more than 10 minutes..
Any suggestions?

So I relapsed today...

I had a calculus exam and bought a pack beforehand to deal with my nerves. I lit one up after and a girl I had been flirting with saw me smoking. Based on the look she gave me, I lost whatever shot I had.

This is a case where I took a health risk and forgot about the social risk altogether. Remember /r/stopsmoking , this is a polarizing habit and to some it's a deal breaker. I wish you better luck than I.

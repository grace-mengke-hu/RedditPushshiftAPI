Just over a week without smoking and my easiest time quitting yet.

I've struggled with quitting, as many as you have, for years. 



Then last week, I just decided I was done while I was smoking the last cigarette in my pack. No cutting down. No vape. Nothing. I was just done.


There were only two times this week I almost had a smoke. But I held in there. And I'm so glad.



I know it's still early on in the process, but the worst is behind me. Haven't had a craving today at all. It's mostly psychological at this point and I want this so badly that I know I'm going to do just fine. 



Tomorrow I'm going to be finding a new way fulfill my marijuana habit. Not sure if I'll try edibles or what, but I feel silly quitting smoking nicotine but still burning pot leaves to suck into my lungs. Does anyone know if those vaporizers make pot smoke safe?


I think what made the difference this time is that I didn't let myself use any excuses. None at all. It feels good.

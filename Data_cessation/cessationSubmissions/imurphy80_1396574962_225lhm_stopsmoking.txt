Day 1

Today marks my first 24 hours without a cigarette in 17 years!  I'm also on day 16 of Chantix. I have had no real effects from it as some of my friends have; no nausea no dreams no mood swings.  Perhaps it is working perhaps it's not, but today at 2300 I will be 24 hours free.

I've even added my triggers: 
Drove home from work, no cigarettes! 
Drank beer, no cigarettes (but lots of cravings!)
I have a half pack beside me, just trying my willpower. 

This time, I will succeed!

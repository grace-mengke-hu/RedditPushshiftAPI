How to celebrate Not Smoking

Ask a smoker to bum a cigarette, then break it in half in front of them. Repeat. 

But in reality, I've learned everyday not smoking is a celebration. I feel amazing, I have taken the lessons I learned quitting and applied them to my life. I was standing around a smoker yesterday, and I felt bad for them, to be a slave to the nicotine.

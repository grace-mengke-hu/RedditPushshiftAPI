Well, hey folks. Day 1.

Here's the thing. I've quit twice this year for almost thirty days each time. In the end I foolishly bought a pack both times just cause : "eh, whatever". So I know I have to change my attitude and get serious. 
Another attitude/maturity thing : looking ahead, there are concerts coming up that I know I'll want to drink at, and buying a pack before will seem trivial, and part of the party. How do I party without cigarettes? 
Also, I have a calculus 2 midterm on what will be my day 2... Yikes 

I'm actually quite confident that the "1 cigarette" thing doesn't work for me, get me back to smoking immediately. But it seems that one puff doesn't fit into the quitting equation. 

I'm excited. I can feel my lungs going in turbo time right now. I can't wait to run.

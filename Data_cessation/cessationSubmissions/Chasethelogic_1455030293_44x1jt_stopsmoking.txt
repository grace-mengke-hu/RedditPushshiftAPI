It's been one year

Hi there r/stopsmoking.

I've never been to this sub or much less even knew about it until today.  Today is a milestone in my life.  As the title would have you assume, today marks the one year anniversary of breaking my smoking habit.  At my peak, I wasn't smoking as much as a heavy smoker, but I was at about 2 packs a week.... those sweet, sweet Turkish Royals.  It got to the point where I was tired of the way my breath smelled, how my clothes always reeked, how I had to go outside at some places, how my schedule depended on consuming those little sticks, and how I would get out of breath after a brisk, active burst.  

  I quit cold turkey.  No patches, no lozenges, no gum, no vapes... I just said enough.  If I had any advice to all of you who are serious, it would be this.  The fact that your conscious being wants to quit smoking because you know its bad for you is all you need.  Do not depend on patches or anything else unless it is truly working for you.  I feel like substituting one addiction for another isn't really the best way to go.  I repeatedly told all my friends about different milestones: 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months. They always congratulated me and made me feel like accomplished something.  After a while, the pride in yourself starts to grow.  The triggers disappear, your smell and taste come back, and those occasional "I've had some drinks and just one cigarette sounds great" moments go away.  

I don't know any of you or what you're going through, but you can do it.  Do it for your family who want you to stay healthy and alive longer.  Do it for your friends who don't want to see you have a crutch on something so bad.  Do it for yourself because there is no logic in the world that can summoned to defend how much better life is without cigarettes.  Good luck to you all.

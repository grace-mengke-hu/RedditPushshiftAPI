E-cig

Just looking for advice on the e-cig.  I had purchased it before this quit, but had juice with nicotine in it. When I decided I was going to quit I armed myself with NRT patches and nicotine free juice for the e-cig. I only used the patch a few days and decided to stop...so my question is, in the event of a strong craving, could I use the nicotine free e-cig. I am determined to give up nicotine as I have already noticed improvement in my health.  I'm thinking this would help get through the hard times and keep my system free of nicotine.

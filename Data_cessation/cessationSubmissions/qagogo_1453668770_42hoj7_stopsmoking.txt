Screw, Full Moon Lunacy! I'm not smoking and keeping this star!

I've had the most stressful 36 hours of my quit and have never wavered. EVERYTHING that could have gone wrong at work yesterday did, including a number of things that I didn't even know existed. My abusive, narcissist, alcoholic older sister was hospitalized (again), almost locked up after falsely accusing the boyfriend she's living with of physical abuse (not the first time she's done that), and threatened to charge my elderly father with battery when he said he was going to pick her up from the bf's house this morning. She, and the insane, messy, terrifying fallout that follows in her wake, is by far my biggest trigger to smoke. I would normally go out and buy a pack of cigarettes to help "deal" while my family implodes waiting for her to resurface, hoping that she doesn't fall down and hit her head in  the middle of the street (again), show up in a hospital (again), or in lockup (again), or worry that this time is the time she'll show up in the morgue. She abused me and the rest of my family her entire adult life (and much of her adolescence). I'm not going to allow her actions be an excuse to abuse myself with cigarettes. Sorry for the wall of crazy; I was planning a positive text for my first month. The universe had other plans. Thanks for reading. Join in me in not smoking today!

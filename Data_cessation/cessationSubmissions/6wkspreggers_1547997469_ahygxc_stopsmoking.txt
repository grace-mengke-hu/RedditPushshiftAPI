What are some healthy habits to replace smoking?

So, I'm pregnant. Found out 3 days ago and have since reduced to 2 fags daily. Someone suggested going outside for an apple when you feel like lighting one up, and I feel that might help. Anything else you might suggest please? I have university exams coming up next week and I know I'll be stressed and craving like mad. Help!

Just got diagnosed with stable angina.

I've been smoking a pack a day for the last 4 years now. I'm in the military and in some ways smoking is apart of the culture despite our leadership's best efforts to discourage it. I started experiencing intense pain in my chest and it really freaked me out, went to the doctor today and they diagnosed with stable angina. They stated that my vitals were actually good considering my usage of tobacco, but suggested I quit. I have access to patches and I've quit before, but smoking is such a strong social habit in my day-to-day activities that I'm not sure if I can quit. I get on shift and go out for a smoke, during the day we'll go out and discuss our plan of actions at the smoke pit. In social settings smoking can actually help meet people. It's such a intertwined part of my daily life, I'm not sure how I can quit. I can't even imagine driving my car without smoking, it just seems so boring. My doctor told me last time I tried to quit that I had to *want* to quit to be successful. The honest truth is I don't want to. I enjoy the act of smoking, but now it's legitimately affecting my health in a very noticeable way. How can I get motivated to quit when it's such a strong force in my social life?

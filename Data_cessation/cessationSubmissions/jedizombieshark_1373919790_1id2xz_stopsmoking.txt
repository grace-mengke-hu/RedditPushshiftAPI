Temptation is blinding

As I'm walking to a the mosque I stop to check my shoelaces; between my feet I spot one crisp,dry, mint condition Marlboro Red cigarette. I look around to see if anyone's watching and I pick it up and put it in my pocket *"Alas, a reward for my good behavior. Just one cigarette, maybe only a few puffs, and then I keep moving on with my life."* I told myself. We finish the prayer and I go home and place the cigarette in my cupboard to *"save it for a special occasion"*, maybe my 20th day smokefree, the end of Ramadan, my birthday, etc. At this moment I feel great and there is no doubt in my mind that I am doing the right thing. 

But then I get to thinking... I take a deep breath and really think.I thought about all those times I stayed awake debating whether to go to the gas station to buy a pack and choosing to sleep off the cravings. I thought about all those days I went to workout so I can turn my life around. I thought about the promises I made to myself, my family, and my friends. I thought about all the money I wasted and all of the good times I could have had without the urge to smoke driving me crazy. I went into my cupboard, and looked at that little white and brown stick, that seemingly harmless killer, I snapped it in half and I flushed it down the toilet. 

Never think you're punishing yourself for not smoking, it's quite the opposite you are REWARDING yourself. Never think "just one won't hurt" because one crack in a dam can lead to a flood. Don't let temptation blind you, and most importantly take a deep breath and **think before you act**

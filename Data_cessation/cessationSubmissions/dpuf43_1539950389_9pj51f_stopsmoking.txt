A short replacement activity for an outside smoking break?

Feel free to skip the first paragraph, just an introduction.

I had (still have a bit) a bronchitis or a flu or something that affected my respiratory system. It seemed to heal fine if it weren't for the partying days when I had smoked. Always the next day I was back to square one and even worse actually. So I decided to kick it for a while, full quitting seems the perfect solution but I don't want to make too big of a commitment or count days so that if I should have the occasional cigarette (hopefully not) in a jacuzzi or something in a drunken state, it doesn't feel like a full relapse or a total failure. I'm about 2 weeks in (have smoked for 12 years) and surprisingly haven't had almost any cravings this time, I do have some nicotine gum with me but I've only used it a couple of times.

I do miss the taking a break and going outside for 5-10 minutes part though. Especially in the morning to feel the wind/sun etc, watch people do their thing. I was wondering if you might have a suggestion what to do outside instead of smoking in about the same timeframe. Walking etc is good but I do it already, I mean just for a moment to recollect. Just standing around doing nothing seems weird. Sorry for the rambling and thanks for your time!

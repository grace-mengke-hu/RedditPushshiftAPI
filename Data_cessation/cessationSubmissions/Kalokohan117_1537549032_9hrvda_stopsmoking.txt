Stopping question, I'm little scared

I just recently decrease my cigarette consumption (Marlboro Red/Classic) from 10 sticks/day to 2 sticks/day and I'm already suffering from shortage of breath to the point that I feel my head and extremities are numbing and going to pass out. Reading some of the posts here seem to be that it is an anxiety attack.    
    
If I'm to just sleep it out during those period, can I survive?

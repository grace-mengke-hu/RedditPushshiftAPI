Let's hate the world just a bit more

I've been smoking for almost 6 years now. (Also I JUST realized I've been smoking for 6 years. Damn that's a long time. Didn't expect that.)
I roll my own cigarettes. *Cheaper. More effective*. (in both ritualistic suicide and oh-god-delicious-smoke)
   
I'm in the middle of exams (which are all going terribly so far) and a few hours ago I found out that I'm all out of tobacco. Also out of cash. 
Figured I might as well quit now. 

The hatred starts now.



I would just like to mention that my captcha was EFUKDF, which is pretty much how I feel already.

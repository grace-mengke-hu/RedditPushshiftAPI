Any tips for staying "regular"

I've tried to cease smoking before, and by far the most dramatic withdrawal symptom for me is an inability to move bowel. The Five Day Plan recommends avoiding coffee and tea which I would usually get some "assistance" from but in my experience these in the absence of nicotine are insignificant to my end.

I don't have any GI problems or strange eating habits, I'm just so horribly addicted to nicotine. halp pls

btw can you find all the butt puns

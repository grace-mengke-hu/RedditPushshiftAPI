Just quit out of nowhere, let's see how it goes.

I have never even thought about quitting and I have smoked a pack a day for ten years. Suddenly at tuesday morning as I was walking to work and smoking, I just thought fuck it this feels like shit and threw the cig away and haven't smoked since. I keep a pack in my pocket out of habbit and because I think it's easier to be without smoking knowing that I could do it anytime. I wrote the date on my (hopefully) last pack. Everytime I have cravings I take a couple of pastilles. Last night was hard as I was out drinking with my friends and they all smoke, but I made it! I haven't told anyone I quit, not even my girlfriend, because I think that would jinx it and put pressure on me. Let's see when she notices. I wanted to share this with someone and this is the perfect place! Wish me luck!

Giving it another try

I'm currently sweating my ass off in class, because I had to walk a half mile from my car to the classroom. I had "quit" for 5 weeks, but after a stumble at the gas station, I bought a pack. Three/four weeks later, I'm back where I started: tired, no appetite, out of my usually solid shape, and a pain stuck in my chest because I just want to cough my lungs out. 

So this morning I smoked my last cigarette. I'm giving it another go, I'm going to be a non-smoker. I just hope it lasts more than last time. When I get home, I'm restarting my tag counter, throwing the rest of the pack in the trash, and disposing of the cigarette butts that litter across my back porch. I might work out today... But right now, I just want to be done with these things. After three years, they've worn out their welcome.

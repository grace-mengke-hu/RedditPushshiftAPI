I'm so done

I started smoking because it was cool. There's no other way of looking at this, I've been smoking since I was 17 and I'm disgusted with myself. I had three cigarettes left and I was making such a huge ordeal of flushing them it was revolting. I know why people look down on me for smoking, it's annoying as hell, but the shame of smoking is so sublime. It makes me feel like I'm a part of something outside of myself, but that doesn't mean I should continue it. Just because our "struggle is real" doesn't mean we can't support each other in other ways.

I've been on this sub since I was probably 18, but it's been three freaking years. It's time to put up or shut up. Cold turkey is going to be the only way I can stop this and maybe I can start growing in other ways as well. Thanks for reading this whoever is out there. I know I'll need all the support I can get

Withdrawals and euphoria

I don't smoke about sixty percent of the time. I'll start for a few weeks here and there and smoke a couple of packs a week, depending on how much time I spend driving.  I was a pack a day smoker years ago.

This last time around I smoked daily for a month.  Today was my first full day without and I feel like a dynamo. This seems to happen every time I "quit."  When I stop for a few days I always wind up doing some task I've been putting off for a while and feel great about it.  I don't feel more agitated.  I want a cigarette but not to the point where I'm upset about it.

This is a weird thing I've noticed in contrast to every other smoker I've talked to about quitting.  I don't know if quitting smoking just comes because of an upswing in my sense of well-being or causes a feeling of euphoria, but it seems to happen every time I stop.  Am I alone in this?

PS; I don't want to minimize the struggle some of you have with withdrawals and I congratulate you on your effort at changing your lives for the better.

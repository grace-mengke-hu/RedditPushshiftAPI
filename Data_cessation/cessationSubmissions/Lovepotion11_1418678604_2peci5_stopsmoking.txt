Oh, hey there, tastebuds!

I know that this is super early, but I drink this green tea every single day.  The past little while it has started tasting boring and bland, I thought maybe I was just getting used to it or something. 

Had a cup this afternoon, oh wow, it actually tastes like taste again!! 

Yay for recovering taste buds :)

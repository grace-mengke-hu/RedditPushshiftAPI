Day 1.

Hey guys, I just posted in a sub on r/all about wanting to quit smoking and got directed here. 

I started with mokes (part weed part tobacco) about 3 years ago, and since moving home have switched to cigarettes because it's a lot less ground on than marijuana (neither of which I'm proud of.)

Anyways, I've decided that I want to stop smoking. I hope to learn from all of you, as well as become part of the community. Today is day 1, and although I know it will be difficult, I hope that I am able to stay strong.

A doubtful quitter question

So I quit 3 days ago and things are going great so far, but I am starting to question myself. I just can't see myself without a cigarette, the beer with friends, the partying etc. So my question is, how do I get rid of this feeling that my joyful experiences in life will be incomplete without a cig.

day 7. thanks /r/stopsmoking!

I have lurked /r/stopsmoking for a year or so, jealous of your collective commitment to a better life. This week has been a roller coaster of emotions for me, but thanks to friends, family, and David's reduced sodium sunflower seeds I remain strong. Thanks again guys and gals.

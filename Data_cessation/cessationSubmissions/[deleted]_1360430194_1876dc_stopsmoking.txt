Drunk Smoking

I know the point of this subreddit is total cessation, but I've had an experience that I want to share.

It hasn't been long (about one week, my flair thingy is off because I'm about 15 hours off from the bot time I think), and I'm definitely still drunk, but I just got home and noticed the stench of tabacco all over my shirt. I smoked quite a bit at the bar (basically as if I hadn't quit smoking), but now that I'm home I think its kind of gross. 

It felt great at the time and I don't regret it at all, but it didn't spark the addiction again. I feel as though if I become a normal only-smoke when-drunk-with-friends type smoker that's fine (I'm still superduper young probably).

If I'm an idiot please tell me, but I think this is a big step for me. I didn't smoke on the cab ride home, I didn't stop at a conveni for a new pack, I don't have any cravings, and I think the smell and taste I have in my mouth now is off-putting to myself.

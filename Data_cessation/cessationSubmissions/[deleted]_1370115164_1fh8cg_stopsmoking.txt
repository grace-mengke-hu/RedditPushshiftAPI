[Day 1] It has started

Hello!  I've been a smoker since I was 15.  I am now 28 years old.  I've quit many times as I am sure many of you have.  I have quit for months on end before, but I always slipped up.  Today is the day though.

The biggest motivator is my health.  I am a single father and have to think about my son.  I never smoked around him but I am sure he knew.

Another motivator for me is dating.  I don't want to date a smoker because then I will not have the motivation to quit.  Many non-smokers do not want to date a smokers, which makes sense.

Wish me luck!

Day 1 Begins

I've been smoking for the past year and a half, and multiple times have tried quitting. Each time I've fallen back into the trap that is "oh, I can just have one" or "just this one last pack for the weekend". Not this time. I'm done for good now. I smoked my last cig at about 3:15 today. Here we go.

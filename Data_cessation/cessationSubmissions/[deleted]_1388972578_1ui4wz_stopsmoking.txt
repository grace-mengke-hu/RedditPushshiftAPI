I'm a 26 year old female who just measured high blood pressure for the second time. I'm done.

Been smoking since I was 18, and never thought I would make it this far without yet quitting. I want to be a teacher, I want to have kids, I want to live healthy, I can't smoke anymore. Having high blood pressure at 26 is a huge fucking wake up call. Smoked my last one earlier today, and cravings are starting to hit. Any support or advice is appreciated!

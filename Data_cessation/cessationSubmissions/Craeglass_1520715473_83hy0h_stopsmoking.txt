25 hours smoke free

I’m 23, started smoking at age 17. With the help of vyvanse, I managed to smoke a pack a day. 2 years off prescription meds, and now 25 hours with no cigs—I’ve never gone one day without cigs in the past 6 years of living. 

I’m using a blu e cig to help me out, ordered a Juul as well. 

People that surround me don’t understand what a band aid smoking is/was for me, and this sub reddit seems super supportive. 

Without smoking, it’s hard for me to know what to do in my free time. I didn’t realize how much time I spent sitting on my porch chain smoking! 

What’s your favorite thing about quitting cigs?

Just some dumb questions

So I've quit smoking since new years(not a resolution thats just when everything added up for me) and I guess today would be day 4. For the first two days I didn't crave it at all today is the first day I really got the cravings. So I guess my first question is when do the cravings start to decrease? Not nessasarly go away because from what I've heard they never fully go away. Also when the cravings do go away will I be able to bum a cigarette off a friend and not get hooked back on it?

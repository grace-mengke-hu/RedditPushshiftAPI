I once stopped smoking for 6 months a couple of years ago.

Things were great. Had a nice long term relationship and recently graduated from university. Then I got cheated by ex gf and things got complicated.. Out of emotional pain I started back smoking. I then bought a pack of cigarettes and smoked all 20 cigs in a short amount of time.. I even didn't liked the taste and the feeling it gave me.. I even had to throw up because of the nicotine overdose.. 

When I deal with a hell of stress That I can't handle, I get the urge to damage my health and my first choice then is smoking excessively,.. 
who else got this also??

Well long story short: I have the feeling that I'm emotionally stronger now and quitted smoking 1week ago. I don't have cravings anymore. ..
Hopefully i'll get through this...

Kudos to this sub and the quitters and for the people that want to stop smoking...: get your shit together and know that you are better than this hideous nicotine monster that keeps haunting your mind&amp;body!!

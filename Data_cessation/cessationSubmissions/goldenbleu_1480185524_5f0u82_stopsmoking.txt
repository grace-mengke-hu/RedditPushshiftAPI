[Depressing alarm]Desperately need to make my dad quit smoking. Advice needed.

So I would really like to hear from people who got others in their life to quit or were influenced by others to quit. 

My dad has been smoking for 30 years now. He lost his brother due to lung cancer about a decade ago and stopped for half a year but it came back five years ago. 

His father, (my grandpa) smoked heavily too, developed cardiac problems, and was in and out of hospital for the last ten years of his life, and he couldn't stop smoking. He was fined by the hospital multiple times for smoking inside the hospital, and he literally smoke to his death in his deathbed. I remember attending his funeral and actually feeling he is at least happy in heaven because he doesn't have to deal with addiction anymore.

It made enough of a traumatic scene for me, I never smoked, and I almost have a freak out every time I smell a whiff of cig smoke. I once had a panic attack just because one of my roommate smoked indoors. 

I left my parents home about four years ago, and became independent, so I'm in a smoker free household, but I can't shake off the fact he smokes a bit more than half a pack a day, and he is following my grandpa's path to a terrible last decade of his life.  

I threw tantrums as a kid when he smoked, he never budged. He once used to smoke indoors and I fainted couple times so he moved to smoke outdoors. As an adult I tried sending him Nicorette gum, he doesn't like the taste, says it makes his teeth sensitive. 


So a long preamble to the question: What got you to quit? What can a family member do to help them? Any help of any kind is appreciated.

A Q for Queer Quitters

I had recently been getting these smoking cessation ads targeted to LGBT folks, but I haven’t gotten them since I quit.

Let’s set aside the creepiness that the almighty Algorithm knew I quit...

Can anyone help me find the ad? I’d like to share it with some people (and maybe get some karma out of it!), since it’s the only cessation PSA that actually had any influence on me. 

It’s a bunch of people each saying a line about being queer, and some of them say a thing about quitting smoking. The people are framed against backgrounds in various colors: orange, yellow, etc.

These ads were running for me on streaming services like 2 weeks ago. Then I stopped smoking, and I can’t find them at all. 

Thanks!

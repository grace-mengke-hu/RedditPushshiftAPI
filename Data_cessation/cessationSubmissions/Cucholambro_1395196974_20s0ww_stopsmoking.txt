4 days now... What can I expect in the future?

I have started smoke cessation one month ago, reducing my cigarrettes from 20+ to 5 or 6. On friday night I smoked my last cigarrette.
I work as a teacher, and at the end of my day I have a very complicated class, so I was afraid I could not hold the anxiety, but so far I'm doing well. 
I am 27 and have smoked for more or less ten years. The longest I've been without smoking is one week, so that's my immediate goal right now. I'm taking bupropion.

My question is: what should I expect in the next days/weeks?
Thanks a lot!

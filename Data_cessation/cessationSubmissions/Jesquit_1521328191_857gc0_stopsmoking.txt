I'm gonna do It! I'm gonna beat this!

It's been almost a week, and I'm hanging in there!  I'm smoked for almost 40 years.  I've quit a few times, but I want this to be my LAST time.  Reading other people's posts makes me feel not so alone.  I'm not the only one struggling.  And people's accomplishments help make me reach for mine!

First timer

This is my first real attempt to quit smoking. On Day 10 and hoping to breeze through now...I feel like each day gets easier to say “no” and think “why would I go back?!”
I went cold turkey As I was reading Allen Carr’s book 😕. I think being super prepared for my Quit helped. I used and am still using cinnamon sticks to breathe through like a cig. It’s nice for driving or after a meal to have that something to do with hands and mimicks the motion etc of smoking. Ive been doing acupuncture and that’s helping with cravings. Also set up a dentist appointment for cleaning on Day 2. The smoke free app has been super helpful too...to see the progress encourages me 

Today I turned 41 and wish I did this a looonnnggg time ago!!

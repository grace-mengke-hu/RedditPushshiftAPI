Coughing until I vomit daily (for 6+ weeks)

When will the cough go away? I've slept only a few hours per night since I quit (1/3/13), because I'm coughing like I'm "about to die" all day, often making me vomit. My ribs, stomach, back, neck, and more hurt from the constant cough.

What can I do to help? Throat sprays, cough drops, gargling warm salt water, tea with honey, hydration, and steam won't help. It is seriously affecting my job, as I bartend, and I'm "coughing up a lung" every 5 seconds (it is literally that constant). How can I make it stop?

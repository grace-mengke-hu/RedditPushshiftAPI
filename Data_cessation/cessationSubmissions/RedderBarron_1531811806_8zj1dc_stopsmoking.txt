2 weeks + a few days smoke-free.

So a bit over 2 weeks ago, i finished a 40 pack of menthol cigarettes, they would last me 3-4 days. Every hour i'd be out for a puff, even in the middle of the night. Having trouble sleeping? Go out for a smoke. Cooking something? Turn down the heat and go out for a smoke. It consumed my life. For 7 years i smoked. 

I know i havent quit yet, its only been 2 weeks, but im determined to put smoking behind me. 

I've managed to replace cigarettes with vaping with 12mg e-juice but i've started mixing in no-nic e-juice at a 50-50 ratio to start weaning myself off nicotine. The hand-to-mouth motion of vaping has really helped me a lot. I know some ppl here dont like vaping but after trying gum, mints, patches, cold turkey and others this is the only one that seems to be working for me. 

I have a goal. By September i want to be down to only a few drops of nicotine e-juice per tank and by early next year down to no-nic e-juice only. 

I can already taste better, smell better, my clothes, hair &amp; skin no longer smell horrible all the time and just yesterday at work i stepped outside for a vape and smelled my coworker's cigarette smoke. I was expecting it to set off my cravings, and it did a little which is what the vape was for, but more than that, i didn't like it. It smelled terrible. 

My hopes are high, given cigarette prices in australia, i've saved maybe a couple hundred dollars already. My vape is satisfying my cravings and i have no urges to buy more. 

I'll be sure to post more updates over time. Thanks for reading.

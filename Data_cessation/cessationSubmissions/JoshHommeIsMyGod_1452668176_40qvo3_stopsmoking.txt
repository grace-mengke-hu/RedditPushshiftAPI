Well it's time I put my new year's resolution in effect and quit procrastinating. Today I never touch a cigarette again.

So I know there is going to be a long and painful road ahead of me as I have smoked since the age of 13. I am 29 now as of the 5th of January. So enough is enough, What I ask is personally with your experience of quitting. What has helped you fight the cravings? What methods did you use?

back again :)

I quit a couple years ago in June, was on here, but got a newer job that was high stress at the time (still at the company, everything is good now) and started up again in September of that year.

Just bought a house and trying to get back into my very frugal ways again. Its nearly been 24h now and I feel fine, I'm ready for the triggers to come at me again.

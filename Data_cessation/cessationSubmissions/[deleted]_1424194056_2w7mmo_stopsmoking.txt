I smoke when she's away.

I quit smoking officially last June, and I hadn't touched a cigarette up until this last Thanksgiving. 

See, I quit because my SO's mother died of lung cancer when she  was young. I felt guilty and rude to continue smoking if I was going to be with her, so I decided it was time to finally kick the habit.

But this last holiday season I finally broke. My job requires me to stay in town for the holidays, and she, as well as our roommates, left to visit family.

I was lonely, and stressed from work, and looking for any rationalization to just go ahead and buy a pack. So I did. 

Now I've created a new habit: every time she's out of town (maybe once a month or less) I end up buying a pack. Then I usually chain smoke it, or space out the cigarettes so I finish right before she gets back. She's leaving again soon, and I'm already starting to get the cravings. 

Talking about the cravings usually helps, which I would usually do with her, but she doesn't know I've been splurging when she's away. I guess I'm hoping I can use this forum for advice, as well as simply a place to talk when I'm craving a cig.

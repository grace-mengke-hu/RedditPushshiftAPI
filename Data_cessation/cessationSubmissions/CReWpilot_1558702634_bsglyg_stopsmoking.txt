Nicotine Gum Freqeuncy

Maybe this is a dumb question, but I quit vaping about 2.5 weeks ago (after using vaping to help quit a 20-year and pack/day smoking habit). I have been using the Nicorette gum to help. If you check the guidance from Nicorette, they say to chew a piece of the gum **every 1-2 hours for the entire first six weeks**. So, my question…
 
Is this more a ‘wash, rinse, **and repeat**’ type of thing, or is there a genuine reason why this is better?
 
I ask because, without it being an deliberate effort, I notice that I have been chewing less and less frequently since I started. At first, it was every 90 minutes or so. That slowly decreased to 2 hours. Now I find that I usually don’t start getting strong cravings until after 3 hours. Obviously would seem silly to reach for a piece of the gum at the 2 hour mark when I am not even having a strong craving (if any craving at all).

in struggletown right now, feeling like having a cigarette

I started Champix roughly two weeks ago or something like that... Maybe more, but my quit date was 10th November. I successfully did that, but had to go off Champix because I was having visual and auditory hallucinations, and exhibiting a whole new level of crazy (and I tend to be a liiiiittle on the crazy side).

Anyway, I no longer have anything to rely on to help me through (and I can't start patches or anything like that because that's giving me nicotine again, I worry that'd be detrimental rather than beneficial) and I'm only 12 days quit. I'm really struggling today. How do you guys get through those few minutes of cravings after giving up cigarettes?

**tl;dr - cravings are through the roof right now, what do?!?!?**

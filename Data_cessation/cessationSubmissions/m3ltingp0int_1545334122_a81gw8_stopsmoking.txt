Seven Years Later

Looking back on all those failed attempts there is one thing I’m glad I never did: I never stopped trying to quit. Much like learning a new skill there are going to be failures along the way. But instead of getting discouraged at those failure, I figured out what went wrong, why it went wrong, and learned from those mistakes. 


Not everyone will have the same experiences. Finding out what will and won’t work for you takes time. But as you go through the process just remember to never stop trying. 


I personally used the patch to quit. Nicoderm CQ I believe it was. I’ve used off-brand ones in the past and they just didn’t seem to work as well. The biggest change was having to adjust my social life. I basically didn’t have one for a couple of months. Hanging out with friends meant going to the bar, having a drink which lead to smoking. But after those first couple of months I was free, and it was a wonderful feeling. 


So, don’t stop trying to quit. Ever.

What is r/stopsmoking 's general stance on using a juul or similar device to help keep off cigarettes?

I've smoked for ten years, at least a pack a day for the last three-fourths. I've tried cold turkey numerous times before and generally end up breaking down within three days max. Hoping for some input in terms of a vape being at least a slightly better alternative to a pack a day, smelling like smoke and feeling like shit all the time.

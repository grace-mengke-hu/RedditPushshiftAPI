About to quit smoking, and I'm nervous.

So, I've been a regular smoker for the past 5 years, and am up to about 10 cigarettes a day (sometimes more). I mostly smoke out of boredom and habit at this point, but I think I am ready to quit. 


I'm about to move to a new state in 10 days, and think this is a great opportunity to use the change of scenery and environment to help. I was wondering if anyone has any advice on what methods were most successful for them. The state I currently live in provides free patches/gum/lozenges, and I was wondering if those were helpful or if they just made the ultimate withdrawal worse for people. 


Any help is super appreciated! Thank you!  I really want to kick this costly, gross habit.

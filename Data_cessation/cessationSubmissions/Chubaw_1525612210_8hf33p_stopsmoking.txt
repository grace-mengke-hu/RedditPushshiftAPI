152

Missed it, but my cake day was May 4th, and that was 150 days for me.

 I'm so proud of myself it's stupid. Definitely have a craving or two every now and then but god damn do I feel good about saying no to myself for once. 

Life is a dream without tobacco: no chains to hold me back from my fitness goals. My relationship is so much better. I feel so good about this change in my life. I smoked for 12 years, and this is the longest I've quit in 6 years. 

Here's to a lifetime of healthy shit and positivity. Thanks for being a great community!

Cheers!

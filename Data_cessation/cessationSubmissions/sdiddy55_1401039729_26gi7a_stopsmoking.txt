Just a reminder...

I'm 639 without one puff. I forgot that I ever smoked.. You are more powerful than you give credit for. If you say you can't quit amoking you may ne right, but then you only need to change you way of thinking. That's what I did, I thought i never could change or quit smoking.. Than I just grow as a person, amd changed.. They only tjing that makes smoking difficult is that changing of pattern. Find something to rplace the gap  Create the you and the reality you really wants. Not controlling yourself, doesmt benefit yourself.. it benefits the ones who pray on the weak.. Stop poisoning yourself and stop making these evil fucks money. I've never felt better.. I hope this at least helps one person in here. Dont damage the vessel, you cant buy a used bo dy as you can cars.. moral of this post was.. that you are more powerful than you think or than they tell you, you are..

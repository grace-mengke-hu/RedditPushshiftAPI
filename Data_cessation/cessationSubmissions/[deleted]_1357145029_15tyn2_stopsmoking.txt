Work was always the big trigger

But I have replaced smoking with playing ping-pong and foosball with a buddy who is also quitting with me. To anyone who has big triggers, just try to find anything to divert the attention. If you want to get away from your desk and smoking was the only way to do so, still get up and take a walk or go to the lobby or something in your building. Just don't smoke. Good luck to all of you! Day 2 and counting!

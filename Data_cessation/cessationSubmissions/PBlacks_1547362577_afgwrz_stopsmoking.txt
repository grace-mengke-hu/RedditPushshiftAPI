Nearly to 96 hours without smoking!

Nearly to 96 hours without smoking! Been using patches this time because I've tried quitting cold turkey before and made myself sick from lupus flare-up (I guess it stressed my system). Hoping doing it more gently will avoid that.

I think my body's adjusted to the different level/delivery of nicotine by now and I feel fine. Barely any cravings at all. Been stepping outside and chewing cinnamon (non-nicotine) gum for a burning sensation whenever I want a "smoke break."

100 days and ponderings about how long it takes to stop thinking about smoking.

Triple digits without cigarettes! Yeahhhhh :)

Overall it's not been too difficult. (I'm using patches so obviously still not off nicotine completely). Next step is to get off the patches which will happen in the next couple of months. By the new year I'll be cigarette free, nicotine free and almost 6 months off the fags (which will break my record). 

I wonder when I'll just stop thinking of smoking? I don't think about it in a fond way but it's still there regularly. It's like coming to reddit and reading about smoking and talking about smoking is the new obsession to replace smoking. I'd like to go a day without even thinking about it.

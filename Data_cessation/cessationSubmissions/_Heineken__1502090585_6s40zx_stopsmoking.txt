I quit and got about 4 months before caving. So I decided to come here for support and motivation

So, to start. I'm 20 y/o and I haven't been smoking for long. I'd say I started last summer and really only smoked for 10 out of the last 12 months since then. I'm not a heavy smoker. There was a point in time where I was going through some shit last summer and smoked a pack every 2 or 3 weeks. Yes, I realize that's not bad compared to other cases. Anyways, I'm here because I just want to quit. Cigarettes are giving me sebborheic dermatitis. (Tough, itchy dandruff) It's just on my scalp and I just would like that to stop. I've done my research and smoking does indirectly have some connections towards that. (Lowers immune system by smoking and causes my scalp to get dry and inflamed and causes the dandruff). 


How do I know this? I'm not a doctor and I'm getting this looked at next week. However, during my quitting period. The dermatitis was almost completely gone. No tough dandruff patches, no itchy spots. Nothing, it was great! My cravings got worse and my self control got worse and with that... my dandruff got worse. It's just embarrassing and I know what's causing it. I'm just here to post and stay subscribed just to look here every now and again to remember what I'm doing. I got 2 months in cold turkey and really plan to extend that past 2 months again! 


Sorry if this was a tough read I typed this all on mobile. I smoked a couple at work with some regulars who came in and I just felt guilty because I was like a week in to not smoking and it happened... again. I know I have the strength in me to stop and I was doing great for the time being. I just work in the restaurant business and that's where it all began.

Edit: I just realized I typed 4 instead of 2 months. Edited my math in the earlier paragraph. I only got 2 months in, not 4 sorry for the mistake

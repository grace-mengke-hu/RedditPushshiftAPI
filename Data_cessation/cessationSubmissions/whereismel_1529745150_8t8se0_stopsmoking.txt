I am struggling, Day 4

Not smoking feels like i am dying.

People say its not that hard, to just “relax”

To not think about it, keep busy, keep your mind busy.

Nothing helps, nothing works.

The suffering feels eternal. My head throbs, my head aches, my head is dizzy and sleepy and confused and unfocused and thats just my head. 

Im angry. Why should i suffer when im trying to do what is right and good for me, why does it have to be so hard. Why is it harder this time, why was it easier last time. Has it really been ten years on and off that i have been a smoker? How many hours have i lost of my life. Is it even possible to regain them?

I can breathe clearly but at what cost? To feel repulsed by food? To be angry and unable to calm down when conflict arises?

To feel lost and sad and scared and that maybe this world is nothing after all and my life is only meant to be of hurt and pain and i am in essence torturing myself?

My hands keep shaking, my body aches, i am so tense my back and shoulders are in constant spasm. I am not handling this. I am not feeling okay i am feeling so sore and my head just will NOT stop pounding. 

I read online that my body during withdrawals literally thinks it is dying. I feel my sanity is as well. Will i feel better? When? Will i go mad from the sickness before than?

I am fighting with my partner, i am unable to focus on a simple tv show. My fingers are moving independently from twitching and no one gets it. No one understands.

Calm down, relax, think about things; as if thats not all i hope for. To feel relaxed for just one second. The patches, the gum, nothing, no relief, just a rash on my arm and a bad taste in my mouth. 

Tell me it gets better.

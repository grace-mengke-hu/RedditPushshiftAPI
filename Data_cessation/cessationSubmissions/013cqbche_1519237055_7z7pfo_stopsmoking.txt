One year smoke free!

It’s honestly the best thing I’ve ever done and my proudest achievement. I have not once looked back, but I do remember the despair I’d have reading other people’s success stories and thinking that could never be me. But if you’re a smoker reading this, I want to reassure you that it will be you! When the time is right and you find what works for you, everything will fall into place, and you will be a non-smoker for life!

Even when I last tried to quit I was convinced it wouldn’t last but it did and here I am, happy and healthier than ever and saving so much money each month.

I used prescription meds to help stop which sounds extreme but honestly it worked incredibly well. It was like flicking a switch that made me not want to smoke anymore. People get worried about the side effects of medication, or feel that their addiction isn’t bad enough to need medication, but honestly, I experienced no side effects at all, and the side effects of continuing to smoke are far worse and far more likely to happen than any prescription effects! You have nothing to loose and what works for one person doesn’t work for everyone so don’t be demoralised if you try to quit and fail. I’m pretty sure there are very few smokers who quit on their first attempt. There is always another time and a different method to try, and try again!

Been depressed to hell recently. Don't even care anymore. Tempted to smoke.

I don't want to though, I know it's just a bad spell, the last time I started I regretted it but at the same time it was comforting knowing I could just quit anytime and knew how to quit (for my own habits anyway).

I'm just tired of this pattern. I hit a really bad low, feel suicidal, don't care about myself or anything and just don't care generally.

I haven't smoked. I don't want to. But those niggling temptations come back.

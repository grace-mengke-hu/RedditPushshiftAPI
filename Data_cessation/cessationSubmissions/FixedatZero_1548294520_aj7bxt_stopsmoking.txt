After 5 days I caved :(

This is why I caved:

* I wasn't prepared for how hard it'd be. I've never tried to quit before and BOY was I way out of my depth.

* I didn't have anything to substitute quitting with. I should have had some gum, some lollies, *something* to keep me busy through the cravings.

* I was bored. I should have had something to do. I took a week off work to quit and didn't have much to do to keep me distracted. Netflix binging wasn't enough. I need a hobby, or at least I should only take a few days off (the first 3 were the hardest).

* I should have written a list of *why* I  should quit (and what I had to gain from quitting, rather than losing), and read it over and over.

* I should have told people I was quitting and built a better support network. I was doing it completely alone, I should have had the help of my family at the very least.

These are not excuses, but rather they are reasons as to why I caved and I hope that they will help me next time I try (which *will* be after I finish this pack).

I'm not proud of myself for this. I feel so ashamed. I thought I was stronger than this, but holy fuck I am not. 

The worst part about quitting was that without the nicotine, I didn't feel like myself. It felt like I was floating between who I am. Without it, I felt distant, like a shell of who I was. But I am not my addiction, and my addiction isn't who I am. 

Does anyone have any advice for my second try? Thanks for reading :)

Relapse

Day 13 off cigarettes. 
I went for drinks last night and everyone was smoking I caved and bought a pack of which I smoked 8 and then tonight I smoked two more. 
Frustrating thing is if I reset the app to 0 days I don’t think il stay off them , I’ve added that I smoke but not reset my quit date. 
I manage a busy bar / restaurant where it seems everyone smokes, so I’m always around it. 

I just can’t see a time where I’ll be able to say no and not have the odd one. 

I suppose I’m just looking for advice on what I can do.

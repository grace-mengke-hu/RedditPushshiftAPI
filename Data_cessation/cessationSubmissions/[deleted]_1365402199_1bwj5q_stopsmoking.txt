I like smoking..

I've quit off and on, i notice i can smell better first time was this past winter after day 2 i smelt winter for the first time in Febuary...it reminded me of my childhood. Anyway i quit for about a day but was hanging out with a friend today that smoked and throughout the day i probably smoked 3 or 4 cigarettes, so i said fuck it and bought a pack. Rationalized it by saying I'll make it last a week and that a cigarette at the end of the day aint so bad...had the pack for about 2 hours and already smoked 3. I'd like to think that i can limit myself...but its so hard to not just be like fuck it, "I'm bored" do you guys maybe have any techniques...for the fuck it attitude? Plus i look really cool smoking and sometimes a song will come on while im driving and I'm like damn this song needs a cigarette. A philosophy that i say to myself everyday is "you're born and you die everything else is just icing" and that does not help with my smoking situation. I guess I'm in the need of a new philosophy...if anyone has one that has worked for them I'd love to hear it.

TL;DR What is your quitting smoking philosophy?

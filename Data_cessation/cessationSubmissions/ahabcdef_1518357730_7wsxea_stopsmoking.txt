Rewarded myself

Today I bought some perfume  (bc I can smell again jeeej) to reward myself and it felt soooo good. When I walked out of the store I saw a man smoking a cigarette and I thought to myself: THATS the money I just bought this perfume from and it made me feel really really proud. If you just quit, keep going !! The reward feels so much better than the cig!! Hang in there

Well here it goes again.

Well after reviewing my account this will be the third time I have tried this, and hopefully when they say "third time is the charm" it sticks this time. ~~If my badge is still at 215 days it's wrong I requested a change before I posted, I will edit once it changes.~~

My wife and I have our second child due at the beginning of October and I am just tired of smelling like an ashtray and want to be happy and healthy for them when they get older. 

If there are any other people who are just starting out today, if they want a support system or anything feel free to message me.

EDIT: text change
2nd EDIT: Formatting error

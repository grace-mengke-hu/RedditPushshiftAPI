Smoke free for two weeks, side effects and benefits

Hey everyone, love this community, you are all very supportive. I enjoy reading everyone's post. I hope you are all doing well!

So as my title says, I have now been smoke free for two weeks. Actually, it is 13, so that's nice. I don't use a badge (I can't bother, please forgive me!) but I use the smoke free app together with my girlfriend, whom also quit smoking. All seem well in cigfree-town, although... 

Except for the usual benefits; no more smelling like smoke, better breathing, less stress, etc., etc., I have begun experiencing some side-effects as well and I'd really like to know if anyone else has these same problems? 

I am in my young twenties and my libido is low. As in, I don't even want to watch porn or just jack off. I feel off! The first week was fine, but now I feel as if I am in some sort of flatline. What to do? I have begun working out and getting plenty to sleep, but my libido is still whacked. Also, is this normal? There's not much litterature on the subject on the internet (as far as I'm concerned).

One year Nicotine free as of right now

Couldn't have done it without you all. Those early days were tough but absolutely doable with your support and love. It's totally possible and one of the best things I've done for myself. Just do it! Thank you again for all your help and happy new year, happy new you!

Ps. I spent the money saved on walking a five hundred mile Camino to Santiago de Compostela and now run half Marathons  (I neither walked nor ran anywhere before quitting smoking/Nicotine).

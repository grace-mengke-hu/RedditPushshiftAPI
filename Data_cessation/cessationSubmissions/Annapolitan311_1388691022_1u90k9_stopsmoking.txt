I FEEL LIKE I AM TAKING CRAZY PILLS

I decided to just quit cold turkey on NYE this year. Cliche? Maybe.  I kept searching for a reason, waiting for the right time, or to feel "ready to quit", whatever that means.  I think I came to the realization that I am never going to be ready.  So, fuck it.  Here goes nothing. 

It's been just over 36 hours without a cigarette and I feel like a lunatic!  I can't focus.  I can't relax.  I can't sit still.  I feel like I am going to hulk the fuck out on everything and everyone that I encounter.  I nearly broke the entire house on my way out the door this morning.

Someone, please tell me this gets better...

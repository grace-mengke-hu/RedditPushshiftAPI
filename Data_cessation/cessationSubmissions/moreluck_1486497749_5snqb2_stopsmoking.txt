5 days in

It's been hard. Lots of physical symptoms. Nausea, acidity on day 3 . Found out alcohol is a trigger on day two. Day four, unnecessary sweating and I thought I had a fever. Felt bloated and gassy. Cravings have become less frequent on day 5. Having an if - then plan helps. I just made mine. I'm going to kick this habit in the nuts, bash its head in, light a fire and dance on its naked corpse. Hooya!

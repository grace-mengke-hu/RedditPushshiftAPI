Unlucky Number 13

That old thing about 13 being an unlucky number is BS. I woke up to breakfast this morning and it tasted like a whole third dimension of flavor had been added that never existed before. Not to mention I could smell it and breath it in like I never could before. Friends, if you need motivation to stay quit, if you like food as much as I do, then this should be motivation enough to quit!

Firsts

I'm noticing how the quit journey is pinmarked not by each day that passes, but for every first time I'm doing so and so task as a non smoker. Today, I am moving. My first time packing boxes up cleaning house for a move as a non smoker! Tomorrow, this will be further proof I'm a non smoker. A week ago I went camping, my first time camping as a non smoker. I thought of smoking almost none and had minimal temptations, proof I'm now a non smoker! The first time at a bar.... the first time someone offers me a cigarette.... the first time taking a work break with a smoker...... the first time getting drunk.... I think that getting out and doing things is heaps beneficial to the quitting journey. It presents more frequent little challenges that remind me that I have done this I can do this.

It has been one week cold turkey :p

I smoked 3/4 of a pack every day for the past year, and I was a smoker for about 4 years. I am 23 now and I am quitting because I want to preserve my health and I want to make sure that I am self disciplined enough to destroy this addiction with raw willpower.

I stopped cold turkey last week and so far it has been very easy. There is definitely a powerful sense of withdrawal that is physical and mental. The mental part is the easiest, the physical is the most difficult.

Overall I feel that this process is relatively easy as I expected to be writhing around on the floor. I believe that most people are just very weak minded and cannot tell themselves no. There have been things much more difficult in my life that I have had to overcome. It will be cool to be able to tell my friends that I simply walked away from a pack a day. lol.


It would be best if I had a graph every day that could tell me exactly what percentage of smokers make it to X day, X hour, X minutes, into a cold turkey quit. That would be really cool.


Also just for the lol's, I have been drinking coffee non stop for the past week. I drink probably 4 or 5 cups a day. It is the most brutal thing I have ever done to my mind in combination with this quitting business. It feels like my mind is being stretched out and overheated 24/7. Completely brutal shit, and I am developing serious OCD lolol

but fuck it if I can do this I can do anything I set my mind to, and I want to finish my degree really bad, and it's really hard

Day 4: so far so good

My 4th day without cigarettes, been chewing nicotine gum pretty regularly but at least it's better than smoking. Have been hanging around friends who still smoke which is definitely hard, but I've just been popping gum and chewing toothpicks every time they go out, I'm hoping I can keep this going because I already can feel the health benefits.

Edit: just noticed my counter only says 3 days but I'm pretty sure this is the 4th day, must not switch to 4 until the day is over

Just noticed something SUPER COOL!!! 2 months!

I just popped on to check my mail and saw that my badge had a number 2 in it.  Holy Crap I am 2 months smoke and nicotine free!   

That first month I thought I was doomed to fail, but you all helped carry me through.  It was like walking through molasses - very emotional molasses.

This last month?  I can't believe that 2 months have already passed and that that NEED for a cigarette is just a lingering thing that pops up when I encounter a situation that causes stress or that I have not yet enocuntered while not smoking.  And then it goes away like a ghost that was never there.

This recovery is an amazing thing and I am gleaning so many gifts because of it.

OH and:

Money saved:  $203.07
Tar not taken in:  6.062g
Cigs not smoked:  606

Thanks to you all and to those still in the fight of the early days - keep strong, come here often and carry on!

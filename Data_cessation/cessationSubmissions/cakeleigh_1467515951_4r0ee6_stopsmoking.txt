Cold Turkey and sticking too it this time!!!

Tomorrow will be a week, and I am really proud of myself. I've smoked for 9 years and I've felt like I've tried a billion times before, but this time I'm serious. 

Using the MyQuitBuddy app has been helpful. Also have been texting with another friend who recently quit, almost like a Quit Smoking Sponsor. 

It hasn't even been that long and I am already noticing so much:
- I don't miss the cough
- Tastes!!!
- Smells!!!

I think day 3 has been the hardest so far. Just wanted to say hey to a group that can relate.

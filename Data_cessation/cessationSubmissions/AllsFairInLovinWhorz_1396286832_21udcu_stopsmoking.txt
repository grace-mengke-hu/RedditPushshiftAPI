Quit almost two days ago and I'm scared for anyone who crosses my path today... help...

So i quit almost two days ago, but I have been a hot mess since then. I'm flip flopping between wanting to crawl in bed cry my eyes out and never move again, and burning anyone who talks to me alive with one look. I've already almost taken my boyfriends head off for smoking in front of me and for having a meeting that he has to go to tonight. I don't really feel physically ill, but my emotional health has gone out the window.  I just want to smoke and chill out!

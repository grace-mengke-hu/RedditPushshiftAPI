Today is day 1

So although I've only smoked for about 4-5 months around 12 cigarettes a day, I can already tell I'm mentally addicted to it. I used to smoke week daily until a couple years ago I started dating the woman I love now. She wanted me to quit, so I took kratom for 3 weeks and barely noticed any withdrawals. I still use kratom here and there, but it gives me huge craving for a cigarrette. 

I've been smoking behind my girlfriends back but I got caught last weekend so I need to cut it out. I tried quitting a couple times before, but only made it to day 2 or 3 before caving in.

So I guess I'm just curious if there's anything I should do for cravings? Should I get gum or patch? I have a vape pen somewhere at home but it needs new coils... any advice is appreciated!

brain fog and lethargy

i quit a few days ago but i use my vape. i prefer to not count the days because I want to make sure to not let the overconfidence of the days i've gone without smoking effect me. 

when does this get better? 

I plan on stopping vaping in maybe two-three weeks.  should i stay on the vape longer (making big life changes, don't want to over-stress myself).

also want to mention that I love this community and am motivated each day by your stories :)

I made it through a punk rock show

EVERYONE WAS SMOKING! And usually I’d be right there with them, but I made it! Today is day 3 and I’m worried because everyone says this is the hardest day, but also because this is my first day back at work since I quit. And I work retail at an electronics store. Pray for ya boy!

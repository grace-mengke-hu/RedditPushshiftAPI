Relapsed after just two days

I’ve really underestimated how stressful work and school are. I keep telling myself “nicotine is the only good thing in my life” and shit like that and the thoughts are so hard to shake. 

I know exercise is meant to help but I’m in an aerobics class and it just fucks with my terrible lungs more. Is there anything else I can try to replace cigarettes/vaping? It’s fucking with me so much at this point.

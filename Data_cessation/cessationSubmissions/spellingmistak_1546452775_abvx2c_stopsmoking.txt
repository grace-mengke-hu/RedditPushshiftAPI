Aching throat

Does anyone else have an aching, throbbing feeling in the front of your throat under your chin when you are experiencing nicotine cravings? It feels like a burning lump caught in my gullet and my mouth keeps on overproducing saliva.

Anyway it feels unbearable although Iâ€™m really really determined to follow through on this. Does anyone have any tips for how to weather the first few days? Does it get better haha

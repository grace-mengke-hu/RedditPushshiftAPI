A few tips and some motivation

So I'm only on week 4 but I'd venture to say I'm finished. I don't miss it, and wont be starting again any time soon.

I just wanted to tell you all, if you go cold turkey and just swallow that first hell week, the rest is easy. I was out drinking with a bunch of smoker friends last night and I can seriously say I didn't even feel a twinge of jealousy. I was actually relieved that I didn't have to spoil the moment by sucking on dry ash. 

I have noticed having much more energy as well and my erections are twice as hard (yup, Marlboro man isn't so manly). Oh and as a pack a day smoker that leaves me 40 - 50 bucks a week to do with as I please!

So here's a few tips:

**[Alan Carr's book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUEPjcjI2-c) helped me a ton.** Don't turn your nose up at self help books, this one really helps you understand the psychology of addiction, and I couldn't have done it without it. 

**Ditch the substitutes** (nicotine gum, patches, etc). They just stretch out the withdrawal period which is when you're most vulnerable.

**Get a gym membership.** The amount of expendable energy you'll have when you quit will be overwhelming sometimes. It's nice to have an outlet.

**Find a good time to do it.** Don't try now, wait for that long weekend or the end of finals. A good environment can make it much easier. Don't procrastinate though, set a date and stick to it!

**Don't try to quit gradually** I have never had success with this. It also stretches out the withdrawal, and it becomes too easy to allow yourself that one cigarette (which inevitably turns into one more). 

**Focus on your last few cigarettes.** We think we like them because of conditioning. But focus on the taste. Does it really enhance your beer or your coffee? Does it really help relieve the boredom of waiting for your bus? If you become mindful of these moments instead of instinctual, you might realize that you don't like them after all. Desire is a liar!

Good luck everyone!

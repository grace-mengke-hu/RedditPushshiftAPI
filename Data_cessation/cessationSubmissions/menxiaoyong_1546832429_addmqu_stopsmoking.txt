One day at a time

I always see this sentence in this subdit. I also saw it on [whyquit.com](https://whyquit.com)

It seems that this very important for quitters to stay clean. English is my second language, 

**So what does this actually mean by saying "one day at a time"?,** how could this help me with my quitting?

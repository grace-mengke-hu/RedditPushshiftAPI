Rounding out day 2, lurker just wanting to say hello.

I've been flirting with quitting for ages, but I'm really going for it this time. I work in a stressful, extreme environment with a huge smoker population (arctic oil field), and it's been years since I went a single day without a smoke. I only began smoking heavily about five years ago, so my hope is that I haven't done too much damage in that time. 

I am quitting with the use of the patch, occasional nicotine lozenges for the worst cravings, and the quitnow! app to track my progress. I intend to wean myself off of the chemical crutches over the next several weeks. I'd prefer to go cold turkey but I could never manage it in the past. 

Up here the commissary where I can buy smokes is only open three times a day, for an hour each time, so I'm finding that my biggest cravings happen during those times. The biggest immediate benefit I'm finding is the flavor of everything. Even something as mundane as ketchup is suddenly sharp and tangy. Maybe I'll use less hot sauce in the future.

I just wanted to say hello and offer some encouragement (read: make myself accountable) to you all as one more layer of determination. If any of you quit on 12/28 I'd be happy to partner up for check-ins or encouragement.

Good luck to you all. Let's do this.

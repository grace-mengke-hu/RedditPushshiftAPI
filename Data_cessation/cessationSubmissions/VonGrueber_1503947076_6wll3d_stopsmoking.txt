Thanks for your posts, support and inspiration!

Today is 1 month since I have quit smoking. I have been smoking for 17 years, and 1 month ago I have decided to take back control of my life and quit smoking forever. There is still a long way to go. And I have to admit that warm summer nights on the terrace with a glass of wine do hit the spot and make me think: "Now would be a perfect moment to light up a cigarette ". I do feel super proud of myself for making that far, and I am so grateful to all of you guys for sharing your stories and encouraging comments. Reading your posts helped me so much throughout this month, and made me feel that I am not alone in this fight. Big thanks and have a great start of the week!

Day 5 of weaning: serious nausea and stomach cramps. Is this supposed to happen? When's it going to get better?

I was at a pack a day for three years, had a midnight epiphany and decided to quit. I'm really, *really* not a cold turkey person, so \- with the assistance of my wonderful girlfriend \- I'm going for one a day for the next month, and then quit. Not looking for cold turkey advice, but I'd be open any recommendations about that schedule (or suggestions for a better one).

To the point \- since yesterday I've been nauseous, throwing up, and have had really bad gas plus lower stomach cramps. Is this something I should expect from weaning, or is it just something I ate? And if it's normal, when should I hope to get better? Any advice, especially for relief in the meantime, would be much appreciated.

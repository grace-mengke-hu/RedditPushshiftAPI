Advice on best tricks to quit...

Have been trying to quit smoking - cold turkey. Nothing works and I can't stop. Any advice on what tricks worked best to get you to quit or that you've heard have worked would be greatly appreciated! 


Edit: I realize this isn't easy as I'm going through it. I guess trick wasn't the best term to use - just looking for wahat helped everyone else. Thanks for the help! 

Edit #2: 6 days smoke free!!!

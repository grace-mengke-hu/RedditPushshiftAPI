Quitting Is Hard - But the Rewards Are Vast

Just a periodic hello and some encouragement for fellow quitters. After 45 years I quit cold turkey.  My only regret about quitting is not having done so sooner.  Aside from the obvious health costs of smoking is the more difficult aspect of the habit which is the psychological conditioning that starts making all waking consciousness and activities affixed to a extremely powerful reward system. 

So two things: the sooner one quits the sooner one's body can start to be healthier, and equally important--the shorter time invested in psychological associations.

Hang in there!

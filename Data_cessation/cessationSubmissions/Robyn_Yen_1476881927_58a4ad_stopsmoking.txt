1 month doesn't count

I quit smoking for a whole month, over that in fact. The only way I can describe it is I feel that I never quit. I had the odd craving but it passed and I'd carry on.
 Then I had three in a row, then the next day (today) another three. Ive found myself so upset that I'm back at square one and I have no motivation. This is why I've decided it doesn't count. Those cigarettes are now imaginary, they never happened and I'm going to keep being proud of how far I've come!

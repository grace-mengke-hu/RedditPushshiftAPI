Last morning coffee + cigarette, hopefully for good.

Hey all! I was on here the last time I tried to quit and found it extremely helpful. Been smoking about a half pack a day (this varied) for ~8 years, and it's time again to try and kick it. Thankfully this time I have the added motivation of not being able to afford cigarettes.

In any case, just wanted to say hi, and that all of you trying to quit are a bunch of freakin rockstars! Best of luck to everyone no matter how far along you are in your journey. We can do it!

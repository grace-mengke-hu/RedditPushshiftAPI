I smoked for 8 years, now 5 days in to quitting - need some motivation

I have been a smoker since I was 15, I am now 23 and this is my first proper attempt quitting. I have read a lot of reddit posts on the subject and keep getting doubts about ‘not wanting to quit’ or ‘not being ready’. 

This is something I really want to do but the cravings feel like they are intensifying and I can’t see them getting any better with future triggers e.g. Drinking and being around smoker friends. 

Please give me some solace in your own quitting stories / techniques you found helpful /a break down of things to look forward to e.g when do the cravings ease off? 

Thanks

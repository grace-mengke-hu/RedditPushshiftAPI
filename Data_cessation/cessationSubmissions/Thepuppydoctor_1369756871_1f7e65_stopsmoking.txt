80 hours in

I woke up this morning and realized I've been clean for 80 hours. The withdrawals have started to subside, my lungs seem to have grown by a third, and I have more energy and concentration.  The issue is I live with 10 other guys in a college bungalow situation and some of them smoke. so far I have isolated myself in my room and slept through the worst of the withdrawals, but If I am around them when they smoke will that bring back the nausea/headaches?

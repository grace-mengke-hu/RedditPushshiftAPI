It's time

24 year old male.  Have been smoking since 18.  I am sick and tired of this habit and I notice it is starting to take a toll on me, especially in the weekends when I binge.  It is a waste of money, it makes me smell horrible, and it controls my life.  Quit cold turkey last Sunday (3/17/13), and I'm in my third day with no smoking.  Going to sleep last night was complicated, and I am having a hard time not thinking of it.  I want to quit now, at an early age, and get this over with.  Anyone in my approx age and time smoking have any advice? Is cold turkey the best way? Or have you tried chantix or gum/patches?  My fear will be this weekend and seeing how I will react when I have alcohol.  ANY tips are encouraged.  Thanks!!

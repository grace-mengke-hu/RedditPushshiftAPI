Which allen carr book do you think is best?

Two pack a day smoker here, who's got a slew of health issues despite being 21. Shit needs to change, and since I've got a bunch of google credit I really want to try out Allen Carr. 

But, there's so so many books to choose from. There's a short easy way, a longer easy way, one meant for women (which I am), the "stop smoking with", stop permanently.. I could go on but that would be an incredibly long list. 

So, which one to chose? I'm especially interested to hear if there's merit in the womens or illustrated version (or maybe even the illustrated for women cause of course that's an option as well).

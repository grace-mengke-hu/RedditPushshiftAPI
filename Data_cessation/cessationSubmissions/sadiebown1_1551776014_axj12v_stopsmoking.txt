Any1 need a buddy?

Alright, so I just have never posted anything like this, I typically keep to myself and believe I can everything ALL BY MYSELF XD. But I have come to terms with my human nature, and have decided to reach out.
 I have never considered myself a "smoker" (I know, silly right?), as I have always been a &gt;6 a day smoker. I always loved it! I loved the ritual, the taste, and the feelings of "relaxation". I thought I was in control. I never believed I'd be to the point I am now: I hate it and I cant seem to quit. I'm almost 21 now, but I was one of those dumb teenagers who thought it made them look cool at 16. So here I am 5 years as a smoker, and as much as I like to deny it, I am no longer in control, and I am beginning to realize I NEVER was. 
I have tried multiple times in the last many months to quit, but always seem to find an excuse to put it off to a later date.  Well here I am, 1 year out from my original quit date, and I hate to admit that it is beginning to seriously make me not look too fondly upon myself. 

So AnYwAy.....

I am beyond ready to take the leap for the last time, and REALLY quit. Are there any peeps out there who seem to be stuck in the same unending cycle, and would like to trade encouragement??  Looking for a dedicated partner in healing, who also has good taste in memes. XD 
XOXO

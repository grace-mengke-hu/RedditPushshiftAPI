Ex-smoker stopping by to offer encouragement

I smoked over 2 packs a day for 20+ years and finally quit 8 years ago. I remember how hard (and scary) the early stages of quitting were and just want to tell you that it really, truly, absolutely gets better. I rarely think about cigarettes, and when I do it's more nostalgic than anything else â€“ like remembering childhood vacations. It's just part of your past. So hang in there!

Is it stupid to quit in the afternoon?

I've been smoking for like 35 years, and quitting for 33 years. At this point it's a stupid game since I can't erase the damage of 35 years of smoking. 

I enjoy weight training, and I enjoy singing. If I feel I want to grab the guitar and jam a bit, I must set down the smokes for a day or at least several hours before hand. Needless to say I don't sing as much as I'd like to. I also notice I'd rather sleep than do anything else, unless it's a day I've either not smoked or smoked very little. 

I find it harder to make the attempt at quitting than ever before. I used to smoke a Marlboro light variant at a pack or so a day. Some time ago I switched to American Spirits. While I don't smoke as many, I think each American Spirit cigarette is equivalent to 3-5 Marlboro cigarettes. 

I'm just tired of smoking ruining everything. Literally everything. I started this about 1:45 and I want to stop now, but I know that doesn't work well since I haven't the night of sleep head start.

I did 9 days cold turkey and then slipped up. Arrrrgh!!!

I am so angry with myself. I feel like I've let everyone down.

It was going so well. I did 9 days. But, one thing I struggled with was depression, anger and irrational thoughts. I spent the weekend arguing with my girlfriend over stupid stuff, and most of today was spent arguing. I found it incredibly difficult to hold my emotions together during the difficult time.

It was fathers day yesterday and I really missed my Dad. He died in January this year following a long Cancer battle. I have other issues going on in life too with major depression being one of them.

Today, I had enough of it all. I wanted it to return to normal, to stop the arguments I was causing. I looked at the tobacco for a good 15 minutes and then caved in.

I have a doctors appointment at 5:15 for depression related issues. During all the arguments I tried to commit suicide. I stopped myself, but I was close. I got as far as tying the rope, and getting the stool. It got real bad and I have other issues going on right now that made stopping very hard.

The moment I had a cigarette all my problems went away.

Now I feel ashamed, and disgusted, in myself. I fear I may have also damaged my relationship.

I am going to speak to my doctor about nicotine replacement. I could do with some patches.

Sorry to all :( I really want to quit, and I really am trying. This isn't the end, it's a blip on the radar.

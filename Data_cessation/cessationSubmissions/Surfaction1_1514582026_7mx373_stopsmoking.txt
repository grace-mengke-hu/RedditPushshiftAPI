Trying to quit the juul

I know this isn't traditional analog cigarettes but I got myself addicted to the juul and basically just any nicotine over the summer. At first it was hella fun and felt soo good. Unfortunately as it always goes it soon became necessary and although withdrawal is no where near agonizing it's just the cravings that get to me. Like I don't want to do shit until I get a fix and I always regret doing it at night when I'm sleeping like "fuck man I should have just not hit it". It's this insanely frustrating cycle and whenever I crave it all rational goes out the window and I just have that fuck it mentality where I don't care. Was there anything you guys found to be especially helpful to just keep yourself from using nicotine? I have only been hooked for about 4 months but I feel like if I don't stop soon I'm never gonna quit and it really scares me cause I'm only 18 and I don't wanna be stuck doing this shit forever ya know?

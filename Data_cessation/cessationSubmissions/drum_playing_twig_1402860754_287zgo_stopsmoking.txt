Two weeks smoke free, still feel like shit, does it get better?

Recently I received two unexpected bills which forced me to quit smoking if I were going to afford food until end of the month when I get my paycheck.

So it's been over two weeks since my last smoke and even though the first 3-4 day was worst, it's still not good. 

I still miss smoking. The physical craving isn't strong, but it's constant. Like an annoying little splinter that reminds me of how glorious it used to be to pop a cold drink, sit on my balcony, enjoy the view in this summer heat, and puff away.

I see a lot of you say stuff like "FUCK SMOKING" etc and I wish I could share the hate for the habit but I can't. I guess because I was forced to stop, I didn't *choose* to stop. 

And I freaking loved smoking. Quite shamelessly too. Of course I don't want to be a smoker for the rest of my life, and I have been smoke free for 14days+ but I just want to know: When the hell does it get "normal", where I don't even crave it on a mental level?

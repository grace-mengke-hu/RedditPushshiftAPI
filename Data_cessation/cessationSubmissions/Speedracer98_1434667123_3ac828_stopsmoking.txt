I quit, using Allen Carr's Easyway!

I smoked for about 5 years and a friend of mine shared with me the webcast seminar he had watched to help him quit. After watching this it made so much more sense to me not to smoke! I can not recommend this program enough to anyone out there that is finding it difficult to quit. Give this a try, it will put things into the right perspective and help you stay adamant about your choice to quit. Anyone else ever tried this?

I have tried every method of quitting smoking except actually wanting to quit smoking.

UGH DAY 2

I don't even think about cigarettes until I see them. I walk by someone and it's so easy to throw a "hey can I bum a..."

All of my friends smoke. I am constantly waking up with a headache, a gross feeling. I spend most of the nights not getting anything done because smoking just takes so much energy out of me and puts so much "you can get it tomorrow" in me.

I've smoked for 10 years.

I went to a funeral on Monday and smoked til my lungs were full. I decided to quit Tuesday.

I woke up 8am Tuesday morning and the first thing I wanted was a cigarette.

It felt like I wanted relief from a smoking addiction and the only way to do that was to fill my lungs back up with smoke.

Which is so strange.

I know non-smoking is a better life overall. But the romanticism of smoking, the camaraderie, the social, the "step out for a smoke," the "beer and a cigarette," it all keeps me with a pack in my pocket.

I mean except today but as soon as I leave work and pass a convenience store I'm like "ah yes, a cigarette after a long day of work, you know what, you deserve it champ."

Anyway life is garbage.

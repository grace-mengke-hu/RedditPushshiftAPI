Just had my last smoke

Yep, I'm gonna do it. I just smoked my last cigarette... I don't worry about success or failure right now. I will go to bed soon, and I will wake up a non-smoker. I know that I will be triggered a lot when I get up and I'm prepared for it. Just need a lil bit of support :) Thx...

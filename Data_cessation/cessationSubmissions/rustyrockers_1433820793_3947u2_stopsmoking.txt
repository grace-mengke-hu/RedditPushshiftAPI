Not smoking cuts likelihood of anxiety and depression in half.

This article gives me hope, and wanted to share with you all, if you haven't seen it before. It states how smokers are 70% more likely to suffer from depression/anxiety, than non smokers.

There's another similar study out there that says smokers are twice as likely to be experiencing depression as non-smokers.

TLDR: on average, an average non smokers enjoys life with effectively twice the enjoyment of someone who is addicted to smoking. To me, this makes a lot of my life a little clearer.

I don't want to quit smoking but I do.

I know how bad smoking is bad for me and I wish I can have the motivation and the strength to quit smoking. 

It is not like dieting where I can stop doing what is bad for me just for a couple of months and cheat sometimes and eventually find a good balance that is sustainable. I have to really decide to alter a part of my life for good. I am having trouble with that. Deciding to do something about it. 

The biggest reason I do want to quit is my husband. I love him and he is very upset about the fact I am smoking. Logically,  I understand him and I do want to stop eventually but right now, I don't know why I just can't quit. 

The thing is, he has strong will power and he just stopped smoking couple years ago and doesn't understand me. 

"Just stop" is not something I can do. I know I am being weak and stupid but I guess I am just who I am. I need a better way to quit other than JUST QUIT. 

Is there some kind of program that I can join? Like getting into shape, is there a step by step program or a way to smoothly transition into quiting? Or am I just a helpless weak person who is babying myself? Is JUST QUITING the only way? 

Pretty sure my husband is fed up with me quitting and sneaking in a smoke hear and there again. Which is practically lying and I know I did him wrong. So don't think I can ask for any help from him. Please tell me what I can do on my own.

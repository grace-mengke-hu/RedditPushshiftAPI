My Whole House Stinks

I feel like I have to bleach & febreeze everything & leave the windows open for a week. I smell cigarettes & dogs & the fish tank & the trash cans. It's very upsetting that my house has smelled like this for who knows how long & I'm just now realizing it. Time to do something about it, that's for sure.

Starting day 3 today! Up before 7am for the first time in years.

Hey guys.

For years I've struggled with sleeping at night and waking up in the morning, to the point that I've missed exams, had issues at jobs, etc. I quit cold turkey on Tuesday morning and yesterday I had no trouble getting up for work on time. Today was even easier. I woke up at 6:55am, before my first alarm even went off and actually felt like I had the energy to get up and go. This is insane! I've not even been smoke free for that long but my mornings feel so much better already. I feel like I can conquer the world!

I'm not going to stop here, this is one of the best things I've ever done. Fuck nicotine and dirty cigs, they've done nothing but ruin my life over the past 4 years, it's time to reverse that! I know a lot of people say day 3 is the hardest but I'm not going to let myself get fooled by my brain today. Not another puff, no matter what.

Love to all on this sub going through the struggle, it's so worth it, keep on fighting guys!

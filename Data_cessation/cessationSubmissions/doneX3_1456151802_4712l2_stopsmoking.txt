Question for creative project types

I was previously in a stressful job and had developed many bad coping habits, ie smoking, drinking, junk food. I changed jobs mainly to reduce stress and get my health back. Making progress on all counts.

As part of my "healing" process I have put all creative projects on hold, and focused exclusively on health and fitness. Thing is, as I get better, I start to think about new creative projects I might undertake down the road. The projects would be very consuming. As as I start to think about them, I get a massive urge to smoke. 

Frankly I'm afraid to go down the path of such a project, for fear of smoking. 

Your thoughts?

Day one again

I started using the nicotine patches last night around 6. A couple hours after that I tried to smoke a cigarette, because it's very habitual for me. I knew it was probably a bad idea but did it anyways. Luckily it didn't make me sick BUT it made the cigarette totally not enjoyable at all. I took a couple drags and put it out. It was working very well for me. I sat with two friends while they smoked a couple and wasn't even bothered with cravings or the urge to smoke. Here's the negative though. I have restless leg syndrome and I take medication for it every night. I have no issues with it while I'm on the medication. When I tried to go to sleep last night I had the worst RLS I've had in a long time. I took the patch off, washed the skin area, and laid back down. No issues after that. I woke up this morning with moderate cravings but was able to resist fairly easily. The directions on the box say that if you have issues with side effects at night you can take it off at night and reapply in the morning as opposed to wearing one for 24 hours. So I think that's what I'll do. Just wanted to share my experience with the patch. Hope everyone is doing well and enjoying being smoke free!!

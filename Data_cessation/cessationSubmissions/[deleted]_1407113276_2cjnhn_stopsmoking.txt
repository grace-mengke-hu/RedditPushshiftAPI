Dream smoking

Currently on day 4, 12 hours in. Last night I had the smoking dream started. I remember this happening the last time I quit but it was a lot worse back then. I'd wake up in a cold sweat and be pining for a ciggie first thing in the morning but today I'm feeling good, and the dream hasn't fired up my craving so much. 

I'm really surprised at how much this subreddit is helping me ward off any self doubt and I'd like to thank you all for the help.

LONG TERM QUITTERS: Weight gain &amp; appetite after quitting

Hi all, 

Congratulations to everyone here for making the decision (or even thinking about) quitting smoking. I've quit drinking and had major mental health issues and this, by far, has been THE HARDEST thing I've ever done. 

Nevertheless, I've been smoke free for 132 days now and have gained about 8 pounds. My appetite is also out of control. I run daily (I run ALOT) and am eating more than I used to, but not by too much. But this appetite makes me feel like I could eat for hours without actually feeling full. 

My question is for those of you have have been nicotine-free for awhile - in your experience, how long does the increased appetite/weight gain last? I'm hoping the answer is 3-6 months :) if it's more than a year I might cry myself into a pint of Ben &amp; Jerry's or eat an entire pizza. Either way, gaining weight is not good for my already existing depression. 

Thank you!

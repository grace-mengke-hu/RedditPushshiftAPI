I need some advice. Social smoking caught up to me.

I was a pretty heavy smoker for 6 years ages 18-23. I was able to quit for about 4 years (at least while sober) though I've always had a problem if I get any alcohol in me I have to smoke. I'm don't drink often so that only ever happened about once a month or so. A few months ago I started a new job where a lot of my co workers smoked and I started smoking socially with them a few times a week. 

It has finally caught up to me and I fucked up and bought a pack yesterday. Smoked 2 today then got pissed and threw the pack away. Fucked up again tonight bought another pack smoked 2. I CANNOT let myself become a smoker again. Any advice on ways to quit this shit for good? The nicotine withdraws right now are minimal but I've never been good at going cold turkey.

I'm thinking maybe I'll allow myself 1 cigarette a day for a few days then cut that to a half cigarette or maybe get an e cig. I've never really enjoyed smoking vapor so I think that might be a good thing. I'm kind of in a stressful situation right now with my girlfriend so this makes things more difficult.

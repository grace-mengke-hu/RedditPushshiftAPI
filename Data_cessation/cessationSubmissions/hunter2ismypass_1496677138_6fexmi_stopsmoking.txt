Has anyone had success quitting by first smoking tobacco with no additives?

I just bought some American Spirits cigarettes. It says they're additive free. I DID NOT buy them because I think they're a safe alternative. I DID buy them because it says they have no additives and I'm thinking part of the issue why I'm addicted to cigarettes is because I'm partly addicted to the additives.

The plan is to smoke these for a month and then try switching to vaping. I've read some websites that say that nicotine itself isn't addictive. Supposedly it's the additives that are addictive. Don't know if this is true or not. Perhaps the truth is somewhere in between in the sense that perhaps nicotine isn't as addictive as it is with normal cigarettes because it's the additives that make it so damn addictive. Just a theory.

It's funny how your mind fucks with you

My father recently quit smoking after being a pretty heavy smoker for over 50 years. He had a minor stroke and had to have an open heart surgery, which is what prompted his quit. Interestingly enough, besides that, his health is excellent.

I've asked him how he felt about it and he claims he simply doesn't really care about cigarettes anymore. He's tried it once or twice since, and found that it simply means nothing to him anymore. I find it fascinating how easy it was to break the habit, and also how (relatively) little it has affected his health over the years. Not kidding, it's making me rationalize going back to smoking. Not a lot, just a couple of cigs a day. A part of me feels like it's only a matter of time until I crack, and another will keep struggling for as long as possible to not let that happen.

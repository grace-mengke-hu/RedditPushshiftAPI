I'm struggling, perhaps you fine people could offer some guidance.

Background: I've smoked a pack a day for the last eleven years. I made the decision to quit back in February, and spent months mentally preparing myself and making a substantial plan for quitting. On my quit date, June 30th, I was able to go a whole 24 hours before I broke down. I wasn't discouraged, and a week later I was able to make it four days without smoking (which I never thought was even possible for me!). I overestimated my ability to be around smokers in a social setting, though, and had a cigarette again on day five. 
I've been smoking about 3 a day for the past week.

I'm feeling pretty discouraged at this point, because I just can't seem to put them down. I replaced my usual morning routine of smoking with exercise and a healthy breakfast, but it seems like night time is the worst. I don't have insurance, so a medical intervention isn't really an option. I guess mostly I'm struggling with an empty feeling I get at night, when I think about not smoking. Has anyone else experienced this?

Another post someone made on here recently was pretty helpful. They said to say to yourself "I quit" instead of "I'm quitting". I just want to get back to the place I was in, when I was able to say "I quit" for those four days.

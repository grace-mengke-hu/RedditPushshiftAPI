Starting today

Hi fellow redditors, I discovered this sub from the front page. 

I have tried stopping for as long as I can remember myself smoking (15+ years). 5 years ago I stopped smoking for 6 months and was in my best shape ever. Each day I promise myself it would be the last. I just finished a packet and will not buy an other one. 

I am going to try an experiment, each time I want to smoke I will try to edit this post and describe my feeling and my attempts to get over the temptation. 

I have no excuse to keep doing it.

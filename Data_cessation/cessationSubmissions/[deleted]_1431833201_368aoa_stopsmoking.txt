day 1 - quick question

smoked my last cigarette last night and haven't picked one up today. I was waiting for the patches to arrive but decided this morning to get a head start. now I have the patches and I'm wondering if I should use them or keep going cold turkey because I've already started the process of ridding my body of nicotine. 

I've read Allen Carr 2x and watched the video. he makes perfect sense but it didn't work immediately. I'm nervous - have been a long time lurker but this really feels like I'm doing it! you all rock. any suggestions and support much appreciated!

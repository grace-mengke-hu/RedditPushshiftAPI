Day 3 - Feeling so much easier!

Stopped all nicotine on the morning of the 7th.  First day believe it or not didn't seem that bad.  Sunday though, OMG, thought I was going to crack.

I've been smoking/vaping for about 15 years.  Over the last 18 months or so, nearly all vaping.  This is the first time in a long time without nicotine.

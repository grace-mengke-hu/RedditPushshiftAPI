First Test (Beer)

Still pretty new to not smoking- not going too bad. Only an occasional crave- the first 2 days were kind of tough, I just didn't know what to do with myself. But it's Friday, which means happy hour with the co-workers. I've had a beer or two since I quit, but it was with non-smokers. We go to a bar that allows smoking (one co-worker still smokes) and this will be my biggest temptation so far. I use to love smoking while drinking, but always felt like crap after. Any advice?


I thought about getting an e-cig to help, but I haven't used anything the entire 4 days and I'm scared it will actually make my cravings worse. I do have an empty e-cig that I could use. I'm just worried my addiction is telling me, "yeah- an e-cig!! It's not cheating and you get to feel like you're smoking again!"


Maybe I should bring my dumdums? I keep a bag in my car because that is where I crave smoking more- when I'm driving.

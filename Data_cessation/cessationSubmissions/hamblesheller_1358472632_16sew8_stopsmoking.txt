Therefore I go, Dubious but Elate--Day One

I am on the Chantix and today is my first day not smoking in 46 years. I have never seriously considered it before. Never. I have read the easy way to stop smoking, joined you all, and doing my best to hold on. Any advice, suggestions, encouragement are more than welcome. I am so grateful that you are all here. Wish me luck!

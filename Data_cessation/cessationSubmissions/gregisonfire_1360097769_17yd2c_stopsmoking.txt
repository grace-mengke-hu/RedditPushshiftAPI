Two weeks down - my thoughts, observations, and tips

I've made it two weeks as of today. I never thought I would make it this far before, but now I'm wondering why I didn't do it before. I thought I'd share my thoughts, observations, and tips with you all in case it could be of any help.

1. **Quit cold turkey.** I've tried quitting before, and my last attempt was with the e-cig. It doesn't work. We're not just quitting smoking, but we are quitting nicotine. While it may seem like a good idea, there's a reason that we didn't switch to dip or some other nicotine delivery service years ago. It'll lead you back to smoking. If you quit cold turkey you'll get what was causing your addiction out of your system. You don't have to read Allen Carr's book to realize that this is the problem.

2. **Find something to do with your time.** I've been using Cessation Nation to track my progress in regards to my quitting. After the first day I quit, I learned I spent about 30-35 minutes smoking each day. Replacing this time with another activity, any activity, is crucial. I started reading for 30 minutes more a day, realizing I had time to do an activity that was oft neglected. Some days I would work out more, others I would get in another round of Dota2, but anything is better. For the random cravings I would chew a piece of gum until it went a way (I've gone from a Marlboro Man to a Trident Man in just two weeks). Finally for the situational cravings I found something else to do. When every would go out at the bar, I took that time to talk to a friend who doesn't smoke or go to the bathroom. Instead of having one after... *activities* with my SO, we just did it again. Literally anything will do. Find what fits as long as it's not smoking.

3. **Track your progress**. Like I mentioned before, Cessation Nation is a wonderful app. It's nice to see how my health is improving in a visual manner. You don't need to do this with just apps, either. My SO will comment on how long it has been; it's easier for me to breathe and go up stairs; I have more money in my bank account. Just keep track of everything that has become BETTER since you've stopped. It's a great motivator. 

I hope this helps. I'm excited to keep going!

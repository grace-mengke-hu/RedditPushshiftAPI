Conflicted about quitting

Hey stopsmoking.  I'm three days in after 6 years of smoking a half pack a day.  I'm away from home on a month long job and my ex-smoker coworker convinced me to try quitting.  

It's pretty brutal so far not gonna lie.  Today has been the worst.  My problem is, I don't think I really want to quit.  I've never tried, and to be honest, wasn't planning on trying any time soon.   Going home is going to be tough.  ALL of my friends smoke. I mean, all of them.  This girl I started seeing is a smoker, too.  I don't feel any adverse effects of it either.  I lead a fairly active and healthy lifestyle, and smoking has never really felt like a burden to me.  As in, I'm not one of those people who is a slave to their addiction and says how they need to quit every time they light one up. 

Really, the only reason I can see to quit is to not get cancer in 30 years.  Which is a damn good reason, I know. 

So I guess I need some help.  I need more inspiration than just fear to quit.  Thanks.

Day 3!

I’ve been a heavy smoker for over 20 years, I’m on day 3. Yesterday was tough and I have a feeling it’s going to be just as hard. But this is the longest I’ve ever done (apart from the first 18 years of my life). The reason I’m stopping is that I’ve been diagnosed with COPD and have 69% lung capacity. So I have a good reason.... just wished I’d done this a few years ago.
Trying to keep strong!

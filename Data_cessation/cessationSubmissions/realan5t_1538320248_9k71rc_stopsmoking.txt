Smoke free since June 1,2017-dumb thought to start again

I’m going on a 15 day Hawaiian cruise in December, and the first thing I thought was “well I should start smoking again.”  It’s ridiculous bc smoking on a cruise ship is sooooo inconvenient.  My hubby quit six months before me and we had been on two cruises as smokers.  We have two small kids so we’d have to arrange and plan on smoke breaks so one of us could be with the kids while the other went across the entire ship for a smoke.  Why on earth would a cruise be a trigger for me???

Read a few threads about Nausea but need more help..

I have been off cigarettes now for 1 week, I am on the patches so wasn't expecting to feel nausea as I am still getting nicotine into my body. Last night and this morning I keep having spells of nausea and was just nearly sick. I read a few threads but a lot of the comments where just saying to hang in there. Does anyone have any remedies I could try? I'm coming up to exam period and I am quite desperate as its distracting my studying.

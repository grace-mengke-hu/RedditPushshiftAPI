Today is exactly 6 months of being quit

Today I feel like one bad ass dude guys.  Woke up, put in my headphones and biked for 20mi this morning (Thereâ€™s no way in hell I would have been able to do this this time last year). Since quitting my pack a day habit after 10 years, I think Iâ€™ve finally made it over the biggest hurdles and my anxiety is  subsiding. So far my self improvement quest is shaping up pretty well. Dropped almost 30 pounds &amp; girls are starting to smile at me more ðŸ˜‰. Anyways by the time I turn 28 in November that one year feeling hopefully is going to feel even better than the six month mark. 

PS donâ€™t miss those American Spirit Blues one bit

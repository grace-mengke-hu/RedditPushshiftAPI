It starts today.

I've been a frequent smoker for the last 3 years and in the last year I've probably smoked twice as much as I did in the first 2 combined. Now I'm facing lots of different health issues that all relate to my smoking habits and I've had enough of it. I can't waste my life away like this. But I can't quit alone. I'll need your help and motivation to do so. Please support me through this. I need to get through it.

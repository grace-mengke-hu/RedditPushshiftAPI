I know how hard the withdrawal symptoms always hit me. But screw it here we go!

Over the past 2 years I went up to 40-50 sigarettes a day.  
  
I feel like there's a constant energy drain on my body that I can only partly refill everytime by having a smoke. For the first time I just really wanna quit so after 8 years, I will.  
  
It might be a bit of a silly thing to post but screw it, I wanna be able to look back at this in a year and be happy about it!

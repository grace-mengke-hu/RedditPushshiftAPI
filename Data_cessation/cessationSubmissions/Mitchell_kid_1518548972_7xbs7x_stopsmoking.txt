Its been about 5 months since I quit

I had my last cigarette about 5 months ago (used Chantix) and ever since a stopped the Chantix around a month or so after I stopped smoking, I am extremely tired all the time. Even with 7-8 hours of sleep, I still get so tired that I can't stop myself from falling asleep. (Not while driving, luckily) I know that Nicotine releases adrenaline in the brain and I assume that this is why I am so tired now, but instead of picking up the habit again is there something I can do or take or eat that is a good substitute and will give me that boost I need?

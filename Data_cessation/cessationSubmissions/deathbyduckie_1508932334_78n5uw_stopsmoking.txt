Day 70

Just checking in. It's been just over 2 months since I last had a cigarette. I've been vaping instead but getting to the point where I vape because I like it, not because I need it. It was 2.30pm before I vaped the other day and I hadn't even noticed. Feel so much better not smoking and I only think about smoking about once a week now, if that. Anyone who is just starting their journey, know that it gets a million times better.

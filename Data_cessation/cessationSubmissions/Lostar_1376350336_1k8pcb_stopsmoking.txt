Cost/Benifit Analysis

After being on this subreddit all day, looking for support helpful tips etc. It seems like a large majority of people here are 'straight-edge' nicotine nazis that think the DARE program is cool and that Scruff McGruff is a hard ass on crime. I'm of the mind set that drugs are what sets a part the cowards from the people who are free to live their lives as they see fit. Smoking, to me, is a rebellion from soccer moms and business men who want to live forever. I have accepted that I'm going to die. You will to, it will be painful, it will be terrifying. Why not just fucking smoke a cigarette and not worry about it, and just accept that life is a carnival of pain. 

If it weren't for promises I made 6 days ago, I'd be smoking right fucking now to spite all you fuckers. I fucking hate all of you.

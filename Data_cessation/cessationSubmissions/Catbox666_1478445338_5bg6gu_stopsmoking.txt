[21m] Lots of willpower... and anger. DAY 1 OVER!!

Tried kicking the habit multiple times beforehand, often times it was my angry irratable outbursts that got me back on the smokes again. This time I promised myself - no matter how angry, frustrated, or anything I get I will not stop my goal.

Yesterday, there was a lot of anger in my head. I was participating in a computer competition for school, and screaming when the answer I submitted was the right one, but it wasn't formatted to what they would accept. I threw shit around... I was super angry. I was mad at my life, mad at my parents, mad at my cat, mad at a lot of stuff. It's as though this nicotine addiction is challenging me.

Well, I won the first day's battle of willpower. Suck it, nicotine.

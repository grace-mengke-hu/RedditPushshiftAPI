11th day, went cold turkey

I had just been a social smoker, being an introvert it helped me interact with people with whom I smoked with. Now I feel quite confident and realised the side effects of smoking so I just quit. I'm just 21 years old and used to smoke 2  daily for the past 9 months at once a week it used to be 6-10 smokes a day, its so tough for me to find a reason not to smoke. At times I really feel like letting go and have a smoke or two, but I haven't until now. If you guys can just help me out by giving some strong reasons TO NOT SMOKE. I just feel like to have smokes occasionally but I don't think thats a good idea.

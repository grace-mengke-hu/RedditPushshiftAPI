The beginning of my journey

Hi there. 

I'm just to the point where I feel really motivated to quit. I've been smoking for about 2 years and it started socially, then became a way for me to manage my stress. My husband smokes too, and I don't think he's quite there with me, which I know will make it hard. Tons of our friends do too, and I'm worried about losing the social aspect of it. 

That being said, I was offered a new job today, and I dont want to walk into a new office as a smoker. So here's my question... do you ween yourself off, or just quit all at once? I smoked for a while in college and was able to quit cold turkey because my (now) husband said he wouldn't date a smoker. That one was easy because I loved him and it was an easy choice. Now, 5 years later he's smoking too and isn't ready to quit with me.

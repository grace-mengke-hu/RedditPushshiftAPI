Apologies for losing my temper.

To be clear: I am not taking back anything I said about the negativity I see on this sub. 

But I do realize that I was indulging in negativity myself in my post, and that I was ranting and raving rather than calmly communicating - which is the very thing I was condemning in others. 

I apologize for that. While I might not agree with the approach and the tone of some people here, I could have kept all that anger and resentment to myself, or expelled it elsewhere. 

I'm human, and my feelings got the better of me. I will do my best not to let it happen again.

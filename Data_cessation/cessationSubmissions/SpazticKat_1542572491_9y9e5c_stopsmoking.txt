3 years 6 months + free

Just wanted to pass by and offer some encouragement. I have been free since May 2015, after many failed attempts before - one lasted 5 years. I am under no illusion that the journey is over, it only takes one puff - I know from experience. 

It does get easier. I no longer think of cigarettes - it helps that I donâ€™t socialise with smokers  and I avoid bars. 

Never take another puff

Peace and good luck.

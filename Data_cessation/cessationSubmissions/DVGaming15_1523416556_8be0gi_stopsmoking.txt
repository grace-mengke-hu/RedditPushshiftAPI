It's time this chain stops

Sorry if this turns into a bit of a rant. I'm upset and have a lot on my mind. Hopefully you guys like this little post. Hey! 17 year old non-smoker here wanting to share a little story... So my mother and all of my aunts have always been heavy smokers. FYI their mother (my grandmother that I never really knew) died of lung cancer in 2010. My sister and I were actually able to get my mother to stop for a while around a decade ago. She started again after all of our lives got thrown for a loop. (Allegations that father had been sexually abusing my sister) She hasn't stopped again since, and refuses any help. It's even gotten to the point where I can't go outside without getting blasted by smoke from her and the aunt we live with! Well my other aunt that lives down on the Alabama Gulf Coast has just been diagnosed with throat cancer. Don't know what stage it's in or if they caught it soon enough. So I was thinking about it and this came to mind: HOW did she not see this coming? It's my full belief that the cancer-on-a-stick had a lot to do with this. Everyone on this side of the family is slowly killing themselves and I'm powerless to stop it. I'm heartbroken at this realization, but I also have a newfound determination to break the chain. It just isn't worth it. I'm not going to ruin my life or anyone else in my family's life. If my relatives refuse to make the change, I'll do it myself by not smoking in the first place. I'll be the start of a new, poison-free family of my own. Thanks for reading if you got this far. It felt good to get this out of my system. P.S. I'm not one for religion but please keep my family in your thoughts. Hell, even prayers are appreciated.

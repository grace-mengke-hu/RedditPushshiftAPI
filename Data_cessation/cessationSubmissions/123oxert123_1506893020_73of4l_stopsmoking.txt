Heavy cravings at day 49

Hi everyone, I'm at day 49 now and so far so good. Haven't touched a cig since the day I quit, although I use a vaporizer with 0mg nicotine (more as a pacifier). But there is something I noticed.

While the amount of cravings is declining, I notice a increase in severity of the cravings. While I have only 1 or 2 cravings a day, these cravings are realy damn hard. It is really hard to resist a cig. 

Does anyone else feel or felt the same? I would love to hear some experiences.

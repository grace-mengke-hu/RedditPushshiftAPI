At 26 I had been smoking for 54% of my life. 6 weeks cold turkey and I've never felt better.

I had wanted to quit for a while for health reasons and my girlfriend despises it. I was on vacation in Sweden for my cousin's wedding, finished the pack I had brought with me and went to the buy another one when I decided to just quit. I was in a beautiful place with fresh clean air and no stress from work or responsibilities. I was 12 when I started, by 15 I was a 2 pack/day smoker, at 18 I cut back to 1 pack/day. I thought about all of that and looked around me and said "That's it, I'm done." Now, I feel great, everything tastes better and smells better. I sleep better and feel better when I wake up in the morning. I still get a craving here and there, but I know I really don't want it. I had tried to quit before in the past with multiple methods, but never made it passed a month (usually about a week). It's never felt so easy and I've never felt so sure. I think the real key is to be disgusted with your habit and yourself, in order to truly hate smoking and never want to do it again.

Does it get better?

So it's been almost 5 months since I've had a cigarette and I still want to smoke. Like I think about it at least once a day and this past week has been really hard as far as cravings go. I have actually planned out in my head how easy it would be to go to the store and buy a pack and just smoke one cigarette. I don't want to go back to the way I was . I keep telling myself I could totally handle just smoking one a day. The really bad part is that I want to smoke but I also want to hide it from everyone. 
I guess I just want someone, anyone, to tell me that it does get better and that eventually I won't want to smoke anymore. I just figured that I would be completely over it by now. Really disheartening to think I will never stop wanting one.

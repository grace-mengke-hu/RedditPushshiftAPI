1 year on.

Never posted but today marks one year since giving up. Used to read the discussions on here often at the beginning and reassured me. Believe me it was hard at first but will get easier and easier until you really don't think about it that much at all. So just wanted to say it is so worth perceivering! You can all do it too!!

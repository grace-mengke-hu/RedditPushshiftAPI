A couple of thoughts from my experience and a bit of advice: do some physical activity!

400 hours. 16 days and 16 hours free. I want to share some advice from my experience.

I remember when i first come here that i ignored messages from people just a few days in, thinking "they could relapse any moment, i should only take advice from people that actually quit". I was terribly wrong, the motivation i have now and the insights i'm able to give you are simply different from what more experienced people will give you, and both are valuable to you. Don't make my same mistake!

[This was me 19 days ago,](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/6sghim/im_extremely_anxious_at_the_idea_of_quitting_and/) i was in panic. All the situations that i described in that post just went on and now i can enjoy all those situation without smoking. They were not better while smoking, they were exactly the same. 19 days ago i was anxious and in panic, and now i'm happy and i've not regretted that decision once.  My addicted mind regretted it plenty of times, but my logic and rational mind never once. **Some days have been hard, some cravings have been hard, but those things are going to pass whether i smoke or whether i don't smoke, while the benefits of not smoking are permanent and i can have them only not smoking.**

Sometime it feels absurd that i was smoking more than 20 cigarettes a day, where did i find the time to smoke this much? How could i do it without just coughing or asphyxiating? Sometimes it feels silly that i would be anxious for not having a package with me all the times. It feels absurd that i was able to exit my home at 4am just to buy a packet. Why i wold do that? It's so cozy here. This is the way i lived for 13 years and it already feels strange. Because it is strange, it's strange for a rational mind to understand this kind of behavior once some things are broken.

My biggest advice is to **do some physical activity**, especially if you are young. I always wanted to be fit and healthy, it just didn't worked for a smoker. I tried more than once the [Couch to 5k](https://www.reddit.com/r/C25K/) program: an extremely simple, but effective, program to get anyone from a sedentary lifestyle to running a 5k in three months. That just doesn't work for a smoker. A smoker can't track his physical improvements, one day he will be able to run some time, but another day he could run half that time only because he has smoked a little more. For non smokers physical activities is a constant improvement, for a smoker is a struggle to just do anything at all and there isn't an sensation of improvement because **for a smoker the goal is not improving, but not getting worse.**

When i went to run on my *third* day without smoking i could run more than any other time in the past, including time while i was actively training every day. My lungs hurt after a while, they probably weren't used to work that way, but next day i went running nothing similiar happened. Our body is great at recovering.

Yesterday at the park i've seen an extremely fit guy that was happily jogging without a sign of tiredness on his face. Now i know that i can become like him, if i train nothing will stop me from achieving that. **It's entirely up to me**. Before, i knew that as hard as i could train, i would have a physical limit given by smoking and i could never become like that guy. I wasn't free and i wasn't in control of what i could and could not become and that was depressing. What's the point of eating healthy if i can't exercise properly? What's the point of exercising if i can't improve? What's the point of having a healthy lifestyle if i have to smoke and damage myself anyway? The rabbit hole can become really deep, really quickly. 

Other than this psychological things, there is another thing that helps me. When i'm out running, **i feel my lungs working, they are doing what they are supposed to do and they are doing it great**. They are still recovering, but they are recovering quickly. Every day i go out, i can run a little more than the day before. Feel less tired than the day before and have a more pleasant experience than the day before. Putting even a puff of smoke in my recovering lungs would backtrack this a lot, would physical harm this process and this recovery i'm having and it would feel horrible. It's something that it's just not supposed to go there and when you feel your lungs working they way it's intended, you can really understand it. The most curious thing is that even if my mind still finds that the cigarette smoke smells good, when i run and i happen to pass near smokers it's the most horrible thing i can smell, i literally feel i have to throw up for a while. I think my body is sending me some messages.

Other than this, that means a lot for me for my long desire to just be healthy and fit, you will be amazed to discover a lot of little things every day that are just...better. 

I can easily wake up every day as soon as the alarm rings. Without any problem even if i slept too little. When i smoked getting up was so hard that i consulted my doctor more than once on this, thinking it could be some serious problem that really was making my life harder. I could snooze my alarm until late afternoon in the week end and more than once i was late at work because i just slept in. Now it just doesn't happen. 

Smokers stink, this is going to hit you really soon. They just stink horribly, that's it. I just sincerely hope that it's something only ex smokers can feel due to some sort of smoke sensitivity, because i would be ashamed if i've smelled like that to non smoker in a lot of situations.

I discovered that my hair are not greasy as i though. If i didn't washed my hair for more than three days i would look like a hobo, now i could probably don't wash them for a week and i couldn't tell.

I discovered life is more enjoyable with more disposable money each day. It's not the money per se, it's the ability to indulge in a lot of things you wouldn't normally do. Everything under the price i used to pay for a package instantly becomes something i will buy without regret and without thinking about it. I literally burned that amount of money daily, i can certainly afford that trivial thing i don't really need, but that it's nice to have.

I hope i can help somebody with my experience, it's easy to quit smoking, you just have to be patient for a couple of bad days and then you can gain huge improvements in a lot of different things. It's probably the best trade you will ever do in your life, do it!

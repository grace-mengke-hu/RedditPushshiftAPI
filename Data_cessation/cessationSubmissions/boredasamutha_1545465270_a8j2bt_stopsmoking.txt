Best vape to stop smoking??

My preferred brand is Marlboro lights. I tried Smok brand and Blu (I think) and it lasted about a week until I was regularly smoking again. I'm getting discouraged, but I know that vaping is the way to go for me to quit. I'm wondering if an actual vape that requires me to push a button and blow out a cloud will work better. It's weird but I didn't get the satisfaction of a cloud of smoke from the ones I've tried. Any suggestions?

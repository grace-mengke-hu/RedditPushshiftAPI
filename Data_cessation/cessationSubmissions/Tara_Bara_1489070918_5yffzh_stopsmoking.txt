What is it about Day 5 anyways?

Today is Day 4 of my quit, but I'm anticipating tomorrow being a beast. I've quit before (many times), and ALWAYS, Day 5 gets to me. Sometimes, it even defeats me. I've read multiple posts on here too where people are having a rough time of it on Day 5. It can't just be coincidence. 

At any rate, at least I'm braced for it, lol!

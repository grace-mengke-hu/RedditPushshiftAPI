Quitting today - 22 August 2019

I quit smoking for 2 years and started up again 2 years later. I had my last cigarette at 10:30am this morning. I’m quitting because I want to start running again, and right now, my lungs feel like they’re going to explode after just a few meters. I know it will be hard but I believe I am capable of doing this. Here’s to being smoke free (starting today) for the rest of my life.

Just quit..

So I switched from smoking to dipping in order to quit.  I would dip once when I got home from work every day until two days ago when I just stopped.  The thing that sucks is that I'm studying for a very big test in June that requires a few hours per day.  I can't concentrate and im extremely irritable.  I have this burning feeling in my lungs and chest like I need a ciggarette.  Cant explain it.  Will this stop soon?

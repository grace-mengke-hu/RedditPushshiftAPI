Help with the little things

I'm going through my second attempt at quitting. My last full pack ended December 2nd, and since then I have had a grand total of 6 smokes, three on February 16th and three today. 

I'm using vaporizers, not sure how this board thinks of those, but I was started on 18mg of nicotine and now I'm down to 6. Those little starter pens were too unreliable, they would die and I'd fix them for a few more days, then die again. That's where February 16th came in. The day after I bought a much more reliable mod, and that has worked very well until this morning, when the battery died. My own fault, I didn't charge it. The feeling of withdrawal, or something missing hit, and I bought another pack. It's charged now, and the pack has been flushed, but I worry that every time something goes wrong, and the vape isn't there, I'll go back and start smoking again, and I won't stop for a while.

Maybe I just needed to get it off my chest, I know there's a board for that, but really I feel I'm looking for some guidance or insight. How did you deal with the little things? How did you forgo the delicious combo of a smoke and a Vanilla Coke? How did you cope when things weren't right? Thanks.

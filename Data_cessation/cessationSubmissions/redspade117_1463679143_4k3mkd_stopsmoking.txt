Thank you. Time to recover

After some amazing suggestions from you folks, I have to entered the process of recovery. After reading Allen Carr's book and relapsing, I turned to you. As it turned out, that was a great decision.

I also cannot recommend reading this enough if you really want to understand the science of addiction and effective ways to quit cold turkey: http://whyquit.com/FFN/chapters/FFN_00B_TOC.pdf 

I wrote a caring letter to myself this morning to read if things get rough in the first 72 hours. It was the nicest thing I've ever written about myself and it made me tear up writing it. For some reason, I knew at that point I was done with smoking. This is the most confident, happy, and excited I've ever been beginning recovery and I owe it all to you guys. 

Thank you from the bottom of my heart and I plan to update at other times along my recovery and more importantly, try to contribute to the life recovering mission of this subreddit.

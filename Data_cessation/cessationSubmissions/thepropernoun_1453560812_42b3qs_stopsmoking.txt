Day 6 and wanting to hear from you r/stopsmoking! When did you really feel like a nonsmoker?

This is my umpteenth quit, but it feels really quite different. Trying not to get cocky, but I'm super pumped. This one feels real! Doing chantix with no side effects so far. This time I'm actually doing it for myself. Anyway, I thought I would contribute instead of just lurk, and maybe you awesome quitters would share your "I think this is it moment"

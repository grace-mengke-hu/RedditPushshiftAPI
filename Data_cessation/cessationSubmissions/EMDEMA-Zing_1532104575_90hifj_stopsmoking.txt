Smoking in your dreams?

Hey guys so i took the leap on July 8th which was the day i turned 22.

I chose this date because my grandfather always told me to pick a date, drop it and never look back.

He recently died in december from cancer and had quit for 33 years. I said because of his death I will honor him and quit smoking.

Leading up to my birthday I made sure to smoke myself sick of cigarettes.

I even did cocaine for the last time as I know it’s a massive trigger.

Anyway, it’s been almost 2 weeks for me and I’ve also cut back on weed so my dreams have been incredibly vivid.

Almost every other dream is of me smoking a cigarette.

I have no desire to smoke, the only time i may get an urge is after having a drink but I don’t let it occupy my thoughts.

Do you guys dream of smoking? It’s apparently very common with leaving addictions.

It’s quite a mindfuck because I always think i relapsed!

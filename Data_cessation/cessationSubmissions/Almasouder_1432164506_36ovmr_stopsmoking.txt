Day 7 just started.

Hello everyone, I've been smoking since I was 11 years old, I'm 18 now and I am so tired of smoking these packets everyday. Knowing that I used to smoke 2 to 3 packs a day which left me really tired and very hard to breathe. The day I decided to quit was because I just don't want myself to turn 40 years old with strokes or cancer or anything from that. This first week had been a pain in the ass but I'm still surviving and I made up my mind not to smoke a single cigg under any circumstance. Wish me luck

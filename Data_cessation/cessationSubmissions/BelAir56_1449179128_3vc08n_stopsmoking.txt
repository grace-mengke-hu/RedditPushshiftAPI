Guide: how to increase your chances of kicking the habit once and for all.

Welcome to BelAir56's guide on how to kick this costly, filthy, smelly, and unhealthy habit known as smoking.

**Understanding Addiction**

Cigarette smoking is a highly addictive habit that can/will wreak havoc on your body, health, fitness, social standing, etc... (obvious, that's why we are here) However we need to understand why addiction starts in the first place. Addiction can be broken down into 4 main sectors (cigarette smoking applicable only)

-1. Nicotine levels in blood began to fall to a low level in the blood stream, the smokers body goes into withdrawal mode.

-2. The brain generates a crave.

-3. Smoker smokes a cigarette, clove, etc... that raises the nicotine blood level, the smoker is left feeling "relaxed" and "loose" for approximately 15-20 minutes

-4. Nicotine levels start falling after a certain time period.

-Repeat back to #1

So basically your brain is wired up Nicotine. Nicotine is an alkaloid stimulant found in the tobacco plant. Nicotine works on the acetylcholine receptor (nicotine receptor) by imitating the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Nicotine also works on the pleasure center of the brain and releases the feel good/reward chemical: dopamine. 

**Methods to Quitting**

OK so now we understand the very basic of the cigarette smoking cycle and the basics of nicotine interacting with certain areas of the brain. Now here comes the hard part: Quitting.

There are many forms of quitting aids: NRT (nicotine replacement therapy) which includes nicotine gum, chantix, nicotine patches, and e-cigs. The final and the best for you: **cold turkey**

Cold turkey IMO is one of the best methods to kicking the habit. Why would you keep using the same drug via NRT that you're trying to get off of? However some people prefer nicotine and choose to vape (which is totally cool, I did it for 2 years myself) So here are a couple of stepping stones if you choose to go the full cold turkey method:

- Identify your times that you smoke such as after a meal, the morning, after work, during lunch, etc...

- Replace cigarettes with another vice such as a gum (orbit white works the best if you're into minty flavors) , candy, or something to chew on. This way your mouth will be busy chewing something rather than sucking on a cigarette.

- Get all forms of tobacco out of your house. That includes smokes, lighters, hookahs, etc... 

- Research the benefits of quitting smoking on smokefree.gov or any other health oriented webpage. 

- **Commit your will-power 150%** I cannot stress this enough. If you truly want to quit for good: do not half-ass it and have cheats. It is better to give up rather than half-assing it through. 

- **DO NOT KICK YOURSELF FOR RELAPSING** Seriously... We all have our moments where that impulse puts us in front of a clerk, buying a pack of reds, and lighting up in the parking lot. Shit happens folks. Just toss the smokes in the trash and keep going. 

- Got smoker friends? You're now very busy for the next 2 weeks. Being around these people WILL tempt you hard and more prone to relapse. Ride through the most horrible part of the cravings before hanging with them again.

- Like to smoke while completely hammered or drinking? You're now taking a break from alcohol for the next couple of weeks as well. It is very important to identify your triggers/situations when quitting smoking.

- Withdrawals for the first 2 weeks suck HARD. Just remember this though: you will feel better, look better, smell better, breathe better, your wallet will look better, and overall it just gets better. Hang in there!

**Conclusion**

I hope this guide has helped those who have chosen to read it. My final tip: I recommend smoking normally all the way up till you sleep. When you're ready for bed: toss the pack/tear up the rest of the cigarettes then go to sleep. That way you will be relaxed when you sleep. So when you wake up: you can get started a lot easier on the cravings. It is not going to be easy but it gives some nice leverage.

Best of luck to all and take care.

much easier as i thought it'd be

my last attempt unfortunately failed big time ([see here](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1kevhm/the_last_15_cigarettes_ill_ever_smoke/)). 

disappointed in me i gave it another try three days ago and haven't had the slightest desire to have a smoke during this time. to my advantage, i'm currently moving so i guess i'm distracted enough to not even think about those little bastards. 

concerning those 'abstinence syndromes' - they don't exist. to be honest, i've been more feisty the last few days, but that only lasts a couple minutes. easy to swallow. apropos swallow - it's amazing how your sense of taste slowly regenerates. 
 
anyway, even after about 72 hours of not smoking im feeling significantly better and my breath isn't bad anymore -  it's amazing, because im eating fisherman's friends like potato chips. i feel a lot more motivated to do things and improved my self-esteem immensely.

i hope some of those who still haven't stopped get a little more self-confidence and motivation from what I've written to finally take these steps. it isn't as hard as it seems.

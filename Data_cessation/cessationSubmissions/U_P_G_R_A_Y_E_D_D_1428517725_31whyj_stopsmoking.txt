Day 3, I can smell but wish I couldn't. WTF?!

Still no issues with cravings or anything and I'm starting to smell things a lot better and... where the hell is all this gas coming from?! I haven't changed my diet! This is terrible! 

Luckily I have my own office and can keep the door shut but if someone comes in here... Jesus, I'll feel really bad for them.

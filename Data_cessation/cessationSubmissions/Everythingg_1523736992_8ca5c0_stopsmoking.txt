Today has been a little rough

So I spent about 4hr behind the wheel today ( a place I use to chain smoke) 
With a person in the passager seat who talks just hear himself talk 
The combo these two things made today(day 4)  the hardest so far 
But I made it threw that and enjoying s beer before a nap

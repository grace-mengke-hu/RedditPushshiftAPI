Is being this ridiculously sad normal?

I'm on day 9 of quitting my small habit cold turkey. (Honestly, probably could not have made it to this point without encouragement from this sub.) I was irrationally filled with rage last week. Right now, I feel so, so sad. I don't know if it's because quitting smoking is forcing me to deal with my personal stressors and problems or just a side effect?
 

Is this normal or should I be concerned about my mental health? I don't want to interact with any humans. I just wanted to hole up in my bedroom, isolate, and never speak to another human again. 
 

I'm going to try to force myself to go for a walk tonight. Hopefully the extra exercise will boost my mood... :'(

I Think I Am Physically and Mentally Addicted

If there are any non-smokers lurking around here, I STRONGLY suggest you to STAY AWAY from tobacco. You are probably weighing the pros and cons and whether you would be able to quit whenever you want to, but the truth is, there is absolutely nothing positive about tobacco smoking. If anyone told me what quitting is like before I got into this, I wouldn't have put my hands on this devil. 

Coming into college, I immersed myself into the clubbing/partying culture and cigarettes were one of the new things I had been introduced to. At first, I thought I would be able to quit as long as I wanted to. After a semester of smoking about a half pack a day, there's chronic uneasiness in my lungs, which, ironically, can only be relieved by smoking another cigarette. I feel like scum on the Earth if I go a day without smoking. Every morning is a disaster and the cough just won't stop. I tried e-cig and chewing tobacco, but nothing satisfies me like a long, nice drag off Marlboro Menthol. I have attempted oh so many times to quit, but it always ends in the same way. I would just be like, 'let me just get one more pack and I'll be done.' 

I need help. 

Edit: Just threw away my American Spirits pack minus 2 cigs. I think I'm ready this time. 

Edit 2: I set my prize as a major vape sesh at the end of this week if I succeed to go without it until then. You can laugh at me, but this would be one of my major motivations besides my lungs not functioning as they need to.

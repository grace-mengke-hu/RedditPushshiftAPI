One year achievement unlocked! :D

Thanks for all your encouraging words. Just reading about your struggles made mine easier to bear. It has not been an easy year. A death in the family, lot of pressure at work and the end of my relationship have made me think about smoking almost daily. But never did I regret my decision. If I start to smoke because I feel bad, it won't make me feel better but worse. This is because that achievement is mine and I am proud of it. I won't let circumstances or people take it from me. Thanks friends!

Day 3: Nervous about a gig later

Hi,

I'm starting Day 3 - been fine so far, just looking for some tips for later.

I have a work invite to a gig and a few drinks. Thinking I should avoid alcohol, or maybe just have 1 glass of wine. But any tips on how not to be tempted, or keep up the will power when in a social / drinking environment? 

All my previous attempts fail in this particular situation. Its a work thing that I agreed to ages ago so I can't cancel at this point.

Any tips would be much appreciated! :)

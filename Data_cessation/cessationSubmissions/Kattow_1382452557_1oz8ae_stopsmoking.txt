I'm feeling tearful and grotty!!

19 days without a cig. I'm crying at the silliest of things. My skin is greasy and spotty and I feel absolutely knackered all the time. ðŸ˜žðŸ‘Ž

On to the good points.... I am now a MACHINE at my exercise class. I was always the one huffing and puffing in the corner but now I'm keeping up and doing better than I ever thought I could.  I am very smug seeing people getting soaked from the rain when they go out for a cig.

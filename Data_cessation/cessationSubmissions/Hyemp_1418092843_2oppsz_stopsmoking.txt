Why the hell can't I stop smoking?

I have read the book, I have tried the gum, the patch, cold turkey. I've even made it a whole year, but I always go back. Since I have quit for a year, I have only bought a few packs here and there, so if theres anything I have accomplished, its that I only smoke like 2-3 smokes a day at most, but I would like to get that down to ZERO. Cold turkey is the way to go, but I just have such a hard time. FUCK!

Unfortunately, I had to reset my badge. Doesn't mean I give up on giving up though..

Well, after a long period of stopping smoking I made the mistake of thinking I could just smoke a 'few' cigarettes while I was on holiday. As you can expect, it didn't end with a few and before I knew it I was hooked again, smoking the usual pack a day (for the last two or three months).

Well.. today is the day I will quit again, and hopefully with my previous quitting experiences I will not fall for the same mistake I did last time.. because damn, not being addicted to tobacco makes life so much easier. It's easy to wake up in the morning, it's easy to eat and drink healthy (can't drink water with a cigarette), it's easy to go to the gym (your not out of breath in 5 minutes), it's easy to look healthy and last but not least it's easy to not smell like a burned racoon. 

Will be lurking around when I get the cravings.. goodnight.

Anyone had any erectile issues while in withdrawal?

I was just wondering if any of you if it's normal to have a temporary erectile dysfunction while under nicotine withdrawal? At first i thought my problems was cause by the fatigue and lack of sleep but after having a night of sufficient rest and a whole body workout a day before, it seems that I am really experiencing erectile dysfunction. Does anyone know how long this normally lasts? Are there any ways we can do to have better erections while still in withdrawal?


PS: I'm at the stage of withdrawal after the heartburn and acid reflux stage. I'm not really sure how many day's i'm in withdrawal because i experienced the withdrawal symptom while smoking a stick or two a day using disposable filters. Since i'm already experiencing the symptom, i might as well withdrew from smoking completely.

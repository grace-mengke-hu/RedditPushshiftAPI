Diffecult time for one of my best friends

It is really a sick time for a friend of mine right now. He drinks sometimes and has been a regular smoker for the past 2 years. He quit about 2 months ago with smoking and did it very well. 
His girlfriend has been missing for 20 days and today he found out that she has been murdered.


He  told me that he would like to just get hammered tonight but he can´t because he has to work tomorrow. I told him that it isn´t going solve anything if hammers himself or starts smoking again. He agreed but I am not sure if he will relapse in private.
I know he goes through a really tough time, but I also want to help him to stay away from that shit and not to relapse again.


Has anybody dealt with someone who quit smoking and then got confronted with a similar situation? I am not sure if I can find the right words to help him to come back out of the saddness-hole.

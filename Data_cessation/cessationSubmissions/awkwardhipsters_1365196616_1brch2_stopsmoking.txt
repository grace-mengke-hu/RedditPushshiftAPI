Just smoked my last cig... let's go.

My bands currently on a rise and I'm finding myself wanting to rise with it. I attempted to stop before, making it to 24 days, at which point I collapsed for what I believed would be 'stress relief'.
I've been under a lot of stress recently and had also lost track of all my fitness etc over the past 2-3 weeks, I had lost several pounds before hand but my lazy streak has put it to a halt, and I want to gain all my lost momentum before I see myself turn into 'that guy', an image common in britain of an overweight do-nothing smoking and smoking and letting each day bleed. 

I hope I will find all the support I need here and look forward to my 30 day post 

Thank you :)

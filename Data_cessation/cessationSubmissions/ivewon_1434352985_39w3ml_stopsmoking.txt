Getting a friend to stop smoking

Hey everyone, this is my first post ever, and I probably wouldn't even have an account if it weren't for this question. The past eight years, I've never really had many friends. Now I do, and as a non-smoker, it's one of the worst feelings in the world to see a friend smoking and thinking of how he's destroying himself. So what can I do to make him want to quit?

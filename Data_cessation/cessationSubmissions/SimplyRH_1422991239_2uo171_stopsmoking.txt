Day 50. 100% clean.

Guys and gals, there was once a time when I was sure that this feat would be impossible.

I thought for sure I was too weak-minded to give up a simple nicotine habit. 

I thought, "One of these days... but today is not that day."

I thought, "I'll quit after this pack." And then buy another at the first time trouble showed, or after work.

I thought, "My wife smokes, why should I quit? She won't quit either. **(She did, go her.)**"

Then one day, I thought, "Enough is enough. I'm done."

I didn't make a big deal about it. I didn't post it on Facebook or Twitter. I didn't even tell anyone for the first week or two. I just stopped. I did warn my wife I'd be edgy and I was for a while. I still can be some times.

One day. Two days. Three days. Here we go! Four days! One week! I'm doing it! Two weeks! Holy shit!

Three... four... five... I started to lose track in my head.

Here I stand, seven weeks and one day removed from my very last puff of nicotine. No e-cigs. No patches. Just pure faith in myself.

Do yourself a favor. If you're having trouble quitting just think of how good it will feel to be free of the chain attached to that cigarette. It is unimaginable and no cigarette will ever taste as sweet as this. I'm back in the gym, I sleep better, I *feel* like an entirely different person. 

Maybe because I am. But it's been with your help, and the love and support my wife has given me, that I've taken control of my life one step at a time.

I thought... no way. Not me.

Yes. Me.

Thank you for reading.

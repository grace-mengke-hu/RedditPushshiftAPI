Quitting is making me antisocial, kind of thinking about going back because of that

I'm almost 2 months cigarette free ( with nicotine patches) and I'm not having much troubles with the not smoking part, to my own surprise. What I'm struggling with is that it is the emotonial turmoil and especially the fact that since I quit, I am becoming more and more antisocial.

whenever I'm going to a bar, a party or any kind of event that does not incolve a very specific activity ( like a movie, a restaurant...) besides drinking / talking, I'm just... Not "there" and all I want to do is going home. All my friends are smoking and even if I an easily control my cravings while drinking / partying, I just feel like something is missing, like I'm not in tune with the others, so I'm not enjoying myself at all and just leave. I started smoking around 17yo and smoked for 15 years, so all my "social adult life" involved smoking and I now have to figure out how to deal with these situations without cigarettes.

This makes me sad because I just miss who I was before I quit, plus seing people is what is helping me with the sadness / emotonial rollercoaster of quitting.

I sometimes think about going back to smoking just for that, even if I really don't want to smoke again? I know it doesn't make sense, just wanted to share my feelings with people who might be experiencing the same!

Finally after 40 years

So after 40 years of smoking and getting emphysema I had to quit.My lungs were hurting so much, breathing was a real pain. I tried many times and failed.Then I was introduced to vaping.Now I'm on day 23 and I feel great! No side effects and my lungs feel sooo much better.Even my hubby can't believe it.I haven't chewed his head off or even got into a miserable mood!I started outat18 mgs of nicotine but am now down to 12 mgs.I don't believe nicotine is the biggest hazard in cigarettes.It may be the most addictive but it's all the rest of the chemicals that kills.With them out of the way I can now concentrate on cutting back on the nicotine.

Day 1, again!

Well I finished a pack in 2 days.  I quit for a day, then break down and compulsively smoke. I'd say I'm done with this filthy habit. 2 nights ago I was in a classroom with a group of people just completely aware of how bad I reeked of smoke and I was  slightly embarrassed about it.  And today I noticed my finger is visibly yellowed - wtf, I have never noticed how bad it stains my fingers! Also embarrassing. And my teeth and gums look gross, and I feel like my ruddy complexion is due in part to chain smoking a pack in 2 days. Just one after another.  My breath is terrible, and I feel physically gross.  So please help me stay committed to my quit this time. I am so ready to be done with this waste of beautiful life ...

Day 3

Day 2 was a bit rough but it's behind me and that's what matters. 

I'm in the middle of day 3. I thought as with my other attempts I'd be binge-eating and angry but I'm not. The physical withdrawal is zapping my energy yet I didn't sleep a wink last night. I feel confused. I miss my old friend but I have no desire to see him again. My sense of smell is coming back. It rained last night and I forgot how beautiful it really is. It was a nice push in the right direction. 

Emotionally, I'm just kind of... blah. Not sad like I expected nor angry. Just that restless-tired. I can't wait until I feel up to exercise again, I know it'll help a lot. In the meantime I'm keeping my hands and mind busy with some projects I have going. I even finished a few sewing projects that my mum commissioned and I had been putting off. Felt great to finish them.

I will get through day 3 and I will not smoke. 

I'm very interested to see how my emotions go in the next few days, especially because I already have depression and panic disorder, albeit for the most part successfully controlled through meds and therapy. I read a comment in this sub that said, "smoking does not cure depression." It's stuck with me and it helps. I think one of the reasons I feel like a zombie right now is because I had that ridiculous cycle of being anxious because I needed a smoke, I'd have one, then I'd be anxious from the stimulant. Lather, rinse, repeat all day everyday. Now I'm just... level. It's confusing because it's new but it'll be a good thing in no time.

Thanks for listening :) Good luck to everyone else and keep going.

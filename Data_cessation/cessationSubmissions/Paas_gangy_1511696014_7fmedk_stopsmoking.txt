Will I get my voice back?

Since august I went back to smoking, a pack a day. Now I have noticed this fall I have a "constant cold". Allow me to clarify in english, I don't have a cold or bronchitis or flu, I cough a lot and spit a lot of mucus and my voice seems less powerful, I can't sing and feel my chest and throat vibrating anymore, it feels like a loss of volume or power.

Will I get my voice back if I quit smoking?

I am planning on quiting on Thursday at midnight.

Edit: I am singing right now, when I hold my neck with my hand, I feel my voice back to normal, after some exercises I feel improvement but with lot of effort, it is like my throat is coated with mucus or too dry, I can't really tell.

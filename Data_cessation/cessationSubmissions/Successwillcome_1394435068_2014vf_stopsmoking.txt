Hardest Test of my life!!!

This is like day Two of NoSmoke and my god, this is the hardest thing I have EVER done!!! Yesterday I was able to kill my withdrawal symptoms by gym-ing it out but today I can't I have to finish my homework for tomorrow. So far so good. I've quit before, I can quit again(for good). Something that has really helped me out in my pursuit to live smoke free is that I gave someone my debit/credit card so I can't have a moment of weakness and buy a dreaded pack, and it helps with frivolous spending. After this last withdrawal moment I can say that I am almost good enough to trust myself with my money once again.

A little about me I'm 21 been smoking since I was 16-ish because I thought it was cool. I quit for like 6 months when I was like 20 then I turned 21 and experienced bars and the "social smoker". Started back up.  I hate being dependent on nicotine. Main reason for quitting is I'm  Tired of feeling like a heroin addict.  I can and will do this and of your reading. You will too.

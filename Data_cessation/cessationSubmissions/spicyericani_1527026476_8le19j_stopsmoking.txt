Bleeding gums?

Hey guys I’ve got a quick query and I hope someone can help me out/have experience with this?! 
I’m 5 weeks into my quit and I’ve noticed that the last 3 days whenever I brush my teeth my gums have started to bleed?? This has never been a problem before for me and I read up a while ago that someone had a similar experience? 
Could this be quit related??
I’d appreciate any feedback ! Thank you

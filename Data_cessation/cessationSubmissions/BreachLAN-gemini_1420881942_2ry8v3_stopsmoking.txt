Day 5 - Going Great but have this cough.

I've read online that this cough is a common problem with quitting. Teamed up with the runny nose it's a pain in the arse.

I've read that drinking loads of water is the way to cure this. So I'm already started on that. 

I'm curious to ask, if anyone else has tried this and how long it took for you to see results?

Thanks everyone. Keep strong.

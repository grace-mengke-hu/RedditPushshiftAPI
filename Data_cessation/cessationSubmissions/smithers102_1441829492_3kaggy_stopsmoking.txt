Anxious at the thought of quitting

The other day I tried to quit but I started to get extremely anxious about the idea of not having a cigarette. Like, almost mild panic attack level. I didn't even reach a length of time that would cause me withdrawals.

No matter how many times I convinced myself I could do it with determination the anxiety of thinking about not smoking and my life without cigs scared me to the point of starting again. Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this? Or similar stories?

Cleaning up the damage?

I was a smoker for ~4 years (1/2 pack a day or so, between the ages of 16 and 20), quit entirely for several years (from about 20 to 26 or so), and then in the past couple of years for some dumb fucking reason have been smoking casually on and off (a couple while out at the bar, 1 or 2 at night sometimes after a couple beers, etc.). I'm sensing it creeping back up on me so I want to nip it in the bud. Anyway, that's just to set the context, my main question is: after quitting smoking, how do you repair the damage done to the lungs? I worry about lung cancer, is there anything one can do to improve their odds, in addition to simply quitting?

Lost for words

I haven’t had a cigarette in over a year. I have no idea what my exact date is because I didn’t really think it was going to be my last smoke. But I’ve been struggling recently.  The weather is great and every time I see someone smoke I’m jealous. Yes, I know it’s nothing to be jealous about and it’s the addiction talking. Extra stressors have been present and obviously isn’t making things easier. I know none of those things would be the reason I was to relapse. It would be because of me. I really have no idea what I am even talking about. I don’t want to smoke but I do. Oh well for now I guess.

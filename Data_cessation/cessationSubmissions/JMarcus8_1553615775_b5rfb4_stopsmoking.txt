Tips for dealing with a death after you quit smoking?

My cat passed away unexpectedly a week ago. It was a traumatic experience, he had a stroke after planned dental surgery. I haven’t smoked because it won’t bring him back. But I’ve been so sad, and I’m having trouble coping with this loss. My mind keeps trying to trick me into thinking smoking will help. Does anyone have any tips for dealing with grief after you quit smoking?

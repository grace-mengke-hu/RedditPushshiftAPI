Question: I'm over the 100 day mark, but still getting chest cramps

I quit over a hundred day mark after smoking for like 8 years (fuck yeah.) but recently I've began getting chest tightness and cramps like I was getting after a hard night of party-smoking or right after I quit.  Last night, it woke me up in the middle of the night and I couldn't fall back to sleep for nearly an hour - rare, but certainly not unheard of back in my smoking days.  I also still get phlegm on a pretty frequent basis, but I don't know how normal that is.

I do smoke MJ occasionally, most recently over the weekend on a ski trip - my question is, is it possible that my lungs are so healed up at this point that they're just super sensitive to any smoke now?  Is it the opposite and it's still early enough in the healing stage that periodic discomfort to be expected?  Or is there something else that might explain this?

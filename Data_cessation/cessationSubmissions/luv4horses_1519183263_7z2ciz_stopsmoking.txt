Day 50

So I'm on day 50 of quitting smoking and it is still so hard. I get cravings all throughout the day still. I relate everything to having a cigarette. I so want to have a cup of coffee in the morning and have a cigarette with it. Now I have to chew nic gum and drink coffee which is nasty!  Am I going to have to constantly go through life craving a cigarette everyday for the rest of my life?  If so, this sucks and I would rather smoke than have cravings everyday forever.

4 days completely smoke free

I started using nicotine patches two weeks ago,  but was still smoking 1-5 cigarettes a day.  I haven't smoked in four days.... But I seem to be replacing smoking with eating.  It took me a year to lose 75 lbs.  I don't want to gain the weight back. I've been eating junk food I haven't even thought about in a long time.  Ugh!

I don't want to do it anymore...

I don't want to wait for the second my daughter goes to bed so I can run out to the garage to smoke.  I don't want to jump at the chance to go to the store so I can smoke.  I don't want to go snowboarding and look for the perfect spot to inhale death while enjoying nature.  I don't want to continue lying to family/medical providers when I tell them I'm not a smoker.  I don't want to continue lying to myself when I tell myself that they cannot smell it.  No more.

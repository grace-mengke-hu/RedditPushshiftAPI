Relapsed after 4 months

I quit cocaine and cigarettes at the same time, been addicted to coke for two years and started smoking when I was thirteen, I'm 19 now and 20 soon. I am still clean from coke and was doing well with vaping until I came here to hong Kong after a miserable 12 hour flight with no sleep. I ran out of vape juice, and nicotine e liquid is illegal to buy and sell here, but cigarettes are cheap and easily accessible so bought a packet of cigarettes Because I needed the nicotine. This time, I'm doing it right, cold fucking turkey so this shit doesn't happen again, back to day one.

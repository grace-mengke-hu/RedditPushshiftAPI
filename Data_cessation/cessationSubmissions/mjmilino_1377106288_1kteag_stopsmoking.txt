I've hung half a hundred on the bitch that is smoking...and you can too!

50 days in and cruising right along. Don't really have any cravings, and the savings have been immense (about $294). All I did was read the book and really focus on it for the first few weeks.

Being a non-smoker is wonderful. I was a pack a day guy for most of the last 15 years. If I can do it, you can too.

Go forth and kick some ass people! That is all.

What helped my quit so far.

What helped me quit so far.

The nicotine tablets and esmoker. I dont use de esmoker exept for when im having a truly hard time. With the tablets I'm following thd usual program. So that I'm fighting the habit before the wothdrawl. Guess I don't have any results on how this'll work until after 3 months.
I've gone cold turkey many times before, but it never worked out.

This reddit and all the stories and support, thanks!!

Remembering how fortunate I am not having to smoke all the time whenever I see a smoker.

Seeing how smoking affects my self image. How it makes me feel insecure and weak.
Remembering that I'm a Ninja Warrior.

My daily run.

Feeling my clean teeth.
Seeing my white strong nails.
Reiking of smoke when I've visited smoker friends.

That ps4 I've promissd myself.

SOS 911 Please help me get rid of these bumps on my tongue I'm losing my mind

I know I'm overreacting bc of nicotine withdrawal. Bare with me. 

There are bumps. Tiny white bumps. They're on the tip of my tongue, and in various spots around the sides of it. They've been there for days. They hurt SO bad and I can't even sleep bc I can't stop trying to rip them off. I've cut a few off and ripped a few off. They're literally SO tiny they look like lie bumps but they're in clusters. 

Background, smoked a pack a day for 6 years quit cigs Saturday used the patch till Monday morning then cold turkey since then (it's Wednesday night as I write this) and

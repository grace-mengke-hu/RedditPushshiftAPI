Just one more thing that I am grateful for as a non-smoker.

I don’t have to brush my teeth multiple times a day. My mouth and teeth feel so much cleaner by the end of the day now that I don’t smoke. 
My pointer finger on my right hand is looking less yellow as well as my teeth.
My complexion is looking less blotchy.
I am not waking up coughing like an 80 yr old lady. 
I am not going to be in my 40’s and have that raspy asexual voice of a heavy long term smoker. 
I find that I have more time in the morning and I am never late dropping my kid off at school. 
I don’t have to stand out in the cold or the rain multiple times to get my fix. 
There are so many fantastic little things that I am appreciating as a non-smoker, besides the big obvious reasons to quit. I think it’s important to vocalize them. What are you all realizing that you are stoked about?

Struggling

I thought I was done.  I guess I was overconfident.  My smoking S.O. moved in with me temporarily 3 weeks ago, and everything was going well.  He goes outside to smoke, except sometimes in the early morning before he gets ready for work, while I'm still in bed (he thinks I don't know and can't tell, and I don't want to be a tyrant ex-smoker).  I don't know if this is what is triggering the powerful cravings I've been experiencing the last few days.  Yesterday I smoked a butt that I found in the kitchen garbage.  Later in the day I sneaked out to his car a couple of times and finished butts from the ashtray.  Somehow I rationalized that this was ok (disgusting, but ok) because I wasn't smoking a whole cigarette.  Well, today I "stole" a whole one and smoked the whole thing.  Not all at once, I put it out and relit it a few times while I was cleaning up.

I won't go into the stressful and depressing stuff we've been going through - I know it's no excuse!  I also know that my S.O. is not to blame, and I don't want him to think my relapsing is his fault. Because of other stuff that's going on, I really need and want him here with me for support.  Up until now I have been dealing just fine with the fact that he smokes.  I'm not sure why this is happening to me right now.  But smoking today felt so natural and normal, even after over 80 days without.

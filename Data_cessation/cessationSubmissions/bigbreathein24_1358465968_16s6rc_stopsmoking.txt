Wanting to smoke so badly right now.

I just learned that I got dropped from the last class I need for graduation (which is in May) because of a pre-requisite.

Having such a panic attack and my roommate is smoking in here and this craving is unbelievable. All I can think of is what kind of drink I want or what I want to smoke. It's becoming almost unbearable.

How I am quitting smoking.

1. Something I feel isn't talked about, is hands. We use it to smoke. So wash them as frequently as possible. Use some scented hand wash and smell them till you reach your hearts desire.

2. Water. Drinking water. Soda. Juices. Squash. All liquids, hydrate your body and help you think twice to fix the Nico running around.

3. Carry a pen and put it in your mouth. It may be an ill habit in public, but its way better than charring your lungs for a euphoria not worth your money. Rather look like a nervous idiot than a smelly douche.

4. If your head goes, "Would love to have one now." Allow it, but make it a quota. You're only allowed to talk to yourself about it 3 times a day.  If you still fantasize about having blackened lips, food tasting like it came out of the dishwater and coughing like you work in a brick factory then I suggest you abuse yourself for being a wimp. 

5. Be brave. You aren't the only one to feel this way. You definitely aren't the only one thinking of a relapse that will liberate your longing for nicotine. And most of all, to succeed anywhere, you need to battle the fights within and then out in the world. 

You winning this fight may seem miniscule to others, but you will be a changed person. Everyone here in this sub wants to see that changed person.

It's been a month, and this is how it feels to be empowered, without nicotine and an ashtray by my side.

I didn't even notice.

It's been four years since my last cigarette.  Four years since I've had any nicotine, for that matter.  I was one of those who never thought I could do it, smoked two packs a day, but Allen Carr's book really helped me.  You can do it, it gets easier, and after awhile you forget that you were a smoker.  Stay strong!!

How can I train myself to withstand nicotine urges during work?

I'm starting an internship in three months in the Bay Area. I'm trying to cut down on the amount of tobacco I use, because I have abused it. In addition to smoking two-three cigarettes a day, I vape continuously with 24 mg nicotine juices. 

Nicotine has consumed my life. I am only 20, but I can't go 15 minutes without taking a hit from my vape. This is mostly due to stress from exams; as an engineering studnet, I find that nicotine has been a great partner through many projects and exam study sessions. But it's been getting very bad this year. I can no longer go to libraries (like I used to) because I just get those nicotine cravings. I vape when I walk between classes, I vape in bathrooms, it's just overall not how I want to live my life. 

My internship is three months away, but I'm actually worried about how I will stand the environment where I won't be able to have nicotine for eight hours. I probably sound very unreasonable right now, but this is how my body has been conditioned this year. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Three weeks yesterday!

I was smoking about 15 a day for the last four years, and suddenly just decided to quit.

Not really sure about my motivations for doing it, but I haven't relented. Haven't really had a weak moment. I've noticed my sense of smell improving most of all. Never realised my car smelt of wet feet...

I've done the whole thing cold turkey so far, which for myself I think is probably for the best. No book either I'm sad to say.

All the best to everyone quitting smoking!

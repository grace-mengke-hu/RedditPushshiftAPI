14 days. Vaping assisted. Thanks for the help /r/stopsmoking!

So here I am. Drunk as a skunk. Usually this is when people relapse. But my friend drove me home, and we stopped at the liquor store for more beers and snacks. 

The thought of cigarettes didn't even cross my mind! I'm really surprised to be honest. 

Now to quit drinking.... that's another hurdle which I will hopefully soon overcome.

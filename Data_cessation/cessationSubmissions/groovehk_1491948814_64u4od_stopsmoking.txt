I CAN'T QUIT :(

I've smoked since I was 19 - I started later than my peers, which I'm proud of for saying no when everyone else was saying yes, but I finally succumbed myself.

I've smoked now for near on 17 years, with perhaps a one or two week break in between.  I smoke more than anyone I know, Roughly 10-15 a day (lights)

I recently moved to a country where cigarettes are 2x what i used to pay and wanted to take that oppurtunity to quit but it's been over a week now and I just can't seem to knock it on the head.

I don't even like smoking anymore, it's anti-social, expensive, makes me cough almost daily and on top of that, its reallly cold to go outside now to smoke!

Please, someone help me get started... I have strong willpower for everything else, but this I just can't seem to face up to....


(and please don't recommend Alan Carr, I've read it twice and been on the course, I'm certain it works for some types of people, but not me it seems)

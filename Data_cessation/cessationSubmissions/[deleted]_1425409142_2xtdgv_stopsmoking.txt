365 Days Smoke Free!

It seems pretty amazing now that it's been a whole year since I took the week off work, got my wife to take all my money, and sat down on the couch to play video games for a week. That week got me over the first hurdle, but being able to give kudos to other people who were quitting was a real key to helping me get over being a 'dirty smoker.' Thanks so much r/stopsmoking!

4 days, 7 hours, 31min on my 13th attempt at quitting

I've "quit" more often than I can count, but this is the most determined I've been. It's getting easier and easier to get over the pangs of withdrawal as Im glad to not be smoking instead of missing it, and the nicotine hunger dies down a little more each day. I'm hoping every day from now on is easier than the last. 

I don't really know what I'm posting here for. I'm too embarrassed to talk to my roommates and friends about it at all since I've told them I'm quitting so many times (I know). 

Anyone have any comments/questions/concerns/advice? Any stories?

I can’t stop and I need help!!

I’ve tried the quit hotline, vaping, nicotine gum, patches, cold turkey, apps, etc. etc. And nothing has stuck! I can’t make it past 3 days. I’m halfway done reading Allen Carr’s Easyway and I highly doubt it’s going to do the trick.

I’m scared that smoking is going to kill me at some point. I’ve been smoking regularly for five years but can’t make it more than a few days without a cigarette.

Any advice or encouragement would be highly appreciated. Feeling sad and desperate.

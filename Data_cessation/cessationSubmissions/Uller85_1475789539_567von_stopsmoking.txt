Just smoked my (hopefully) last Black and Mild

Been smoking on and off since I was 16. I'm turning 31 on Monday. I did the vape thing for awhile. Didn't help that much though. I'm ready to just be done. I bought 2 B&M's on the way home. Smoked one, but then I just had the urge to throw the other out the window. So I did! I have a 4 day weekend from work, which is where I always smoked the most. I hope if I can make it 4 days at home with my SO then when I go back in the office I will have the ability to keep going. I have some Dum Dum lollipops that I hope will help if I get a fit. Let's see how this goes....

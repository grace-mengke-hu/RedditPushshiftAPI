Quit on March 3rd 2018; One Month down

Even though my Smoke Free App gave me my One month badge yesterday, I am counting today as one month. 

I couldn't wait to make it here. I am proud of myself and I am surprised how much easier not smoking became after the first week or so. I tried to quit many times and was never able to get past that hump. I was pretty addicted and the withdrawal was painful and intense so I gave in. 

For others out there trying to make it through the first weeks/month, here is what worked for me:

- Cold turkey. I tried nicotine replacement/reducyion approaches (vape pen, puffer) and always ended up with a cigarette in my hand because it just wasn't the same. Maybe the gum or patch would have been better because the action of inhaling is not part of it. 

- The Smoke Free App. I paid for the full version, $5 really isn't a lot for something that can help save your life from yourself. The missions are helpful and my personal favorite is the time smoke free counter. I will be so disappointed if I have a single puff and have to reset it. 

- This subreddit. Coming here and reading and contributing has been invaluable. Thank you to everyone here that have been willing to share, you have helped me get to one month and will help keep my counter going. 

- Remember not to get cocky. Now that I feel I'm control I have to stay modest, I have slipped before. I have occasional thoughts that it would be nice to have a smoke at a cottage or on a beach, that it won't matter. N.O.P.E! Not One Puff Ever. 

Good luck to everyone here, no matter what stage you are at. We can do it.

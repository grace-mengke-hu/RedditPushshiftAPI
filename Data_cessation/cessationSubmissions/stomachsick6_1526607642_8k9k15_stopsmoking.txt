No one knows I smoke and I need to stop

I’m 19 years old and no one knows I smoke. I smoke around 5-6 cigarettes a day in private, not letting anyone see me. I feel awful about this I’m ashamed that I’m a smoker and I feel if I tell anyone now they’ll never forgive me for withholding the truth for so long. I am constantly at war with myself. I have admitted it to no one but myself, but I am a smoker. I’ve been smoking for two years and have said “this is my last pack” and made a feeble attempt at quitting more times than I can count. I struggle because no one knows about my dirty habit, so I am free from any external judgement if I go pick up a pack and smoke them - which is making cravings very hard. I know I am an awful person for the way I handled my smoking. This is the longest I’ve gone in a long time and my most successful attempt as quitting; I just passed the 48 hour mark. 

I’m having a hard time and need the support, so I felt the need to write something somewhere.

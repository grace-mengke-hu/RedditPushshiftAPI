Longest I have ever gone. I'm doing it for real and wanted to thank all of you.

I decided to give up my awful smoking habit (4 year smoker) around two weeks ago as a sort of New Years resolution (Jewish New Year that is). I've been lurking on this subreddit for about a month and can honestly say I could not have done it without the inspiration and support that all of your struggles and successes have supplied me with. You're all great and I seriously need to extend my thanks considering I haven't picked up a single cigarette since Rosh Hashanah. Thank you and keep up the quit, it is so unbelievably worth it.

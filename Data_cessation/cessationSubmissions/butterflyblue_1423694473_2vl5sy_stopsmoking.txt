I've never been on another subreddit as much as I've been here in just the last 31 days.  

To know that I'm not alone and my physical and emotional reactions to quitting have all been normal makes me feel that much stronger.  Thank you guys! 

To those of you who just quit...or are thinking of quitting... It really does get easier every day.

The day has come!

This morning something hit me while staring in the same mirror I stared at when I had my first smoke 2.5 years ago, the time has come! 

 

I've tried nicotine spray and relapsed after 2 days. Today I went cold turkey, it has been 5 hours and 29 minutes now. I'm not really "craving" anything yet, just the odd weird sensation that I could really really go for a smoke and then it just disperses after 2-5 minutes.  

 

Do you guys have any advice or helpful tips? I'm open to anything/everything. I've found that it HELPS to eat (something tasty) when I'm really wanting a smoke.

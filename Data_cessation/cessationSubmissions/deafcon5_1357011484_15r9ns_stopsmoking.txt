I quit for 10 months a few years ago. I plan on getting right this time.

I picked new year's to stop. Not because of the tired, new year's resolution thing, but because I wanted to wait until the stressful holidays were over. I quit cold turkey before and I lasted 10 months. Learned from my mistakes last time and I'm ready to get it right. Wish me luck guys!

Edit: I just hit 72 hours without touching a cigarette!! I smoked a pack a day for the last 12 years or so.

Welp, I finally picked a date, again.

Now I just have to stick to it.

Hello, I'm somethingateme.  I've been smoking for 20 years now.  I've quit a few times, but nothing was permanent.  I've been on Chantix twice, and the last time it did not take at all.  My quit day is March 1st.

I really want to quit, and I plan to go cold turkey this time.  Being a Saturday should make things easier, but it will still be rough.  I tend to smoke less on weekends.  Monday will be rough.  The department I work for at my job was recently downsized to just me, from 3.  It has been hard to deal with the stress of work and home life, but those are excuses, and I need to do this for me.

I'm tired of coughing in the morning on the ride into the office.  I"m tired of my heart racing when I try to sleep.  I'm sick and tired of not being able to ride my bike for more than 20 miles.  I used to be in shape.  I used to be healthy.

Anyway, just wanted to say hi, and ask a couple of questions.  So far, no one knows my plan, just reddit.  Should I use reddit as my guide and support, or should I tell my wife, co-workers and friends?  I don't want to mess up this time.  I want to do this.  I NEED TO DO THIS!

Any advice?

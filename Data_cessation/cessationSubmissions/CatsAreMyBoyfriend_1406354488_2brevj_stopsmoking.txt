Things I have noticed in the last two weeks of quitting

I was thinking about this earlier and I wanted to make a list. Figured this is the best place to put it.


-I still love driving with my windows down and it doesn't make me crave a smoke. It's just pure joy in a simple thing.

-My car is cleaner

-I'm not as nauseous in the mornings

-I'm not worried about smelling like smoke around anybody and not having the guilt is wonderful

-No more worrying about if I have enough smokes to get through the day

-Every time I give myself any sort of permission to smoke (usually in the form of 'when I've gone so long without smoking, or if this happens), I end up telling myself 'how cool would it be if I made it through that too?'...and it has worked.

-I have an appetite. This is a big deal for me as a crohn's patient. 
-There are still some challenges I am facing with quitting. But I can overcome them all.


There's my list. I might add as I continue on this journey. Thank you, /r/stopsmoking. This is where I come when I am most tempted and it always helps. I hope you enjoyed me little list.

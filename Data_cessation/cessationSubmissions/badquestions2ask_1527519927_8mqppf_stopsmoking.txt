I quit smokeless tobacco

I did it. Cold turkey. Been three months. I have dipped for 30 odd years.

Here is my trick: I had a mouth guard that I cut up. One to fit my front teeth and one to fit my side teeth. Kept it in my pocket at all time. 

Every time I unconsciously reached into my pocket for a can, I remembered I donâ€™t chew and I pulled out a mouth guard and chewed on that.

Did that for about a month.

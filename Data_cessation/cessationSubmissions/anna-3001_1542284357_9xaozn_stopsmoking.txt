day 10

Stopped 10days ago and itâ€˜s getting easier. Just a few questions to the ones that quitted a while ago:
Does anyone else have this weird feeling of anxiety when thinking about never ever smoking again?
Anyone else gets more and more curious about what would happen if youâ€˜d just inhale once ?
Thanks ðŸ˜Š

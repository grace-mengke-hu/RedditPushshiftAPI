Need help constantly dizzy/feeling light headed

It seems after about 13 hours of no smoking I get light headed or dizzy. Every few minutes or so if I'm not doing anything. If I'm doing something they come more frequently and more intense. Last I quit it didn't start till like end of day 2. Now I smoke to make it stop. Any tip?

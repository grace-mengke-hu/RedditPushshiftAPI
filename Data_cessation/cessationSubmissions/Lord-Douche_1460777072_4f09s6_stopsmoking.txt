Third week is the worst so far

I feel like nothing is worth doing or planning for, eating is a chore, nothing is good, bad things are very bad and good things are barely tolerable.

Signs of me hitting a rough patch, a micro depressive state of sorts, barely think about it during the day and slowly but surely as the day goes by, I get more and more irritated, until 8pm rolls around and I can't tolerate myself.

I know it gets better, it will.
Right now though, nothing is good, everything just "is".
And it's driving me mad. 
Still not gonna smoke.

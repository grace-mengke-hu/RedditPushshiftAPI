Fifth Day Smoke Free

So...my husband and I quit together on the 25th. I had the WORST evening yesterday. Basically everything went to poop in the span of maybe one hour.

I didn't smoke.

I'm using the patches. Unfortunately, I keep hearing from people that that means I'm not really quit. The way I see it, the patches keep the physical part of the nicotine addiction at bay long enough to deal with the behavioral/mental addiction. In my case, that's the strongest part of my addiction.

I keep forgetting that I've quit though, and then tell myself I can have a cigarette when I'm done the dishes, finish the dishes, and remember I don't have any because I quit. I know how ridiculous that sounds, but my brain is ridiculous to begin with.

Unfortunately, I used to use cigarettes to motivate myself to do things I had to do (if I do my memory training today/rehab stuff, I can have one cigarette! If I do the dishes without breaking any, I can have a cigarette etc)

I haven't gained any weight, but I went down 3.6 lbs since the 25th despite sitting around on the couch. Not much of an appetite though.

Anyone have any tips for keeping myself motivated to do the things I have to do without rewarding myself with cigarettes? I'm not a foodie, so candy wouldn't work (and it isn't healthy anyway). 

My other issue is kind of embarrassing because I'm 25 years old, but I suck my thumb. If I don't smoke, I chew on it and well, I am kind of chewing it raw. I hate chewing gum (the texture is weird, and it hurts my jaw), but I do grind my teeth, while awake more than asleep...

oh, and rehab is for a brain injury that affects my memory and personality (it has made me ridiculously docile), and language, and to some extent cognitive function (IQ dropped 17 points, but is still above average, I just have trouble following instructions without losing focus and forgetting the first step)

Stopped 01/01/2018, without withdrawl??!

     About five years now, atempts with the medicine ( Bupropion) wich almost helped me. Last year for two atempts of 10 days each I stopped, but some problems dragged me again to the addction.

     But now, I strangely don't miss the cigarr though.
Was the promisse I'd have make on 00:00 of last year helped? 
I'm now happy, some colateral effects though, 

Tingling in the tongue. I am a very anxious person, and last year at the end of the year I was drinking too much alcohol. Which, as incredible as it may seem, I also stopped.

Well, going now for the third day without smoking, and I'm so much more confident than I've been whole year!

a month in, depressed, tired, anxious, reflux x 100, irritable, pissed off.

Why does the last few days feel like the first days again? F###!!!! Anyone else in this same fucking shithole I'm in?

I thought things would be way better a month in, but it's not. After searching this sub I can see that I'm not the only one, but it feels like I'm alone.

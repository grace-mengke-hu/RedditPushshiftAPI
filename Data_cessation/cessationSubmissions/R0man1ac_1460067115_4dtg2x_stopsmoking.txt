Today is fourteen days.

Fourteen days without a cigarette. I feel pretty great. I've definitely been here a few times before. I've been "quitting" for a long time now. 

I quit for two years the first attempt. Started smoking again after having one puff. Smoked for another year or so, and said it was enough. Quit for six months. Started again after a rough chain of events. Stopped for about four months. Then again for another two. Lately my quits have been less than one week. So I'm pretty happy with where I am at now. 

Each time I've relapsed, I've learned something new. So I am keeping a positive attitude. This last time I quit, I read Allan Carrs book. I was definitely skeptical. Didn't think a book would help me quit any more than it did when I quit for two years. (didn't even know this book existed back then). But I can say that I feel it's stuck this time. 

The work days have been the hardest recently. I always talked myself into caving somehow on my way to work, or on my way home from work. Today on my way to work, I stopped at the gas station for coffee and saw someone smoking. Usually I would be jealous, envious even. Today I didn't feel that way at all. Of course it crossed my mind, but left just the same. I don't feel the need to smoke anymore. I'm hoping to keep this mindset forever. 

One thing stands true, I won't relapse this time around. My future depends on it.

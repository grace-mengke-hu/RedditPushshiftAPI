Thinking about quitting. Yeah, just thinking.

Hello everyone, complete newb here. 

It is my 42 birthday and it is time to quit. In many other areas of my life I find it is really helpful to start reading, thinking, writing and generally immersing myself in the topic I am trying to tackle. So I am doing that starting with this post. I need to quit. 

Any advice would be appreciated.

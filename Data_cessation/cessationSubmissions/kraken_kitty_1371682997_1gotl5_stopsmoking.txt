I had to make a choice

I started smoking again.  I had a breakdown.



My emotional and psychological well-being was suffering . . . goddamit, even my physical well-being!  I wasn't eating, I wasn't sleeping, I had lost weight since I had quit because I wasn't eating AT ALL.



This doesn't mean I'm giving up . . . I'll never quit quitting.  I've never had this amount of stress in my life before, and I just don't think this was the right time.  After the summer, after I drop about 3 things off of my plate, THEN I'll try again.  I will have a smoke-free house.



... I think I just need someone to tell me I didn't completely and utterly fail D:

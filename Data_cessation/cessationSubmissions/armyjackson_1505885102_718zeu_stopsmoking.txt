It's been 393 days Nicotine Free, a tip

The first 100 days of being fully nicotine free were so bad that I felt the need deep in my bones.  It was so horrible, I was sure that I'd be unable to ever feel right again without that nicotine in my system. 
I do feel right again.  I didn't need it to feel like my normal self,.  That's it.  It's all different for everyone.  
But for me, personally.. staying nicotine free during those first 100 days was the hardest.    
I have nightmares that I accidentally smoke again, and know I have to face that 100 days again.

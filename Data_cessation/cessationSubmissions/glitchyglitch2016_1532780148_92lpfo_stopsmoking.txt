1 whole day! Champix is finally kicking in :)

So about 2 hours ago represented 24 hours of not smoking. I have been on champix (chamtix or something similar in other countries) for a week today and I could feel it starting to work on about day 4. So far so good, wish me luck! PS - How do you get one of those flair thingy's?

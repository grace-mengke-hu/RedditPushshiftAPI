4 days in...

I have tried many times to quit but failed. I don’t want that to happen this time. I’m tired of feeling tired all of the time! The cravings are strong tonight but I refuse to give in! ...Even though I feel like I could literally eat a cigarette right now... it’s not worth it. I know I would be right back to smoking even more than before. I just keep telling myself “I’m a non smoker. I’m a non smoker.”

What withdrawal symptoms (side effects) have you had from quitting?

I quit cold turkey, not by choice, but for medical reason. Trust me when I say this is the best thing ever. I have always hated smoking. The smell the cost the feeling of yuckiness. But the side effects are killing me. I feel like I need to cough, but it is only a dry cough and not a bad cough at all. I feel like I have a lump in my throat. My body aches and all I want to do is sleep. My anxiety is out of this world. I keep checking my oxygen levels to make sure I am ok. Oh Lordy this has been a journey!!

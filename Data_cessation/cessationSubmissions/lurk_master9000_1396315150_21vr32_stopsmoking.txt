3 weeks today!

Hello stopsmoking! I've been reluctant to post because I felt my quit time wasn't that impressive and not really an example that anyone can quit. Either way, it's been 3 weeks since my last ciggy and my lungs and heart are thanking me tremendously! I'm glad I made the change, hope everyone out there is staying strong and **smoke free**!

Update - 1 week.

I honestly didn't think I would even get this far when I posted here last week, but now its been a full week and I have gone without a smoke. No cigarettes, no vaping, no quit smoking aids.

There's tons of support here and I had a few people offer to just talk if I needed an outlet, and I do appreciate it. This is something I've wanted to do for a long time, I've done it before but for different reasons I started up again. The most obvious fallback answer is to just tell yourself that you were really stressed out and it helps to calm your nerves. Its true, I know most of us felt that way at one point, but it just started to consume me and my day to day habits.

So far its been behavioral modification. It used to be, smoke when driving, smoke after eating, smoke when feeling stressed, smoke before bed... Smoking became a reward for just going through my day to day life. I'm still coughing up the phlegm that built up, but its much less often now than it was just a week ago.

So here's my cheers to anyone else trying to quit. If you believe you can, you will. No need to make yourself an excuse. Become better for yourself.

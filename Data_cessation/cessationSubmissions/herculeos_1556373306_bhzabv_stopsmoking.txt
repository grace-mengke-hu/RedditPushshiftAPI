Day 6 - Freedom!

It's still going well, I've not smoked for 6 days (and 4 hours), and I feel that I hardly have any cravings, which is great. If it were still hard than I'd accept it too, because I realize what I am acquiring by quitting smoking - ***freedom***!

First, it gives me **psychological freedom**. The nicotine has hijacked me in a way, it made me a slave to my urges. Rationally, I never wanted to smoke, and even less so when I realized how it was slowly making me more and more addicted and how hard it was to get out of it, all the while realizing that it was slowly destroying my health. Having broken this cycle, the neurological pathways that enabled my addiction are starting to break down (or alternative pathways are forming) and my brain is once again learning that life without nicotine is fine too, in fact for most of my life I have not smoked and never thought of smoking, so I am going back to that state. I realize that my brain will never fully un-learn the tendency to crave for nicotine, but it will definitely become 100x less strong as time passes and as my lifestyle further improves. Eventually, smoking will just seem like a weird thing I did in the past, something I can't imagine myself doing (except for a rare occasion, a few times per year, when I have a craving - but having to spend something like 15 minutes per year feeling some discomfort when you have to resist this urge is a small price to avoid all the negatives that continuing smoking would do to my life.

Fortunately, I made it out before any significant permanent damage. I can still do my rock climbing and triathlons, and expect to do well, so that's great. So, **physically**, I am much more free than I was 6 days ago, and as I am healing that freedom is growing. I see my health as a very fundamental part of my wellbeing, and I do not want to squander it for simple pleasure.

Third, it helps me attain **financial freedom**. I spent something like 1000-2000 euros on smoking per year, that boggles my mind! Now I am saving that money. My future self will be thankful for that.

Moving on, I will continue to increase my freedom in other ways. I will find other ways to decrease my spending, I will unlearn other habits that hijack my autonomy (most importantly, spend less time on the internet) and will do things to improve my health (eat better, exercise, etc).

Now, it's great to have more freedom, but it's also important to appreciate that and to use this freedom well. So, I am also taking time to meditate, to reflect, to journal and to have conversations with a mentor and a psychologist in order to find out what I really value, and what my needs are for a healthy and meaningful life.

Good luck on your journey! I love reading your stories as well, I get a lot of inspiration from what I read here! :)

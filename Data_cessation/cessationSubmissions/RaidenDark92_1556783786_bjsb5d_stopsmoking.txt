So I Guess this Is it.

Hey guys I Hope you all Are doing well, it has been almost four weeks that I stopped smoking. And here I am sitting in waiting room at my local hospital, shaking like a dog. I quit smoking after fourteen years, I'm getting in for chest x-ray, there is nothing more scary than for me than this.

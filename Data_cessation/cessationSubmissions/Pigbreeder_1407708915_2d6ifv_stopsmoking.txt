Day 11.

I am feeling so much better for this decision, I found it really difficult on the weekend, drinking with friends at a bar. I however resisted the urge... The extra energy I have has to be my favourite part of the quitting experience. Even tho it is hard, looking for those positives definitely makes it worth it!

New Sub: r/stopsmokingwtf

Hello r/stopsmoking. 
[Here is a new sub](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmokingwtf) to post all your WTF images and links that continually reinforce that quitting is a good idea. 

Please feel free to peruse [past wtf posts for content.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/search?q=smoking&restrict_sr=on) Help a fledgling sub and gain some karma. 

Also, we are in need of a few extra mods so if you are interested, please PM me with some of your ideas and I will gladly add you.

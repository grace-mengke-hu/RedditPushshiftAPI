Red red wine...

Day 3: We decided to have some wine with dinner and I was scared because alcohol always triggers a relapse for me. I was craving a smoke so bad. It was all I could think of the whole time. I even bought cigarettes.  I even went so far as to take one out of the packet and put it in my pocket. But I did not smoke. Thank goodness! One more day.

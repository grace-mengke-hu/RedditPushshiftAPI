Did i do a mistake?

I havenâ€™t smoked for last 5 days and today i just bought a 0.1 mg nicotine cigarette pack. Smoked one with coffee. My plan was maximum only one cigarette in a day. Did i do a mistake? 

Bonus question: How much nicotine make us addictive again? 

Thank you and good luck everyone

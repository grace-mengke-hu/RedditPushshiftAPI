Pack a day for 4 years. I'm closing on 72 hours smoke free.

5 years ago I quit.

3 years ago I started back up.

Tuesday I started on my second week of Chantix and finished off the rest of my pack.

Haven't smoked since. I've been loath to say anything to anyone about it cause I don't wanna make myself lax. The first 3 days are supposed to be the worst. 

The biggest challenge for me has been driving. I chainsmoke when I drive, so I'm trying to figure out what to do now instead. It's the only time I've been truly irritable from wanting a cigarette.

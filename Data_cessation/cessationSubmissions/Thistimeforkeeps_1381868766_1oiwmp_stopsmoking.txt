Two weeks and feeling great!!

The thing that's keeping me going is my phone app that's telling me how my health compares to someone who has never smoked.  Already my oxygen levels/ carbon monoxide levels/ energy is the same as someone who has never smoked.  BUT I still only have 0.80% normal risk of a heart attack than someone who has never smoked.  
Heart problems run in my family.  I want to have a better chance of beating the odds.  Every time I crave I look at my app.

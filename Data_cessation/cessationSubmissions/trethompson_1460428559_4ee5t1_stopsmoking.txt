Dealing with digestive problems when quitting?

Hi all! Two weeks ago I decided I was done with cigarettes. I knew my cravings would be pretty bad ( was a pack a day Newport smoker for the past 4 years) so I bought a vape, some 3mg nicotine juices (extremely low, so it would be more or less equal to using other methods) and set myself to it. While things have been alright so far and cravings don't flare up too badly, I'm having some pretty severe digestive problems. From what I've heard I figured I would run into these, but so far I haven't heard any ways to deal with them besides eating lots of fruit and high fiber foods. While I'm attempting to do that, I dont have a lot of time to cook so I still have to survive off fast food a lot. Does anyone have any other tips on how to deal with this?

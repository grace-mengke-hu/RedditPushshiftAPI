Lowered nic from 35mg to 6mg, rough but feels do able

I'm going to go down to 1 cigarette today as well hopefully. And I've been lowering for about 2-3 weeks now. My plan is to be done with smoking before my 20th birthday in January, but it looks like it will be much sooner.

I'm starting to feel anxious, I usually need a smoke around 4 hours. I last smoked right before bed, but I woke up early, this is still the longest I've gone without a cig, 8 hours but I've been awake for 3 of those hours. And no smoking doesn't affect my sleep it's been a problem.

I'm using Reddit in hopes that it will stop cravings some. Thank you so much guys for all the support.

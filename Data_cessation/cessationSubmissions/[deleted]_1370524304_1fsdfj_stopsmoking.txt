So it has been a month already!?! WOW!!

I cannot believe that I finally took the plunge to quitting smoking about a month ago! I feel fantastic!! I was unsure of weather or not I would be able to do it, but with the support of my family, friends, coworkers and bf, I have the power to quit! Granted, a few cravings still come every once in awhile, but it's much easier to get through them now. Driving is not an awkward smoke-less chore for me anymore, and I can smell everything again!

I wish you all the best in your quitting smoking endeavors as well! We can all do this!!

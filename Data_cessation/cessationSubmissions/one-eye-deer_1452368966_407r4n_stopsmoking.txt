Second time quitting, five days in so far.

I did the financials for the amount of money I was wasting on them in my state, and the number made me sick. I could easily drop $30-$40+ a week on them. That's over $120-$160+ a month I was burning away. I have student loans to pay, money to save, travel funds to fill...couldn't believe it. 

I probably would have gone through 2-3 packs in 5 days at this point, so I'm on track to saving my first $30. Cold turkey hasn't been too horrible. My boyfriend has been supportive and affirmative each time I bring up getting through a new day. Trying to keep my mind and body sound as it goes through the motions of withdrawing from nicotine, and keep myself from caving to a craving. Have a huge test tonight that involves a very long drive (one of my smoking triggers), so I'm hoping to find some ways to keep my hands and mind occupied during that time.

So glad I found this sub, and I've enjoyed reading some of the stories. If you have any tips for a 2nd time newbie, please send them my way!

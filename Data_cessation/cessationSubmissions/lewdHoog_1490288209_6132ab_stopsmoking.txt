After many failed attempts, I think I've finally stuck the landing. Some thoughts!

Just about three months without smoking and I feel great! I understand that anything can happen, and I could be smoking again tomorrow... but right now I am just worrying about today. I think I have that covered. 

Anyway, I’ve tried quitting a bunch of times over the last eighteen months with little success. But now, after taking it much more seriously and changing things up a bit, I think I’ve got this.

Some things I did differently this time:
     -Avoided alcohol completely for the first 90 days. This was somewhat difficult to do, since I am a university student (UCSD Tritons what’s good?!) and many of my friends are drinking almost every weekend. However, I think this was the major change. During previous attempts at this, nearly every relapse event had alcohol involved. Crazy night out with the boys, few beers by myself at home... it was the common theme. 
     -For the first month I did not associate myself with anybody that smokes. Period. This was another big trigger for me; university can be stressful, and I knew that smoking a cigarette could help me deal with whatever was going on. However, I did not indulge. Big part of this recent success.
     -I’ve been running a ton. I have been a habitual exerciser for a few years now (I am 23), but I’ve always focused on weight training. Now that my lungs are starting to get better, running 3-4 times a week has really helped me stay solid with my quit; I can vividly feel my lungs improving week by week. I am still coughing/wheezing more than I would like, but I know that’s just part of this whole process. 
     -I browse this sub. A lot. I think daily browsing of this sub (in addition to reading articles, watching videos, etc) really helps. Keeps this whole thing on the front of my mind.
     - I’ve been much more accountable about the process. I started dating the girl I’m seeing about a month into this quit, and having her along for the ride has helped immensely. Also, my siblings and closest friends are constantly making sure I have this under wraps. 

Problems that still persist:
     - Constipation/stomach problems are still a thing. Some days it’s fine, other days it’s miserable.
     - Sleeping can be difficult from time to time. I haven’t been on a solid schedule at all since I quit. This will get better overtime. Melatonin helps.
     - Irritability can be off the charts, especially during crunch time at school. I’ll find myself getting angry/irritated/annoyed over the most trivial stuff. The other day I yelled at my roommate because he left an empty LaCroix can on the kitchen counter.

The big three benefits:
     - Having an extra $35-40 a week is really nice. That’s dinner for me and my chick, or a tank of gas, or groceries. 
     - Too many health/”quality of life” benefits to count. I can focus better (after a rough first month), have sex better, exercise harder. I don’t smell like garbage anymore. I don’t need to get up from my desk while studying every 45-60 minutes. 
     - It’s a huge accomplishment that I feel proud about every damn day. Even if everything else in a span of twenty four hours is complete crap, knowing that I made it through another day without smoking is huge.

Tl;dr --> I think I’ve got this for good, but I will stay humble because I know I can fuck this up at any point. If you’re on the fence, trust me... it’ll be the best decision you ever make.

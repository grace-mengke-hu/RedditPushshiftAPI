Seems like a great community to start this journey.

Have been smoker for 8 years now with several tries to quit. At this point in my life I feel like smoking is killing me mentally, physically and to some degree financially. I do feel that if I can once and for all quit, it could turn my life around as funny it may sound to someone. Going to request a badge and downloaded a "Smoke Free" app. Have to start somewhere. Just finished my last cigarette.

Good luck to fellow journey starters.

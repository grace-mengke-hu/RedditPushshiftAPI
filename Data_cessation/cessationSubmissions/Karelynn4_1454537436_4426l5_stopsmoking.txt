Day 13

So, I am very new to this whole quitting thing. I quit cold turkey 13 days ago after smoking for 18 years. As the days go by, I feel like I want to crawl the walls! It's actually worse emotionally! I thought the very beginning would be the hardest days, but they weren't. I sat on my kitchen floor last night with an unlit cigarette and and almost cried I wanted one so bad. Good grief, I am crazy lol.  Any advice? Am I completely nuts?

Tips for concealing nicotine patch?

I'm in college and I find it easy to conceal the patch when I'm at school. How can I conceal it when at home? I figure I can hide the patch itself by placing it on a part of the body no one will see and/or putting a bandaid over it. However, I'm very worried that someone at home will find my "stash". Can you get one without any printed label on it, so it could be mistaken for a bandage? I'm just worried that, given the length of summer break coming up, it's more or less statistically inevitable that I will be caught. That would start a shitstorm. However, nothing, not counseling, meds, anything, has helped my depression and insomnia like nicotine. I know it's not medically advisable, but I have no intention of stopping using nicotine patches. Without them, I can't focus on crap and my memory is like I'm 20 going on 90. I know family would be disappointed in me though, so I don't want them to know about this. I'm open with them about every other area of my life.

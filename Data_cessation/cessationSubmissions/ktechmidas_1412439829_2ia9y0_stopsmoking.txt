Cold turkey wasn't as bad as I thought

I've been smoking for about 3 years now with few attempts to quit here and there which all failed. I think we have to be mentally ready for the quit, don't decide to quit straight after a cig - instead decide on a morning before you have your first. I quit primarilly for health reasons but also monetary reasons.

I tried a trial quit... quit two weeks ago on Monday and ended up caving on Friday and having a 10-pack - terrible I know but I knew that wasn't it, it was a trial for myself to see how long I could last. The first time round I just felt myself craving and having headaches but mostly managed to keep concentrated on work.

I gave it a real go on Sunday after finishing that 10-pack - I thought I would miss the smoke break at work but I got over that in my trial quit anyway, it's amazing how quickly our minds get used to something. It's now 6 days later and I've confirmed for myself that this is a permanent quit, I've lasted all of the week and most of the weekend. The withdrawal didn't hit me very hard at all, just a few pangs here and there of "cig time!" - I did up my caffeine consumption quite a bit to make up for it though, that just kind of naturally happened....il work on that once I'm over this one :P

The only way I was ever going to do it was cold turkey, I'm glad there are products out there to help people but for me it had to be all or nothing.

Getting really fat

I've been smokefree since half of august. Managed to put on about 20 kilograms (about 3 stone) Considering my whole weight used to be about 7 stone (45 kg) you can imagine how I am feeling: horribly fat and ugly.

I really don't feel like I'm eating that much more than I used to?
Anyone else?

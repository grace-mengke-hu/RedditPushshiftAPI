Today marks 3 years!

As evident from the title today marks three years since my last cigarette. Actually 3 years and a day cause I quit on March 3 2013. This has been the best decision in my life of 26 years so far and I'm so glad that I made it hat far. 

Thank you all for being such a supportive community!

I respect you guys.

You guys might find this silly... I know there are some heavy duty smokers trying to quit so my case in comparison is... laughable... but still.

I never smoked THAT much. I was a social smoker, only when I got drunk, and that was five or six times a month. Since I didn't smoke *that* much, I figured I could quit whenever.

I haven't smoked in 7 months. Holllllyyyy shiiiiitttt it's been hard. Just last night I had to throw my car keys into my closet so that by the time I found them again, I would have talked myself out of it. It's like an itch in my *bones* that I can't. fucking. scratch. I want to smoke. I want. a fucking. cigarette. It doesn't seem to be getting easier... But I look on the time I've held off.. It seems like it would be a waste. 

Sorry if it seems superfluous... I just wanted to vent.

Edit: Sorry, forgot about my title! Ha. I used to think that 'how hard can it be? You just stop smoking. Bam.' which is why I saw no harm in doing it in the first place. Fuck, man, if I'm having this amount of trouble with a *very* light habit, how about who smoked everyday? Good on you, people.

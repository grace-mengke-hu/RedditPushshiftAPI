Just found this sub, after 4 years of smoking i am ready to challenge myself.

For about two weeks i have been working out to improve my health life style, and due to that i tried to smoke as less as possible because it was hard to breath while working out/running.
What it gave me is that i started to think more CLEAR, more clear about my life and my problems and view things differently.
What it also gave me is that every deep breath i took actually satisfied my lungs!
Stopping to smoke for me is pretty hard i am pretty addicted to cigarettes, that’s why i smoke a lot again, sometimes even after a workout (its bad yes). 

But from the experience of smoking less and working out more I understood that i felt better not only physically but mentally. 

I want to start a smoke free challenge and really stick to it. I hope i will make it, i am really addicted to cigarettes. Especially after a break up i recently had, i would smoke a pack a day, if not more ... 

I’m happy i found this sub and i will post more about my experience 

Thanks for reading and comments would be appreciated!

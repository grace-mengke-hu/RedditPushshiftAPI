Trying to stop while I'm ahead.

I've only been a smoker for about five months. Not a long time, but long enough. Long enough for cigarettes to get into my head and mess around up there. As of three days ago, I'm "trying to quit". I had one cigeratte the first day, one the second, two yesterday, and one and a half today. 

I wouldn't say I'm surprised I haven't been able to quit cold turkey. I find it interesting how the cravings sneak up on me. I'll be fine for a while, then eventually I go "hey, I'd usually have a cigeratte right about now". 

I have a vape that I've been using, and I have a question for other vape users. How much of a difference does the nicotine level actually make? I've never really noticed a difference between the no nicotine and nicotine juices, but I'm starting to feel like my 0 mg juice just isn't cutting it.

How do you handle emotional situations?

Hello everyone,

I am currently on my third time quitting, I really hope that this time it sticks. Last night was particularly tough for me because I was mad about something and I got ready to go out an buy some.

Any time I have any kind of emotional situation, even fairly mild ones, this is when it is most difficult to curb the cravings. And it's not just negative emotions, I if I am really happy or excited, I could also happily chain smoke all night.

Any advice or coping strategies for what to do in these moments? If it is day-time and weather permits, I try to go for a walk and walk it off. But that isn't always an option for me. Your input would be appreciated! Thanks!

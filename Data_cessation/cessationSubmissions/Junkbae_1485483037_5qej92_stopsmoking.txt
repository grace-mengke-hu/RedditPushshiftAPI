Having trouble quitting... Advice?

Hey all,
To give a bit of backstory I'm 28 and have been an on/off smoker for about a decade. I smoked only when drinking when I was younger, but went through a few of years of serious partying when I was 19-23 where I would drink most weekends. I could easily go through a pack a night. 

I've then been a daily smoker for about 5 years now, never exeeding 10 a day, an average of 6 or so.

I got diagnosed w/ ADHD a couple of months ago and started taking Concerta (basically amphetamine for those unfamiliar) it's been wonderful for my ADHD, but it's made me want to smoke near constantly. With a lot of restraint I'm limiting myself to about 8 per day.

I hate this and I want to quit. I both crave the nicotine and I use a cigarette as reward. At work, I'll reward myself with a cigarette break every now and then throughout the day.

I'm quitting on February 1st, but I know I will be miserable and have a lot of trouble with self-restraint. I made the decision early this month to slowly wind down to be able to quit more comfortably on the date. However I haven't been able to. The fewest I've smoked per day in January is 4 and I just went through 8 today.

I appreciate that if I wanna quit, I just have to do it... But if it were so easy we wouldn't have this subreddit :p

Any advice on what I can do at work and in the evenings when the cravings are killing me and literally possessing my every thought? 

Thanks!!

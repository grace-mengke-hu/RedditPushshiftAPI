Thank you all but I must say good bye.

Several months ago I started my journey on quitting smoking and thanks to the miracles of modern pharmacopeia I quit with ease. 

I've been out to bars, had long car rides and even went outside on my break with some smoking co-workers and the only time I really think about smoking myself is when I see threads from here.

Thank you all for your help and best of luck with those still struggling to quit as well  but for my own good I will be clicking the unsubscribe button.

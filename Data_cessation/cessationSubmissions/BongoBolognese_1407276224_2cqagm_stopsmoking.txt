Zombie-Like Actions you do not Control

I am doing pretty well after one month, however I have noticed something. Although I don't have cravings as often as in the beginning, my subconscious is still playing tricks on me.

I am working at home a lot, sitting at my desk doing smart stuff ;) I never smoked inside my house since my gf hates it. Whenever I wanted to smoke I left the house and smoked in the backyard. After 30 days I don't think about smoking constantly, however I tend to stand up from my desk and leave my room, just to wonder what the hell I wanted to do. I am standing there, thinking about why I stood up. Today it came to me: My subconscious is steering me like a zombie! I stand up to smoke and I am confused because I have learned that I do not smoke anymore.

It's a weird feeling. Anyone else experienced it?

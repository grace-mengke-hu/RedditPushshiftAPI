Day 5, Much better than anticipated!

I was super worried about this being the first weekend not smoking (I quit on Monday evening). Today went well. I didn't want to sit idle so I cleaned a lot. At least the house will stay clean if I keep this up. Lol. I also had my first drink of alcohol since quitting smoking and so far so good!

Day four.

I'm on day four of quitting after a whole year of a pack a day smoking. I had found that it was much easier to not smoke at all the day I decided to smoke, so i picked a day where my pack was down to it's end and said I would smoke these last 5 "tomorrow" and the next day quit. (Days also correlated with my last final)

I've been going through this Sub and learned a lot, for example I don't dream much and the past 2 days have dreamt each night, one night is a rare occurrence for me, 2 in a row is unheard of. Staying busy constantly and not having cigarettes near me (Tough since people at work smoke) have been the biggest things that have detered me from smoking. 

I feel I'm going to start having issues now, last time I tried to quit I made it 2 weeks before I caved in and this time around my roommate (smoker) isn't being very supportive he dropped this line "Why're you quitting? You'll just start back up again in 2 weeks anyway." So I've kind of been trying to avoid that situation with a lot of working which I was thankfully scheduled for. 

I have noticed that I haven't coughed up anything nasty in the past 3 days, I used to have a bad problem with coughing stuff up, once it was frothy and really worried me which is part of why I decided to quit. 

Sorry for the rant just needed to get this off my chest, a quick question, what have y'all found to be the best ways to avoid the cravings? I will say I feel I'm lucky deciding to quit only 1 year in instead of 20 later like some people here and it's making it easier for me.

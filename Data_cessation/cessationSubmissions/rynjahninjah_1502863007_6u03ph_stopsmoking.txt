I can't believe it's already been one month

This is the 2nd time i've hit the one month mark and my next goal is to make it till the end of the year.

Few things I've noticed and plan to work on however, on nights out for drinks i'd have one more bottle of beer than normal and I started snacking a bit more at night, both times when i'd used to be smoking.

I'm going to try reduce my nights out drinking and replace it with water and exercise. I've had one urge this month, but i'm thankful to have a great buddy who talked me out of it.

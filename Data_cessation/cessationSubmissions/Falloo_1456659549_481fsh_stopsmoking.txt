Finally clicked!

I've been hanging out here for the last couple of weeks, getting advice and information, trying to psych myself up for quitting once and for all. It has been really hard every time I've gone cold turkey in the past, and there have been many attempts. Withdrawal and a bad attitude have made life hell and parenting my kids nearly impossible. I was in a cycle of failing and hating myself. 
Anyway, something finally clicked. I was in the middle of telling myself I couldn't possibly quit this week because my husband is going away and I'll have the kids to myself... And then it hit me how disappointed I was treat I'd have to wait. So I decided not to wait and I'm 13 hours in and feeling the most positive I have in a long time. It feels different his time, like all that info has finally sunk in and my body has caught up with my brain (if that makes sense). This time it's for real and for keeps - I've even got myself a badge now (which I've not done before because of all the failing). 
I'm doing this! I'm actually doing this!!!!

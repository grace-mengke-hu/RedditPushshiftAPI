Nobody left for me to turn to and no idea what to do, mother does not have any more lisinopril and is on the verge on dying, what the fuck do I do?

Well I have officially ran out of ideas reddit. My mother is a chronic smoker + occasional drinker and I've exhausted everything i'm my power to fix her. Family doesn't seem to give a damn and to be honest she's so stubborn I dont' see why they should. She's become so complacent that she doesn't even realize she needs to go refill her lisinopril script before she fucking DIES. She is definitely considered mentally ill and has a host of problems...

- seizure prone

- leg edema, seriously, she thinks it's because of stress. SIGH...

- hoarder

- talks to self

- some kind of heart defect, no idea on the name

and so forth, is the government able to do anything about this?? She is obviously not able to think for herself so what do I do reddit.. She is going to die within 4 months if she doesn't fix this problem, her blood pressure was around 210/145 before she got on the lisionpril.

- 49 years old

- 5'10

- 170-175, very little LBM

out of shape as can be...

Don't know anymore reddit, what would you do? Call the god damn mental ward?

day 4 - help

Guys, today I'm TOTALLY depressed. No meaning in nothing. No motivation at all. Crazy thoughts. But fortunately no cravings for sigarettes. 
Need help

EDIT: one of the worst thing that I'm thinking is that I have no motivation in doing nothing productive because in past, when I was working or studying or everything else, I used to reward myself to light a cig. Now my brain focuses only on this thing and make my thoughts about life VERY grey.

It's been three days and I feel like shit

It's been three days and I feel like shit!!!! I'm 35 and I've been smoking since I was 16.  My  seven year old looked at me and asked me to stop, I couldn't say no and I love him more then fucking cigarettes so here I am. I'm experiencing a few withdrawal symptoms, my sleep pattern is all jacked up... I'm very lethargic, I feel nauseous, and my head feels foggy, but I'm here and I'm doing it. Does anyone have any encouraging words? Please

Triple digits

I'm at the point now where I pretty much never think about smoking.  I don't even open my quit app much anymore but am up to $900 saved.  When the thought of a cigarette does cross my mind now it's not in the form of a craving but more of I can't believe I had that awful habit for so long.  

So today I come back to this sub for the first time in a little while and saw that 100 number.  Such a nice little victory to celebrate.  Life as a non-smoker, not being a slave, is so much better.

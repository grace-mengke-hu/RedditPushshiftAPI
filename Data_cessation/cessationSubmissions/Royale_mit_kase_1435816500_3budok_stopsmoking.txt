A month and a half later, I still want to smoke, and am seriously contemplating it.

I quit on May 18th 2015, I smoked for around 6 months give or take and at my height I smoked around 15 a day. I gave up pot and drinking as well. Mostly because I feared that I would end up a loser just like all of my other friends who smoked and drank away their high school years, i'm 16 btw. But now I miss it a lot, and I hear this goes on for a very long time. There are people who haven't smoked for years who still have a desire to smoke. I always told myself that it wouldn't kill me and that i'd quit before I turned 18, but my life since quiting feels so empty and boring. What should i do?

I want to quit but don’t know where to start.

I’m sick and tired of nicotine having a hold on me. It’s quite literally ruining my life. I can’t go an hour without having massive cravings. Anyone have advice on where to start? I just have no idea, I’ve tried exercise and other hobbies but the most I’ve gone is 8 hours and it was complete and utter hell, to say the least. I just want to be able to live my life without needing something so filthy. But it just seemed so impossible, especially since as it is I have an addictive personality.

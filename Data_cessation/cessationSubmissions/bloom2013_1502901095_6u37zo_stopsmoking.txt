14 years, 2 packs a day, 4th serious attempt at quitting

Wish me luck... I'm motivated, but having to reset my badge was a bit discouraging, I'm not going to lie. It would have been 430 days had I been successful last time. In any case, this has to be it. I've learnt a great deal from previous quits.

10 days first time quitter - a few reflections

Hey guys, I just hit 10 days and *right now* I haven't struggled at all. I just want to share a couple of tips.       
       
1. Stay busy - don't let your mind wander to cigarettes        
        
2. Lots of mints, chewing gum and little snacks. Beat cravings with letting your mouth do something else        
        
3. First week or so, try to stay away from other smokers          
          
4. Quit with someone else, and don't let them down            
          
5. Frequently think about the damage it was doing to your body and how much better you'll feel       
         
6. Get rid of all your smoking stuff. Avoid reminders as much as you can.        
          
7. I haven't craved a cigarette in a couple of days now. If you can do a week, you've got this naaaiiiiled.        
         
Good luck lads

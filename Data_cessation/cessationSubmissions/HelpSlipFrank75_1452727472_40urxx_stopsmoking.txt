I want to be a smoker again, but I don't want to smoke.

I am currently on day 134 of my latest quit attempt. I have been having some very strange sorts of cravings lately. I do not want to smoke a cigarette, at least that's not what I seem to directly want. I want instead to BE a smoker again: I want to say "I need a f**king cigarette" and put everything down when I'm having a stressful day, I want to invite people to continue a conversation outside while we light up, I want to take a break like the rest of the smokers at work, etc. If I smoke I will feel sick, I will hate the smell on my fingers and I will regret losing these 130+ days. I feel like I want to be a smoker again, but I do not want to smoke. Has anyone else felt like this?

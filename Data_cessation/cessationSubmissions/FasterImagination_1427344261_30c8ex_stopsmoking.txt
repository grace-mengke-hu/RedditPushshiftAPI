So, i decided like 7 hours ago that i will stop smoking...

I know that it will be hard, been smoking since i was 13 (iÂ´m 22) i know 9 years is not that much to some, but i used to smoke a pack a day, sometimes even more, and i just can't take it any more, i told myself that it's now or never, my body is not the same, i cant run more than a few seconds without feeling tired and breathing heavily, but its been 7 hours or so, and i'm just dying, i know that i can make it, but my mind just get lost sometimes, there are so many things i am used to do and smoke that i just unconsciously look for a cigarette, do you guys have any tips to avoid getting to smoke ( i know that i might feel bad the first days, but any ways to just avoid smoking??)

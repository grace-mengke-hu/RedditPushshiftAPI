Instantly lost all cigarette cravings

Some context guys : Used to be a social smoker( a few cigs weekly). Developed mild addiction and used to get cravings daily. Sometimes I controlled. Many times I gave in. Started coughing black and brown phlegm and getting anxious due to that so tried permanently stopping a few times. Every time, the cravings were strong as hell. This time, and it's been two days, I am not getting ANY cravings. I have lost ALL urge to smoke. How is this possible?

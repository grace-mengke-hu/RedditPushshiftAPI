This is day 1 for me

I am 23 years old, and I have been smoking since I was 18. Over time I have said I was going to quit over and over, and every time I could only last a couple days a the most. Sometimes I would even only go half a day.

I have been really sick over the last 2 or 3 days and yet I kept smoking anyway. I am tired of being this addicted to smoking that I can't even stop when I feel like shit. I am really worried that I am just going to relapse tomorrow morning like always.

I don't know what I can do to make it last this time. My girlfriend has wanted me to quit forever now and it hasn't been enough to stop me, and I know the health risks and don't even care that much. I think I need motivation or something; but I don't know what to turn to in order to stop for good.

About 10 minutes ago I destroyed a pack I bought last night, and all of my lighters, but any advice or motivation to help me keep off this stuff will help immensely.

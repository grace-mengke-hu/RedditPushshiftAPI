Day 16 - Feeling a bit ill

Anyone else also feeling a little bit under the weather after quitting? Breathing is painful. Lot's of sneezing and coughing. I have less energy.

I am slowly getting better, but with ups and downs. Overall I feel like this is just part of the healing process, but I am really looking forward to my lungs being cleared up and for breathing to go easy again.

How long did this take for you, if you have come to this point already?

By the way, I will just keep on going, no matter what. This illness is just a test, and I am going to pass it with flying colors. I am not complaining, just describing what I am experiencing and looking for a positive and realistic perspective.

All the best on your own mission to quit, keep on trying, you will do fine!

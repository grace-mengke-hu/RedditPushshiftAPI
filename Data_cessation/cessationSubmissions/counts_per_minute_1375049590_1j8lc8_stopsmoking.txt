I was a hopeless smoker, and by fate I finally found my reason to stop smoking [13 days so far]

I'm currently 24 and started smoking socially at 18. When I joined the military at 19 my habit kicked up to a pack a day, by the time I got out I was at 1.5 packs a day. The military left me with some severe anxiety that persists to this day, so my smoking has been out of control.
 
I went to the doctor to get tested for a nasty insect bite from camping, and he asked me if I wanted any other tests. I remembered my dad kept telling me to get an Alpha-1 Antitrypsin test so I added it (My uncle died at 40 from the deficiency combined with smoking).
 
All my other blood test results were great, but I discovered I did have an AAT deficiency (80 mg/dL where 100 is bottom of normal). I immediately threw all my cigs away and haven't smoked since. Unfortunately, due to my poor mental health condition I still use nicotine gum and am switching to vaping. I am still very proud I could stop smoking; I never thought I would ever have the will power.
 
 
 **TL;DR: Found out smoking would kill me before 40, I wasn't ready to quit, but even less ready to die that young.**

[EDIT] I am ramping down nicotine slowly, there's no way I could go cold turkey. I plan on continuing to vape, just without nicotine.

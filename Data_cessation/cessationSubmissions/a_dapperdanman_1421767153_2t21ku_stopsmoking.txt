Today is my quit date.

I already feel incredibly anxious. I have been prescribed Wellbutrin, I heard it can take a few weeks before I have any desirable effects. So far it just makes me feel spacey and a bit irritable. Anyway, this is my 4th attempt at quitting. I always relapse when drinking, is there any suggestions one might be able to pass on that would possibly make it easier to still go out for a drink and feel the strong urge to smoke.

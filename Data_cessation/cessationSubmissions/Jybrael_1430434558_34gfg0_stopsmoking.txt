I am done! Day One!

Alright..so I have been smoking for the past ten years..it hasn't affected my health so much but I have been trying to quit. I have in the past managed to quit for short periods of time..(2 days :-P) then it all came back I couldn't stop..I had to get a smoke..and I ended up smoking..so this time I have decided I am done. I am going to quit. So I will be here..if uhm..you know I start feeling weak...and am about to grab a smoke..so please help motivate me keep me away..I need to make a lot of changes to my life..especially after this heartwrenching breakup..that I have gone through..and its still painful. :-(

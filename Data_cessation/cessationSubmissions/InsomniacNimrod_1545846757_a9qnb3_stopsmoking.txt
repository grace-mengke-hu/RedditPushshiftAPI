I refused a cigarette for the first time today.

I had a relative over today and he wanted to go out and roam around for a while. When we were out, he wanted to smoke and offered me one. I just said no. and it felt good! I have tried to quit multiple times and failed. Although I had reduced the number of cigarettes drastically, I wanted to get rid of this habit altogether. I haven't got any app to keep track of my time but I haven't smoked a cigarette since my birthday, the 16th of December! So, refusing to smoke today felt very empowering and good! I hope I can keep it up!

I think I'm ready.

It's going to be hard. I've smoked for almost three tears, and tried quitting more times than I can count, or even remember. But I've finally got to the point where I am done wasting money, smoking half a pack or a pack a day. Standing outside when it's freezing cold for a cigarette. 

I'm already a depressed and anxious individual and I hate that they make me more depressed and anxious. I hate coming inside to people telling me I wreak of smoke. To having to hide my smoking at work or school. It's getting in the way of my running and working out. 

I want to be the best I can be. I'm sick of seeing my teeth stained and getting yellow. Relying on that cigarette, being unable to focus, wanting to go outside when I'm with my friends or family. 

I want to quit so bad. 

It's going to be hard living with a smoker and having 65% of my friend group being smokers. Any tips on quitting while living with a smoker would be nice, thanks. 

Any tips in general would be nice, really. 

Goodbye sick feeling. Goodbye wheezing lungs. I'm ready to do this!

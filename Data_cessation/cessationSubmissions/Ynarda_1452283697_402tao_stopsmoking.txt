Do you ever have doubts?

**DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU ARE EASILY PERSUADED**

I am close to checking the 72 hours mark. This was the 3rd day in a row I didn't put a cigarette in my mouth.

The thing is that I am starting to doubt the whole quitting thing. I know that my reasons may sound childish but I have to tell them to someone.

Why can't we smoke? Smoking is one of our few pleasures. My few pleasures. My life sucks most of the time. We all have our problems, with money, with jobs, with relationships. Smoking is our time alone with ourselves. It's the 7 minutes of joy we have. The joy nobody can take from us because it's ours and only we can understand it.

Sure it's expensive. And sure it's unhealthy, but life is short anyway. Why not enjoy this guilty pleasure while we live it? I can't even go in a bar now. I feel it's pointless. The best thing when going to a bar is sitting at a table smoking and drinking. You can't do that in someone's house anymore, so the bar it's the only place. I don't even like walks now. I like to walk in the park enjoying the view with a cigarette in my hand.

I feel like I am breaking up with my best friend who has been with me for the past 5 years. Whenever I felt sad or happy he was right there, making me look cool or dramatic, or making me tell myself that it's gonna be all right in the end.

Let's be clear. I don't intend to smoke in the near future but to be honest I have a hard time imagining myself as a NONSMOKER. I know this sounds like a cliche but I am gonna say this to smoking now hoping that it will never happen:

"I will tell you all about it when I see you again..."

I slipped

After quitting for a while, the semester started, and I went back to school, and with it came all the relationship stress that got me started in the first place.

I hate it. I hate smoking, it tastes disgusting to me now, and every puff makes me hate myself even more, then I remember all the stress and the bullshit and I reach for a cigarette. I'm hurting myself, and it's all because of one person. 

Stress smokers, how did you deal with it? I need all the advice I can get.

Side effects of Nicotine vs. Side effects of everything else in cigarettes?

Ive done a lot of research on the side effects of smoking, we've all heard all the bad things (smell, blood pressure, lung health, decreased libido, loss of sense of taste/smell, premature aging, etc. etc.), but which are these are the side effects of nicotine addiction vs. the other chemicals in cigarettes. Just wandering, as someone who's using NRT (patch), if I should still expect all the benefits of quitting. Obviously the patch doesnt stink like a cigarette. But some are less obviously. Such as the blood pressure increase and decreased libido. Is the nicotine or the smoking the casue of this?

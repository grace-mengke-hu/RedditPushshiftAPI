Can’t seem to STAY quit

Does anyone have any tips for staying quit? I’ve tried quitting around 15 times now. I usually make it anywhere between 2 weeks - 2 months. I start feeling good but then start missing the habit, so I smoke. I know when I pick up that 1 that I’m picking up the habit again too.  

The last time I quit was he first time I felt like I was gaining something by quitting, rather than losing something. I’m starting again today. Day 1. Please say some prayers.

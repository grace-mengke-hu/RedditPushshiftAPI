Things that made me happy on day 1

- Cleaning the loose tobacco out of my handbag.
- Hoovering my room and getting rid of all the dust to help my lungs recover.
- My pulse rate, oxygen levels and carbon monoxide levels are the same as a non smoker.
- Tasting my raspberry vape again.
- Clearing the ash and tobacco out of my car.
- Throwing all of my smoking supplies away (!!!)
- Washing the smokey smell out of my clothes.

I'm also looking forward to having a bath later, getting the smell of smoke out my hair and doing my nails. 

YES YES YES I'M GOING TO BE BEAUTIFUL &amp; HEALTHY

Does it count if I only took a drag?

This year, my resolution was to quit smoking. Up until last night, I haven't touched a single cigarette. At a friend's birthday, I had a moment of weakness and took a drag from said friend's cigarette. 
Does it count as breaking my resolution if I only took a puff? I have no desire to smoke but it feels like I cheated.

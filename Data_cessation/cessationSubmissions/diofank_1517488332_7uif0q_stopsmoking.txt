Just a little tip on how to get over cravings

It's the second time I'm attempting to quit during this winter (and who knows how many times I've thought of quitting before) and this time I'm feeling more confident than ever! Going cold turkey, I have barely had any cravings, and I've found a great way to tackle the one-or-two-times-a-day desire to "reward myself with a ciggie". 

**Incense.** It works for me in so many ways:

- I get to light something

- I get to reward myself with a smell

- I can actually enjoy the smell because it's not the terrible stench of a cigarette and my sense of smell is returning

- zero nicotine

- not inhaling any smoke directly into my lungs

- incense is ridiculously cheap


Hope this trick helps someone, just wanted to share it with you because I'm happy about the non-smoker me who can enjoy different scents again!

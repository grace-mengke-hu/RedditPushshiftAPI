Did anyone quit because of anxiety?

This is my first day of not smoking and I am anxiety free already. usually after a rollie, I would have anxiety in my chest/heart, not just emotional anxiety, but I could physically feel it, you know? havent had that feeling at all today and I feel so much better, makes me feel bulletproof. Smoking creates or adds anxiety, if you have that, quit today and feel so much better. Good luck to you all

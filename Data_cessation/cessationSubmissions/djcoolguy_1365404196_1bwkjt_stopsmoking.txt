When you say you've smoking, does that include party-smoking?

I've been trying to quit smoking for a while now, on and off. I always keep it up, untill i'm attending a party, i really love those "drunk-cigarettes." The next day i feel like i already jumped in the trap, an then i start smoking again? - Any advice?

12days Muzufukaaaaaaa 😫

Damn, I can’t believe I made it till today...after 4 times trying this year...I never were conscious that I was addicted to smoking, In the beginning i smoked 1 from time to time , my Bestie is a smoker and every time she comes to visit me, we had that ritual, 1 movie , 1 cigarette...then after I begun smoking even without her , I finished 10/day after 1 year( still hard to talk about it coz damn that was good) , then I moved to Europe and the price were way higher than in my country...so I smoked like 1 to 2 cigarettes per day to be “economic”. But then I still found it too expensive, and my boyfriend advised me buy a Pack  of Tabac because it’s cheaper, I even watched a tutorial on YouTube to learn how to roll it!... I did it for a month I think, I found myself soooo pathetic... struggling with the paper and the filter...
Then 13 days ago, I woke up at 00am because I wanted one so bad, I rolled one, my boyfriend was sleeping, and since smoking is forbidden in the house, i had to get out , alone, in the dark, it was cold , and raining just for smoking... 😫 Plus when I smoked it, it was so disgusting, i threw up and coughed a lot, maybe I mad it too strong or whatever but I just didn’t wanted to do it anymore...so after 4 years of smoking, I finally made it to do not smoke for 12days. And I swear it’s like the best thing I’ve ever achieved.

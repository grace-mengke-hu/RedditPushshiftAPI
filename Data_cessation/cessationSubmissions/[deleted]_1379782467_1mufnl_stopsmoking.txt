I finished a pack last night, and I don't wanna buy anymore... I'm kindof scared to not smoke.

I'm scared because if I smoke, my anxiety is bad. If I don't smoke it's through the roof.

I'm scared because I have horrible depression, and not having that nicotine "friend" is going to add to my intense loneliness.

I'm scared because I'm worried I can't do it, can't quit. And when I start again I'll hate myself even more.

Even though I'm scared, I'm done. Done. I want to feel alive, and be able to breathe. To exercise and not feel like I'm dying. I don't want being a smoker to add to the laundry list of why no one will date me. I want to wake up and take a deep breath and stretch and feel refreshed, rather than cranky for a craving. I might start again, but damnit, I don't want to. I'm pissed off at myself for ever starting, and I'm pissed off for never truly quitting.

It's been 16 hours. I feel a craving. I'm not going to listen to it today, goddamnit. 16 hours so far. Only 16 hours. I'm going to turn that 16 hours into into **16 years**.

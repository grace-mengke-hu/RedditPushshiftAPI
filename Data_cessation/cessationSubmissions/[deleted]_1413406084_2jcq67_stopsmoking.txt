I was doing well, but...... I'm a bit of a hypochondriac

I live and work in Akron Ohio for one of the biggest employers in summit county and in light of this new Ebola diagnosis I caved. I'm very sorry I'll update my flair but this shit is real to me. I'll get back on the train tomorrow but for now I'm drinking and had a cigarette. I hate having anxiety.

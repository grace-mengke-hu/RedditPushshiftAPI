It's costing me over a dollar per cigarette - Australia

Asthmatic and it's costing me over a $1 per smoke. This shit has got to go. I cant see that there's a FAQ or any standard advice in the sidebar, am I missing something? Is there a newbie thread here I can read? Thanks and good luck to you all.

30 days today.

The past 30 days have been difficult. 

I've been happy, sad, calm, irritable...rinse and repeat. It's been a real roller-coaster. (And I can't forget that 4 out of these 30 days were in Vegas, a place that seemed designed by Satan to make me want to smoke). 

How did I do stay quit? It's hard to describe in list form, but here are some things that helped me:

 - Gum. So. Much. Gum. (I try to stick with Trident, because I think it's less harmful to the teeth, although that could just be brainwashing). 
 - Breathing. When a really bad urge comes, I focus on my breathing (as best as I can) until it passes. IT ALWAYS PASSES - even if it comes back 200 times in one day, I can still breathe my way through each one. And in doing so, I learn to get comfortable with discomfort. 
 - Expressing feelings honestly. This might sound like a weird or esoteric one, but one of the best things about this sub (for me) was that I could come here, express all of the strange feelings that come with quitting, and get feedback from people who identify with those feelings. That's it. Nothing complicated, just simple communication and identification. Hearing, "Yeah, me too" is what saved my ass on more than one occasion. 
 - Talking to my wife about how tough this is. And talking with her about how good it has been, too. 

Other than the above, it's just about wanting to be quit (for me). 

I made some mistakes on this sub. Got too self-righteous and too angry. I learned a lesson from it that I hope to carry with me moving forward. 

But I didn't smoke. I haven't smoked for 30 days as of today. I'm not going to smoke. 

Thank you to everyone who posts here, even if we've never actually communicated - or even if we exchanged hostile words. Knowing that there are people out there who did this before me, and stayed quit, makes all the difference. And knowing that there are people who just decided to quit today is inspiring.

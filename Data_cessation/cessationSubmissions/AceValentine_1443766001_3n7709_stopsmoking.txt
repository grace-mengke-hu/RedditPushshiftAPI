How well does Chantix work for quitting?

I was thinking of asking my doctor about the drug Chantix when I go to my appointment next week. I have had 2 people I know say that this drug helped them to quit, but I never see it mentioned in this sub.  I understand cold turkey is the best, but i seriously am my own worst enemy when it comes to smoking.

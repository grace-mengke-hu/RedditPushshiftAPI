trying again!! this time i actually want it!

i just turned 29 and i always wanted to be a nonsmoker by the time i got to 30. i've been smoking for 12 years and i've tried to quit 100 times but never made it more than a day or two. last night i had a girls wine sleepover night with my friend and she and i always smoke while we drink. i took the pack of cigs with me with about 10 left and have been smoking them all day. i've got 2 left and i'm going to smoke them tonight and start a fresh new life (hopefully) tomorrow. it's kind of like a goodbye party tonight.

i feel that this time quitting might be different. i actually want this more now than i have before. i'm a busy girl but so many things i want to pursue are pushed aside because i have to isolate myself to smoke. my family and boyfriend hate my smoking so i only do it when they aren't around, which causes me to actually create more time away from them so i can smoke freely. it's awful, and i'm tired of it. 

i'm scared but i'm excited. i have anxiety already and i know some of it is caused by what smoking does to my body. i'm dreading that anxiety ramping up because of withdrawal but i'm trying desperately to see that silver lining time when i can feel healthy again.

i know this is a rambly diary entry-like post but i just wanted to share it with people i knew would understand. wish me luck!

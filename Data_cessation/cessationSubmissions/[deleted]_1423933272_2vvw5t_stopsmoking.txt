Still coughing, wondering if it's harder on me because I smoked menthols for 27 years? (gross details in text)

So I was coughing like there was no tomorrow last night.  My spittle was sticky, like glue or very dense sugar.  I ended up coughing so much I threw up, after throwing up the coughing subsided and I felt much better.  Is it possible I am throwing up mucus or Fiberglas or whatever the hell is in menthols?

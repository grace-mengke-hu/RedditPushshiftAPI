Today starts my journey!

Hello all! I've been a lurker on Reddit for a long time now, but have decided to make an account today, and what better first post to make than to tell you all that this is the first day of my new journey!

I finished a pack of cigarettes last night, and whilst I was having the last one, I suddenly started thinking about WHY I smoke, how I started smoking, how stupid it is to smoke, etc. So I stopped smoking halfway through my last cigarette, threw it, and decided that today is the day!

I've dusted off an old vape that I brought last time I tried quitting last year, and brought some juice for it and a new coil this morning to help try and wean myself off of the cancer sticks once and for all! 

I have a feeling that I am going to be visiting this sub a lot in the coming days/ weeks/ months, so any support would be very welcome!

A quick question for anyone that uses a vape - what level of nicotine do you use? I want to completely take myself off of nicotine, but I feel that I have maybe bitten off more than I can chew and have only brought a 3mg nicotine bottle. Is this enough? Previously, I'd smoke between 10-15 cigarettes a day.

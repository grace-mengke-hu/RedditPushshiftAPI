Quit Smoking Around Other Smokers?

So I really want to quit smoking ciggies and I'm already a day in. I've tried in the past and got far but cracked. I blame it on the people around me who smoke making it hard for me, even though i know thats not right. Anyway I'd like to hear other peoples stories and advice on how they quit smoking, and how to deal with loved ones who continue to smoke. My whole family smokes and so do basically all my friends.

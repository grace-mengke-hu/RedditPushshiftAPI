Quitting for E Cig

So I've smoked for a solid three years now. I want to quit now. I was at 15 a day at one point, have cut my way down to 5. Tomorrow, I'm buying an e-cigarrette. Is this a good way to quit, slowly weaning away from the nicotine and quitting after a few days of that? At least I won't be clogging my lungs and arteries with that sh*t anymore, right?

Edit: Going cold turkey, starting from last night. Don't have an ecig yet, but if after ten-twenty minutes of cravings I need to buy something, I'll get that.

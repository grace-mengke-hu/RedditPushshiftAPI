Is quitting possible for everyone?

After almost 5 years of (pack a day) smoking, I made a vow last night to stop.  Picked last night to quit about three weeks ago.  Every day that passed during those weeks, I felt stronger and more motivated to quit.  Last night, I was on top of the world!.... 

Today is a different story.  I am looking for any reason/rationalization to have just one cigarette.  I came across a butt from the weekend in my backyard, and attempted to take light drags from it.  This is ridiculous, nothing makes sense, all I want is that sweet, sweet burn...

So is quitting possible for everyone?  Could it be that someone cannot give up an addiction without losing it, mentally? (Ok, I admit that sounds crazy)

I am currently sitting at my desk at work where a good amount of my coworkers smoke... I would greatly appreciate any motivational words and links to keep me rejecting those damn burning sticks.  Thank you.

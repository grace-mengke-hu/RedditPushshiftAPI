21 days strong. Time to quit another smokable.

I just joined reddit and this subreddit is the first thing I started following and reading. 21 days ago I stopped smoking. I'm 23 and am not a heavy smoker but would smoke often with friends and on weekends. I play hockey and soccer and live a rather healthy life style and what broke me to quit was not only that I hated being out of breath playing sports because I'm so competitive. But because I am lucky to have a girlfriend that gets really emotional when she sees me smoke. She told me she doesn't want me to die anytime soon and that there's nothing good from it. And well here I am today. She gave me that little push I needed. But all is not well still. I quit smoking cigarettes and yesterday I quit smoking weed. I would smoke weed at night time or before hockey but not a pothead in my opinion. I felt smoking weed made it easy to not smoke cigarettes. I've read so much about you awesome quitters dealing with mood swings and I realized although my mood as got better. It's not where it should be. I get angry easy and am proud knowing I'm not going to be smoking anything down the long run. Time to stop pretending I'm not a smoker cause I don't smoke cigarettes. I've been cheating with joints and that's about to stop. For anyone else that quit smoking but still smokes other things. Time to step back and realize we have the power to stop bad habits. First step. Realizing what our bad habits are. Thank you for reading. Please comment and keep the support within us going. Cheers from Toronto.

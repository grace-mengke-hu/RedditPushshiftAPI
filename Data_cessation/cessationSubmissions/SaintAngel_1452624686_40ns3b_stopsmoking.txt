One day short of two weeks.

I am an addict. 

Im currently in the throws of kicking this nicotine addiction i spent ten years developing. Ten years; one decade of my life I spent smoking. 

Its actually, really, very, truly difficult; I wouldnt wish this feeling on my enemy. Today I am 13 days without a cigarette. Which means, physically I am free of the chemical dependency. I should be in the clear, right? I shouldnt be having a ‘danger day,’ a day where relapse is a risk. 

The physical effects on my body are not the issue today, its the mental dependency. Its my mind dealing with a tough situation and its learned behavior when dealing with stress is to take 5 minutes and smoke it out. 

I cant do that now, and the trigger goes off, the response is a desire to smoke. Desire is unmet, which causes more stress, and it becomes a loop. Im trying to fight, not only a chemical addition, but a learned behavior. 

Day 13 isnt an easy day, tomorrow might be harder, or could be easier. i wont know until I make it to day 14. Day 15 could be a cake walk, but i’ll only figure that out once i get there.

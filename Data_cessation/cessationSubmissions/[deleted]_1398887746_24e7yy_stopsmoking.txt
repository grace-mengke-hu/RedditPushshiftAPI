Severe cravings after an injury?

I sprained my ankle really *really* bad yesterday. I haven't stopped wanting a cigarette since I first felt the pain. It's becoming too much to bear. My grandma used to smoke and she quit for a very long time but when she broke her ankle she took it up again. I wondered if this is a 'thing' that happens or just coincidence. Am I going to feel like this with every major injury for the rest of my life? I feel like I'm going crazy.

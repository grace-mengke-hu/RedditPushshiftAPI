One week today after 33 + years

I’m vaping with 6 ml so I feel like I am cheating but I have never gone this long without a real cigarette. 

I have been lurking on and off a while and all of you are very inspirational and it helps immensely when I have a craving to read your posts. :) ( cravings are def way less)
I’m going to jump ship soon and get off the vape too. I feel amazing!

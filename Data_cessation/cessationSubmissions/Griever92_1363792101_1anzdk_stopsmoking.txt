It's been 78 days...

Things have been going pretty well since I embarked on this journey during the advent of 2013, I seemingly felt like I've had no cravings since week 1 (maybe 2), been able to stand around friends and colleagues who still smoke.

But I came to a realization.  I hadn't noticed it really until yesterday, but I seem to have replaced smoking with chewing my fingers into oblivion.  I don't know why i'm doing it, I assume it's likely some subconscious oral fixation that you always hear about on crime shows while the super cop is deciphering the suspects' actions.

Is this what my cravings have become?  Have I just replaced them with this subconscious need to chew off my fingernails?

Anyone else run into this? My fingers hurt. I need to stop, but I don't usually realize i'm actually doing it until it's too late.

(Aside from this, the non-smoking thing is going great)

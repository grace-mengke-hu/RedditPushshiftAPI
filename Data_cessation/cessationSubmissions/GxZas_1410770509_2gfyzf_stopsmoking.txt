Considering ditching the patch after one week after reading Carr's book. Thoughts?

Last Monday I started using the patch after 15 years of smoking (including 2 or 3 of e-smoking). I haven't got a cigarette since, apart from a few herbal cigs - they were just a waste of breath, but I kept hoping they'll give me some satisfaction. About 2 or 3 days in I started reading Allen Carr's "EasyWay" and I finished it last night. It got me thinking that maybe I should skip 10 weeks of light struggle and just quit nicotine all together.

I'm fairly certain I can go 10 weeks on a patch, but I'm not having the best of times. 
With Carr's cold turkey method I would be free of physical symptoms after about 3 weeks, but I'm worried it might be to hard - especially since this is the first time I'm seriously quitting nicotine (and I really want it to be the last).

Any thoughts will be welcome.

EDIT:
Thanks for responses! I'll probably be drinking this Friday, so I'll hold off ditching the patch till Sunday. And then I'll try to go on without any replacements, but I'll have a patch handy just in case.

I really want to quit smoking... Tips and advice please?

I would really like to quit smoking. I quit on New Years, but we all know how that goes. I only made it four days. All of my friends smoke so it is a tough environment. I will start fresh tomorrow and just remove myself from the problem. It's mainly difficult in school because all of my friends smoke. I just would like it if someone could give me some motivation, advice, or tips so I can reflect on them when I'm feeling that crave. I've only smoked for about 3 months now, but I want to kick the habit now. I feel like an idiot, I told myself I would never smoke when I was younger. I saw the damage cigarettes do, yet I still picked up that first cigarette. Help me...

How do I stay motivated?

I've been smoking for 14 years, I'm 32. I've quit several times for a few days here and few days there. This past January I quit for 2 months, and then I began to suffer debilitating anxiety and I believed smoking was my only option. I began to take care of the anxiety and I feel strong enough to quit again. Anyway...it's been 12 days! What I would like advice on is how to get past the complacency? I start to get that "oh well I want to smoke so I will" feeling. I lose my motivation. Any one else? How did you combat that?

Sorry guys, I'm out.

Out and alive!!  I haven't check this subreddit in the longest time and I was just lurking Reddit and I decided to login to comment on something.  Upon login in, I've notice that I was following this subreddit and REALIZE that I don't need to asked for advice or support anymore because I CAN DO IT MYSELF without thinking about it.  I feel great and I recently started to exercise and I've already lost 17 LBs ( I weight 216 now). Best of all is that the money I've saved are going towards supplies, membership and better uses :D.  If you recently started to quit, DONT STOP.  It's all in your head and if you REALLY want to quit then you WILL quit.  

Don't be a loser to cigarettes.  If you think your strong then you will be stronger than it, it SHOULDN'T control your life.  GOOD LUCK!!

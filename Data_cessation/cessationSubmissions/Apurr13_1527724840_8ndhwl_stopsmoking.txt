Day 52 :) I feel like I really did it. Although today I find myself fantasizing about smoking all day.. just to kind of go back to my old life for 1 day..

Has anyone quit cold turkey and then started vaping? Do they have vaping with no nicotine at all, I just really miss hanging with my friends and drinking wine, they all smoke though but ai feel like if I could hit a vape it would help! Ideas?

Once more with feeling!

This might be the 4227 time i want to quit and latley i "tried" every day. But this doesn't really matter: i've made it to 4 month before last year and thats where i want to go to and redo my mistake.

I dont want to pay to die early and lower my live quality one cigarette at a time. 

See you in 1-3 days when the cravings kick in! Last time that was the point when i started reading Allen Carr again and it really helped.

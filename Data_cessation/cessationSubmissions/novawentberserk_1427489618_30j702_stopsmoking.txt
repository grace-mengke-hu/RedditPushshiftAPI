Cheating?

I've been nine days cold turkey for the third time in a month. The last two days have been hell. I know that I'm no longer addicted to nicotine, but the mind games have always been worse. Plus, my husband is a smoker and I'm a stay at home; so all day everyday there's a pack of cigarettes in this house just sitting there eating at my willpower. It's become torturous, no matter how positive I try to keep my attitude. 

I really, really felt like I was going to cave today. And I can't do that again. So I went out an bought a fresh vaporizer (no chance of residual nicotine) and 0mg juice. I'm hoping to only use it when I really get triggered, and to keep me from cigarettes/nicotine, but I almost feel like I'm cheating somehow because it does give me an 'ahhh' feeling of relaxation and relief of tension. 

Thoughts?

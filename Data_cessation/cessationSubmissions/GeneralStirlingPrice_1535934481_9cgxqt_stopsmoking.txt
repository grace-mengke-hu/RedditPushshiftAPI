Day 23

Today’s mission on my smoke free app is to visit an online community and share with at least three people what has worked for me. So, I hope this reaches three people. 

I am going to be completely honest. I smoked about 10 cigarettes last weekend between Friday afternoon and Saturday morning. I was away with adults, I was drinking and I wanted to feel like I was not restricted. I spent every moment of every cigarette either apologizing or feeling guilty and once the cigarette was finished, the “itch” was still there. I wasn’t satisfied by smoking. I logged those cigarettes in my app, but chose to continue with my original quit date, rather than reset it to that date. Take that as you will. 

So, what’s working for me? Holding out through the rough times. Using the app to watch my success. Realizing that having that cigarette doesn’t fix anything. I don’t think I can pinpoint one thing that is specific to my success, but a combination of a lot of little things. It was really hard at the beginning. I’m a 20 year smoker, it’s my normal. But it’s getting SO MUCH easier! And it is so worth it. 

If you are considering quitting, I encourage you to take the plunge. If you’re struggling, please do everything you can to push through, it will get better!!! You are a badass and you have what it takes to kick this filthy habit!!!

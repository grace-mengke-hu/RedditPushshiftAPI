"I'm definitely not having a cigarette today, no problem" = trouble

Every time I've thought those words, I've ended up smoking within an hour or so. It seems whenever I feel like a day will be easy, it definitely isn't. Part of me thinks it's my addict brain trying to let me lower my guard so it can get the nicotine it wants. 

Anyway, just thought I'd share. "This is going to suck, but you gotta get through it" seems to work way better than "everything is cool, you can coast through this"

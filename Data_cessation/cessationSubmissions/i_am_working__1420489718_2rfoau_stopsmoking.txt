I once stopped for three months (February- April 2014). Second attempt now.

I quit using Alan Carr's Easyway(thanks to /r/TheDoctorsCompanion for suggesting this book in an askreddit thread) but started again because I lost my job and had nothing to do with myself.
After that I read that book many times but it never worked.
I am going cold turkey from now. Hope this subreddit helps. I will keep posting updates.

Quit smoking update

Well hear I am. Well and truly 1 year into my quit and I can honestly say it might be once a month the thought of smoking even crosses my mind. That's despite living with 3 smokers and still continuing to drink. One very interesting thing I have noticed is just how much cigerettes stink. When I quit smoking weed I always enjoyed the smell but with tobbaco the smell isn't just bad it is repulsive. I honestly dread to think I once smelt like that and I now know that all those times covering up the smell from my parents probably wasn't doing anything haha. I want to wish everyone hear good luck and if anyone wants to talk about quitting I am happy to help the best I can.

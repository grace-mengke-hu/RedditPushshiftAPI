3 days in.. Now it's Friday and the weekend's here.

I've been going strong for a little over 80 hours now. I've been doing great - exercising, drinking water, BREATHING. Now the weekend is upon me. I'll get off from work soon. I usually look forward to that end of the week cigarette as I walk home from the train. I'm also moving and going to a concert this weekend. I feel like I'm doomed to fail. Advice??

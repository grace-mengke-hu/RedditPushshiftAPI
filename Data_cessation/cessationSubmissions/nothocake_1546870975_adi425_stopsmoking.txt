6 year anniversary yesterday

Everything is different.  EVERYTHING.  It took me too long to quit smoking and it was keeping me from being who I actually am.  

I'm actually damn sporty and into moving my body, breathing hard, sweating, taking on all kinds of physical challenges, striving for new personal bests.  Smoking wasn't "me" at all, but I was terribly addicted.  Smoking stole from me the joy I got from hiking, running, riding bikes, all things physical.  For 20+ years.  That's really sad.

I'm feeling great, today, though.  

You can do it.  Stay the hell away from cigs.  They're keeping you from joy.

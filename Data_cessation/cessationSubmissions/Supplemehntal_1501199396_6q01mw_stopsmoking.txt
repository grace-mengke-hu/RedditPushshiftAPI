I want to quit, just not bad enough.

I'm 20 years old, I've been smoking half a pack a day for almost a year now, and black and milds pretty frequently for about a year before that. I want to quit. Part of me really does. But part of me doesn't. I enjoy smoking. It calms me down (I have pretty bad depression and anxiety). I have an e-cig, and sometimes I'll go days without smoking and stay strictly with the vape. But then something stressful will happen and every part of me just says fuck it and I'm right back where I started. One thing that keeps pushing me over the edge lately is a bad breakup from about 4 months ago that I can't stop thinking about. Originally I was just going to try to quit when I got over it but I honestly don't know when that's gonna be.

Any advice?

Lack of focus/disassociated

In the last month Ive cut back from being a pack or more of full flavors a day to one cigarette and my 3mg vape. This afternoon Ive been a space case and zoning out and almost feeling stoned and im totally sober. I used nicotine at first to increase my focus in school and it became an addiction. Now that I'm taking in significantly less nicotine I feel like im in a dream. Any of you have this feeling?

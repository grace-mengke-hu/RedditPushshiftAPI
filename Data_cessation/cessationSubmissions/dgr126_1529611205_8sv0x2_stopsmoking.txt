Community can you please help me

I've been smoking for 10 years, not cigarettes, but black and milds and they are worse than cigarettes from what I hear. I just want to stop. I learned about myself that if I can by pass the urge after 10 minutes or so it leaves. I know I have to want it for myself and do it for myself. Just would be nice to hear some encouraging words. I ran out of cigars today, maybe this can be the day. Scratch that, just remembered I bought some on my way back from lunch break lol. Sorry for typos.

On day 2 of no chewing toothpicks.

I've been off the smokes for a little over 5 months now, and have a new hurdle to overcome: toothpicks.

I started chewing on toothpicks as a replacement for smoking while driving, working at my desk, having drinks with friends, etc.

At first I didn't mind it at all because it was such an obvious step up from cigarettes, but now I'm over it. There are little pieces of toothpick all over my house and car, and I'm sick of accumulating these little wood piles every time I go to the bar.

So time to stop! It was my last little line of defense against nervous energy, and now I will have to develop new, hopefully less gross and obvious coping mechanisms. Wish me luck!

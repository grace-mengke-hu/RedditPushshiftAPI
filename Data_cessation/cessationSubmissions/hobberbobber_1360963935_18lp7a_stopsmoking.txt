2 freaking weeks baby!!

This is the longest I have quit in over 6 years.  I am feeling awesome and doing great and controlling the cravings.  

This post is just to sort of pat myself on the back, because I am feeling freaking awesome today.  2 weeks, hell yeah!!

Thank you to r/stopsmoking.  I have been reading daily, not posting a ton, just kind of lurking.  But just reading other peoples stories and struggles helps me with mine.

We can do this.  It is getting better everyday!!

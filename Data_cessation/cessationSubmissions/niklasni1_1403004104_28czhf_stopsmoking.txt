Going to see my parents tonight, looking forward to actually being there and not just waiting to be able to leave to have a cigarette

I smoked from 15 until recently (so that's almost 15 years, with a few breaks, once for more than two years), but I never liked smoking in front of my parents. When I was living with them I'd just go for a walk, sometimes for hours. Since moving out, they live fairly close to where I do, so I visit fairly often but never for more than five-six hours, and most of the time when I couldn't make up some excuse to leave for a few minutes, I'd just sit through it and feel atrocious by the end, couldn't wait to leave and walk around that first corner so I could light up. In fact, one of the reasons I'd never stay longer was that I knew I'd need a cigarette -- picking the addiction over time with my own parents. Well done yeah...

Tonight, I'm going for the first time since I quit this time around. Can't wait to just sit in the garden with them and my girlfriend and just be present, instead of thinking about when I can get my next nicotine fix.

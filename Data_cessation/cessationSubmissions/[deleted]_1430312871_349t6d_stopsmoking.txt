The one thought holding me back, the one thing Allen Carr says that I can't believe. Please help me if you can.

Hello everyone. I'm hoping that you guys can help me out here. I'm pretty committed to the "EasyWay" approach, since it got me off smoking for two years straight. After a recent failure, I realized what had gone wrong. I had it in my mind that if things got really bad, say a family member died, at least I could turn back to cigarettes for a while. It was a form of moping and "just one pack" thinking. 

However, I'm afraid that I'll continue moping now that I'm quitting again. Because there's one thing Carr says that I can't believe. It's this: "Cigarettes give you no genuine pleasure." Hell, I remember how good it felt the first time I ever had one. I know how good it feels to have one after two years, that first one, anyway, and it's not because of nicotine withdraw. Now I admit now that for smoking most of my pleasure comes from relieving withdraw. 

However, the way that Carr has it set up is that before we smoke, we're at (let's say) "0". And then withdraw takes you down to "-1", until you trick yourself into thinking smoking feels good when you relieve that withdraw and go back to "0". But I know that having that first cigarette takes you up to "1", even if you go down to "-1" afterwards. Now maybe usually you can't get up to even ".5" or something, but it does seem to me that nicotine does feel good sometimes. Can anyone prove me wrong? And if so, can you explain why the first pack feels so good? 

I would love to be proved wrong. Thanks!

I understand that this sub covers all forms of nicotine addiction but I think it would be nice for stopvaping to become active

Not talking down on vaping but this would be nice for giving advice to people getting off vapes. For me transitioning from smoke to vape was easy but quitting vaping was very difficult. I think it would be a very beneficial community.

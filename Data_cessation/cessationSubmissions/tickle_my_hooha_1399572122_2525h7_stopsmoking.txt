Slipped up at 98 days, but it's only made me more determined

I'd quite cold turkey for 98 days when last Sunday I was at a party, had been drinking, and got to talking about some pretty emotional stuff. I couldn't help it - I had a cigarette. I'm not excusing what I did, but I don't regret it either.

Immediately, I was concerned that I would be straight back to my old ways.. but it wasn't the case. I've impressed myself because, even though I no longer had the 'streak' behind me, I didn't want to have another one, and I haven't. It makes me confident because I'm not quitting to watch the numbers go up, now. I don't smoke because I don't want to.

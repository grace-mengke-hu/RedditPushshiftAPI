How do I support my husband while he quits smoking?

Hey guys! My husband gave up smoking as of yesterday, while it’s only been a couple of days I’m super proud of him. He says he’s been feeling super brain dead and tired from not smoking. What are some things I can do to help him? He wants to do it cold turkey but know he’s having a hard time with it.

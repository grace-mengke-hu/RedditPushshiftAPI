Had my last smoke on Monday, afraid I might relapse today drinking with everyone

So I quit cold turkey this Monday. But my friends and I are getting together for a drinking session tonight, and am seriously afraid I might have one. Before my last cig, I was doing one/two cigs a day max for a couple months. 

How do I stop myself after I am buzzed/drunk ?

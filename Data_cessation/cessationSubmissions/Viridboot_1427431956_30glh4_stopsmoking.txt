Just came here, bought a pack...

I read through a few threads right before I bought a pack. Started smoking a cig, kept thinking about it. Halfway through I stopped and threw it away. Thanks for the posts everyone, really. I can't tell myself I will start tomorrow, I want to start now. Two steps forward, one step back. Day 1 here I come...

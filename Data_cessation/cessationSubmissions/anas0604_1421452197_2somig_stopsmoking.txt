Seriously... the cravings

Smoke free for 60 days. I've made it 2 months. The cravings yesterday and today are almost unbearable. I'm not even sure why. Work was stressful yesterday but it was better today and I'm still struggling to manage. I have been so motivated for the past 2 months and today all I can think about is smoking that dang cigarette. I know I won't relapse but this is going to drive me crazy. Thanks for listening!

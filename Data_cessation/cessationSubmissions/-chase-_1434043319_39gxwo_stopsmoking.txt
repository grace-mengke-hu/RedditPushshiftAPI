Just a little heads up. You can do it!

I just realised smoking is so far off my mind I do not even visit this subreddit on a regular basis anymore and my last cigarette is almost 400 days ago.
 
And I certainly was a heavy smoker. 20+ years and near the end I was at ~60 cigarettes a day.
 
I substituted that addiction with vaping, at first with nicotine but for months now completely without. I'm not saying this is the best or the only method, but it is the one that worked for me... and if I can stop smoking you certainly can too, find your method and go for it!

Any body feel like they have a cold?

It's been nearly a week since I stopped smoking. I have an odd amount of energy, my appetite is back... but my sinuses, oh god my sinuses. Its a fucking faucet, im blowing my nose constantly, sneezing all day and the drainage is pretty bad. This happen to anyone?

First day without a craving

Today is day 23 of no nicotine. I just realized now, at 10pm, that I didn’t have a craving all day. Finally a taste of freedom.

Things that have helped me:
1. Toothpicks (nearby and accessible, great to chew to bits)
2. Water (my go-to at the first inkling of a craving)
3. Walking (10mins to 1hr walks around my neighborhood really settle my mind)
4. Bodyweight exercises (pushups, situps, squats, lunges, yoga, punching a tree)
5. Perseverance (convincing myself that the “me” that I was when I decided to quit is more right than the “me” that thinks I should just cave and smoke, day after day after day)

I have yet to check out Joel Spitzer’s videos (thanks for the tip, Pokemon-drawing guy) or Allen Carr’s book.. but I plan on that as well.

I’m 30, smoked for 10 years with a few 1-4months “quits” attempted along the way. This is gonna be the last one.

Thank you everyone on here who posts, comments, and reads. This community really helps.

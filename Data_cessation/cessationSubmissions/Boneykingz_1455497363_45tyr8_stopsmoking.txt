Day 2 is over and I'm coping pretty well but...

Night time is a bitch! Last night I nodded off and woke up about 10 minutes later dripping with sweat and itchy all over my body. Tonight I nodded off and the same thing happened again but this time I'm just really fidgety and can't seem to nod off again. Day 3 tomorrow though so hopefully after tomorrow the withdrawal I'm feeling will subside or even go completely... 
Also am i supposed to update my badge myself? It's hasn't changed.

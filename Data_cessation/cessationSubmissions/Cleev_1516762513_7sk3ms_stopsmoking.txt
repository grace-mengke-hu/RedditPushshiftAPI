Didn't manage to quit, but I've cut back significantly.

Went from twenty years of smoking two packs a day to smoking three or four a day.  One on my morning commute, one at lunch break, one before bed, with an option of having one on the commute home.  I know it's not quite quitting, but it's a huge positive step in the right direction, and I'll get there eventually.

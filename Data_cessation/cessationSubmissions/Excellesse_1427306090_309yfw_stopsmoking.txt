Four days on the patch

Gotta carry on. I quit two days before starting a new job - I had planned on a 3-day cold turkey, but the reset time I had requested from my previous job started dwindling (coworkers birthday, boss would've had to work 16 hrs etc, so I changed my mind and decided not to quit. I'd just bought a pack, didn't have enough time, blah blah. The  Saturday morning I just went, well why not? I wrote a note for my roommate that included prerequisites for opening the pack I left her (I have to be crying, I have to ask, can't remember the third) and went out and bought a pack of patches instead. Wish me luck guys!

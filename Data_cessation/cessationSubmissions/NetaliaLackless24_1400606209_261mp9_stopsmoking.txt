Trouble sleeping

Day 8 here and while quitting is going smoothly, I've started having some serious issues getting to sleep. I don't want to jump right to attributing it to being off nicotine and I'm not going to start smoking again over it, but it's an affect I haven't heard of and I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced this. If you did, did it get better? How did you deal with it?


I'm hoping it will just get better as my body adjusts itself but I'm worried. I went to bed at midnight last night and couldn't sleep until 7AM, woke up at 8 to go to work. Other nights I just get 3/4 hours of sleep, but last night was the worst so far, although I'm still a recent quitter. 


Thanks ahead of time!

120 hours (5days) and feeling... OK

So 5 days. Day 3 was the worst as far as cravings go. All in all it's not been too bad at all except I'm having problems sleeping, I'm getting about 4-5 hours a night. I have a mouth full of ulcers and my lungs have started to hurt, I mean really ache...  my house smells and Im thinking I should just repaint the whole thing and wash everything.... other than that pretty happy and confident that I've got this cracked

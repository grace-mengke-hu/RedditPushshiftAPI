3 1/2 days smoke free. I feel on top of the World!

With the help of my girlfriend, a rock solid determination, an e-cig, and the Cessation Nation app... I'm 84 hours smoke free.  This is the best feeling in the World!  I can't describe how proud I am of myself, and how much I just want to keep pushing and see a week smoke free.. then a month, then three, then a year.  This is just the beginning, and I'm extremely excited about it.  Just wanted to share the good news and I hope your journey is going just as well if not better.

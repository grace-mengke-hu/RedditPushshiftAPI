7 days smoke free

I’m an 18 year old who’s been smoking since I was 12. Since I’m VA, the law is changing next month to be 21 to buy nicotine products, and I refuse to do the whole “if I give you money can you buy me a pack of cigs” and finding someone of age.🤔 So I bought Step 1 nicoderm patches and they’ve worked amazing! Haven’t even had craving and I plan to continue!

Kind of accidentally quit, what better time than now, right?

I didn't smoke at all yesterday or today because I've been a bit sick and every cigarette I had would just make my sore throat hurt so much more, so now I'm thinking: "Hey, I've gone almost 30 hours without one, why the fuck just not do it anymore and give quitting a go again?" And so I did!

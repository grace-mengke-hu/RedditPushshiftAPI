Smoke tastes disgusting but I still keep on doing it

Ok just a little background: I'm a smoker for 5 years. Compared to years ago, my consumption has lessened from 10-12 sticks a day to one. Sometimes I even skip especially when I'm with my bf. I still crave for it every single day though, like a moderate smoker would. Quitting may be something for another time. I'm trying.

I'm just wondering if there are/were any of you who despised the taste of cigarettes, whatever brand or flavor it may be, that you keep on spitting when you smoke, and yet you find it hard to quit? I'm that person. The first 1-2 puffs are the best, I dont spit on those yet. But say 7th puff and im already making a puddle on the street. Sometimes I even gag and throw up. I hate it because another part of my brain still loves the idea of smoking despite all that.

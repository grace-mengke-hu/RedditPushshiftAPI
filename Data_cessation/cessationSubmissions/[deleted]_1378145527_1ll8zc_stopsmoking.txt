Today day is the day. After 9 years, I started the process.

I feel like its the end of an era. I had my last cigarette last night, and boy did I enjoy it. Halfway through, I realized this was going to be my last cigarette, and it kinda freaked me out. Yet, I still have make it 15 hours without a cigarette, and without bumming one from someone at work or stopping at the store to buy a pack. 

I am using Welbutrin, chewing on straws to help with the hand to mouth habit, and got prescribed some xanax in case my anxiety spikes at work. I feel like I've really got this. Anybody got any advice?

Almost two month smoke free but can't get rid of terrible persistent cough. Similar stories? Any advise?

I quit smoking close to 2 months ago during a terrible case of bronchitis.  The bronchitis has been cleared up for well over a month now according to doctors, and yet a cough remains.  It's not like smokers cough, if anything it is even more annoying, a dry cough that comes on in fits a dozen or so times a day.

I have heard that sometimes there is coughing after quitting because the hair like things in lungs and air ways are growing back.  But this is really freaking annoying and disheartening!  This cough is literally worse than when I was smoking.  I often cough so hard it makes me gag, lots of fun to do in the middle of class. 

Has anyone else experience this kind of intense cough after quitting smoking?  If so how long did it last?  And is there anything else I can do for it besides just drink more water?

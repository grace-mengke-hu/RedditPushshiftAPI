Quitting (this time) has been scary easy ... waiting for the other shoe to drop.

It's been a week and the worst it got was an impulse that ranked about a 6-7 on a scale of 10 being the strongest, and it lasted about 2 seconds.  When I got out of work I had an impulse to light up and reward myself but I thought, "Damn, oh yeah, I quit ... oh well." It was as if I momentarily forgot, then remembered.  There was no question.  Last time I quit it would have been more like, "Oh shit I want one bad!  Dammit.  This sucks!  Will this ever end?!  Man, I could pull over and get a pack and no one would even know.  If I did start up, I could quit again next week ... besides I got that thing coming up; that will be too hard to not smoke then.  Shit.  Should I?!  It really only comes out to $200 a month, I can afford that.  I can't keep thinking about it, this is too distracting.  I'm not ready for this.  Fuck it. [minutes later] Pack of Newports please, in a box."  
When I first quit 20 some years ago I called that my week from hell.  The thing that motivated me to not smoke was simply to not have to relive that horrible week.  I fucking cried in traffic just being frustrated.  This time I've had a small handful of, "oh yeah, I forgot; I quit."  If I could understand this better and bottle it, I'd be handing it out by the crate.  
I'm irrationally terrified now that I put this out there, the gawds of irony and humiliation will make it really hard for me :-/
TL;DR absolute certainty in the heart and mind made quitting easy, doubt made it torture.

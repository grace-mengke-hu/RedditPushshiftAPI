Today is my 3rd 'Day 1' in the past year.

It's the first time i actually feel good about it ! The other times I was quitting for the wrong reasons (it was financial) and would bum cigarettes whenever I saw a friend smoking. I recently picked up running, I've been running a mile a day for the past two weeks and man am I out of shape ! I also tried champix a couple of month ago, that made me depressed and frustrated. Yesterday instead of going out to buy cigarettes I bought nicotine gum.

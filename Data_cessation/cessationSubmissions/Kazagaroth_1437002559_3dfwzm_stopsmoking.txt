Extremely Tired - Fatigued...anyone else?

Hey all, on day 6 (again), and this time I am experiencing this constant fatigued feeling.  First of all my sleep schedule is totally whacked out.  I'll go to bed around 8pm, wake up and midnight, and go back to sleep around 3am, wake up around 11am, go to work, and repeat the process.


All throughout the day I feel exhausted.  I love the feeling of having my lungs back, and being able to smell again (holy shit my farts...), but I was curious if anyone else has heard of or experienced a period of low energy immediately after quitting....

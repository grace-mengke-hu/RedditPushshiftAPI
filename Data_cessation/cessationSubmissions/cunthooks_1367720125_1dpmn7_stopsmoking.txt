A heart attack stopped me smoking

I smoked a pack a day for thirty years and loved it, until I had a heart attack. Doctors told me the attack was due to smoking and poor diet ( too much trans fats from pies ,cakes etc ). Apart from fixing up my diet  I quit smoking, cold turkey style, right there and then.
The first 2 weeks of quitting was the hardest and after that it was very easy reject tobacco. It has been 7 months now and I do not miss smoking at all, I can even be around people who are smoking and it does not bother me.
Now I breath a lot easier, I can smell the fresh air and food tastes a lot better.

Quitting After 10 years!

I am 30 and i have decided to quit smoking for good. In the last 10 years i have failed at quitting 4 times!

This is my 5th attempt and im just sick of having it in my life!!! 

I thought this group would keep me going and down the right track :) 

Its been almost a week smoke free!

Day One down, rest of forever to go...

I'm 20/f. Today was the 5 year mark of when I started smoking.
 
I don't exactly know why I'm posting; needed support from people who understand I suppose. I've got a great (non smoker) boyfriend and I'd really like to not worry if I smell or taste like smoke around him. It's been 5 years, I don't want to smoke forever. I don't really know what I'm expecting, all I know is I'm gonna try. Any advice for kicking the cravings? Any advice in general? 

This already frustrated girl would greatly appreciate it, best of luck to the other quitters and congrats to those who already have. <3

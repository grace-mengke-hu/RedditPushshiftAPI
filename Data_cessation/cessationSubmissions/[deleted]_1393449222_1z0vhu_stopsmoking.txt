[HOLY F***] switched to ecigs, it's been 48 hours, my lungs feel brand new and exercising feels "right" again

Unbelievable the immediate changes I have noticed. I have been using the Mistic ecig, it hits exactly like a regular cig.

Except now I know what I am ainhailing is just water vapor. It is not causing harm; I can feel my lungs healing. Taking deep breaths is euphoric. I just did some push ups because I had so many energy, pushed myself to 35 (usually stop at 20) and it felt great, didn't feel like I was going to die from trying to catch my breath.

For reference I have been smoking for about a year and a half. Highly recommend ecigs, this post is 100% true and not an ad, but mistic is the shit. got mine at walmart, starter pack is $15.

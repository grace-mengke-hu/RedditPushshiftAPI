5 year old girls logic stopped me from smoking!!

I was talking to this 5 year old girl while having a smoke. She asked me why I smoked, proceeded to tell her that I kind of started doing it while I was drinking which progressed into doing it all the time and it's hard to stop, she should never start it because it's a bad habit etc... 

**5 year old girl, "if it's so bad, then why don't you stop doing it?"**

Pretty bloody hard to argue with that logic. That was just clicking over in my mind until I realised that it is terrible for me and I should just stop. 20 days going strong.

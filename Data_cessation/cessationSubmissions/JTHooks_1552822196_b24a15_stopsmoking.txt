Body purging toxins at 3-4 months? (Or dark pee: is it detox or something else?)

So its been four months since I stopped smoking (after almost exactly 30 years). The first month was fine, the second I really wanted to smoke (and punch someone in the face) - but this third month I've had insane cravings and ... I cannot stay hydrated! No matter how much water, broth, Pedialyte, (sugar-free) Gatorade or coconut water I drink my pee is the color of a hangover. I've got a headache most of the time, I sweat easily and occasionally I smell bad no matter how much lady speed stick gets involved (and yes, I shower). I eat really well (always have) and nothing has changed to my diet and exercise routine (same routine for many years, even before I stopped smoking).

I figure if it does indeed go on another month or so (its been going on about a month or so already), I'll go see a doctor. For now I'd like to get an idea if other folks have this feeling / evidence of their body purging at a similar time in their stop-smoking journey. Thanks in advance for your thoughts and feedback.

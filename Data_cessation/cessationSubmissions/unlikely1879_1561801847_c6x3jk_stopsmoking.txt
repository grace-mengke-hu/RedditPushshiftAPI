Strange experience with quitting vaping

I quit vaping because I was sick of being a slave to my addiction of inhaling toxic shite in to my lungs. I quit for 3 days and the withdrawal was as bad as everyone says it is when they quit smoking. I gave in after day 3, started vaping again days 4-5, regretted my decision immensely and quit again day 6. It's not day 10 and for some reason the second time around has been SUBSTANTIALLY easier, no more difficult than kicking a sugar addiction. I find it strange because I'd always read that if you give in and relapse, you're back to square 1. This doesn't seem to be the case for me at all! With regards to smoking or vaping, do you guys have any experiences with quitting, giving up and then quitting again very quickly after?

Wow it has been this long?  
I have not been on here in a while. In all honestly i don't even think about smoking anymore, it is a past me. 

I just wanted to say, anyone can do this.  If you are looking for an excuse not to, there isn't one.  I can say, hand on heart, i FEEL better, my LIFE is better, EVERYTHING is better. 

Stop now, this second.  I promise you that your life will be better, its a long run but it WILL happen.

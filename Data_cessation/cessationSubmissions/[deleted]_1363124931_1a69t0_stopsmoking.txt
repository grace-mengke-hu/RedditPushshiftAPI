Electronic Cigarettes. Has anyone used these to help quit smoking or is cold turkey the way to go?

I quit once using lozenges. I'm about to quit again and was wondering if I could do the same using something like Blu (one drag to hit the nicotine pangs) as a cheaper substitute (lozenges are about 50 a box in NYC. Disposable Blus are 8 bucks). Thoughts or suggestions?

3rd time's a charm, hopefully.

I have been smoking for the better part of 15 years, accounting for stopping smoking for 1 year the first time and 6 years the second time.  Until five years ago, I smoked at least a pack a day.  After getting married, I cut it back to maybe 3 or 4 a day but slowly started smoking more and more until I was back to a half pack a day.  

Last weekend I got a horrible sinus infection, and smoking felt like I was burning my face off.  Saturday was my last smoke, and I just haven't felt like smoking then happened upon this sub while clicking the Random button.  I started reading a few stories, and decided to just make it official that I am going to try to quit for good this time.

I have tried everything in the past (Chantix, patches, gums, lozenges, e-cigs), and the only thing that has worked for me thus far is cold turkey and will power which is the method I am using this time.  Thanks for reading, best of luck to the rest of you quitters.

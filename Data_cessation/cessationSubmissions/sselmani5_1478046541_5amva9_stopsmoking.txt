Cravings (cant take it..)

I cannot stop thinking about cigarettes! 4 months deep smoke free and I went through all the withdrawals and the lung detox and all that (still get WD), but as we get to feel better we tend to become less grateful for the health we have! And that is when we start to think that it's all good to smoke again.

No matter how hard I remind myself of the hardships I went through these 4 months, I still can't stop thinking about smoking!

I am 26 and i started smoking since i was 14 or so.. so you can imagine that smoking has been a big part of my life.

I decided to quit for the third time after I got food poisoned so I had to cut back on smoking and drinking so my symptoms will get better after the food poisoning went away I figured this would be a good chance to quit cigarettes for good since I already beat some of the withdrawals with the food poisoning or so I thought so ðŸ˜Š

Sometimes I feel like something is missing in my pocket I like to have stuff in my pocket like my phone, lighter, wallet, pack, it kept me occupied whatever.. its just me! I tried replacing the lighter and the pack with bubble gum and Halls candy. But I can't chew bubblegum for too long because it makes my throat tired, I like that Halls vitamin C though.


Anyone with any tips or going through something similar it will be a big boost to my confidence and continuing my nicotine free life ðŸ˜ƒ

I was thinking of a alternative to smoking nicotine which is to start smoking weed. What  do you people think let me know please ðŸ˜€

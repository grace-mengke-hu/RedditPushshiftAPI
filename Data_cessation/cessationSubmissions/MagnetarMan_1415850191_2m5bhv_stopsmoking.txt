Clean bill of health

As of march 2014, I had smoked a pack a day for 17 years.  Three years ago, a cardiologist told me I was looking at blood pressure medication if I didn't change my ways.  I was 31 years old...  It took me a while, but I finally quit 8 months ago.  Today, the very same cardiologist told me I had a normal heart.

It feels so great to be normal!

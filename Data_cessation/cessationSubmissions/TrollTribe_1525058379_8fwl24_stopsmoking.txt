I broke

I feel awful

I was doing so well, 2 months of no smoking, a week without drinking, and a week of working out again

Yet here i am feeling sorry for myself at a bar after a few drinks and a cig 

I keep telling myself it's one time, but what a lame excuse.  I had an argument with a girl i actually saw a future with for the first time in my life i felt i could actually see myself settling down. 

Our two year relationship ended and i just feel like life has flipped head over heels 

I hate feeling like this. I was doing so well before....

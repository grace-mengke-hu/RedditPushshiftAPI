Recently quit and maybe I'm trying to make myself feel better but...

I've been told by several people that those who quit before the age of 25 have a very good chance of recovering nearly to the point that your body seems completely normal (as in never smoked). Is there any truth to this, or is it a statistic that people my age bring up to give them an excuse to smoke? Thanks in advance!

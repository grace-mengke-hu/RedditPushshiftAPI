I'm making it

This subreddit has helped me so much. I'm a little over 2 months nicotine free and I really couldn't feel any better about it. I no longer enjoy the smell of other people's cigarettes and I'm mostly able to drink without craving one too bad.

I can smell better and I can taste things better and I no longer have to worry about my clothes being smelly around my family. 

So if you're struggling with cravings, just remember to pop some gum in your mouth, or write the craving down, or breathe. You got this!

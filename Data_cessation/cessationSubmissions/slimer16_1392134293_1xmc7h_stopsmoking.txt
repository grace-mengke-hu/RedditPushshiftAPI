One Year Club

I finally hit one year of a smoke free life after smoking a pack and a half a day for almost 9 years.  If you told me a year ago I would be a non-smoker after so many failed attempts to quit, I would have given you a look like [this] (http://i.imgur.com/arcCaK2.gif) one.

I started off by reading Alan Carr's book that many of you here have suggested, and though it helped a little I was still smoking many weeks after reading it.  The only thing I think I got from it was that I knew if I could just go one day, one single day, without smoking then I know I can go another day.  For the first week though I decided to ease my way off of it a bit by smoking only e-cigs, and I believe that helped give me the strength and courage to attempt my first day completely smoke free.  Once I finished that first miserable day of a smoke free life I moved on to the next day, then the next day and kept at it until it got easier each day.  I won't lie though, those first two weeks were horrible and the cravings were still strong, but if you can go one day without smoking then why go back? Why not go two days? Why not a week?

It has now been one year of a smoke free life and I don't regret quitting for a second.  For the past 6 months I can honestly say I have not craved a single cigarette.  I really believe that if I can do it then anyone can as long as you do it for yourself first. Stay strong and [Fuck the zero] (http://i.imgur.com/zTc0MFR.jpg)

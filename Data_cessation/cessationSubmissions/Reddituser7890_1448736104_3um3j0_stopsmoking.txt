Smoking made my other addictions worse.

I'd like to start off by saying that today I've been smoke-free for four months and I finally am comfortable saying that I've beat it for good. What I've really noticed from quitting is that I've been able to start tackling my other bad habits/addictions as well. I have a very addictive personality and smoking cigarettes was by far my biggest weakness. It's almost as if I just don't crave the dopamine rushes any longer. I was constantly eating shit food, jerking off every night, and drinking a ton of caffeine in the form of multiple energy drinks a day. 

I had read that trying to quit all of your addictions and bad habits at the same time was a recipe for failure so I started with smoking being that it was the worst one and decided that I would tackle them one at a time after that. To my surprise, once I quit smoking, limiting everything else became almost effortless. I had more energy throughout the day so I didn't need as much caffeine which meant I could finally start falling asleep better at night and not needing to fap to make that happen. My snoring got better so I stopped waking up so much throughout the night which means I wake up better in the morning so I can make myself a healthy lunch to take to work. Quitting has made so many positive improvements in my life that I can't believe I let it control me for so long.

 I picked up the Easy Way To Stop Smoking on Amazon for about the price of two packs of smokes and it hooked me instantly. I quit after reading about half of it, finished the book them gave it to a friend and he quit too! I'm telling you, if I can do it, every single one of you can do it too.

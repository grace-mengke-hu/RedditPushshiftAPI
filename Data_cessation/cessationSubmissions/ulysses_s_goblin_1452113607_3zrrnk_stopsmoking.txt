I was really mean to my partner last night

I came home at the end of Day 4 yesterday in such a dark mood. I felt like I was PMSing but was also overcome with the desire for a cigarette. I was working on a project and drinking a french press, which didn't help because those two things typically go hand in hand with cigarettes for me. My partner kept doing sweet things to cheer me up, like pouring me another cup of coffee or putting the cats in the bedroom so they wouldn't bother me, but I just couldn't shake my foul mood. I realized how terrible I was being after I tried to pick a fight about... chicken stock. My partner looked at me with a raised eyebrow. I asked him what that look was for, and he very matter-of-factly  told me I was being really unpleasant to be around. It was then I realized how ridiculous I was being, and that I was acting this way because I was going through withdrawal. Even after I realized how absurd I was being, I couldn't get rid of this anger that was sitting on my chest. I never want to feel that way again just because I haven't had a cigarette in a few days. What kind of life is that? I am so lucky to be dating such a supportive man. I really owe him one for his patience and kindness.

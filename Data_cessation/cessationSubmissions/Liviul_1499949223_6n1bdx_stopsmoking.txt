Relapsed

After a couple of months without smoking,didn't count, I had a couple of relapses this week, I felt the need to share this because I belive that the feeling of shame would help me.Plus that I didn't bought the cigarrets , I asked a colague of mine from work so I'm promising myself and to the comunity that I won't do this anymore since I'm not buying them.

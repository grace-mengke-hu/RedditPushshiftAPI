In three days...

It'll be two months for me! Two months smoke free!!! I was watching tv a few moments ago and it hit me, I made it this far with no slip ups. Tears were in my eyes.

I was the girl that would have 5 smokes back to back with my coffee.. I went through a pack a day. Sometimes more on the weekends. I loved smoking. It was my first thought in the morning and throughout the day. I rolled my eyes at people that said oh quitting is easy. I wouldn't say it's easy but it's doable. I still crave but I never give in. 

If I can do it, you certainly can.

Tips for withdrawal

As the title states. I am trying to quit haven't done it yet tried last night but by this morning wasn't feeling so good and I caved as a result and fallen mostly back into my old ways just with less smoking but still smoking, so I was wondering what are some of the symptoms you faced and whats the best way to deal with them or how did you deal with them. I am going to try to quit again tonight I have the weekend to not do anything. I made a post yesterday about quitting and looking for advice which I got some great advice and some support I just need a bit more advice. There is one thing I will say from that post yesterday, I suffer from social anxiety so I don't have any friends so it's just me alone to do this. So unfortunately that advice to find support from friends is not an option for me. 

Also just curios is there a way to change your username I didn't think I want to do more than one post but now I feel like I want to be a bit more permanent on here in hopes I can quit and if I do help others quit as well

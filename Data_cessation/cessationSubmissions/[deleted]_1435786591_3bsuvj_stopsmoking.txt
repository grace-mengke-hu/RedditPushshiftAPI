One year smoke-free today!

I'd like to just offer encouragement and a little bit of advice to anyone who is starting to quit or is having a hard time. First, it is possible. It took me 20x or more of trying to quit before I finally did. It seemed like I was always trying to quit for a couple of years there. It finally worked.

And the piece of advice, which I know is not the popular quit program here, is that you should try using the gum if cold turkey isn't working. I couldn't have quit cold turkey. I wouldn't have been able to get through those first days without a little bit of nicotine. You don't really get addicted to the gum and it gets you through the tough cravings without negatively affecting your health. It's worth a shot if nothing else is working.

But I've saved over $1500 this year, feel great, breathe better, everything is great after a year of not smoking. I still get tempted sometimes but it's usually harder to say "No!" to food cravings (I'm dieting now) than it ever is to say "No!" to a cigarette thought. 

So I hope things go well with you at whatever stage your at. Best!

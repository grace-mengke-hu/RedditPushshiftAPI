Checking in at 5 months. Happy and going strong, but still a little disappointed.

The last time I quit, I made it to 8 months or so. I hit 5 months 4 days ago. I'm really happy that I'm down this path, with no intent of turning back, but perhaps I haven't yet realized the benefits.

Sometimes I enjoyed smoking because of the dreams I would have. I love dreaming, and nicotine gave me the most vivid, wildest dreams imaginable. My dreams would fuel my curiosity and passions. Now they are faded and worn.

The last time I quit smoking for this long, I felt amazing. I regained so much energy and I could smell the world. My body was strong. This time, I feel no different. Just as run-down. Just as lazy.

My lungs still hurt. I still cough up mucus.

There's no way I'll ever go back though. I have recovered some, but not as much as I expected. Not as much and not as fast as I did last time. I was really excited to feel the good feelings of quitting again, and I almost feel let down. Sometimes I'm afraid that there might be some less temporary damage involved this time.

As discouraging as this all sounds, I am still carrying on strongly. I'm not religious by any means, but the closest thing I can liken my quitting this time to is being born again. When I decided to really quit for good, it opened the world to me. I realized that I could experience life and the world around me in ways I never was able to before. Not only was smoking a physical drain, but an emotional one as well. The combination of physical and emotional drainage was inhibiting my life in a severe way. 

With out the addiction binding me, I can do so much more. It's just slower than I expected this time.

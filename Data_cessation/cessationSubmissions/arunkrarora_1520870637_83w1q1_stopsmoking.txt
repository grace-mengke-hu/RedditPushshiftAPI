You know what???

I was to have my first round of beers first time after I quit after four days. I was really really afraid as to how will I survive. But thank a God, I did not miss smoking inspite of having three pinta of my favourite beer. On a normal day I would have smoked six sticks. I am just loving my frame of mind...

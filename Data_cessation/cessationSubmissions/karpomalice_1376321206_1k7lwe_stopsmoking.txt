So, I quit 2 days ago

I'm 25. I've smoked for 5 years, ~pack/day. I know that's nothing compared to most smokers, but....I feel as though I had a deeper connection with smoking than just the addiction/habit. Someone put it well on here: smoking was a *part* of me; I believe that smoking shaped my personality and everything I enjoyed in life. 

Here's my dilemma: I don't feel as though smoking was *ruining* my life. I'm sure that's because I had only smoked for 5 years, and was in good shape before I started smoking, and decent shape while I was smoking. 

The reasons I quit: I just can't afford it anymore. And I was really fed up with *needing* a cigarette. I couldn't enjoy being stuck in a place for hours on end and not being able to smoke. I **hated** that part of myself. I hated that I couldn't go shopping with my girlfriend, or go watch a baseball game without NEEDING a cigarette. It was like my medication, and I viewed that as pathetic. 

I think this is going to make it harder for me to quit; the fact that I almost don't feel as though smoking was ruining my life. And I think that, in all honesty, if cigarettes were $4/pack I wouldn't have quit. I really wish I could try and get myself to keep smoking, just smoke like 5/day or something along those lines. 

Any advice for me on how I can tell myself that quitting IS the best thing for me? 

This blows. I've given up the one thing I fucking look forward to everyday on my way to work, during my lunch break at work, and on my way home after work.

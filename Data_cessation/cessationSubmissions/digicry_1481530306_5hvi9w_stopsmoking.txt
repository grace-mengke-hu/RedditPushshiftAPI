The Circle/Company Triggers

I tried my best to quit. Maximum was a month. I do good if I don't see any cigarettes around but the place I work, almost everybody smokes. At one point or other I end up being in that circle and just take a drag. It's like whenever I see them, my brain thinks about how good it feels to smoke in that circle. But, after smoking one, I regret and feel guilty about it the entire day.

Any suggestions to not let these triggers arise?

Planning to quit on Valentines Day, because I love my lungs

I'm 25 and I've been smoking daily and pretty heavily for 9 years. I think about quitting every single day, but I don't last more than 24 hours. I just give in to the little voice in my head. I've read Allen Carr, looked at countless websites, but I just keep doing it. I'll go out and buy a pack and a lighter and cave in. It's like my mind decides for itself and I'm just a passenger. Every day when I smoke I tell myself I'll try again tomorrow...

I've not tried setting a date before, but I've been building myself up to 14/2 for a few weeks. I thought it'd be a nice time - a little 'I love you' to my body, which I should have been doing for 9 years. I am very scared that I keep smoking past that date though, and that I won't have another serious attempt to quit for a long time. I really want to do this right. I don't want to keep smoking. I want to see what my peak physical fitness could be, and how much extra cash I'll have, and generally if life is better as a non-smoker.

Any advice for the build up to next week, anything I can prepare myself with now?

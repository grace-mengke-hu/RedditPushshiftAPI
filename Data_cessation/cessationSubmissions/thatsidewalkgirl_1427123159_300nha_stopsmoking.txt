I know first-hand how hard it is to quit, and it's ruining my motivation!

I want to quit.  I don't want to be a smoker.  It's ridiculous how strong of a hold this stupid habit has on me!

I have quit several times previously.  Usually, I can only make it about a week.  The longest I went was 3 months, and that was after I had went through Swine Flu and experienced the terrible respiratory infection that followed.

Now I just can't get the motivation to quit anymore.  Every time I think about it I think about what a hard process it is to go through.  It's hard to be around my friends that still smoke, it's hard to resist the urge to buy more, hard to resist the urge to "just have one".  I have a hard time replacing it with something else, like exercise, because I stay so incredibly busy and most of my smoking is done in the car while I'm driving.

I know all the benefits, I know what I have to lose by not quitting, but NOTHING will motivate me anymore because all I can think about is exactly how hard it's going to be to stick to it.

Any advice for this?

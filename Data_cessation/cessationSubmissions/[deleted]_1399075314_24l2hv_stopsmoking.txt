Just stopped the other day, need some advice!

I had my last cigarette on the 29th after just over 5 years of smoking 20 a day. I have to be honest, my cravings were only so bad on the first and second day, I'm feeling quite okay in that department.


My biggest problem though is my routine. I've gotten so used to my cigarettes breaking up and my day and the hand to mouth action that comes with it. Without that space filled, life seems very miserable indeed.


Have any of you fellow Redditers had this same problem? If so how did you combat it? Any advice would be much appreciated!

I wish to quit smoking but not because I dont like it.

Ok, what do I mean by that.

I've been a smoker for about 3 years now and I'm still in my early 20s. Now, I like smoking. I know it's the addiction talking and that it's a bad habit (we all know the rhetoric). However, I wish to quit because I literally feel as if I'm dying inside. I get chest pains every morning at the top of my lungs not allowing me to take a full breath without discomfort and I also have to live with a constantly congested throat. 

I need some advice, if not how to quit smoking, then to at least address the issues I mentioned. Any help is appreciated. 

Thanks in advance everyone, hope you're having a good day.


PS. Not a heavy smoker, 3-5 a day - Don't have a morning smoke. Also, I am asthmatic.

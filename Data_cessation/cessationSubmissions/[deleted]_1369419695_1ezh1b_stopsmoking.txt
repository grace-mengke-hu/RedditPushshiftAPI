2 days in and feeling great

I've smoked for many years, I had my first taste as a young kid in England, and I always was intrigued by the smell of my Dads Benson & Hedges. Lately though Ive gotten tired of being out of breath from climbing one set of stairs. I want to be able to work out without feeling as though Im going to have a heart attack. I'd tried the cigarette sized ecigs in the past and they couldnt do it for me. 

This time, I took the plunge and got an [eVic](http://www.vapeitnow.com/pics/joyetech-starter-kit/joyetech-evic-5.jpg) and some menthol toothpicks. So far so good, the menthol vapor from the evic tastes great and when I feel like getting an oral/finger fix, I pop in a menthol toothpick. I havent smoked in 2 days, I havent craved, I feel like I can breathe normally and I feel like this time, I'll not go back.

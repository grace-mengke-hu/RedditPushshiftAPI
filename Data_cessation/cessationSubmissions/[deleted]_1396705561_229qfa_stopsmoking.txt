Question on lung capacity (also rant...ish)

Hello /r/stopsmoking, 

first time here but I do have a quick question, I  smoke marlboro reds (2-3 packs a day for 11 years now) but my lungs never get "out of breath" when exercising and such. I can still hold my breath for about 3 minutes. I didn't see anything on the sidebar about lung function or capacity so I'm just curious to how others deal with smoking and lung function (actually breathing issues) 

I have been trying to quit smoking as I was also a very heavy drinker (bare minimum a fifth of vodka a night for 10 years, my liver is fine weird I know) but I am trying to kick the habit of my last addiction of smoking. I can go the weekend without smoking when I run out of smokes on Friday night and is too lazy to go buy some more during the weekend but as stated previously all in all I average 2-3 packs a day. Any recommendations would be appreciated.

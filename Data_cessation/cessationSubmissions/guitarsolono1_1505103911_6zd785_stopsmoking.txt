Back at square one.

I am a long-time lurker and smoker who is starting over tonight. I have quit before using Allen Carr's book and just re-read it today. I had three months clean this spring before I left university and took an annoying job near home. After a few frustrating weeks of work, I slowly slid back into the trap and have been getting my head right to stop smoking again. Re-reading the book is my ritual for quitting and I always savored the "Last Cigarette" chapter before butting out. This time, however, I realized that I already had the tools I need to stop and just needed to quit being an idiot. This is my first-ever post and it is an attempt to be accountable to someone besides myself. So thanks to all of you, and let's do this.

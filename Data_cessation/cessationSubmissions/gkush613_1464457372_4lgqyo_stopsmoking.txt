day 3 cold turkey

day 3 cold turkey for me  .. have had cravings but nothing i couldnt control and on-top of that i had a whole bottle of wine to myself without smoking (SHOCKER!)  still feels like a dream in the sense that i haven't broke  yet and picked up a cigarette! this absolutely feels amazing :)

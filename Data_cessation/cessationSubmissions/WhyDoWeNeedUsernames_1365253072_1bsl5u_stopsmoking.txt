Cravings

I got them from time to time. All the time. When I am drunk, when I am sober, when I am happy, when I am sad, when I do sports, when I chill out, when I am around smokers and when I am not.
3 to 5 times a week, sometimes more often.

But I don't care. Looking forward to my first anniversary. Thumbs up to all of you.

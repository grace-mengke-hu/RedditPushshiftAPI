Really long day

10am to 1230 am yesterday, 10am to 135am today. I am struggling. I know I dont need it. I know even if I have it its going to taste like dog shit. I promised someone special that I would quit. I am probably not going to have one. But writing this out is making it a tiny bit easier. Stay strong. You dont need this bull shit. Neither do I.

1 WEEK!

I'm very excited to be 7 days free of nicotine. I smoked around a pack a day for the last 18 years. My pregnant girlfriend and I quit at the same time, and it feels great to be non-smokers. I check this sub every few hours and it helps me to see my flair. I love how supportive this community is. I hope everyone joins me in not smoking today

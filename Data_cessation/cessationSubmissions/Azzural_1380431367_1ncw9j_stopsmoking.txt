What did you do to beat the cravings?

I just stopped smoking yesterday and am having a hard time right now. My head is spinning, I can’t concentrate, and my lungs feel tight.  Luckily with my job I am unable to smoke for the next 7 hours, but how did you push through this feeling? I know it’s possible but I can’t think of anything else but having a cigarette.

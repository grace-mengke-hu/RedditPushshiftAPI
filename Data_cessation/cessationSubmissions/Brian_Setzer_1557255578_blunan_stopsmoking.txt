How to not feel anxiety about the damage that has already been done?

Hello all, so I keep quitting and relapsing, saying to myself "the damage has already been done". And I must say, this is causing a lot of anxiety to me since I'm really starting to feel the negative effects of smoking nowadays.

Did this happen to you and if so, how did you get over it? Thanks in advance.

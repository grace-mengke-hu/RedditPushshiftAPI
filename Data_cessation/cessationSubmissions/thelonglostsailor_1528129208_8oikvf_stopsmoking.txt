I have mono. Silver lining!

Been feeling terrible for almost two weeks now. After throwing up violently three times at work on Saturday, they ran a blood test and it turns out I have mono. Smoking was especially harsh, my fatigue was making it completely not worth it to get up for a smoke. It's now been three days and I think any sort of withdrawal symptom is being masked by the mono sapping all of my energy away.
I'm hoping to keep it this way even after I recover. I haven't had a drink in two weeks either, and I feel that was a major contribution to not wanting to smoke either.
Now if I could just get an appetite back, that would be great. :(

90 Days Woohoo!! You can all do it !!

Finally , having quit for 3 months I feel my mind and body are over the difficult times you go through when you first quit! I totally did this... feeling proud after kicking this nasty 25+ year addiction!  New quitters never give up.. The first few weeks can be rough at times I even found the first couple months quite difficult at times but power through..honestly you will come to a day when you feel great and you know you have done the best thing you can for you and your health !! I know I will never smoke again ..I also know I may get random cravings from that Nicotine asshole but I am ready!!! You can all do this . All the best to this sub..not one puff ever :))

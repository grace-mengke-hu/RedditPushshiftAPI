Nearly half a year into life after smoking! I have a gross question....

I have never really asked anyone this before because it is gross but I need to understand it! 

I have never really experienced the brown/green gobby crap that smokers often spit up. Instead, it feels like I just have a trail of mucus like crap running down the back of my throat over by tonsils where I swallow it. At first this meant I didnt cough up crap and it was less disgusting, but now it feels like an obstructionish patch in my throat because its obviously sticky and slimy and I can feel it when I swallow. 

It also means when I have a runny nose cold the mucus heads in a flowing river down my throat and I spend the whole day sniffing and swallowing it all... Im gross (amazing how vile smoking was eh?).

So anyway, weird question but is this normal? Will it go away over time further from my quit date? And is there a way to cough up this stuff rather than swallow it, better out than in right? 

Sorry for the gross question. Happy quitting guys! :)

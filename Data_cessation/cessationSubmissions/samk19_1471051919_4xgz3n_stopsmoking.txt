I want to quit but I don't think I have the willpower.

I want to quit so bad. I have frequent chest pains, I'm coughing and clearing my throat all the time, my teeth are yellow, and I just want to be healthy. I've tried nicotine gum, it didn't work. I've tried nicotine patches, if anything they made me smoke more. Yes, I was smoking while on the patch, yes I know you're not supposed to. I recently was prescribed Wellbutrin because my doctor thinks it will help me quit. The pharmacist said to wait about two weeks and then quit. Its been about a week. I've thought about chantix or Zyban too, but my doctor said that Wellbutrin is basically Zyban. I'm so addicted to cigarettes. I smoke over a pack a day. I feel like I constantly have a cigarette in my hand. I even smoke at work even though I'm not supposed to. I don't know how I'm going to be able to stop. But I want to so bad. Should I try using the nicotine patch while being on the Wellbutrin? I feel like even that won't work. I've been wanting to try that monq therapeutic air but I don't have enough money to try it yet. I just don't know how you all do it. It must take so much strength, strength that I don't feel like I have. Any tips would be great.

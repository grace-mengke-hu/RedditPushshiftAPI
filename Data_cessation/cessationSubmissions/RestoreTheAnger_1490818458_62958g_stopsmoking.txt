A Decade.

I just realized it the other day. 10 whole years. Almost every year I've said that by next year I wouldn't be smoking anymore. And yet here I am ten years and $18000 dollars later. No more. I will not let ten turn into twenty. I'm 26 hours into not smoking and I'm more motivated to stop than I've ever been. This time I will succeed.

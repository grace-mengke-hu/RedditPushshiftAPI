Quitted smoking years ago, but still have smokers' breath

I used to smoke a lot, but the last cigarette I touched was years ago, but my wife still notices that my breath smells like smoke when exhaling from the nose and she's close to me. Can anyone relate? Can anyone recommend any treatment, etc.? I haven't been to the doctor, yet.

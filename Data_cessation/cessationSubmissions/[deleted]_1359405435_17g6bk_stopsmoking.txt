One week today

So this is the first time I've ever attempted to quit in 17 years and I've made it one week without a smoke. I keep reading / hearing about people starting up again after several months of not smoking. After all the withdrawals and mental battles / challenges that comes with the first week or so, I don't understand why anyone would start up again? Do people think they can just smoke one cigarette and get away with it. Any insight on what causes people to relapse after so long? I know there is a lot variables that can cause this but to me it seems like the longer you go without a smoke, the easier it gets.

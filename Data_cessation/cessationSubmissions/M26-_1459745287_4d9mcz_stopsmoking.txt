It would have been 3 months tomorrow if I didn't put a cig in my mouth tonight.

Hi people,

I've been a lurker on reddit for quiet some time and just discovered this sub by doing some searching.

I don't know if I am writing this for myself or for another more subtile reason but anyway... 

Long story short: I am 25, started smoking at 18. I've stopped before, multiple times, usually for months and usually cold turkey. Three months ago I stopped, once again. I have an alcoholic mother who came back to my place yesterday. The whole situation stressed me out (not trying to take it as an excuse, I just fucked up, but I am putting some context.) she's a smoker too, sneaky me took one of her cigaret and smoked it an hour ago. Felt "good" at the moment, I now feel shitty and nauseous. She'll probably stay here and make this house a smoker house again (it's officialy hers, I guess I won't really have my word in it), I am afraid I won't be able to control my urges now that there will be tobacco in the house 24/24 and that I put nicotine back into my system.

I have a problem with supporting comments

It's my third smoke-free day, I feel anxious yet pretty determined. The only thing that has been bothering me is how I feel about positive comments like "good for you!", "way to go", "you got this" etc. I just can't stand hearing them and I can't have a sincere conversation because of this. People just say that I'm a little grumpy today because I quit. It makes me feel like shit that I can't be nice to these people who are trying to boost my morale.

On the other hand one of my smoker friends told me today that I would eventually relapse anyway and join him in smoke breaks which you might think would be demoralizing. But no, among all those comments, the negative ones are the ones boosting my confidence. Whenever I hear a sarcastic "sure you wont start smoking again" with a stupid grin on someone's face, I think "I will show all those smug shitheads that I can quit." 

Did anybody else have this kind of experience? How did you deal with it?

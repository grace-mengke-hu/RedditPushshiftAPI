For a while I was jealous of smokers and non smokers

After I quit almost three years ago I had some bad jealousy.

I was jealous of people who continued to smoked.

I tried to mentally remind myself logically that smoking was nasty and bad for me...but emotionally I wanted one sooo bad!

On the other hand I was jealous of non-smokers because it seemed so easy for them.  I was especially jealous of the people who quit smoking cold Turkey without any hitches.

Thankfully I used a couple of meditative techniques to take the edge off.

Has anyone felt feelings of jealousy from our nasty addiction?

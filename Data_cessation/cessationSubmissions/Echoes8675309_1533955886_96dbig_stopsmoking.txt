Made it 16 hours... please tell me how you succeeded

I just finished reading Easyway to quit smoking and thought I was ready to quit. By the next morning I had woken up in a good mood and ended up sleeping again and re woke up in a terrible mood, crying and ready to give up. I took the Friday off to get a head start and quit for the weekend before I had to go back to work. I was a flurry off emotions when I re woke and told my bf I wanted a smoke ( who has quit in the last year) and he told me to have one, and I did.

I started crying, went outside and had one. I'm horribly scared that I'm going to be stuck here for the rest of my life. I'm 24, been smoking for 9 years, and I want it to be over. My bf wants me to vape so atleast I vape instead of smoking so atleast I have something to fight it but after reading the book, it tells me not too.

I'm really interested in learning how other people have quit, even if it's different from the book. I don't have the health or money too and I want to be done but my emotions get the best of me. If someone has any advice, please tell me.

I can do better, and I will do better. I just want to escape this trap to a healthier life. Please help me. 

Thank you all

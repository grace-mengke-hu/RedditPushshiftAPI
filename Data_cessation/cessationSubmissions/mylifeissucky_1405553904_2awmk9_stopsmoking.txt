Saw some big old butts on the ground today but never even touched them.

Unlike what I would  have done a few days before, I didn't think of actually smoking any and just thought "If only I was smoking still, it would've looked useful". Oftentimes now, I put my foot over them and massage the toe over them into the ground until all the tobacco is loose and blowing away in the breeze.

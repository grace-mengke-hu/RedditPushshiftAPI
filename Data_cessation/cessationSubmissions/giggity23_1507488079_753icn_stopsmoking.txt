Do I ever miss it? Not really. I was drinking wine yesterday and got a little tipsy. While being tipsy would be a major trigger to light one up a year ago, I hardly felt any urge. Progress has been made and its very noticable. For all the newbies and people who fail time after time out there. Its. Fucking. Worth. It. I also quitted weed on the same day and it was the best decision I ever made. I smashed two addictions at once. Did I ever think I would have gotten this far? I did not but I felt stronger with every resisted temptation. So be strong and kick this habits ass guys and girls, you will thank yourself later. Peace out and go kick some ass!

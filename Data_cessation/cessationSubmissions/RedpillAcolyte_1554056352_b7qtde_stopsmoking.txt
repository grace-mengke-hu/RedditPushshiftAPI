Replacing Secondary Benefits of Smoking?

Sharing this in the hopes that someone here can empathize with what I’m saying and has advice to offer - 

I’m 22 and recently started smoking again after 12 months cigarette-free. I found that mini cigars (Black and Milds, for instance) don’t smell as bad and burn longer, and over the past 3 weeks have gotten to the point of smoking 3-4 of them per day.

Oddly, I’ve found the most enticing benefits of smoking to not be the nicotine rush....I’ve suffered from acne since my teenage years, and smoking has proven to be the only effective treatment, as it dries out my skin more effectively than any cream or medication. My appetite is suppressed, so I lose weight and look better. I also socialize more and feel more “desire” to go out with people at night and be a social human....it’s very strange, but for some reason when I’m smoking regularly my mind state changes. Time works differently, and I feel like the world slows down and I’m actually “living” as opposed to burning weeks away on “auto-pilot” mode at work. I can hold a conversation and, now that I think about it, the only times I’ve had successful relationships with women have been as a smoker, as I’m more easy-going and unburdened by the stress which piles up on me when I lose that release.

These secondary benefits have been the most difficult for me to shake, as I know as soon as I quit smoking again I’ll go back to being a nervous, acne-riden guy who doesn’t have any interest in leaving the house and blinks away months of time. I get to the point where I’m willing to accept the serious health consequences of being a smoker, because I feel that it improves the quality of my day-to-day life in a drastic way.

Has anyone experienced this, or have a logical explanation? Any advice to offer for how you’ve replaced the secondary benefits of smoking in your life?

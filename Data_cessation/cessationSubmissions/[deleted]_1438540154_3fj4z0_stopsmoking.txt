I fucked up :(

So I started vaping at the end of 2015.
 
I started with 18 mg for the first few months and worked my way down to 12 mg, then 6 mg and then last month I have been switching between 6 and 0mg nicotine. 

Last week I was almost out of something to vape on, so I orded some 100ml 75/25 vg/pg with 0mg nicotine. 

Well it havent arrived yet and the craving to just smoke something was too big. And I knew I had a 18 MG laying around.. So I vaped it.. that feeling of nicotine.. is not horrible.. but good :/

 ahhrg.. Must not vape more.

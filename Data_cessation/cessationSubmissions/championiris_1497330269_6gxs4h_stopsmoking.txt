My boyfriend quit smoking

It's been about a week and a half. He's had one cigarette so far that I know of. I've been through quitting alcohol and weed so I sort of know what he's going though. However, I've never been addicted to cigarettes so I don't really know what he's really dealing with. 

I'm just looking for advice on what people need when they're quitting. He's going cold turkey and I want to be supportive and do whatever I can to make this easier for him. 

If I could just get a few dos and don'ts, I would greatly appreciate it! Thanks!

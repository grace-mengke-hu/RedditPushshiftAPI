Why do I ever CARE?!

I've been out of this sub for a few months because I was carrying with my life, being a non smoker. But man, I've been trigger by everything lately! Seeing people smoke, Finding an old lighter, Watching Movies with smoking in it, Resting after food...
the logic behind it is "Why can they and I can't?" or "But..but I learned it's a big lie! why are they doing it?!" and my own personal issue - Looking at men smoking is a huge turn on for me.

Why do I suddenly care? How to go back into being a content non-smoker?

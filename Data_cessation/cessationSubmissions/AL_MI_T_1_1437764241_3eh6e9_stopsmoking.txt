I'm back on the road.

I originally quit May 9th 2014 I had a total of 3 cigarettes after I quit each one was put out within a few drags cause I could no longer stand the taste.

I made it till June 15 2015 I was at the tail end of a stressful relationship. I broke down and bought my first pack in over a year. I never got back above a pack a week. I chose when my last pack was finished I was done.

I'm now going on day 3 no smoking. I was offer by someone that they would buy me a pack if I ran and grabbed them one. As I ride to the store I ran everything thing through my head. When asked what I needed at the counter I only said what the other person asked for nothing else. 

After the transaction I walked out of the store headed back and felt truly bet then I have in months. I know this won't hit front page it be flooded with upvotes but maybe someone see's this and its that final push to help them start down their own road.

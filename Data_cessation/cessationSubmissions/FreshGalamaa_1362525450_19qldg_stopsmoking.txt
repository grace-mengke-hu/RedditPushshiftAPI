Today is my 15th day of being Cigarette free, but yesterday I bought an E-Cig for the first time...I can't help feeling that I am failing. Am I?

I knew buying it would be a bad idea. Today is day 15. I have the gum as a back up but I have been using it sparingly (like days in between pieces sparingly). I took a puff of the E-Cig and it felt great honestly. But it also felt like I shouldn't be doing this. I am so afraid that I will fall back into this awful habit and lose all the progress I just made. Am I cheating with the e-cig?

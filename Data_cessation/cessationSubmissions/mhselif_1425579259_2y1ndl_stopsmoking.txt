Today makes 1 year :O

So today, makes my 1 year of not smoking, honestly never thought I'd make it to this point figured somewhere along the lines I'd go back to it but through out it all just kept moving forward 1 year down rest of life to go. 

To everyone still trying it is possible just gotta keep focus and remember the only thing stopping you form quitting is yourself.

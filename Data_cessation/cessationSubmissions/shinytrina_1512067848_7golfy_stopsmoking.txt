Had such a headache

I took a taxi today to my docs appointment and I could tell by the smell that he must of had had a cigarette before getting in his car and coming for me.  On the way to the appointment I got such a headache.  I ended up taking a couple of Advil after getting out and was fine.  Anyone else have this happen to them?

Day 23 update...

I feel pretty awesome. Eating better, exercising regularly. More productive. 350 odd cigarettes not smoked. Â£50 saved. 

To anyone thinking of quitting, just do it! You have so much to gain its great.

To any recent stoppers, hang in there - I am thinking about cigarettes between 10 and 100 times less than a couple of weeks ago. Thinking back, I thought I would be plagued by pangs and thoughts about smoking for months/years. I'm just getting on with normal (better quality) life now. Haven't checked this sub for a week or so or looked at my phone app.

To those ahead of me, Does it still get better? Ie do I still have noticeable health/breathing benefits to look forward to?

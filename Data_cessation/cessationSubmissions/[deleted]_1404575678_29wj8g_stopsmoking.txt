Made in a month...

I feel better, but i feel lost. Not having my major vice is odd, but I will solider on. I'll be twenty-three in a few days and at least I'll be smoke-free then. Here's to another month; keep fighting the good fight friends!

**Edit:** I meant 'Made it a month' as my title. Oh well.

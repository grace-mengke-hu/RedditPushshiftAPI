Day 5

Weirdly have almost no cravings. I feel many other symptoms; insomnia, excessive saliva, coughing, mood swings and irritability. But not really craving a smoke. I also found myself walking behind a smoker and realizing how much those things stink for the first time in years.

Maybe it's the pregnant wife begging me to quit since her smell is hyperactive and can't stand it now. Becoming a father is also a great motivation for quitting.

Just had to share, it didn't feel this way last time I tried. I finally geel like it'll stick this time.

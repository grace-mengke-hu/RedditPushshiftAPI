Been tobacco free for a few weeks, but worried about the health risks in these e-cigarettes

Quit a few times over the past decade, but it never sticks for more than six months. Just like blowing smoke. If I'm not constantly active, meaning three-a-day workouts, then I'm gonna end up wanting to blow smoke rings and relax from time to time. Course one is never enough, and I always end up back at a pack a day.

This time I'm opting for e-cigarettes. Quitting was a lot easier. Usually I'd need to take a day off and basically sleep through the 24 hours of nicotine withdrawal. This time I just tossed my pack and puffed on the e-cig whenever I got a craving. Enough nicotine in the juice that I still have that. Figure I'll keep lowering the dosage over the next two months.

I'm pretty happy with this device. I don't smell like tobacco, and I can smoke indoors without offending anybody. I'm worried about health risks though. Any studies out on these? Most of what I've seen is just concerned with whether or not they can help you quit the cigs, or with nicotine being more randomly distributed in the fuel than the labeling suggests. That and people banning their sale because there's no buying age and these are some sort of gateway drug for kids.

Are the same health risks from smoking tobacco present in e-cigarettes? Are there additional risks? I'm near the point where I could give up tobacco for good without one of these, but I really like the fixation of smoking, and if these things aren't going to give me lung cancer or give me cardiovascular troubles, then I like the idea of having them.

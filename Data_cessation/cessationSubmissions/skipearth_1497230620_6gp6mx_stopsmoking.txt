Today is day 4 and this sucks!

I quit and I am on day 4 and still getting major cravings and still im still an angry jerk. 

I will stay a non smoker for good and I have been jogging every night which makes me realize what 20 years of smoking did to me. I can not run 1/4 a mile without being out of breath but I will change that. 

I needed to vent and i need somw support. I never want to smoke again!

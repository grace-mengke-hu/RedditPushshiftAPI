Video link: how I quit smoking, experiences and advice

[My experiences (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFEyvMdZls0)

Hey everyone,

My wife has had a sudden impulse to record a number of interviews with me, and she's been editing videos together from some of that footage. I remember lurking here a couple of years ago when I quit smoking myself and thought someone might find some solace in my story and experiences. Linked at the top.

Good luck everyone, you can do it!!

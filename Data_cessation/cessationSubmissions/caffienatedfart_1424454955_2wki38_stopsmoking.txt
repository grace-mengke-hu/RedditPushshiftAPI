Over a month of not smoking!!!

Gentlemen, I did it.....over a month of not smoking! Thank you! Thank you, for all your encouragement and stories, you seriously have no idea how many people you inspire to quit smoking everyday!!!
I am now encouraged to pursue other health goals. I have always wanted to be a runner, and I get the feeling running will be a lot easier without that f*cking poison in me. So yeah, wish me luck and thanks everyone. If you're struggling right now, don't worry, I promise you it gets better

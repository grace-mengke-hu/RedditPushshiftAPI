Day 8 complete

Couple of cravings in the last 24 hours. The cravings seem to be bad when I am hungry, at lunch time. Or may be because I used to smoke when I was hungry. Still looking for something that can replace smoking and that gives me pleasure. Soft drinks are bad for health, chewing gums are bad for teeth and stomach. There should be something. I will keep looking. Thanks for reading.

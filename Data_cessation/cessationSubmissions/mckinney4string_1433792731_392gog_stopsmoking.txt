Tore Up Half A Pack On Friday, Day 3 Blues, Insomnia

I'm on Day 3 after smoking a pack a day for over 20 years (yes, that's about $36K) and having a few issues.

*Can't sleep

*Expected irritation

*Odd, "drunken" feeling

I know that this is all my body's reaction to withdrawal.  And while I can handle the latter two, it's the lack of sleep that is starting to exacerbate things.  Don't get me wrong, I'm NOT going back, just would like to get a night's sleep without being doped up.

Thanks for all your support!!!

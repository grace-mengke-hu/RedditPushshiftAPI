It's happening

8:22 AM, January 2, 2014.

I walked outside in 2 degree weather just to get my fix. It has been less than 5 minutes since my last cigarette. Hopefully I can turn minutes to hours and hours to days and days to months and months to years. I'm not even 20 yet and I can already tell that it is holding me back. This isn't how I wanted to spend the most free years of my life; completely dependent on a little buzz that I rarely feel anymore. The community here looks good. It looks like something that could help me get over this silly part of my life. I truly hope it can.

Thanks for reading.

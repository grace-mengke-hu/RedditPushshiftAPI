Quitting cold turkey....with cannabis?

Has anyone else had any success using cannabis to help quit smoking cigs? 3 days completely nicotine free for me and aside from the occasional craving for a cigarette after the habitual triggers (eating, driving, and drinking) I haven't had any physical withdrawal symptoms or irratability I've heard the horror stories about. I've used cannabis regularly for as long as I've smoked and I'm using no more than usual,  actually less than normally I would've in the same 3 day span, and truly believe the cannabis is helping with the withdrawal symptoms.  Anybody else out there found success using cannabis to quit smoking without nicotine replacement?

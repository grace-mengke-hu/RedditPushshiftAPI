I really want to quit again.

Hi all,

I'm a smoker, been a smoker since my 16 (30 now)  i stopped smoking 2,5 years ago. Went well for 1year but broke up wit my so and started smoking the same night.  Now smoking again for little over a year. I really want to quit but I have a fear of failing again. My job is kind of hard and frustrating. I'm a motion designer who works a lot out of my comfort zone. It's good for my learning curve but so frustrating when something doesn't really work. I fear of quiting on Monday and relapsing when I'm frustrated about something that doesn't want to do what I want it to do at work.

You guys have any tips?
I'm reading the force of habit right now maybe that will help.
I really want to quit but the relapsing and failing part really got me.

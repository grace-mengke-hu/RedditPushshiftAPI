1001 Smokeless Nights

So, I'd say I can safely call myself a non-smoker now. Life has been great. 

There was a strange happening tonight; I was at a bar, which I'm usually not. I was at a play rehearsal and went out to a bar afterwards even though I'm very much not a night life sort of person. I stepped outside with my company so that they could smoke cigarettes and stood right downwind of a cigarette and got a face full of that old odour and flavour. I don't think I had actually smelled a cigarette since the time I quit. 

It still smelled fucking amazing, exactly as suited to my taste as it once was. I always really loved the scent and taste of cigarette smoke, and was a connoisseur of tobacco. I used to smoke two packs a day, often fine brands. I had 40 cigarettes the day before I quit and 0 on the day. So, that taste still hasn't left me. I sampled that odour and felt ecstasy.

Yet, in spite of remarking on the pleasant charm of the scent, I had no desire to have a cigarette whatsoever. The thought didn't even occur to me. It hasn't for a very long time, now.

I found it relatively easy to quit. I think I smoked primarily for the taste and for the conviction that life was not worth living. It seemed apparent to me that life wasn't terribly valuable and not easily endurable, but not too horrible as to commit suicide. So, smoking was an easy compromise in this situation. Eventually I found through a change in perspective that I enjoyed living rather a lot, and then I quit smoking three days later.

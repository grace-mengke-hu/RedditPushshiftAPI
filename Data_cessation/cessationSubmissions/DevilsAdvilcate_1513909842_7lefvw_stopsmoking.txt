Could'a, should'a, would'a been one year...

This would have been my one year, and I didn't even plan to check in at this time.
I hit the 6-month mark, and thought I was in control; there is no way to control this. So, now I am back to where I started. 
Last cigarette was 4-days ago. The reason I quit this time is lung pain. Hopefully, just irritation.

I'm almost 30, and wasted the between part of my life with this demon. To the young ones out there... you can do better, you have to do better.

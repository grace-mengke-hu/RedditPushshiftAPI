Hello, I'd like to quit

.. but I think I need accountability and support to do so. So if anyone feels like helping me with that I'd really appreciate it. I have a vape, but I'd rather quit completely. I've done it before and I hope I can do it again. I'm currently smoking about 12 roll ups a day. I'm not sure if I should try and quit cold turkey, or try and cut down. Thank you

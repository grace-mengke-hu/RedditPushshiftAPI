Reflecting on one whole year!

Hi y'all. It's been one year for me! I felt it would be positive for me, and perhaps others, to see a retrospective list of things that seem important.

* I can walk and run without getting winded at all.

* My doctor called me an exceptionally healthy young woman and a great candidate for surgery (repair from a motorcycle accident).
 
* I can smell and taste everything.

* I never have cravings any more.

* I find the smell of cigarettes nauseating.

* I never have to go out alone or in the cold any more.

* My mental health is perfect - the anxiety and depression I thought I had? It was all from smoking.

* I'm so much more productive and prolific with my creative work, and focused than I ever was before.

* I'm proud of myself and know I can tackle big projects and see them through.

* I smell fucking *awesome*. 

* I have no problem drinking.

* People respect me more as a non-smoker.

* My skin is clearer.

* I have saved thousands of dollars.

* I never feel worried about the smell anymore.

* I don't cough in the mornings.

* I rarely get sick, and when I do it's not bad at all.

* My chest never hurts.

* My fingernails aren't stained.

* My hair is so much nicer.

* I never feel my heart race in a scary way.

* I feel happy, confident, and proud.

* I got into wearing pretty lipsticks to show off my nice, non-chapped lips.

* I never feel nauseous the way I did sometimes while smoking.

* I have absolutely zero regrets from the long list of excuses my brain used to come up with. Not a one. 

For anyone just starting out on the rest of their life, believe me - you can do it, and it's amazing. Even if you're older, and you feel like there might not be much point, remember: every moment feels twice, three times, no, a hundred times more enjoyable than the time you spend smoking. Life is so, so, so much better. I had no real idea just how great it was going to be. I couldn't even imagine! There hasn't been a single negative result. I hope anyone who might be scared or might be on the fence takes a little bit of hope from this!

Day one, quit date is finally here.

Trying the nicotine patches this time. Tried several times to quit and I have a good feeling about this one. Cold turkey, gum, and e-cigs have all failed.

Every other time with those I typically relapsed in about 5 days. Longest I've gone since I started was 6 months, and I have been kicking my ass about starting again after so long.

The patches are actually helping. I was very skeptical about them, but I wanted to try something I hadn't yet. It's been roughly 13 hours now, and my cravings for nicotine are at a very manageable state.

Been reading this sub for about two weeks and I love your quit stories. I believe this sub is very beneficial to people who are quitting. It's nice to know I can come here to get some support when having bad cravings. (Have family support too, but more support is always welcome)

Sorry for the long post, I'm just very excited!

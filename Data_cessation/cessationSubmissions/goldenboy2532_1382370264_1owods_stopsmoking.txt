A time to quit

I am in the peculiar position of having health anxiety and smoking a pack a day.  I constantly worry about my health, cancer, heart, etc; yet I pollute my body with marlboro silver 72s.  As someone with Pectus Excavatum I already suffer from shortness of breath and GERD, so I know the smokes are just making it worse.  I have been reading "the book" and it makes a lot of sense, but I struggle with will power..  

It's time to bite the proverbial bullet and free my lungs from the sickness of addiction.  Would it be much harder to stop in the middle of the day?  should I start fresh tomorrow? 

Sorry, I know this post was all over the road and may not have made much sense

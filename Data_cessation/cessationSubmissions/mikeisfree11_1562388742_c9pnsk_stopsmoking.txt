This sucks

After 31 years I am going to try and stop smoking. I haven't  had a cigarette in over 3 years but I am vaping which is just as bad. I hate being a slave to this shit. I am only 46 but my bad habits makes me feel like I am 76. The past month after 3 rounds of antibiotics and a round of steroids, I still feel like I have bronchitis. I hope I haven't fucked my lungs up. Anyway, I really hope I can do this......

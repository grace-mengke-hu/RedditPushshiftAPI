Over 50 days since my collapsed lung!

My lung collapsed by a third, the pain was excruciating and I had to have a tube stuck in my chest for two days, but now I'm so disgusted and repulsed by cigarettes that I could never smoke again. I guess what I'm trying to say is my spontaneous pneumothorax was truly a blessing in disguise. I'm 23 and I smoked from the age of 15.

Anyone else here quit after having a pneumothorax?

Around the world in 80 days?

I wish I could say in the last 80 days I've been traveling the world, but alas, this is not the case. I can tell you all, that the last 80 days have certainly been one hell of an adventure. 80 days ago, I said no more smoking. 80 days ago, I began running again. 80 days ago I couldn't run half a mile without gasping. Today I ran 4K and it felt amazing. Today I took a deep breath and didn't cough. In less than 2 months I will be running my very first 5k race. 

P.S. I should start putting would-be cigarette pack money aside when I do get those rare cravings and save for a real trip around the world (or maybe just to Paris ;) )

21 days in. I don't know if i can take it much long.

Ok title might be little exaggerating, I do not have cravings like I used to before, I do not reach for my pack when I get up. But the cravings hit hard when it hits. This might be my craving talking. I have no intentions to smoke!!!, Should I buy a E-Cig?

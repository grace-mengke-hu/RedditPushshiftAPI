Hey guys I just came here to say...

You guys are really strong. Quitting smoking is much more difficult than I thought it was but its really worth it. Some of you guys have stopped smoking for months and even years and I just have to say you guys are my role models. Right now I just caved in and smoked one after 5 days. I'm still working on it though because before I never quit for as long as 5 days (and I could've gotten a pack anytime).

I do feel ashamed of myself because trust me that cigarette I smoked was NOT worth it, I just felt like I betrayed myself and I felt like a loser. I just want to say you guys are strong and I hope someday I can be as strong as you guys.

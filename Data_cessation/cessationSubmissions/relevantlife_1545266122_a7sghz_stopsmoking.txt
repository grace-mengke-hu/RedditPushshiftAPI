Forgot to post. Made it one month. Probably the first time in ten years I've gone this long without a cigarette. If I can do it, YOU can fucking do it!

It has been over a month since I had my last cigarette. Feels amazing. I walked up one of the biggest hills in town the other day, and I didn't have to stop out of breath even once! 

My sense of taste and smell are incredible, well, really just how it is for everyone who doesn't smoke. 

Anxiety has been a little bit of a bitch, but at the end of the day it's worth it. 

I will never smoke a goddamn cigarette again!

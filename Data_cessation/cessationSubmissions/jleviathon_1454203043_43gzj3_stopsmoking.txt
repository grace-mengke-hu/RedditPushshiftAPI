Day 70 and wanted to ask some things

I'm on day 70 and for the last 2-3 weeks I've had bad shivers at night and then high fever and felt like a sauna.  About 8 times now.  Recently I've been coughing up and blowing out of my nose a really nasty smelling phlegm.  Anyone experience this?  Is this normal for cleansing.  It's so nasty!

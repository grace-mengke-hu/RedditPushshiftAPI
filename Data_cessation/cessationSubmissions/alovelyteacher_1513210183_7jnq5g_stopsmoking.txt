My quit

Hey. I am new on here and the sole reason I joined was for support in my quit. I had my last cig this passed Sunday and I downloaded a really great app that's motivating me to stay strong. I'm feeling pretty good this time. But there are of course times I really miss it. I just keep redirecting my thoughts back to those horrific commercials every time I want a smoke. Any advice when I can't stop thinking about that nice after meal cig? Thanks

Very tough weekend, not sure why

This weekend was white knuckle.  Every drive, every activity, everything triggered a really strong response.  I don't know why, I know that my rationalizations are false, it didn't work 6 months ago, I know it won't work now, but still my addiction tried very hard to convince me that a single cigarette was just the ticket I needed to achieve happiness.

Thankfully it has subsided somewhat today, being at work helps.  I'm not going to smoke again, but damn if that wasn't annoying.

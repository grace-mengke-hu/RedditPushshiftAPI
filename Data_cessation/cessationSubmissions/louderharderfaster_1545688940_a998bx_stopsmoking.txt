July 2017- Now. Much better lung function, saved all that money, LOVE not smoking BUT I still have "gunk" in my lungs?

I smoked for a very long time and so expected I would have a lot of gunk start to, er, well, come up. So far nothing though. Does anyone else share this concern? If so, is there an expectorant I can apply or a process I can use to clear/clean my lungs? I've Googled this and there is not a lot of helpful info. 

TIA!

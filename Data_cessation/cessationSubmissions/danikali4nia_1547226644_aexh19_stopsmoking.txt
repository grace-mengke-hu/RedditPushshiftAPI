15 years today!

Quitting smoking was one of the best things I ever did in my life! I am so proud to be un-brainwashed thinking there was some benefit to those nasty, cancer sticks! If you are in the process of quitting, stick with it! PM me if you need any support or advice. Happy Friday you quitters!

Potential health issue advice

Hey all, I smoked for 7 years (menthols if that makes a difference), then switched to vaping for about a year, then finally got off with the help of nicotine lozenges and other mints. Now, I've been smoke free for probably a year. However, I seem to always have mucus in the back of my nasal cavity / throat, causing me to have to clear my throat very frequently. I am not hacking up anything gross, but I have to do the "loogie" noise. Besides annoying me, feeling that I always have something dripping down my throat, I feel that it's gross to others. I take an allergy pill every day, so I'm not sure that it's that.   


Has anyone else had this issue? Is this something I need to see a ear, nose, throat doctor about? Any advice/help would be much appreciated.

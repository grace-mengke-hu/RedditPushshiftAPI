I’m so ready to quit but idk how I should go about it.

I’m getting through my last hardcore semester of college. I’m telling myself once finals are done that’s it I’m quitting. But in January I’m going on school trip for my last couple of units. Wer going to be in the dessert for awhile. Whenever I’ve tried to quit I get frequent migraines for like a month. I’m worried if I cold turkey I’m just going to be miserable in the dessert. Has anyone tried the patches? Will that get me through it?

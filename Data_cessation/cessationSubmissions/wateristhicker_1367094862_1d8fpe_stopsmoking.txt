3 months today.

3 months ago I finished Allan Carr's book, I gave away the rest of my pack and pledged I would never inhale another one of those nasty things again. I felt elated. The hardest part after that was the firsts, first time drinking coffee and alcohol without smokes, first time going for a long walk and so on. I realized just going through my life that I really did not need them and I sure as hell didn't want them. Lately though its been a bit of a struggle; I live a stressful life and I admittedly do not have the best coping strategies. I'm getting better but I have gained alot of weight and sometimes a cigarette seems so tempting like a fix it all, but its not and everyday I face something shitty without my crutch I feel confident that I will never smoke again.

3 weeks done

Funny thing, it doesn't seem to be as much of an accomplishment as the first 2 weeks, but I'm staying on top of it. Now for my best story of the week:

My wife, smoker, has been helping her mother for the past month and coming home on weekends. I think her absence has helped this quit significantly. Last night, on the way out, she asked to stop for smokes. 

When I pulled up to the convenience store, I just turned off the truck and sat. She was on her phone for a while before she noticed I wasn't going in. I got "the glare," and I busted out laughing.

It's the little things, like not smoking, that can be fun. Not another puff, guys and gals!

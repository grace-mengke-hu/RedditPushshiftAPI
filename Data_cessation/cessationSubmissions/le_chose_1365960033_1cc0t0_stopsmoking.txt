I was jealous of the iphone application to quit smoking... (for linux users)

decide to make my own, code quite ugly because written in bash, (my programming skillz sucks)

you can adjust the values according to how much you smoke and how much cost a pack in your area

to do so, just change the value after the multiplication sign(*) on the lines :


echo "you did not smoke $(echo $HOLDINGFOR/60/60*1.5 | bc) nasty cigarettes"
echo "you saved $(echo $HOLDINGFOR/60/60/24*7.5 | bc) \$, meh, it is a few bucks"


wish me luck, trying cold turkey once again...

cigarettes are the worst thing in my life.





\#!/bin/bash
VALUE=345600
CIGGSNOTSMOKED=0
MONEYSAVED=0
HOLDINGFOR=0

while [[ $VALUE -le 345600 ]];

do

VALUE=$(($VALUE-1))
HOLDINGFOR=$(($HOLDINGFOR+1))
DAYS=$(($VALUE/60/60/24))
HOURS=$(($VALUE/60/60-DAYS*24))
MINUTES=$(($VALUE/60-DAYS*24*60-$HOURS*60))
SECONDS=$(($VALUE-$DAYS*24*60*60-$HOURS*60*60-$MINUTES*60))

HOLDINGFORDAYS=$(($HOLDINGFOR/60/60/24))
HOLDINGFORHOURS=$(($HOLDINGFOR/60/60-$HOLDINGFORDAYS*24))
HOLDINGFORMINUTES=$(($HOLDINGFOR/60-$HOLDINGFORDAYS*24*60-HOLDINGFORHOURS*60))
HOLDINGFORSECONDS=$(($HOLDINGFOR-$HOLDINGFORDAYS*24*60*60-HOLDINGFORHOURS*60*60-$HOLDINGFORMINUTES*60))

echo "time left before total withdrawal $DAYS days $HOURS hours $MINUTES minutes and $SECONDS seconds , hold on!"

echo "you did not smoke for $HOLDINGFORDAYS days $HOLDINGFORHOURS hours $HOLDINGFORMINUTES minutes and $HOLDINGFORSECONDS seconds, good!"

echo "you did not smoke $(echo $HOLDINGFOR/60/60*1.5 | bc) nasty cigarettes"

sleep 1 

clear

exit 0

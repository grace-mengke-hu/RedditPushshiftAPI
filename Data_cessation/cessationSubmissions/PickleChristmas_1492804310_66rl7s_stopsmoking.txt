About to take the plunge...again. Need advice on working from home & quitting.

I'm quitting tonight. I'm finishing my last five ciggies in the pack and calling it a day. Problem is, I'm petrified. I've been undergoing treatment for some long-neglected mental health issues and I've gotten to the point where I feel so out of control of my own actions.

I was smoke free for two years until last April, when I made some big, stressful life changes. In that time I've gained 40 pounds, lost my drive to work and live and started smoking almost a pack a day. I feel like I have an uphill battle in every area of my life and I'm terrified to fail at this one and what it will mean for my ability to make progress in others. 

Besides pouring my heart out, if anyone has advice for me that would be wonderful. Specifically, does anyone have experience quitting that works full time from home? I am extremely undisciplined with my hours and find myself taking a smoke break pretty often as a way to chill out. I'm afraid without structure I'll be zombie driving to the nearest gas station for my next pack.

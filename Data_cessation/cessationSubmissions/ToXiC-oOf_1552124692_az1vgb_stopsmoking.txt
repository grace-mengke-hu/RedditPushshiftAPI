6 days without smoking. I am fucking angry.

Not really any painful symptoms like headaches.  Just coughing and congestion despite never coughing when I smoked. I am completely fucking pissed off though. I am just fucking mad. I started swearing at my glass of water because the ice cubes melted too fast. A little bit ago I slammed a door that kept slowly shutting on its own when I wanted to stay open for a moment. Everything is fucking infuriating. Had to get off Facebook before I saw a post that annoyed me to prevent me from losing my shit at someone.

Yeah yeah I know this is totally normal and plenty of you will be like pfft whatever this is not even that bad, but go fuck yourself. Sorry, kind of.

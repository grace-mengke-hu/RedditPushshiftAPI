On the patch and have some questions.

I'm on the 14mg patch right now and it has been a couple of weeks since my last cigarette. Usually I don't put one on until the cravings really start to get to me (usually about mid-afternoon) and take it off before I go to bed. When would be a good time to start going down to the 7mg? I only had the 21mg for a week and could barely keep them on since they made me feel sick. Should I keep doing what I'm doing and go down to the 7 (is it worth the 20-40$ is what I'm really asking) or just stop after the 14?

One Month as a Non Smoker - depression

Hey All - so I’m happy to say I’ve made it one month. It’s been interesting to see the different types of cravings there have been. 

First were physical. 
Next we’re association 
And now - I want one because it feels like my brain and body are screaming for dopamine. 

I know that a cig won’t taste good. Or smell good. But I’ve been so depressed (crying, intense physical feelings of pain and despair, etc) that - I want anything that will give me pleasure. I ate a brownie last night and the oral fixation combined with the sugar release was almost orgasmic (okay not literally but it was a release). 

I know stopping smoking messes with dopamine and I know it will come back but how long did it take for you guys? 

I’m getting into cbt therapy soon and have a burlesque class I’m starting tomorrow and I’ll be going to the gym tomorrow as well. I know exercise will help but I am not having a good time here haha. 

Let me know any advice you have or how long it took for this to go away. Thanks :)

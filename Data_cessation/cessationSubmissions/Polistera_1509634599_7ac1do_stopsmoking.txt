Overcame big hurdle... Drinking a few glasses of wine while sitting across a smoker

I had purposely been avoiding my smoking friends in the first few weeks in order to cement my non-smoking towards myself. It's easier to fall off the wagon if you have only stopped for a few days than when you have been smoke-free for a few weeks. 
Last night I had dinner with a friend of mine and we had a few glasses of wine. After dinner, he took out his cigarettes and that's when my first real craving in these two weeks hit me. My mind literally started arguing with me, thinking up reasons why it wouldn't be the end of the world if i smoked one cigarette, what's the harm, can start stopping again the next day etc... 
I then reminded myself of this Reddit forum and decided to concentrate very intently on what my friend was saying and to keep the conversation flowing. The monster crave lightened and the odd resurgent thought about smoking was much lighter. 
Thanks guys, for getting me through yesterday evening. This is the first time i have quit smoking while talking about it online and i feel it is really helping stay on the right path.

Avoiding smoking when drinking

I'm on day 22 and I'm so happy about it. 

The only problem now is when I'm drinking it absolutely kills me not to smoke! How long did it take for the rest of you for this not to be such an issue?

I've drank a few times and not smoked and I'm trying to look at it as it'll just get easier each time I do it. I'm training myself? I'm often in environments where people are just smoking around me, inside clubs and parties so unfortunately can't even just let them go out to smoking areas and stay inside.

Help!

Waiting for the other shoe to drop

I just passed 72 hours and everything is fine. Like, way better than I expected. I did have a small amount of nicotine yesterday afternoon in the wrap of a blunt I smoked with some people, but other than that nothing. I woke up Friday with two cigarettes left  and thought “what if I don’t go buy more?” so I didn’t. I don’t feel any strong cravings or feel triggered. I’ll have a reflex to smoke but it passes as soon as I remind myself that’s not me anymore. I did start taking CBD for anxiety a couple weeks ago and am wondering if that’s related. I’ve also continued using cannabis. Has withdrawal just not hit me yet? This is supposed to be harder, right? In 11 years, I’ve never gone longer than 10-12 hours without a cigarette. I’ve tried to quit before and have wound up crying and shaking. Now I just feel a bit irritable in passing, but it’s easy enough to mask. I feel like I’m doing it wrong somehow.

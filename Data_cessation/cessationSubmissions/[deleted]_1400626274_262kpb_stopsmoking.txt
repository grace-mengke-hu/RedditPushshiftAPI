Get smoking smell out of clothes?

Hey everyone, I'm a young teenager with a (Eastern European) dad that smokes. He's smoked pretty much ever since I was born, and I've always had smoke smell in my clothes (which ever kids would comment on, which sucks). Now he smokes outside (woo!) and sometimes in his car.

Anyways, the smoke smell is less prevalent now but is there any way to get it out? I'd also like  to know other remedies to get smoke smell out of a car (he smoked in it in the winter), apartment (you can sense it a little when you walk in from the outside) and the couch (you can smell it if you put your nose to it). I'm on the couch a couple of hours after school so it might be rubbing on my clothes as well.

Sorry for the rant guys, I just REALLY hate smoke smell and hope you guys have ways to get rid of it :)

Day 1. Once more unto the breach.

It is Sept 30. Last chance this year to get in a three full months of being a non-smoker. I think the 3-month mark is critical. I will count myself a free man when I get there. 

After twenty years of smoking I quit for ten. Felt perfectly natural to be a non-smoker. Just stupid that I had a smoke at a party and started thinking I could have the occasional one. Five years later I can't quit smoking half-a-pack a day, just like before.

I made a few attempts with mixed success, partly thanks to this stopsmoking group. Last run at it folks. I am determined. I am optimistic. I will use what worked in the past, and use this group again to get me through day by day. Cheers.

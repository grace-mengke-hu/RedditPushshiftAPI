How can I help my mother stop smoking ?

Today she told me that she didn't want to.

She said that of course, it costs too much and it's unhealthy and she'd be better off without it, but that she didn't have the will, the motivation.

It seems to me like she wants to quit, but she doesn't want to go through all the trouble that's involved. She doesn't want to gain weight, she doesn't want to feel terrible for months.

She's a really heavy smoker, I'm not counting but I usually see her chain them within 10 minutes of each other. It must be dozens per day. She tried to quit several times, but I don't know the details.

She also feels like now isn't the right time, it has to be later. She's been feeling unhappy for a while, so she wants to wait until things are better. She even told me not now, because it's winter and she doesn't like winter. Suggesting that maybe she was making excuses didn't work.

The thing is, I have no clue what smoking is like, what being addicted is like, how smokers are supposed to quit. I don't know how hard it is or what you feel like when you stop.

I suggested that she should count how many cigarettes she smokes per day and try to slowly decrease the amount, even if it's 1 per week - at least there's an improvement, a reason to be proud of yourself and a silver lining to it, but she's of the opinion that she should quit overnight.

How does one quit smoking ? Is it better to do it progressively or go all in ? I picked up a book while browsing this subreddit, "Easy Way to Stop Smoking" by Allen Carr, did it help for anyone here ? Any other good books that can help ? Is there a better time to quit than now ? Is there a way to quit without gaining weight ?

I just had my last smoke, please tell me your experience how quitting improved your face.

I have become a huge addict, so much that I plan my day accoring to my  smokes. My face condition has become bad and I am 21 and look like 30 year old man. I am tired of feeling shit. Please tell me some good things about quitting.

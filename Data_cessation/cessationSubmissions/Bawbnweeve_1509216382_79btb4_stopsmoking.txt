I’m really depressed

I’m 38 days in and my depression is really starting to scare me. When did it stop for you?

I feel like the worst wife and mother. Nothing I do is good enough or right. And the only thing that’s changed is I don’t smoke anymore. 

I don’t trust pills or psychiatric places so I’m really feeling stuck and awful. And my husband kids friends and family are all happily oblivious even though I’ve expressed my current situation. Which is fine because if I stress them out I’ll just feel like an even bigger loser. This is a big hamster wheel of hell. 

But I’m not smoking still so that’s something. Thanks for letting me vent. Here’s to hoping my brain figures this out.

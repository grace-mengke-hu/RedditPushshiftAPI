77 days!

After many many quit attempts I feel this is the one that has finally done it for me. I just want to thank you all for the support and posts(I look at them all the time to keep me focused on the goal). Unfortunately, I've got a bachelor party coming up next weekend and everyone in the group smokes including the groom who was the one who introduced me to it in the first place. Im going into it treating it as another trigger I can overcome, wish me luck!

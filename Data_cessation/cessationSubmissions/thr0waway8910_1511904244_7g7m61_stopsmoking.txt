Chain-smoking anxiety quitting

I'm going through a really long and difficult separation and originally I was drinking more but instead of drinking now I'm smoking pretty much chain smoking like a pack a day or something for the last week I've never really smoked before while at least not like this and it was quite a long time ago. But I want to stop and I'm not sure how and I'm wondering also with the effects are and how long after quitting I'll feel better looks physically mentally I'm starting to feel a little hooked. I guess I just have to stop but I'm just having a hard time emotionally right now and I can't seem to get it done.  Any advice would be helpful thank you

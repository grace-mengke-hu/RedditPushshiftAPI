Just Quit Again

I had been clean for 3 1/2 years and on new years I bought a pack. It had been a bit of a bad night and I had grabbed one off a friend thinking I could just have one, the night got worse and I walked to the store and bought a pack. Over the next few days I kept smoking, the first I had about 1, then the second day I had 7 and then today I had 2. I came back into the house after finishing it, having taken the pack out of my car and decided that I would stop, I hid them under the sink. 

5 min later I realized I could still smell them on my hands, that gross reaking smell and I started the water to try and wash it off, I reached under the counter and soaked the whole pack crushing it in my hands. I am going to do everything in my power to never touch those things again.

Last night was brutal

One fleeting craving after the next. Decided to go to bed instead of torture myself. Wasn't difficult getting to sleep because I'm slightly depressed but I woke up at 3am. Mind spinning, all sweaty and shit and I could not get back to sleep. I thought about hopping on the elliptical but I needed rest, my job is taxing. I'll get through it. Just thought I'd share. Sorry for the shit post.

Another helpful app - couch to 5k

For the past three years, I basically gave up on fitness... and smoked. I would, day in and day, out promise myself I would hit the gym or go for a walk or get back into surfing but in the back of my mind I knew smoking was holding me back. 


I loathe running but I love the benefit of exercise. I have a smartwatch and all those apps that promise a new life but I downloaded one last week that is the least complicated and most promising one in my predicament to my phone. It's called couch to 5k. It's a simple, straight forward DOABLE regiment that even I can get through. I highly recommend it for those like me who have quit, know they should be exercising but are daunted by the process. Like I said, I loathe running, but it really is a great option for cardio. 

It is so nice to sweat again! And feel the lungs start to work again after many, many years of smoking and way too long without exercise. 

Hope all my fellow quitters are faring well this weekend. Stay strong!

Best decision ever!

Here's the post that started the journey and changed my life in a massive way. Was a smoker for 5 years.
Been a non-smoker for 1 year now.
2190â‚¬ saved, nearly 7000 cigarettes not smoked and healthier than ever.

Thanks for the support guys, if I can do it, anybody can. Keep going!

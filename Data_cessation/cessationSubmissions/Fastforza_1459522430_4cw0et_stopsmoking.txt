Quitting smoking today.

Hi everyone!
I'm a 22 year old male who's been smoking for 5 years. The tragic thing about me smoking is that i'm a really enthusiastic sports guy, i watch a lot of sports and also play sports like football, basketball, i also enjoy riding a bike and running. Luckily, i haven't been smoking a lot for these 5 years, i've only averaged about 5 cigs per day, except for weekends where sometimes i would smoke to about 10 cigs.

Now i have my last cigarette, and after it, i plan to quit smoking completely and start doing sports again because the cold weather is over at my country! :D 

Cheers

tldr; Quit today to get my life back on track.

I'm currently studying to get my MSc at uni and I have been smoking since I was 14. Am 24 now. If you think that is an early age to start smoking, well, in Austria it really isn't.

I'm studying extra-occupationally, meaning that I work to some extend (60% in my case) and go to university at the same time. Lately, I've been under a lot of stress and felt like quitting EVERYTHING. (maybe a bit too dramatic? - Don't worry, I'm not suicidal) I've gained weight and just generally feel like shit. 

But to the good stuff now:

**Today I decided to quit smoking and get my life back.** 

This will be a complete turn-around of my lifestyle including changing my eating habits and starting to work-out regularly.

Also shout-out to my cheating exgf getting a new boyfriend. That shit really sparked it off. 

Cheers for taking time to read my story. Apologies for the spelling and grammar errors in advance, English is not my first language.

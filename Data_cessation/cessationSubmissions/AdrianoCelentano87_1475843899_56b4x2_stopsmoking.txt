Final try to stop smoking

Hi,
i'm smoking since i'm 14. Both of my parents, my only brother, his wife and 80% of my friends are smoking (basically almost everybody around me). I allready tried to quit the first time when i was around 18. I started again because my non smoking friend told me he gets more drunk when he smokes ... In the last 3 years i had three attempts of trying to quit. All three times the effect of alcohol and problems with a girl made me smoke again. So i know my problems now for sure. I think i'm even a bit more addicted to alcohol than i would admit. This is why i will also stop drinking till Christmas and i guess also dating. I'm 29 years old and i just stopped two days ago. The next days i stay till sunday at my mums place. Then i think the physical addcition is over and it will get easier. So when i stay away from booze and girls till Christmas i think i dit it. After 3 months it should be really easy knowing now how fast i can fall back if just do a single zigarette.

I've realized now is the time. I'm not sure where to start.

This sounds ridiculous but I took I took a selfie on the beach today. It was almost identical to one I took a year ago, however the aging was OBVIOUS. I'm in my late 20s and it is time. I smoke about a half a pack a day, mostly at work and when I'm driving or having a beer. Where do I start!

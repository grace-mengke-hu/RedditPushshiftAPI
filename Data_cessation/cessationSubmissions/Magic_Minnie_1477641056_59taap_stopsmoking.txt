Second attempt and 19 days in...

So I've been smoking for 24 years (I know, right?!) and a year or so ago finally quit. It was easy - I just decided one day not to smoke again and I didn't...well, until almost a year later where a combination of stress at work and lots of Christmas parties meant I started again. That was about a year ago, but I am determined to quit FOREVER this time, and am 19 days in. No patches or e-cigs, just a stop smoking app and will power (and an SO who just looks at me sadly saying he doesn't want me to die. It works!). So yes, I'm proud to be a non smoker and am so pleased to have found this community. WE CAN DO THIS, PEOPLE!! Altogether now: 'Not one more puff, no matter what!' Good luck everyone, stay strong.

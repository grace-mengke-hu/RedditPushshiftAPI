Hell yeah!

Damn, I am in a pretty good mod today! Seeing this Star with #1 in it makes me feelsgood.jpeg. I just noticed it too!

In the light of the recent money savings from not smoking and drinking redbulls, I am strongly considering canceling my Direct TV as well. It's a waste and it's costing me over 130 bucks a month. To get out of my contract, it would be 160 bucks. That will pay off in little over one month. I just don't watch TV that much. Besides, I want to spend my time working out and doing active things. There was a time when I didn't have TV for 2 years and I was just fine. Stupid Direct TV knocked on my door and persuaded me to sign up. 

With that said, just imagine these savings per month:

Not smoking: $150
Morning Redbulls: $70
Direct TV: $130

That is 350 bucks in my pocket. That is $4,200 a year. 4200! That is a lot of freaking money kids! 

As spring is approaching, I want to gear myself up for an active lifestyle. I don't want to be tempted to sit in front of TV. Football is over, so that's that. I pay 130 a month just to watch NFL Network and occasional news. Not worth it. 

Saving this $150 made me truly realize how much money leakage I have. Little by little. I could spend this money on a nice workout equipment. Hell, it's enough to pay for my classes (I am 40 but I am going to college to finish up my bachelors and then MBA). Those things alone would pay for my school! 

I guess here is another benefit of quitting smoking! Becoming a cheap ass! LOL

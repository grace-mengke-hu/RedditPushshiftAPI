For the first time since I quit, I really feel like I need a cigarette today.

I'm quitting my job, and the guilt at leaving my coworkers in a busy time is absolutely overwhelming! Other anxieties related to this change are piling up at the same time, and it feels like too much to deal with. It feels isolating, and like I just need some way to make myself feel better until I can calm down and feel human again. I don't feel like anything else can do that for me. 

I know that smoking doesn't actually solve anything, but I don't know what else to do with this feeling.

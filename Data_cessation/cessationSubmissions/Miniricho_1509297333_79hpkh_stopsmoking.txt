A week of not smoking down the drain.

I don't usually post on Reddit much but I've been lurking on this sub for a while now, and just wanted to rant/vent for a bit.

I had quit smoking a week ago and I thought I was doing well, it was a hot one today in Australia (Melbourne, for those interested) and I joined my mates for a swim at a good friends house. 

Long story short I had a few too many, and I thought I could handle the urge, but it turns out i couldn't. I wanted nothing more than a cigarette today, beer in hand with a hot ass sun but fortunately I had none on me, and I was around non-smokers which did help. The real trouble started when I got home, where I knew I could find cigarettes.

Had a few more beers at home and couldn't handle it anymore so I smoked, and it was gross and made me feel horrible, but I continued and had 3 more. I finished my last cigarette about 10 minutes ago,  and will be quitting again tomorrow. 

I was doing really well, which is the most disappointing part I guess, but this will inspire me to try harder next time, and lucky I don't have the urge to start back up (for now, anyway,) so I'd call this a minor setback!

 Restarting my smoking app and going again, this time for good, and will also try not to drink for a while. Thanks for reading!

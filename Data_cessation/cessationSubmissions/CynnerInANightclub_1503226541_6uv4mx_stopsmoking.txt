Hello ladies who have stopped or are looking at stopping smoking. I have found an awesome side effect.

LOL FTP posting from mobile, etc..

I am up to 32 days off the evil weed, and have found that my period is lighter and way less painful!

I'm pretty sure I noticed this when I stopped briefly a while back, but I've been more conscious of it this time,  as I'm convinced this time is forever.

I spent Christmas day hugging a wheat bag, and waiting for the painkillers to kick in. This time,  I didn't even look for them.  

Yay!

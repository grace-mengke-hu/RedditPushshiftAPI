I quit one year ago. Here's what it was like....

Phew!  Came here to see my star and share how I made it to the one year mark.


* put on a patch for the first 4 days and read Alan Carr's book.  Something clicked in my brain.  You know it when it happens.  When I took that patch off, in my mind, I was now a non-smoker.  I never used the patch again.
* the first two weeks all I thought about were cigarettes.  To get through it I tried to be proud of every craving I powered through.
* about a month in something weird started happening.  I got horny LOL....my breasts also got a little bigger, that lasted about a month.
* after the first month the cravings were easier to get through.
* at milestone dates, I struggled.  Woohooo one week, woohoo one month, 3 months.  For some reason keeping track of the date was reminding me about cigarettes.
* at 3 months in I joined a gym.  I'm in the best shape of my life now and it's been my main motivation not to smoke.  I don't want to ruin all my hard work at the gym.

That's it!  I smoked for 22 years about 1/2 pack a day habit.  For all those people just starting, it's going to be tough but not as bad as you think!  Be proud of moment that goes by without a cigarette.  This sub is an amazing community of people and thank you everyone for posting your stories the good and the bad.  You got me through tough times!

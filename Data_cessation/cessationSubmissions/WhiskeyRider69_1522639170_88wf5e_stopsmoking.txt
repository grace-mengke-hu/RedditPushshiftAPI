Have I cracked?

So, I'm rolling into my 9th day without a cigarette. Granted, I'm vaping with 9mg juice, but considering how heavily I smoked until a week ago, I've still been going through some pretty rough withdrawal. I've had a complete lack of ability to focus on anything, and I was essentially narcoleptic for the first three days after my last cigarette. I can tell that I'm going through physical withdrawals, or at least a serous adjustment to the nicotine intake that I've gotten used to over the last 28 years of smoking.

There's one strange thing this time though, I haven't been crabby. To the contrary, I have actually found myself more jovial than I usually was when I was smoking. I've found humor in things that would have probably made me want to punch someone two weeks ago, and have been laughing a lot more than I did before. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining, but it's just... weird. I expected to be ready to tear someone's head off by now, and by all rights I probably should be, but I'm not. Is it just me? Has anyone else experienced this? Am I just doing the "if I don't laugh I'll cry" thing?

It's strange, but I'm just rolling with it. I'm actually feeling confident about my quit, and I can feel my thinking actually changing this time, as opposed to other times that I have tried. I'm liking it, and can't wait to have some time under my belt. Looking forward to the 365 day flair. Thanks to everyone for the support in this sub. I think it has been one of the things that has made this quit different than all of the others. I don't feel all alone.

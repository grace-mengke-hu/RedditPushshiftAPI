1989-2014, with a four year break.

Hi All,
Just quit cold turkey on the 2nd January.  Wanted to quit before I turned 40, started smoking when I was 15, quit when I turned 30, decided when I was going through a divorce the best way to attract new females was to start smoking again.  Anyway, I'm rambling, this is actually the hardest day I've had for some reason....the lethargy is the real killer when it comes to cravings.  I can feel my find saying "a cigarette will perk you up in no time!"

How to help someone quit without making the other feel bad?

Last month I had lunch with an old friend of mine that we used to sit at home and just smoke away. We got together with other friends to talk about other things and cigaretts came up. Trying to tell her how I did it (after she asked) and seeing how bad she felt was horrible. I know she wants to quit, but I just stoped talking and she didn´t bring it up again and neither did I. I asked another friend if I sounded like I was arrogant or showing off but he said no. 

We are good friends and her sister said that I should motivate her, but I´m totally uncomfortable and will not do it unless she asks for.

Should I keep this up or try to reach her in this matters again?

Mum has end stage COPD horrible way to die

I am.day 4 into quitting.  I smoked 10 per day.  I have watched my mum for the last 7 years hooked up to 24 hour oxygen and I can see first hand what an awful and inhumane way it is to die.    My mum smoke foe years, she gave up 10 years ago at the age of 54.  The damage was done and she Is now slowly suffocating to death...I can assure anyone who has never had experience of the it is the worst possible way to die.  My mum is suffering real bad anD I do not want my daughter to see me like this.  So four days in I'm using an e-cig and fingers crossed feeling determined.  Good luck everbodyssey x

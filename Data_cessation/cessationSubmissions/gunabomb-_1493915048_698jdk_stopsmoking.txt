Can you help with some rationalizations?

Good afternoon everyone!

Last September I stopped smoking for 1 month with the help of Allen Carr's "The Only Way to Stop Smoking". 

I actually felt pretty great; way more relaxed, stopped biting my nails (and the skin around them), smelled way better (god, I could smell a smoker from 1km away), etc.

Until the day before a big exam coming up I suddenly felt the urge.
It didn't feel like a mental urge (like "oh god, I'd really fancy a cig right now"), it was more like an empty stomach feeling; like something was missing. 

I started to get anxious a little later and to add up, I was also very anxious about the exam because I hadn't studied too much. 
I guess y'all know how this ended: deep down I *knew* that a cigarrette would at least subside that empty stomach feeling and went outside to buy a pack although I didn't actually *want* to smoke. 
I felt pretty frustrated because I couldn't get on with my study if didn't calm that feeling. 

I promised myself that I'd stop worrying and smoke and then stop smoking 2 weeks later. But you know the way an addict brain works and here I am.

I think one big reason I hadn't stopped again was because I think I developed a fear. 
A fear of feeling great for a long time (like I was at the time) and then, all of a sudden, having that feeling again upon a situation like the one I explained where I had no time to lose and had to decide between smoking and study or feeling miserable, waiting for it to pass and not studying (I'm a medical student so I guess that'll happen pretty often in the future).

I think it's kind of a meta-fear: a fear of fearing the urge again.
I'd call that **rationalization #1**.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **#2 rationalization** I'd say it's attractive women smoking. 
Yeah, I know it sounds pretty ridiculous but that's the way it is. I realized that, during the times I'm a smoker, I woulnd't give a shit about if a girl smokes or not.

But when I stop, everytime I see an attractive girl I immediately think "I hope she's not a smoker" (which it's not likely because of the people I hang out with and I'm living in Europe) and immediately daydream being with her in the most various occasions (being in the balcony, after sex, etc.) feeling deprived while she's smoking. 

Again, it's more a like an anticipation fear. It's not something that is really happening but I fear it may happen and I can't deal with it and my addict brain rationalizes it into a reason to keep on smoking.


I'm really despising this shitty addiction and I really want to be free but I don't know how to deal with these situations the moment I stop smoking.

Can you help me?

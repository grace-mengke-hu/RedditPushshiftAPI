Gotta do this.... What was your most successful method?

I have half a cig from last night sitting here, as I've been tapering down.  I figure I should just stop now though, since my pouch ran out anyway.  If I have this half it will make it way harder to not have another, and in a way I've already quit for 8 free hours :P

But anyway, what was your way to combat thinking about cigs?  Did you do something else to occupy your time/hands/mouth?

I thought food could work but I pretty much always smoked after eating.... so not sure.

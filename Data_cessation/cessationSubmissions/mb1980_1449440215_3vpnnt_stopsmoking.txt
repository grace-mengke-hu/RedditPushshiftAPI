Need a bit of help.

So I need a bit of help.  I'm over 4 months off the cigarettes, over 3 months off the nicotine.  I do not feel better, in fact, I feel worse.  I get frequent headaches, my sinuses seem over-active (lots of snot / boogers) making it harder to breath, my chest hurts and I'm frequently angry and on edge.   I cannot focus or concentrate at work and have frequent anxiety attacks and have a bit of depression, but that mostly came and went.  I explained this to my doctor and they suggested I see a psychologist and start taking Zoloft.  I saw the psychologist last week and they seemed to agree.  I can't hardly bring myself to start taking medicine that will alter my brain chemistry (Zoloft, or any other SSRI), as I feel as though I'll have traded one drug (nicotine) for another, but it doesn't seem that eating well and exercising are doing the trick.  My doctor seems to think that I was self-medicating with nicotine.  Sure, I've had my good days, but overall, I feel as though I'm on a downward slope.  Has anyone else gotten worse like this for 3-4 months and then come out of it OK after that?

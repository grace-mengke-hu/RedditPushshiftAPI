Day 7 - hanging in

Just checking in. I won't lie, there were some rough patches the last few days. The downtime this weekend almost snapped me. I did my best to stay occupied with yard work, etc. The cravings get a little intense sometimes but they seem to be less frequent. All-in-all can report I have more energy than I'm used to today and I'm enjoying not being the smelly guy in the office. Cheers.

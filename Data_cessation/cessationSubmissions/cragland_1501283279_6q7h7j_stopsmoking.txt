Feelin good, feelin great-- feelin great, feelin good. 
I've been using 4mg Nicorette to stave off withdrawal symptoms. Exercise has been helping too. I'm trying to make sure i don't just replace cigs with pieces of gum, though. Anyone know the best way to ween yourself off nicotine with gum? Will I have to go down to 2mg at some point? Any advice would be appreciated.

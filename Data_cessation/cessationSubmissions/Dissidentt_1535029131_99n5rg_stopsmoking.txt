Today is my four year anniversary of quitting!

Four years ago I decided to buy a vaping unit instead of another carton of cigarettes and I was determined to never buy cigarettes again. I knew that if I could avoid buying more cigarettes, I would be able to free myself from the addiction.

I persisted with the vaping even through some really trying times. Slowly, over 3.5 years I reduced my nicotine level. It is now also 6 months since I quit nicotine all together.

I think I have it licked and I am quite proud of myself.

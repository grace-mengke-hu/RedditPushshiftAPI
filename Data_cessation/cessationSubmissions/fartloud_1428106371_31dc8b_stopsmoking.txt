How do you deal with... well... basically getting fat?

I was insanely skinny when i was in my teens and at around high school... then i started smoking, making my own food etc and i got a boost in weight. It wasnt too bad.... untill a few weeks ago i started reducing my smokes rapidly, relying mostly on e-cig. I still smoke normal cigs once in a while, but basically instead of a pack a day routine i went to a pack a week.

I looked in a mirror yesterday and i was like, ok i wasnt skinny or fit, but what the fuck damn im getting fat. I was never very active and my insane metabolism in my teens have kept me in a mood that well... as long as i dont eat mcdonald food everyday and as long as i dont need whatever like all the time i should be fine right? So i guess the right choice now would be to excersize, but any other tips from smokers that either quit completely or decreased their smoking levels immensely and have experienced weird shit with their weight?

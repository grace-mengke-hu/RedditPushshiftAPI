One week, incredible!

I can't believe it's already been a week. I spent all of last week going on this subreddit at work when it was really tough, and I felt my measly badge was embarassing. Now I feel great about it!

My story is that I started smoking at 20, as part of a period of my life where I became more outgoing and started to become "cool". I've gained a lot of confidence since then, and left a lot of the insecurity that made me start to smoke behind. 

I used to work in fast food where the smoking break was the natural form of socialising and de-stressing, and party with fellow smokers all the time. I had my own small flat where I smoked indoors full time.

Now, my life looks different. I'm 25, I have a roommate who doesn't smoke and no balcony. I have a girlfriend who doesn't smoke and I have a real job at an office where no one else smokes. I feel like the smoking things is some kind of remnant from a previous version of me, that doesn't suit well with my current life at all.

So I decided to quit, and let that part too catch up with all the good stuff that's been happening to me. And I'm doing well so far. Reading others stories here has been really inspiring, and so has the links to the audio version of Allan Carr's book.

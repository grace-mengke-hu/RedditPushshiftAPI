19 and trying to quit.

Hey guys, I've been fighting to quit smoking since I started when I was 17. I wish I had never ever touched the stuff, but I was in the army and it was just a thing to take the edge off sometimes, you know? I've tried three separate times now to quit, once with nicotine gum as a replacement, and twice just cold turkey. Every time, I make it to about a month before I tell myself, hey you've earned one for being good. And thAt starts the whole cycle again. I threw out everything I had yesterday, and so far today I haven't given in. I wanted to know if anyone has any advice for trying to quit cold turkey, because I have no interest in e-cigs and the nicotine gum didn't work.

You guys are awesome

I'm in school studying medicine and just finished a rotation in internal medicine. Basically, 6 weeks of following a doctor around and seeing patients admitted to the hospital from the ER. I also have a background in addiction medicine.

You are young. To have the motivation to quit smoking before it is too late is a blessing. Hundreds of older patients I saw, unfortunately, didn't. The saddest thing I ever saw at the hospital were the eyes of regret. Half of our admissions were smokers or ex-smokers who smoked a pack a day for 20-30 years. The ones who finally quit after they had a stroke which left them with hemiparesis, heart attack which left them with congestive heart failure, or developed oxygen-dependent COPD were the ones I felt the most sorry for. 

You will save so much money, you will live longer, and your quality of life when you are old will be substantially better. I can guarantee it. 

This isn't a scare tactic though, because you already know what smoking does to your health. But I wanted to say that I didn't see many patients who quit when they were in their 20s and 30s, which I hope gives some extra motivation to some of you who are still pretty young. And even if you are older than 40, your life and health will be substantially better if you quit than if you don't. 

I hope this didn't come across wrong, but I'm honestly really proud of you all. It takes a tremendous amount of self-discipline and courage to quit. I have the utmost respect for you guys.

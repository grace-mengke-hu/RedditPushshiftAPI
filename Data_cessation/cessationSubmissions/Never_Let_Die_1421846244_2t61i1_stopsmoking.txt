Currently 22 days clean and in need of advice and guidance.

So I am in need of some advice. Im an 18 male who has been smoking for about a year and a half. On new years eve I quit. I have been staying at a holiday home (because its summer here) for about a month now. The temptations have been fairly low. 
Im worried that when I go back to my home town there is nothing stopping me from going down to the shop and buying a smoke. What do you guys do to deter yourselves from buying smokes? 
Also a large amount of my friends smoke, and I'm worried I'll be temped. I really don't want to start again.  

Edit- Thanks everyone for the advice. I wish myself and all of you luck in your smokeless futures.

Whenever I had the urge to smoke I reminded myself of these three things ...

1. The pleasure I experienced smoking wasn't truly pleasure - it was relief from nicotine withdrawal, which typically hits smokers every two hours. So this false "pleasure" was just the feeling of being free from nicotine withdrawal, i.e. feeling like every non smoker feels roughly all the time. 

2. The relaxation I felt from smoking was also false. Smoking actually increases your heart rate and therefore boosts anxiety. It may momentarily feel like relaxation but again, this feeling is just smoking temporarily relieving the feeling of anxiety created by nicotine withdrawal. So I was smoking to relieve a side effect (anxiety) of smoking. 

3. Smokers go through withdrawal and anxiety roughly every two hours between getting their fix, every waking hour of their lives. So whatever discomfort and anxiety I felt for the first 3 days or so of not smoking (really it was just 2 bad ones) was temporary. The trade off was once I was "free", I would never again have to experience craving nicotine. 

And I'll give you a bonus one: All of the mental time and stress of just planning around smoking. Making sure I had enough cigarettes and my lighter every morning. Making sure to take a cough drop and wash my hands after a smoke so my coworkers didn't know. Making sure my young son didn't accidently see me smoking. Worrying unduly about my health because I knew I wasn't taking care of myself the right way. The list goes on and on.

I'm 3 weeks free and know that I will never, ever look back. Now in hindsight, I see how EASY it is to quit smoking versus how HARD it is to actually be a smoker. If only I knew, I would have kicked it cold turkey years ago.

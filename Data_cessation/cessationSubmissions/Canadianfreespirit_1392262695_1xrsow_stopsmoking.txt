I get anxious even when I still have smokes left

I want to quit smoking. It's just - I am not sure if I really want to quit. I'm aware of the cost, health risks and all of that. I tried the patch and ended up with a patch, a gum and smoking a cig. I've battled alcoholism, been sober for 475 days, but smoking just seems to big an issue. If I make a decision to quit, I basically get nervous when I still have a couple of smokes left. Any ideas/motivation etc.?

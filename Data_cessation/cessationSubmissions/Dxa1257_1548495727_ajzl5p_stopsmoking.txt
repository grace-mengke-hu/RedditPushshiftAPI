Progress Report:

This is my 4th attempt to quit smoking, i have been here earlier and relapsed twice. This time i made the first day of new year as my quit date and boy, i have been killing it.

I had a drinks party on the first weekend in the new year and managed to not smoke any.  Every weekend since was either a drinks party or a blunt and drinks party and i have managed to keep my resolve.

I have also purchased the Smoke free app just to show some commitment to myself and yes it is a lot helpful.

Last party we smoked blunts and had drinks with it, however i was not that high is what my friends thought. So they started offering me smokes late at night when you are about to do the mistakes. The decisions you take past 2am in the morning are the bad decisions.

But what did i manage to pull? When my high friends were trying to shove cigarettes in my mouth, i somehow managed to grab my phone and opened the smoke free app, flashing the dashboard screen in front of them like a holy cross, and it did work out!

My out of mind friends got some sense kicked in and stopped their acts, respecting my resolve. Boy i think it is an achievement on its own.

Yesterday i was drunk again and was thinking about my holiday trip scheduled next month. My mind was trying to convince myself that it is okay on the holiday trip to smoke as long as i dont continue it back at home, i was almost convinced.

But then i was watching Noah (Russel crow) and he was narrating the adam and eve story about the forbidden fruit. That is where i picked up my mantra from and added to my dashboard.

The God gave Adam and eve a choice in regards to the forbidden fruit, (and the mantra follows).

Let me know what you guys think?

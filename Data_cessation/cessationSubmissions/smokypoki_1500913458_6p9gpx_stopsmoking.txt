I'm on Day 4

Hey peeps whats up.

Been smoking 17 years, i really want to quit for good this time. I'm trying the Allen Carr method and also hypnosis.
I'm getting testy and crabby at times, like i want to punch somebody in the face just because lol fucking cravings are driving me nuts !  Venting over here.

any cool tips on how to handle the cravings or withdraw symptoms ?

Thanks in adv

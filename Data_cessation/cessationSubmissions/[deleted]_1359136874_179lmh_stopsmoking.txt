2 weeks! I realise how stupid I looked when I'd dangle a cig out of my mouth, behind my ear...

I didnt look cool, I didnt look badass at all, it was a stupid way to make me feel better about smoking!


My friends recently quit smoking too, he's not doing great so far- he's not smoking but the cravings are killing him, any tips I can throw his way?

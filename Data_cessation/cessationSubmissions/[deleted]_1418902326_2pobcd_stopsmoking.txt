Workplace Tips?

I took some leave days to avoid triggers at work during the most difficult days, but today is my first day back and it's a nightmare. My cravings are getting triggered continuously and I can barely concentrate on anything aside from how much I want a smoke. I'll probably pull through today, but does anyone have some tips to help me through tomorrow?

I did it!

On Mother's Day I was distraught and crying over my baby I lost a few months ago and during that moment I decided to quit smoking and to care more about my health for my lil egg looking down on me. I hope he's proud of me, that's all I want to do. I haven't had a cigarette since. I don't really have any tips for anyone other than once you find a reason important enough to quit, you'll do it, and it'll be worth it. Happy breathing everyone!

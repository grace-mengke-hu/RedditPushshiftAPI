Day 28!!!!

I'm on day 28 of my lifestyle change.  Asit was an unintentional cold turkey quit, I have allowed myself a smoke on three occasions. I don't feel like a cheater for that, in fact I feel more successful. Anytime I'm told I can't have something I want, I obsess over it. A little reverse psychology....I've told myself that if I want or "need" to smoke when I'm drinking, as long as I don't buy a pack, I'm fine. The results are amazing!!  I also have listened to an hypnosis app that I'm thinking really sealed the deal for me. I'm just so thankful that half of my life I'm finally free from that disgusting habit!

I need a fucking pep talk right now

Started watching Stranger Things s03 e01. Not only it sucked, but since this show got me into smoking this one craving is so god damn intense. It's been 4 days without a cigarette, I can do a fifth, can't I? Nicotine is the worst addiction because it rules over me. Alcohol is bad for me but at least it's me who decides when to drink. Many drugs I've done in the past are bad but it was me who decided to do them. Nicotine is the worst fucking offender of them all, because it's not me who wants more of it. It's the fucking addiction. I need to resist this god damn shit yes? But it's so hard, how do you guys manage it for such a long time???

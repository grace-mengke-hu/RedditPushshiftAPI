Just smoked after 2 months quit. Not worth it.

I decided to smoke because for once the family was gone and I had some scotch to myself and it was just like old times.  I always feel like I want a cigarette way after I've quit.  Now I'm coughing my brains out in bed and feeling sick, and it's not worth it.  It's a battle every day, but always remember, once you get that smoke you think you want so bad, you just feel like shit afterwards.

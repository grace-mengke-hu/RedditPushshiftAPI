11 days done and dusted. my workout vitals keep increasing! #happydays

ok guys, kept the whole non-smoking thing for myself so far - this is actually my first post since I stopped 11 days ago.
I really don't know why I was smoking all those years in the first place, as I am in love with sports and I work out quite a lot, mostly cardio to be fit for my motorcycle racing passion. guess its the generation I grew up with, where it was cool to run around with those cancer sticks in your mouth.
anyways, my first daughter was born recently and my wife being a non-smoker her entire life, I decided to go cold turkey.
wasn't easy the first couple of days, but I kept compensating the cravings with lots of sports, which really worked.
I always believed I was really fit, but since I stopped my vitals are going through the roof.
Resting heartbeat dropped from 44 down to 41 by now, I can sustain high intensity, tempo+ training for a lot longer now, pushing on 90% of max heartrate (quite) comfortably, etc.
I always neglected the fact that I am a smoker when being challenged by my sport friends, as I kept telling myself that I am fitter than most of them - but now I reached another level already and that's just the beginning.
long story short - for all of you who haven't stopped yet, do it NOW. its AMAZING!! 
cant wait for the race season to commence, wondering whether this whole non smoking thingie helps me to improve my PB laptimings.

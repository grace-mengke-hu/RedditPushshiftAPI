26 M with ADHD/GAD looking for pointers (serious)

Over the weekend, my mom was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and I want her to know I'm staying strong with her. Besides cold turkey, which I'm doing, does anyone have any pointers to help cope with the stress/anxiety that accompanies quitting? I've tried before and caved and this is going to be my final time in trying to quit this terrible habit.

I've been smoking a pack of American Spirit (yellows) everyday for 6 years now. I made the decision to quit smoking yesterday as I ran out and don't want to buy them anymore. I workout everyday and take prescribed ADHD medication to manage my ADHD/GAD (general anxiety disorder), so I'm trying to use the combination of exercise/safe mental practices to alleviate the oncoming storm. Thank you to anyone who may have read this.

Quit and relapsed ready to quit again

I started smoking black and molds my junior year, then on my 18th birthday I bought a juul I used that regularly until January when I threw it out and quit cold turkey. I relapsed around April and ever since have been saying “one more pack of pods then I’m done” I’m ready to quit again only issue is none of my friends know I’ve picked it back up. I also work a very stressful job and am worried that’s gonna drive me back to it. Any advice/tips would be greatly appreciated, just felt if I could write this down it could help make it true.

2171 days.....now at 1

I quit smoking 6 years ago.  In that time I met and married someone who smoked.  I would have one of her cigarettes from time to time.  That moved to having a couple at a time, but not every day.  Then last year it went to a cigarette every day, but only 1 or 2.  This past winter it went up to 5 a day, and before I knew it, I was back at half a pack a day.  

Today that stops.  This subreddit was a huge help to get me to quit the first time, so im back, even though I hoped I never would need to come back.  Seeing my badge of 2171 makes me incredibly sad that I started back up again.  I have reset it back to 1. 

Of course work is the most stressful day in ages, why wouldnt it be?  I want a cigarette so bad, but im not gonna cave. I've quit before, and I will do it again.

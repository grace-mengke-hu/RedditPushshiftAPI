Suddenly Around Smokers

 I quit 415 days ago after 33 years of heavy smoking.

During my quitting time, I pretty much stayed by myself. I was rarely around anyone and even more rarely around smokers.

 I recently started school and suddenly found myself surrounded by smokers.

 Proudly, I can honestly say, I haven't been tempted. I've been offered a cigarette by a couple people and I simply tell them I quit.

 I can socialize with  people without feeling the urge for a smoke.

 Now that I realize it, it feels damn good.

Quitting and alcohol - 88 hours

I'm still going strong! I have really to thank this sub. Everytime I'm getting craves I visit and read someone story and that keeps me running.

Guys, the moment of truth has arrived. Today, in about 15 or 16 hours, I'll be probably drunk - celebrating my bday. Any tips in how to drink alcohol and keep going?

Thanks!

Fun facts about cotinine!

Yes, cotinine. Another reason to quit smoking.

It's a substance nicotine metabolizes into, and is one of the substances tested for if you take a medical for life insurance.

It can also hang around your system a bit longer than nicotine, and can be found in your hair, urine and blood.

I only mention this because I'm moving towards getting LI, and wanted to know what they look for in terms of smoking history. Obviously they either won't insure you or will insure you at a very high rate if you smoke. A pretty standard question is whether or not you've used tobacco in the last year, which led me to wonder if some chemical in tobacco sat in your system that long.

Although it looks as though cotinine is out of your system within a few weeks, it's always good to give that sort of thing a buffer. I'm going to wait until I've been a non-smoker for 12 months before applying, just so I can buy LI with a clear conscience.

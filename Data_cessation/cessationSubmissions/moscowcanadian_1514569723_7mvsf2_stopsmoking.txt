Had a big test last night... stayed strong.

Went out last night with some friends, there was alcohol and my best friend who got into smoking well after I did was offering me cigarettes. I politely declined and he gave me some shit but was quite supportive overall! A reminder to all of you to not to let other people influence you, and you can set a good example for your friends and family by staying strong!

Looking Forward to Actually Paying Monthly Bills

Working on day 12 as a non-smoker! This morning on my drive into work, I was thinking about my monthly budget and paying bills this weekend as I get paid tomorrow. I giggled when I realized that I don't need to set aside money in my budget to make sure I have enough money to buy cigarettes to get me thru two weeks until my next check! Now that's exciting!! I have decided to take the same dollar amount and pay extra on a credit card and put in a little into my savings account. 

When I made up my mind to quit, I did think about the savings. But to actually put it into practice is a far better feeling of accomplishment than I could ever imagine! 

And that's my 2 cents worth for the day...well, actually it's worth more than 2 cents now! (I can afford to give a little more!)

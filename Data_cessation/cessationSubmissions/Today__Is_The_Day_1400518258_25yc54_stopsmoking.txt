Shortness of breath at random intervals

So it will be 2 weeks at 9:00pm tonight and I'm getting a little concerned.  For some reason, I keep finding myself trying to catch my breath at random intervals throughout the day.  

On the other end though, my energy levels are through the roof and I have been running 2 miles/day without getting tired or losing my breath.

Has anybody else experienced this?  FYI, I'm 26 and have been a 1/4 to 1/2 pack a day smoker for the last 7 years.

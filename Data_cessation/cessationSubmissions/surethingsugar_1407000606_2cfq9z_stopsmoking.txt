21 years later.. I QUIT! Come do a happy dance with me!

I honestly didn't want to! I really enjoyed smoking (regardless of what Alan Carr says). BUT I'm poor and and I'm a parent.


How? I got an evod e-cigarette starter kit. It was about $80 in total (the kit which has two cigarettes, chargers, extra coils) and I got three different e-liquids, plus shipping. I figure I smoked $80 worth of cigarettes in about 10 days so it will be paid for pretty quickly.
The day it arrived I cleaned out my ashtray and put it far away. I still have a few cigarettes left but I haven't even touched them. 


Anyway.. I've been a closet smoker for the past 15? years or so. I have *no one* to share this with! I am super duper proud of myself, I feel great, I smell great!! Thanks for listening!

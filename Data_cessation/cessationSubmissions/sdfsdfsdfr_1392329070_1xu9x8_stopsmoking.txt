How do I quit smoking?

I know it's easy for someone to walk up and say to me ''just quit''. But the thing is, is that I went smoke free for a year. I feel that if I quit again now, I will have to wait another year to be smoke free. I don't have the patience. And I just keep on regressing back to that year.
Yes it was a good achievement to go a year without smoking but I feel that I ruined it by starting again. It has only been a couple of months since I have started again.

If you say to me, quit and then every month will get stronger. Then I will think yes, you are right, but it's not the cravings that concern me. I can deal with the cravings. I just can't deal with the fact that I would feel like a failure even after 6 months of giving up, because I would always be consciously comparing it to the year I gave up in.

To some people it feels like I am making excuses. To some people it may seem like I just need to take the plunge. But I can't take the plunge unless I get everything into perspective and acquire stronger coping mechanisms. Like compensate once I quit and go the extra mile in something else. I really don't know.

I am male. I am 12 stone 3, and I am 6 foot 1. I want to lose a pound. I weight myself every thursday. I want to lose a pound and then quit smoking. Because I can't do both at the same time. I appreciate some people gain weight after smoking, but I will still be more determined to keep the weight off once I quit. And it will be just focusing on one thing.

I really hope you understand what I mean. And I really hope you can see my perspective and offer me outside the box advice. Because at the moment. Nothing anyone has said has given me the drive, the determination. I know that has to come from myself. But I need a push in the right direction.

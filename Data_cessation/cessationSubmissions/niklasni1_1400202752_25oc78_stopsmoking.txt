Calm and happy..

Today was a good day. I've not had a cigarette since last tuesday morning. I'm glad I finally worked up the courage to do this again, glad that I'm already feeling healthier, glad that I can start my first job (office work) on monday without have to plan cigarette breaks and worry that I stink like an ash tray, and especially glad that I know the worst is now over... now it's just hanging in there a day at a time, reminding myself how lucky I am to be in charge of what I do when I wake up and to be able to sit inside for eight hours if I need to without making excuses... all that stuff.

The posts here and the stupid badge has really helped me a lot. Thanks for it all.

Kicking off from ground zero.

Hey dudes. Not much to say on this, just that I'd fed up with smoking. The price, the smell, the habit that I really don't want to keep going. A few days here and a few days there isn't turning into anything sustained so I figured a badge might help (helped me kick my boozing which was a much, much bigger issue for me). 

Well. Onwards into the breach. I shall be Tetchyfox and learn to taste food again.

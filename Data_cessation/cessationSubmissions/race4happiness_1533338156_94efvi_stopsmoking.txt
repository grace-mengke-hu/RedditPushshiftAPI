Hi, I need help, I picked up smoking again. I have a history of picking up smoking again after a couple of years after I quit.

I quit in February with the help of vaping and started again a week ago, three cigarettes a day now. The problem is that I live with a heavy smoker so getting reed of cigarettes not an option.
How can I control the impulses when they happen? I have so many reasons not to smoke but it doesn't help. :(
I just don't know what to do.

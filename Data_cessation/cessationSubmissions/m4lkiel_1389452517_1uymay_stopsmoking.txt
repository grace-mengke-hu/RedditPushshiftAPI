Of old friends, ones that remind you of who you used to be..

I haven't smoked in ten months and truly intended to quit - for life! When I met up with an old friend yesterday, we haven't spoken to each other in ages, and he seemed a little depressed. He offered me his cigarette even after I told him that I hadn't smoked in a while. I kinda felt bad for him so I had 2 little puffs. Interestingly, I found that I actually didn't enjoy it at all. I didn't feel the rush, or satisfying urge, I just felt 'dirty' for not being strong enough to reject him. It's okay, I didn't relapse or go buy a pack after that, just thought that I would share this story. Is it justified to leave old friends, especially if you know that they will drag you back to your old habits/ not support your new-found, healthy lifestyle?

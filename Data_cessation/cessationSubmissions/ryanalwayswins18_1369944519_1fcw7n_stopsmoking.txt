2 Weeks in

I haven't smoked a single puff of a cigarette in 14 days today. It had been getting easier, but today was hell. Everywhere I turned there was something there that made me want another cigarette. It's so hard to resist the urges sometimes! But I did stay strong, and I do feel better about myself for it, though I'm ready to not have such strong cravings. Any help and support is greatly appreciated

A little help?

Hey, so today I've decided to quit, for good. I can't stand it anymore and I really do need to quit. Not only do I smoke cigarettes but also cannabis so I know this is going to be a hard journey and I really am just looking for support. If anyone would like to message me or comment that be great, I have a feeling it's going be a rough night :/

Small Victories

2 weeks quit today. It hasn't been fun but today was the first day the cravings weren't screaming but rather, talking at a normal level.

Anyway, as I sat on my couch and felt a craving come on, I heard the first June bug of the season hit my window. And guess what? I don't HAVE to go out there by them because I don't smoke anymore!! Might seem stupid,  but this is the first quit moment I've been genuinely happy about. 

So glad I found this sub. Thanks everyone.

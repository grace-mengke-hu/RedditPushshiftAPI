Day 17 and I set an example for myself today

I love this forum. It helps me stay strong and smoke free. This is not my first post and I thank all the support I got on my previous ones.

Today is day 17 and I tested myself rather awkwardy.
I bought a pack. I lit one and smelled it. Kinda liked it a bit. Then put it off and threw it. Then took out the remaining 19. I crushed em one by one before I flushed em.

I did all this to remind myself later that there was a day when I could've easily relapsed, but the moral of the story is that I didn't, that these cigarettes don't control me anymore, I CONTROL THEM!!.

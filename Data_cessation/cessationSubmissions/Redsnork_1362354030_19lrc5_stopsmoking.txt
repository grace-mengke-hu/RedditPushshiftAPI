About one month smoke free, having trouble sleeping.

I have quit smoking, and up until now I havent really had a problem. But recently I've had strong cravings for a ciggarette. It's gotten to the point where I have difficulty sleeping without lying awake, hankering for a smoke. I have a wonderful friend that is helping motivate me, but my physical symptoms suck! Any other former smokers have this problem? What can I do?

90 Days Today, saving $$ on health insurance.

Celebrating 90 days cigarette and nicotine free today! I feel freaking fantastic.

Since I'm a state employee, today I get to go online and certify myself as a NON-SMOKER and save myself about $30/mo on health insurance.

I did it the [EasyWay](http://allencarr.com/), and I even had to put my beloved 12-y/o yellow lab down last week, and believe me it was a difficult drive back home from the vet. But I made it. "Why make a bad day even worse" was my psychology.

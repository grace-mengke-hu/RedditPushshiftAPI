My biggest triggers since I quit.

1. Week one: Wife had a miscarriage.
2. Week two: I got fired with a month notice. 
3. Week three: I fought with my brother
4. Week four: Being fired and packing my stuff
5. Week five: Interview for a new job. (scary as hell)


These were the bigger triggers, I occasionally run into people smoking, I occasionally have to deal with an idiot who triggers my inner trigger to smoke. Sometimes I get very sad about losing my unborn baby, which is really emotionally straining. I was super excited. 

Every being in me tells me to smoke, every cell in me thinks I deserve it. But I made a promise to myself, and I respect myself that much to keep that promise to myself. 

Ignore all the grammar and spelling mistakes, if I go back to editing this I'll just delete the whole thing. 

**Stay positive**

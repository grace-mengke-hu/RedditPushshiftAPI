Week one

This was easier than I thought. As explained in my first post I had a pretty hard time the 2nd or 3rd day. 
I was pretty worried about the night out, with smoker friends around or so. 
And wasn't that bad. 
The cravings weren't at theses moments but more when I was alone or doing nothing. The moment that you are waiting for something or someone. 
When theses happened I drank a lot of water, eat a gum or put something in my mouth so my mind stop thinking about the smoking and focus on something else. Whatever else.

I hope I'll get through the weeks as easily as this one.

Today is Day 9 of no smoking.

Just found this sub and figured I'd subscribe, post, and badge up as another way of keeping myself accountable.  

This is my fourth (or 5th, I really am unsure) attempt to quit in the past 4 years.  

Last year I made it 5 days (while on vacation).  

I've found that it's really hard to concentrate when cravings hit (and I'm still having some pretty intense ones).   Any tips?

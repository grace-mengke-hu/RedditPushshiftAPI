I am Confident Now, More than Ever!

Today marks the first day... Well maybe my 10th 'first day' of quitting tobacco altogether. But this time I feel my resolve to be stronger than ever! Although the challenges are tougher. I've been an on/off smoker for a little over a year now with my longest being a couple months without smoking. But this was replaced with dip to satisfy that nicotine addiction I've had. Recently, I've been doing both (not at the same time but alternating based on setting/mood). The longest I've gone without tobacco was 3-5 days which is where I've hit my wall when trying to quit with previous attempts. My health notably declined further (subjectively), the shortness of breath (dyspnea) being the most despairing of my desired continuous use. 

My biggest challenge is the fact that I work in a high intensity / fast pace environment where about 80% of the other workers use some form of tobacco as well. 

This time I've finally decided to give it my all as I've used apps, told those close to me that I am much more serious about it, and I'm also trying this group.

It's pretty inspiring to see how much so many of you have accomplished and this definitely boosts my morale. You're all probably wondering how long this confidence will last. I give it 2 days lol. This time just feels different to me. Thank you all for your support!

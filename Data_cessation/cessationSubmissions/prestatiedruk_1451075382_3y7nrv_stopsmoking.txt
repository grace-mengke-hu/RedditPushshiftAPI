Longing for a fag

Quit a while ago, right now I want nothing more than a smoke. I miss some mates I met during my last year in Ireland (that's why I was thinking of a *fag* instead of a smoke), right now I'm in a country where I don't have many friends, quite far away from home. 

It's Christmas, nothing I'd usually give much about, but I've spent the last 4 years abroad and Christmas always meant I'd meet my family. 

I barely avoided a fight with my drunk SO, who went to bed. Now I'm in the living room, her roommate and his guest just left to go I don't know where and I just want a fucking cigarette. They're lying on the table next to me.

I probably won't take one, I know that I'd feel unhappy tomorrow. But I'm already unhappy right now, so it's double hard to resist. 

Thanks for reading the whole thing. If you did, maybe leave a short comment. I'd appreciate it!

Ladies and Gentlemen..

This is it! I'm a human being again! I quit smoking! 30 days without a cigarette and it feels pretty fine. My sex drive has returned with a fiery passion, food tastes amazing, and I feel more outgoing! On top of all that, I have been able to buy myself 3 new video games this month with the money I have saved, and I have been able to afford actual lunches, and not some nonsense raman noodle crap everyday.

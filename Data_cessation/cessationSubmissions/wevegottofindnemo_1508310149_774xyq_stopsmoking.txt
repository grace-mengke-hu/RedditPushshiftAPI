What are your smoking triggers and what helps you get past them?

I have always used smoking as my emotional crutch. I can manage the nicotine withdrawals and am doing better at fighting through the "I need a cigarette because I'm on the phone/ just ate/ bored/ etc" cravings. Still avoiding drinking/ being around smoking since it's still new and I have a bigger quit concern.

My giant hurdle is moments of extreme stress, frustration, or anger. I caved today on day 8 because of one of those instances where I was just at my limit. I threw the pack away and recommitted to the quit, but of course I'm still worried - after all, life isn't free of stresses or anger. I know smoking causes stress rather than relieves it, but at this point I've leaned on the cigarette crutch for so long that i don't know how to let it drop.

How do you get past those trigger moments, whatever yours may be?

Advice needed ...

As background I smoked about 20 a day for 2 and a half years whilst at university. Prior to that I struggled with Anxiety and depression and had been on various antidepressants, none of which helped. I drank excessively as well, and went to AA meetings for a while but decided it wasn't for me. 

I've just finished my degree and I've been 'not smoking' since December 2018.  I've had less than 10 cigarettes in that time and I've been using nicotine nasal spray which is a lifesaver. But I'm really struggling to stop using the nasal spray. Even though the nicotine is only equivalent to about a cigarette and a half a day I just can't seem to stop. It costs more than smoking and I'm getting myself into debt over it because I get a few days into withdrawal and I can't stop crying and I feel an overwhelming urge to either smoke or use the nasal spray. Most of the time I pick the nasal spray, but I can't afford to keep doing that. 

I can't shift the feeling that I need something to be able to cope. I've been drinking more recently as well and I'm worried that if I come off the nasal spray then I'll go back to drinking excessively instead. 

Has anyone experienced anything like this? I could really do with some advice please.

The weirdness continues....

Well here we are at day nine. It has been a bizarre journey so far, please allow me to explain. 

The first thing that I was not expecting was a short but really intense bout with diarrhea. The only thing had changed was that I quit smoking , so there ya go.

The second thing was the weird dreams where I was smoking in them. I cannot recall ever having a dream featuring me smoking before. I woke up feeling guilty like I blew my quit. Crazy. 

The third thing is how much tougher quitting this time was as compared to my previous attempt. I went 32 days that time.  (Drinking broke me) Initially my withdrawal symptoms were not as severe as this time. This go around they were so bad I DO NOT want to go through them again! ( Great Motivator)

Since I fell prey to drinking the last time, I am very mindful of it now and realize that if anything is going to do me in, drinking is it.  I read that you should break that association sooner rather than later, so yesterday I went and bought a six of those little “pony” beers and drank them paying special attention to the crave to smoke. 
I craved, I acknowledged it as psychological, let it pass and had another beer.  By the end of the six pack I felt I was getting a good handle on it. I didn’t smoke. 

Reading this sub has helped me quite a bit. Wish you all the best of luck on your quit. Thank you.

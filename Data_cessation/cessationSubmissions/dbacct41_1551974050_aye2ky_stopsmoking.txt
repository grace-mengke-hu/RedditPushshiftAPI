Quit Day 22 Mission

I figure this is the best place for me to post the SmokeFree day 22 mission.

I commit to myself and all of you that I will never have even a single puff of a cigarette again, no matter what. I know that even a single puff is a slippery slope that just ends with me smoking again.

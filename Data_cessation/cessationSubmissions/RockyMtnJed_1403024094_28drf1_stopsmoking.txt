About 3 days in, cold turkey, and just have some questions about help and tips

Starting last night I started to have a ferocious appetite. It makes sense that I would, but does anyone have any foods to eat that are filling that are nutritious? Also my sleep is starting to get a little fucked up. I am tired and need to sleep more, but I cannot stay asleep, I keep waking up and passing out. Any sleep hygiene tips?

A victory for me! Share your own! Let's all be proud of ourselves today!!

My best friend came home for a visit and we got wine drunk together. Like very drunk. And she was smoking and I had a couple drags of her cigarette because it just smelled so good!! But it didn't feel or taste like I had remembered it. It was super strange. Honestly, I didn't like it and I didn't feel like I needed it. It didn't give me any sort of relief at all. The best part is that it's been almost a week and I haven't had ANY cravings since. It was like affirmation that I'm not a smoker anymore. It feels awesome! Yesterday I sat for a 5 hour outline for a back tattoo and I didn't even feel a craving or think about a cigarette even when a few other people were constantly pausing their tattoo and going out for a cig.

My best friend told me that I was her inspiration to quit. I'm so proud of her and myself :))))

Third day without smoking!

Three days ago I decided that it was enough. Been smoking for the last 6 years and I couldn't stop. Monday night I decided to finally quit after talking to my fianc√©e. The weird thing is that I have found it easy, and it's kind of scary.

I also told all my coworkers and friends to kick the crap out of me if they even saw me holding a lighter, they happily obliged.

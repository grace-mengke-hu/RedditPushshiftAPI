Depressions a bic-tch, how does I do this??

Ooooowwie Rick, so I've been trying to quit smoking off and on for the last 2 years to no avail. Part of what makes it so difficult is that I have major depression and anxiety so obviously part of why I smoke is to self medicate those feelings away. It kind of works, but boy did I choose a toxic medicine...

At some point when my body is feeling run down and I get fed up with this nonsense I'm fully aware I'm putting myself through, I get all amped up and throw away all my cigs, ecigs (as they always lead back to cigs for me) lighters, etc.. And tell myself I'm done. And I quit! For anywhere from 10-72 hours, until withdrawal starts kicking in (I'm aware this is mostly psychological, but that's the problem) and along with it a slightly amplified version of my already not great mental health issues. 

I always bargain with myself and say I'm not ready, maybe once I'm more mentally stable, what good is quitting if I go off the deep end and hurt myself (god forbid I hurt myself, I'll solve it by inhaling poison!), blah blah blah... But I'm certain part of my mental health issues are due to the addiction and physical problems smoking brings. And before anyone goes there, yes I'm getting help for my issues no I'm not gonna jump off a bridge. 

Just wondering if anyone can relate and maybe has some tips to push past these moments of weakness where life seems too bleak to not be breathing poison? Desperately want freedom from this shit but I get so lost and short sighted when I rip this bandaid off my psyche. Sorry for the wall of text, thanks for reading my rant if you made it this far!

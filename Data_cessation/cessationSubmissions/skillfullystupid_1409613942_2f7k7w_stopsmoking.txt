stopped smoking this morning

My GF broke up with me yesterday due to me not quitting smoking. I quit for about 2 months but went back when I was drinking. I want to get her back and looking for some ideas on ways I can show her I'm really serious about quitting this time. Any help is appreciated, what worked for some of you guys/ what have you heard is the best is really what I'm asking

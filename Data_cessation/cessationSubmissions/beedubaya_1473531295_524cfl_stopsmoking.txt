How to not miss smoking?

I am 2 months quit. I don't have the physical cravings anymore that I had during my first six weeks.  Situations where I feel that "I have to have a cigarette" have become rare.  However, I still miss smoking.  Thing is, I had a two year quit under my belt and then relapsed in the fall of 2015 for the same reason.  I missed smoking.  Every time I would see somebody smoking on TV or read about it or any time I listen to old music the mentions cigarettes, I miss it and I want one.  Seasonal changes are also big time triggers.  The truth of the matter is that there is nothing else quite like a cigarette, and it's something I am going to have to learn to live without, but how do I not miss it?  Smoking was always something I really enjoyed.  I know the health risks and the social stigma, but there is also a social benefit to it as well.  What do you do to make yourself not miss the cigarette?

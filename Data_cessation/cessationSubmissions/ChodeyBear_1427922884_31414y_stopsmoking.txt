Can someone please tell me why Reddit keeps trying to make me feel seasick today?

Obviously I know it's April fools day.

I've seen mention of rickrolling but from what I can see that's linking to Rick Astley's 'never gonna give you up'

So why the hell, when I click some things, is the page swaying about! Bleurghhhhh

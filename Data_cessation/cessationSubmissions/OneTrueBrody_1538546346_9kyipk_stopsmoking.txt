I’m Done.

No “1 upvote=1 day I don’t smoke”. No “only quitting for a bit”. No “only smoking when I drink”. I’m done.

I’ve only been smoking for two years, I’m 21, so I’m not two concerned for my long term health going forward. But I know that if I keep smoking, it’ll be come an issue. Even now I’ve been coughing and have a slight lump in my throat, but I’ve also had cold symptoms so it’s probably that. But I’m a paranoid dude in general, so my mind automatically thinks “this is cancer, and I’m going to have to have my voice box removed and have a stoma for the rest of my life”.

No more of that. I bought a juul today, smoked my last cigarette at about 2:30pm. I’m done.

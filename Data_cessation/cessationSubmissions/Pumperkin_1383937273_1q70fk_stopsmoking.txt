Down at the corner store

I stopped over at my usual cigarette purchase point on my lunch break today.  I was picking up some junk food and gum to celebrate a few days being clean.  The cashier asked me where I have been.  I happily informed her that I hadn't been around lately because I quit smoking.  We high-fived, confetti fell from the ceiling, and a band struck up out of nowhere.  OK, I made up at least part of that.  Despite the lost business, she was genuinely happy for me and I am happy for myself.  I was worried about my troll brain messing with me today.  I have enough practice with quitting all week  and failing on the weekend not to fall for it anymore.  It's tried a few times already today and almost had me convinced I would be smoking all weekend, to restart on Monday.  My asshole troll brain can eat shit, and will have to be satisfied with gum and Fritos.

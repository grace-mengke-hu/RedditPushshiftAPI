Quick urges that lead to nothing

I've been lurking a while around here and I mainly see success stories.

My problem is that I get an urge to light one up and then as soon as I take 3 or so puffs I just get disgusted and throw it out after less than half the cig. But, this urge comes up frequently (almost 10 or more times a day).

Has anyone faced this kind of problem? If so, how did you deal with it?

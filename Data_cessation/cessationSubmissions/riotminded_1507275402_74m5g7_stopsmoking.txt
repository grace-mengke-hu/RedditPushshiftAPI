The stupidest thing I have ever done!

I was smoke free for a year and eight months after smoking for 10 years straight. A couple of months back I caved and had one cigarette! Now I am at five a day and I am finding it way more difficult to quit  than the first time. 

To all of you, whether you quit last week or last year or last decade, do not go back. Do not fool yourself into thinking one cigarette won't make a difference. It takes exactly one cigarette to relapse after a year and eight months! One cigarette to undo all the progress.

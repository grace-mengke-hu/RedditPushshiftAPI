Non-nicotine lozenges?

I'm happily and properly quit, though I'm still using 5-8 2mg Nicorette lozenges daily.  I started with 4mg Costco ones, and when I got a deal on the name-brand I changed over -- they're really quite enjoyable.

So now I'd like to get nicotine out of my system entirely...does anyone have suggestions for mint lozenges that are any good?  Altoids are disappointingly small and chalky.

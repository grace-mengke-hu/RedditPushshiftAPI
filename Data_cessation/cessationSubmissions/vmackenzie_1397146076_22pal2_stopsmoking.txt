Does the patch make anyone else violently sick?

23/f I put a step 2 patch on because I smoke 7 cigarettes a day. I went downstairs, ate my breakfast, and made a pit stop to work. On my way to school I threw up my whole breakfast to bike. I took off the patch since I didn't feel nauseated until after putting it on. 

Do I go to step 1? Has this happened to anybody else? What do I do? 

Thanks.

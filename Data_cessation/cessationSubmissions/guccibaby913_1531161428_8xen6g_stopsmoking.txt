I thought it got easier?

I've quit/been quitting for 57 days. Within this timeframe I've smoked about 15 cigarettes. I still strongly crave at the very least once a day, more and stronger cravings in a bout of stress or drinking. 

Why is the hold still so strong? If I've bummed one off a friend I'm not the biggest fan, but as soon as I smoke my brand it's like a best friend that never left. What gives?

Additional info: 26 years old, smoker for 10 years at around half a pack a day when I quit.

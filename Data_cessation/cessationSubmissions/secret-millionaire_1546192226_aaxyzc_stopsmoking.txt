Need to quit and have been trying for years with varying levels of success. What always brings me back is the fact all my friends smoke

So I’ve been smoking on and off since I was 17. I’ve just turned 25 and absolutely hate smoking! But I do it anyways. Every single cigarette I smoke I hate and tell my self I need to quit. 


I very rarely actually buy cigarettes myself, and I know if I was isolated from everyone for a few months I could quit easily. But I see my friends almost every day and they always offer me cigarettes. I’ve tried talking to them about it and asking not to offer, but if they don’t offer I always end up seeing them smoking and ask for one which just restarts the cycle. 

It’s frustrating! As dickish as it is I sometimes even ask to hang out with a friend I know will offer me a cig sometimes if I feel like smoking. 

I really need to quit, anyone have any advice for how to break my fucked up addiction. Thanks in advance

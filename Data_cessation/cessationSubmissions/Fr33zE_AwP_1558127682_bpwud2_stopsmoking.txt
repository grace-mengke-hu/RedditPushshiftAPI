Update #1 - May 16 quit date.

It’s been 40 hours since I quit the craving episodes feel like hours. My will power is the only thing getting me through this. Not sure if it’s placebo or not but I feel much more energetic already. 

Also hella cranky. The smallest of things is setting off my rage. I’m usually not short tempered but that how I feel right now.

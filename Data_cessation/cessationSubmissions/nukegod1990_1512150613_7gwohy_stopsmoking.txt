Two Weeks!! That stuff is bad news for your heart!

Smoked on and off for ten years, two weeks ago I decided enough is enough. 

The craziest part is tracking my resting heart rate with my fitbit. 74 bpm when I was a smoker, down to 62 with just 2 weeks of not smoking and running! I regret not measuring my blood pressure.
 
If I can do it anyone can! Get out there and get your heart back into shape!

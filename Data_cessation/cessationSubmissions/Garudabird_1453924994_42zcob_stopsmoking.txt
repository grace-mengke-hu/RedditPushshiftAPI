The hidden cost of smoking

So I won't bore you all with the details but in brief, I stopped for about 5 months and then had 'just one' which we all know doesn't exist. So I've been smoking again for about a month. This evening however has been a string of minor disasters which ended in a large burn hole in my sofa! I take it as a sign that this is the time to stop again, knowing that any money saved now has to be spent on reupholstering that cushion cover so I can still get my deposit back! And so fellow quitters, I hope you all have great plans for your new found wealth and I look forward to being able to spend it on something a bit more worthwhile!

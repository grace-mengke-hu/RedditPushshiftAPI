24 hours down.

A lifetime to go.

The first 24 weren't too bad. Tried keeping busy, relaxing too much brought around too many cravings.

I've seen people here talk about drinking lots of water...does that help?

I guess my main concern is breaking the habit so that I can break the addiction. I have very common times that I smoke, like while driving to work, so I know those will be tough to get through. I'll be going on vacation on the 14th for a week, so that'll be good for breaking away from the
norms.

Hope everyone is having a good nicotine free day :]

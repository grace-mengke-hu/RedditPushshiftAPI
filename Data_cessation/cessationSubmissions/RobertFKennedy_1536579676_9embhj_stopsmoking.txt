Any relation between chantix/champix and low testosterone?

Been on chantix for 5 weeks, bloodwork came in and showed low test. Unfortunately, never had a baseline before chantix. So I’m reaching out to see if anyone saw any correlation. Yes I’m aware that while on that drug, low libido occurs but I’m talking more specifically about testosterone levels

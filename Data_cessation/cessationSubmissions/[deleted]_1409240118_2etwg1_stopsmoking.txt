Pointless Daily Update, Apparently

So I've made it to day 121, which is 1 day better than my previous attempt at not smoking a couple of years ago.

Last night my fiancee said it would probably be best if our eldest cat was put to sleep this coming Saturday (unless something amazing happens and he gets better). I fell apart and had a horrible night. Didn't sleep much... and when I did, I had a dream that 2 of our other cats died. And now I'm at work and still crying off and on and having to explain to people on the phone why my voice is cracking.

I find it pretty impressive that it hasn't even occured to me to smoke. For almost 17 years, that would have been my immediate reaction to... anything really. Good, bad, catastrophic, meaningless.

Of course I think of smoking... I mean I'm on this subreddit talking about it... but not in a "Oh my god, I think I'm going to smoke. Off to the store!" kind of way. More just acknowledging that I don't need that anymore. 

Me smoking won't make my cat healthy and young. Smoking fixes nothing... ever. It only ever ruins things.

Thanks for reading my ramblings.

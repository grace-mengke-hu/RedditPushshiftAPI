I will be a non-smoker in less than a week and I recently started treatment for ADHD. These past few weeks have been a bit of a revelation. Now I will finally see I'm capable of change, but I already believe it.

Here's what I wrote myself last night before I went to bed. Getting words on paper is a big deal for me, and will be important moving forward I believe:

Ok, a week from today, at this time, you will be wrapping up your first 24 hours as a non-smoker. More likely, you will have probably passed that point a little bit ago.

You need to know this: There are no criteria. If you decided to go with the gum or patch ended your last cigarette at 12:04 am Monday thereby making it not count or didn't get a chance to clean the butts out of the truck or whatever other bogus reason you can think of when your mind is doing what it does - it doesn't matter. You have closed out a day whether it was good, bad, or awesome as a non-smoker.. This is your first day (*a full day!*) in over six years. It doesn't get much more novel than that for my ADHD brain. The only criteria for being a non-smoker is not taking a drag of a cigarette. So don't take a drag of a cigarette tomorrow.

>Go on about your business and awesome, new, exciting things will happen in your body, your finances, and your self-esteem without you doing anything. Anticipate, wait for, and look for those things as they happen.


Can't wait to get my badge.

I now consider myself to be a non-smoker again

During the first weeks and months I enjoyed having someone smoke around me so I could smell it. Now, I still do have some minor cravings now and then, but I am disgusted if someone smokes near me. It worsens the air so incredibly much and I cant stand it. I no longer feel like a quitter, but like a non-smoker.

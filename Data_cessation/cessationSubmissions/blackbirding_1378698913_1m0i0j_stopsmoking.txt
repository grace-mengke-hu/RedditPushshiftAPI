Looking for some advice on smoking escapism

I've read the book and set a quit date, and am rereading it.  I've come to realize that the majority of my smoking is a "break" or escape from my life.  I smoke on my porch, and its truly one of the few times in the day where I can be alone. I read, reddit, play candy crush, and enjoy my solitude. I realize after I quit I can still come out and read, but I'm worried that same pattern will set my brain up for relapse. So, I'm looking for alternative activities for when I want to be alone.  I've quit 5 times before, and one of those times I'd go shopping to get out of the house, but financially I want to save money by quitting!  I'm going to start walking while the weather cooperates, but I'd love to know what you all have done with your time spent once smoking.

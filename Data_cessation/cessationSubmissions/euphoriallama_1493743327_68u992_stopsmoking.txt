First feelings of actual gratitude for not smoking

I never thought it would happen but yesterday I found myself absentmindedly thinking that I was glad not to be a smoker anymore. I didn't have to force the thought—I just had it. It felt like that "freedom" feeling I've read so much about but not believed it'd be possible to have myself. Not saying I'm over the hump—this shit is difficult, and I'm sure that in its way it'll be difficult forever—but the days are going by more quickly now, my mind is more my own and less pirated by thoughts of cigarettes, and I'm grateful for these occasional moments of awareness that I'm not being steered by this particular vice anymore, thanks to willpower and this awesome community of folks. Keep going, y'all. Thank you for being here for one another, and for me.

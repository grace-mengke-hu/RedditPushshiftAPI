A long day but i'm making i through 

I had a long day i'm back at college and classes started on Monday and iv been stressed not only that iv just been sad and depressed all day. I'm three weeks in and i think something that has made this worse is my boyfriends roommate likes to keep telling me if i make it a year with out smoking we can be friends i don't think he understands how hard it is to quit after smoking for almost 2 years but my boyfriend really has been helping i think if he wasn't there for me it would be a lot harder to get through this I know this gets better but why does it take so long. I'm just glad i have this subreddit and people to help me through because if it wasn't for that i would still be smoking. Thank you /r/stopsmoking and thank you sweetheart

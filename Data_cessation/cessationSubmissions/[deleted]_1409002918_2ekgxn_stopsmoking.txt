Quitting through meditation

Hey folks - I used to smoke and moved to ecigs.  This became a much worse addiction since I could now have a constant flow of nicotine when I sat at my desk, drive anywhere, while gaming, and in bed (I used to only smoke outside).  

I had a friend introduce me to an app called [Headspace](http://www.headspace.com) and have been using their free 10 minute meditations to help fill the time when I get to the place where I want to get in the car, drive to 7-11 or the vape store, and pick up that sweet release of nicotine.

Has anyone experienced any level of success using meditation as a way to quit?

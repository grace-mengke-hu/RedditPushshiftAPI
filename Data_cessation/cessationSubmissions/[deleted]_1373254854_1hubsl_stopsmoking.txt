Stopped smoking today.

I'm not going to lie. It sucks. I have been a pack a day habit for a while now. Everything someone says to me makes me want to strangle them. I have very little patience for anything, and I keep clenching my jaw. Still, I can't wait for the moment I can look at a cigarette and say that I don't need it. It will be a glorious moment indeed.

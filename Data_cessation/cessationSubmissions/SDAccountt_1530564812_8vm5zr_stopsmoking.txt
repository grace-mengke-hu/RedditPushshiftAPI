Ecig/Vape

Hey all, so I'm not your typical person that's trying to quit regular cigarettes but trying to quit ecigs.

Over the past 2 years I've been buying ecigs and just using it whenever I'm alone. Really no one knows how much or often i do it, or that I do it at all... I guess I've always just thought it wasn't a permanent thing but eventually became one and I realize now how expensive this really is. Not to mention I can physically feel it in my chest after I excersize or stop long enough. I've been reading this sub and can relate to a lot of things but also can't relate to some of it. I've read how people get cravings and they only last a few minutes and to keep yourself busy. I get very exhausted mentally, feel out of it and groggy, irritable, and after a few hours find it nearly impossible not to get in my own head, but it definitely feels like the 'cravings' last much longer than a few minutes. I don't even enjoy it anymore, I just feel worse and get very anxious after doing it now, but after I stop for long enough my brain forgets all that and justifies it.

I have 1 left and I don't want to buy anymore after it. I can get through a few hours without thinking about it but after that once it's a thought it's hard for me to shake it. Just wondering if any of you have advice on this? I definitely will plan to keep reading posts here once this last one is gone. Stay strong friends.

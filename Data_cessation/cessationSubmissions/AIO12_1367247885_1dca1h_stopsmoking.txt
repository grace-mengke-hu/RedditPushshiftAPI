57 days in, had a dream.

I've seen pretty much this exact post here, so I apologize for this.

Last night I had a dream where I smoked a cig. Just grabbed one out of a pack and went outside and lit up, no decision making at all. About halfway through I realize what I'm doing, and that I just threw 57 days down the drain.

The important part for me, is that up until today I had never seen the issue of just having one smoke down the road when it's less of a challenge for me. After going through that feeling of getting this close to 2 months and have to go all the way back to the beginning made me realize that even just one further in the future would be a mistake.

Any words of encouragement? I'm back at day 1 again...

Its been 4 months... 4 MONTHS FREE. but I was offered by an old friend I saw Friday, I just couldn't bring myself to say no, so I had it and I remembered how much less angry and anxious smoking made me. Saturday morning I went out and bought a pack of Canadian classics, my old favorite. After having maybe a 3rd of the pack I saw my old motivational note I wrote myself on the wall. I'm pissed and am so close to just saying screw it and having a smoke. I've tried to quit umpteen times before and it's never worked out. Anyone got advice how to actually be able to say No?  because I can't live life bubble wrapped from cigarettes

I am a young, lucky Californian

Hi, 18 year old ex smoker here. Smoked for only two years. I started at 16 when I didn't give a flying fuck about my future in any way, and quit two months ago when I realized I would probably die a slow, painful and premature death. However, quitting is tough with the Marlboros, camels, and American Spirits staring me in the eye whenever I walk into basically any store. I think about smoking 24/7.
Fortunately, Jerry Brown signed a bill to bump up the smoking age to 21. I am temptation free for three years. I don't know any 21 year old who would buy me cigarettes. The bill goes into action on June 9th. I will not stock up before then, even though that evil voice in my head says "stock up!" One more month!

My smoker-sense is tingling... (rant)

I quit about 5 months ago, and for the first time (after the first week or so), I feel the need to light up because of stress. Here is why I'm that stressed:

After a year and half without school I started university (online classes) about a month ago and I feel like I'm late in my assignments and studies. I've submitted a few of them and I still didn't see any result I don't know how well I'm doing. And I've got this big report thing to submit next Monday which I'm really confused about. 

I also work 30 hours a week so that gives me limited time to watch classes and I can't seem to focus when I'm watching them. I try to drink coffee but it just seems to make me lose my focus even more, and obviously when I drink some in the evening I have trouble sleeping later on.

So with that in mind, I'm thinking of smoking again. It would give me the break I need to relax and refocus when my mind gets carried away. I know it's a terrible habit but the main reason why I quit was because of money problems, which I don't have anymore. 

I'm at work right now and I have a break in an hour. I have the intent of buying a pack and smoking one right there. Please convince me to not do that.

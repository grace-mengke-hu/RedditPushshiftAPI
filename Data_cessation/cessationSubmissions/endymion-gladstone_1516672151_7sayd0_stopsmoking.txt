Anyone else get “late-stage” craving?

I’m 115 days quit, and I haven’t had a craving since my first month. I almost felt that nicotine was behind me entirely. Tonight leaving work I felt that familiar tenseness behind my temples that always came with cravings. 

I’m not going to smoke. Cigs are so far out of my habit now. I am just shocked at the craving. It’s pretty strong too. Maybe it’s just the situation.  Anyone else get random pangs like this?

Day 2. Convincing myself every 2 minutes not to run to the store

Hi!!

This is my first time here because it is the first time in 5 years I have decided to go for it. 

Story:

Started smoking when I was 15 to make a boy mad. I was really smart about somethings, I see I was also really really dumb about other things. Anyways, smoked for about 4 years. I got up to almost a pack a day at my peak. Then I decided it was time to stop, and I did. I used no aids at all, just stopped. It was really difficult but I managed to make it a few months. 

Then I started working at a bar, and smoke breaks were the only breaks. So I started smoking socially again. Then that increased to just one a day. Then several a day. Then almost to half a pack a day again. So about a year ago I tried to quit again. I started using that spray stuff.

It works well enough, I don't smoke cigarettes anymore. But I use that thing like every 30 minutes and it's ridiculous. So it's time to get rid of the rest of the addiction. I'm going cold turkey again. 

It's already impossible. I want to run to the store every 2 minutes. I couldn't stay asleep longer than an hour last night. This is particularly bad as I've also been sick lately, and really exhausted. It only feels worse now. 

I also don't really believe in myself. So I guess I'm here to see what everyone has to say about their journeys and mine in case something helps. My most pressing questions are:

"How long will it be hard to sleep?"

"How do I get the thought of nicotine out of the back of my head?" 

So hello!

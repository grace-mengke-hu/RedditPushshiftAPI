4 days in, I can't focus on anything. I'm trying.

First working day of the week (Sunday in Arab country is a working day) and I've got a list of things to do in the office.   Problem is, four days into my quitting, and I have had this constant tension under my skin, in may face under my eyes and in my chest absolutely screaming for a cigarette.  I can't focus on anything.  

For the second time this morning, I've written my 'To Do' list.  I thought I'll start with the simple small jobs, but even these are still pending.  All I want to do is go home, sleep or play a game.  I don't want to work.  Usually, I'm fine with my work but I just can't face it now.

I know I can get through this but this is unbearable.  

Edit: Thanks guys for the encouragement. I'm off work now, had a decent bite to eat and chilling at home. I feel a lot better and might sleep it off now. I hope that was the worst of it.

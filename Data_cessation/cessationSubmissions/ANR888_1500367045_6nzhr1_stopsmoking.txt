Did you experience breathlessness after stop smoking?

Since last 2 week i feel like i can not take deep breath.Also i feel strange feeling like pain or pressure on my chest .First i thought i got cold because i ride bcycle at early morning times and sometimes the weather is little windy. ..But however it did not change with time so i start to feel worry about this and i want to think that it is about stop smoking,maybe my lungs are being clean???Did you ever experience this kind of situation after stop cigarette?  EDIT 25/7/2017 : I saw the doctor ,i do not have problem with lungs and with heart as x-ray and  Ecg cardio shown.Also standart bload test seems normal.just T4 for thyroid little high but doctor said it doesnt mean any..Not like last week but still i have strange feeling with my breath sometimes. i am very sure it is not physiological .if i find the reason i will write here.if it pass with time again i will write too for any body who feel same.

1 year! :D

Well it wont REALLY be official until about 1pm. But the badge changed and I couldn't resist.

I remember on my first week seeing people with 365 days or higher commenting and thinking it was a lifetime away and now we're here! For anyone just starting out once you really get into it the time will start to fly by and you'll forget you ever smoked those nasty things. Thanks guys :)

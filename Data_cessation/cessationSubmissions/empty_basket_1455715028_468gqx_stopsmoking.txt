I've been here before, I'm here again. Don't know how I feel yet but this has got to happen. I'm going to keep coming back.

I'm going to do everything in my power to stop finally. Cold turkey day 1. Again. Attempt #2839742987347298374.

Help me with ideas. I'll try to check in daily. Can someone be my sponsor/coach? I live abroad, so the text message quit apps aren't an option, but other apps are (I have an Android.)

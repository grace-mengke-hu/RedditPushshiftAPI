Making real progress!

I felt like making a quick update.

I started second year of college two weeks ago. At this college, a hell of a lot of people smoke. I smoked all through first year. I'm not going to lie, returning as a non-smoker was a bit strange. New routines, and for the first couple of days I did have cravings. But, the more I resisted those urges, they became easier and easier to overcome.

There's one thing I gotta mention. Most smokers at college were happy for me when I told them I didn't smoke any more. But those who were my close friends didn't want to believe it. One guy (who I don't particularly get along with) scoffed at my achievement and claimed "I'll get you back smoking." Don't worry, I told him where to shove it.

Yet again, I want to thank this community for all of their support. I feel great, and the best thing about being a non-smoker? The peace in your mind. I used to only pay half attention in lectures because I was so worried about having enough time to smoke a cigarette. Now I can relax and enjoy my work.

Thanks again, ladies and gents.

Started my 3rd day today. I can breathe so much lighter now.

I feel like a weight has come off of my entire body. Like genie from Aladdin when he was set free. Sleep came a little easier last night but probably because I was exhausted from the restlessness since Sunday (my last smoke around 9:30pm.) cravings come and go during the evening but I’ve replaced that with sleepy time tea. Gassy AF. I’ve also started a diet and working out in the evening so that helps as well.

Smoked 1yr, quit 1yr, started 3 months ago, stopped 3 days ago. Feeling like this is a successful quit.

Smoked cigarettes very heavily, they were ruining my life. Finally caught a break and managed to stay quit for a year. It was amazing. This subreddit was great for the support. Then, started smoking again in the lead up to a stressful exam. Been smoking for 3 months since then. I'm currently in in a healthcare related course and it's a really bad impression to be a smoker. I'm now on day 3 of a quit, and the cravings aren't even really that bad. Hoping to stay quit. Sort viewing the 2 week goal as a big target of mine as I remember it got a lot easier around then.

But even then, I'm totally in control right now. Mind over matter. Thought I'd let you know. Good luck to all of you currently quitting and to those of you who have stopped smoking for a while, stay away from the cigarettes.

How do you deal with those craving episodes

I'm thinking about quitting smoking. I've reached a point where I'm hitting close to a pack a day. The longest time I went without smoking was a couple of weeks and those smoking urges were insane. Suffice to say I caved and started up again. This time I've gotten my body back in shape and I think I'm better prepared for it. But those craving episodes is what I need advice on. What can I do to curb them?

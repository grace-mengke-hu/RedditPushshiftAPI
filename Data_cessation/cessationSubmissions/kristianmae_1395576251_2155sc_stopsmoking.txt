Thank you r/stopsmoking! This is the first day of the rest of my life as a nonsmoker....

....and I am both excited and terrified. 

I've smoked on and off for the last 4 years. I never meant to start, but who does? Last year, I made the conscientious decision to quit once and lasted for 9 months--before that I was a social smoker, but that changed after a really stressful period. I wish I had never started again.

 **However, today is the day I'm done for good.**

I just finished reading Easy Way, and I finally feel ready to quit. I just put out my last (and only) cig for the day, and hopefully for life. I am excited to begin the rest of my life as a nonsmoker, and I know there is so much more to gain... I'm still young, and I have my whole life ahead of me to enjoy without that nasty habit. 

I am still scared that I damaged my body, or I smoked the one cig that would give me cancer. Nonetheless, I am making the decision to be healthy again. I'm probably crazy for this, but I'm also beginning a new workout regimen to drop a few pounds/tone up now too. I was too of shape and winded to even *want* to work out. Now, I think I may be ready. Hell, I'll use my windedness as another motivator as to why I should never pick up the habit again. 

Finally, a BIG THANK YOU TO YOU ALL... I've been lurking this sub for a while now, and you guys have given me the motivation to quit.  I'm **so** thankful for everyone that's posted their stories, slip ups and successes. You all have helped me immensely, and I sincerely thank you for that. Keep on keeping on my dears.

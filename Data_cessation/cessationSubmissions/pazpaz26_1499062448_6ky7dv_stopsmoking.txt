Just started Allen Carr's book, some thoughts.

I'm looking forward to when I will feel like a non-smoker. My only thing that is conflicting with something he said in the book is that I don't hate smoking the way he did. I love the smell and the taste and the feeling, I just hate myself for doing it and I want desperately to stop letting nicotine (in any form) control my mind and behavior.

I want this to work, I want to be free. It's just hard when you hate something and love it, even when it makes you hate yourself.

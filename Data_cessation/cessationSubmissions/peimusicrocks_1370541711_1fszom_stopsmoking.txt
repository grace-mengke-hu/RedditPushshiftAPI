Smoking Dreams

I had one of these last night. In my dream I was just walking down the street and got in an argument with a friend and just took out a smoke and lit up. I took a puff or two and threw it down in disgust. I was SO mad at myself, thinking I was going to have to start the quitting process all over again, and immediately the thought came to my mind that I was going to have to reset my badge on here, hahaha. It was such a realistic dream. I was pretty happy when I woke up and clued in to the fact that I hadn't actually smoked!

Hey guys, what did you do to quit smoking when you drink alcohol?

I smoked for 10 years and quit several times, "quite successfully". Even when drinking.

This time I'm having problems. I can't believe it is easy for me to stay smoke free and then I'm drunk at a party and I smoke 2-3 cigs. I want to quit it forever.

How did you do it? Only will power? Or did you use some mind tricks Ã  la allen carr?

Thank you.

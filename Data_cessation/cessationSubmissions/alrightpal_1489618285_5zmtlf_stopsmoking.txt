New to this sub, would like some help.

I'm a 20 year old male and I've been smoking. Started at about 16 just bumming them but have been buying packs for about 2 years now. Light blue American spirits. I've been on my "last pack" for about 5 packs now and I'm getting worried. I really don't want to smoke my whole life but I'm realizing how hard it is to quit. I just love doing it. I have maybe 6 more in my pack right now and I'm nervous I'll end up buying another. Thanks for the help or support.

DAY 3. Chest tightness?

This is the first and hopefully only time I'll quit smoking. I'm on day 3 and have had random times of chest tightness and a feeling of a lump in my throat. Has anyone else experienced similar symptoms? I am a victim to anxiety and panic attacks as well (one of the reasons it was time to quit) so I'm wondering what exactly is going on with my body. I've had a lot of tightness today but hardly any anxiety. Any input or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated!

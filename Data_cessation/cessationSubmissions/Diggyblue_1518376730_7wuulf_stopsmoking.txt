I slipped!! Arggggghhhh...

Cigarettes you are a devious beast. You call to me when Iâ€™m stressed &amp; weak. I suppose your hold on me will never leave. I was done with you for a full year. But you hid in the back of my mind waiting for me to think I was in the clear. It only took one. Then a month later a pack. Then last night I stood with my husband who had quit with me &amp; we smoked together. I dragged him down with me, but together we will not do it again.  

Time to get the vape back out.

Let's quit together, whats your story?

Hey guys, this thread is part of a school assignment in my health psychology class. Ironically, I too am a smoker who is looking to quit and any information or motivation would be appreciated. Please share your story below! I'm also interested to know, what keeps you from smoking, what do you do to prevent yourself should you feel a craving (i.e. other vices?), do you know of any tools/programs that assist people with dropping the habit?

TL;DR Please share your stories, any advice, or tips below that will help others and myself to quit smoking

Smoked my last one July 4th. Celebrated independence from England and cigarettes!

I've quit a thousand times, and I was always looking for that next ideal couple of days to quit that didn't have any really stressful happenings. Then I realized that the anticipation of those "stress-free" days actually stressed me out more than just saying fuck it, and quitting. It's never the right time to quit, and yet it is. So I smoked my last one during the last few minutes of July 4th. I didn't even want it to be my last one, I was pissed when it was gone, especially because I had split it with a friend. But I did it, 10 days smoke-free, oh hell yeah.

I'm broke and lost a pack of marlboro lights yesterday...and that's when I decided to quit

I normally smoke Malboro Reds, since I was 17. But I look really young and always get ID'd (and always forget my ID) so I get nervous and kind of mumble "*20malbororedsplease*" when I'm ordering. Sometimes I'm too rushed/too apathetic to correct people if they give me Lights. Can't even taste the difference when I'm rushing a fag for smoke breaks anyway. 

But I dropped them on my way home. I *hate* losing cigarettes. They cost 11.50 euro over here!! That's so fucking much. I've already taken huge steps with diet to become healthier and I said fuck it. That's it. I didn't even really want to quit until I was up all night really thinking about it. I love smoking but fuck, I love my girlfriend and my future kids too. 

My last smoke ever was a Marlboro Light, that I smoked while walking out of work on the 18th of August 2017 and I'm posting it here to make it official. I'm going to save my baby face from premature wrinkles and be happy when people ask for my ID from now on.

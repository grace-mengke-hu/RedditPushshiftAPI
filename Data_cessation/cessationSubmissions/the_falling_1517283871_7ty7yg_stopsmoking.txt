Was prescribed Chantix today. Kind of concerned.

I’m 39 years old and have been smoking for over 20 years. I’ve been having some breathing problems lately and went to the doctor today. I know it’s time to quit smoking, so she suggested Chantix. I’ve tried the patch, the gum, cold turkey, cutting back, etc. with varying degrees off success but I inevitably started smoking again. I’ve learned that something that’s worked for me once has little to no chance of working again. 
Anyway, I’ve heard some people say that Chantix works great, and I’ve heard some horror stories. I suffer from depression pretty badly, and it has me kind of concerned about starting Chantix. Can anyone who has tried it give me some advice? Was it successful? Did it affect your quality of life, and if so, how badly?
Any help would be appreciated.

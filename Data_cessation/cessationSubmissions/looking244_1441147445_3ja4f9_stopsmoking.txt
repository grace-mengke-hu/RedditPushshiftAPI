I want just 1 more. But hear me out!

So I quit over 3 days ago. I knew I was gonna soon and the pack ended and I didn't even realise I was like huh.. guess I'll start now. My cravings really haven't been THAT bad for a pack a day 16 years smoker but what gets me down is that I never had that "last" cigarette. I never got to have a moment and know that was it
 The end. The last puff. I keep thinking well it's only been 3 days if you do that now it's not gonna make a huge difference resetting the clock. But if this is still bugging me in like a month that would be worse! Is this legitimate or is my brain using it as an excuse? It should be noted I am a bit weird like that. Very ritualistic, formal goodbyes etc lol.

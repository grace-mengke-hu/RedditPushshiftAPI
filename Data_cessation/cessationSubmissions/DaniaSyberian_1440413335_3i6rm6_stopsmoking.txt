Hello, I'm new

I'm 26, been smoking since 16. I always knew cigarettes were bad for me, but they were part of my little routine to calm myself and to feel alright when things get bad. I remember many scary and sad nights where I was smoking, and the smoke "calmed me". That what I thought, at least. I also remember many awesome and beautiful nights, cigarettes was always involved. I always thought "I'll give up when I'm older", but I didn't. My mom smoked for almost 40 years, until she got really sick and went to open heart surgery. She's no longer smoking (she's alive and well), but I still am. Like that wasn't motivational enough. I feel like I'm giving up a part of me. When things get busy, I just wait for my perfect opportunity to make myself a cup of coffee and to smoke. Not sure what to do now, will coffee taste differently? What to expect first 5 days, 10 days, month? Thanks for any encouragement words :)

Help! Redditors who quit with hypnosis did it work? If so are you religious?

I need to quit and have tried a few times before. Chantix twice. the second time I got suicidal thoughts and was depressed which I noticed because it's not like me. Tried a couple different low end vaporizers to ween off but again started back up. Also tried the gum but ended up smoking while chewing. I suck at this and fear I ran out options to help. The longest I went without was maybe 8 months. 

I have a feeling I'm not gonna be able to fall in hypnosis. Curious if it's seriously worked for anyone? If so a simple yes or not to the second question of whether or not you are religious is fine. Not looking for a religious argument here. Just I have never met anyone who has been under hypnosis that was not religious. I am not and fear this may have a correlation to the ability to fall under for proper results. Any other advice for quitting is also very appreciated.

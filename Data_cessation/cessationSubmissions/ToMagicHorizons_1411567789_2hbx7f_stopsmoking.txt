I have been trying for years, but I'm finding it impossible to quit nicotine

Greetings /r/stopsmoking.  I'm a 25 year old male who started smoking when I was 18.  I was hooked instantly;  I just wanted to try it and it ended up consuming my life.  Fast forward to 7 years later and I think about wanting to quit every day, but I just... can't.  I've made several attempts...  The best I've done is 4 days.  It hurts me to think that I was almost free at that time.  

I have tried:  

Cold turkey
Allen Carr
Patches
Gum
Ecig

I have tried everything but I can't go more than 6 hours without a cigarette without my mind screaming at me.  I go crosseyed.  

I don't love the feeling of withdrawal, but I genuinely feel healthier 6 hours without a cigarette, other than some discomfort in the lungs and... teeth.  I feel like I'm missing something crucial that will help me out.  

So, any suggestions?

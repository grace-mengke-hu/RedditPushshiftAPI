Quitting tomorrow after 16 years of smoking (i'm 28 so yes, was quite young)

Tried and failed a few times, but this is my oldest habbit, i barely remember life without it.. i quit smoking weed 5 years ago, it was surprisingly easy (smoked everyday for about 5 years before that) any advice as to how i can cope? I've considered working out to release some stress but i feel like i need something else to make me take a natural break and relax.. kinda nervous about it but i plan to put out my last cig tonight when i go to bed..

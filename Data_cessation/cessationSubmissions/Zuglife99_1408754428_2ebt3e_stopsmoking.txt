A question about quitting and weight

So I'm overweight and a smoker. Been telling myself for quite some time that I am going to get healthy by quitting smoking and also losing weight. However, when I tried to do both at the same time I failed (multiple attempts).

So I thought I could do one at a time. First I tried to quit smoking first, but ended up binge eating like you wouldn't believe. I then decided to lose weight first and it was quite successful (lost around 20 kg/44 lbs) but the smoking was a huge crutch to keep me from overeating.

I've now regained some of the weight, and am still smoking and I'm finally ready to 'man-up' and finish both jobs.

My question is how do I tackle both at the same time?

P.S. The biggest struggle for me when quitting is that I become super lethargic. If I decide to quit smoking the next day, I can't even get out of bed in the morning. I end up sleeping 14 or more hours for the first week. Any suggestions at all welcomed, thank you!

0mg Disposable Vape?

I enjoyed the act of smoking. If there's one thing I cannot do as I quit, it's delude myself. I disappointed my boyfriend when I told him I don't like cigarettes but I know if still enjoy one.

They are like the ex you just broke up with. You know you shouldn't miss them but you might. You miss the good bits. You're going it alone.

I know cigarettes are no longer an option. But for the occasional occurrence, would a 0mg disposable vape be ok? Like, I've smoked a shisha pipe with friends before and didn't end up doing that every day. If I keep it in mind that the vape isn't regularly used or a habit, is that likely to work? The shisha struck me as a special occasion situation. But I guess smoking did once upon a time too.

Am I asking these questions because I don't have a reasonable idea of what 'too much' is because that's what defines an addict?

Or is it because I don't trust myself to use a vape less often than not?

In a sense, I hate this monologue because I am sure that displaying all these doubts and ju st indications just looks like one big craving and I shouldn't smoke anything at all.

I haven't craved that much this week to be honest. But it's the weekend and we have the kids. Smoking (outside and out of sight!) was my break. Maybe it's just hit a trigger.

Doubts

I quit smoking 23 days ago and I think I have made it to the point where I can say that my cravings are minimal. I was smoking for 3 years and at my worst 10 cigarettes a day. Cigarettes made happy for some reason, I could enjoy the little moments in life like hanging out with friends at 11pm at the park and smoking cigarettes or climbing ar the top of a tree and enjoying a cigarette while having a nice view, drinking coffee in the morning was so enjoyable with cigarettes and I know this is the nicotine addiction, but I cant imagine being a non smoker for the rest of my life. I know if I reach a high age I will start smoking immediately or If I only had 2 years to live I would be smoking because it wouldnt matter any more. This is the addiction talking I know, but for the last 23 days I felt like something was missing. Is it really worth to quit? Fuck I feel like the addiciton is taking control of me. I thougt about buying an e cig, just to get some nicotine, but probably wont do it.

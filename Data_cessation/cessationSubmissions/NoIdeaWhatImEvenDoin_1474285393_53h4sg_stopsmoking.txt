Today is 6 months

I'm happy to say that today is 24 weeks or 6 months, no smoking cold turkey. I can not believe I did it. For anyone out there just starting their quitting journey, or contemplating whether they should or not, just do it!!! You CAN overcome smoking. You ARE stronger than you think!! I smoked a pack or more every day for almost a decade. I never thought I'd be posting 6 months clean. I can do it, you can do it. Quit!!

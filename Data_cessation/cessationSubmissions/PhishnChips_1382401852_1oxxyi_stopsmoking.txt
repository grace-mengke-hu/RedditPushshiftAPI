Does using the nicotine lozenges work well for you?

I quit for 9 months last year using them while my wife was pregnant, but started up smomking again STOOOOOPIDLY after our daughter was born. Now a year and a half later I've decided enough is enough and I want to stop. I smoked my last cigarette at 730 am this morning (it's 730 pm now). I've been using the 4 milligram nicotine lozenges all day, yet I still feel shaky and full of that inner turmoil you go through when you first start a quit. 

What are your guy's thoughts on the nic lozenges, and any advice on maintaining my sanity while the fires rage inside my chest, that yearning feeling to just step outside and give in won't stop today.

Over a year later - cravings.

It's been nearly 600 days since I quit. In the past year I've had a slight craving every now and then, especially after seeing someone else smoking. But in the past couple days, I have had the most intense cravings since I last quit. I'm starting to get scared that the next time I go into a convenience store, I will ask for a pack and a lighter. What do you do when you get those incredibly intense, visceral cravings, like you can almost taste a cigarette on the tip of your tongue, and you feel like just smoking one will satisfy?

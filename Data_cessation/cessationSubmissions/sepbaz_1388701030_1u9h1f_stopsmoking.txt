Cold Turkey on New Years Day

I just had my last cigarette on New Years Eve (well more like 5 am on New Years Day). I always thought the best way to go about it was to 'be ready to quit', and then to just do it cold turkey; like ripping off a band-aid. I have a really nice tobacco pipe that I will be using a few times a week to tide me over, but I'm totally done with cigarettes. 

Today is day 2, and I haven't really craved a smoke. I wonder, reddit, is there a really tough period coming that I should be aware of? I have been smoking for just under 10 years. Do you have any tips for me to keep it up? I have friends to keep me accountable, but other than friends and my pipe, I'm pretty much just givin'er. 

Would love to hear your thoughts/advice/tips/etc. Thanks!

First whole day no cigs

I smoked for three years, quit for 4, and now I've been smoking about fir almost five years. I honestly hate it. I hate no being able to taste, hate planning my life around cigarettes, hate having to feel the addiction. I hate the obsessive thoughts, and all the allergies I get. There is nothing good about smoking. Unfortunately, i had anxiety and every time i try to quit cold turkey I give up because I start having an anxiety attack. Im also scared that im going to get fired from work for briefly becoming a crazy person. I tried the patch and my hair started falling out. The gun tadtes gross. I really don't want to find out what medication will do to my head. So that leaves just stopping as the only option. I got through today, but the real challenge will be work on thursday.

Symptoms after quitting smoking, anyone else?

Hello all! First off, I would like to say that this sub is awesome as well as anyone that's a part of it.

 I quit originally quit on August 23rd. I was using the patches for about a week and a half until I cut off nicotine completely. Though on September 15th I had 2 cigarettes, nothing since. I actually thew that pack away because it was disgusting and not enjoyable.

&amp;#x200B;

I am now nearing 17 days smoke free, not using anything to supplement such as patches or gum.

I have 0 desire to smoke at all, anything. This is relieving, though I am now struggling with other symptoms. My anxiety is through the roof, I can barely sleep, and I'm having uncomfortable physical symptoms. Often, I feel a knot in my chest and I have to walk around to not think about it. I also feel that quitting has triggered GERD/acid reflux. Weird, I know. I also have bad thoughts that I often cannot get out of my head from the time I wake up until I sleep. I feel sick on and off constantly. I have been to the doctors and they have prescribed me "medicine" for anxiety. To be clear, I refuse to take those. I'm drinking several different types of tea to not turn to other drugs. Oolong tea has helped a little bit mentally recently, and ginger tea has helped with the gas/acidity related issues. I don't remember having these issues at all during those years of smoking. Maybe this is normal?

I'm not sure how I can handle this otherwise, maybe exercise? Though it may help comfort knowing that I am not alone with these symptoms, or if any one of you have experienced similar issues after quitting smoking.

TLDR:

Having extreme anxiety, physical symptoms about 17 days after quitting smoking. Looking for advice or how you coped with this, if you did.

Three days. Just subscribed to this sub.

Not the longest I've gone. I went about 4 weeks a couple years ago.

I'm 20 y/o. I had my first cigarette when I was 12, and I started smoking regularly around 16.

Anyways, I recently started vaping. 3mg nicotine, though I might go higher. I know its probably just as bad, but vaping has helped before. Though it never actually satisfied the urge for a real smoke. I guess its the other hundreds of chemicals other than nicotine that are causing the real craving. 


The thing is, I've never had trouble putting the vape down, even when I wasn't smoking at all. I guess because it's just not the real thing. It can't as unhealthy as smoking, but it's still not something I plan on doing for very long. I'll wait a couple weeks and then I'll get rid of my e-cig. 


Anyone here know a bit more on the subject of vaping? Just how much better is it than smoking, if at all? I wouldn't be surprised if it actually wasn't better at all. But it's far less addictive to me, and it's helping.

Is vaping, cheating?

I stopped smoking about 1 month ago.  This is the longest I have gone without a cigarette in about 8 years, since I first started.  I took up vaping, and havn't touched a cigarette since.

Is this cheating? I know vaping must also be bad for my health, but not as much, right? I know the ultimate goal is to no longer depend on nicotine.  So I thought this was a good start.

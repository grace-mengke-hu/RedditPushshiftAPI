How angry is too angry...?

I need some perspective here. Please bear with me, this is my first ever reddit post (yay!) I literally joined for the sole purpose of being able to interact on this subreddit. 

So I went strong for 5 days. Five great days. Was I stressed? Yes. Was I cranky? Heeelll yeah. But today I caved HARD. I was angry about EVERYTHING. Another meeting at work added to my overloaded plate? I saw red. Manager asked a silly question? Wanted to throw my laptop against the wall. Subway running behind? Start wishing horrible things on the train driver and his family. 

I guess what I need to know is is it normal to feel THIS overwhelmed by everything. I caved and bought a pack and am actually writing this as I smoke a cigarette and hate myself for it. I just don’t know how I’ll manage to quit if I feel so angry and annoyed by every. Little. Thing. All. The. Time. 

Any advice? Thoughts? Do I just need to chill the eff out? Help!

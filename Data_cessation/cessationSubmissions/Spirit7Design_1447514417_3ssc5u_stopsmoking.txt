Fell off the wagon for about a month

Grrrr, I made it over 100 days, and then I bummed on cigarette from a coworker.  I cockily thought, "I can handle one", but one turned into two, then three, and before I knew what i was doing, I was buying packs again.

Well, I'm starting fresh this morning.  I know I felt tons better and I was happier with myself and my life when I was not smoking, but it is still really hard to start this quite over.

Back to day 1....I can do it again and make it stick!

EDIT: I also wanted to say, stumbling across this page  is what made me realize I could quit the first time,and the stories and support are what helped it stick. I'll try not to be a stranger after a few months this time.

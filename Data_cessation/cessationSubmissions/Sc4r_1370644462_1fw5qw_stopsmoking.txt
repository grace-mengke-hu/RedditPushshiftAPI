My fourth day is now officially over. I feel GREAT!

My fourth day is now officially over and it's going great. The first 3 days were horrible tough because of those massive cravings, cold sweat, restless sleep and so on. 

Today i "survived" day 4 and it wasn't that bad. Sure i had cravings, but they felt less horrible. May be a mental thing because many sources say that after 3 days all of the nicotine is out of the body, and knowing that helped me a lot.

My biggest thanks go out to you guys of /r/stopsmoking,your storys and to those tons of Fisherman's Friends i've been eating. Thanks to those i'm the guy with the best breath at work ;)

I will stay strong and keep this poison out of my lungs and bloodstream!

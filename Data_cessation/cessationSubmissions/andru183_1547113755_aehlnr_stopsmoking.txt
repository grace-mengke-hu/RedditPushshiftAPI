Just out out my last one

I'm in Ho Chi Minh airport. Today I move to Melbourne to start a new life. I'm from Ireland. I just put out my last cigarette. I'm using the flight and the fact I have no routine in a new country as a way to stop smoking. I feel good about quitting and want this to be the time it sticks. No roll ups. No cigarettes. No ecig. Nothing.

Wish me luck :)

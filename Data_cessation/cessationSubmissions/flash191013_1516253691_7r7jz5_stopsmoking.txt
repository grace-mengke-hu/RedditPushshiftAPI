Not smoked since Xmas day. But the wife's away this wknd and it's the real test.

So I gave up smoking on Xmas day. Odd choice maybe but never been one for News Years resolutions. Xmas day felt right and a propa test. 

I've smoked for years. I was a heavy weed smoker for 15plus years. I moved to the Middle East and my drug addiction went and my
Smoking increased. 

A pack a day maybe more. If I'm boozing then who knows, could be 2 packs. 

I like it. A black coffee and a smoke is a genuine enjoyment of mine! 

But my wife is 7months pregnant with our first child and she hates it. And I don't wana be stinking every time I hold my beautiful new baby! It was time. 

So I've gone cold turkey. I brought that Alan Carr book but I didn't read it. I just stopped. 

I miss the social element. Chatting to ppl. The escape. I still wander outside on occasions. Go stand by the smokers, feeling semi smug that I have made 1 month. Feels good. Nice to regain some control over my own will power.

But the wife is away this wknd. As I said I love a smoke when boozing. And this wknd I will booze as with impending parenthood it is necessary to make the most of it! I've drunk since quitting and not touched any. But I have a strong feeling like the fact my wife is away I'll mentally use it as an excuse as no one that matters would know! 

I intend to remain strong. The first weeks are always the hardest and it makes no sense to start that process all over again! 

Let's see what happens - keeping my little baby in my mind all wknd, proving my strength of character for them! 

Peace ✌️

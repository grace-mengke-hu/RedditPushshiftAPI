FOURTEEN DAYS!

Well, this is my two week check in. I've hardly had any cravings after the first three days. I am feeling so much better, I have more energy, I definitely have my confidence back. And I started yoga classes again this weekend!

I am SO excited for my vacation. I am going on a cruise from the 26th - 1st. The last time I went on a cruise, I was constantly breaking away for a smoke. Bahamas smoke free here I come!

7 & 1/2 months!

This subreddit has been amazing support through out the course of quitting. I used an ecig for a little while (with 0 nicotine) and now i'm not even using that. I do get cravings sometimes, but thats usually when i'm around friends that smoke, so they are easy to handle. I've noticed recently that i'm bringing up white phlegm lately, is this because my lungs have begun to repair themselves? Thanks again guys

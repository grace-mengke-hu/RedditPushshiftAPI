Unexpected Cessation Symptoms

I've read up on it a little bit, but I'm wondering if anyone else is having problems passing BMs after quitting.  While I was smoking, I was so regular, but I'm now  having problems with it.   I've quit for 62 days and I miss my morning, post coffee and cigarette dumps.

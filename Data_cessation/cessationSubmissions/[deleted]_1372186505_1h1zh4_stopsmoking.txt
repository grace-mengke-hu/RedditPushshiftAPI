I'm going to quit smoking! Just wanted to put it out there

Reasons are to many to list, but at the moment I'm afraid I drive my neighbors nuts with my non-stop smoking and I start doing something where they don't *really allow* smoking. I also want to quit and I've never been a huge fan of cigarettes. 


I'll update here how's it going. I don't have a time table but sooner I get rid of the habit the better it is. I have those nicotine replacement things and thought about breathing in a paper bag if I feel like I need to smoke (obviously healthier than smoking). 


Putting out my plans and goals out there in the open might not be wise, but I'm going to quit sooner or later so it doesn't really matter. If it fails this time at least I have something to come back to and ponder why it happened.

Convince me to not start.

I am 21 years old and I have never had tobacco in my life. I know that smoking is expensive and terribly and unhealthy, but I've somehow had some urges for a few months to start smoking. The appeal comes from wanting the satisfaction of indulging after craving, and wanting to do something with my hands if I'm sitting around doing nothing. I figure you guys would know best, what thoughts about smoking should I replace in my head so that I don't want to start?

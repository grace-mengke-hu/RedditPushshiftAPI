I haven't smoked for two weeks :D

The first 5 days were easy except for the craving (i used to smoke a pack a day at least). Since those 5 days though I've felt pretty horrible, most of the time especially when I'm bored and I get bored a lot haha. Does anyone have any tips on how not to feel sad? xD

Day 6 and my experience so far

A few months back, i made a post claiming i wasnt sure if i was addicted even though i had been a pack a day smoker. I quit almost 6 days ago and so far, its been incredibly easy. I heard the first 3 days were the hardest, but they were surprisingly easy aswell. I havent had any physical cravings for a smoke since i stopped. I mean every once in awhile, id see my brother or whoever have a smoke and consider having one, but it wasnt really hard for me to say no. I had been smoking for over a year prior to attempting to quit. Was i even addicted? Or am i just lucky so far? Thanks in advance for responses and for just being a great subreddit in general.

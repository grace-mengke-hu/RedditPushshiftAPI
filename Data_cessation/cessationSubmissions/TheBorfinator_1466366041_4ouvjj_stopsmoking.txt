Replacing the short escape a smoke break provides?

My girlfriend is trying to quit and shared with me her anxiety about losing that "break" where she can go be alone with her thoughts, etc throughout the day. What approaches have worked for you short of taking the same breaks, just without a cigarette in hand?

100 hours.

It's been 100 hours and damn has it been rough. I had my bachelor party last weekend, smoked my brains out, and quit last Monday. It's not my first time on the wagon like most of us, but this has been the hardest week I've ever had. 

I have been an absolute asshole to everyone who has crossed my path. I've been angry all week. Like just an undercurrent of anger. I wish I could turn it off. Its simply my brain being very upset with me. I sure hope that I can keep it up. I've quit for long periods before. I just hope this will be the last.

one week clean. few cravimgs, nothing bad. getting better. saved 60 $ so far

oh lord what a feeling. thats all. I feel like im there. never thought I would pull it off. dont give up folks.

I tried everything. patches, gum, pills, ecigs. you name it. what worked was getting in the mindset and overcoming myths about smoking.  then I went and bought another pack and consciously smoked each one realizing they did nothing for me. taught myself to hate them. and read Allan Carr s book of course

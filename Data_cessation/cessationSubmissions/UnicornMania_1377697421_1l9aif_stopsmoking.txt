So I relapsed after 11 days

Ive been lurking this subreddit for a couple weeks and its what really pushed me to try and quit so thank you to everyone on here who has contributed.
I thought I was clear sailing I had no urges and was on day 11 and thought the worst of it was behind me. Then I moved back up to school and I instantly had the craziest urge to smoke and I ended up giving in.
I am demotivated to try quitting again right now. I have read The Book and it helped, but I can't help but feel I get comfort and pleasure from smoking

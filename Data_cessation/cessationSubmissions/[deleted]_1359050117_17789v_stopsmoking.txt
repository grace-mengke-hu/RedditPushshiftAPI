Doing it again: day 2. What worked and what didn't.

After reading Carr's book, I quit for a week or so last year. Then I went back knowing it was useless, just a way to passively hurt myself. I quit again and lasted 3 months. Went back for a month or so. Finally woke up sick of it two days ago. Quit again. 

What works:

- Ruining your leftover cigs. Wetting them, throwing them in the toilet, whatever. It works better for me when I ruin some of them, as opposed to finishing a pack and then quitting. The next few hours / days it's a bigger motivation not to buy a new pack, since it feels like I invested those ruined cigs and their cost in the quitting effort.
- Being happy about quitting
- Immediately calling yourself a non-smoker
- What I call automatic denial: the first days, I'll think about cigarettes about 30 times a day. Each time, the inner dialogue goes something like this: "oh! cigarettes! NO. You're a non-smoker." After one or two days it's automatic.
- Breathing: immediately after denying myself the cig, I take a deep breath of fresh air and that seems to calm the anxiety.
- Oral anxiety: chewing non-sugary gum, having a bottle of fresh water nearby at all times.
- Exercise. This has been helping a lot, I've been doing spinning and weightlifting three times a week. I'm adding yoga soon.
- Other activities: I'm having trouble finding things to do when I'm not doing anything or bored. Cigs seemed to be the default go-to thing to do at all times.
- Don't quit things you used to do with cigarettes. Like going out, taking a walk, hanging out with friends, drinking, having coffee... Try to enjoy them free of cigarettes.

What doesn't work (aka what got me back to it):

- Complaining ("argh, I NEED a cigarette SO BAD right now!")
- "Oh, look! It was actually quite easy to go cigarette-free for 3 days / 3 months! I could celebrate by smoking one!"
- "Just one" <-- It is never, ever ever, just one.
- "I need it because _____________" <-- you never need it.

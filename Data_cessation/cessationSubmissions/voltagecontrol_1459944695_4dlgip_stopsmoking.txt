I CAN'T DO IT! Or, how did you finally stop smoking after so many failed attempts?

I've been stopping and starting for a little over a year now. I'm exasperated. I keep trying to stop, and then I convince myself I want cigarettes afterall, and that I'll stop next week. I try to stop the next week, and I do it all over again, smoking more and more every time I consider stopping again. I'm fighting myself on this. 

I'm really down about it.

For those who've been in this cycle, what did you do to break it? 

Or maybe I should be asking how did you convince yourself you actually want to endure the cravings and discomfort, the non-smoking, the life without the haze and terrible stench? Because I feel I want it, and at the same time I'm disgusted by it. 


edit: Thanks to everyone for the great advice!

1.000.000 seconds and still craving

I quit cold turkey 11 days ago after 25 years of smoking. Pleased and relieved, but also overthinking it a lot. No physical cravings, but thoughts about smoking that keep coming back. I keep having the same discussion over and over in my head. Itâ€™s hard and I hate it.

Finally done.

I’m 19 years old and have been smoking since I was about 16, this has been by far one of the hardest things to do especially coming from a family of smokers and having to be around it all the time however I’ve been cig free for a whole 3 months!!! Honestly never thought I could make it but it just gets easier everyday.

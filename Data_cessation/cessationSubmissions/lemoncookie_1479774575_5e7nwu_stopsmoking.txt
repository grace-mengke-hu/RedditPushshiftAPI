Smoked for just about 30 years. Went cold turkey few months ago and used Pokemon GO to help.

I used a patch a few times in the first week when the cravings got bad. Mostly, when I had a craving I went for a walk and caught Pokemon. 
I am 49 years old and did not feel one bit foolish. It was something to do with my hands, my brain, to break my patterns, get me outside and moving.
People laughed, but whatever works. Good luck all of you!

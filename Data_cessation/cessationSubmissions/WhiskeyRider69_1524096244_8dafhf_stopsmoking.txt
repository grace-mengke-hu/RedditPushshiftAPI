Well that's good to know

Wondering why insomnia was starting to creep in on me. Turns out that nicotine causes your body to process caffeine at a higher rate. I used to drink a lot of Mountain Dew and kinda went back to it to help me deal with the fog brain and narcolepsy at the beginning of my quit. Guess that wasn't a good idea. 

I'm gonna end up suffering one more night since it's too late for today, but tomorrow I'll be to cut out caffeine around 3pm. Sleep well quitters. We can do this.

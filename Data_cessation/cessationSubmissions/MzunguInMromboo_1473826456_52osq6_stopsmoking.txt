So, I went to a bachelor party this weekend....

I smoked a cigarette. It had been 4 weeks and was 3/4 of the way through the night — I barely remember it. It's the drunkest I've been in more than a year. I feel guilt but it's been 72 hours and I haven't had a strong urge to smoke one, but I just did have a fleeting thought of grabbing a pack. 

I know this isn't tips, tricks, or asking for advice — it just helps me to write this down and broadcast to a friendly group of people that know the struggle.

Stay strong everyone.

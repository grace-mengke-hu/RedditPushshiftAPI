Smoking my last now...

I went with my boyfriend and his friends on a hike. When I was younger this would be nothing. My father and I used to do 50 mile hikes out for a week at a time. 

I got maybe a mile in with some steep hills (Misson Peak in California). I had to turn back. I couldn't breathe. My hands were swollen and my feet barely fit my shoes. I could hear them asking, "why is she turning around?" I felt like shit. I sat by the car breathing heavy after dragging my feet back to wait.

I don't want to be that. This is it.

I tried and failed numerous times, but this.. This is when it all ends..

After 2 years of trying to quit smoking, I've reluctantly purchased a vaporizer, but I'm 2 days in and the cravings aren't bad. I know some people frown upon the use of vaporizers but to me it's been a big help and I'll continue to use it. The community here is amazing and I hope I can look to you, the beautiful people of /r/stopsmoking when I'm at my lowest.

Cheers, Good Luck and Good work to those who want to, and those who have quit,

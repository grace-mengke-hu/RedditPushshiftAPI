I'm at two hours-feels like it's been weeks.

I just hit the two hour mark for like the thousandth time. I keep telling myself that I'm afraid if I have one more I'll never stop. It's just the frustration and irritabilityand depression that keep coming in waves make it hard to remember that. Any advice?

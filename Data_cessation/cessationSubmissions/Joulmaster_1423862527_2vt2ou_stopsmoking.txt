The morning of Day 5

Good morning I'm sitting here with my coffee, which I've surprisingly found I've been able to enjoy without some terrible trigger to smoke, probably because I simply love a warm cup in the morning :). 

Last evening / night were indeed the most intense battle I've had yet. All the time tables and sites like to say that withdrawals will peak within 72 hours, but for me it was at 96 hours on the dot that I started to tingle with craving....I made it thought. I've notice that cravings come with their own wonderful irony. Like the same buzzing, warm, wanting, feeling is woven in with the simply fact that my capillaries are not constricted and my breathing is easy going...I'm getting hit with waves of Euphoria mix with waves of disgust mixed with waves of pure yearning....and honestly i'm kinda having fun with it all. I used the allen carr method and I'm sitting here in the middle of the frying pan laughing and analyzing my "withdrawals" and to be honest the whole endeavor seems like a fascinating exploration of self. Maybe the child in me that used to hold his breath when walking by smokers is finally laughing in triumph and taking a kind of pleasure as the other part of my mind, the addicted persona, writhes and withers...fades out.

Getting ridiculously angry without cigarettes? How should I tackle this?

Hi guys,

So basically, I really, really would like to stop smoking since this asthma/(possibly COPD?) thing is getting out of control as I'm starting to have very noticable shortness of breath in the mornings and am coughing up a lot of grey mucous as well.

I'm 24, been smoking for 10 years. See the problem is, I'm very short tempered (inherited trait from my family...) and cigarettes have been my go to relief as I was growing up (even though I know they don't do shit to calm you down except for satisfying your nicotine crave).

Now, by short tempered I don't mean I become grumpy. It's more like if I don't smoke for 9 or 10 hours, I become extremely volatile. Like, randomly punching brick walls upon the slightest inconvenience and getting so angry my vision goes blurry.

Needless to say, this lessens significantly if I use nicotine gums or the like, but I heard cold turkey was the most effective method. (Edit: I also tried to quit using nicotine replacement products at least 20 times before and always failed.) So what should I do?

I appreciate it if you read this and give me some advice.

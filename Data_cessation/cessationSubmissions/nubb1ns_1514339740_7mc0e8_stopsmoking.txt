If I quit, will I ever be able to drink again without a craving ruining my night?

Looking for success stories. How do your cravings affect your drinking? Or vice versa. I'm not an excessive or frequent drinker by any means, but I do know that, for me at least, cigarettes and booze go hand in hand and I have never drank without smoking.

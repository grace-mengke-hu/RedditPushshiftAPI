688 days, No cigarettes...

in September, It'll be 2 years for me since the last time I picked up a cigarette. I just want you guys to know who are struggling, Just put your mind to it, and you can do it. Have faith in yourself, and find something to occupy the minutes you spent smoking. 

I browse (it's actually on my default) subreddit a lot, and I'm here to ask questions to.

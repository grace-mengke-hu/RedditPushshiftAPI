Woo Hoo for Seeing Stars

So, today's my 1 year mark for quitting smoking. After probably 4 serious attempts (and many, many not-so-serious attempts), I'm finally here. I couldn't have done it without you folks. I've mostly been lurker but I've read people's stories of how they've tried to quit and incorporated what worked for them into my plan to quit.

As a reminder to myself of where I've come and a help to those who aren't quite there yet, here's a few things that helped me:

1) You **can** quit. Don't you shake your head at me and shut up with that excuse you were about to say, you **CAN** quit. Keep telling yourself this, especially through the first week and it'll eventually come true.

2) One day/minute/second at a time. Whatever you have to do to not have that next cigarette. Drink water, talk yourself through it, whatever you have to do to get through it. Trust me, it gets easier the more you do it so stick with it. Also, if you don't want to gain a huge amount of weight but eating is your thing, sugar-free Jello/Jelly works well.

3) Constantly and consistently remind yourself of the things that are better now that you don't smoke. For me, it was being able to climb a flight of stairs without being winded at the top, not smelling like an ashtray, and not having to hide the fact that I smoked (which I found out later everyone knew anyway. Seriously, mother's have this freaky psychic thing going on.)

4) Start to associate negative things to smoking. For some it'll be the health risks, others it'll be their children. There has to be a good reason to compel you to stop smoking.

5) You don't have to gain weight. Actually, I ended up going on a keto diet a few months in and ended up *losing* almost 50 lbs (23kg). It also helped me focus on something else besides smoking and made me overall more cognizant of my health. I'm almost 40 (<shutters>) so that's getting to be a bigger and bigger thing now.

6) Know your triggers and plan out a way to combat them. You're going to have moments of weakness. It's a lot better to know what to do beforehand than think on your toes (which never works out if you're jouncing for a smoke.)

It does get better. It took me a while before my "smoking dreams" went away (where I dreamt that I had a cigarette and woke up feeling like "shit, well I screwed that up".) Now I'm having dreams where smoking made me sick. Do I still get cravings? Yep. But they're so minimal now that they're more of an annoyance than anything else. And they're probably a holdover since I smoked for my entire adult life and that's all I knew as a coping mechanism.

So, go get 'em and just quit already. There is never going to be a good time... ever. The best thing is to make a resolution to yourself that you're going to do away with this thing that's controlling you and just stick with it... using any means necessary (well, maybe not homicide or anything else illegal for that matter, but you get my point.)

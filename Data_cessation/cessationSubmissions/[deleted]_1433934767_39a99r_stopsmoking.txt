Last night was my last cig, I am just sick of smoking and am ready.

I am having withdrawls right now, but you know what. I am just sick of smoking. The withdrawl is the addiction dying in me, and having a cigarette would only further perpetuate the addiction.

I read Allen Carrs stop smoking. My mental state has changed, I am sick of spending money on killing myself, I am sick of head colds and coughing all the time, I am sick of the anxieties of worrying about needing cigarettes, I am sick of being associated with the other smokers who I never imagined I would be grouped with. I always viewed smoking as gross and now that is me! Women hate it, my friends and family do. It's time to quit.

My biggest thing though? I haven't been in the moment be it family dinners, events, sporting events, usually I am worrying about my next cigarette! I am freeing myself of this beast. Many physiological studies will tell you, the key to happiness...being in the moment, enjoying things and appreciating things as they happen, cigarettes take this join from us.

Undoubtedly, cigarettes was my biggest insecurity, I hated it so much but was afraid to quit--now that mindset has changed. I gain nothing from smoking cigarettes only tremendous shame, guilt, expense, health compromise, etc. 

Thanks for the venting session!

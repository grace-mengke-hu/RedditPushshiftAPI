Well hello fingernails!

It's just over six weeks since I quit and along with all of the many benefits to my health I noticed recently that since I quit my fingernails have started growing rapidly - like, really fast! So much so that I'm cutting them weekly as they're getting so long they are annoying me every week. Anyone else notice this? I think it's a clear song my body was on a bad path with cigarettes and I'm on the right track

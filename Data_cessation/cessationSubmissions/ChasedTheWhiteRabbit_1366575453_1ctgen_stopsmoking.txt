1 year smoke free + first 10k race completed = bliss

Yesterday was an awesome day, I finished my first 10k race ever in 54:45 minutes and also made it to 1 year smoke free!. 

It's been a long and hard and painful way since last year when I lit my last cig and put on my running shoes, but It was well worth it. 

I feel like the race was my graduation from /stopsmoking.

I've said it before and I'll say again:

/stopsmoking + /running = winning combo.

I'll wear my /stopsmoking badge proudly a so will [this one](http://i.imgur.com/zP4BvaP.jpg?1)

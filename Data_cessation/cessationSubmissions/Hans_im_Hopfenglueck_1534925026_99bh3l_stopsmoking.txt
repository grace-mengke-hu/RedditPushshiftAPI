Am joining you guys, my body is ready

(Male, 23 years, 6 years smoking) 

After a recent 4 day smoking and drug binge (weed, cigarettes, cocaine) at a very dusty festival I developed an so-called peritonsillar abscess, basically an infection/inflammation next to the tonsils. I'm still in hospital for antibiotical treatment right now. I couldn't really eat or sleep well for a week due to the swallowing pain and lost quite a lot of weight. So now I've been smoke-free for 4 days and once I get released, I'm just going to continue. 

The friends who were with me during the festival also expressed their concern of me smoking that much and seem very relieved to hear me quitting it. Sometimes, we don't listen to what is actually best for us and don't realize how self-destructive some behavior is until such a moment comes. I'll definitely take this to heart and stop this self-poisoning shit before it kills me.

I got my chewing gum, my Allan Carr and most importantly, my will. This isn't always going to be easy, especially as I'm a routine kind of person, but fuck me, this is a great opportunity. I don't want you to wish me luck because it's my own power of will but you know, some encouragement is always nice :)

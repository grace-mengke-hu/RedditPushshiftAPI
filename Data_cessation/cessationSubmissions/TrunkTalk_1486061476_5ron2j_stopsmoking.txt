No one prepared me for the dreams.

Hey folks! Apologies if this has been mentioned before, but has anyone had a dream where they cave, and then wake up feeling immense guilt? 

Or, even worse- you forget the dream upon waking up, and later you have a faint memory that you might have cheated? 

Ugh. Still going strong, but the mind is playing tricks on me. Smh.

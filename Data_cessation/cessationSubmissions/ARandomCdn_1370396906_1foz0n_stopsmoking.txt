Dear Smoking, It's Time We Call This Thing Off

I am aging into another decade soon and recently came to the realization I have been smoking over half of my life. I have been reading some inspirational posts here, and thought this is a community I may turn to for some support.   
I know better than this, yet it continues. 15 years, only missing three days on a failed attempt to stop. (Which I slept through.) I have spent so much time and money on making myself unhealthy. Today I decide enough is enough.   
I am not lacking information, I have read Alan Carr's books, tips on how to pass urges, blogs and posts, but the the thing I may be missing from all of those lists is the support. Most of the friends I am closest with are smokers and the family members that aren't are the ones that expect me to fail. Maybe if I have somewhere to turn to when I need an extra push I can succeed at this.   
If all goes well, my name will have a '1' beside it tomorrow.   
I have saved some awesome posts to reference back to in the future but figured you all seem so supportive of each other I would share my story.   
Thanks everybody.

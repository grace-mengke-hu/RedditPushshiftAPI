Any advice I can give my mom and brother who have successfully quit but are still on Nicotine patches and gum.

They expressed interest in cutting out the nicotine all together, but both have apprehensions about how uncomfortable it will be.  Is there any way to get through the withdrawals besides just gritting your teeth and toughing it out? 

I wish I could provide them with advice, but I only smoked for a few months before quitting, compared to their 10+ years, and I didn't find it all that difficult.  I must not have developed too severe of a dependency in that short of a time, so I am really stuck here.  Any advice?

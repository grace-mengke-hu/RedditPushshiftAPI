Why am I now envious of smokers?

A little passed the two weeks mark and the cravings have subsided greatly.  I'm nowhere near as irritable or out of control feeling as before. An interesting paradigm shift has taken place though, and I'm wondering if anyone else has dealt with it, and how they did it.  Anyways, I now see people smoking and I get envious, like REALLY envious.  Here I am quitting smoking for a litany of reasons and now when I see someone smoke all I can think is, "How come they get to smoke and I don't?"  I mean come on, how stupid am I?  Bad enough I smoked for so many years, now that I've finally quit I'm going to turn around and get jealous of people killing themselves? I never cease to amaze myself... Anyone else feel like this?

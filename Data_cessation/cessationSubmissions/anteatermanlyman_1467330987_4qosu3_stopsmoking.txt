Yes! Urges are subsiding

This is about day 2, maybe 3 because I had some puffs of my vape but only a few then threw it away. Anyways, I'm so happy to be this far! I relapsed a while ago, and was so bummed about that. Hopefully I stay quit this time :).

Just FYI, the urges aren't completely gone, but omg the emotional rollercoaster I was having is. And all the urges that lasted for minutes at a time are gone, they last a few seconds now usually.

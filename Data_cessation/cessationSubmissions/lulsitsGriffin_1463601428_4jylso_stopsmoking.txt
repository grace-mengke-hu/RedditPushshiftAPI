RAWAHGHAHHGHRAHARHRRRRR

I'd rage IRL but I'd feel even worse because I hate when my neighbors are loud. 

Day... 3? for the umpteenth time. ugh. thanks for reading. 

one day at a time. solidarity!!!!!! lets keep at it folks.

edit: I have stumbled, the badgebot should update in a few. But I appreciate the kind words and support! Support groups have always felt a bit icky because I'm not used to genuine concern and support, but this internet style support is easier to swallow. I will definitely be sticking around!

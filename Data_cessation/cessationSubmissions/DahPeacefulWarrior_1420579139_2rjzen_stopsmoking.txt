I feel strong and happy

My new year's resolution is to live a healthy lifestyle, smoke-free . My last cig was on the first hours of january 1st. As clich√® as it may sound, I have been mentalizing this concept since october so Im pretty strong on that. My cousin quit smoking by that same method, he's been smoke-free for 5 years now.

Yesterday I had a drink with some friend, alcohol is a big trigger, but I managed it. I almost gave thought to it when this pretty hot ballerina chick started to smoke, hughe trigger, I didn't even consider it. I could talk to her without the urge to smoke. 

I felt strong and I feel happy I stood by that decision.  As for the girl, well she smelled pretty bad after the cigarrettes, so now Im more aware of how clean I smell now that I dont smoke.

This is awesome, I feel healthy.

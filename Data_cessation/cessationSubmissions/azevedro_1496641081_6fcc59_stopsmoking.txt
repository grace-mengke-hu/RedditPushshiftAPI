Is t normal to have a terrible flu and fever after quitting?

So I quit last Thursday. Just cold turkey stopped. I am quite casual, averaging 7 sticks per day. I quit because I found it was making me fall sick more often. Ironically, I quit and since yesterday I suddenly had a terrible fever. Like shivering from cold in the hot sun kind of fever, and an awful flu (non stop sneezing), sore throat, the works. I got rashes and my eczema flared up all over. 

Is it normal and how long does it last? It's quite ironic I quit because I kept falling sick, and now once I quit I fall sick.

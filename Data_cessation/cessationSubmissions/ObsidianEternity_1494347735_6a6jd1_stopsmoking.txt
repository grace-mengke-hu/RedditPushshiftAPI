Just about 3 Months in, still some wicked cravings

Anybody else feel em for that long?  I'm sure it's not a unique predicament, but man is it rough sometimes. I can go days with no problem, but then out of the blue it hits so hard I'm damn near willing to go find the nearest gross ass re-fry I can find on the ground and burn it up.  

Fortunately they're normally pretty short lived, but wowza can they be hard to cope with.

How did quitting smoking effect your looks?

I haven’t quit yet, but I’m curious as to how quitting effected looks. Did your skin get better? Did you gain weight? If so how much? Have you lost it? I’ve been smoking since I was 15, I am now almost 23. I want to quit but I’m scared of gaining weight ( bc I’ve lost a whole bunch) but I’ve noticed recently my skin isn’t what it used to be. If I quit now will I gain back the life in my skin? I’m currently at a half a pack to a pack a day. Any input would be awesome!

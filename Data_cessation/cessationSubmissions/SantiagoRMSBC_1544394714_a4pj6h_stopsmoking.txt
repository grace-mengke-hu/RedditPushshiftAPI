Go always cold turkey

You can do it! Here a helpful advise:
I smoke for 13 years an was clean over a year but fell back into addiction 2 years ago. Since then i had several tries to quit again but never reached a week without smoking since. Now i am on it again and today is day nr. 9 since my last one.

My first try and the one im doing right now were the most succesful ones and all the other tries (7 or so) were slow and step by step or without the right discipline. In all of those tries was the one cigarette after a few days without enough to fail. 

My most succesful ones had one simple rule i followed with discipline and highly motivated: NOT EVEN ONE. That is the simple difference between fail and success. I know that after a few hours/ days there seem to be a lot of reasons to smoke just one or two (get some sleep, stress, whatever) but all those reasons are bullshit. Stay fucking strong.

What is also helpful is to split the way into 
7 steps to quit:

1. Step: One day without smoking
2. Step: Three days without smoking
3. Step: One week without smoking
4. Step: ten days without smoking
5. Step: two weeks without smoking
6. Step: six weeks without smoking
7. Step: six month without smoking

Little successes inbetween keep you motivated. Stay strong guys! You will make it.

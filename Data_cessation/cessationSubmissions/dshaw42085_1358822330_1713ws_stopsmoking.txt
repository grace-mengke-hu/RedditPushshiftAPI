Day number 19. Having a bit of difficulty.

It has been fairly smooth sailing past the first week until today. I imagine it could be attributed to stress, but I don't really know. It's not even being able to justify it, I just want to say fuck it. My roommate smokes so it makes it easily accessible. I KNOW that if I have one, I will probably have another, and then another, but I still just want to say fuck it. Why?

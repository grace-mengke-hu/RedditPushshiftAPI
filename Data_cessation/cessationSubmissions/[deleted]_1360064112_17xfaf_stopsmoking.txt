Day one down, with e-cigs.

I would love to quit cold turkey, but i'm not in a position in my life at the moment where I can handle it, but after one day I know can definitely stick with e-cigs until i do quit! It makes me really happy to live in a time when technology can provide ingenius alternatives to our problems :)

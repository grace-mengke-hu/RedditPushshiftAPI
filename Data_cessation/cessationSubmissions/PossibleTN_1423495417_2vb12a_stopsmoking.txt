Starting over again today.

After one serious attempt (6 days) and a few half-ass attempts I've realized that relapsing does nothing but bring my confidence down and I end up mentally punishing myself for being weak.  The withdrawal is much more enjoyable than this self punishment and I am done.  I will not smoke today!

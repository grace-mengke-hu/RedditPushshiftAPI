Why did I quit?

It's been 6 days since I quit. I've read Allen Carr's book while quitting and I just feel like shit the fuck am I quitting for? I never wanted to quit. Its just because of the people around me that wanted me to quit. I am having really bad withdrawals right now but if you gave me a cigarette and asked me to smoke it, I wouldn't be able to because of Allen Carr's book. What the fuck do I do guys? I can't. I can't quit. I use smoking to kill time and enjoy coffee and breakfast. Why?

Really afraid of the depression phase

Hello guys! So for the 3rd time..I have decided to quit smokingtoday (sent in a request for the badge two days ago).. woke up this morning and I couldn't stop thinking of the depression phase that follows. I also have this habit of wanting to smoke right after my lunch - and i really crave for it every time. Would be great if somebody can help me with ways to overcome this dirty craving of mine and the depression phase

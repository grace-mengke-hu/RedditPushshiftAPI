90 days! It can be done!

This time a year ago, I would never have believed I'd make it this far. Any prior attempt at quitting consisted of me going a day, then grabbing a can of dip, snus or some other kind of tobacco, and eventually going back to smoking after about a week of "tapering off". In January I said I was done and committed to it.

Some noticeable perks:

* More money

* Weight gain (as a skinny guy, that's a plus)

* Improved sense of taste/smell


* Improved focus

* Better sleep

* Increased productivity (no need for smoke breaks)

* Improved self-confidence (If I can do this, I can do anything)

I am addicted to the feeling of pride that comes with being able to say "no" to cigarettes and my own brain's cravings. For those of you in those agonizing first few days: stick with it, it will only get easier. To those of you still having the dreams: be grateful. That feeling of shame upon waking gives you a little taste of relapse would be like. We've all decided to do an incredibly difficult thing here, and we all have the strength to see it through. Keep it up, non-smokers! The struggle will end soon, and it will have been worth it all.

Looking for "just one" stories

I'm almost four months in (my longest cold-turkey, no cheat quit in memory). 

I'm also in my last semester of graduate school, first semester teaching my own course section of research methods, and very new to another job. I'm also a newlywed and mom to four kids. Recently, I've been hit with serious anxiety from all angles recently- from social anxiety, to imposter syndrome, to work/life balance issues. This may be the most stressful time of my life, and I have started to revert back to thinking "I need a cigarette".

This morning I held an unlit cigarette and sucked on it like the good old days while I vented to my husband. I decided against lighting it and picking up the stink before work. It wasn't hard to walk away from it, but probably only because I convinced myself that I'll start smoking again later (when it's more convenient/ I don't have to worry about my intellectual reputation/ I'm not working in a role supporting families/ I can take a shower right away).

I need reminders that if I go home and have "just one" it'll be many more. Also helpful would be input from longer term quitters.

I almost forgot about you /r/stopsmoking

Wow, it's been a while. I stumbled across this reddit while doing the /r/random thing today and realized my flair was still counting. Posting to say that my 456 days is going to keep going as I'll never pick up a cigarette again.

I've had almost nothing but positives since doing it, and I'll admit there is one negative: Since getting my sense of smell back (took about 6 months to really come back) I can smell my co-workers bad coffee and smoke breath now. I'll just avoid the close talkers.

For those still smoking, you've taken the first step by coming here. All that's left is for you to put the cigarette down. For those just starting, keep up the good work. We know how hard it is, but it's worth it.

Cheers, /r/stopsmoking and thanks for the support.

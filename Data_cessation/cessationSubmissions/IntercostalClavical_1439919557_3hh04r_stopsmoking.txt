Wellbutrin and Habitrol?

My doctor put me on 150mg/day Wellbutrin for a week, then I went up to 300mg, plus started the 21mg Habitrol patch. Seems to be pretty effective so far. I've only had mild cravings a couple of times. It's only been a week but I'm feeling great and think it's going to work for me. Anybody else have experience with this combo?

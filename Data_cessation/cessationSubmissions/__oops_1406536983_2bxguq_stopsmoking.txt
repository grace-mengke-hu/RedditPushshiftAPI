How the f*ck can I cope when my so is a bitch?

As you can tell by the title I'm just starting to quit. My wife thinks it should be easy peasy if I REALLY want to. She is honestly the reason I keep failing to quit. "When was the last time that you smoked?" "Have you smoked today?" "I'm so proud of you for not smoking!" "I can't believe you had one cigarette!" It all makes me want to go buy a pack!  I switched to an ecig and it cut my normal cig Intake to 10%of what it has been for the past ten years and when she asked how long it'd be until I quit the ecig I told her I honestly didn't know. She got that dumb bitch look on her face and said "well that's dumb if you're just hopping from one addiction to another." She honestly makes me wish I had the ability to strangle a person (her.) she was born to addicts and raised by addicts until she was fostered into the state and I figured she of all people would have the most compassion towards an addict trying to quit but all I keep getting is bitchslapped about how stupid I am for being an addict! How do you deal with people like this? Sorry for my vent session.

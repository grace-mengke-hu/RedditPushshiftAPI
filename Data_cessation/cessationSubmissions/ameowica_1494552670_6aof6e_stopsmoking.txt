HIMYM: Last Cigarette Episode

So I'm sitting at home, binge watching How I Met Your Mother and the "Last Cigarette" episode comes on. I'm seriously laughing so hard and it's making the whole process easier. I've been craving one all night and this is definitely helping remind me of the negatives. I would highly recommend watching it if you're looking for some laughs during a difficult time.

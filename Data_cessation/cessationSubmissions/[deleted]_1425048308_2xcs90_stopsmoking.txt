Quitting with an (0 nicotine) E-cig?

Around two days ago now (technically one day as of posting) i decided to quit smoking. I have gone relatively cold turkey and am using an e-cig with 0 nicotine juice. I was wondering if anyone else had any experience quitting this way? 

It hasn't been to difficult so far and that is what concerns me. I feel that because it is so easy i may be accidentally substituting cigarettes for an e-ciggy and becoming addicted to it (even though it has no nicotine).

It hasn't been very long i know but i would really like your opinions on the whole situation. 

P.S by relatively cold turkey i mean that i have not had a single intake of nicotine since i quit but i have still been sort of feeding the habit by using by 0 nic e-cig.

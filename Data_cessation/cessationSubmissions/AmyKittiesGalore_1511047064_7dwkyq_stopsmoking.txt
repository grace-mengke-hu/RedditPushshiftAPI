I can smell the trees!

Today I took my morning walk through the park that I walk through every morning. Only today I noticed the gorgeous smell of the trees, it was like a fruity piney fresh smell and it was amazing! I took a deep lungful of the crisp fragrant fall air and thanked my lucky stars that I have escaped the nicotine trap.

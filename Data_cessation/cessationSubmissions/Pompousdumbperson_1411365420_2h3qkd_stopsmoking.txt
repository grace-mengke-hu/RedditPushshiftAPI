Smoking doesn't even look cool

It's such a classic image and it's floated around by pop culture and popular discussion. I'm 19 and I started smoking in high school partly because I wasn't very cool and I'm sure at least a part of me figured they would help. 

Everyone kind of hates people who smoke, though. I don't think it's real loathing, but rather people rightfully find it repulsive. I smell like an ashtray, I couch and hack all the time, I have the energy of an old man, and I look rather pitiful compulsively participating in a habit that makes me die. 

Now, I'm not mired in self-pity. I know that people are able to acknowledge superficial flaws in others and still see value. There are good things about me and I'm at least a little bit cooler than when I started smoking; in some ways at least. If I have ever looked cool while smoking a cigarette, though, it would be like looking cool while driving a minivan. It's either unrelated to or; more likely, in spite of the fact that you are driving a minivan.

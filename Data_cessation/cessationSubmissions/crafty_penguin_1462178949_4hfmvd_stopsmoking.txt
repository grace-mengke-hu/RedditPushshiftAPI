Flight as good start to quit smoking

Hello! I smoked for 13 years. On the midnight of 27 April I was determined to quit.

I had to leave Samui on the 29 april evening and I was going to spend around a 24 hours in different airports and planes. You can't smoke in plane and sometimes you can't smoke in airport too. What a horrible event for a smoker! What a great chance!

So I got drunk to achieve the worst hangover ever. It helped me to not think about cigarettes until the evening. In the evening I was refreshed and feel so good! I was never so fresh when I was smoker. I went to airport.

It was the most delightful flight in my life, it was most delightful quitting in my life too.

And still I have some pleasant dizziness because I'm full of oxygen now :-) It was so depressing when I was always tired and stale when I was smoking.

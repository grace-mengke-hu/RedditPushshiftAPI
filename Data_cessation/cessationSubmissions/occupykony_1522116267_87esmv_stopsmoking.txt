Can we get some stories of quitting benefits?

I'm 72 hours into my quit at the moment and really curious about everyone's best benefits they've had from quitting, especially in the first few weeks. I'm really hoping to sleep better and to have more energy. Also feeling quite lackluster, unmotivated/depressed the past two days; guess it should pass soon? Came down with a gross cough and am hacking up lots of phlegm since I've quit but excited to get through this as well.

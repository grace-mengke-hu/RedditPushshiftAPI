Got my "1" badge!

I am using the patch, and listening to Easy Way on audiobook during my daily commute. It has not been nearly as hard as it was when I tried in the past, going cold turkey. Still, I've had times when I was grumpy, and times when I had cravings, but I just tell myself that smoking is not a thing I do anymore. I can't wait to be done with the patch, and all of it, for good!

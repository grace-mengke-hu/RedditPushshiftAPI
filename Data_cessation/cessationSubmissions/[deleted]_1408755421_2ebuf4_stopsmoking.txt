One year.

Crazy to think it's been a year, now. I remember, vividly, the three month mark, the six month mark, counting time by the "how your body heals when you quit" posters. Everyone around me still smokes. I still think about times when it would be nice to have one, but mostly in the context of something to do, rather than something I *need*.

Y'all are awesome. If it's day one. If it's day 1000. If you're me, out there lurking, not quite ready today. If I can do it, anyone can.

Cheers y'all. Thanks for being a great community.

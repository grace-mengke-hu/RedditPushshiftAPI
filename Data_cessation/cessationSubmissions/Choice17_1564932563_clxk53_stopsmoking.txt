Coffee on table outside cafe.

I used to frequent this cafe when I was a smoker
Today after 3 months I felt confident enough to sit outside in the sun near an ashtray.
Ugh craving but  managed to deal with it.
I then went into a shop the lady in front of me smelt of smoke , that made me so ashamed I used to smell like that. I felt so glad I didnâ€™t give in .
When a smoker you have no idea you stink.
Keep strong and quitting however challenging.

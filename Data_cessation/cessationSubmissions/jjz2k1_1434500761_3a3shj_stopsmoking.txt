1 month 19 days

Today is my month and 19 days of quitting smoking. I was a smoker for 9 years at the age of 16. I finally decided to quit because it was a goal I had in my head that once I finished university I will quit smoking once and for all. I'm actually quite happy that I've quit. I took a vacation to Paris and London and this was a mental ability to deal with smoking because here, everyone smokes like crazy. Especially when I went to Paris. Still in London at the moment and I'm glad I made it through that journey. I am proud I have quit!

What did it for me

I was determined to stop smoking and I knew that I was ready to not have this stupid need to consume a product that was expensive and fucked with my health.

But I just kept taking the last cigarette, there would go days maybe, between the lasts. I knew that I wanted nicotine, but maybe I could break my want for a cigarette.

So what I needed to do was associate repulsion with cigarettes, I did this by smoking the lasts for longer than usual, and as soon as I would get too deep into the cigarette, I would get a feeling of disgust, almost retching.

When I had this repulsive feeling I held on to it, let it live it's full course, noticed the way I felt and put out the cigarette, with the good-riddancey 
feeling of disgust you get when you throw out food that has gone way too bad.

By the second cigarette, I would get a mild feeling of disgust when I reached for the pack cigarettes, the feeling would intensify when I put the cigarette in my mouth, and be damn near puking when I smoked the cigarette again for too long.

I had one or two more after that, with the feeling of disgust intensifying by the cigarette. And what I found now was that I couldn't think about a cigarette without getting physically disgusted, and boy, does that make it easier to not fucking take one.

8 months later, it's the same fucking feeling I get if I imagine smoking a cigarette, I just get disgusted. No nostalgia, only disgust.

**Disclaimer:**
I know this is probably super fucking unhealthy for you, so don't do this shit if you're not honest with yourself, if you're not sure you're on your lasts, don't do it, too many of these will fucking kill you quicker than your current path.

My argument here is that a couple of these are not that bad in the grand scheme of things.

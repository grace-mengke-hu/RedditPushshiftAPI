I can't quit

Tomorrow I'm turning 31. I've been pack/day for about 12 years now. Longest I ever quit was for 3 months. I don't like smoking, none of my friends smoke (other than an occasional drunk cig bummed off me), my health is worsening, I enjoy exercise and am excited to do more, and I really want to never smoke again. Every time I've tried to quit in the past few months I start the app at that last one of the night so when I wake up I already have 8 hours of being nicotine free. The cravings are so much that at lunch I go out and buy a pack then try again in a week or two.

I don't know what that first step is to make it stick. Everything else seems to be in order other than dealing with cravings. Help?

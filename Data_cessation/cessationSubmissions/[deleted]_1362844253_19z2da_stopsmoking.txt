Starting to lose confidence in myself.

I've been trying to quit for over a year. My friend has been able to quit cold turkey. I've tried patches, gum, cold turkey, e-cigs. I keep losing self-control. 
EDIT: Thanks so much for the support everyone. I'm getting that Allen Carr book from the library on Monday and am not going to give up. I'll let you all know how everything goes. Thanks again!

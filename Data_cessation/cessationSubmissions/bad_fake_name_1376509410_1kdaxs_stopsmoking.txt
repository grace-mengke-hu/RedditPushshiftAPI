After a couple false starts, here we go. (intro)

Howdy there.  I'm bad_fake_name, and I quit smoking as of this morning (again).

I just finished Allen Carr's book and already I am aware of a huge change in how I'm approaching this compared to past attempts.  It's a great system so far.

On the advice front, does anyone have any words of wisdom to share about quitting smoking while your spouse is still smoking?

I'm not going to pressure my wife to quit because I know from experience that just leads to bad places for both sides.  I suggested she read the book and see what she thinks, and that I hope she quits, but that's as far as I will go.  If she decides to, I'll be elated to help her.

Unfortunately that means that I have to quit with a very loving source of cigarettes nearby.  Following a suggestion I saw here earlier, I'll tell her to slap me if I try to charm one out of her.  We already don't smoke in the house so that's good.

Does anyone have suggestions other than that?

Tips for staying on track

Hey there,

I’ve been a smoker for 6 years and have been seriously wanting to quit. The thought of quitting is scary, even though I’m not sure what I’m exactly scared about. 

I wanted to know from y’all what are some personal tips for quitting- what can I do to stay accountable and on tract. 
-also, I work in a restaurant where cigarettes are as common as pens. Andddd the fiancé smokes as well. 

Thanx for share if your stories and insights ✨

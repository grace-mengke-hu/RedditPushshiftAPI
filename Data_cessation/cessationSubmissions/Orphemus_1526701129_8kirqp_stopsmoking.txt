1y3m in. i almost never crave anymore, but..

.. I really, truly miss cigarettes.  I miss the sense of emotional stability they gave, the contentment, the routine.  I dont always feel this way but nights like tonight.  A little disappointed in feeling this way after this long, anyone else feel similarly?

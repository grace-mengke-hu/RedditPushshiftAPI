My App says it's Day 9

So far it's been 216 hours without a smoke. Thank god I've got the app. I couldn't remember for how many days I hadn't touched a cig. Totally love it to wake up in the morning and not feeling like a trainwreck. In the latest past before quitting I always felt the urge to vomit when waking up because I felt that sick because of the cigarettes. So yeah, I already went out with the boys and had some drinks without even wanting to smoke. Right now everything is good.

What is it that drives you guys to play hard and stick with the attitude to quit? Sorry for bad grammar.

Max.

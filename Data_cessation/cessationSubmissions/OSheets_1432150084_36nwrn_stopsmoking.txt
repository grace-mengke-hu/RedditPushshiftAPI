Starting!

Hey guys I have been smoking for about 5 years, gradually smoking more more. I smoke tobacco so I get through a 12.5g pack over the course of 1 week. Not exactly how much that is to be precise.

I want to stop smoking because I am shallow, I am a male and take pride in how I look, sadly I dislike it when I see a female smoke.. it is not something that I would hold agaisnt another, it is just something I dislike the image of if you can understand what I am trying to say? 
I've read many internet posts regarding the process how it effects your body at each stage etc..
I was wondering if anyone can give me their personal story on the process of quitting...e.g What did you do to fill that habbit (I smoke alot when i'm on the computer, playing games, avoiding awkward social interaction, especially after a big meal and when I wake up) 

Few things I want to know though are:
What did others do to fill the time they were smoking (what habbit, what worked etc..Last time I tried quitting which was years ago I ended up getting addicted to soya milk to quench the crave which was insanely weird)
Does the craving stop? If so when? I understand and have been told the first 1-3 weeks are the hardest... Or is that wrong?
Just basically I want a heads up on how i'm going to feel for the first 1-3 weeks So im mentally prepared

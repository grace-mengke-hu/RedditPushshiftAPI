Advice on quitting

Tl;dr I want to quit smoking, but the last time I tried went horribly. I don’t know what to do.

I’m 21 years old and have been using tobacco products since I was 15. The past 3 years it has been only vapes. I have wanted to quit for quite some time now, but I have found that everything I was told about nicotine being addictive was NO lie. I currently use a vape with the same amount of nicotine as a juul. I actually prefer to only use it at around 25mg. The best I have ever done with “quitting” has been lowering my nicotine 12mg for a little and then stopping fully for about a week and a half.. when I did this it was awful, my grades suffered, going to work was torture, I found myself horribly stressed (I usually don’t stress easily at all) and irritated and even very depressed during this time and also isolated myself a lot more. Makes me feel like quitting at where I’m at in life is not ideal if I want to keep my job, my good grades, and my mental sanity and social life.. I thought maybe taking a month off of “life” next summer or when I graduate and dedicate it entirely to quitting might be the best move. But I would love some advice here.

A smoke for every occasion...no more.

I used to think that I smoked just because I was stressed. And when I'm under a lot of stress it puts a lot of pressure on my ability to keep cravings at bay. But today I was incredibly successful in completing a project after staying up for 11 hours working on it. In the flood of excitement and accomplishment, I felt like I could really use a celebratory cigarette. I just think its amazing how nicotine tricks you into thinking every occasion is a good time for a cigarette. I didn't cave, because I know better now. But damn, what a powerfully addictive substance.

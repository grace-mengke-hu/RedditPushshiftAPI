Everything you know about quitting is wrong.

Just wanted to give back to the community a bit.

I know this sub forum is for cigarette smokers, I definitely smoked, but vaped and dipped more often. I know Cigs are more addictive than E cigs and Smokeless tobacco, however I still feel these tips can come in handy.

#1 Don’t throw away your Cigs. Ever. The simple reason is this. You aren’t going to be able to avoid Cigarettes. Sure, you can avoid popular smoking areas, but you can never completely avoid them. They’re in Gas Stations. They’re in public. They’re in your friends hands. They’re on the ground. By throwing away your Cigs you’re not helping yourself. All you’re doing is making it more likely that you’ll cave in later, because you haven’t been trained to deal with situations where Cigs are easily accessible.

#2 It’s no secret saving money is a big incentive to quit smoking. But I feel most smokers go about this wrong. They have a counter on their phone, or just manually calculate how much money they’re saying by not smoking. Not effective. Let’s say you spend $6 a day on Cigs. On day two you have saved $12. You know that is true, but your brain tries to rationalize it. You start thinking “oh it’s really not that much money”. What you need to do it spoil yourself. Go out to eat. Go out with friends. Buy yourself gifts. That way you actually see the  economical benefit of quitting smoking.

#3 When you get to the point where you would feel guilty if you smoked a Cig, you’ve made it. There is no reason you should relapse at this stage. Why? Because you wouldn’t even enjoy a Cig if you smoked one. Even while you’re smoking all you’d be thinking about is how you just fucked up all your hard work

#4 Quit Caffeine. Caffeine is a trigger, and increases anxiety, especially when you’re goin through withdraws. Withdraws also make you tired, so it’s best to take advantage of that and sleep off as much of the withdraws as you can, so avoid caffeine at all costs.

Calling all Catholic-ish quitters!

I'm not a bible thumper, by any means. Am pretty much an Easter and Christmas church go-er. But, by God, when I'm driving (which is the worst time for me!)and get a craving, I grab my rosary! Takes about 15 minutes to say one, you keep your fingers busy with the beads, and I'll be darned if God doesn't reward me by getting me past my craving! Win-win? Indeed. Keep going all... we've got this!

Went a whole day with absolutely nothing this last weekend

Hi guys!

Just a quick story here, so this weekend I spent a lot of time with a close friend of mine, and for an entire day and a half I completely forgot I'd ever smoked - didn't smoke my e-cig or use any other kind of quitting aid, I guess I was so busy it didn't even cross my mind!

Just hoping I can maybe inspire some of you here :)

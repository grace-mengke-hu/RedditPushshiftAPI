I need someone to talk me down right now.

I failed two university classes this semester. I have no real excuses, I just performed poorly. My parents just took me out to dinner to tell me how disappointed they were. I tried to explain that I've been a bit off lately, but that I'd recover (this has never happened before). They told me I should consider dropping out.

I don't want to, and moving home sounds fucking awful. 

I feel like typing this has just made me more upset. Please help. 

Edit: thanks for the support guys. I went out and bought a pack... resisted for a good amount of time, around an hour, but I just couldn't handle it. I'm back on hour one, but I threw the pack away. Life is rough, but smoking is still fucking stupid. Have a good one. :)

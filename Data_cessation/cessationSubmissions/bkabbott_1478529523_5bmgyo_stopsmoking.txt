Coming off Chantix abruptly

My quit date was 26 days ago. This is my fourth day after stopping Chantix abruptly. 

The first few days I was off of Chantix I had mild cravings that passed me quickly.

Today I am craving cigarettes more severely and it's not really going away.

I was wondering can I expect this to get worse (because if it does I may have to get back on Chantix). Also was wondering if this is just the Chantix getting out of my system and if it will subside within a few days.

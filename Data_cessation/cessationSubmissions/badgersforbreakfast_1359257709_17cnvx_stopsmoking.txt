Oh poop, feel very disappointed at the moment...

I had gone 16 days without a cigarette! Tonight however, I went for a night out in Manchester and ended up smoking three cigarettes. 
Wasn't even drunk, just was meeting new people and felt stressed so I cracked. Pathetic. 
Now I have a crazy headache, my mouth feels bad and I feel ashamed! 
Oh no. Feels bad man!

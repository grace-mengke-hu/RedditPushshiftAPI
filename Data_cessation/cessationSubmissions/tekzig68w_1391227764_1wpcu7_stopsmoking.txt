I just don't know

I have been smoking for 4-5 years now. I either started at 13 or 14. I am now 18 years old. I can feel the affects of smoking, mainly when it comes to running. I have tried to quit a few times and I always end up right back where I was. I tell myself I need to quit but I can't find the motivation. What motivated all of you guys?

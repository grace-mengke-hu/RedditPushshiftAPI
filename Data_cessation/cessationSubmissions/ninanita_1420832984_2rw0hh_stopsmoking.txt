hardest time while studying

It's now 3 weeks that I have managed not to smoke! I survived christmas, new years eve and even my birthday! I am really proud of myself and happy, but now that the holidays are over I need to do a lot of studying.. and that's the most I have missed smoking. some help? how can i handle university-stress without the cigs?? (I know cigarettes don't actually help with stress, but somehow it had always felt that way..)

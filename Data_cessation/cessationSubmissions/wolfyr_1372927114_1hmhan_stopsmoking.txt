Getting cravings AFTER a month. Is this normal?

I stopped smoking on 4th of May this year, and didn't go through severe withdrawals, and everything was fine the first two weeks. A month later, I've suddenly started craving cigarettes. Very strong, very urgent cravings. Haven't given in to the impulse yet, but it's getting too much. Is this normal? I've not depended on anything to quit. Just quit cold turkey. I'm afraid I might just pick one up next time I'm drinking or something. Please help.

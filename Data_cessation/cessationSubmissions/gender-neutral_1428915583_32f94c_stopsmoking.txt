My process of quitting took 2 years, but I stuck.

I never expected this day to actually come, and it has! **It's been 5 days since I quit.** (Feels great, feels like I quit a year ago, no cravings yet!) Maybe this could help someone else who's looking for a positive but long story :) Here's a quick summary of everything that I have to thank for this day to have happened.  
  
**Why did it take me so long?** Other than the fact that quitting is hard on some level, I am a stubborn, lazy person, and am easily de-motivated by failure. Trying to keep at my process of quitting, with the backdrop of these qualities, was just harder.
  
I(age:25) used to smoke **~12** a day, 2 years ago. I had non-smoking roommates who were all into fitness, so I started going to the gym with them. Also because I was chubby and wasn't doing anything in the evenings.  

I had to cut it down to **8** because the trainer said not to smoke for at least 3 hours before coming to the gym. Fine, I agreed because he clearly showed me how my strength and stamina were poor. 
  
Brought it down to **5** myself, after a few months of gym, because I got interested in fitness and wanted to focus on losing weight/getting fit. I was finally able to stop reaching out for my morning smoke as soon as I woke up, so I could go to the gym in the morning. 
  
2 of those 5 cigs were smoked in the evening. I joined evening yoga, because, again, bored in the evenings and who doesn't like being more flexible and patient and all that?  
  
This brought it down to **3**- After gym smoke, mid-day smoke, after yoga smoke. There was finally a number I could not cut down because I couldn't teach myself that gym and yoga CAN still be fun without the smoking "reward", and that the mid-day "stress" was induced by the craving and not real-life. So, I started reading Allen Carr's Easyway. The insight into a smoker, smoking and tobacco the book provides, was exactly what I needed to help myself understand why I need to let go. Without finishing the book even, I'd finally begun to get disgusted by the cig to a level of being able to hold back. Then one weekend I got piss drunk and smoked away an entire pack(I've read on this sub long ago this helps if you're on the verge of quitting). That was enough to push me over. The next morning, I went to the gym, went through the day, went through the next day, didn't smoke. I needed to feel as disgusted as I could, that's why the unhealthy weekend smoking.  
  
And NOW is when the *QuitNow!* app helped(again, found on this sub). Because every morning, even though I don't have the cravings now(the farther you are from your last smoke, the lesser you crave the next one.), the app shows me how many days I've gone without smoking, how much time and money I've saved. It feels like someone is paying me to not smoke now, when I look at the app everyday, and that makes me feel good(in addition to not smoking making me feel good already). It also shows you the health benefits that are being added to you, each day that you go without smoking. For ex. My CO and O2 levels are back to normal, it says now.  
  

So yeah, I'm just really excited to finally be able to experience all the benefits I've been reading about for a long time now. Better sense of smell and taste and not getting stressed thinking about my next smoke. Never having to worry about my nice clothes smelling of smoke. And of course, all the little health benefits.. Good luck to you!

Why is it this afternoon out of no where that I am having craving after craving?

So for the past little bit my cravings have been going through the roof seeming to be that I am having one craving after another. I am able to combat them. It is more they are just a plain pain in the butt. Just needed somewhere to vent instead of caving into my cravings and going to buy a pack.

I need help &amp; tips!

So I really need to quit smoking. But I'm also afraid that the stress of quitting coupled with the other major stressors in my life currently, there are a ton lately, will make it super difficult and/or only make me more stressed and unable to quit.

I'm also worried that the process of quitting will fuck up my breastmilk supply (no need to scold me for smoking &amp; breastfeeding, I already know and want to quit)

Any tips/ideas/advice on how to quit successfully &amp; manage my stress, along with the inevitable quitting-stress I'm going to have on top of all that?
 
(BTW I quit during my pregnancy but shortly thereafter started again because of horrendous family stress-inducing insanity)

Post-smoking obsessions

My newest obsession is things that smell! I have always been able to smell things, but now everything smells so much better. 
I just got from the store and brought home a MASSIVE candle with "sea-smell", bubble mint bubblegum, and deodorant (even though I already have one) that smells like pomegranate and lemon. It's so nice!

Do you guys have any obsession like this since you quit smoking?

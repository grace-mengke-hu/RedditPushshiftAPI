Let the games begin...

I quit on Tuesday.  I picked up the habit while I was deployed, and fooled myself into the thinking that I would quit when I came home.  That was almost 2 years ago.  So I made the decision to just stop.  So far so good.  I'm feeling good, the cravings aren't too bad, and I'm going through a whole lot of sunflower seeds.

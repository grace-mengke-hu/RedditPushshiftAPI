Another starter

My fianc√©e and I were at the bus stop last night, smoking. We were talking about the cost of a pack of cigs, and then we started coughing. I looked at the lit cig and then at her, and we decided right then to quit. We snuffed the unfinished cigs. 

I'm happy with our choice. We're in our mid-20s, and we want to be healthier. 

I'm worried though. We live in Russia, and it's impossible to avoid being around smoking. A number of our friends do, plus the social drinking+smoking culture is so prevalent that I fear the temptation will be great. 

I'd love to remove myself from these social situations but these people are my close friends, and, as an ex-pat here, I really value having these people in my life. 

So, wish us luck. Any advice anyone could offer would be greatly appreciated.

Seeing young quitters on this subreddit

Don't get me wrong, age is meaningless when it comes to quiting. Whatever your age, if you're deciding to quit then I'm right behind you, but it is really refreshing to see how many people in their 20's, 30's and younger are on this subreddit quitting. 

I'm genuinely glad that people at a young age are kicking it in and not waiting till their health deteriorates. Keep going strong!

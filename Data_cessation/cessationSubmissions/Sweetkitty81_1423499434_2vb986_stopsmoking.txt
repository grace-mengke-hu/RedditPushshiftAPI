6 days 13 hours

So my little smoke free ap tells me that helpwise i am doing better. 

So i had a little victory yesterday. It use to be that when i got together with family i would be itching for a cig the whole time. Yesterday: big family get together. Didnt even think about smoking. 

The morning coffee is still hard.

A check in.

10 months clean of cigarettes, 5 months clean of nicotine.

I have almost no cravings whatsoever. I think about cigarettes a few times a day (when I see others smoking, a passing thought, some memory, etc), but rarely are they positive, longing thoughts. Usually they are down right negative. My lungs are now capable of great things. My sense of smell and taste have improved significantly. I feel no sense of something missing or something good having been taken away from me. Smoking for ten years was the stupidest thing I've done. Quitting was a great choice. It was hard at first, but got much easier as time went on, and now it almost effortless. 

The advise I offer to anyone whose looking for advice is to avoid, at all cost, romanticizing smoking. Do not to let yourself think about smoking in a positive way. Even if you are completely confident that you will no succumb at that moment, you perpetuate the myth in your brain that smoking adds to the value of your life. That is the crow bar prying open your resolve to not smoke. You need to stay in control.
Always keep in mind the following: 
Your life is not better with cigarettes. It is worse. There is a chemical dependency which has a powerful effect on your psychology. It tricks you into thinking cigarettes add to your life so that you will put more of the chemicals in. Do not be fooled. Cigarettes degrade your body and mind, and ultimately, they will kill you.

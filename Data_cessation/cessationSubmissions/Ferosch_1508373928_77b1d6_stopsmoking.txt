I've started eating and drinking unhealthy since quitting the smokes

It's been two months since my last cig and it's really come down to vaping, eating and drinking. Yeah, it's my own damn fault but the cigs made me basically a skeleton, functioning almost purely on smokes, coffee and noodles&amp;tuna. 

I feel like an assburger eating so much and I supplement the occasional cravings with alcohol. It's not that bad atm but I do recognize an arising problem here.

I dunno what to do about - scrap that,  I'd need to replace my habits with something healthier but it's tough. At the moment just hope I won't relapse.

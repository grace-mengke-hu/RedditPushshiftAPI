5 days in and smoked a cigarette

Only about 1/3rd of it before i threw it away, i'm not sure how i should feel about this. It didn't feel like anything special and i realized that cigarettes doesn't make me feel good, but that it only makes the craving for a cigarette go away. Did i fuck up? As in how big of consequences does this have for my brain?

Just started out of an impulse any advice?

He everyone,

I just quit smoking after 15 years of a pack a day with some time smoke free but not that much. I initally planned to quit when I tuirn 30 but today it dawned on me why wait? 

I just wanted to ask for any advice small tricks that helped you personally to quit smoking. As I quit in a rush I fear I might not be prepared for what lies ahead. 

Thanks in advance. 

P.S: This post is also made to make it harder for me to start again as I kinda made m quitting prospect official.

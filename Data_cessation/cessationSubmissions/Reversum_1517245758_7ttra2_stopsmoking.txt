I failed. And now I'm starting over.

A little over one month ago I posted here that stopping smoking had increased my stamina big time. I also said that I was sure that I would never touch a cigarette ever again. I meant that.

After a month of not smoking, I thought it was over: I wasn't thinking about cigarettes anymore and I was more productive than ever before. I stopped checking this sub and stopped reading about stopping smoking: I succeeded!

The 38th day was de day that I lighted a cigarette. I was drunk and didn't really think it through. The first cigarette wasn't good at all, but O My God, did I want another cigarette an hour later. I bought a pack and have smoked for the 10 days since.

I didn't want to face that I failed, didn't think about it. That works in the short term, but eventually, you have to face that you're a smoker again. Today was that day for me. I threw away the 10 cigarettes I had left an hour ago and right now I really feel the need to write this down. 

38 days are down the drain and I now have to go through these 38 days again. My findings from 10 days of smoking again: I'm more tired during the day. I can't get up in the morning and my stamina is back where it was before I quit.


**Please, if you think your addiction is over: it isn't.** Please don't make the mistake that I made and don't stop reading this sub, don't stop reading about the advantages of quitting and don't stop talking about it with family and friends.

Well, I had to get that off my chest. Here we go again. I hope this time it will be easier, but if it isn't: Let's go for it. I've been here before.

EDIT: I just want to thank you all for your amazing replies. Everyone is so incredibly supportive and that really means a lot to me.

grad school bound and stress smoking

Hey guys!

So I have a big problem with turning to smoking cigs during prolonged and stressful situations (i.e. finals or projects).

I don't smoke regularly and when the stressful situation stops, I'm done smoking until the next stressful event (which can be weeks or months in between).

Therefore, I don't think nicotine is the only reason I do it. I look at harming myself with cigarettes as an appropriate response to what I think are "all or nothing" stressful situations. 

It seems a bit masochistic, but I'm having a hard time finding an alternative. I've tried deep breathing and stress balls, but I'm really having a hard time beating that little voice that says, "Go smoke a cigarette. Who cares?" when I'm under pressure. 

I'm about to head off to grad school for my biochem PhD and I know stressful situations are only going to get more and more frequent and my habit can lead me down a dark road. 

Does anyone have some advice?

Do you seriously want to ?

Sounds a little weird perhaps but, after 44 years of  heavy smoking and every kind of quit smoking book, plaster, gum, snuff , inhaler (yes, you can snort liquid nicotine), hypnosis, etc. in the book  the thing that has finally got me here (quit 12 days ago) was as simple as finally deciding that I don't like coughing and not being able to breathe clearly and smelling bad and living for the next cig and wondering where and when that's going to be. I simply, finally got my brain to realise that I really don't like smoking and it's consequences and don't want to be a smoker. After that...  it was easy to quit  cold turkey (and I was a 1.5 - 2 packs a day guy). So...  it's only day 12 but I feel  zero problems so far (but am reminding myself every day and reading this blog and following a good stop smoking app' and have given up alcohol for a few weeks all so that I keep at the front of  my mind that I really, seriously want to stay off the cigs and enjoy a healthy life). Good luck to all out there. If I can do it (after "failing"  [or learning] 100 times then you can too!).

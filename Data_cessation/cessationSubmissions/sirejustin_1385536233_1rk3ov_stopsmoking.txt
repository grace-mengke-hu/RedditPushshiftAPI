Just over 2 years without!

Wow. Looking back I am glad I made this decision and never thought I would be here right now. Thanks all. And if this is day one for you stay with it. I still remember my last cigarette. Thinking well this is it, no turning back. Looks like I stuck with it. Good luck folks.

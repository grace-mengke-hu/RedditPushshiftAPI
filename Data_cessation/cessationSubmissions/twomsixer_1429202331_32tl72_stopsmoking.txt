I just want to throw a little a PSA out there on choosing a method that works for you...

It sometimes seems like the popular opinion on this subreddit is Alan Carr's EasyWay is the best method to quit, and nicotine supplements don't work (something Alan Carr preaches in his method).

Maybe his method works for 90% of people (or 97%, I think he claims in his book), but it's important to find something that works for you, and ultimately I think that has to do with finding out why you smoke to begin with, and why you want to quit. I've quit probably 7 or 8 times in last 3 years. I've tried the EasyWay method (going cold turkey) 3 of those times, twice with the book, and finally trying the video. I never lasted more than 4 days that way. I've tried slowly cutting down on cigarettes, that never worked either. Personally, I've found the patches to work the best for me. I think my addiction was 50/50 Habit/Chemical Dependance. It was too hard for me to defeat both of them at the same time. The patches allowed me to break the habit first, and by the time I was out of patches, I no longer associated the act of smoking a cigarette with different events (drinking, driving, post-dinner, phone calls, etc.). With the habit broke, the occasional nicotine cravings were much easier to resist. 

Anyway, I guess what I want people to take away from this, is don't be discouraged if something that works for the majority of the population doesn't work for you.

12 year smoker, and I can't do this anymore

I know every other post is one of these (been lurking for a few weeks), but I need to do my own. I can't smoke anymore. After a dozen years smoking a pack a day I have a chronic cough, my voice is raspy, my breath shallow and I'm exceedingly lethargic. I just turned 30 and every other part of my life besides personal health is looking up and moving forward. I want quit so that I can feel better physically and also because if I can do that, I can do anything. 

I need some people to talk me through it and to whom I can feel somewhat accountable (I'm aware that I'm ultimately the only one that can change). 

I have three cigarettes left. Gonna rewatch the Allen Carr video now. 

Thanks guys

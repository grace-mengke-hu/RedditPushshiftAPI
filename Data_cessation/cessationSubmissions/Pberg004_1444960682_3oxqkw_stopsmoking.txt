New to all of this ðŸ˜Š

I never thought I would join something like this for motivation and support, but WOW! It's so amazing to see the support on here and all those who have worked so hard to stay smoke free! I've tried to quit so many times before, but this time feels different and I'm open to anything to keep me on track and away from the cigs! Kudos to everyone on here working towards being a non-smoker.  I will be going in to day 5 tomorrow and couldn't feel better about it. Good luck everyone!!!

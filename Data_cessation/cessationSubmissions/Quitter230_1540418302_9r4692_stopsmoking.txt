22 days and counting

Today make 22 days since I've smoked my last Newport! The pros since I've quit are:

1. I have more energy 
2. I don't wake up feeling like I've slept with a cinder block on my chest 
3. My dental hygiene feels SO much better 
4. I feel like I have Much more time throughout the day 
5. I have saved about $80 in less than a month. 

There have been a few days where quitting seemed impossible and temptation almost got the best of me. Reading about what smoking does to our bodies and the health risks has helped me tremendously. Stay educated, care about yourself more than your habit, remember the good will ALWAYS outweigh the bad!! stay strong 💪🏼

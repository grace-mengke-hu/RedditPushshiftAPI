Has anyone had an experience with hypnosis?

Hey guys! I'm trying to quit smoking again and I'm curious to know whether any of you have had an experience with hypnosis (smoking or otherwise) ? I feel like I've tried just about everything and it's only backfired on me. When I tried the NRT gum (on multiple occasions) I ended up with blisters all over my gums (gross, I know, sorry!) the patches were near the same, they burned my skin and left rashes, the e-cig did actually work for a while there but I feel it's still in line with an addiction. So, here I am with my curiosity of hypnosis and whether it really works or not?

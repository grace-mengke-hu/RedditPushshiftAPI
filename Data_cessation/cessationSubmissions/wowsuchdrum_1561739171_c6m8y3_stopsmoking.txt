Cravings significantly reduced after 3 days?

Hi all, I quit 3.5 days ago as of right now. The first two days SUCKED something fierce. Probably the most mentally challenging thing I've endured for a LONG time. But yesterday and today it's like a switch was flipped and I barely crave at all. It's like after those two days of hell it is all over.

I anticipated the hard cravings lasting much longer, which is why it took me so long to quit. But wow, not so bad.

Others probably have a different experience, but I did want to see if others had a similar experience to mine?

Best to all of you, not one more puff!

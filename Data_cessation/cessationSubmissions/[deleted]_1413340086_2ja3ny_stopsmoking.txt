The addiction devil is tugging at me

It's a constant state of tug-o-war with this addiction. Especially when things get rough. I can feel it pulling at me saying "come on, you know one cigarette will make you feel better". Then I respond with "shut up! no it won't! It will only make things worse!" I hate feeling this way. I wish it would go away. As easier as it has gotten to deal with situations like this, it does not mean that it still does not happen. Life is full of ups and downs and that's just a part of it. The fact that an addiction is added into the mix does not make these "down" situations any easier to handle. Addiction is scary and it never really truly goes away. You just keep fighting and fighting, because addiction is weakness. And I am stronger than that.

22 days tobacco free, but put on almost 10 pounds?

First time poster! Here is my issue, after about 1000 attempts to quit I finally made it past withdrawls and cravings... BUT I went from 189-198 1/2 lbs.

I read onine before I quit that tobacco cessation can cause weight gain but I didnt think it would happen on such an extreme level. I took precautions to avoid food as an alternative and have stuck to a workout routine of 1 hour of biking 3 days/week. I havent been eating worse (if anything I'm eating better) 

Am I doing something wrong? Will my weight bounce back down after some time?

tl;dr Quit 3 weeks ago, started working out, put on 10 pounds... Help?

Fighting the Muscle Memory / Physical Aspect

I've read that women especially but people in general tend to struggle with (beyond nicotine dependancy) not having the physical act of smoking. Of course there is a chemical addiction but if it were as simple as that, we could all quit by suckling on nicotine lozenges. I am looking for ideas for overcoming the emotional addiction, the muscle memory, something physical. Does anyone have any ideas for how to deal with those urgeres?
I'm thinking of the urge to smoke whenever I'm in the car, or watching TV/reading, or when I need a break from work or from people so I use going outside as an excuse. Does anyone have any thoughts about how to redirect that urge to "do something"??

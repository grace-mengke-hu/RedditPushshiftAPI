Craving Help

I'm almost to 21 days, and I'm sitting at work unattended with access to cigarettes. I haven't been in this position before and the craving is overwhelming. They almost disappeared and I thought I was over the hump but this has been 15 minutes so far of desperate craving. I don't know what to do. I can't remove myself from the situation and I'm about to break down. Help

I quit 5 weeks ago and it feels strangely easy

I am no longer a smoker, I decided 5 weeks ago I would quit. I did ,2 days later I had a cigarette and it was horrible. I had a headache, my toes were tingling, I got dizzy so as any smoker would do, I finished my smoke. 

I threw my smokes out the window and haven't looked back. It has been strangely easy, I am not meaning to take the hard yards out that others may have faced but simply as a PSA that unless you try; you'll never know. 2 years ago, I quit for 2 weeks and it was the hardest two weeks. Every moment my mind wandered from the task at hand it went straight to smokes. So after 2 weeks I broke. I always thought I would quit one day, I'll just need too really want to quit. There was a bit of me that wanted to smoke. 

So 5 weeks ago, I went away for the weekend with limited cash but left my smokes in the car before leaving to fly. I decided I'd just not smoke over the weekend. After a day, I decided I'd take leaving them behind as a sign and quit. So I did. That s my story, as long winded as it was, I really an glad I quit smoking. 

One last note, don't let weight loss get you worried and become a factor in deciding to quit. I haven't put on any weight, I have just stayed active, eaten relatively healthy and not over eaten.

Stale smoke smell

Have been smoking nearly 2 thirds of my life, im 34, Iv tried giving up many times but failed.  

Tried cold turkey, nicorette gum, patch's, E cigerettes, the lot. 

Was starting to think that hypno therapy might be my only choice but the thoughts of someone messing with my head like that was putting me off.

A lot of people i work with were using vapor cigerettes and i wanted to try but at over 100 euro start up cost that put me off... untill i was offered one for 50 euro.
  

I said feck it il try it.
  
That was a week ago today.

i went from smoking 30+ a day to 5. but today... my gawd.. the smell.. it stinks.. i mean it FUCKING stinks rotten, i can now finally smell what non smokers smell. STALE SMOKE. it VIAL. my gawd how did i or anybody put up with it for so long.

I cant even get away from it because its on my clothes from the little few i had today.


I dont ever want to smell that stink again.

When does the smell of others smoking becomes gross and not tempting?

I've just quit a couple of days ago with the help of Tabex (modern day miracle!). But someone was smoking outside my window and I smelled it and it was tempting unfortunately. I wonder at what point the temptation goes away and tobacco becomes repulsive.

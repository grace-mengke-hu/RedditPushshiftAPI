The bright side

Late afternoon on the 1st I came down with a nasty stomach bug. Couldn’t eat anything (or at least couldn’t keep anything down) for four days. It was about a week later that I was finally feeling better. Looking at the bright side of things, I felt so bad that I had no desire to go outside for a smoke during that time. And by the time I felt better I was (theoretically) over the physical addiction and decided to try to keep on going. 

There’s still a day left but thus far this September I’ve smoked seven cigarettes and five of those were on the 1st before I started feeling sick. A helluva lot better than my usual half-a-pack-to-a-pack a day for the last 35 years!

Long Time Lurker. Just Had To Post A Couple Things.

Hi. I've been lurking here for 6 months, and since the day I discovered this subreddit, I've been trying to quit. In my previous 6 attempts, I didn't even get past 3 days. On a daily basis, I used to smoke half a pack a day, mostly during work to "relieve stress" or at parties, and I started smoking even more recently to deal with the horrible incidents that have happened in my life this year. I know it's only been 10 days, but this has been my greatest go at it. 

The first couple of days were wild and my mood swings were out of this world, but something changed. They're gone. Just poof, out of the blue. The need to smoke a cigarette during every break and lunch is no longer there, and best of all, [I can smell again!](http://i.imgur.com/GdLz64f.gif) Seriously, smelling simple ordinary things again gives me such a pleasant feeling, along with better breathing and smelling better myself. I have had a couple random ass dreams, though, which I don't really mind, but for now I'm happy.

Like I said, I've only stopped smoking for ten days, but I can honestly say that I never plan on going back (knocks on wood). Reading a lot of the posts in here has helped me stay motivated to quit: the ones where you guys help out and give advice to people who are on the verge of smoking again, the success and progress stories are what keep me going. So I just wanted to say thanks for every word that's been written in this sub. I've really applied a couple things to help me out and keep me motivated. Thank you. And now to lose weight and try to quit energy drinks. Cheers!

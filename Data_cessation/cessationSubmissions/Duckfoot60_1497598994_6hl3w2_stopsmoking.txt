Day4

So, you would think I would know better really, wouldn't you? 
I am 45,have had cancer and work in healthcare, yet still I got sucked back into smoking after coming out of hospital last year. A couple of celebratory drinks led to 'just one' cigarette, which then escalated and before I knew it I was back on 10 a day! 
I'm now 4 days into my first attempt to seriously quit. The app is helping, I like seeing how much I'm saving,how my body is recovering etc. It's tough but I'm determined! Hell,if I can get through 5 lots of chemo I can get through this!!!

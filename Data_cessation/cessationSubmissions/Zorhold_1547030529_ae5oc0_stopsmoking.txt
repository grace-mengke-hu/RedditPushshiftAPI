Coffee can be a real bitch

I'm on hour 46, just woke up and had my first coffee alone since stopping. WOW, I was NOT prepared for a craving that hard, apparently my brain had made the strongest connection between nicotine and caffeine.

But: I didn't give in, i didn't throw out the coffee, i didn't stop drinking it. For the first time, I actually welcomed the craving. I continued enjoying my coffee, while the nicotine monster raged in my head trying to get my attention. But guess what? 

My morning coffee is MINE. Not the cigarette's. And I WILL keep it, the addiction will have to get used to it. Felt so good to not be a slave to nicotine this time, but to fight back, just by laughing in its face and going "Haha, oh, THIS? Yeah, you can't have that. It's mine, and it never actually was yours."

Keep strong, guys and gals, my support to all of you! Maybe my approach of beating mental connections to things we enjoy can help somebody who struggles with that. Remember these are YOUR hobbies. How would you react if somebody constantly barged in on you when you're reading your favourite book? You'd tell him to piss off. Do the same for smoking.

I love you, peeps. ‚ù§

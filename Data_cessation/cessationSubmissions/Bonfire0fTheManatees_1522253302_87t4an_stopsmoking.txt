One month as a non-smoker!

I smoked my last cigarette on February 27, so while it's a short month, today is my first month! This had become my longest quit and unlike the last time I stopped for a month, this time I don't feel like I'm just trying to prove something to myself or like a smoker who's denying myselfâ€”I feel like a non-smoker!

The biggest difference is that I'm on Wellbutrin this time and I know it doesn't work for a lot of people, but it's really working for me. Plus I really needed to start an antidepressant... Between that, lots of exercise, the Smoke Free app, and reading posts here, I'm feeling supported and committed to a new life as a non-smoker. 

I'm extra proud because I'm a teacher and just spent a week grading final essays; I started teaching when I was already a heavy smoker and had NEVER spent more than an hour grading without chain-smoking the whole way through. That's one of the excuses I used to make: I can't quit because I wouldn't be able to survive three grading weeks a year. So proud and relieved to get through it without much struggle!

We've all got this! Thanks for the support and I'm cheering for all y'all!

Almost 12 hours in on I don't even know what attempt...

I'm basically scared to get off the couch. I'm not tired yet but want to go to bed so I don't "accidentally" run off to the store to buy a pack.

I've read Carr's book a few times, I'm on the patch, I've got Nicorette spray, and I HATE smoking. And yet, I feel like I'd do just about anything to escape these cravings. 

I still have a sense of humour, though. It's just dark and twisted right now.

I believe I can get through this. I almost have no other choice. At least the wife was smart enough to vacate the area for a while so I don't bring her down. 

Also, I'm not actually sure whether I'm craving a cigarette or a joint. One addiction is just as good as another, though, right?

Now I'm rambling just to give my fingers something to do...

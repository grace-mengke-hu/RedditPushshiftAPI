A few days in, is it really worth it?

Ive quit for a few days now, and the psychological side is the one that has always been the hardest for me. Ive only been smoking about a year and a half (Im in my 20s) so the physiological aspect isnt too bad. I know in the long run it is in my best interest to quit, but the consequences for smoking seem so far away that Im having a hard time justifying staying smoke free. Does it get any easier from here?

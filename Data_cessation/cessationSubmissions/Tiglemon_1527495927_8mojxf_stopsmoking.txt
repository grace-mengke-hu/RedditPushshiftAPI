5 days up, yay!

Ive been a smoker for 12 year now. I've tried so many times over the past few years to quit. 

Funny, this time I feel like it's final. I also realize I may need to reach out to others in the process, as my husband is also a heavy smoker and I don't see that being helpful at this time for me. ( I think it's the quitting but I got super irritated with him :D) 

I noticed I'm bit Moody and cribby even angry. I hope the rhythm of thinking comes back to being pleasant. 

Well, I'm not much of an online person. This is the first ever group chat group I've joined. Let alone posted on :) nite I'm waiting to see the number next to my name steadily go up! 

Thanks to all who have built this beautiful community.

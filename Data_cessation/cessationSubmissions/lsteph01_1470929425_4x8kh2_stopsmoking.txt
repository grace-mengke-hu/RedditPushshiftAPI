101 Days! Some thoughts!

This sub has helped me tremendously and I want to thank this community for all the support. Quick story, I recently had the pleasure of being at a bar with a friend when we were both offered a cigarette. For the first time I was the guy waiting on them to come back , when I have always been the guy outside. I sat there thinking to myself holy shit, I really don't want a cigarette. It was weird and liberating at the same time. It took me about 6 attempts ( after I discovered this sub ) to actually stick to it this time, so never give up and if you fall, own up to it and start again. It is fully worth it!!

Motivation

Day number 11 of not smoking.  Im finally not losomg my mind and it's an awesome feeling.  It's all a mindset on how to quit.  I've tried multiple times to quit but I've always failed until now.

You can quit if you want to.  It might take a couple of tries but you can do it.  You just have to make it through the fist week of hell.  Once you beat it you beat it.  Let's work together to try and say as many lives as we can including yours.

We will always be here to help and you can always share.

Keep strong and let's kick this ass together.

Your friends,
Life

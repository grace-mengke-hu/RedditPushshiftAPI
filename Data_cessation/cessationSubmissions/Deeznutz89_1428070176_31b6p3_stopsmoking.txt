Can't find the motivation to stop smoking since a bad break up. Advice?

So a few weeks back my boyfriend and I decided it was time to quit smoking. It was a piece of cake for me..not so much for him. Eventually he was doing really great and it was good for both of us. We recently broke up.. Or at least I think we did.. And I started smoking again. I feel like if I try to quit now I will be even more stressed with everything that is going on. I also can't get the idea out of my head that we were going to quit together.. So if we aren't together why should I quit? I need some help!

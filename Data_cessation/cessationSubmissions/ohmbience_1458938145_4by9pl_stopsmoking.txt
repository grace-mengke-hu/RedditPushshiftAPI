Today, I begin the journey to becoming a non-smoker.

I've been a smoker for 20 years now. Over the last 10, I've tried numerous times to quit. Patches? Tried them. Gum? Didn't work. Lozenges? They worked out the best for me, but still didn't put a stop to it. Every time, I've been surrounded by people saying, "You won't quit," "You can't quit," etc. 

This time is it. I got with my doctor and got a prescription for Chantix. I got added to my state's cessation support network. And I picked (I believe) a great day for day 1 - my birthday. I'll be turning 35 on Thursday, which will be the last day I smoke. 

PROS

I'll be saving about 50 bucks a week.

I won't have to go outside in shitty weather to get my fix.

I won't have the constant congestion and coughing during and after smoking.

I'll smell better.

I'll (hopefully) be around for many years to come.

I won't be contributing to the acceleration of my own demise.

I'll be able to run and hike and hunt without getting out of breath on the first hill.

CONS

Uh...well, there really aren't any.


It's serious this time. I'm done. My family deserves it. I deserve it.

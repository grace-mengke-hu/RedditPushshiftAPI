Just broke rest of the death sticks. Starting smart Turkey.

Hi Reditters,

Had posted a week ago that I want to quit smoking.kept on reading all the posts here on this /r/ .
Reading your posts has given me a confidence.
I know the cigarettes give no positives at all.
They only restore the nicotine levels.

They have been messing up big time with My skin, my stamina, my family time, my routine,
In fact every part of my life.
I deny to be their slave anymore.

I CAN handle the empty restless feeling by a glass of cold water and deep breathing.
No need to take another puff.

Thanks a lot for all your posts.
Wish me luck.

Spent the whole weekend around chain smokers and stayed strong, even when I was drinking. You can do this, too!

Just a few months ago, I wouldn't have thought I could ever quit.  I'm over 100 days now and spent the whole weekend around my SO and his family.  He and his mother chain smoke.  I live with my SO but that hasn't caused much in the way of temptation because he doesn't smoke around me.  This time I sat at a table with them while they chain smoked AND I was drinking.  

But I stayed strong!  Not bragging here guys, I had been a smoker for 14 years and genuinely didn't think this would be possible.  I'm proud of myself and dang it, I deserve to be.  

Oddly enough, the best part is that I woke up with a sore throat because of all the secondhand smoke, which was just a big reminder of how shitty I felt all the time when I smoked.

10 days and 3 hours

Hey hey everybody.  I was a pack a day smoker since I was 17. Started for an older girl and ironically enough 90% of my relationships that followed were with people that hated the habbit.  I am 30 now and I made up my mind 10 days ago because my wife can give birth any moment. My son deserves a dad that is healthy and will be around for a while.

10 days in I can honestly say it feels amazing.

Today is day 3

Today is the beginning of day three!!!

It's worth mentioning that I've also laid down the pot...so no smoke inhalation at all.

Things I've noticed:

- a ton of time that I don't know what to do with!!
- fidgety in the afternoon (about 3pm is when the cravings are the worst)
- people don't give a fuck ... one even said "good! You aren't smoking! You're an adult and you shouldn't be smoking. Please pass the bread."
- I've found myself putting off a few other priorities in light of focusing on choosing health and wellness.
- I like to say (often and aloud) that I am choosing health and wellness instead of quitting smoking.
- I'm wasting shit boats of time browsing reddit/HN/fb to kill time...I don't usually do that
- I had trouble falling asleep but was sound asleep all night.
- I'm alone in this fight apart from this Reddit group and my dog. I live and work alone.

More will come to me in sure, but now it's off to walk the dog and breath fresh air!!!

Thank you all so much for the support!!! It means the world to me.

Made my first week in 6 years

I did it! Got through a full week! I feel great despite the insomnia! Today is my real test though. I return to work in a high stress environment after a week off. I would have always smoked in the car to/from work and taken smoke breaks as we do not get a lunch break. I'm hoping my bag of candies and checking in here will get me through. This sub has helped me so much.

it's been one day and i'm

about to go BRAZY! bad crazy. i don't smoke cigs anymore, i transferred to juul and everything was amazing - i didn't smell, my teeth looked great, people didn't judge me, etc., and i figured i'd eventually wean myself off juul. well, the juul spirits made that decision for me and my baby died two nights ago, and i've been hitting a friends yesterday, and this is the first day i've gone without fully. i didn't even realize how much i used it just as a nervous habit, or to feel sexier, or whatever! fill the anxious void. i even smoked two blunts, which all that did was make me hungry and then grumpy at how much money i spent on that versus a juul.

please help! i know i'm a weakling cause it's the first day, but i didn't even chose this, it just happened and i'm trying to ride it! &lt;3

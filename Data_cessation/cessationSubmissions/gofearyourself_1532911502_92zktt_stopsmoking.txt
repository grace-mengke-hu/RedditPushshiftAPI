How do I quit ?

Hi everyone. I'm 26 years old. I've been smoking for the past 6 years. I've tried more than 40 times to stop but everytime I fall back into this bad habit. Can you please help me on how can I stop smoking for good ? 
The most difficult thing for me is getting up without a cigarette.
Thank you so much.

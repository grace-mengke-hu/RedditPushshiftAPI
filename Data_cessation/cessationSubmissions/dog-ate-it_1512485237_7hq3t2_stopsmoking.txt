Reasons

The Quit Experts say to write them down, so write them down I did

1. Sleep. I never sleep more than four hours. Wake up horking up loogies and having a nic fit.

2. Horking up loogies 24/7. 

3. Lethargy. After my last relapse, I guess I just surrendered to smoking. I didn't do doodly squat this past summer and it was mostly because of smoking

4. I rarely "feel good". 

5. My beard stinks. Hair is a smoke stench magnet and when it is directly under your nose, um yeah

6. My jackets stink. 

7. $$$$$$$

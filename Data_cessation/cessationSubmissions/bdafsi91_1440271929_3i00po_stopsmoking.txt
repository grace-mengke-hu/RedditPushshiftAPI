How to remove smoke from a home?

We are in the home inspection period  and saw a home that had a smoker. The living level smells some, but the basement a lot. The walls in one of the rooms in the basement has imprints of the tar(?) around the photo frames etc. 

I am not looking for general advice, but if you have accomplished to remove smoke smell, please let me know.

Thanks.

I don't count my days.

I've been smoking for 8 years. It's crazy how much time has passed while I was that stupid.

I don't know when I quit. It was about 1 week ago I think.  If I start counting the days, Ive noticed alot of people want to become addicted to quitting smoking. " I havent smoked in 2 years 3 months 1 week 1 day and 11 hours!!!".   Just seems more time occupying than quitting and forgetting.

I might be different. I've been going cold turkey and have had very few, light cravings so far.  And my lungs have been on detox this whole time. I'm spitting up the grossest black shit I've seen. Can't believe it's all been stuck in my body for that long, hacking  up tar is enough for me to not pick up a cig again. 

Of course my addiction isn't the same or as strong as others. And it's a proud feeling knowing how far you've gone without. But maybe there's something to just not thinking about how long you've gone without. And just living to create new neuro-pathways.

Just a thought.

Keep those lungs fresh :)

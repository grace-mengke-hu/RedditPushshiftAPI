I stopped smoking 3 days ago and feel fantastic about it. However, I can hear my blood pumping in my ear??

I noticed that shortly after my last cigarette (12 - 16 hours) I have been able to hear my blood pumping my my left ear since. I compressed that side of my neck near what I assume are arteries, and the sound stops. But as soon as I let go it comes right back. Has this happened to anyone else? I like to think it's related to the smoking because that's the only thing that has changed. Stopped cold turkey, with no nicotine substitutes.

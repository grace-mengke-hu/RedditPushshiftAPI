Been about 8 months. I got sick with a lung infection last week and I couldn't believe how much tar has come out.

I should probably have taken some pictures for the more curious of ya'll. I can still do that since i'm coughing up so much if anyone is curious. It blows my mind that 8 months later I'm still putting out a ton of tar. It tells me I severely underestimated how much damage i did to my body.

Recently I did a few things

A) Saw a postural restoration therapist and due to a poorly habituated CNS I havent been breathing right so working on this has opened the bottom part of my lungs.
B) Got sick, refused antiobiotics for a few reasons but one of them was to keep the cough going for as long as possible to flush the lungs.
C) Running. Occasionally after a run i will spit up a thick ball of mucous and tar. Its wild. These are usually the densest of the tar balls.
D) Sauna seems to help too but doesnt directly cause me to cough more.


I remember trying to get into running 5 years ago, then it was my lungs that held me back. Now its my knees and back. Oh how i wish i had quit when i was younger. Trying to get in shape in your 30's kinda sucks. Oh well. I'm alive and i'm grateful!

STOP SMOKING. YOU CAN DO IT. THERE IS A WORLD OF HEALTH JUST WAITING FOR YOU TO TAKE STEPS TOWARDS.

Thanks for listening to my rambling.

48 hours in

I'll just keep updating until i reach the 14 days mark (sorry mods). I feel like i have the need to share the following days. I feel much better than yesterday. I'm already starting to inhale and exhale deeper and slower. After doing cardio and weightlifting i start coughing like a maniac. A little more food cravings, but i'm following a high fiber diet so i'm able to suppress them. Better sleep. Overall i feel much happier. Imagine how low my dopamine levels have been yesterday, if i feel so good today.

Tips/Advice on not smoking during social events and drinking alcohol?

I am a pretty social person, but when I'm at social events and things get boring, or I just don't really want to be in the room with people and continue the conversation/situation I'm in, I used to use a cigarette as an escape from it. On a related note, I also have always associated alcohol with cigarettes, and drinking is actually how I first started smoking. I was wondering if anyone had some advice or tips on how to combat the urge to smoke during social situations and/or while drinking alcohol? Any and all comments would be appreciated, thank you.

7 days -starting to give into the thoughts

so I made it 7 days without a smoke. my main reason for doing it is because i have a synus infection and I was following a treatment.but today i found i actually need a small surgery for this so i feel like i quit for nothing.i mean i feel so much better in terms of energy and taste and smell. but i am at home,getting bored and wanting to smoke. I know i shouldn't but I feel like ..why should i quit now? i can quit later..help!

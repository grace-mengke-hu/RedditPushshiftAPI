Getting rid of the brain fog

It's been about 3 days since I quit. Quitting cigarettes hasn't been particularly difficult, I just try to keep myself busy with work or entertainment or distractions and it has worked out for me. The only issue I face is with the brain fog, the severe lack of concentration that comes up very soon after quitting. I dealt with it on the weekend, but my job demands a lot of attentiveness, needs my mind to be sharp enough and able to juggle multiple things across the day.

I really need help or tips with the issue with concentration. I have read in a few places that it takes about a month for this to go away, so I was thinking about taking some time off using the leave I have earned so far. I really want to quit (and I believe I can) but at the same time I need to keep it up at work.

I am quitting this job and starting with another in May, and I really want to keep performing at this one and the next. Apart from taking time off before starting the next job, any ideas on how to cope with the concentration issue? I've thought about having 1 cig in the middle of the day to keep my focus going, but I don't want to as I will end up buying a pack.

I cannot just soldier on through it because I am too slow to do any meaningful work. I'm even open to a temporary patch fix till I get my focus and concentration again.

Thank you.

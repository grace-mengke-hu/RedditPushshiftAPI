Should I reset my badge? :(

In a moment of extreme weakness, I succumbed and fell prey to the greatest seductress of all. After going Smober for about 24 days and odd, I smoked a cigarette today. I am not sure if this will lead back into a full blown relapse. But, as I type this, I feel as though I have let myself down. The original trigger <a personal situation> remains as bad as it was. Only thing that I managed by smoking this one cigarette was to make things even harder for myself. :(
EDIT: I reset the badge and have started off again. As RomusLupos mentioned - I am not letting this bump in the road impact my journey. Many thanks guys for all your support and insights.

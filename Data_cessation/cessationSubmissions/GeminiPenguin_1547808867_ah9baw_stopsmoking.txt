4 days into my quit

This isn’t my first attempt. I’ve quit for a month before, but went back to it. Though that time was different. I knew I’d break eventually. Like I had that thought in my mind and it stuck there and I made it happen. Now this time feels different. I know I’m done. When cravings hit it’s not about wanting one. It’s about wanting the cravings to stop. Just wanting this period to be over and to feel like myself again. I’m using the gum and plan on sticking to the 12 week program. I’m just wondering how long it’ll be until I feel like myself again.

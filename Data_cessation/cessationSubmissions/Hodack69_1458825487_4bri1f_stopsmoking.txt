13 days smoke free but now struggling with anxiety

Is this normal?? I have been a smoker for 32 years, but yay I quit 13 days ago. I am having anxiety and struggling with being forgetful. I'm hoping this all gets better. I have also gained 3lbs already and I haven't changed my diet. Please share your experience on this. I am hoping to get back to the gym soon but right now just trying to keep my regular schedule together. I'm ready to be healthy and have fun in life that smoking will no longer be an issue. So I'm just waiting for this anxiety to get a little better so I can start adding things like the gym to my schedule. Help! Is this all to be expected??

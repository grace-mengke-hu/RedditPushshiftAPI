When Does It Get Better?

I started taking Chantix near the beginning of June. My quit date was the 15th. It's been 3 weeks or so since I quit. I have taken a puff here and there, and I've smoked a total of 4 cigarettes. Still much better than the pack or pack and a half that I was smoking before. 

But it's still hard. The physical cravings are greatly diminished, thanks to this medicine, and I do want to quit, but I still have mental cravings fairly often. 

When does it ever get easier or better? I almost feel like I was happier as a smoker.

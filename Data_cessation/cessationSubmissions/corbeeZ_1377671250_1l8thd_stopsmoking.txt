Smoked my last cig just now. Last attempt at quitting. Advice/Motivation would be great!

 Hey everyone, I've been smoking fairly regularly since I was about 15 and I'm 24 now. I never really took the time to think about how long I've been smoking until recently. I know that 9 years is not a whole lot compared to some of you, but the years add on fast especially since I started out kind of young.

  I have tried to quit maybe 7 times over the last 5 years. Once I went a full 9 months without a cig (I'm a male, so it had nothing to do with pregnancy, just a coincidence), but then one night I went out drinking and decided to buy a pack. Then it was back to square one. I have even tried Chantix once!

  Today, my friends, I hereby declare that I am going to stop smoking permanently even if that means I cant drink anymore, and I look to all of you for motivation. I have read a lot of threads on this subreddit and I really enjoy this community and I'm glad to be a part of it.

  My main goals are: to quit smoking (obviously), get physically more healthy and maintain, I even kind of want to become vegetarian but only  one step at a tie. I want to be able to run for miles like I used to.

 sorry if this is a long post. thanks for reading and good luck to all of you.

  It's going to feel great getting out of these chains!

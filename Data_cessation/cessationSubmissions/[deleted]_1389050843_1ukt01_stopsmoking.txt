Long term quitters: Did your emphysema/COPD improve?

Hi All,

I'm going to try and take the plunge... again. I just had a question. After 25 years of smoking, I now have a really bad smokers cough. Although I haven't been diagnosed, I'm fairly certain I have emphysema or COPD now. As of this year, I've started to use a steroid inhaler to help breathing.

I know it's not something that can be cured or healed. But, I was just wondering if anyone out there had emphysema or COPD when they quit and if you saw any improvement in the coughing, breathing and ability to move without getting winded so easily.

Thanks in advance.

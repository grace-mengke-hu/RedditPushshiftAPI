I've had my ups and downs this month, and I'm down at the moment.

Went to Vegas this weekend, decided to allow myself one cigarette (at the end of the weekend, so I didn't fall completely off the wagon with no hope of getting back on). I didn't have one. Not one. I brought a vape pen, with 0 mg nicotine for emergency puffing, and it helped immensely.  
  
But I still **WANTED** one. The casinos smelled terrible, the smoke was choking me, it was all pretty nasty, but I still WANTED ONE SO BAD. And I've carried that want with me back home. All day I've been struggling. And part of me thinks it's the stubborn ass part of my brain saying "You can't tell me what I can and can't do." It's been eating at me these whole 20 days- the withdrawal wasn't fun, but bearable. I just want my brain to shut up, and I can't seem to get over this hump. Doesn't help that boyfriend, also quitting, has already failed three times and keeps buying packs. It's killing me. I've read dozens of posts and articles on this sub and it's not working. HELP PLZ. I just want this feeling to go away.

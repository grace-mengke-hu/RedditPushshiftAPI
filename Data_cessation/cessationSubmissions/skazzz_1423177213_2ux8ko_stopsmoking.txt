Eating stressing me out badly.

Hey guys so I'm 70 hours in, and I'm doing really well except for one thing: after I eat I get really, really bad cravings that last for hours. I'm fine up until I eat, in a decent mood all things considered, exercising every day, but a sandwich for lunch and I just plummet into irritability and nerves. Has anyone else dealt with this? How did you handle it?

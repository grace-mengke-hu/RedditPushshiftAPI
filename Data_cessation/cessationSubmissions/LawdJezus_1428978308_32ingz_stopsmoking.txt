Where did the time go?

A year? A YEAR? 

I know that everybody's experiences are going to be a bit different, but I reached a point where I went stretches without thinking about cigarettes. They crossed my mind mostly when I saw someone smoking, but it wasn't the incessant nagging cravings (both physical and psychological) that you get in the beginning. So for those of you just starting, it gets better. Just keep on keeping on.

Also, you've heard it all before, but before quitting, I started exercising more and it's been a huge help! Bicycling to be specific. The high I get from finishing a 20 mile ride is a million times better that any feeling that I could have gotten from a cigarette. It's a win-win!

Good luck to everyone!
Keep you stick on the ice

Help me convince my sister to stop smoking

I recently discovered my 16-year-old sister picked up smoking this summer. My cousin, who is 22, smokes and gives her cigs when she asks. I've found a pack of cigarettes in her purse. I don't know the extent of her addiction, but I really don't want this to continue. We've lost 3/4 grandparents to cigarettes, one of them from 2nd hand smoke alone. As far as I'm concerned, if you're in my family and you smoke, you *will* get lung cancer. I've tried telling this to her but she's so stubborn. I understand it's her life and her choice, but I don't think I could live with myself if she gets cancer a few decades down the road and I missed my chance to nip it in the bud. She says she does it to relieve stress, but I'm sure there are plenty of better, safer ways to do that. Both of us are avid weed smokers. Please give me advice on videos to show or things to say to get her to understand that nothing good will ever come from smoking. 

Thanks!

Dreams.

Do you think the dreams you have on NRT are the dreams one normally has, only we remember them?!?  If so, dreams are fucked up. 

I had a dream last night I was in some kind of junkie den and ended up with a whole-lotta-heroin. Then met my high school friend and scored some oxy from him.

I've never done heroin nor oxy and never been in a junkie den. wtf? 

Had another dream the other night about a workplace I used to work at mroe than 2 years ago, and quitting there, and leaving on bad terms?! 

Then there's weird sex dreams and monotonous work dreams. .. . . . .

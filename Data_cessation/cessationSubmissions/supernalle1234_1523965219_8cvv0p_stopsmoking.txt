Day 16. Anxious and depressed wreck.

Reading through a lot of posts shows that I'm not alone in this. But damn, it feels like most people have a tough time for the first few days only.

I'm sitting here feeling like death over 2 weeks in. It has not been like this constantly, but certainly most days are not anywhere near good.

Anyone else feeling like me a few weeks in?

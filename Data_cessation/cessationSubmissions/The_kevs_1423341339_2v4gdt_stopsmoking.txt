Today I finally woke up

I have been a smoker for 6 years and smoke about a pack a day. I have had a ridiculous amount of attempts to quit and always failed. I normally got to day 3 and the mood swings and anger took over. I had great reasons for quitting, but the main reason was never because I wanted to. I tried to quit because my nephew was being born or because my girlfriend's kid saw a smoker and said it smelled like me. There are many many similar examples, but all of these failed. 

So yesterday I go out to have a smoke. I have a balcony that overlooks a very small yard and I dont have an ashtray (because having one would make me a "real" smoker) so I always throw the butta off the balcony. My roommate told me there were numerous butts in the front yard and if I could clean them up. I obliged and thats when the horror started. 1 hour later of being on my hands and knees filling an entire grocery bag of cigarette butts everything hit me. First a hard wave of nausea and then the realization that this is just a sliver of what I have put in my body, this is money I have literally thrown away. This was not me or who I wanted to be. I threw the pack away and am 23.5 hours into quitting. I am using a vaporizer because many cold turkey quits have not worked. I am getting a badge today and am ready for this journey. 

Tldr: Spent an hour filling an entire grocery bag with cigarette butts by my smoking spot at home. I am a non smoker because I finally made the choice, no one else.

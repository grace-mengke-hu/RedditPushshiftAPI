I'm kinda proud... even though I messed up

so before last Saturday night, I had 43 days not smoking.  I was doing great and feeling great.  Then the monster got me while drinking at a bachelorette party, drunk me said "those look tasty".  I had two that night.  In the past that would have screwed me and by Sunday afternoon I would have had a pack.  Instead, Sunday afternoon was filled with guilt about messing up.  

Though this week, I've had stronger cravings than I have in the last month, after Sunday I just told myself I messed up and to keep on going.  I'm still a non-smoker :)  that feels pretty damn good.  reminding myself of everything I read from y'all certainly helped my mentality this time I think.  So thanks guys and stay strong!

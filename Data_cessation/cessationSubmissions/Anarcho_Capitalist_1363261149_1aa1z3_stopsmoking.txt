Day three. Hell day.

I am only 8 hours away from making it out of day three. The hardest day. I quit for seven months about two years ago and then started again because I'm a fucking moron. I could talk about how much yesterday sucked but I don't want to. I want to talk about how awesome today is going to be, because in only about 8 hours my body will theoretically be free of nicotine and for the next 19 days my brain will begin to restructure itself to live a live without it. Thats right. I've like done the science on this shit.  

Edit - Making it happen so far. On my way home I was negotiating with myself on buying a pack and only smoking one or two a day but I didn't do it. I do not have time to reply to everyone so I just up vote all of you. Thanx for the kind words. I have gone 73 hours now without any nicotine so its all downhill from this point, but still will be very difficult for about the next three weeks. Depending on the person for those who don't know, it takes three days to get clean and then three weeks for your brain to restructure itself in a way where it does not really on nicotine for anything. after about three weeks the only addiction one could possibly have is physiological. Not to say thats not a big deal. it is and I have been there. Every time you do something or go somewhere that you haven't been or done sense you quit you will have a small craving. Not a real craving like I'm having today or you do when you smoke, just a small suggestion in the back of your mind. My grate grandfather who quit smoking in the 50s lived to be 85 and died I think around the year 2000, anyway he said he wanted a smoke from time to time. 50 YEARS LATER. Now im just rambling.

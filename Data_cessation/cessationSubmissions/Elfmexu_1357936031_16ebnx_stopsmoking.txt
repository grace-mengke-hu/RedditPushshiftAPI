it has been 2 months...

its been so long i already forgot the taste of a smoke. i can hardly remember the feeling of smoking. yet i still crave it sometimes. my mind keeps trying to rationalize it: if you quit this easy then you much as well quit later... then i tell myself. if you relapse then you didn't quit at all, and it wasn't easy since you failed. that does it.

what other ways have you guys found to deal with your rationalization attempts. im thinkin of grabbing the shittiest, coarsest brand and having a few hits in a row so i get dizzy and end up puking so my mind associates smoking with feeling bad...

what do you guys think..

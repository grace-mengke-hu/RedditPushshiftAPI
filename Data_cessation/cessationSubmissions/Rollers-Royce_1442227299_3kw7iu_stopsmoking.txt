I quit Saturday night, and have been 36 hours without one. Don't know how though??

I've gone from smoking every time I have the chance, to none and no cravings. I've been a light chain smoker for around 2 years but have been smoking for about 4. Can anyone explain how I just randomly lost interest in it?

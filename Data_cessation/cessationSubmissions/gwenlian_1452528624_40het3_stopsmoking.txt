Cold Turkey not working for me

I've been trying to go cold turkey for the past week and something always comes up that I start smoking again.  I made a plan with my therapist to at least cut down to 2 cigarettes every two hours but I've already screwed that up.  I'm really anxious and that's what I turn to cigarettes for.  I'm going to try harder this afternoon and keep busy with knitting and baking cookies to get through the worst of it.

I'm new. Can I get some help here?

Like the title says. I'm new to the sub. I am 27 and have tried and failed many times to quit. As of right now I have 7 packs at home and 2/3s of one in my pocket as I type this out. I don't know what to do. 

I am a college student that does a way to just give or have people pay me for the remaining cigs so getting rid of them is not the problem.

What I do notice is that if I don't have a smoke on my drive to school or work I will not be very productive until I can go and get a smoke in.  For me I am a lighter smoker than I was 7 years ago. Sucking down 1.5 packs a day and frequent chain smoking sessions when I would get bored and go outside and enjoy the weather while I pondered things with a cancer stick in my hands, maybe even a book to go with it. Now I am down to 1/3 to 1/2 a pack a day I feel better than when I was doing my 1.5 pack a day.

Now to ask for your help. Message me keep up with me. Make me follow what I have set out to do. I will make an attempt at first limiting myself further. Monday will be my first day smoke free. I will try for sooner. Unless you guys have suggestions for me on quitting. Hound me. I will consider each and every one of you as a "sponsor". Like I said hound me. The more pressure I get from my friends, family, and complete strangers the better off I will be. My friends and family I can ignore. They aren't there every day for me. I don't have the option to just call them up and be able to talk about the stress and life in general. I will probably be posting in /r/offmychest as well to help. 

Thanks for reading.

My lungs hurt

Jesus expletive Christ I need to cut this junk out. I want some rehab place where I can sign in and be physically barred (restrained if necessary) from smoking... For, idk, 3 months. Or something. Fuck I need help with this. Fucking nervous. And  cutting the habit *just feels* like I'm gonna become an irate asshole at work.. That worries me. And fuck it: pot too while we're at it. The jazz cabbage habit can be an insidious little ambition-sucking shit disturber as well :/

Early thirties, smoking for a decade, getting desperate, need change NOW.

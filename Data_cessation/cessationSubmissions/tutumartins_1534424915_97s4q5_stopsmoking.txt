Bad Idea?

I’m on day 18, cold turkey, not even a puff from day one.

But I’m facing a serious problem: sept 23th I’ll take a really important written job exam. Since day one studying it’s almost impossible as my brain frog didn’t cleared until now....

So I’m thinking to use some NRT gum or patch  to see if my ability to sit and study comes back. I don’t now, kinda of desperate as that exam is really important for me now.

Any thoughts?

Vacation's got me back at it.

I came back from vacation with this addiction, so I must make this official again. I have to quit today! I'm tired of wasting money on it. It's nasty. It's been 660 days since I quit several years ago, and I'm not going to wait 6 more days to stop. It's time to stop, today!

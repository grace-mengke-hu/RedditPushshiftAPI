craving like fuck

I must NOT cave in to this nicotine trap... I'm really going thru some cravings and it sucks ass... but I know once I smoke a cig I'll feel guilty as fuck, I need to fix my badge but I quit on the 8th, three days ago, and this sucks. And this is after many attempts to quit, I think I got it this time.. cold turkey, no nicotine at all, I want to completely rid my body of this chemical

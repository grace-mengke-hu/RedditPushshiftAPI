Yesterday marked my 1 year smoke free. Just letting all you fellow quitters who are still struggling in the early stages know that it just keeps getting easier and easier, trust me. KEEP IT UP!

of all the things you notice after you quit smoking for a while (things taste better, cologne actually sticking to you, whiter teeth, better breath, less stinky car/clothes/home, etc...) one of the best is the seemingly infinite amounts of pocket space you have after not having to carry around packs of butts and lighters/matches anymore.

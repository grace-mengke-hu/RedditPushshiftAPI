Day 1 again.

I quit cold turkey 4 days ago after 7 years of smoking and I'm only 21. Today I caved in and had five. I've never felt worse about something. I let myself down and hard.  Though I can't stop thinking of a quote from the Dark Knight trilogy. "Why do we fall, master Bruce? So we can learn to pick ourselves back up."

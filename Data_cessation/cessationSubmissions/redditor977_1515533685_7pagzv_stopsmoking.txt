Starting again stronger

I'd quit smoking on a period from Sep to mid-Dec but somehow due to some weak point in my life and being bored of uni caused me to relapse. I lied to myself: I found myself rationalizing with the idea of quitting smoking being another obsession and that I should "take the quitting process easy" and whatnot. Little did I know it was merely a game of my mind. I smoked for two weeks, I drank and then I stopped exercising. It was not a good period. Everyday was filled with guilt and shame but I knew I would start again, stronger. Here I am, it's been almost 4 days again. This is once and for all, hopefully. 
This sub is one of the most, if not the most helpful in my journey of quitting. I wish all of us a smoke-free, healthy, resilient and fulfilling life.

What 150 feels like to me.

I started this whole thing off as a pack a day smoker, and I smoked for a little over nine years. I tried every quitting method, you name it, I tried it. Vaping was the only thing that worked for me, and that was only because a month into it, I convinced myself that, that was bad for me too. 

I'm having an extreme urge to have one right now, and I have no idea why! So I felt like, if I just type this joint out, I'll be good when its done. Anyways, it's pretty fucking awesome I don't have to go outside and shiver my nuts off in this freezing weather just to give myself cancer. Living life like that isn't even worth it. 

At 150, I feel like I have complete fucking control of my life when I say no to a cancer stick. Sometimes I even feel guilty for having to jump on here, just to give myself a pat on the back. But hey, if that's what keeps me from smoking, so be it. Everyone in my family has died from smoking, and I will not go out being a smoker. Fuck all that noise. I'm off to the gym, and I'll be back at 365.

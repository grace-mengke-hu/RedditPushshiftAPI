Hoping to stop before it begins

I'm a 20 year old guy and last new years I bought my first ever pack when drunk. I usually only smoke socially and even then very rarely but not wanting to waste and not wanting to tell anyone I started smoking them by myself at home. To be honest I quite enjoyed it as I found it chilled me out a lot and had a similar mental effect to being drunk or something. I just finished them and have a craving to buy more tomorrow as it can't be worse than buying McDonalds or drinking all the time can it? and I feel like i'm at the age when I should be trying new things an could quit before I leave uni. Please talk me out of it or give more advice.

Day 6 Cold Turkey.

Cravings are the worst right now. I've had to refrain from drinking  (I normally drink every weekend) because the cravings get too intense. So now I'm inadvertently quitting two things at once. I feel like I'm losing my shit. Need a little encouragement right now. 

Watching others drink is getting me super agitated, and I feel like I'm about to snap. Help? Anyone been through this? Please let me know what got you through it.

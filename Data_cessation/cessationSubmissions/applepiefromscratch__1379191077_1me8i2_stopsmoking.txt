Day 3 can kiss my ass.

Seriously. All day I've been feeling the urge to punch people in the face, throw things out a window, and smoke *anything*. Like, wet cigarette butts on the street are looking appealing. BUT, there has not been a moment yet when I actually might have smoked. The past couple days have been hard, but incredibly rewarding, and I'm not about to throw that away just as things are going to start getting easier. 

I'm posting this because I browsed this sub for months before quitting, and I used to feel discouraged when I would see people struggling. It made me feel like once I quit, my whole life would be a struggle. That was my smoker's brain lying to me. The truth is, it is the hardest, easiest, worst and best thing I've ever done. I'm not giving up, I'm pushing forward, and I am letting the cravings roll over me as they come. I feel good. And a little insane. And so very proud of myself.

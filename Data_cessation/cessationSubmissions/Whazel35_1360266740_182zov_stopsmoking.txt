Badge Removed after One Year

Is this really possible?  I cannot believe I've done this to myself.  But it's true.  I am smoking again.  I never thought I could fall into the trap.  I've been so certain since September 18th, 2011 that I would never smoke again and here it is. 

My fiance and I broke down a little over a week ago after an incredible fight that lasted a few days.  We have had tough times before - together for almost 7 years - but we never turned to nicotine.  This time we did and we were "fine".  No cravings - I couldn't even get past two puffs, but the buzz was nice.  
Now we're smoking about 5 to 7 each a day.  Rules were made, promises were made and now I'm sitting here dumb-founded.

Last year I stopped smoking using the book.  The Easy Way to Stop Smoking by Allen Carr.  He quit 7 months prior to me using the same method.  We love that book....

We've recently bought a house and just two nights ago we pulled the book out.  This weekend we will once again stop smoking.  

Please - do not fall prey to the idea that you can just have ONE.  Only one or two won't hurt.  Bullshit.  Be kind to yourself.  

DON'T DO IT.

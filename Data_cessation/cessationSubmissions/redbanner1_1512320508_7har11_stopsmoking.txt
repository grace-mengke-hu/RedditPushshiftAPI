40 days no smoking + down 60 pounds

My only issue lately is that I sometimes subconsciously move as though I am still a smoker. I don't want to smoke, nor do I think about it. Sometimes on my way to the kitchen I go out onto the deck, forgetting that I don't have a reason to go out there anymore. Sometimes when I'm driving, I reach up to the speedometer (where I used to keep my pack). It's weird.

Quitting the coffin nails was a decision I made 2 weeks after changing my diet. It seemed like a no-brainer given how well things were going. I just checked my weight for the first time and I'm down 60 lbs (well 59, but you can't blame me for rounding up that 1 pound). I maIntain that the diet made the quitting easier (and I honestly think the smoking made starting the diet easier). Getting the food-related toxins out of body I suspect helped carry the smoking-related toxins as well. This has been by far the easiest quit for me.

If anyone is interested, check out r/keto. That's the way I went, and it has been amazing for me. I also think there are a few other good choices like paleo or vegetarian/vegan. Something where you stop eating processed shit and start eating natural, because if you think the tobacco industry is the only ones making record profits off of your addictions while lying and manipulating, you haven't seen shit. 

Find something else to be addicted to, and make it healthy.

And thus concludes my preachy sermon.

Stay strong, friends. It's your life.

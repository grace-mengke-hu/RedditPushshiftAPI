Day 3: having avoided my smoker friends so far, I feel good.

I was a smoker for about eight years and have more failed quitting attempts under my belt than I'd like to admit.

I knew when I quit three days ago that something had to be different this time. I'm going full-on cold turkey: no vape, no patch, no cheating, no "bum just one from a friend while drinking and it doesn't count." Zero tolerance, no nicotine ever again.

So far, I'm feeling great! I've found that I feel fine/normal most of the time--there are just short outbursts of pretty miserable cravings. I try to keep myself busy, pop a stick of gum in my mouth with each craving, and refuse to let myself lament or wallow about it.

The one trigger I'm most worried about, which I've avoided so far, is hanging out drinking with friends. I think I'll turn down any invitations for the next few weeks, in the hopes that I'll feel stronger by then. Any tips for not smoking around your smoker friends?

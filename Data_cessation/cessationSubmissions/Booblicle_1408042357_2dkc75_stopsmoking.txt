Aromagasms - [NSFS] (Not Safe For Smelling)

I don't know if this is some kind of hyper effect from past smoking or is something that was always there and just never noticed when I smoked. It's also something that doesn't happen very often. But when it does its like getting hit in the head. 

Coffee. When I smoked, I drank gallons of the stuff, and particularly didn't care for it But it wasn't bad either.When I quit 10 months ago, I found i cared for it even less and practically grosses me out even with cream and sugar. I now maybe drink a cup or 2 a week, usually when there's nothing else , and want something other than water. I also make sure it's only early morning hours.

But there has been occasions when I smelled it, it practically effects me like cat nip to a cat. One time, when I coughed, coffee shot into my nose and sent me on a temporary aroma heaven. Another time was just going down the isle of a grocery store. Today it happened after doing my run. Someone had made a pot of coffee while I was out. Even stranger is that if i put my nose up to the coffee... it really doesnt smell all that great and that aromagasm doesnt seem present.

Anyone have insights into this? Is it a normal effect from coffee?

Going to give this a shot

Here's hoping I just smoked my last cigarette.

I'm all out, and it's too cold and rainy to go get more. I'm curled up in bed and am going to get a great night's sleep. When I wake up, it'll be seven hours or so. I just need to get to work without stopping for another pack.

I've been smoking for 19 years; started just shy of my 22nd birthday. I quit for about 9 months in 2002, but it obviously didn't last. 

What I'll think about, though, is how good I felt during those 9 months, versus how crappy I feel now. Sure, I'll never be 28 again, but I'm tired of being 40 and feeling tired, winded, and out of breath ... not to mention smelling like shit and spending far too much money (can't just get a pack of smokes - I need a drink, and mints, and a snack, all at convenience store prices). Plus, that whole "I'll probably get heart disease or COPD from this" thing.

Tired of it ... but I know I'm weak.

Wish me a strong will, because luck's not gonna cut it.

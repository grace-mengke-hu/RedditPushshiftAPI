30 days

Vaping 0mg pretty much daily and have been smoking weed some days in between not out of desire just plain boredom. I feel much better without them both and to be completely free of needing anything in my lungs but 'fresh' air. Just feels good to know I can do it. Also smells a lot better.

Also I have some pocket money and can allow myself to have a few things I consider a real treat:
- Vinyl records
- Concert tickets
- More Pis / Arduinos and periphery
- Drinks / rounds of drinks
- A nice meal
- Presents

To clarify, 30 days is since my last and so far only slip-up. I smoked a cigarillo for my dad's birthday. It wasn't great.

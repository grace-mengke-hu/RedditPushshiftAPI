Just checking in

Dear Stop Smoking Friends,

I just wanted to check in with you to let you know about my progress. It's been 53 days and I'm feeling great. Life gets so much better! I have about 1-2 cravings per week and they are not a big deal. The thought process goes like this: "Boy do I want a cigarette right now. Oh look, I'm having a craving. Smoking sucks and I'm not going to give in to my craving." The End. I just want to emphasize that it sucks at first but it gets easier every day. Just don't take that first puff and you will be on your way to better health, a whiter smile, and a brighter future. Cheers!

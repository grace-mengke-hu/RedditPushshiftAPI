Trying again

After smoking for 8ish years (I'm 21) I've been seriously trying to quit.  Got a vape last week and did ok but work is getting really busy and stressful so I bout packs fri/sat/sun/mon.  I haven't had any today and plan to keep it up.  How can I avoid the temptation to take a smoke break while working in a hot, sweaty kitchen 50 hours a week?

thanks guys

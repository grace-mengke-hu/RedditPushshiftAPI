Had an urge to smoke this morning...

â€¦until I walked out onto my apartment building's shared back porch (which I only enter when I need to access the stairs to the garbage can out back). Saw the upstairs neighbor couple huddled on their stoop, chain smoking as they always do. I used to smoke up there on rare occasions, but even as a smoker I was put off by the fact that they let their ashtray accumulate hundreds of butts and perpetually overflow. Inevitably rain and gravity would combine to create a gross and pungent tar coating across much of the porch. Now I'm off for a run! 20 days, no cigs. : )

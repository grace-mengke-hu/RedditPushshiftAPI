1st Day Towards Better Health

So officially I have been nicotine free for 4 days  but I figured since I have a twisted sense of humor I might as well make my quit day April Fool's so if I fuck up I can just say it was an April Fool's prank lol.

But in all seriousness I'm ready to end 6 years of this addiction and dependency and get back to my old love of running. This black lung has prevented me from working out and feeling confident in myself and I want to set a healthy future for myself while I'm still young. I look forward to the support from this sub and my new journey

Pink lungs here I come. Here goes nothing.

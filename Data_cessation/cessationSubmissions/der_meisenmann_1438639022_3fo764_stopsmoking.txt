I'm happy

Today I asked my SO:

"Do you know what day it is today?" 

She answered "It's August 3rd." 

I said "That is true and do you know what that means?"

She looked at me but couldn't guess what I'm getting at. 

"I smoked my last cigarette two months ago." 

She replied "Oh that's right." She smiled "I am proud of you."

Both that sentence and the fact that it feels normal to her and me that I don't smoke make me happy.

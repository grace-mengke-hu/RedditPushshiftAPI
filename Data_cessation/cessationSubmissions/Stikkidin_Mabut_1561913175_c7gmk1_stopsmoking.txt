I need to stop, and I need to stop now..

I recently became single, and I had to make some major changes in life - now for this next step; Stop smoking. And I want to stop. Right. Now.

I have tried the past two weeks, but when life hits, it was my go-to routine to light up a cigarette and reflect and cool off. Everytime I manage to hold off from the cigarettes for 3 hours, the urge to take one is so goddamn big. I’m reading Alan Carr’s book, since everyone recommends it.

But.. How do I do this?! This is pretty damn hard! I want to get a healthier lifestyle, I want the bad habit out of my life, I want to be able to think and relax without a ******* smoke. I don’t even like it. I hate the smell. I hate how my breath is like. I hate the taste in the morning, even though I thoroughly brush my teeths. I hate spending money on it. I hate that it’s just a quick fix. I hate that I’m not smelling of the perfume I put on. I simply just hate everything about smoking.

Let me just get a DAY without it. And then two. And then three.......

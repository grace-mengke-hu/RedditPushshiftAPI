10 days in and some thoughts

I'm now 10 days in to what's probably my 6th or 7th serious attempt at not smoking, but this time I think it's for good. The first few days sucked, the first weekend wasn't a whole lotta fun but here I am on day 10 not even thinking about smoking anymore.

I realised earlier today that this is the first time I've stopped because *I* wanted to stop, and that's probably the difference.

I didn't plan to stop when I did - I had a smoke as usual before I went to bed, got up in the morning and just thought "Nah, today's the day I'm going to kick it."

To anyone wondering if they can do it cold turkey - yes, yes you can, and if you want to stop, you'll totally do it :-) I've got a long way to go yet but I feel like I'm doing it for real now.

(apologies for the rambling)

Long time lurker and I think I may be ready...

Hey guys I have been a smoker since the age of 14. 7 years it has been now and I smoke anywhere from a pack to a pack and a half a day. I really want to quit and I dont know where to start. I love to smoke when I drive, after meals, after drinking, and most everything else... So any ideas how to start this? Every time I try to cold turkey I just end up just starting up again.

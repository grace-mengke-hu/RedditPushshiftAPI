Oh my god, I hate cigarettes. <rant>

I cannot fucking stand the smell of cigarettes. I didn't always feel this way. I use to think they were spicy and aromatic. Now I think they smell like BO mixed with burning dog shit. A lot of smoke just wafted into my bedroom. There were 4 fucking fucks standing on the sidewalk, smoking like fucking trains. What the fuck are they doing out there at 3 in the fucking morning, maybe something I can call the cops about? And maybe a really aggressive, unprofessional cop can respond to the call and detain them to death? I can dream. We need to move to a place where the bedroom window doesn't face the street. I can kinda handle it if it's outside, but if I can smell it inside my bedroom...and my sense of smell is *really* good now...I start to have irrational thoughts.

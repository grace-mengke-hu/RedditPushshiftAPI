One (Short) Month

It's been 28 days. I've been lurking, and can't thank you all enough for sharing your thoughts, trials, failures and successes on this sub. It's been a endless resource for me in trying to kick this shit. 

Tonight, I decided it's about time to sit down, join you all, and write a bit about how these weeks have been for me:

I smoked a pack a day for 6 years. I'm a very compulsive person. So, after a first few enjoyable cigarettes - BLAMO - half-a-pack a day within a week. And then a full pack in another week or so. Of course, the enjoyment of those first few was gone quick. I was savoring one, maybe two cigarettes out of a whole pack, and the rest were simply feeding a chemical addiction - answering the bell, like a boxer who never should have gotten in the ring in the first place. Now, I've been trying to channel that compulsiveness into more positive outlets.   

Enter, walking. There has been no shortage of anxious energy, and to deal with it all I've been going for walks. Long long walks. I realized quickly that smoking accounted for a good deal of my "outside" time during a day. And with quitting, I felt cooped up. So I began going for some fresh air (Funny, I had used this term countless times as a euphemism for going to smoke a cigarette). I live in New York. This place is so much richer as a non-smoker! Yes, many places smell like piss, and car exhaust, and cigarette smoke; but for each dude doused in AXE on the subway, there's a woman who anoints the air with her fair scent. Then there's the smells of 10 world restaurants intersecting across a single street, and Prospect Park after the rain with hot dog vendor water wafting. Oh ol' factory, so nice to have you back in production. 

My advice to everyone:
Tea tree oil toothpicks!

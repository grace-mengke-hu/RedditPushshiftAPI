265 days; 100 days until a year!

Just stopping in to share my excitement with how far I've come.  
  
I smoked about a half a pack a day for about 10 years (more on the weekends when I was drinking). I was a secret smoker, meaning I completely hid the fact that I smoked from certain people (family). I knew that I wanted to quit, and lurked this sub for almost two years before I actually started to quit. It wasn't until I shared with my brother that I was a smoker, and hearing the disappointment in his voice, that I got serious and decided to kick the habit.  
  
My last cigarette was the second night of a week-long family reunion. It was about 1am and I had two cigarettes left. I decided that this was the last cigarette I'd ever smoke, started a count-up timer app on my phone, lit one cigarette, then broke the other and threw it in the trash. I smoked that thing all the way to the filter, and when I was done, I was done.  
  
Looking back, I'm so happy with the decision I made, and I'm thankful everyday that I'm no longer a smoker; best decision I ever made. Looking forward to 100 days from now when I can celebrate one full year smoke free!

Does the brain fog ever truly go away, or do you just get used to living in that state?

Long story short, I don't really remember how I started nicotine. I either started vaping or I started smoking cigarettes at some point in college between long study sessions. At certain times, I was a chain smoker whereas other times I was a chain vaper. There was a heavy correlation between cigarette consumption and exams.

Fast forward several years, I smoke cigarettes occasionally when I'm around others who smoke, or when I'm really exhausted or brain dead towards the end of the day but still have things to do - if I had to estimate, I'd say a pack's worth every 2 months on average. I still have my vape which I use just as frequently. I started using nicotine patches which I found to be superior to cigarettes/vapes in every way except that it gives you crazy dreams when you forget to take it off to sleep. 

I am currently on vacation and I'm experimenting with not using nicotine at all due to my girlfriend's insistence that I should quit nicotine entirely instead of just moving to patches. I personally disagree but I figured I should just try it out. It turned out to be much easier than I thought, I just needed to reduce my food consumption so I wouldn't feel like I needed something after a meal.

However, there is one *major* problem. **Brain fog.** I've never felt so dumb in my life. I used to use patches every weekday and just be sober or vape on the weekends. This past month on vacation I've been reducing it to the days when I don't sleep enough. So far in the past 2 weeks I've only used it 3 times, and I'm starting to feel the dumbness taking over.

- I'm usually a very focused and attentive driver, but recently I've been in more "oh shit" moments than I can remember this whole year. Drifting into the other lane, missing a turn, etc.

- I can't seem to recall anything short term. I've always been that guy who loses his phone/keys/wallet in the house, but it has gotten exponentially worse. I'm finding myself leaving my phone in places I don't even remember going to.

- I lose focus in a conversation like an ADHD child. Now I've never been to a psychologist so I don't really know if I have attention deficiency issues to begin with, but it's definitely feeling like it. On several occasions, I have been talking to my mom and I suddenly realize my mind has gone on a tangent and completely ignored everything she said in the past minute.

On top of all this, my productivity has been severely reduced but I already expected this. I just didn't think it would come with so many side effects. I was never a very hard working student in high school, nor did I drive before college, so I'm not really sure if I'm just reverting back to my previous nicotine-free state or if this is a temporary withdrawal.

Can anyone chime in with their experiences, and maybe some advice on how to deal with (hopefully temporarily) becoming an idiot?

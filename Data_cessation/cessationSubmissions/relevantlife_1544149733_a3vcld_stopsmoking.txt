I'm approaching 3 weeks smoke free, but today was BY FAR the hardest day. I feel exhausted. But, I didn't smoke. If I can make it through a day like today with a cigg, I am confident I will never smoke again.

I wanted a cigarette all day. Morning, afternoon, evening. 

But I didn't fucking smoke, and I will remember tomorrow how shitty today was, and remind myself that if I could make it through today without smoking, I can make it forever without smoking.

Fuck cigarettes. I never want to go through this again.

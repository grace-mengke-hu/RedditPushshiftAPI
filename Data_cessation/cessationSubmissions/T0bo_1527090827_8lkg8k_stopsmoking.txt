Please help me quit smoking

I need help! I don't know how to start. First thing in the morning i'm going for coffee and 3-4 cigarettes. EVERY.GODDAMN.MORNING. I'm smoking for 14 years now and it's killing me that i can't quit. I'm pretty sure the mental setup is everything so please, help me quit. :(

Guys.. please!

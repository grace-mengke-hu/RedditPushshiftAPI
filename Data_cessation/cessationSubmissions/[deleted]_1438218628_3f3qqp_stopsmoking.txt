23 hours - glad i got rid of all tobacco in the house

12 year smoker. read "allen carr's easy way", finally got round to the final chapter last night. it's been mostly smooth going - cravings happen but they disappear in 10 minutes or so. i am glad i disposed of my tobacco. somehow remembered an emergency pack with two cigarettes in from 3 or 4 years ago a couple of hours ago and destroyed them too.

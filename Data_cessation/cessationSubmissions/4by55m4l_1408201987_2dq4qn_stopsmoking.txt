I Think I Finally Broke Through! (With The Help of EasyWay)

So I've been struggling with quitting for the last few months. I seriously tried but then slipped up after running into an ex gf and having a really terrible day at work. I just caved and afterwards I just felt so weak and miserable. Those feelings led me through 2 more packs until one day I woke up with a sore chest, a wheezy cough and seriously craving. I said enough is enough and instead of going downstairs to buy a pack I decided to look at some of Allen Carr's videos. I go through a bunch and after I've watched about 2 hours of videos I feel like I've really changed my perspective on the matter. When I look at smokers I no longer feel envious or like I'm missing something and when I get a craving I know how much of a better place I am in now and how much happier I am even now, with a craving, than I will be after I have a cigarette and then still have the craving later. I just want to say thanks to reddit for getting me on the right path once and for all and for giving me the motivation and resources to succeed. 

Love you guys <3

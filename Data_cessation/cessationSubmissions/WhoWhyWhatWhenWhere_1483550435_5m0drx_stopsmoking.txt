To all of the New Year's Quitters---

Keep it up!  You can do it!  You have to want to and you have to put effort.  After 28 days you will no longer be addicted.  After 3 months the constant cravings will stop.  After 6 months you'll be home free!  You just have to learn to say no, believe in yourself, and understand that you will most definitely thank yourself later!  Good luck!

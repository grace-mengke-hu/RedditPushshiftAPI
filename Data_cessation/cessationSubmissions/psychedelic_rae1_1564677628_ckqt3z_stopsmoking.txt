I quit again...

So I was a 10 year smoker. Started when I was 17 and gave into a bit of peer-pressure. Mom tried to get me to stop before I got addicted but you know that teenage rebellion and big-headedness tells you that "it can't possibly happen to me, I can quit whenever I want" and now 10 years later... Lmao. Anyway, so I quit last time around Xmas for the first time and made it to 2 months. I did it for my ex at the time and for his health. Well, around the 2 month mark, shit hit the fan and I got super stressed and pissed off and started smoking again. Not an excuse but breaking up with him was fucking nuts and I needed something to cope. (He was abusive, toxic and I was, in turn, abusing him, too. I know, terrible thing to do! But it totally hit home that I needed to leave him cus he was all into continuing the relationship. It was fucked up. It needed to be done. So it was a total fucking mess. Was with him almost 4 years and we lived together. So way too much to deal with.) Well anyway, I ended up meeting this amazing guy and total opposite of all the relationships I had - he wanted me to be healthier and he wanted us both to quit. So he bought us both vapes and it's now been a week since I smoked a cigarette. So yay! Hopefully this time it sticks. I really hate smoking cigarettes. At least this time was a bit easier - i have a lot less stress going on!

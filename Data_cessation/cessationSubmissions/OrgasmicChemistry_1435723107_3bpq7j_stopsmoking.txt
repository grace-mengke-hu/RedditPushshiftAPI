Question to students who have quit

I have really bad test anxiety; I took a gap year; started smoking and now it seems like cigarettes are the only thing that keep my nerves down for a test. I quit today because I had a test this morning (quit after test). I have another test on Monday; any advice? Am I going to be able to fxn?

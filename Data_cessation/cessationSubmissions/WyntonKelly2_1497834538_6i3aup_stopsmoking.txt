I am on the other side..

I met a cute girl yesterday. While chatting she suddenly lit up a cigarette. 'mmm, too bad she smokes..' i tought. Followed by internal giggles. Holy shit, this is the first time i have this tought after having smoked for 18 years..

I am starting to feel like a non smoker, instead of a smoker who is not allowed to smoke anymore. After having struggled heavily for the first 5 weeks, this is a relieve. I am sure there will be more bumps to come, but progress is undeniable.

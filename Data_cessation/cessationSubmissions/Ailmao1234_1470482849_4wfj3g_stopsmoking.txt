Over one month! Highly irritable.

I've quit for over one month now and haven't so much as touched a cigarette. I work abroad in a completely different country with a completely different culture to my own, but the thing that has distracted me most from cigarettes are my job and the fact that I've had my games and energy drink to come back to when I get home. I've pretty much neglected everything (my room, relationships, etc.) besides work and when something happens that kicks me out of my schedule (gaming and not being in the now) I get really, really irritated.

Annoyed like you wouldn't believe. I've read that the irritability is supposed to fade after like 72 hours and I've read in other sources that it takes like 3 months for your brain chemistry to return to normal. It usually doesn't bother when I can just get up, shower, go to work, game, eat and drink energy drink but if anything breaks that routing (i.e. not being able to game in the weekend because my laptop is having issues) I get annoyed and irritated at every possible little thing.

I'm typing this post right now because I'm in exactly that situation right now and really, really annoyed at everything.
And I guess I would like some support or advice. :P

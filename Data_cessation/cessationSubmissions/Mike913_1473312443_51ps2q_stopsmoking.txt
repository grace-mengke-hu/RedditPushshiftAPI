Harder than I thought...

Hey everyone, quit smoking cigs about 3-4 weeks ago. Wasn't a heavy smoker, 4-5 packs in total and hookah maybe 2 dozen times. Bought an ecig to satisfy some nicotine cravings, trying to ditch that now. Smoked hookah yesterday and totally regret it. 

Had a slight cough over the past few days but the doctor said I did have a virus so I mean maybe it's related. Please send some encouraging support messages I really need it.

edit: i just wanted to add that i quit because i'm terrified of the health consequences

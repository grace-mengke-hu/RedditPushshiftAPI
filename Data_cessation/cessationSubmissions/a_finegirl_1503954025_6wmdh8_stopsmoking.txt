How to get to sleep!

So I've accidentally quit? I had intended on quitting by the end of the year, but had made no actions to actually do so. I smoked half a pack a day for the last six years, but would go 24-48 hours without a cigarette every once in a while (like when on vacation in NYC and refusing to pay $15 for a pack of smokes or $20 for a pack in Canada). Over the last month, I started cutting down to five cigarettes a day, mostly at work, but one just before bed.

Then I got a cold. For the last four days, I am so congested in my chest every inhale hurts. I tried to smoke a cigarette, and between the inhale and my throat on fire, I thought I was gonna die. So I figured, "this is a sign," and had hubby go buy me nicotine patches.

I'm getting mild headaches in the very back of my head, near the nape of my neck, intermittently through the days, but nothing too bad. Nothing I can't handle yet. No anxiety yet. No other real symptoms yet. But sleeping. Without my "just before bed cigarette," I'm laying in bed, staring at the ceiling like an eight year old the night before school.

Last night after an hour of my toes twitching and huffing and puffing in irritation, I almost crawled out to bed to go buy a pack in my pajamas but talked myself out of it. After another hour I fell asleep but it was fitful.


Any advice?

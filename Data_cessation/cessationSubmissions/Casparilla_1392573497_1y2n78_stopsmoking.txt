Day two and I feel like I'm going out of my mind.

I am so fixated on the idea of satisfying the craving to give myself relief. In the end, I know it will only prolong my pain. Anxiety and stress if I smoke. Anxiety and stress if I don't. I feel like I could crack at any moment and I'm considering going to get a nicotine eCig today. Have they worked for others? The lack of medical studies on them has me concerned about their safety. 

PS - I'm 42 and I've been smoking since I was a teenager. Through the years I've tried Chantix, Wellbutrin, the patch, gum, and lozenges. I've had some successes of up to 6 months smoke-free, but somehow I always fall back down that smoking rabbit hole. Help!

White-Knuckling It Tonight

i'm closing in on 2 weeks nicotine-free, cold-turkey. i smoked for 39 years (minus a few, if i can count previous longish-term quits). 

nominally, i did it for a job. i mean, it was my goal to quit by the end of January anyway, but i was offered the job i'd been pursuing only to learn that using nicotine would render me ineligible for consideration.  ANY kind of nicotine. NO nrt products. No e-cigs, presumably not even 0 mg juices.

please, all i need right now is to be talked down from the raging trigger i've been fighting for the past 2 hours. all i did was drive home from (almost former) job. i made it past the convenience store, the beer distributor and the gas station. i'm "in for the night". 

this is the worst it's been in 2 weeks.

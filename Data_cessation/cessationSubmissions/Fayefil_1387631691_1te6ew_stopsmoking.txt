After not smoking for over 100 days, I have spent the last week smoking. Feels awful!

My throat hurts, chest hurts, feeling craving symptoms again. I hate smoking! I am turning 30 in about two weeks and I'll be damned if I'm spending the last two weeks of my 20s a smoker. Resetting my quit app today!

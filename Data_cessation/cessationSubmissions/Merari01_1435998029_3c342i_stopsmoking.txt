22 years a smoker, today is first day without.

I'm constantly feeling like I am missing something. Then I realise what that is and I think "oh crap".  Does anyone have insight into when the constant cravings will dissipate?

I never realised how much I arranged my life around smoking before. With every little thing I do, cleaning, eating, going outside, everything, I always used to either accompany it with or reward myself afterwards with a cigarette. I have taken to putting a toothpick in my mouth and sucking on that instead. 

I feel slightly nauseous, lightheaded, irritable, short-tempered and annoyed. Does anyone have insight into when I'll feel like myself again? 

Well, I just needed to vent this I suppose. Writing it down makes me feel slightly better. I could use some insight and encouragement though.

Is the general consensus here that a complete transition to e-cig is equal to having quit?

I was on it for two months, slowly weening myself off of it, until it stopped working. The one I got was nearly $100 and I'm hesitant to invest in a new one. I've since taken up light cigarette smoking and feel a little defeated.

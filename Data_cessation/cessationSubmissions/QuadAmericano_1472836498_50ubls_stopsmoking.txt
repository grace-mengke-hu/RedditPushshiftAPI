I did it.

I've been a smoker since I was 15 (16 years ago) and have gotten myself down to 1-2 smokes per day, but i used to smoke 10-15 per day.  In the past year, that has meant i stop by a gas station on my way to work to buy a few single cigarettes.  

It's been a daily routine and frankly an embarrassing one. The clerks see me coming and have a couple of singles already on the counter.  I would justify it by saying to myself "you're just buying two.  It's not like you're getting a pack."  The thing is, it left an open door for me.  I'd bum off of friends while drinking or split a pack with a buddy and end up binging.  I did this in front of my pregnant wife a few weeks ago and realized how fucked up it is and that I cannot let my future kid ever see me with a smoke in my mouth. 

So I haven't stopped by either of the gas stations which (illegally) sell singles since Tuesday.  This feels great, and i'm drawing a lot of inspiration from this subreddit. 

Stay strong, y'all.

8 weeks! Feels good!

I am getting close to 8 weeks of not smoking, I had a brief lapse after the first couple of days when I crashed my car.

Since then though, I have been going strong, to the point that if I smell cigarette smoke, I come close to vomiting.

No patches, no gum, no lozenges, I can even have a beer at a pub without craving a smoke.

This along with my working out 4 to 5 days a week, has ensured I am not putting on quitter weight!

So happy!

Keep it up fellow non-smokers! It is hard, but a worthwhile step to healthy living!

Less Cravings, More Snacking!

So I'm coming up on two weeks smoke free and during the day has been great, I've kept busy chasing my almost toddler and honestly dont think about it. 

At night though, I start getting the cravings with the house is quiet and my smoker husband is still up. Yesterday I thought I would crack, I stood outside with him while he smoked one, he finished it... and then he lit a second one and... I thought to myself "that smells fucking awful"! 

I'm proud of myself woot! The only thing that has sucked is the over-eating. I can't stop snacking! My next goal will be to start controlling my diet. Any tips to cut down snacking until then??

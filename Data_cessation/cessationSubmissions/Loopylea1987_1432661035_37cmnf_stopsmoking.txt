5 days

I have been stopped smoking for 5 days after smoking 15 a day for 12 years. YAYYY!! I am taking Champix which make them smell (and taste) foul. Stopping in this way has still taken a lot of willpower  (which I didn't think I possessed). I still find I think I want one but realise it is at certain times where I would have had one. I catch myself thinking about it and say to myself no, you are a non-smoker now and the edgy feeling eases. 

I am glad I found this thread â˜º

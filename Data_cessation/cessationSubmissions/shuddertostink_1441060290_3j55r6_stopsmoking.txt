Patches- skipped step 2 to 3... how long to get used to it ?

I decided that it was a good day to step down from step 1 to 2 because I'm home and could deal with being a little tired, little foggy headed etc.  But they didn't have step 2 so I bought step 3 and the day's been a lot harder than I expected. How long will it take before my body is used to the reduced level of nicotine and I'm "normal" at step 3 ?  I'm not looking forward to the work week right now.... wondering if maybe I should just skip step 3 altogether at this point, nyquil out, sleep for like 12 hours and be over all of it ? 

thanks.

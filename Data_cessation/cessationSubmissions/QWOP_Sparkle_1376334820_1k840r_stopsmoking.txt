A friend of mine who supported me quitting, has started smoking.

I would like to say I'm disappointed/concerned but I'm honestly not.

I'm more angry than anything. He was never a smoker until now, he called me stupid and everything under the sun for being a smoker, when he found out I was quitting he helped me wherever I could and whenever I felt tempted to follow the cravings he questioned 'why? is it really worth it?' and helped at really crucial moments.

I'd like to say I'm in the safe zone now. I don't think I could ever go back to smoking, I'm free from all the stress and worry that it brought me.

But to find out that the person who called you a moron for being a smoker...is NOW a smoker. I have no idea how to feel. I feel sort of betrayed in a sense. He doesn't seem to care. 

I dunno. I just needed to rant. I'm really pissed off right now about it as well as having other things going on in the background doesn't really help the scenario.


What exactly do you say to someone who has started? I remember feeling sort of invincible before the addiction actually took hold of me, 'I can quit anytime' I thought, but then I realised how much of a struggle it actually was and I can see it happening to him. He's really lax on it right now but soon he's going to regret it every step of the way. I don't think I've ever met a smoker who actually *likes* smoking in the long run.

Looking for motivation to get off these fucking things.

I've been smoking regularly for about 3 years straight now, and it's keeping me from doing so many things I want to do. I cough a lot, get tired when I'm drumming, can't sing for as long as I used to, and the skin on my fingers turn orange every now and then. I've tried many times, but cave after a few days. I've been smoking since I went to rehab, which ironically was the only thing I've ever been addicted to, and I just want to stop. Please help :(

Switched to Vaping. Been coughing up plegm for about a week now, but I quit over a month ago?

Smoked for about 6 years and quit like 2 1/2 months ago. Had a period that felt like improved lung function but lately have felt breath is shallow and caughing up clear plegm pretty often. Is it my Vaping?

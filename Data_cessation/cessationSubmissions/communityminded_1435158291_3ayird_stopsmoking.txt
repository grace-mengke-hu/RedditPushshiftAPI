It's no more smo for me

I've been smoking 12 years. I've read Allan Carr a few years back and quit for 6 months and have had months off here an there. I'm really keen to quit for good this time. I finished my pack at lunch and said goodbye to cigs. First day not smoking started half an hour ago (I'm in Australia). 
I like the idea of a quitting diary suggested by a user here. I'm keen to start getting healthy again!!

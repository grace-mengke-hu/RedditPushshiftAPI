Once again

I lasted 2 days last time. This time I need and want to quit so badly. I can't afford it. I'm wheezing and coughing. Always feeling out of breath. I have 4 left in this pack that I think I will try to space out tomorrow..and then say adios. Hell. Maybe I'll try to go without all day. I'll be in a rental car the next week, so I'm thinking this will help since my major smoking time is on my long commute to work. Send me good vibes please! And any tips... I'm going through a lot of rough personal things and typically stress makes me wanna smoke more. So I've gotta find something to do in its place.

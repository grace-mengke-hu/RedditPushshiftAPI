Holy Wow! Today was bad!!

Day 12. I feel bad for my kids. I was this crying, yelling, complaining puddle of a Mom today. The Hubby's quitting too. This household is in rough shape.

But...... for the first time in I don't know how long, I jumped on my crappy ass treadmill. I just had to get the fuck away from everyone for awhile. So I walked... Then I ran. And ran more. And more. I ran until the rage settled. Took me 37 minutes.

I feel like I can breath again....For now

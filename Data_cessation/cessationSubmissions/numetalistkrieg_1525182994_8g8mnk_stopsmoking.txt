Checking in, need the accountability.

Yo. This is my fifth day without cigarettes, and my second round of quitting.

Posting because I had a little nagging thought this morning: "I am alone, I'm pretty isolated, who's going to know or care if I smoke or not?" Well, now y'all know. I figure I can be honest with you good folks. I'm craving but I'm not caving. Not today.

One Month!

I am so happy to see my updated badge today. I really wanted a smoke this weekend and I kept thinking about having to reset my badge and my quitting tracker. I constantly had the "oh it's just one" argument in my head, but I succeeded in saying no again, for the 400th time!

You guys are all awesome, and I always stop by to see what you are saying. It really helps a lot :)

My personal stock take after 604 days.

I saw someone posting about it being a year since they had last had a cigarette, so out of curiosity, I thought I'd see how long it had been since I decided to quit. 604 days. It has taken 10 years and 4 or 5 attempts, but I feel like I've made it, like I finally have quit. Some things I've managed to achieve in the last 604 days.

- Saved over $8000 by putting extra money aside each week; SO and I are using it to go on holiday for my birthday next week.

- The holiday will be spent running, laughing, dancing and generally doing a lot of things that used to have me out of breath, and usually taking place in areas I would have had to leave once an hour or so to have a cigarette.

- My delicious perfumes actually get to make me smell amazing, instead of being a sickly sweet cover over the smell of cigarette.

- I've realised a few other areas of my personal health that I wanted to work on; quitting smoking helped me see that it wasn't the huge uphill battle I thought it would be. If I can quit cigarettes, I can quit binge eating too. If I can breathe easier, running will be easier. If I want to do it, I can do it!

Things that made that last ~20 months so much easier than any of my previous attempts:

- My fiance quit with me

- I WANTED to quit

- Less time sitting in front of the computer and more time using my hands/ working physically

- Chewing sugar free gum

- Avoiding coffee/alcohol/energy drinks


If you've read this thank you. The post is mostly a check/reminder to myself of what I have managed to achieve, and what I'm capable of. Thanks for the suppport SS, you've been great.

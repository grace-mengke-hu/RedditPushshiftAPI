I can't "start stopping"

Hi everyone,

And wondered if some of you had this feeling before stopping: I know I could undertake the cravings and go through the painful weeks, but I can't get myself that stop.

I'm always feeling like before sleeping is not the right timing nor is it after having breakfast. I finally end up never take the shot and keep on smoking.

Hence I thought it would be helpful asking experienced lads on Reddit!

Back at zero. I am a loser

So, what was my four day celebration turned into a resetting of the clock. I suck so hard. 

My husband smokes. He was out with the kids, I was finally able to relax and unwind and I find his stash. I smoked. I've been drinking wine and smoking and I suck.

The stuuuuuuuupid thing is, I was feeling great and I was VERY aware that it didn't do anything for me. All it did was make me feel like shit. I didn't feel more relaxed or happier. NO MORE. 


Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuck

I am done.

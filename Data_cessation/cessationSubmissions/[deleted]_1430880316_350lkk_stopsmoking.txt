Gums hurt?

Hi, I've been smoke free for a week and my gums are killing me! They are really inflamed and look a little infected. I've been brushing them really gently... Is this something that goes away? Has anyone else experienced this or does this have nothing to do with quitting? I find the latter hard to believe because it's happened within the past week.

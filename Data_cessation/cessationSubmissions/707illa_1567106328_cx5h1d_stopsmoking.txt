Today's the day

I been a smoker way to long. I haven't had a cig since yesterday. Ive tried many times before with patches, pouches, chewing tobacco, sunflower seeds, vaping, gum, weaning, pills from the doc., name it. Nothing worked. Now, I go cold turkey.  This is hard as fuck, but I want to be around as long as I can for my young daughters. Wish me luck y'all.

I quit smoking for New Years and I enjoy the anonymity of the Internet.

I quit smoking for New Years and it has stuck. I used to be somewhat of a "party animal" but now drinking has -zero- appeal to me. I love how GOOD I feel as a non smoker. I'm in love with feeling good now. And when I drink I really crave cigarettes. It's the ONLY time I crave them. I don't like the feeling of drinking without smoking and I know I don't want the feeling back of drinking with smoking... So I prefer not to drink anymore. Which is cool with me because I've got my weekend mornings back! Except people I'm with always want to drink. Also I don't like talking about this with people I know because I don't like drawing attention to that side of me. I'd rather let that side disappear.

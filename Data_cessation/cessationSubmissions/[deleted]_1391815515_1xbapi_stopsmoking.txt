Mini-rewards?

I've never smoked and it's difficult for me to understand exactly what this is like to go through. My boyfriend is on day 38 and he's doing pretty well but I'd like to have some sort of advent-calendar type thing that could encourage him in a non-patronising way. He semi-jokingly suggested the idea, not that he needs it as he's been doing fantastically (I'm amazed and so proud).

I'm wondering what would help in the way of supportive gestures. I've surprised him with various foodstuffs but I don't want to keep bringing him food. I also don't want to keep reminding him that he's a non-smoker now. I'm a bit at a loss. Does anyone have anything they could suggest?

Many thanks!

After hitting a low I had to do it today

The past weekend I stayed indoors, drinking beer and playing video games. I think I smoked 5 packs of cigarettes over the course of the weekend, the main reason being that I live in a country where cigarettes are so cheap that money is not an issue, and then I buy them tax free too because I fly a lot due to work; all in all, at any given time I'll have a few cartons of cigarettes laying around the house. This has led to me smoking more and more and more.

But as I woke up this morning and had a morning cigarette, feeling kinda shit, I decided to leave my smokes (and lighter) at home before going to work. And then I decided to keep it that way until I got home from work. And when I got home from work, 12 hours cigarette free, I tried lighting one up, only to immediately feel the effect it was having on me: slightly light headed, tintling feeling. I extinguished it after 1 drag thinking to myself how f*cked up it was that I was taking substances that were having such effects on me.

As of now, I'm sitting here having a beer, because although normally drinking makes me want to smoke more you have to grab the bull by the horns. Long story but I really needed to vent a bit and reading through here the last few weeks really helped strengthen me in my resolve to get rid of this stupid habit.

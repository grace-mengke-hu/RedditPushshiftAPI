Philosophy To Quit Smoking

So I'm on my quit smoking journey.  I smoked a cig just now and it brought me absolutely no pleasure.  I believe that's a step in the right direction.

I think all addictions stem from one thing: an unwillingness to feel pain.

So I'm starting to realize that all pleasure seeking puts me on a rollercoaster that leads to pain.  This post will cause me pain.  I'm not some guru who has no desires.  I'm just me.

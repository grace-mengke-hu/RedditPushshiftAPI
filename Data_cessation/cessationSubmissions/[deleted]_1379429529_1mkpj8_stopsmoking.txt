Just had my last work cigarette, today is the last day!

So I just went out for my last cigarette during work.  When this pouch of tobacco runs out later on today, it will be the last time I smoke.

Long term heavy smoker.

I have been going through a lot of self improvement and achieved so much of which I am immensely proud.  Smoking is the final artifact of my previous life of slovenly ways.

My self discipline is now my most potent weapon and I intend to put it to good use and kick this final addiction of mine once and for all.  I wanted to quit sooner, but first wanted to be sure I was over my weed addiction, didn't want to take on too much at once.

Today I feel ready, tomorrow I get my badge.

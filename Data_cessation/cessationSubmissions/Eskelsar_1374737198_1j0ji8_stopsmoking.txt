Taking the plunge again, ready more than ever!

I know my flair must be incorrect since I started up again a few months back. I'm on mobile so I'm not sure how to change it right now.

Anyway, today I made a change. I am 17 years old and have been smoking off and on since I was 13, each time smoking more and more. My last time quitting was quitting from smoking about 7-12 a day. This time, I went a little more overboard with not having my mom watching over me so much anymore. For the last three months I've been smoking nearly a pack a day, sometimes as many as ~30. This was clearly a huge problem for me and, after attempting to quit multiple times in the last few weeks, I finally said no to myself today and plan to never smoke another day in my life.

I'm expecting some difficulties, but I know I can do it.

Drinky = Smokey

Over three weeks quit. And very rarely missing it tbh. Maybe 10 seconds every day where I think smoking would be a good idea.
However, rather luckily, I've been on meds that mix badly with alcohol. As a result no drinking.
I'm getting rather worried about how I'll behave when I've had a few tipples. In my head red wine, steak, coffee, chocolate, and cigarettes are delicious in any combination.

Any tips on avoiding that drunken cigarette? Or anything that can substitute it (that isn't vaping)?

Hey! You're trying to quit smoking! Dig this shit...

I noticed when I was quitting that when I was craving a cig my stomach would tense up. Learn to relax your body with your mind. This is a big part of it. Relaxing. 

I used to get depressed when I was quitting. Why? I had no idea what the fuck was going on. I felt powerless. THIS IS OKAY, and you will find a new power. The reason you are feeling powerless isn't an illusion... you are actually giving up something that made you powerful (at least in your head) You will LEARN NEW POWERS because you are not a pussy.

 A big fear and deterrent to quitting is that you don't "feel like you" so in order to get "back to normal" you give up and smoke again. THIS IS MORE BS... It takes way more time than you want it to to feel like yourself again, BUT YOU WILL. 

Honestly the depression was the hardest thing for me. 

I am not the same person I was when I was a smoker. Embracing the new you is most of the battle, as far as I can tell.

PROUD OF YOU PEEPS!!!

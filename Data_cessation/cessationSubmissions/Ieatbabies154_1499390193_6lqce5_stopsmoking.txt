Can we get a new badge system that differentiates between cold turkey and NRT?

Half the reason we have this badge system is so we can give advice and relate to people knowing where they are at during their quit. Sometimes people with 60 days on their badge talk about their intense nicotine cravings as they quit NRT, and we give advice to them as if they had quit cold turkey.

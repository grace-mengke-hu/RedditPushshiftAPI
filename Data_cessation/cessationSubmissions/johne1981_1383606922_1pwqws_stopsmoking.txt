Patting myself on the back. 2 years!!!!

2 years today. Best thing I have ever done is quitting smokes. It gets so much easier. and craving are months apart now. I had my first craving in as long as I can remember on Saturday but passed in seconds. 

Well done to all the quitters this place was an inspiration.

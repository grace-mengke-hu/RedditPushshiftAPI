Anybody starting their attempt with Stoptober?

I'm scared and haven't ever tried quitting before. With Stoptober coming, I thought I'd give it a go, and if I succeed for a month then all the better to keep going! I've downloaded the NHS stop smoking app and the quit kit, and I'm thinking about buying some  patches to keep me going.

Anybody else from the UK giving it a go??

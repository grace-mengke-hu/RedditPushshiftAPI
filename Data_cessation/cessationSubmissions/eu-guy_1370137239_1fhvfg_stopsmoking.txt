When is it too late for a smoker's lungs to regenerate?

Everywhere on the internet you see people asking how long it takes for an ex-smoker's lungs to regenerate. What I hadn't realized before is that it can get too late, that there will be no healing process. I am 27 years old and smoked for 12 years. Always I thought that I could stop smoking and regenerate back to a healthy life. I haven't smoked for 80 days now. Still, I am kind of terrified that it might be too late. There are people saying they smoked for too long and now their lungs cannot regenerate because their bronchial tubes are utterly cluttered with tar and cannot get the dirt out of the body anymore. So their lung will remain black and weak...

I coudn't find anything on how long one must smoke for their bronchial tubes to get destroyed.

Does anyone know?

What's working for me. [Day 51]

It has been 51 days already so I thought I'd share my experience so far...     
disclaimer: I was never a pack a day smoker (only under extreme stress) and about 8-10 if clubbing and on usual days, 2-5 sticks...so maybe I shouldn't have a hard time quitting...? who knows.    
.     

My only thought process closer to day 0 was that if I can't quit anything at will, I'm probably addicted and need to do something about it.     

The Doing something part: we all know the effects on health yet we continue to...so that obviously wasn't a good motivator..needed something stronger so my friends and I joined muay Thai...being cardio heavy, it's a great way to find out how much of a shit shape you're in...     
slowly I started paying attention to my diet and then I realized that if I'm burning all those calories and don't want to reverse it by eating junk, why am I continuing to smoke?    
.     
This is turning out to be a big motivator..trying to be physically fit shows me how much I need to improve and not take the body for granted....     
So I started on Day 0. On day 7, I had 3 puffs of a ciggy but it tasted so bad that I out it away (also thinkin about my badge here).    
Do the cravings come? Yes , they do occasionally.    
DO they last long? NO...    
.       
if anyone's on the edge...i hope this really helps you think about it.

How do you deal with rage while quitting?

I have through my entire life had an anger problem. In the past it would manifest physically and I would end up breaking things or hurting myself. For the past 7 years I've taken a few minutes off my life span at a time and that seems to have quieted my rage. Today I'm quitting but I hate everyone I speak to, and want to up and walk out of my job. 

If my emotions are this high indefinitely I will have to start smoking again just to keep myself from loosing my job or everyone I care about. Does anyone else have as serious of an issue with anger when they quit?

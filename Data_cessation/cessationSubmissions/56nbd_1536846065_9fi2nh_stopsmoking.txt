TWO MONTHS!

I previously tried many times. Mostly vapes and other NRT. That just kicked the can down the road and prolonged the "oh shit, I don't have any nicotine on me" anxiety.

Finally quit cold turkey and on first attempt here I am. I have the occasional dreams that I smoke but that's about as hard as it gets these days.

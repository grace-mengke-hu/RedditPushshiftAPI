Details on my trial, been smoking for 28ish years.

My Badge reminds of how long this attempt is working.  I've cheated(alcohol was involved,) but I am still trying hard.  I got an e-cig and I feel it's most not helping. It's like wanting a Coke and only having store brand diet soda.  My fingernails are gone, the cravings are pretty bad.

One month yesterday! And I couldn't be more proud of myself.

So, yesterday I have been one month without a cigarette. I also quit drinking (temporarily because it makes me want to smoke) so yesterday I had my first beer on a month to celebrate. I just, I feel amazing. It's still hard, it's still a constant job, but I've never been more proud of anything I've done. 

It sucks, I've received a surprising lack of support from friends and family, who share the attitude that I never should have started in the first place, and that this is what's almost expected of me. Ive quit thanks to my friends at r/vaping , and my family is wondering when I'm gonna stop that too, but I have the mindset that I wanna take it slow to make sure I quit for good. A pack a day for 10 years , and I think if I start again I'll never quit again. So anyways that's it! Thank you guys for the inspiration!

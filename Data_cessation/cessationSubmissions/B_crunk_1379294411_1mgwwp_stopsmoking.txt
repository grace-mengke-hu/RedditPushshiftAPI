I'm done with it.

I've decided to quit smoking. I've been smoking for 7 years now. I have tried to quit a few times before, but always ended up failing. This time I really want to be done. I'm tired of always struggling to breathe. I've already got mild sleep apnea and don't need something else to make it even harder to breathe while I sleep. I'm sick of spending the money on cigarettes. I'm staying at a friend's house this coming week and won't have my own ride to go get smokes. I hope this will make for a good time to stop. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I will keep you posted.

Facing that.

Sometimes I just feel so alone but people care, and they try. The little ones will want me around as they grow. The feelings of not being good enough or the person you love not sharing the same feelings or the frustration with your job. The apathy is overwhelming and my light is fading it feels, so I light a smoke as my own little sacrifice. I don't want to be here forever but I don't want you to be here alone because the world is hard which is why I've been doing this in the first place. I don't show any weakness or cracks but know as I go outside that's what I use to hide all of it. Those puffs of poison. I need to quit and find that person I was before I started, he was more fun than this person I am now. Good luck you all, I don't know what the hell I'm saying anymore.

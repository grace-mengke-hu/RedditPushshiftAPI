PSA: If things go wrong in your life, smoking will not make them better.

So I had some issues happen recently regarding an ex. Problems at work had me lose sleep. Today marks 15 days I quit.

I was thinking for a second how I could smoke just a pack and nobody would know. Everything would just be slightly a little bit better.

Truth is, it wouldn't. I'd still have the same problems, it wouldn't taste good and I would be back to square one. Actually I'd be worse. So remind yourself, whatever you're going through, smoking is not going to help.

One thing that has helped me when I get a craving is not imagining the times where cigarettes felt good, like when chainsmoking over beers with friends in a club.

Remind yourself of how it felt like when you woke up the next day. When you were sick, remember how those cigarettes tasted like ? Remember when you smoked two cigarettes a little bit too quickly after one another and the second one just felt awful ? You get the gyst. Remember your worst cigarettes instead of fantasizing about your best.

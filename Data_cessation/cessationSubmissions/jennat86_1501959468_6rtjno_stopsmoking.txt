Almost 2 full weeks- some pleasant developments

Day 13 nicotine free with Chantix. 

 This week I've worked out 4 times (that's four more times than I worked out in the 6 months prior to quitting). My energy levels are amazing, and I'm breathing so much easier. I eat really healthy and flavorful foods that I never made the time to prepare before. I only have to wash my hair every third day or so, and this morning when I flossed my gums didn't bleed like they normally do. The experience was unbelievably pleasurable!


Today I went to visit clients in their homes after the gym. The first stop has someone who must smoke in a back room somewhere.  The second was lighting up right there as we talked. Neither time felt tempting or appealing. I drove away and blew my nose/ sprayed some perfume in my car, then took deep breathes with the windows down all the way home. Just glad not to be carrying that stench on me at all times.


I hope all the fellow quitters and the wish-to-be-quit lurkers are having a great day. This smoke free life can be frustrating,  but the rewards are totally worth it.

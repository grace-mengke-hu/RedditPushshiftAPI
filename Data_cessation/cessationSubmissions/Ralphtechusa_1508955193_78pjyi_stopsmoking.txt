Need advice

So to keeps things short I usually work Monday-thursday. Lately I've been getting overtime on Fridays for about two months, about that time I promised my girlfriend the next three-day weekend I would quit. The reason I want to do it that way is because everyone around me at work smokes which is incredibly hard to quit. I am going to try and quit this Friday work or not, but has anyone else have an issue like this? How do I quit when everyone around me smile all day?

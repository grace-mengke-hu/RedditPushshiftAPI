Day 13 not smoking cigarettes.

I have been a smoker for 11 years and i quit 12 days ago. People say the first 3 days are the hardest but actually I had serious cravings on day 11 and 12. I almost had one on day 12 but actually backed off reminding myself how my overall health improved just in that short period of time. I had painful calluses on my feet and they are definitely  disappearing which is making my life and job easier. Life feels amazing without addictions.

Day 25, but day 2 of stopping NRT. The cravings are back!

Day 25, but day 2 of stopping NRT and the cravings have returned. Nowhere near as strong though. I feel like I have almost broken the back of all the habits and the triggers are losing their powers...

- The morning smoke
- The smoke en route to the station
- The smoke before work
- The post lunchtime smoke
- The mid afternoon lag smoke
- The celebratory end of work smoke
- The drink with friends smokes

I must stay vigilant though, as I fear there are some still lurking!

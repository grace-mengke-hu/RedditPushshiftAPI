Quitting when spouse smokes

So it’s been a week since iv quit (vaping not cigs) I’m fine when I’m at work (I’m using the patch for now) but when I get home and my spouse is smoking I crave so bad. I get really irritable and mean to him I just can’t help it! Anyone else been in this situation? How can I make it easier?

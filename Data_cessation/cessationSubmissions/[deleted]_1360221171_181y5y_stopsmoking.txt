Breathing problems starting around day 24

For the past 5-7 days I have been gasping for air whenever I go for a long walk/hike. At first I thought maybe it was the humidity and the heat but now I think there is a problem. I am going to wait it out for another month hoping it is just part of the process but I wanted to know if anyone else is experiencing this.

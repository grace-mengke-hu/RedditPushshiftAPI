200 days tomorrow

The main reason why I quit smoking was because i took up running. When I started running, as clich√© as it sounds I kept saying "I need to stop smoking" due to how out of breath and difficult to breathe it was.

Now I'm able to run 4 miles and counting. I find cigarettes disgusting now and wonder how on earth smoking indoors is still a thing in some countries.

Not the most exciting of stories or opinions, but maybe exercise is also the answer to someones addiction out there.

Either way, I appreciate the time anyone may have took to read this. Have a good day everyone!

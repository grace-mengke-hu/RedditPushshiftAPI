22 days and I still wake up wanting to smoke

I still think about smoking every effin minute of the day.
I'm a nervous wreck and I lash out to my loved ones for no reason at all except that I am missing my smoke.

I started quitting in hospital (collapsed lung) and that was surprisingly easy. Now that I'm back home it kind of hits me that my home will never be the same again. 
I will never get to relax with a ciggy and reddit like I used to. Games will never feel the same (I used to calm down with a smoke when games got exciting ) Not to mention the after dinner feeling.

HALP! Can not do this alone!

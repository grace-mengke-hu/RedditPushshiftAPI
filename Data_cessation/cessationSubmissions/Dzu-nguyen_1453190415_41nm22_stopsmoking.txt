I do it again.

Due to a weak moment, I did relapse 10 days ago after being able to quit for 12 days.

12 days of quit is so tiny comparing to what everyone here is doing, but that was the best I have done for me during 12 days of smoking. And I have enjoyed and learnt so much from those 12 days.

During the last week, I had tried repeatly to quit again and failed in every attempt (all within 24 hours). Even now is one of the most stressful period of my life (approaching the edge of a divorce), I will continue to quit, and will do everything to make it sucessfully.

For the following days, I will engage regularly with all people here, as a task of my quit. Thanks all for all the encouragement and help to build such a wonderful community.

Best,
Du

A roller coaster I did not want to ride...

I'm on day four, it's a beautiful Monday morning and my mind is playing tricks on me. Telling me how shitty of a person I am, how when I graduate in May that I will fail at obtaining a respectable position. It's telling me that my girlfriend does not love me, that she's looking for another man. It's telling me that my father who is struggling with cancer will not make it. Day four, nicotine, go fuck yourself. I will not smoke today. Staying strong for myself.

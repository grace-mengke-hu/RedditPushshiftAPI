Trying this again...

I’m 32 and started smoking 20 years ago...holy crap. I’m an irregular smoker...can go days without a cigarette and sometimes just have one a day. Unless I fall off the wagon drinking like I did last night...then I smoke a lot. Anyway, I’ve tried the patch and it gives me nightmares, every ducking night. The gym makes me sick with migraines. What else is there?

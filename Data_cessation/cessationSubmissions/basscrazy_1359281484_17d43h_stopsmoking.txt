Eight days in, I am feeling amazing

Hi guys, I'm eight days into quitting, and I thought I'd give you guys an update and let you know how I'm doing!

Smoker for close to five years, 22 years old.

I am fantastic. I don't even really think about cigarettes anymore. I went out both Friday and Saturday nights, drank copious amounts of alcohol, and still did not want a cigarette. It is actually concerning how much of a shift I've undergone. Smokes smell terrible to me now. Is it odd that I really DON'T want a cigarette this early on?

Thank you to everyone who contributes on this subreddit. I really needed your guys help on the first couple days, and you guys encouraged me to pull through. Thanks a bunch!

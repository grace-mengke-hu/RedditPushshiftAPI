Current smokers vs us non-smokers

So, a couple of current smokers walked inside after smoking the same moment I walked into my work building (from another entrance) from a coffee run. The smelled horribly familiar to my past days. I thought to myself, I’m sooo glad I don’t smell like that anymore!! They then proceeded to ask me why I went outside without a jacket (they must have remembered me being a smoker). I proudly said to them I quit, and doing well! They gave “that” look, the one I used to give people who told me they quit in the past. I just laughed (internally) I know what they’re thinking.  Just more motivation for me to stay smoke free! I am starting to enjoy the challenge and win in my life. 

Keep it up all! One day / moment/ victory at a time!!

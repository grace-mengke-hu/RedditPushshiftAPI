For the fallout players out there

Going from being a smoker to a non-smoker is like transitioning your life  from 'survival' to 'very hard'. Life will still be difficult but you will feel rested after every sleep and your endurance and carry capacity will increase. 

Keep up the effort for anyone going through the tough times you'll get it.

Is it normal for nicotine gum to make your throat feel odd?

So I don't smoke, but I do dip chewing tobacco, about 3-4 cans a week. I'm looking to quit and I picked up a box of 4mg nicotine content gum. I noticed that when I chew it after a few minutes my throat starts to feel odd, almost like it's closed off or scratchy. Like a mix between having a cold and that feeling you get when you've cried too much. Is that normal? Could it be an allergic reaction or something? I'm not allergic to normal gum, and I'm not allergic to nicotine, so I can't imagine what else could be in there that might cause an allergic reaction. Is this normal or just something you have to get used to while you're using it?

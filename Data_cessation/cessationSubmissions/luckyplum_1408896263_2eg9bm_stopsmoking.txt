One year today!

A deep and heartfelt thanks to everyone on this board. If you're just starting, or struggling, know that it gets easier and so much better. My life has improved in every single way.

If you're still smoking and wondering how to get started, do yourself a favor and stop. Today. Don't be a slave anymore. No matter how hard it seems, you can do it. There's nothing special about me, and I did it. Never another puff.

At long last, I am finally free.

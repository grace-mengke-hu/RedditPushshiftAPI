Starting Day 1 Cold Turkey, tomorrow. #support

So, what's different this time--this forum to seek support when the going gets tough. I first puffed a cigarette when I was 11, and now I'm 31, with multiple bouts of "quitting" and "relapsing" throughout the years. In 2013, I switched to vaping, and it surprisingly "worked" to get me off tobacco, but obviously I was still hooked to nicotine. From 2013 - 2017 I probably ended up relapsing and smoking cigs for 1-2 months per year, but I wasn't too hard on myself as my overall health improved greatly with the switch to vaping.

This past April, my vape device blew up on me! yup, that happened. One of those not-so-freak, actually quite common, unadvertised, media-silenced accidents. I sustained some deep 2nd degree, borderline 3rd degree, burns to my abdomen and wrist (luckily my face and privates were safe... it was a bad situation, but gotta count your blessings!). I'm all healed now, but as you can imagine, I'm terrified to vape or use electronic devices. 

The dilemma--since April i've been smoking cigarettes again at about half to a full pack a day. During the healing process until now I gained a bunch of weight, overall feel a lot unhealthier, don't exercise as much because my head plays the game of "if i smoke, I can't be active",  and my relatively new girlfriend hates the smoking (potential deal-breaker, although she's trying to be understanding at the moment... not sure how long that will last).

Believe it or not, I managed to go to medical school and become an MD, and am applying for residency to be a general physician soon. This makes it all the worse... really knowing in gruesome, bloody details what the smoking does on all levels. It's time to quit. To quit quit. I hope to succeed and inspire some of you, and I hope to gain support in this process. Who wants to go to a doctor who smokes anyways!? 

Cheers! Good luck to all my fellow non-smokers!

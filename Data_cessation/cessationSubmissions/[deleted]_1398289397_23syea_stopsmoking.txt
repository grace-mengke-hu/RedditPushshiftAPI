Day 6...

So... today is day 6. Yesterday I had to have minor surgery on my back. Nothing serious... but it was stressful and slightly painful. When I left the surgery center... the first thing I thought as I went through the door was "cigarette". I'm not sure if it was the stress or that I was there for about two hours. But the craving was palpable.

The Chantix is doing its job... and very well I might add. But, the cravings still do come sometimes. 

That said, I've noticed a HUGE difference in my breathing and endurance in just 6 days. By the way, other than the Chantix I'm not using anything else. Nicotine free. But, yeah, I can walk farther and not get winded so quickly. The wheezing is nearly gone already. I'm still coughing here and there... but less frequently and intensely. I've only used my inhaler once this week.

Of course, I imagine I smell better too. My car smells better. This week the house keepers are coming to do a big Spring cleaning... going to get rid of as much of the cigarette smell in my house as I can. Have them washing all the drapes... clean the walls and carpet... do all the clothes and linens... everything. Can't wait.

Anyway... assuming the rest of today goes well... and I see no reason why it shouldn't... I'll be on day 7. One week. That's more time than I've had in a very long time.

So... :D

Very happy.

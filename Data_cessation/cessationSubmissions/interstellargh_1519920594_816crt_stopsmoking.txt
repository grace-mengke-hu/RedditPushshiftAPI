Anyone experience depression? Third week for me

I guess I don't get into a depressive state that much, I get anxiety and anxiety-depression linked, but never depression without anxiety. Right now, three weeks free of cigs, I have depression without anxiety.

Maybe because nicotine is a stimulant? And without that stimulant for this long, I'm feeling "deeper lows" or something?

Anyone experience this? I'm exercising like 4-5 times a week for about an hour each time. I have goals, seeing friends, good job, etc. I try to get 8 hours of sleep a night 

But wow I was feeling low yesterday and restless sleep and can't shake it this morning. Doom and gloom type of feelings. Worst of worst seems likely. Can't seem to get myself to do anything today. I had such a productive week too (and if you check my posts, I rave about how productive I've been since quitting!). But its like I crashed hard the past few days. Total 180 for me from the previous 3 weeks.

I don't even really crave cigarettes... last night when I was REALLY feeling it I had a drink-- maybe its alcohol or weed? I might be drinking/vaping weed more now that I'm not smoking cigs. I want my energy back :(

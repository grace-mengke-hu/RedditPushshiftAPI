Finally apart of this sub.. so far so good

My last cigarette was 7:30 am today, by this time, I would have had a total of 3 cigarettes. I'm nervous, and worried that I'll fail but I have to stay strong because I am ready. 

I'm almost 30, I'm getting married to my best friend in less than 90 days, I train religiously and I don't see how smoking ever fit into my life, but I made it fit. I love smoking, everything about it.. but I've smoked for almost 12 years now and you know what? I love me more. 

My last cigarette was 7:30 this morning.. and It will be my last.

Looking forward to the support here. Thanks

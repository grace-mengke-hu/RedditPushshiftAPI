Im determined.

I can't become the better version of myself tomorrow, without working on myself today! That's why I'm not smoking today. Day one. Having a craving right now but mostly posting here for accountability. I'm pretty amazed at the 16 or so smoke free hours I have currently so I know I can do more.

I'm a non smoker now. That's good!

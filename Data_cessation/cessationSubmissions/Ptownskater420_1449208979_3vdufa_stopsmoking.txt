3 days in

So I quit smoking cigs and weed 3 days ago. But I have had 1 cig per day since then. Don't know if it'll hurt me in the long run. But for now it's like I haven't smoked in the 3 days. My strategy is I wait until real late at night when the cravings are surreal and I just puff half a smoke and put it out. Cause it's a weird taste now and doesn't make me feel good but I smoke the one to calm the cravings. Before bed. But I have crazy insomnia so I'm usually up until 4-5 no problem. So I wait until around midnight to smoke that first one. I also signed up for a gym that I've been going to everyday this week. I can feel my lungs begin to breath more. Also not smoking weed had made my mind clear. Can't say it any more that weed does cause foggy minds. Only clarity work from now on. (On mobile forgive me)

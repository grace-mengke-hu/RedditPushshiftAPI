Even after 400 days I still think about it from time to time

So, 400+ days. I am so happy I have made it this far. 

I am happy that I no longer smell like stale tobacco and that I no longer need to find some time to break away from what ever I am doing to get a "quick" smoke in. 

I noticed that I still think about smoking every so often, its rare but I still think that maybe it wont be so bad.

I was watching House of Cards and it was one of the smoking scenes and it just looked so tasty. 

I then started thinking how the taste would be nasty and the smell would get to me if I was in the same room. I hate that I still want one every so often but I am glad I can keep away from it.

Thanks to everyone on this sub, every post is a motivation.

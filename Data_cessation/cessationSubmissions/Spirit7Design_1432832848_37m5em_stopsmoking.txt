Quitting Saturday

Well, I've decided to quit. I've never posted to reddit before, but I know I'll need to post somewhere to keep myself motivated. 

I've been smoking for...16 years (that's the first time I've counted it up, seems like a lot now) and I'm Finally ready to quit. I've recently taken up running, and I keep telling myself that I can do both, but deep down I know that is not the case. I'm tired of running out of breath after a mile.  

I have the support of my girlfriend and all of my close friends to help me through this, but I could use some tips to keep me motivated. I think the two hardest times to resist are going to be after a meal, and driving to and from work (I have a 45 minute drive one way), so if you have any suggestions, I'm all ears.

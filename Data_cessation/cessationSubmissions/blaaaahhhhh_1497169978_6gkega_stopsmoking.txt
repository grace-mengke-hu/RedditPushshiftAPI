I'm about 2.5 weeks into no smoking. Haven't had one and have no desire for one. Last few days I've been waking up with the taste in feel in my throat like I smoked 20 the night before, is that normal?

Smoked for 20 years, last 10 years I've been a twenty a day smoker.

When it started to noticeably affect boxing, running and general physical activity it was easy to just stop. Using. A vape with non nicotine juice in and just a couple of drops of nicotine, slowly weening off that too.

The last few nights I've been waking up with that feeling in the throat like after a day night of smoking the day before.

Also coughing up brown dots in my phlegm very often.

Is that normal?

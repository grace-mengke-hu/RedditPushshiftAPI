After 5 days quitting, I just requested a new badge

So I had given it up this past Sunday evening. I made it to early this morning and bought a pack. I brought them home and lit one up. Took 3 or 4 puffs and threw it away. It actually tasted utterly disgusting and I had no desire to have any more of it. I'm hoping it was only a small lapse, I do feel fine now and am not really craving it at all again so far.

Edit: something so weird though, I guess now I do feel a slight craving, but it's not really for a cigarette. It's like there's a disconnect from the joy I got from sucking on a smoke since it tastes revolting now.

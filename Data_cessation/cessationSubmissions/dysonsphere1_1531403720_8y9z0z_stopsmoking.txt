15 Days and counting and thinking...

I'm at that point where I can forget about cigarettes for hours at a time. Just totally forget that I ever smoked or that I wish I were smoking. Then for some reason, like I'm driving or bored,  I will remember I used to have that terrible habit that was slowly taking my health and money.  Not only that but filling my car and home with smoke residue and ash. That's when I get angry. Because I think back of all the times I tried to quit, for years now, and then I would just simply allow myself to smoke another cigarette and then another and another. I didn't believe that I could do it. And obviously I could all along. So much time wasted smoking. I hope you guys have a great day!

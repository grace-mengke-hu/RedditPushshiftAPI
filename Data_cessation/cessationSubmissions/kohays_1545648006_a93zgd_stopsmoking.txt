Insomnia.

I'm on day 2 of no smoking nicotine, I was using vuse ecigs and juuls pretty much a couple times a week for a few months but I've decided to stop for good. Yesterday I took a klonopin and fell asleep easily but tonight I took melatonin and only got about an hour. I'm tired but I feel like I can't fall asleep. My body just gets antsy in one position. Will this eventually go away?

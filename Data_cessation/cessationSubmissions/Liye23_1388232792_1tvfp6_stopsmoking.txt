It's almost been a month

Since I quit, I'm using chantix and it seems to be going fairly well, but the cravings now seem to be worse then in the first two weeks.  What do you do to distract yourself from the cravings? 

I haven't given in to the urge, but I sure want to! I think oh I have an e-cig I can hit that, but the rational part of my brain goes..no that's still nicotine and putting it back into your body is bad.

I like that no one at my new job knows me as a smoker

Once again, I would’ve been the only one. This ain’t college, where you’d step outside for a cigarette and two people would follow you and you’d join another crowd of 2–3. Instead of making friends in a smoker’s circle, I’d just be that one guy puffing away before and after work and twice on lunch breaks. Smoking really isn’t cool, I guess, and that message seems to have gotten across.

I'm glad I'm not stinking up the office. My desk is near the bathroom, and I'm so happy that every single person who has to use the restroom all day long isn't passing through / near my Pigpen cloud of cigarette stench.

There’s not even an outdoor trash can or an ashtray on the premises, let alone like … a smoking area / bench. I’d be like standing out in the sun in the middle of the parking lot and keeping butts in my car or some sad crazy shit like that.

Yeah. I’m really glad that’s not my life anymore.

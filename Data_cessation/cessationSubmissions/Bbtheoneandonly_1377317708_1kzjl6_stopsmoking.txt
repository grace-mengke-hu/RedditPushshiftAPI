Breaking out of my little routines.. Help?

I have a problem having a cigarette routinely

Right before a shower..
Break at work..
Driving..
After eating..

I'll average about 5-7 a day when I have them and when I don't, I can make it for the majority of the day, however when I get my hands on the next pack I play catch up on nicotine sometimes smoking 3 within a 30 min. Period.

What can you give me as advice to break out of this nasty habit?

I tend to believe I have an addictive personality with not only smoking but video games, etc. Anything I enjoy I tend to abuse for some time that it can start to take over daily.

Weight gain :(

Hello everyone, I've been over a month cigarette-free now!

I used to have an eating disorder (I started smoking to lose weight). I got healthy again and gained weight up into the healthy regions. Since I've quit I've felt heavier, my chin has a tell tale sliver of fat underneath.... It's making me panic. I want to be healthy all around - in the weight AND lung department.

What healthy lifestyle changes have people done to keep any excess weight off? 


Edit: I have a meal plan at the moment that I don't want to change (I was eating nothing but peanut butter on toast for ages. Now I've planned cooked meals with plenty of fruit and veg). I'm also planning on starting the couch-to-5-k running programme because it seems like it'd be a good amount of exercise. Thoughts?

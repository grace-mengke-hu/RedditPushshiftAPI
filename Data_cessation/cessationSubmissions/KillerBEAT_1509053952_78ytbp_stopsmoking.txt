Relapsed after 4 months

Quit cold turkey may 28th; some extremely stressful times have come up in my life recently when I decided to buy a pack of cigars. Now a week later I'm smoking half a pack. Trying not to be too hard on myself as I reset my quit date. But I was doing so well managing my stressors until one day it just became too much to handle. 

So how did you all deal with relapses if they happened?

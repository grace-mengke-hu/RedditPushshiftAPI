What do you mean others want me to succeed?

I can't be trusted just yet to not buy ciggs, if I have money. Took my son to get a haircut, hub gave me 20 dollars. Change after tip was 7. The perfect number to buy a pack, and a lighter.

I called him, and he stayed on the phone with me until I got home (about 20 minutes.)

He said if that's what it takes to be my rock, he'd do it.

I am very fortunate that my husband doesn't (has never) smoke(d). I cannot imagine what you guys are going through if your S/O smokes and you're trying to quit.

I realize just how important having someone during a craving is, now. I love you guys for being there for me when I don't have anyone around. If anyone needs an ear, and doesn't want to post publically... I am on my computer all the time. Message me.

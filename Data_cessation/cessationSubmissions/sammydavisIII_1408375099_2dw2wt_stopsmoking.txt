10 days and here's what's worked for me.

I've tried to quit before and I'd make it a day or two, but the next time I'd be at the bar or having a drink I'd be right back at it. I tried differently this time. Instead of just removing cigarettes from my normal routine, I'd try a complete 180. No cigarettes, booze, red meat, sugary snacks or sodas. Without these, the cravings aren't nearly as bad.  (If it makes a difference I was smoking the little cigars for the last few months I smoked)

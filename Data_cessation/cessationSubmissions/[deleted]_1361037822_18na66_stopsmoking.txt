Thank you!

I just want to say thank you so much to everyone on this subreddit. After seeing all of the comments about how great Allen Carr's Easyway book is, I decided to start reading it yesterday. I'm only on chapter six and am therefore still smoking some, but I now have such a hatred for the things, and for tobacco companies, that I feel once I finish reading it I will be done for good this time. That chapter hit me with such a mind-blowing realization and it honestly made me cry because I was so angry at myself for falling into that trap. I plan on having the rest of it read within the next few hours. So thanks again everyone!

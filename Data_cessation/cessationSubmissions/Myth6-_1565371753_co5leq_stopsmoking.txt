C.H.A.N.G.E

Hey guys,

Just wanted to share this as I just finished a meditation session and for some reason the word **change** as an abbreviation came into my mind and it felt really powerful and I feel some of you can take it with you. Literally all of the words to make up this acronym came one by one in order, and I just had to share this.

**C**hallenge. Challenge yourself to be better. Nothing easy comes without challenge. Compete with yourself.

**H**ear. Hear your thoughts, don't distance yourself from them. Your subconscious will always be with you, train it accordingly.

**A**ccept. Accept your current state. Stoner for 20 years or 2 years? Let yourself know where you are, but understand this is only temporary.

**N**ow. Understand the power of now. Get rid of the 5 minute mentality, and do things now. Don't have your last bowl tomorrow, have it now.

**G**oals. Set goals for yourself. Set a 7 day sober goal. Beat it. Set one for 30 days. Beat it. Set a final destination goal and work backwards from there with little goals that will help reach that final destination.

**E**xplore. Explore the person you really want to be. Explore new thoughts. New hobbies. New friends. New environments. Nothing will change if you quit a habit and keep the same shitty lifestyle that went along with it.

Today, August 9th is Day 31 of meditating twice daily, Day 29 of being weed free, and Day 25 of being Nicotine free. I hope I can inspire just one of you to C.H.A.N.G.E for the better and congratulations/thank you to those who constantly inspire others in this sub, including myself.

Quitting Advice

I'm a perpetual nail-biter, and I always need something to do with my hands.  If it includes putting something in my mouth, that's all the better.  Freud would have a field day watching me and my oral fixation.

At any rate, I've been trying to quit on and off for what feels like forever, and I can't quite deal with being in a situation where I don't have something to do with my hands.  I was hoping that somebody had the same problem, and could offer some advice about what to do to overcome this problem.

It's the last thing that keeps me smoking, which I hate more and more as the days go by.  I'm having a child in the Spring, and I've resolved that Daddy (weird to even type that) won't be a smoker.

Any advice would be helpful.  What did/do you do with your hands?

Becoming emotionally cold after quitting?

Hi Folks,

I've tried quitting a couple of times before; the first time was cold turkey and I made it 3 weeks. The second time was with champix, and while I did lose the urge to smoke, the disturbing dreams made me stop taking the pills, and after 1.5 weeks, I was back on cigarettes.

In both cases, I seemed to emotionally shut down, became completely cold to those I love and care for (to the point where they said it was scary), and also became very very angry at the slightest thing. I felt like a sociopath, and manipulated myself and others into getting a fix :(

I quit alcohol in 2007, and it was easy compared to quitting cigarettes.

I can't use gum as I have braces, the sprays and meltlets feel like knives in my throat, and my skin is so sensitive that patches are both painful and give me blisters. My only option is to quit cold turkey :(

I've just thrown my smokes into the bin, and as of about 20 minutes ago, I'm officially quit, but I'm terrified it's just going to be a repeat of the last two times I tried, with me failing spectacularly and hurting those around me in the process, and in the end, just feeling like a failure. I have a fairly major operation coming up in December, and I absolutely have to have quit smoking well before then, so maybe this time will be different... I hope this time will be different.

Has anyone else experienced similar loss of emotion a couple of weeks post quit? How did you deal with it? Does it get better?

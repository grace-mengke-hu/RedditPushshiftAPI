Please help me not smoke when I get home!

Guys, I've lost count over how many times I've had to reset my badge. I've just sent a request to remove it again. I smoked again today morning, before leaving for work. I'm about to leave from work back home in about an hours time. 

I'm scared I'll give in once I get home. I need some really quick advice. What do I do once I get home, to remove the need to smoke. I should mention that I don't feel like the day is 'complete' unless I have my smoke once I'm home from work. That's the one thing I look forward to. There's nothing else that takes it's place, gaming, watching a movie, sex, food, whatever. So, I don't know what to do. 

Please, please help!

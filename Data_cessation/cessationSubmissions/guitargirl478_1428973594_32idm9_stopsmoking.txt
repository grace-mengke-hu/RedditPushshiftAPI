6 Months and Counting!

I quit the week before Thanksgiving. I am a singer and I started really feeling the effects of smoking in my throat. It was sore and tight and dry and singing was painful. I decided if I wanted to keep doing the thing I loved the most in the world, I'd have to quit. It's been almost 7 months now and while I miss it sometimes, I would miss the way that my vocal chords have healed up more. Don't wait to quit. Believe in yourself and make the choice to take back your life. I stay subscribed to sub because I love seeing all the stories of triumph. Thank you all for your indirect support. You are wonderful!

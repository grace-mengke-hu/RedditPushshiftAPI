Stopsmoking, I need your help.

I do not smoke myself. But my dad has been smoking a pack and a half everyday for the last 47 years. He has a family history of heart disease and early death, so I am especially concerned for him. He claims to smoke because it makes him tolerable to be around and "Reduces his stress."  I think those are BS excuses for him to continue smoking. He has tried e-cigs, but claims they are worse for him than smoking. I want to know if there is anything I can do to convince him to stop or even begin to curb his addiction.

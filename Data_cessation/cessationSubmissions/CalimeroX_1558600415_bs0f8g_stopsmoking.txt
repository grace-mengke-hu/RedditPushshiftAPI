100 days without nicotine

Hey everyone, I just wanted to share my story because I am really happy about it and maybe it can help some people to stop smoking. 

I'm in my mid twenties, and I have smoked for roughly 10 years, yes I started pretty early. Last summer I switched to a vape and reduced my cigarette smoking, I still vaped a lot tho, so the nicotine intake was still there. In early February I started my semester abroad in Australia (I'm from Europe). For those who don't know: Liquid containing nicotine is illegal here, and in the state I am in vapes are not for sale at all. Cigarette prices here are insane, like 5 times the price of western europe, it's crazy.

So the morning of my flight to Australia came and I thought about just putting my vape in, hoping for the best. Transiting through Abu Dhabi, another region where vapes are illegal, made me kinda nervous tho, so I decided to leave it at home.

And off I went, roughly 24 hours later I arrived in my student apartment in Australia, and I haven't smoked since. The anxiety about this adventure and seeing / experiencing so much  new stuff completely took my mind off of smoking. I still have some small cravings some times, mainly after eating.. I was so used to smoking after eating, it was really weird at first and somehow it felt like I was missing "closure" of my meals. I have dreamed dozens of times of me smoking, each time being so disappointed in my self for throwing away the long time without, having to restart from 0.

I hadn't planned on quitting, but the moment just presented itself and I had to take it.

Soon I will have to go back home, and I hope I can resist and won't fall back then.

tl;dr: 100 days smoke free, just wanted to share. Good luck and stay strong to everyone, especially those in the early days of  quitting!

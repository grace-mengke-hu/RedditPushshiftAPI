I am thankful for this website and it has been extremely helpful for me since I quit smoking. I quit on 8/22/2015 and feel like I'm regaining my life back. Something that has been helpful for me was putting a bunch of cigarette butts in a mason jar and being able to see how nasty it is. I smoked for 16 years and am done, done, done. I believe this to be one of the most important accomplishments thus far in my life. I'm grateful to have chosen to stop smoking.

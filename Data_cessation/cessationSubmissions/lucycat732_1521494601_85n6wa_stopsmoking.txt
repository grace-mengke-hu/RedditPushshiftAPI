I made it through SXSW!

I was very nervous about my annual pilgrimage to Austin for SXSW. Typically it's a real smoke-fest for me. But honestly, it wasn't nearly as difficult as I thought it would be. And I'm not saying this in a braggy way like "Oh look how strong I am." I'm saying this because I think we all have way better willpower and mental strength than we give ourselves credit for. And we let smoking have an artificial hold over us long after it actually does (i.e. nicotine is expelled from your body relatively quickly, so that's not really what's trying to pull you back in). In your moments of weakness, just try to remind yourself that you are stronger than this addiction. All you have to do is NOT SMOKE and you will be so proud of yourself. I genuinely expected to cave last week, but now that I am on the other side I feel like a million bucks. Keep thinking about how much better you will feel when you make it through these hard times. The "good" feeling you get from smoking is so temporary, but the pride you will get from holding fast to your quit will grow and swell with each day.

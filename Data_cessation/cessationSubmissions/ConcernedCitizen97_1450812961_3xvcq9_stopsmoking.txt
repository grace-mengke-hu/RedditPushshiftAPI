This is my 2nd time trying to quit and it is totally different from the first. This is why.

I'm going to start off by saying that I have not smoked in three days and I don't want to sound like I am bragging, but it has been way too easy so far.

I have not used any nicotine replacement products or anything marketed for smokers.

What I have done that has helped compared to the first time I have tried quitting.

1. Every time I have felt the urge to smoke, I go to my own personal smoke spot (My window. I know, it's a greasy habit) and take sips of water and stare at the view just like I did when I smoked. I realized that not only was I addicted to tobacco, I was addicted to using it as an excuse to gather my thoughts and enjoy the view. Usually if I am not doing anything I try to find something to act on. Smoking gave me the excuse to take a step back. 

2. I started taking supplemental magnesium. It might give the cutting-edge to stopping smoking. Nicotine activates the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which stops anxious thinking and the brain from being stimulated to a degree. Once you stop smoking the brain becomes overly stimulated as your nicotinic acetylcholine receptors receptors are working overtime. Leading to aggression and anxiety for example. Magnesium blocks the calcium ion channels that are responsible for the excessive stimulation and lets you function and chill properly. It is also a great supplement for non-smokers with anxiety and heart issues!

Hope I helped!

Feeling positive

So day 6..... woken up with an irritating cough, haven't had a proper craving since Friday but I'm not letting my guard down for a second! Actually enjoying being a non smoker. Randomly I'm finding it much easier to get up in the mornings, starting to feel good on the inside and outside 👍 have a good day all xx

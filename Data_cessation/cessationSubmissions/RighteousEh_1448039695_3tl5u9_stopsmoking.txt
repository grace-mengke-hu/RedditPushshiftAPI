This is going to be brutal.

So I'm working at a restaurant right now and I hear Christmas time around here is hectic as shit. After two days of no smoking I made the mistake of stepping out with a co-worker this morning. People are pretty open-handed with their smokes here and as much as I want to tell them not to indulge me, I feel like I have to do this myself. Combined with the shoddy amount of sleep I'll be getting, I feel this will be a rough ride.

Also having asthma, this seems like a no-brainer but my weaselly mind keeps trying to get out of it. I'm only at a pack every two weeks right now but give it time and it'll get worse. Any advice or support is more than welcome. Don't hold back. Thanks guys!

Almost 48 hours in.. Just some random thoughts

My original post is [here](http://redd.it/2byjs8)

  Decided to not use an e-cig after all. The Allen Carr video really changed me and gave me the motivation to make this happen.

  I went on a long walk after work yesterday evening. I usually never leave the house unless I need something from the store. It was nice to get out and clear my head a little. 

  I still think about lighting up quite a bit. The urges have been getting somewhat less frequent. I know that if I do, I start over at zero. And I am told that zero through 72 is the hardest part. 

  When I wake up in the morning, it seems like the urge is non existent.  As the day progresses, the urges come and go. It is the most rough after I eat a meal.

  At home, I sometimes feel bored and at that time is when urges start becoming more pronounced. I try to keep my mind occupied. I am a gamer. I enjoy constantly thinking about how to solve a problem. It almost feels like not smoking is making it more difficult to focus on things that I want to.

  In the end, I am determined. Allen Carr's video literally made me cry when he finally convinced me that I used to smoke for absolutely no reason. Literally no reason at all. And I won't go back.

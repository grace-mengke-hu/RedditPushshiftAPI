Second day quitting cigarettes, extreme withdraw?

Note: I am supplementing the transition from cigarettes by vaping. I got a Voopoo Mojo 80w mod with a mixture of 18mg and 6mg flavors (blend of pg and the other kind). Used to smoke a pack of Marlboro a day for about 10 years. Last night I had night sweats and some crazy vivid nightmares which is unusual for me. Today I woke up with flu-like symptoms, headache weak joints and some nausea and minor dizziness. I seriously feel like I won't be getting out of bed at all.

I don't feel like I crave a cig, the vape does a great job at delivering nic. Am i getting too much nic and experiencing a mild overdose, or is this withdraw from the other thousands of chemicals in cigs? Last time I quit I didn't feel this terrible but that was years ago.  Once I get through this phase I'm definitely going to slowly reduce nic levels until I'm at 0, this is the best I can do but man this is horrible.

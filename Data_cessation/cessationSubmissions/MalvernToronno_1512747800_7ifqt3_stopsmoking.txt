Trying to quit after oral surgery for implants

Hello everyone,

I have been smoke free for more than 24 hours. I had some minor oral surgery yesterday for dental implants and I need to not smoke for it to heal properly and not risk them failing. I've sent a lot of money on this procedure. I was born with missing teeth.

I've been a smoker for almost 15 years. I guess my heaviest has been last few years at about a pack every 3 days.

I guess I'm just posting for some advice and tips to keep going smoke free. I don't have any cravings right now but I'm afraid once the soreness and discomfort goes away from the mouth I'll want a cigarette.

PSA: Be careful not to let new addictions replace old ones.

I've been drinking more since quitting 4+ months ago. I just realized I just went through a fifth of bourbon in three days(Monday to Wednesday). While many will think this is not a lot, it is significantly higher than before quitting cigs. I'm going to stop drinking for awhile. 

Edit: thanks for the suggestions to start a good habit. I've been wanting to make a serious run at meditation, probably going to try that.

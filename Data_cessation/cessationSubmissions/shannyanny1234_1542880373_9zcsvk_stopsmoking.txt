Quit Zits???? Please can someone help!

Hello, 

So i recently give up smoking after smoking for 8 years (2 weeks ago) i used a vape for the first week with 0.0 nicotine now im  on nothing and feeling great! No cravings, nothing!!! However I am having the worse acne breakout of my life! Litterally have at least 15 cysts on my face and have 3-5 new red bumps poping up everyday! I have always suffered with acne which i believe to be from a hormone imbalance with im currently treating with estroblock, which was working up till now! Im so anxious i cant leave the house :( My self confidence with my skin was already at a all time low and now I just cant put into words how im feeling. Please can someone offer their stories if you expeianced acne when quitting! The last thing i want to do is go back to the death sticks as I dont think i will ever smoke again but feeling extremly discouraged tright now :(

Zyban users

It's time for me to come off of Zyban but through discussions with my doctor, we decided it might be best for me to wait until after Christmas. However, I'm now forgetting to take it. How bad is it coming off? It was a bit rough to start with & I was on a huge emotional meltdown until things seemed to stabilize after 10 days. Is it the same the other way round? I'm just trying to figure out if I should just wean myself off or continue with the original plan & come off after Christmas.
Any advice is welcome. Thanks in advance.

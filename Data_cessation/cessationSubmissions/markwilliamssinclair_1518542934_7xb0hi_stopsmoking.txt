My wife has trained as a Cognitive Hypnotherapist to help people quit smoking

My wife is a qualified Cognitive Hypnotherapist and can help people to stop smoking. We're keen to get the word out there so would be great to have some suggestions of where to post about this, etc.    
     
We're both very passionate about helping people to quit smoking, as we're both former smokers who quit together on 23rd December 2016.
  
If you want to give it a try, here's her [website](http://lsw-london.com/smokingcessation.html). I'm sure we can arrange a discount for fellow Redditors. Sessions can be in-person if you live in London (UK) or can be via Skype/Google Hangouts, etc.

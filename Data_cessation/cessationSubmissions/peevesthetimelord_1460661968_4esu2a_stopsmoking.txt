I saw a discarded cigarette on the stairs of my office building this morning, and I smiled.

I smiled, because as I looked at that disgusting little piece of litter, I remembered that I am fortunate enough to no longer be inhaling the contents of one just like it into my lungs. I am no longer throwing away my paycheck to fund my declining health, and I am no longer a person who stinks up the air and throws trash around wherever I go. I keep having this experience of seeing a cigarette or a smoker and smiling, because I am so happy that I do not want a cigarette and that I am not a smoker. 
I have been stressed out recently and not always in the best mood. I have found a trick to make myself smile instantly: I remind myself that even though I may feel terrible about some inconvenience or stressor right now, I can celebrate the fact that I'm still not a smoker, and that tomorrow I will continue that.

I'm trying to follow Allen Carr's book, but I'm having some difficulty

Hi all,

To keep it brief: I read Allen Carr's book that was recommended on the sub on Thursday night. I loved most of everything he said, even though it was somewhat patronizing and slightly misogynistic. It was so powerful that I, who have smoked a pack every day, for 8 years, have now just quit cold turkey. I pity smokers now. I live my life as a non-smoker. 

I'm having some difficulties though and I'm feeling guilty. Carr's book made me feel like I'm "not doing it right" by struggling with wanting a cigarette. I feel weak. I took a tiny vacation this weekend and now am back in my house where I used to chainsmoke all the time. It's so haunting. Ugh. I won't smoke tonight, or tomorrow for that matter...I just feel kind of lost. 

TLDR: At first the book worked, and now it feels like it's not and I'm feeling guilt tripped.

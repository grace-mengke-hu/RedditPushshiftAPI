What would you do

This is week 3 (or week 2 if you count the slip of 2 cigarettes I had while drunk 2 weeks ago). I am using NRT and sometimes I vape when I really feel like a cigarette. Now the thing is 2 nights ago I went swimming and as per usual I lost the patch. I usually put it back in the morning and proceed with my life as per normal. But I forgot to put it, so I decided to wait until I got home and start again today. But I'm on the tube now and I forgot it. Should I buy some and put it when I get to work ? Should I just wait and put one tomorrow?
Should I stop completely ?

I am in a very stressful situation at the moment so I am afraid of doing something stupid and giving in again if I quit taking the patches

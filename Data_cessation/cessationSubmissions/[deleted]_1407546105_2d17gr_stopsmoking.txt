Almost a week!

Tomorrow marks day 7! So far I have survived a fight with the fiance, my work audit, being written up, the smoking dreams (though I did throw them away in my dream!) and getting drunk. I think if I can make it through the float trip this weekend, I will be okay!  I have been using a vaporizer with 0% nicotine juice in it, which has been helping.

Just wanted to check in and say hi!

3 Weeks!!!

Well it's been just about 3 weeks since I quit smoking! I smoked for 18 years! I didn't quit by choice, I quit after having an ablation done for SVT. When I got home from the hospital, the thought of smoking grossed me out so I didn't! I do feel like I miss it, but I know I'm better off without them. I read Allen Carr's book also!

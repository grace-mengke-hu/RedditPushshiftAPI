Nine days, and I feel pretty good!

I smoked cigarettes for about a year, typically four or so a day, sometimes as much as a pack, depending on the day. On the college I'm attending, probably 30% of the students smoke, which makes it very easy to get a cigarette. It's been my downfall several times, as this is probably the twentieth time I've tried to quit.

I got in a terrible argument with my SO two weeks ago over the habit, and during the period afterward where she didn't want much to do with me, I found this subreddit and it's been so incredibly helpful- I scroll through posts and I see people that are going through the exact same thing that I am, and it's so incredibly heartening. 

I just wanted to thank each and every one of you.

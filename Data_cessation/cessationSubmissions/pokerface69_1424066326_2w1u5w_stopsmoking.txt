I hate myself so much :(

Ô∏èHi

I have been sober for some 20ish days and I almost slipped right now. 
I think the only thing that saved me was unavailability of the cigs. 

I have been travelling since Friday and got mild stomachache. Idk why but it brought back the cravings on a wholly new level. 

I managed to pass thru them somehow but right now im returning back to my town and when I reached airport OMG the craving went overboard. it was like nothing I had felt before. My legs were automatically walking towards the smoke room but luckily there was no cig shop outside the smokeroom and I'm too shy of a person to ask someone from smoke room for a cig. 

I think this is the only reason I din smoke. 
Now the cravings has suppressed and I'm feeling so bad that I almost caved.... 
Im loving the non smoker life , I can smell everything , my head is clear always without any smoke and whenever I come near anyone who has smoked they stink so bad.

Any helps on how to cope these 20+ days cravings?
I don't even want one smoke but during that craving one smoke was only thing I could think about.

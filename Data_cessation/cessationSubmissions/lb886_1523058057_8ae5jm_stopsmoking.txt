My motivation to stay quit... can’t back down now!!

I signed up to run in a 10K in Hawaii in December in support of Diabetes Canada. My goal is to raise $6,500 for the cause.. and just to generally do well in the race. I can’t run for shit currently. My story about why I’m running is about my quitting/getting healthy, and also having the goal of raising the money for a good cause. Now that some co-workers, friends and family have donated and are all thrilled about my quitting...there’s no way I’m turning back!!! 

I signed up for this over a week ago but didn’t really tell anyone about it till today cause the addict in me was saying I wasn’t done yet and not to make it real ... glad I didn’t listen to the fear and I started the fundraising campaign. I’m in 100%! Ahh

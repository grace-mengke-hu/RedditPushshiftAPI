I just want to vent, I recently gave up my juul. Long after cigarettes and it just sucks right now.

It’s been a week for me, I’m really fucking pissed of fat the world. My SO is supporting me and my friends are behind me as well. Thing is, is that I gave up smokes and went to vaping, then to juuls. I gave up my juul to my friend who doesn’t vape as often and it’s just really irritating and frustrating to be around them bc they won’t let me get a puff. I hate everything. I can’t sleep right, I can’t wake up right, I can’t stay up during classes, I can’t even shit like i used to. 

I feel like I should get a puff, because it was formerly my juul? We pass it around all the time when drinking or before I tried quitting. I understand that they want the best for me but I am just so frustrated with everything. I started getting multiple dreams a night where it’s just me trying so hard to get to hit a juul, splitting wires to force a connection, stealing them from the store, and just having one and hitting it. From habit I still look around for it in my pockets, hoping that it would magically appear. Hearing it being puffed from is enough to make me irritated. I can see I’m not the same person as I was when I was using a juul, but it really does feel like hell. 

I really want to go and buy a pack of smokes, Ive started over so many times, Cigarettes to juul and quit then back to cigarettes. I’ve tried. I’m really upset but I made a promise to my SO to not smoke a cigarette. I know it sounds silly about this juul and the extent of my withdrawals. But this has been hell for me.

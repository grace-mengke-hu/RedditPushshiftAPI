In September I quit smoking. It messed me up, bad stuff happened. I'm now 1 month, 10 days smoke free.

I'll explain. Tl;Dr at the bottom. I'm 23, smoked from 14-19.5.  Gave it up for my ex. Started at 21, after we split and immediately went to a pack and a half. But then cut back...

But I made this post to hopefully shed some light on the difficulties of quitting, and what it truly can mean/do to people that struggle.

Bad stuff first.

So it's September. I'm struggling with massive depression and severe isolation. Been in therapy for that plus other stuff for a long, long time. Gradually getting worse, and worse. I lived with my brother and sister in law, both of them I never saw due to different shifts. I was smoking way too much, pack a day at my lowest + pack and 3/4ths at the highest, was waking up due to my breathing stopping, and I could hardly walk up a set of stairs. At 23, I know right? Bleh!

I decided enough was enough. I'd put it off too long, and kept saying "this is the last one" and "no *this* is the last one" over and over. 

I stopped. Finally. Cold turkey... Huge mistake #1.

I have a very unstable life, admittedly. I used smokes as a coping mechanism for everything. When I gave that up... I kindof went crazy. 

Literally. 

I went to work, had an emotional breakdown and was sent home. That day I went to the doc for antidepressants. Mistake #2! Just a regular doc, not a psychiatrist. I was put on a medication that fucked. me. up. It made my "I don't care to be alive" thoughts into "I want to die" thoughts. I switched meds the next week. No change. Then switched to a third that week. All this time I wasn't cleared for being back at my job (I transport people, and the meds had a risk of drowsiness amongst other stuff, bosses didn't want that risk).

I was on the third med for two days... Then... Well... I attempted suicide, mistake #3, I know. I was sent to an ER, sent to a psych facility, and my first actual night there I attempted to kill myself again *in the facility*. Mistake #4. Like I said, I went fucking crazy! (Not entirely from quitting, but the stress build up suuuuccckkkssss!)

I was still on the third medication that entire time. I spent time in there, then some time off work staying with my parents who were living with my sister. I lived on the couch, and used my car as a closet. (Folks wouldn't let me live anywhere else, refused to let me be alone. Smart move actually, I still had plans...)

For three months.

Bad news over. Yay. Yay! 

The meds I'm on don't help much mentally, but! that third medication is called Wellbutrin XL. It's an antidepressant and smoke cessation med. It got me to the point where I forgot to smoke for hours. The only time I lit up was when I actually thought about it. On my last day of smoking, I only smoked 3 or 4 cigs all day. I figured if I was that low, what's the point? 

So I quit. Three weeks later, began the Couch to 5k program. I have stopped it, for now, due to my legs having issues (shin splints are awful!). But I ran 2.5 miles last Wednesday. Each mile was about 14:30 in time. For having smoked a pack a day two months prior? That's pretty awesome I think.

Am I 100% mentally? Fuck no. But am I 100% able to take a deep breath, smell flowers from 5 feet away, smell myself after a good shower (seriously, I smell amazing and not like smoke!)...? Goddamn right I am 100%. It's fucking amazing.

I couldn't do it without Wellbutrin XL. It may not be the 'I'm a badass' way as cold turkey is. But it works for me and that's all that matters. I hope to, soon, be able to run 5k without issue and hopefully get my mental state much more manageable.

If I can go through the hell that was the last three months, and STILL quit smoking, I'm sure **you can too**. Maybe Wellbutrin, or chantix, or an e cig isn't as "badass" as cold turkey. But if it works, it works! And you can say you made it a month soon, too! 

So don't give in to the habit! Don't give in to the smoke! Tell that pack of cigs to go straight to hell! Just make it to week 2.5, and you'll be able to smell like you never thought possible! And remember, it's a hell of a thing to quit. But once you do? 

**It's. So. Worth. It.**

Tl;Dr - quit smoking in September. Went crazy. Literally. Tried to kill myself twice. Started an antidepressant that is also a smoke cessation. Forgot to smoke. Quit smoking. Ran 2.5 miles last Wednesday at 14:30 minute miles. Am I 100% mentally? Fuck no. Am I 100% able to do things I never could (run, smell things, not reek of smoke)...? Goddamn right I am 100%. Hope to run a 5k and get my mental stuff in order too. Don't give in! You can beat this! You! Yes, **you**! **You. Can. Beat. This.**

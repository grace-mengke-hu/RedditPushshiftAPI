Having a lot of cravings, 12 days in, feel like once I move out I'll go right back to it

I'm a 20 year old college student and picked up smoking this year due to a lot of personal problems. I smoked for about 8 months and had around 10 cigarettes a day. I quit cold turkey twice during that time and the throat pain was so bad (not sure why that happens to me and not others) that I picked up smoking just to get rid of it. I am now on my furthest streak.

I quit because I moved back in to my parents for the summer, I'll be moving out in about 3 months and I'm afraid that with my roommate who will smoke and with the pressures of work and college, I'll go right back to smoking. I almost feel like giving up already and becoming someone who smokes when he goes out at night, but not in the day.

All of my friends are comics and I do standup comedy about 4 times a week, they all smoke (seriously, all of them) and that makes it even more difficult.

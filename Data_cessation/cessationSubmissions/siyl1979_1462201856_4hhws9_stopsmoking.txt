Today marks 2 years smoke free, so I was wondering.. How would YOU describe life without cigarettes?

The words that come to mind most often are "freedom" and "clean."  But I'll admit, I still miss smoking like I miss an old friend- I think about it now and then, longing to reconnect.  It just shows the incredible power nicotine had on my life.  So I'm curious, where are you on your journey?

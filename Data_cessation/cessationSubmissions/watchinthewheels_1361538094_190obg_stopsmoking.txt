can someone recommend me a good android app for stat tracking?

I'm currently steeling myself for giving up (4th times a charm!) and was planning on setting myself a goal of saving enough money to buy a nexus 10 tablet as a bit of encouragement. It costs about Â£350 so it works out as just under 2 months (hopefully the cravings are mostly dead by then!).

I was wondering if there is a good app out there that will track my progress towards this goal. I used one before that was pretty generic one that had savings and things, but I would like to be able to say I'm 75% of the way there or whatever. It would also be nice to see the actual money counting up in real time. Is there anything out there that you guys have tried that's like this?

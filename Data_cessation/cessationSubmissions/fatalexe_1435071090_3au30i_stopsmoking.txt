Long camping trip around smokers was rough.

Lately I've really been considering taking up smoking again.  I keep telling myself that after three years I can be a responsible smoker and have a puff on weekends out by the campfire.  Unfortunately this is so far from the truth.  I know that I'll always be one puff away from two packs a day, but I can't seem to get that itch out of my head.  Even went so far as to pick up some smokes for people while I went on an ice run into town.  First pack of cigarettes I've bought in three years.  I was offered one and I wanted to so bad but deep down I just couldn't do it.  I was so grumpy the whole time out sitting around the campfire after then, just couldn't relax or be happy.  Everything people were doing was wrong to me and I was just  a sore guy to be around.  I wish I could just not think about it or get nostalgic for back when I used to smoke.  I guess it'll just take time; like everything else. Pretty much the whole I get out of my experience of stopping smoking is once your there it will be rough every once and a while no matter how long it has been.  Don't give in, it just isn't worth it.

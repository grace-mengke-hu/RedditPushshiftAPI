All my friends smoke to this day, and I seem to be the only one who is adamant about quitting. I really do want to quit. I've been (TRYING TO) wean myself off buying packs, (when I don't buy packs) only smoking about 3-5 cigarettes a day. But when I don't have any cigarettes, I am almost desperate for one and can't think about anything else. Tips to help me quit? I don't want to die of lung cancer. I also want to stop spending a good chunk of my paycheck just on cigarettes. All ex-smokers, please give me your wise words.

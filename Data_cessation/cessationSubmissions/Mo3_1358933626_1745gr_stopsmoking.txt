The smokers at my company laughed at me - they still haven't understood.

Yes, this might be my 8th or 9th shot at quitting smoking. Yes, you can laugh all you want and tell me I might "not have the willpower for it". 

What these guys still haven't really understood is that I am ACTUALLY trying to quit while they sit around, dream about quitting and kill themselves. 

Everyone fails, and there is no shame in doing so. But only a fool would accept that failure and continue to smoke. You failed and relapsed? Fine. Doesn't matter. Had to happen. Try again.

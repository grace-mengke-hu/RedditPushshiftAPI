does one puff count to a reset?

So i was at a bar with my friends, and one of them says "check out this awesome oxygen hookah! It's so great!" I asked him if there was tobacco in it, and he said no.

He must be an idiot, because i took one puff and it definitely had tobacco in it. I walked away in disgust. 

Today I dont have any cravings or anything. Should i reset my counter? My friend is kinda stupid.

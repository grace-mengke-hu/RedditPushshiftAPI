The dreaded relapse and then not wanting to look at this sub out of guilt

So I slipped at nearly 3 months after a night with friends and tequila- honestly I was around a load of smokers and my resolve weakened. I did another week and a half then yesterday I was so incredibly stressed that I had 4 last night and then 2 this evening.
God I feel like shit. 
Going to reset my app because I don’t want to be a smoker again. Not only do I love the way my skin and teeth feel (well not right now sadly), but how much more time I had in the day.
I have been avoiding this sub because I’m so disappointed in myself and feel that all the encouragement and congratulations I’ve had on my previous posts have been for nothing.
So I’m sorry, I’m back and here’s to day one again tomorrow

This is my 100th+ time quitting, is this the one?

I am next to 49 years old. I started smoking at 15. I quit my pack-a-day at 31. Since then, I have been smoking a few, a pack, what have you, at every opportunity I was being given (alcohol, pot, smoking GF, etc.) and swore to quit after each occasion, and never respected my self-promise.

What's new today? I don't know but I feel different. I want to change my way of life. I want to live a healthier, happier, lovelier self. Cigarette use is at the center of this unhealthy life of mine. 

The motivation is new: I don't aim for quitting cigarette, I aim to change my lifestyle. In some sense, it's harder to change oneself. In another sense, I have not been successful at all at quitting cigarettes. So I'm quitting quitting, and aim for something I really want. It will not be easy, no sir. Let it begin! Day 5.

Back to day 1...

Sucks to crack and start smoking again. So back here to leach from motivation of others and try and conquer the fear i have of quitting smoking. Ive never been a heavy smoker so cant really understand the hunger to smoke so bad. Ill do it this time. Last cig just smoked. Back to the start we go.

Shiiiiiit I relapse today :'(

It's been 12 days without smoking and relapse today. 

Let me explain : 

There is a new bar at town with like 200 kinds of diffenrent beer, i drank like 6 of it ( +- 9% alchool in it ) so I was pretty drunk. I didn't even want to smoke it just a habit I have here at my dad's house.

The worst is that I read Allen Carr's book and I watch the seminar. But today like a fucking asshole, I smoke a butt. 

I don't want a cigarette during the day but there was some tobacco left in my dressing room and I smoke it :'( 

I'm really don't proud of myself I don't know WHY I've smoke this cigarette? -_- 

What's your opinion ? 
Is this bad, am I going to be a smoker again ? 

Just tell me why I relapse is it common even with the Allen Carr's Method ? 

Or Have I to rewatch it again ?

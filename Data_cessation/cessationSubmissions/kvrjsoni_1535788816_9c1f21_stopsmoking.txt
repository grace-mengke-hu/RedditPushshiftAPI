Broke my 12 days no smoking streak

I just wanna know are there any occasional smokers out there? And does occasionally smoking even work or one just eventually falls back into the daily habit? I went to this club and everyone was smoking dancing, I felt like having one, struggled for a while then concluded that I don't go to clubs that often then why shouldn't I have a good time and enjoy occasional smokes.

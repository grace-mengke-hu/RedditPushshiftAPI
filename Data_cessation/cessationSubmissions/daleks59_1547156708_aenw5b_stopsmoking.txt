I’m doing this!

I’ve been a smoker for over 10 years. For a long time this was part of my identity, part of the scene. I thought it made me look cool or edgy, that it helped with my anxiety. But recently I’ve noticed smoking excludes me. My health is suffering, I’m embarrassed by smoking, afraid of smelling of smoke or having smokers breath. I’ve watched my mother smoke and continue to smoke as her health deteriorates, the same with my father. For a long time I saw myself following this path. I couldn’t see a way out or imagine a life without cigarettes. 
I’m 9 days free of the monster. This is longest I have ever been smoke free. 

Big shout out to you all, I’ve been lurking here for a long time, watching all your success inspired me to finally try and shake this beast. 
 We can do this!

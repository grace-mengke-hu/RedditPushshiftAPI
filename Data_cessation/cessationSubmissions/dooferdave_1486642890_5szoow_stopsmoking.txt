1000 Days! I am done after 28 years of smoking

Me, my family and everyone that knows me never thought they would see me quit. Now it has been almost 3 years. So unbelievable.

Good luck out there everyone. Thanks for reading.

P.S. I quit with a vape that lasted two months. Been cold turkey since. Do what works for you just dont trade one habit for another.

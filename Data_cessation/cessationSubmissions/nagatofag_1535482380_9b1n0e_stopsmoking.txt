Afraid of tomorrow's cravings

I started to smoke 10 years ago, when I was 17.
Tried to quit several times. Two years ago I quit for 7 months, cold turkey. Then, one autumn evening in a bar, I thought that, since I don't have any cravings now, one cigarette won't make an addict from me — idiot.

Every morning, around 11, I come to an office, make myself a cup of coffee and go smoke one cigarette. I feel dizzy afterwards, feel nausea, but next 5-6 cigarettes during the day are better: one after lunch, then another one or two, another after dinner, and the last one before I leave — because my wife hates when I smoke, so I smoke only at the office.
Every evening I hate myself for letting this to continue. I tell myself that I quit tomorrow. And then morning comes, and I am in the office, and another day of smoking doesn't seem like a bad idea.

Today I found this sub, bought the Smoke Free, and set today as the quit day. I feel confident now, but who knows what would I feel tomorrow?

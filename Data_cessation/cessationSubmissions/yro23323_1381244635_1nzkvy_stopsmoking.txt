One year in the bag!

I have been waiting to write this post for some time now.  I have more to say, but I am running out the door to work.  Just remember to take your recovery day by day and as patiently as you can.

**EDIT** I'm not sure why my counter is a day off and I've never noticed, but my counter on my phone says a year...I'm going off the one on my phone.

How hard is it to quit vaping?

I've smoked for 7 years now, with the last three years being a pack a day, sometimes more. I quit on Monday, after buying a vape on Sunday to help with the transition. I am starting out with 6mg of nicotine in the e-liquid and plan on gradually transitioning that down to 0mg before stopping vaping entirely.

I am wondering, will this be just as hard to quit as smoking, or will it be easier? I was thinking it will end up being easier because I can gradually lower the amount of nicotine I take in while keeping up with the habit of inhaling something. But to me, the act of inhaling smoke was always what I ended up craving more than the nicotine anyways. 

Am I just setting myself up for having to go through the same tough process again in the future? Or will this actually make things easier? It seems to have made some cravings a lot easier to deal with, at least the ones that cropped up when I was stressed out. But if it's just gonna be another horribly hard habit to kick, I think I'll just stop with the vape and go full cold turkey.

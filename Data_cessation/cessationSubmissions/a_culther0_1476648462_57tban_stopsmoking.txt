I switched to an ecigarette a couple of years ago

I've been wanting to quit nicotine for a long time.  I hate smoking and hate the agitation from withdrawal.  So as an intermediate step I moved to an ecigarette.  For regular use it has some of the advantages of not smoking.. cheaper to use week over week.. no smell.. and if your having an intense craving you can sneak into the bathroom with no one the wiser.  However this is the problem.  Now when I'm alone I find myself using it all the time.  Anyone else find them stuck on nicotine replacement therapy and got over it?

I've got one cigarette left in my pack and I'm not buying anymore.

I was at my seven y/o daughter's soccer practice just now and out of nowhere  she started feeling ill. So, we decided to leave practice early. She was pale and weak so I picked her up and carried her ~150 yards back to the car. By the time I got her to the car, my chest had tightened up and I was struggling to breathe. I felt like I was going to die. I have made the decision. I've got one cigarette left and I'm not buying anymore. I'm done. Wish me luck.

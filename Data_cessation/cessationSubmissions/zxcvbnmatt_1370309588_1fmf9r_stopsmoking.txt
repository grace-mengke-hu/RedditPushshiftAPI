I was surprised at the rate of my addiction, it was sudden.

I started smoking a year ago, and it was always recreational, but late last year it became heavy (1-2) packs a week. It was a smoke break at work, a walk outside, then eventually every event that I went outside I would have a cigarette in my hand(1 pack a day). 

My eating disorders were heavier because of smoking, too, and I felt like a sick person for about six months. With everything from heroin to stealing to gluttony, the addictions followed me everywhere. I have never been to rehab, but I wish I would have at this point.

It has been 24 hours since my ecig ran out, and 48 hours since I finished my menthol cancer sticks. Damn these black hole death traps! ruin my life and kill me? What a fucking waste of life.

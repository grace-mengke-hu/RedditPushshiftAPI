a thank you to my understanding partner

I've smoked on and off for about 10 years. I am a very social person and smoking, I always argued, was just social for me. I don't smoke at home or at work. When I am sober I don't even think about ciagrettes... the second I go the bar and have a drink I immediately start thinking about a cigarette.

My boyfriend of 6 years kindly sat me down and talked to me about quitting. he's always hated me smoking and generally just dealt with it when we were out with friends... but we've been making a lot of positive changes in our lives lately and he felt like this was an important one for me... and how can I argue? He's right, it is.

So I did it, I quit on December 15th, 2014 and I made it 3.5 months without a cigarette before I crashed and burned. Something switched in my brain and I collapsed. Luckily for me my boyfriend has been very supportive. He undestands that it's hard- he understands that he DOESN'T understand and he doesn't "mom" me about it. I've promised him that I'll always be honest and not hide my smoking if he promises to not yell at me when I stumble.

I know that the problem is that I no longer want to quit- even though I LOVED when I didn't smoke for those months. 

So a super big thank you to my awesome partner who is there for me when I win and there for me when I lose. Nothing has been more important than that. 

And I will quit. It's a new day.

It’s been 11 months with drinking or smoking.

I only drink socially and when I do I just have exactly one Michelob ultra and then switch to club soda. I make sure I don’t feel the alcohol. I’ve been thinking about drinking a cocktail or two when I go out with friends and dipping my toes in the water with a liquor again. I’m honestly scared shitless of getting drunk. I’m scared I’ll lose control and  maybe have a cig. I’ve been avoiding liquor for the last 11 months now and I think it’s time for a change soon. I used to drink a ton in college but would always heavily smoke when drinking. I kind of associate drinking and smoking with each other. I want to start drinking liquor socially again. I just have too much fear of losing control and smoking. Anyone here have any thoughts about drinking and being a non smoker? 

Ps since I’ve quit smoking 11 months ago I’ve really pulled a 360 in my lifestyle. Ive lost over 50ibs with diet and exercise. Got a new job and great girlfriend. Ive leaned how to control my anxiety and nerves without smoking. Things are looking up in life :)

3 months 3days now i'm coughing

For the past week I have a dry cough and I probably cough like 5 times a day. I have a a dry throat and very very slight shortness of breath. Is this normal? I can't find to much about it on old threads or google so any advice or reading links or reassurance would be nice 

thanks

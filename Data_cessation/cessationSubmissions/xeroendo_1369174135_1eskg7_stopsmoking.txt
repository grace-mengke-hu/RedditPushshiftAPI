Having surgery in 8 days and need to quit.

I quit smoking yesterday, I'm on a liquid diet, and can't drink alcohol either. I'm going INSANE! Usually I have one to cancel out the cravings of the other. I'm hoping to quit completely and not start back up after the surgery but right now I'm just going crazy.

Edit: Oh, and I just got braces so I can't chew gum.

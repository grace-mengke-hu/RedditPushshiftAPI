Detoxing as though it's hard drugs...

Ok guys. I've tried every method to quit and relapsed every time. I've smoked 20 a day for 20 years and feel awful. I hate smoking I need to quit and I am going to.

In my life I have been a drug addict twice. Once meth and once coke. The only way i quit was by taking to my bed and emerging days later detoxed from the chemicals. This is my plan. I have 2 weeks off work after next week. I'm going to make sure I have plenty of food and drink. No cigarettes and destroy my cash cards so I have no way of buying any. Then sweat it out. I know from past experience if I can make it through two days I'll be ok. I'm determined to do it.

Screwed up after 126 days

I'm going through a separation with my husband, i have been very stressed. It's "helping" and i know i have to stop. I don't even feel that bad about it right no. I need something, some crutch. I feel like i've kinda taken on the world and if this one thing is my weakness right now. Its ok. I know I can stop again, maybe its not forever, maybe it is. I'll be back guys. Stay strong.

Need a little support (anger related)

Hi guys.
Ignore my badge, it is not accurate. I actually have not smoked cigarettes in months. My issue is with smokeless tobacco. I originally started using American chew, then to cigarettes, back to chew, then to Swedish snus for about a year and a half. I finally decided to call it quits with nicotine (for the 10342342342 time) and I am dealing with some fairly severe rage 'fits' if you will. I am having a very hard time controlling my anger, and it's so bad I wouldn't even call it anger, just pure rage. I bought some herbal pouches (no tobacco, no nicotine, made from mint and licorice root) to help my oral fixation, which is working great. The lack of nicotine is really setting me off though, and I could use some words of wisdom or advice from someone who has dealt with a similar situation.

Thanks guys

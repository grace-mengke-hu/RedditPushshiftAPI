I've tried e-Smoking (vaping) in the past, only to restart analog smoking.

And today I read....

>The FDA has been investigating whether or not there are carcinogens present in e-cigs, and has warned of safety risks since 2009.

>Studies of the nicotine solution and resulting vapor showed trace amounts of carcinogens typically found in tobacco smoke. Another study revealed "vaping" for just 5 minutes made breathing more difficult; chemicals in the nicotine can cause increased asthma risk and respiratory inflammation. Worse, tests of nicotine refills showed some toxicity to human cells, and due to contamination by heating, some vapor contained small metal particles.

Um... metal particles???? Another reason for me not to re-consider cheating the system by getting those e-cigs again.

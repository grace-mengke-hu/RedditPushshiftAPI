Day 5: the longest I’ve made it

Just thinking out loud: 

I’ve been smoking half a pack a day for five years. I quit because I am generally a very nervous person and I was constantly worried about getting a lung cancer every cigarette I smoked. Laughably, I continued to kill myself while fully aware that I was doing so every cig I smoked. I’ve tried to quit cigs countless times - none lasted more than a week. As far as I can remember, it’s the longest I’ve made it without smoking. The first three days were really hard, but now I don’t really crave it that much. The only trigger is when I run into a group of people smoking on the street - i guess it “normalizes” smoking in my head since so many people are doing it. But I’m teaching myself to PITY them instead of envying them, for cigs absolutely do nothing for you and merely keep you addicted. I quit because I hated being a smoker, and this time will be different because I am using a lot of outside sources (websites, reddit, book, app, etc) and not forgetting to remind myself couple times a day what a difference i am making for the better in my lifestyle!

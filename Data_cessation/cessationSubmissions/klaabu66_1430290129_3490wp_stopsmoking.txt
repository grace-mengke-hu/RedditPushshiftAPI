Decided to completely quit today after reading your incredible subreddit.

Hello everyone. I sort of decided to quit in february after my 37 year old cousin passed away. But it has been extremely difficult, i haven't purchased a pack for ages and i don't smoke on my days off, but when i'm at work, where most people smoke i just can't control the urge and ask colleagues for smokes. I haven't had any today and thanks to randomly finding this subreddit and reading a lot here i have decided to quit for good. Last summer i lost my mother, at a relatively young age of 51. She lived quite unhealthily - smoked a lot and drank, mostly due to my fathers heavy alcohol use(he's 61). Seeing all these people die around me, made me realize how fragile a human being really is.
So i'm hoping for some support and good words from you guys and maybe some additional advice on how to control the urge. Thanks

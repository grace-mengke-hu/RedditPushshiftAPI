Question about weird taste or feeling in throat?

Hey guys, 18 days in the quit for me! Just had a question.  I've started to notice a weird sensation in my throat lately since quitting. It's almost like there's stomach acid at the bottom of my throat or if I burp, I might taste a little throw up or something.  Almost like a bad taste at the bottom of my throat? Don't ask me how that even works lol! Just curious if any of you quitters have experienced bad/weird tastes in mouth/throat after quitting. Thanks for your input and anecdotes!

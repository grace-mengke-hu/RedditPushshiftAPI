I want to quit, need some tips please..

Hey everyone I have lurked here for awhile and had some questions. What I'm really worried about is when I'm with friends and at work.

With friends we always have our smoking breaks and I feel I would be pressured to smoke when I'm near them, any suggestions?

Same with at work, there is nothing I look forward to then sneaking off and having a smoke break. I feel like I smoke so much at work cause smokers get as many breaks as they petty much want. 

Would really love to know how you guys have dealt with this when you quit. Thank you.

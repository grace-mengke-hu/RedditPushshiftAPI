Day 2 and I'm feeling good. Beer and the nicotine monster.

I've been around everyone at work who smokes and it isn't bothering me. I'm so happy to have found my "key" and be on my way. Today I had a beer when I got home from work while mellowing out. Beer can be a trigger for me, but beer is too goddamn good to give up. I'm not going to avoid any of my triggers, but especially beer. I don't even drink that much, I just enjoy good micro brews every now and I again and I'm not going to let smoking ruin that for me.

Today I was entertaining myself at work by imagining my nicotine monster as an actual monster. This frail little, black, crusty, dusty fuckhead with hypno-toad eyes...then I curb stomp the bejesus out of him. Yes, I'm having mood swings.

Thanks again reddit! Probably won't be on this weekend, but I'll chat again on monday!

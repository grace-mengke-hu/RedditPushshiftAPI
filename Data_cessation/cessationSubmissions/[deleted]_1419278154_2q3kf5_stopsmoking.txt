A gift to my family

I am giving myself the gift (haha) of quitting for Xmas. I have been hiding my habit from my husband for months and months, as he quit back in May. I am DONE wasting money and sneaking around and always feeling guilty. I am DONE threatening my daughter's health with second hand smoke. I am DONE being a slave to those white tubes of death. 

On day 4 (sort of, as I bummed one from my roommate yesterday) and I have a HUGE cold sore and a strong desire to cry/scream/quit my job and run for the hills. I WILL MAKE IT. 

Anybody else getting a jump on NYE and quitting now?

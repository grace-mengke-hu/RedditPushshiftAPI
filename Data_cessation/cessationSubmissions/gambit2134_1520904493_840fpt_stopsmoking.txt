Day 17. Do I smell different?

Pretty new to the sub, but today is 17 days of being smoke free. After trying to quit cold turkey and attempting the patch, the pill worked for me. It might serve me as a crutch but it helped and I feel great. Even in moments of stress, my first thought is no longer “I need a cigarette!” 

But yesterday, and again today, my husband stated that I smell different. I work in construction so sometimes I do get home with a sweaty funk. But I’m the kind of person that likes to be clean, I wear expensive colognes and love getting compliments on my scent. 

So hearing that I smell different (without cologne) threw me off. Is this a thing that happens? Without the cigarette, do I now smell different? His theory is that the medicine is making me smell different.

He says it’s not a bad smell, I don’t stink, it’s just different. So it catches him off guard. 

But I’m confused and wanna know if anyone else has had this happen after they quit.

P.S. he still smokes, I’m not pushing for him to quit, but maybe leading by example will help encourage him.

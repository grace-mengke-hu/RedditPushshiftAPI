Any advice on "conditional addiction"?

I'm in my early 20s and I have what I call a "conditional addiction" or the dreaded "social smoker". When I am out with friends, especially drinking, I get anxious and want to smoke. I might have social anxiety, or I get bored and it gives me something to do. The sad thing is if I stay home for a week, two weeks, etc. I won't even think about a cigarette not even once. I think this happened through teenage association of going out/having fun with smoking. My initial thought was, If I want to quit all I have to do is not go out. However that is obviously ridiculous, so any words of advice?

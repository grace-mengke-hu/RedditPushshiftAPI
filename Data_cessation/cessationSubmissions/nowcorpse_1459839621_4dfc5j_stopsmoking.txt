6 months done. Healthier and happier than ever before

Addiction history: 13 years of smoking 25 cigarettes a day on average. 35+ if drinking or when "stressed".

Why did I quit?: Just like that. Sick and tired of being a smoker and stinking and defending my "right to smoke" and never having even made a single attempt to quit or curb. Plus I was a couch potato with neither energy nor inclination to be conscious about my own health and well-being

What helped?: This sub. Allen Carr. Smoke Free App.

How is life now?: Infinitely better. No cravings, no envy of smokers (pity actually), no missing of "those" days, no constant coughing, no stinking clothes/car. Healthier due to more energy, took up running immediately after quitting, finished two 10k races so far, training for a half marathon, bicycle commuting to office, less fighting with spouse, counselled/convinced 4 more friends to quit, saving a ton of money.

Advice to people who want to quit: The best day to quit smoking was a decade ago. The next best day is TODAY. Go cold turkey. You won't regret it. Nicotine is a weak-ass drug, it's addiction is short-lived. Takes a day or two of physical effort, and a few weeks of mental strength. You will be free. Don't think. Just jump with both your feet into the quit wagon. We are all waiting for you.

I'll answer any questions any beginners may have (I'm no expert, but I'm six months clean and can bring in a perspective you may be lacking at the moment).

So I fell off the wagon...

Did so well for a month and a half. Made the mistake of going on a road trip without my S/O and started up again. Been smoking again now for about 5 months. Mostly at work and when I can 'go to the store'. I'm afraid of telling my S/O for fear of the disappointment. She is a former smoker also so I know she would be understanding, it's just that she still thinks I've quit. The topic is never brought up so haven't lied about it just keeping it from her. I have to quit. My kids need me. I have to do it for them and the rest of my family. Mostly my piece of mind. I hate keeping this little secret from my S/O and can't do it anymore. Sorry for the rant, I need to try to keep myself accountable. I WILL be successful this time. Good luck to everyone.

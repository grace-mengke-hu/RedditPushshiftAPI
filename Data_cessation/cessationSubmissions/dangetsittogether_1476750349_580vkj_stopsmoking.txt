Getting through the first Monday

Sorry I'm going to make a short list tonight. Ive embedded up with a weird sickness where I'm really dizzy unless I lay down, idk what its about, the doc says it's got nothing to do with smoking. Just some kind of head balance thing.

At the save time I can't help but wonder, would I be sick at all right now if I never smoked? I know that smoking lists your immune system so by quitting I'm reducing the probability of getting sick like this again.


Anyway, when you're sick it's easy to not smoke. So I made it through day 3 famously!

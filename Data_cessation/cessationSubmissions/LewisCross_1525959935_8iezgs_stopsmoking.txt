Why I Hate Smoking.

Even though I was a smoker, I still hated it.  I think I "enjoyed" it for maybe 1 year out of the 15 I did it. 

The main reason I hate it is because tobacco, and peoples' decision to use it, deprived me of a lot of family members.

--Paternal grandfather.  Dead of emphysema at 57.  I never met him.  He was dead before my parents married. 

--Maternal grandfather. Dead of aortic aneurysm at 45.  I never met him.  He died when my mom was 13.  

I grew up without grandfathers because they made the decision to smoke.   

--My mother's brother.  Didn't kill him, but he suffered mightily.  Consider:

age 45:  first heart attack.  

age 60: second heart attack.  Triple bypass.  

age 62:  gets  circulatory disorder and bad diabetes.  has 3 toes amputated. 

age 65:  Precancerous cells found in throat.  Has to have vocal chords scraped.   

age 65:  Finally quits his 50-year addiction.   He is still living.  But takes a multitude of drugs to manage the conditions in his deteriorating body, accelerated and exacerbated by smoking.  He's lucky he's still alive at age 72.   Damn lucky.  All that smoking should have killed him.  

Maternal aunt:  Bladder and kidney cancer.  Eventually kills her at age 70.

Don't let this happen to you.  Or your kids.  Or your kids' kids.

Don't.  Just don't.

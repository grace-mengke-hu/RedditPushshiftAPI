Day 2: I don’t even want to be around myself right now.

My word am I irritable!! 

I have a  low nicotine vape for help during the worst bits,  so I’m no going completely cold turkey. I plan to phase that to zero nicotine and then get rid over the next month or so. I know I should probably go completely cold turkey but I keep failing at that, the vape has helped me to actually get to two days without a real fag so I think that’s good.

A month and a half without nicotine and I hardly think about smoking except to congratulate myself for making it this far

I don't want to get complacent or anything, but I do find it surprising how easy it feels now. I can honestly say I don't miss it anymore, if anything because my smoking habits had become so over the top that I was grossing myself out.

Right now I have a horrible throat infection and I know for a fact that If I hadn't quit, I would be smoking at least a pack of menthols a day instead of two packs of regulars, thinking that was taking care of myself by doing so.

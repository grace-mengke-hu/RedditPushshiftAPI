More strong physical cravings after 11 days?

I quit smoking for two years, and I've only been smoking again for 6 months or so, and not very much (1/4 - 1/2 pack a day) but I've been struggling with quitting. 
I quit 12 days ago and have been through A LOT. I've sat up with a crying toddler all night with an ear infection, taken said toddler to the ER and sat with her for hours, went out, drank, had sex, had someone hand me a lit cigarette, etc... and it's been a struggle of course, but for SOME reason I now have that awful warm feeling in the back of my throat that went away after the first few days, the feeling that only goes away with a deep draw of smoke. It's been a day and a half now and this craving is killing me. Why now? I've heard 3 days, 3 weeks, but never 11-12 days. I realize everyone is different, but this is driving me nuts. I've been drinking cold water and eating textured foods to try to get that feeling to go away, and it's not.

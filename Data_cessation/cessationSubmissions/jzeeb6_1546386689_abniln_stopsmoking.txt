Day 1: Easier than expected.

Hey guys. I decided as my New Years resolution, I’d stop smoking. And since 4:00 am this morning, I haven’t taken a puff. Right now, it’s hard, I’m getting cravings, so I decided to share this with you. 


I’ll try to keep you guys updated, my personal cheerleaders &lt;3.

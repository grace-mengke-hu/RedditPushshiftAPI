It can’t be this hard

I’m trapped in a cycle of self torture. Cigarettes repulse me, and yet something keeps me stuck. It’s become somewhat of a daily routine convincing myself that the next day will be free of cigarettes, and yet crawling back every time. I need to make a firm choice between the life I want, and the one I don’t. 

I’ve quit a couple of times in the past two years, the longest being a few months. I felt SO good, and I want that feeling of ease and empowerment back. 

Fellow friends, if you’ve been on a similar journey, I’d love to hear what worked for you. 
Please continue on your path with conviction if you’re already quit, because it is the only path to freedom. The alternative sucks ass (but you know this)

32 hours. My addiction is crying. Let it.

It has taken me months to get past 24 hours. It took me a text from my daughter to get my head on right. She is lifting weights like a pro, like I did, before I started smoking again. Enough, damn it.

My addiction is crying. Poor thing. Let it cry. I am just fine.

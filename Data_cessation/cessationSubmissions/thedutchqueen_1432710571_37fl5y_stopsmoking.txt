Just extinguished my final cigarette ever.

At work, finished reading Allen Carr's EasyWay to Stop Smoking for the second time. 

I quit on New Years with my (now ex) boyfriend, made it almost 3 months and it felt wonderful to be free for once. Then i suffered a terrible breakup and decided that i no longer gave a fuck about my health. Smoked one on my 21st birthday (March 11) and it never tasted better. I quickly spiraled into a full blown addiction once again. Realized how much i hate smoking boges. Quit on a whim, AGAIN, lasted 2 weeks and then fell into the trap of "just one puff." Well at least I know for a fact, that the "just one" mindframe never works. 


Anyway I'm over it. I'm just terribly scared of the stress and pain that will inevitably follow, and the hardest part about quitting for me is to cope without hurting myself in some way. I used to self-harm and sadly used smoking as a justification because 
"it's better than cutting." This is not how i want to live my life. I want to be able to experience the lows without my self-destructive thinking. I want to heal from this break up without resorting to some other form of torture. Maybe I'm going about this the wrong way. Idk. I thought that if i posted on this sub now, it could add momentum to my progress. Cheers, Reddit, i hope one day I could have as many years free as some of you.

Finally quitting

I promised my girlfriend I would quit smoking by the 4th of July 2017... that didn’t happen unfortunately, and I’ve avoiding setting a new date with her for fear of breaking another promise. So I’m hoping that having a community of people who can help support me will help me to finally quit and surprise her! Please wish me luck as I just finished what will hopefully be my final cigarette of my life!

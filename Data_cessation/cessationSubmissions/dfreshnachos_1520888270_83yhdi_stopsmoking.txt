I finally have committed myself.

Been a lurker for awhile now. I’ve been battling this cigarette addiction for 25 plus years and have tried to quit for a few years now. Six months is the longest I’ve gone. Today I slapped the patch on again and I’m dedicating myself to finally just STOP the MADNESS. I do great on the patch then can step down quickly. This time I have a game plan when I come off the 7mg patch. With this community and seeing all the success and encouragement I can do this. Thank you all and together we can stay quit!!!

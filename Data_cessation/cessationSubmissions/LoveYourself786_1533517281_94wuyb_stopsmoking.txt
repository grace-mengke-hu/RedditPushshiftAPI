My story so far.

**Day 0** (sorry for the tense jumps)  
  I told myself if I’m going to live, I may as well live healthy and in control. And, I told myself I’m doing it only for myself. This time I have told no one. I want to feel better for me. I love myself, and I deserve all the blessings I have. I am calm. I’ll turn this addiction off like a switch.

I always feel tired, on autopilot, unhappy, worried, stressed, anxious and sick. I feel depressed that I have lost control over myself. I felt even worse when I had to stay by myself and not socialize.  
  I was afraid someone else would smell it.  
  I was afraid they’d judge me.  
  I was afraid of sickness.  
  I was afraid for my future.  
  I was always afraid.  
  There is a lot to be said about someone who cannot control their addiction, especially when it kills. I feel that I do not love myself. Why? I have convinced myself that this is helping because it offered me something to look forward to. But, are these challenges not a normal part of life? I deserve to enjoy my life, even the challenges!  
  I was always too *occupied* to realize there was much more in life. There are better ways to attain my goals, one that doesn’t involve addiction. I’ll choose those, because I am worth it. I am worth living a healthy life and a life that I can navigate through. When someone falls in love with me, I deserve to be with them for as long as possible. I deserve to be loved. I deserve to enjoy each passing day in control, with my loved one. They deserve to not lose me. They deserve to be loved as well. They deserve to be with someone in control. I can’t believe I’ve left people just so I could satisfy my addiction. I’m glad I learned that some people will leave me though. It’s an eye-opener. That’s why I have to do this for me, even though a part of me knows there’s more to it. To make up for it, I’ll tell no one. Time to fulfill some promises I made myself.

**Day 1-3.**  
 I woke up and reassured myself of my future.  I took it very easy at work. I got work done but sometimes I had to pretend I was working when the cravings hit. I got really interested in cravings. I read that when someone becomes aware of addiction, it becomes harder to quit. However, when they become really aware of it, the exact opposite can happen. Right now, I don’t know what to think. It’s not fun. I feel tired. However, I’m glad that the people around me aren’t pushing me to do more. They’re great people. I work at a very nice place. I love the work I do. I love that all the work I’ve put in is showing some result. I went home and cooked a proper meal for the first time in so long. I even had a proper lunch. I will do this from now on. I’m saving lots of money. Life is fucking great right now. I can breathe! I’m eating so well. I’m talking to people more. I love myself.

**Day 4-7.**

I regularly check the “quit smoking timelines” available online. It’s amazing what my body will do for me, despite all the damage I’ve done to it. I’m sorry. I’ll make it up with my new diet. I’ll fight the cravings, eat all the right food and exercise for my body and mind. The only body and mind I’ll ever have. I’ve become very in tuned with cravings. When I have a craving, I immediately leave my workplace/home and go for a walk. I pay attention to what I’m feeling. Actually, I might like this a little too much. At first, I feel hurt – not irritation. I feel like I’m missing something. I fight it. Then, when it’s over, I feel great. I feel like I’ve won. But, weird as it sounds, I’m excited for the next one. I guess I really like to win. I guess I must really like myself now. I love that.  


I treated myself with a caffeinated beverage on Day 5. I earned it by walking to the restaurant.  
  

**Day 7-14**

I can’t wait for the one-month mark. Apparently, I’ll be able to run further. The last time I ran it was a disaster. Maybe I’ll hit up some trails. I don’t know what I’ll do, but there are so many possibilities that I can really explore now. That, alone, feels awesome! Yes, I regularly check the quit smoking timelines.  
 

I have to watch out for my caffeine intake now. I’m getting incredibly wired on this stuff these days. But, it’s also an addiction, so I have to get rid of it. Some people think I’m weird for dropping caffeine. For the few days that I was off of it I was sleeping regularly, I felt energetic up until the last hour or two of the day, and I felt *so damn* comfortable. It’s how comfortable I was that gets me. I don’t feel as comfortable since I’ve started taking caffeine again (90-180 mg). I don’t feel as in control either. I’ll drop it again. I love myself enough to.

It has to happen. Today it has

So last night, I decided to have my last cigarette at 11pm. Not because feel that I am ready to quit just yet, but I definitely NEED to. I remember once when I could ride a bike or run, or something that involved taking my health seriously.
New years morning I came home a little buzzed and exhausted and after smoking a few too many cigarettes I went to my bathroom to brush my teeth and hacked up some more of that lovely brown stuff.
  
I cant do it to myself anymore, how on earth have I managed to sit here for such a long time and imagine that coughing up phlegm is actually a normal thing to do in my life as a smoker. I think that it will get much worse as my body starts to repair itself - but i feel it will be much better in the long run.
  
I just need to find a lot of distractions to keep myself away from all of them!

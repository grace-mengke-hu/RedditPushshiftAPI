Reminder: You are NOT safe after 1 year

About a week ago, I had a bad week and was getting frustrated about not being able to find a job as well as some other petty things that don't matter. I saw my brother having a cigarette in the garage and I sat down by him. After 10 minutes of thinking, I asked him for one. I held onto it and just looked at it for a long time, and then I finally lit it and threw 400 days out the window. Just like that I'm back to day 0. No matter how awful things are or how frustrated you are, there is ABSOLUTELY NO SUCH THING as just one more. You're either done smoking forever or you're an addict. After about a week and a couple of packs smoked, I'm ready for round 2. Wish me luck!

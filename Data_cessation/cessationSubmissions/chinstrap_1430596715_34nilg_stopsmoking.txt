Day 1 going OK so far

I've been up since 9 AM. Finished pack of cigs about 5 AM, when I was up for a while, and went back to bed. I tried to do this last weekend but couldn't go through with it....got up, threw out all ashtrays and lighters. Found a pack with 2 cigarettes left in it in the car - threw it out. I've had 3 nicotine lozenges so far today; I'm trying to only take one if I feel like I am going insane.

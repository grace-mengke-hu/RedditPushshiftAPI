Day 3, Mornings are getting easier, but still I have to slap my wrists sometimes.

I have been clean 3 days, and I am getting used to being free of smoking. I hope soon it will be just a thing I used to do an nothing more. Mornings were hard, and probably will still be for a while. I used to have this morning routine, coffee, roll a cig. Read the papers. Coffee, roll a cig. I am replacing the smoke with a healthy breakfast (muesli, yoghurt, bread and cheese) and trying to put the pangs aside. Still, like whiffs of smoke the thought of 'just a puff' sometime creeps into my mind. No! Not even once! Do something else.

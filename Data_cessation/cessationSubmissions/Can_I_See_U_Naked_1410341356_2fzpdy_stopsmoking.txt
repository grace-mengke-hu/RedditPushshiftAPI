Well, I have decided it is is time, my friends. It is time to rid nicotine from my life.

It's been a good 6 years now, and I'm ready to have an even better rest of my life. I am prepared. I am going to keep the last few smokes in this pack, to ensure that I am able to have self control. Here's to quitting, and good luck to myself and the rest of you fine folks.

Worst chest cold ever....

So I currently have the worst chest cold EVER, and because of it I haven't smoked since last Wednesday.  Just badged up! I am done for good!  I never want to experience another bronchial episode like this again.  Long time lurker, finally a badger.  Wheezing like a mofo.

For those that want to know, i have smoked regularly for the past 10 years, with the last two being the worst.  One week a go I was smoking around 15 a day (more when I was drinking), might not be a lot to some, but sure felt like a lot to me.

Quit yesterday, need to vent about my boss

So, yesterday I went from being a contract employee to a direct employee at my work. While discussing benefits with my coworkers, they revealed to me that the health insurance was changing soon, and that it would cost $200/month if you're a smoker. Quickly doing some math, that would mean that the cost for me to smoke every year would triple, and f**k that. I spiked my nearly full pack of smokes in the trash.

So today I come into work, and my boss, who quit smoking 3 years ago, is being a total dick about it. He told me there's a smoking cessation class I could take for 8 weeks to get past the smoking fees. When I said "I'm just not sure what to do with my hands now!" He said, "Just pay the $200 a month and go smoke dude."

I work in aviation, so everyone can be kinda tough. You really need thick skin to get by as a mechanic in any field, really, so that's not really what's pissing me off. What makes me mad is that he used to smoke. Like does he not understand that it's a hard thing to do? How many people told him to just forget about quitting and smoke the rest of his life? 

I just needed to vent. Congrats to everyone here though!

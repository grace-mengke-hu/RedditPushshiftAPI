Quitting Again

Finally received my e-cig from victory (thanks r/freebies) I really enjoy it despite some redditors receiving duds.. I smoked my 'last' cigarette last night at around 7:00, but broke down and had one at the queers show.

Woke up feeling pretty good, drove to work and smoked my e-cig and so far no cravings, no need to kill - just feels like any other day!

My goal is eventually to nix the e-cig, but for the time being it will help.

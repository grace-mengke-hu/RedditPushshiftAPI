I have to Quit, I need help.

Hi Everyone,

I am 39 years old male from Australia and have been smoking for about 23 years. I have tried to quit numerous times but it has never stuck. I am 150kg (330lbs) and am on medication for high blood pressure. 

I have come here to seek out advice from those that have quit. I smoke an average of 20-25 cigarettes a day, and i know i need to quit for my health.

I find that i tend to smoke at work for the 5-10min break i get because i can smoke whenever i want. During my 30mins lunch break i smoke around 4 cigarettes.

I don't know what to do, i am addicted i will admit it. i need help.

Any advice?

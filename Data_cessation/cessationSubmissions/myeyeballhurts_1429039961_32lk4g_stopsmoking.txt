Im at 2 weeks, physical symptoms are still bothering me, how much longer should this last?

It kinda comes and goes in spurts, but I just feel so blah, head ache, nausea, fatigue. This could be exacerbated by the fact I quit diet pop the same day. I have been hitting the gym, drinking GALLONS of water and eating better. How long did it take everyone to start to feel physically better?

stumble and keep going!

Well, I'm not going to let this get me down. I was drinking last night and smoked. Long story short, I cannot drink until I have quit for awhile. I refuse to let this get me down! I am absolutely going to quit. I requested a new badge and everything. I still have that book that everyone suggested and I'm going to read it. I really mean it that I will quit. I feel capable and this one slip up is not the entirety of this experience.

16 days

I haven't been on here for a few days, I haven't even considered how long it's been since the big quit but I'm really surprised it's been over 2 weeks already! I haven't even been using the vape much either, only once when I felt stressed about another job interview a few days ago. Anyway, it's such a great feeling. I can't wait to hit the 21 day mark! Good luck to everyone else out there :)

Two years... wow, how times flies.

(edit: *time, not 'times' lol)

Yesterday marked two years since I decided I was done with smoking. I came in here, I posted my various ramblings from day one until my one year post which summed up all of them.

[Here is my one year post, with links to all the previous posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/w5m16/one_year_tonight_some_thoughts_and_reflections/)

Since then, my car was destroyed by a student driver (it was parked) and I decided to not get a new car and bought a bike and now I bike about 150 miles per week, 100 of those just for work, the other on rides on the weekend. I also did the [couch to 5k program](/r/c25k/). I have traveled all over the west coast, I have hiked Yosemite falls twice, the grand canyon and multiple other parks.  

I am in the planning stages of thru-hiking the [Pacific Crest Trail](/r/PacificCrestTrail/) in 2014 and already have a lot of my gear. (note: The 'PCT class of 2014' group on Facebook is awesome).

I also quit drinking, which is another story. I also have started a new company, and would say that I am very happy with who and what I am now.

Many people who know me now think it is weird that I used to smoke and they cannot imagine me ever smoking. Others cannot believe how the time has flown by. For myself, I look back and cannot seem to be able to think about it without a lot of conflicting ideas. I smoked for a long time, but it seems like I have a tough time remembering it because, I think, it was more something I did in the background and it was just this constant thing I always did.

The dreams have stopped, they ceased about maybe four-five months ago.

At this point, I think you would have to put a gun to my head if you wanted me to touch a cigarette to my lips. I cannot see myself ever going back to that.

For those of you just starting out: Surprisingly after day 30 I felt great, and by month three I knew I was done 'done' and around the four month period I did not think about it much. These days, it is not something that comes up unless I look at my badge here.

Anyway, thank you all here in /r/stopsmoking/, this place was my rock while quitting.

Next Monday is my quit date. I’ve quit before but always went back. My anxiety is high and climbing as the day gets closer...

First time I quit (cold turkey), I stayed that way for over a year, but a stressful situation gave me an excuse to pick up a pack and I was right back on the train.

Second time I attempted, I used Chantix, and I will never do that again. I quit for only two weeks.

Third time, I quit for almost 6 months using nicotine patches, which only seemed to draw out the anxiety during the first few months of quitting.

I’m back to believing that cold turkey is the only way to do it for me... but my anxiety seems to be building as this last week of smoking dwindles down. It’s like my brain is already going through the withdrawal, or anticipation of those symptoms, and it makes me think about having a cigarette more often than usual. I was trying to cut out some regular smoking breaks, but now I’m thinking about them at times I normally wouldn’t.

Just curious if any one has experienced this when leading up to their quit date. Mostly I think I just wanted to vent, so thanks for reading.

It's time..

I've told my friends, girlfriend, myself and family that 'I'm going to quit' so many times. But this time I am truly ready to rid myself of cigarettes. I had myself in such a good mind set the last time I tried to quit and this went on for around a month, but then I had a moment of anger which caused me to relapse. It makes it harder to quit when my friends and girlfriend smoke, but I feel as though if I overcome cigarettes whilst around smokers, it will increase my willpower tenfold. 

This time, I'm not going to make any excuses. I know it is all in my head, and no matter how real it may seem, I've just got to brush it off and remember that life is so much better when you see past the veil of smoke.

Wish me luck!

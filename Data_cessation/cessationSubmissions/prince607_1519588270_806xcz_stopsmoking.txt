One Cigarette Last Night

Hey everyone, I just wanted to vent and get some advice from you guys. I gave up smoking as my new years resolution and have kept up with completely until last night. Last night I went out with a coupe of old friends. We got drunk and I had a crazy nicotine craving. I usually always have gum on me for these situations but I left my pieces at home last night. I bummed a cig from a girl on the street and regretted almost immediately as soon i started smoking it(I'll be honest I still finished the cig). I woke this morning just mad and disappointed at myself. That was by far the longest I had ever quit before. Any tips you guys have to deal with the guilt and make sure this doesn't become a full blown relapse would be much appreciated.

How do you ask someone not to smoke when you are visiting them?

I know this isn't quite what this subreddit is for based on the posts I've read so far, but I'm hoping you can offer some advice. 
My parents are smokers and have been ever since their teens. When I visit them with my partner they can smoke about 4 in an hour each. (I don't know if that's a lot in your eyes but it seems like a lot to a non smoker in the room!) We usually end up staying longer due to our visit being for one of their birthdays or a family get together and being something of a party. So say 3 hours. I always leave with a head ache and feeling sick and my partner always leaves with a head ache and stinging eyes. We usually feel better a little while after we've gotten home and showered and put fresh clothes on. 
How do we politely tell my parents that their smoking is making us feel ill and that we wish they wouldn't smoke in the house while we were there, or at least smoke less if they won't go outside?' 
We don't want to be disrespectful or upset them.

I quit smoking both Weed and Cigarettes...Started working out too.

I quick 10 days ago after 10 years straight of daily nonstop hardcore usage.  Also, started working out same day, best I can...

BUT

My brain doesn't feel any different without smoking weed for the 10 days...I still feel like my mind is not clear and I just feel dumb still, like all my brain cells are fried and i cant put sentences together well at all anymore and my mind just thinks differently now.......Will this ever go away?

Also, as far as the Cigarettes...My mind still wants a Cigarette out of habit, just because I'm so used to smoking them. Will my mind set ever change to  where I won't think of a Cigarette when I want something to do?

I also started to workout somewhat to keep me busy, it has helped slightly...But I'm still having hard time at times...My goal is 6 months of this...This will be all worth it at the end of December when I look back at this right???

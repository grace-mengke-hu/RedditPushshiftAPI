One week mark.

Last Monday I had felt sick and figured I shouldn't smoke since I wasn't feeling well.   Then figured, why not another day?  Well now it's been a week and I'm feeling great! A book that was recommended to me by a nice person on this forum, Easy way to quit smoking by Allen Carr, has helped tremendously!  I still have those pangs and anxiety, but the book has helped nip it in the butt.  Anyone have other ways to quiet down the angry little monster inside that just sits there whispering to you to have "just one." when you know damn one is too many and 1000 is not enough?

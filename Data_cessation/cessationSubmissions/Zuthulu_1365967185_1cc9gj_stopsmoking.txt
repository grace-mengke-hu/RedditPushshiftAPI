Day one's almost over, and i'm managing surprisingly well so far!

i can't remember i've not smoked this long in 10 years. I did have one puff of an electronic sigarette somewhere in the afternoon, although that didn't really do something for me.
I had a busy day, plus it was the first day with really nice weather and lots of things to do in the citycenter. This probably helped, although it took me forever to go to sleep last night. 
The nights are probably going to be the hardest, and trying to avoid the patterns that are linked with smoking. All the tobacco/ashtrays are  gone, i'm already glad that my desk is cleaner, without any ashes scattered here and there.
On to day 2!

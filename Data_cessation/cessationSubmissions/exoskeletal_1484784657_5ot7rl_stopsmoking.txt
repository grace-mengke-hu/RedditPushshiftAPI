Almost three weeks in, cant get over overwhelming fatigue.

Finally got around to quitting and resetting my badge again. I quit on the 29th of January, this time for good. The withdrawals were much less severe this time. I didn't have the intense frustration and ease to anger that I've had in previous attempts. I chewed about a pack of regular minty gum a day and ate my weight in sunflower seeds in the first week. Now things have gotten much easier. I might have a small craving per day but nothing very intense.

The only thing that's really hard now is this overwhelming fatigue. To understate it greatly I am EXHAUSTED, ALL the time. I can barely force myself out of bed after snoozing and debating calling in sick every morning. I wake up fairly often at night to roll over but nothing crazy excessive, maybe once every couple hours. It's really starting to affect my performance at work and in my relationship though. I can barely keep my eyes open at work and am most often too exhausted when I get home to do chores. 

Does this fatigue normally stop? I've got a checkup with my Dr on Friday and I'll talk to him about it. It doesn't feel like depression, but I'm not sure what that feels like.

A week, for the second time

I feel like I have to explain every post now: my dog died, it killed me, I started smoking again, I quit again.

I’m over a week in, and it still hurts sometimes. But mostly, it’s better.  It’s all psychological at this point, but that doesn’t make it easy.  I am seriously back into the “bargaining” stage 😜

Just wanted to share that...yes I quit, yes I want one, no I won’t have one.

Not doing too good with quitting

I LOVE the feeling of smoking after a long day. I honestly find it enjoyable and relaxing. I KNOW that quitting is *right* and i got a shit ton of gum and i even got a tongue piercing  a little while ago (because i wanted one and) to help with the oral fixation aspect. I haven't touched a cigarette in 4 days, that's it, just four fucking days and I feel like I can't settle down to sleep or watch TV or anything before unwinding with a smoke (or 3). 

I want to do this and i will do it, i wish it wasn't so damn hard on me though. Any advice?

If it matters i already work out.

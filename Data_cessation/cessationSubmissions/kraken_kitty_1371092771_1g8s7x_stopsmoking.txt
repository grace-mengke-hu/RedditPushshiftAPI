Is It The Right Time?

I mentioned in a previous post that I've been going through a lot of stress.  The fact is, I've had 3 panic attacks since I quit because of the stress build up, and it's taking a toll on my entire life.  



I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't work, I can't even think properly.  I was at a group today and they said that if I'm having panic attacks, then maybe it's not the right time . . .  Should I wait for a bit and see how far I can take this?  I don't want to end up destroying my life just for the sake of quitting, but if I slip up I'll be letting everyone down . . .



I feel so confused and upset, I don't know what to do :'(

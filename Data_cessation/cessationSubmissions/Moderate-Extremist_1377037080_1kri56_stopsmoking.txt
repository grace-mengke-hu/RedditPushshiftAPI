Just a couple questions about quitting. Dealing with stress etc.

I quit smoking two days ago. I decided to take the easy way out and went down to a local e-cig shop and picked out a nice, upgrade-able refillable e-cig. I was just wondering if anyone else had tried to quit smoking while substituting other forms of nicotine but still found themselves craving the hell out of cigarettes? I feel like i'm getting the same amount if not more nicotine in my system throughout the day, but i've found myself extremely stressed, unable to sleep, frequent headaches, everything you'd expect if I had just gone cold turkey.. Is this normal?

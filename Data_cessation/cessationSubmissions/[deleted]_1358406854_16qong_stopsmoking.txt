I want to quit - tomorrow will be day 1. 

I have been smoking on and off for about 12 years. I started at a party in college and after that night, I really didn't smoke a lot, but I got a job at a gas station while in college and I started smoking pretty much every day because my boss smoked and would always tell me and another guy that it was time for a smoke break and we'd go outside and smoke. I met my wife and moved to Atlanta and she didn't know I smoked because I only did it when I was on the road. I got a promotion and was stressed out and started smoking more and more, but never around her. Well, she cheated on me and we got a divorce. Since I've been living alone, I started smoking more and more, but I want to quit for several reasons.

First, I want to quit because I know that it is unhealthy. Second, I want to quit because I see my mom and her health problems and I know that they are related to her smoking. Third, I want to quit because I have had 3 grandparents die from cancer and I don't want to fall into that, too. My sister is getting married tomorrow and she just beat brain cancer and I want to reduce my chances of getting cancer and having her see me go through what she went through. I have a very close friend who has encouraged me to quit a lot and I want to prove to her that I can do it. 

I bought some Nicorette gum today and I want to quit. I'm on the road all the time and that's when I feel the urge the most. 

Before I even get the first response, I want to say thank you to everyone in the community here for all the kind words of encouragement

It's been thirty days!

After thirty days of not smoking I can tell you this: everyone in Stephen King stories smokes. Everyone. Babies. Vampires. Pennywise (google it). It’s annoying. I can breath better. I feel better and more accomplished. I like spending money on books instead of cigarettes. I am happy to not have to go outside in the sun burning my retinas out to smoke. My cough is almost gone. Almost. We’re getting there.

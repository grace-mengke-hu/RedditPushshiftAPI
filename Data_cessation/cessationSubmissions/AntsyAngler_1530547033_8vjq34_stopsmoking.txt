Not resetting my counter: priceless.

I have stumbled soooo many times on this quitting journey.  Usually I mess up when I'm hanging around smokers.  This weekend I went to play disc golf with a bunch of friends and they were smoking and drinking but I didn't bum one.  Instead of feeling envious as I saw them light up, I felt glad to be a non-smoker.  I think this is a turning point.  

Many Mondays in the past I'd have to reset my counter because I'd smoked over the weekend.  I'm very happy that I didn't smoke this last weekend.

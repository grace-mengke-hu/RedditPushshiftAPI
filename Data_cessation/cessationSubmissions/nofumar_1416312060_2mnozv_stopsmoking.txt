I'm back and ready to succeed this time! Just a few questions....

Okay so I've tried quitting a number of times but this time I've got my SO quitting along with me and I've really just had enough of feeling unhealthy so I'm gonna give it another go. Just a few questions for people who have been successful;

I walk everywhere, and walking cigarettes are of course a big thing. What do you suggest I do to "occupy" myself while walking since I haven't been used to being unoccupied?

How long should I go without drinking? This is going to be the hardest, because this is where I always relapse. (I'm in college and around it a lot.)

I want to work on exercising but I've been so scared to the past two years because I get out of breath so easily:/ how can I start out slow without getting discouraged by my lungs ability?

How can I make sure I don't gain a ton of weight because that's definitely a big fear of mine which has contributed to my list of reasons for NOT quitting?

Any and all help and words of encouragement are appreciated, I really really want to succeed this time guys. Have a great day and good luck to y'all!!

A day shy of two weeks and my confidence is high

Thank you /r/stopsmoking. Finally I have found an active community who is dedicated to what I am beginning to accomplish. I have been tobacco free for 13 days now. I am motivated to keep going, I read your success stories and am filled with a rush of spirit that will help carry me to new heights.   
I look forward to my two-week mark tomorrow, and know that I will not be smoking a cigarette again. I am using an e-cig occasionally, but I anticipate leaving this behind in the near future. Keep me in your well wishes, as you are in mine! Kick the habit! Breathe fresh air! Reach new heights! You can do it!  
**Edit:** Thanks for all the support! Looking forward to sharing further successes with everyone!

My biggest test.

So, it is just over 5 weeks since I had my last cigarette, but today was the biggest test of my journey thus far.

My parents live about 400 km away and came up to the city to visit. No biggie, except my parents both smoke and even when I was 'not smoking' I would always smoke when I was with them.

Today I didn't. Not a puff, and I am about as proud as I have ever been of myself. I really feel like this is a permanent thing now, I am a non smoker!

First day

Just stopped smoking today. It's been OK so far, but I feel so strange. A bit of a vague feeling, can't really explain it. Threw away my sigarettes yesterday. Just tried to take them out of the garbage, realized how very sad that is, poured cleaning liquid over them and threw them away again. Going running now! I can do this! Just need to remember myself why I'm doing this.... Why was that again???

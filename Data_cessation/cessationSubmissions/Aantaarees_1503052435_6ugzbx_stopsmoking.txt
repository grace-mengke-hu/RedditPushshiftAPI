After three weeks I have relapsed. What to do?

Hi. I have only smoked three cigs since yesterday.

 But allow me to clarify the context: my country has been hit by a terrorist attack. Not at my city, it was in Barcelona. I felt such a frustration, anger that I could not swallow it. I am aware I should stop soon (right?). But anger is building up inside... it is been two years I have wished in my mind: not in Spain please, not here! Somewhat praying. All I want to do is to scream and cry.

My rational mind is like: smoking aint gonna fix nothing, while my body needs to get the bad vibes out.

I don't know I guess I should listen to my mind and not give in to whatever my body wants.

Not sure if sick or nicotine withdrawals. Terrible sleep, shitty mood, low energy

I used to have a pretty high nicotine tolerance, although I didn't smoke a lot (used to snus Siberia, which is 43mg/g) at most maybe half a pack a day. I've been tapering off slowly and started chewing gum recently. Although the cravings seem to fade for the most part, I've been feeling like shit recently, the worst being insomnia and my poor mood.

I haven't slept well for three days now and I've had some minor tingling sensations in my body as well as back pain when I sleep. It feels like it could just be a cold, but although my throat is a bit dry and sore I'm not coughing a lot. 

What does /r/quitsmoking think, am I sick or going through nicotine withdrawal? 

**TL;DR: Back pain, shitty mood, insomnia, fatigue. Sick or nicotine withdrawal?**

Anyone else quitting today?

Let's do it together! Do you have any plans for when you get cravings? I think the hardest part for me is going to be during my breaks at work and after I eat and while I'm driving...or, pretty much all the time! We need to just keep telling ourselves that IT'S NOT WORTH IT!!

24+ hours cigarette free after 10 years

just over 24 hours without a cigarette. i'm telling everyone because i feel that will be the best way to stay supported and active in doing this. i just can't smoke anymore. i'm too old to keep telling myself i'll stop one day. i need to do it NOW and i'm DOING IT now. here's to no more cigarettes!

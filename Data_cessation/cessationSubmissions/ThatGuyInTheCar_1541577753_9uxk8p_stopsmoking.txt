I caved and fell down the Mountain, starting the climb again.

So after nearly 300 days from Not Another Puff, I was so stressed and angry I choose to buy a pack. I say chose because I was not craving a cigarette, nor had any inclination to start again. I still had on off cravings but my inspiration to quit was my family and I officially called myself a non-smoker. Even after finishing that pack I was still not hooked. It was after the second pack I went and bought that had me going for 2 months. I really enjoy smoking weed and then having a cigarette to finish it. Every pack I kept telling myself again and again it was my last. But there was guilt from starting again. I got further than I ever did before, almost a whole year, my longest before that was 3 months. I was so upset and disappointed at myself.

Well the disappointment is gone, no more self loathing, there’s only determination. I have done it before and there’s no reason I cannot do it again. I stopped smoking weed as this is what I did last time until I know I can do it without wanting a cigarette. I will hit my year, I just reset my flair, it hurts to see it at 362 (last 60 days smoking, I was living a lie). I would jump on here to encourage someone just to see my flair and what I threw away.

I know I didn’t throw anything away, and those 300 glorious days of not smoking I didn’t stink, I was working out, I was not out of breath, I could smell and taste better. Here’s to 300 new days. What worked the first time was you guys. r/stopsmoking really helped me get through the hardest days and toughest cravings and I wanted to say thank you to everyone and I look to you brother and sisters once again. 

Thanks again.

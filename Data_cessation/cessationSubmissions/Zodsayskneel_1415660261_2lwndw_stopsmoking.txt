After 16 years, I put out my last cigarette last night.

I've been smoking regularly since I was 18. I'm done with it. I've already read through Carr's "Easy Way" book, but I must've missed something. The first time I tried to quit after reading it a couple months ago, I was crazy-irritable by the time I got home from work, so in fear of saying something I would regret to my girlfriend, I ran out the door and bought a pack. I don't want to be this way again. I've been doing fine all morning, but now it's about 3pm and I'm starting to get urges. Any advice you folks could throw my way would be appreciated. Thanks!!!

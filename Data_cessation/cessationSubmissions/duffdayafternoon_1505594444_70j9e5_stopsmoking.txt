Day 10, favourite perks

I am loving how my teeth feel so far! Is that weird? For years it felt like my teeth were almost gritty except for straight after brushing now they feel smooth and clean. Every time I get a craving I run my tongue over my teeth and take a deep breath. Anyone else got an unexpected perk they're loving? Stay positive!

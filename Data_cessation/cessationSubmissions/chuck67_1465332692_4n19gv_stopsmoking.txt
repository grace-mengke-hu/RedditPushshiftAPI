Smoking an ecig. Relapse?

Hey guys. I have been cig free for 4 days but today i let curiosity get the best of me, and purchased a blue ecig. I feel awful for putting the nicotine back in my body but does this count as a full relapse since im not putting the smoke/tar back inside my body? Also will this affect my recovery from smoking longer? thanks

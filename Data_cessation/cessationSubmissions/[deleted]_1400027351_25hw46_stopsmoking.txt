Quitting smoking?

Hi friends. im a 22 year old guy who has been smoking since i was 11-12 years old amount increased with years, now i smoke around a pack a day while sitting in front of the computer. smoking is a big habit of mine, when i walk when i have eaten, when i wait when im in a stress situation where there is small break in school etc.

Any advice on how to quit would be highly apriciated. im considering to start getting into shape also. but i always feel like smoking after running etc. 

but again what have helped u, and how could u advice me into stopping this ugly habbit of mine

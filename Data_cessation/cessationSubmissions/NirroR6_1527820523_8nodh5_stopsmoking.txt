How do I help my grandma stop smoking?

My grandmother, 57, has been smoking a pack of cigarettes a day since she was 16. I, being 16, despise cigarettes. It kills me every time she lights one because I look at it as Longterm Suicide. And I just want my grandmother as long as I can, and I know as long as she’s a smoker it can reduce her life span.

So I’m wondering how do I go about helping her quit? Someone please help.

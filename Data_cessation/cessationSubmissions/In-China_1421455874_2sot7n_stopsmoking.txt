The power.

I tried quitting in the past, but kept going back. Since last July however I have not touched even one cigarette. I realized in the past when people asked me if I wanted to smoke, even though I was saying no I quit, my body language and tone was telling people "actually I have been craving one like crazy. Hell, why not?" and people would push me till I folded. Now that I have quit (already half a year) I noticed people don't egg me on to have a smoke, because now when I tell them I have quit, I am full of conviction. My tone and body language is not just saying "I was once addicted, but now I am finally over with this" but also "I had the will to rid myself of this addiction finally" and I have seen envy in the eyes of my smoker friends. 

They have already stopped trying to reclaim me as one of "the smokers".

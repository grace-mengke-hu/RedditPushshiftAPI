30 days, F yeah!

What have I learned with 30 days of not smoking under my belt? I learned cravings keep coming, and yes they suck. I learned that regaining my sense of smell is to always a good thing lol. I learned that living with smokers makes it tougher than it should be. But I also learned I'm strong enough to over come any obstacles, because as much as I may want to smoke, my want to not smoke is greater.....

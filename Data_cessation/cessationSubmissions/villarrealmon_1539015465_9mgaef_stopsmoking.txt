Do nicotine withdrawal symptoms come back after small relapse?

Hi everyone,

 I had been smoke free for three weeks but on friday I went out with some friends and I smoked like half a cigarette. 
Last night (sunday night) I had trouble sleeping and today I'm feeling super anxious. I'm wondering if it's possible the withdrawal symptoms are coming back? 

What can I do to reduce the anxiety? (Besides not smoking again haha)

Thanks guys!

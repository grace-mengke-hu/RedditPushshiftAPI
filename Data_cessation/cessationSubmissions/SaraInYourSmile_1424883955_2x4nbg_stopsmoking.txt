Day 4 - Whew!

I woke up this morning and didn't even comprehend that it was already day 4 (which is awesome)! Guys, I can't stress to you enough how much exercise is helping me.  After a good workout, I feel so fantastic that I have absolutely no desire to pollute my body.  I'm also eating well, making all of my meals, and barely using my eCig (0mg juice).

I still feel a bit like I have allergies.  I'm sneezing a lot and get really congested, but I know that's all part of the "Quit Cold" because I've had it before.  If you aren't exercising, and you're struggling with your cravings (even if you aren't struggling with cravings), get out there and exercise! Do something at home, take a walk, go to the gym, but do something.  The sense of self-worth you get will propel you in to the next day of being a non-smoker!

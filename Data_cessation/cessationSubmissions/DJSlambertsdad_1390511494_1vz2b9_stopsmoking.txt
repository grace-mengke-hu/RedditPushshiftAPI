Seven day strait without a smoke or nicotine makes one weak

At 8:00pm this evening it will be seven consecutive days with no nicotine. The last 3 days were more challenging than the firs 3 and today the mental games have really started. The wife (who does not smoke) let for her sisters for the weekend. My mind starts driftingâ€¦ I can smoke 1 pack while she is out of town, Hell I have not had one in a week and who would know! I have been here many times, I think if it is no big deal why does my skin start quivering when I entertain the thought of back sliding? Brief moment of clarity, because I am addicted and one smoke resets the whole withdrawal process. Try hard to think I am not depriving myself of anything but am ridding myself of a deadly addiction!!! I have failed so many times before, but I can make it till 8:00pm to get my one week!!!
Then I will start the fight for day eight.

30 hours in

I made a post here yesterday about how I’m quitting cold turkey. 

Well, 30 hours in and I think I’m dying. The cravings are so bad, my chest is tight and my stomach is crazy. It’s probably not helping that I decided to quit during my time of the month. All I can think is that I should just give up and try again another time... but another part of me doesn’t want to give up my progress. 

I forgot to mention that I am an angry bitch. I cannot talk to someone without snapping at them. I feel bad, and I’m also very tired. Ugh. Thanks for reading.

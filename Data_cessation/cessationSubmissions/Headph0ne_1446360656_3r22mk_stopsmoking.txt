I'm worried about my body...

Hey Guys, 

Avid smoker here since I was 14/15 and I'm 26 now. I'm worried that it's too late... like my body is fucked and I know it. Later on time will catch up with me and I'll get the news, I have lung cancer. 

It's a terrible though that actually keeps me smoking. It's like this depression that sets in and I can't shake it, so I light up. 

I need to stop. I can go days without a cigarette without an issue, but if stress builds up, I can't control the crave. 

I need help, I need advice, and I need a lift in spirit :(

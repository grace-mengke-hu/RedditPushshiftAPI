Thankful for tips

Hey guys,

Let me tell a little bit about my self. I'm a 16 year old boy from Sweden. I started vaping just for fun for about one and a half to two years ago. From the start me and my friends tried vaping just for fun, and we didn't even use e-juice with nicotine. After a while we tried e-juice with nicotine, just a small ammount. At the top I was vaping e-juice with 30 mg's of nicotine. Later on we tried our first cigarettes. I had tried a cigarette one's before and hated it. I said to myself; "I'm never going to smoke agian. But as time passed, me and my friends started smoking cigarettes. 

I think it was the vape, and nicotine in the e-juice that got me "hooked" on nicotine. Now I get cravings and abstinence if I don't  smoke a cigarette every day.( or more ). So here's the deal, do you guys think I can get a chance to stop smoking and quit cigarettes if I start vaping agian.  
* Vape with less and less nicotine
* And after a while don't vape any nicotine at all and the stop vaping witchout getting craving or abstinence.

Thankful for help and tips!

No more excuses. I quit.

Hi,

My name is 101stTimeLucky and I'm a cigarette addict.

I've probably quit 100 times, sometimes for months, sometimes for only hours. This time I'm hoping it's for real.

I've spent years as a secret smoker. I've watched my dad die of lung cancer. I need to openly admit I have a problem, and have more than just myself to rely on.

I'll be back often to start with. I plan to post whenever I'm about to snap in the hope it distracts me long enough to make it through the call of the addict.

I reckon I'm 8 hours clean, probably the easiest 8 hours I'll see for a while.

If you're also fighting the monkey on your back, good luck to you. PM me if you think it would help.

Would really like to quit vaping, and I've tried many times and failed. Need advice.

Hi, not really sure how I'm going to quit vaping. I took up vaping to get off cigs and now I want to quit nicotine altogether.

The hardest part is feeling depressed after 3-5 days, that's usually about when I relapse.

Advice would be appreciated I guess.

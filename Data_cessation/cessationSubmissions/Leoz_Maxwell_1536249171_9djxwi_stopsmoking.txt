6 months

It honestly doesn't feel like anything special. I have tried to quit smoking approximately 1,269,370,418 times. The key to making it this long was simply just ignoring the fact that I used to smoke all together. I didn't download any apps, I didn't ask anyone to hold me accountable, I didn't try to avoid my friends that smoke, I just ignored smoking all together. Thanks Obama.

Just remembered I quit smoking

**Day One** – I posted on here, it was ok. Bit rough but I felt pretty amped up from just stopping.

**Day Two** – Thank god it was Friday – I drifted through the day at work, barely even felt like I was there. Just had headaches, felt so much angst, hit my knee on a metal filing drawer next to my desk. Punched it for a while. Hurt my hand. Work colleagues are all non-smokers so didn’t really get any sympathy from them. Then went to see Lion King the musical. Terrific.

**Day Three** – Saturday! Slept for a lot of it. Smashed back coffee for a lot more of it. Went to Ikea. Went to girlfriend’s house as she was having a house-warming party. Had a live band in the front room. Didn’t drink (didn't trust myself that early), just had water. Sang with the live band in the front room. Concentrated on not smoking by telling everyone I was quitting and had stopped a few days ago.

**Day Four** – Sunday. Woke up feeling fresh, no hangover, didn’t smell of smoke, no sore throat, no headaches. Sat down and watched United beat Liverpool – felt good. Had coffee, bit lunch as a treat, went home and watched John Wick.

**Day Five** – Went to work – felt fresh!!! I can’t get across how good I feel – just not tired at all, my eyes don’t hurt, I’ve barely needed to touch coffee today and until just now forgot I was even trying to quit.

I’m doing it!


p.s. Definitely had a few temptations though but just followed people’s advice and sat through it telling myself why it’d be a bad idea. Goes away after a while.

Checking in. Eight and a half months.

I'm doing good. I've stopped thinking about them constantly. However I still use an e cig at night for like a "wind down" or whatever. I'm pretty sure that's not as bad. But I'll still have to quit that eventually. The real thing does not disgust me like what happens to some people however I have no desire to smoke an analog.

Good luck to everyone and myself

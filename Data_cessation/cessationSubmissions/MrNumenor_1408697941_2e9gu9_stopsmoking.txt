Long time lurker deciding to make a change in my life

I have been party smoking for about five years now and smoking a pack a day for about half a year. I realize more and more that smoking is so unneccesary, bad for my wallet and health and I'm going to stop cold turkey tomorrow.

 The biggest problem is that my roommate, which whom I hang out a lot, smokes a lot. I am really determined to stop and was wondering if you guys (and gals) have any tips to not give in to the temptation...
Any help would be appreciated!

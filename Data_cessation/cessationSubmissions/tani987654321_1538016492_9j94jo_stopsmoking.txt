Any past smoker here with asthma? Has quitting helped your condition? And if you work out, does it get better after quitting?

I have asthma and I’ve been trying to quit for the past 2 years but each time I relapsed. The addiction to nicotine got so strong that I kept smoking even after I was diagnosed with asthma the previous year. Recently a hiking trip made me realize what I was doing to my lungs and made a resolution to stop smoking once and for all. I would like to know if there’s anyone over here who has been/is a smoker and also had asthma. Did quitting help with your asthma condition (shortness of breath, wheezing and coughing) and does working out get easier in the long run?

I would really appreciate your insight regarding this. Thank you so much! :) 

P.S- it’s my 5th day without smoke and I am getting pretty bad cravings from time to time

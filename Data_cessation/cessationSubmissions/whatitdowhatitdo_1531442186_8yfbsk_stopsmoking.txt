Problems with Nicoderm patches not sticking

Hey guys quick question

Do the Nicoderm patches have a tendency to not properly stick? I tried two different spots and this second patch has completely fallen off as well. They are pretty expensive so I don't want to keep wasting them. Is there a spot know to hold the patch well? Should I tape it up?

Is the patch still ok to use if it falls off? I'd rather not use a third path in the span of five hours.

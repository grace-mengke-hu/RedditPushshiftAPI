Quit again 19 hours in.

Just wanted to say hi. I've been a smoker for 12 years and tried to quit a few times. Recently was smoking 30-40 cigs a day.  Been waiting for a good day to nut up and try to quit again.  For some reason I had the kick to try yesterday and here I am.

I've decided to try nicotine replacement via a vaporizer.  Kind of feels like cheating because it's going pretty easy so far.  Last few times I tried going cold turkey and always struggled for the first few hours let alone days. 

I'll be checking I here for some motivational reading for a while, thanks guys.

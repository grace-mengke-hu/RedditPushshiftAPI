6 Months - Surprise Triggers

I've been going strong for 6 months now without a molecule of nicotine (go me!). This past week the cravings snuck back into my life. I haven't craved like this in a long time, but have been staying strong. I think I found some new triggers I have to defeat that I wasn't really aware were there. I've been doing lots of home upgrades and renovations lately, and apparently a few of these tasks are strong triggers for me. Painting a room by myself - I've done this many times, and historically would always break the monotony by taking regular smoke breaks. I was surprised at how badly this made me want to smoke.

Additionally I was cutting up a bunch of wood for some shelves I'm building outside, and again the cravings hit hard. I actually caught myself reaching into my pocket for my non-existent pack of smokes and lighter in the other pocket... then getting frustrated for a moment thinking I had left them inside. It took a good 10 seconds to fully realize I don't smoke anymore. The brain is very strange. 6 months later and it's still trying to convince me to smoke. I don't, I'm better than that, but it was a bit of a surprise.

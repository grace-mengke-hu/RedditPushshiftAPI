I had a gum graft 6 days ago and I haven't had a cigarette since before the graft...but I'm about to cave and just have one. One can't hurt right?

I needed the gum graft for a non-smoking related situation, but the number one cause of gum grafts rejecting is smoking. I was at about 5 cigarettes a day, sometimes less, sometimes more, you know the drill. I've been smoking about two years, and have tapered down to one cig a day for a while, had weeks with none and weeks where I basically chain smoked. Never cold turkey. 

Anyway, I had no idea how bad I'd feel. "I mean 5 cigs a day? That's really not that bad" I told myself, "it'll be easy" I said. IT IS NOT EASY. I need this gum graft to heal properly and the last thing I want to do is ruin this. BUT dear lord in fucking heaven, day three I was an actual monster, now I'm more emotionally stable, but am having less success at reminding myself why "just" one would hurt.

How do you talk yourself through the "just one" head game?

Finally quit by using medication. I don’t crave, even though I live with a smoker!

There is no “one size fits all” when it comes to a successful stop. We all know that. So, let me start by saying medication might not be the way for you. Or it will work out just as great for you as it did me. My doc prescribed bupropion. Brand name is Wellbutrin. 

You guys, i finally quit! 

It’s been like 6 days. I didn’t even notice at first. Over the last month on bupropion, I cut back from 10/day to one every day or two. I’d bum from my husband (who is not ready to quit and I’m not arguing with him about it anymore). The after dinner smoke was the one I couldn’t shake. 

Man, I feel so free! I even had a beer out at dinner and didn’t want to smoke. I’m going to stick with the medication so I can get a good amount of time under my belt before it’s just me. I’m hoping after a couple of months I’ll be in a good place on my own, and by then maybe my new freedom will rub off on my husband. 

I still think about smoking a couple times a day, but it’s more out of habit than desire. And the withdrawal has been nonexistent. Which has made it so much easier than every other time I’ve tried to quit. This is the longest I’ve made it outside of pregnancy!

I love this community. Thanks for all the sharing, stories, and kind words to one another. The encouragement I see in this sub finally made me talk to my doctor and I couldn’t be more grateful.

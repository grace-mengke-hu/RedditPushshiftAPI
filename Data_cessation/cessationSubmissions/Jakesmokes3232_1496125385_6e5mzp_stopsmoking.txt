Not sure if I want to quit...

I've learned from this site nicotine leaves the body in 72 hours. Well this weekend I couldn't smoke and it was easy. But as soon as I was home I started smoking. My wife pretty much quit a few months ago but I cheat every time she isn't around. Anybody else in this situation?

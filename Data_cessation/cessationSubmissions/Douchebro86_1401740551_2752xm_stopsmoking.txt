I waited 365 days to post this

No big motivation speech here but I feel the need to tell you, the reader that if I can do it you can too. Short history: I smoked a carton a week for nearly 15 years, was the life of the party and even on occasion I would smoke Marijuana. Funny enough the last night I had a cigarette, I had a few bongs too and was as high as a kite. Partying was toned down after I quit and I haven't touched marijuana. Since I decided to make the lifestyle choice to quit smoking, I manage to do so much more with my life... call it, a life of fulfillment. I can run (did my first 21km in January and now average 40km a month, remember I did NO training prior to this), I can cycle, I have so much more time on my hands. I feel happy and healthy. I judge smokers and see them for the weak people they are. I don't smell and my self-confidence has shot up 10 times. If you're even considering doing it think carefully because everything is going to change. EVERYTHING. If you decide to do it stick with your decision and don't give in. Don't give in. EVER. Remember your end goal and remember how you don't want to suffocate to death. Think of your body and all the things you can do with all the money you save. For instance, I am going on a overseas trip and my smoking money from 1 years savings are paying for this. No bullshit. Don't give in. Decide what you want for yourself. Decide what you deserve. Decide what you are worth. You are stronger than you think.

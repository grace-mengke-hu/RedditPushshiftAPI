Quitting nicotine today.

I'm 32 years old and have used nicotine in some form since I was 16. I smoked cigarettes all through out high school and mostly switched to vaping 5 years ago.

My mother has cried numerous times asking me to quit using nicotine. I decided today is finally the day. I woke up this morning and threw the remainder of my cigarettes out and tossed all my vape stuff in the trash.

To be honest I'm terrified. I feel like I'm so used to smoking/vaping that it's become a friend/crutch. I dont know how I'm going to learn to break the mental addiction and manage my stress.

 I almost feel like someone has died. I'm so used to just smoking out of pure boredom and nicotine has always been my friend while going through dark periods in my life.

I'm scared but determined. Can anyone with a similar experience offer advice? How did you break your habit? What helped or didn't help?

Guess I'm quitting?

So i just started a new job at a tech company. Right now im waiting on a background check to go work as a sub-contractor until it comes back i go to work 8-5 and do nothing. I mean absolutely nothing. My boss works in a different state and my co-workers here are way too busy to notice im not doing anything all day. 

So every hour i have been going out and smoking. I have been smoking for a little over 5 years and about a pack a day. Me and my wife make good money so quitting is more of a health concern than a financial one right now.

I have been thinking about quitting for sometime now and yesterday i forgot my pack of smokes at the house when i went to work. No big deal i dont really work so i was just going to go to a gas station at lunch and get a pack. Went to the store and they didnt have my brand. Figure i can just wait the few hours and smoke my own at the house.

After work i take my hour long drive home thinking about smoking and almost nothing else. Thats when it hit me that i should stop. I was speeding and driving more recklessly then i normally do trying to get home so i could smoke. Called my wife and told her to throw my smokes away.

Now it is day two and again i am at my work desk doing NOTHING. All that has been on my mind is going to a store or asking a co-worker to bum a smoke (the guy 3 cubicles down smokes Reds) I have no one to talk about this right now and decided to post it here. I thinking putting it down has made it easier idk though.

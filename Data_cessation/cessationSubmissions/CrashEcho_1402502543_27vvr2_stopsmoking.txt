How did you do it

Did you go cold turkey? I've been trying to quit, well not really but I want to quit and having a lot of trouble. Have tried cold turkey and I always break, I've tried having only half a pack n I just wind up smoking the rest anyway. If I try and go cold turkey its always on my last one and then I just think about it all and break and go buy a pack. So how did you start

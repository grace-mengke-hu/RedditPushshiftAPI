2 days and a lot of gum

Long story short, I've decided I'm done with cigarettes and had my last smoke Saturday night. Didn't really do much planning and have been working my way steadily through a box of some off brand nicorette I had from a previous attempt to quit. I guess I'm worried about when the gum runs out. I need to get over nicotine but I can barely keep it together with the gum it seems. I feel the gum is just delaying the inevitable shit show of complete nicotine withdrawal. Thoughts? Should I just keep buying the stuff (it's expensive) or just face the shitty music and go on from there?

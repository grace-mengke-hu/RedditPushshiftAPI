7 Days, 18h, 51m. Much better today.

Got myself a badge to celebrate. Have some stomach issues, nausea and heart burn, that started last night, not sure if they are related. Tension and anxiety have diminished from yesterday, hopefully for good. I think that this sub has been the difference for me. Many thanks to all here.

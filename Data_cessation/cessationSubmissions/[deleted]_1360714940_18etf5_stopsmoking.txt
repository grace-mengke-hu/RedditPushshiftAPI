Day 2 and Going Strong.

Quit yesterday and it hasn't been horrible so far. A big motivation factor popped up last night, when a girl I like texted me, saying she wants to do a 2 hour hike and (later on in the day) dinner on Valentines day. Perfect timing I guess. Stay strong guys, and keep looking for those silver linings.

In honor of 100 smoke free, I wanted to share something.

I've quit in the past and maintained an "I'm no longer addicted, so I can have a few every now and then" mentality. I was good, I could go weeks or months without one... But somehow I always ended up a smoker again. 

This is the first time I've quit without looking back, and I don't see myself ever smoking again. I'm no longer focused on not being addicted, because no matter what I will always have that slight addiction. I'm more focused on cutting them out of my life and never EVER touching one again. This change in mentality may be saving my life, and it's been the most effective method so far.

Just some thoughts, and of course for all of you beginners, it gets easier!!! Stick to it! 

Side note... I happened to be so lucky that my boyfriend, my two best friends and one of their boyfriends quit all at the same time as me. This was SUPER helpful knowing that I'm not constantly reminded of it. If you can, stay away from your smoker friends for a while (or get them to quit with you) at the beginning. And as always, shoutout to r/electronic_cigarette for helping me get where I am today, even though I no longer use an e-cigarette (I reccomend them highly for quitting!). 

Thanks for reading :) 

Edit: meant 100 days smoke free.

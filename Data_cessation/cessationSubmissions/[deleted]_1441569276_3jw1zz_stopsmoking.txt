Any herbal remedies work for anyone?

Hi all 
Im asking this for my girlfriend. We’re giving up smoking together. I was off them for a long time & slipped back on after a couple of weeks heavy partying but iv given up before so confident enough to go cold turkey. My GF feels like she needs some help & is looking at champix. Side effects look a bit crazy & we wanted to ask if anyone has tried any herbal remedies that’ve actually helped in any way to ease withdrawal symptoms.

Thanks very Much

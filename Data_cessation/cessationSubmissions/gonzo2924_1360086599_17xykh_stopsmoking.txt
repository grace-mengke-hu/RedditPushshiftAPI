1 YEAR TODAY. F' YEAH. 

I was a pack a day, give or take, smoker for 17 years. Smoke free for one year today. Hypnotism worked for me, if anyone is having doubts about it. I tried patch, cold turkey, pills, etc. I know it's not for everyone (out of the 9 friends who went to him, 6 are still not smoking) but it was only $200 for my guy, the same as the patch system. 

[This helped](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/ng8ge/if_youre_still_a_smoker_who_is_ready_to_quit_read/) as a reaffirmation the few times I was craving. 

[Here's my post](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/u0fgz/hypnosis_has_been_great_for_me_so_far_and_9/) regarding hypnotism and how it helped me. 

Good luck guys, you can do it.

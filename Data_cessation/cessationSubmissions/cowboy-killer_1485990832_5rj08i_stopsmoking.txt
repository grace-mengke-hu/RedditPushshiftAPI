just passed the 6-month mark, tobacco and nicotine free. Thanks, everyone

I just wanted to check in and let you all know that I have stayed quit and hit my 6-month mark yesterday. I smoked for 20 years. I still have cravings occasionally. Seems like they get more frequent around milestones like this one. But they are manageable and don't bother me. I have no actual desire to smoke and wouldn't have a puff if you paid me.

The stuff that helped me the most was Allen Carr, the smoke-free app, this subreddit, and a quit smoking hypnosis program that I listened to on my smartphone while I fell asleep at night for the first couple of months quitting. I had tried to quit several times before this, so I pulled out all the stops.

I'm so, so, so tremendously happy to finally be a non-smoker again. The simple act of breathing fills me with a sense of calm and relief. Encountering my former triggers makes me so happy because they remind me that I don't need to think about cigarettes anymore. I'm planning to stay vigilant (there is no such thing as "just one" for me, as I have learned from past experience) but I am also feeling a confidence in my continued success that I intend to enjoy to the fullest :)

Good luck to all of you! This sub is an amazing resource and I am so lucky to have benefitted from the support here. Thank you all and cheers to a smoke-free tomorrow!

Finished Alan Carr’s book and decided to go for it.

The book really helped with the mental part of it. I really haven’t had a terrible time so far. It’s been a little uncomfortable but having the “brainwashing” removed or at least reduced has helped. The physical withdrawal isn’t that bad. I’m not using any NRT, which I have never done before. I’ve “quit” many times, for long periods a few times, by using the patch, e-cigs, Wellbutrin, etc.  This has been the least painful so far.  I really think not reinforcing the thought that I *need* nicotine is a big part of it.  If you want to quit or have recently quit and need help getting your mind right, I strongly recommend this book. “Easy Way to Stop Smoking.”  I first heard about it in this thread and purchased it a long time ago. I finally read/listened to it. I’ve been free for almost 48 hours.

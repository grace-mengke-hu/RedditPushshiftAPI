4th day and going strong

well, well, well.

today's the 4th day of my quit, and things look perfectly OK at this point. sure, i've had a few cravings, but all were very minor and most have lasted all of a few seconds each. none has gone beyond a couple of minutes, and every one has been fairly easy to ignore, simply because i'm telling them to shut up and get out.

i haven't tried to change my usual habits - still drop in at the same stores for coffee on my way in to work, except i sit inside or get in the car immediately, instead of hanging around to grab a smoke.

no change to coffee consumption, though a couple of those have somehow replaced themselves with tea. have had a drink too, since quitting. so that's not a trigger any more.

sleep is completely screwed up. i go to bed at 9pm, wake up at 4am one day. the next, go to bed at midnight, wake up at 5am. that's crazy, but i'm guessing it's going to even out soon.

everything that can remind me of smoking does. when something has been your lifestyle, it's so bloody deeply embedded within that every waking moment is filled with weird thoughts of smoking. not cravings, just thoughts.

again, thanks, /r/stopsmoking! it's working :)

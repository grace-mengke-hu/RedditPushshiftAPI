I'm quitting again and need help

I'd like to have the mentality that after my last cigarette that I'm a non-smoker now but once the nicotine wears off I'll be craving another one. I need some serious advise on how to deal with the cravings. I'd like to stop spending so much money on them, I'd like to smell nicer, and I'd like to do it for my girlfriend.

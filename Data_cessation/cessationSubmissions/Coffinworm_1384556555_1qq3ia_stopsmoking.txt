Day 3 - It gets better after this...right? (rant)

Of all the attempts to quit smoking, I've never been able to make it past day three. I feel so drained of energy, and just mad as fuck at every little thing. I tried to go out and play some disc golf to keep my mind off of it, but ended up just getting pissed when I made a bad shot, and I'm playing my first tournament in the morning.


The patches are helping, but they're messing with my sleep badly. I'm waking up 4-5 times a night because of the weird dreams. I want to just say fuck it and smoke until after the tournament, but I've already made it this far, and I'm way more serious about quitting than I ever have been before. 

Sorry for the rant, I just needed to vent. I could definitely use some encouragement.

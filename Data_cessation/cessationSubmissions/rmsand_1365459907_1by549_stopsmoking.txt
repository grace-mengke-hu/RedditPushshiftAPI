Quitting was easier than I thought, you can do it too!

I had been wanting to quit for a long time, I was practically chomping at the bit, but had a lot of fear and anxiety about it. Browsing this sub really helped me. Since everyone was gushing about it, I got Allen Carr's audiobook even though I was highly skeptical. I had quit once before when I went to Basic Training for the Army, and was off them for almost a year, but fell back into that trap. I realized that I had been smoking for about 10 years, and that it was really making me sick. It was time to stop.

I smoked my last cigarette in my life on Friday, March 29th. Allen's advice was nothing groundbreaking, and there was no secret. He just gave me a new way of looking at the situation, and dispelled a lot of my fears.  I'm not trying to be a shill for Mr. Carr, but his book really did help. It is just really good advice, no gimmicks or tricks. 

Quitting was not nearly as hard as I feared, because the cravings are not as bad as I thought they were going to be - just an irritation that fades eventually. I haven't replaced them with food, or gum or e-cigs. I just had to let them pass. I though it was going to be very hard because everyone in my office smokes, and it is a slow and boring desk job. Even being around 3 heavy smokers, I can still survive and not go crazy!

It's all in the mind, you can do it too! You can be free! If you are thinking of quitting, I can assure you that it actually can be easy!

Just realized I passed my 6 month mark the other day

I'm not very active on this subreddit; I just come here occasionally because it's the only place I recorded when exactly I quit.  I never thought it would be so easy!

EDIT:  Allen Carr's Easy Way to Quit Smoking is what helped me quit, in case anyone was wondering.

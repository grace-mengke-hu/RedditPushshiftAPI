Social situations after quitting smoking and how do you handle them?

Long story short, I work in a big office with a lot of people. It's usually very busy here and smoke breaks are basically the only times when we get to socialize. I have a few people I really enjoy hanging around with during those smoke breaks and we've even naturally synchronized our "smoking schedules".

Now, I haven't quit yet but I want to, and the only thing that keeps me from doing so is the fact that I'll basically have to forget about my smoker-friends which I enjoy hanging around with every hour or so.

How do I deal with this? Again, it's a busy office and those smoking breaks are a great opportunity to hang out with people and distract your brain from work for a few minutes.

I could, of course, just show up without a cigarette, but there's smoke everywhere (disgusting) and it will look awkward. So that's probably not an option. I really don't know what to do.

Has anyone been in a similar situation?

I'm quitting today.

I'm sick of always thinking about when will be my next chance to smoke.

I'm sick of being unhealthy and out of shape.

I've quit for a few times but I've came back, but this is my first time posting to this sub. April 1st was day one. I plan on checking in tomorrow night (April 2nd) to report back. 

Thank you for your support

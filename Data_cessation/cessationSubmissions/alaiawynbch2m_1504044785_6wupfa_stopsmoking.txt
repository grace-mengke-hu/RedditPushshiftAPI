if you believe you can do it, you can. apparently, I'm a nonbeliever

There as as many quits as there are smokers, or so my doc says, and I guess she's right. I've read and still read about successes and failures cold turkey, with patches, with gum, with vapes, with custom combinations of some or all of the above. I have tried most of them, too.
The belief part must be the hardest part. It is where I continually fail. I know one has to quit for oneself, but I do get envious of the folks quitting for their kids or grandkids. I don't have any of those. I never will, either. "Gee, if only I..." that's pointless thinking.
I've made two serious attempts so far this year and looking back, I did see such lovely, positive changes during my smoke free times. Why can't I hold onto those memories? Why is it so much easier to say 'you can't do this! Who do you think you're kidding?'
I don't buy smokes any more. I bum them off other people, so I am saving money but still gets me no closer to where I want to be. And makes me a mooch. That's just great, isn't it?
Rather than ramble longer, let ask this- how do you hold onto the positives, keep them forefront in your minds? Post it notes? Journal?  Open to any and all suggestions. Please.

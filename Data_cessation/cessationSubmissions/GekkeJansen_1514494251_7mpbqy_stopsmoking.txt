Today I relapsed after a week, but I'm kind of happy I did

I quit smoking a week ago, and since then I've vaped on and off, but not as much as I smoked. I also read Allen Carr's book(yeah odd combination I know lol), and I agreed with pretty much all of his points except one, smoking tastes bad. 


My vape is of good quality, but it never felt the same to me. I always had in my head that smoking cigarettes tastes better. It killed me inside that I would miss out on cigarettes forever. I found a couple of cigarettes in my house a few days ago and today I just thought fuck it why not. I smoked but after two puffs I threw it away.


IT DOESN'T TASTE GREAT AT ALL. My fantasy is crushed, EVEN my vape that I hated for a week tastes better than fucking cigarettes. I'm kind of disappointed in myself but you know what? Now I know it doesn't taste great at all. I won't reset my SmokeFree app because this is a great lesson on the journey of quitting. I washed the pack and threw it in my garbage can. Fuck you Lucky Strike, you don't taste great at all. 


TLDR: Relapsed, took two puffs, it tasted awful and now my fantasy that smoking tastes better is crushed. Now I can finally quit knowing I won't miss out.

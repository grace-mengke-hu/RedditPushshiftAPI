11 weeks. It's getting better. Hang in there newbies.

I don't think about smoking every day anymore.  I went skydiving recently and realized the tandem jumper smelled like cigarettes.  It didn't really bug me.  After the jump, he lit up and we all sat around visiting.  I didn't really think anything other than, *"I'm glad I don't smoke anymore."*

So stick with it guys.  It really will get easier.

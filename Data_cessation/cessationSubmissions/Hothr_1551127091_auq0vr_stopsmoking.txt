296 Days ago, I quit smoking. 10 days ago I quit vaping. Its easy being clean.

Easier: Don't have to worry about smell, don't have to carry a pack, and fire.  Don't have to carry batteries, juice, coils, and worry about pocket leaks leaving you smelling like cotton candy.

Vaping was in many ways worse.  I would take sips off that all day like it was soda pop.  I tapered down to 0.3%, then found I didn't really like 0.0% (Surprise, it's the nicotine you like, not anything else!).  Finally ditched my equipment in a remote trashcan before leaving for a week.  A change of scenery definitely helps.  Feeling OK, and getting sushi tonight!  (You can taste it a lot better when you aren't smoking)

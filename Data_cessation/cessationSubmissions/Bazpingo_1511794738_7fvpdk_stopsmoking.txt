Oh hey. Almost two months.

And I never thought I'd be able to do it. Been smoking for about six years - started around 20. Always told myself that I'd say "oh, I USED to smoke in my early 20s". Then 25 hit and I kind of rode out the year thinking it still counted as my 'early' 20s. 

Cue a deathly viral throat infection that kept me out of commission for a week which really helped. Didn't smoke all that week and that was just a viral infection - my doctors said it wasn't even necessarily related to the smoking. But I realized what I was sort of setting myself up for. 

Haven't smoked since then. I have had cravings but I'll share the mindset that's really helped - my own 'cheat code'. As a (now ex!) pack a day smoker, no matter how shitty or awful my day is - no matter how much stress I've endured or how many times I've fucked up - if I end the day WITHOUT smoking a cigarette it means I automatically end the day on a win. And that's done a ton for self love.

I also realized how smoking and ruminating on minor stresses blows them way out of proportion. 

Keep up the good fight yall!

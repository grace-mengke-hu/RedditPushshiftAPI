30 days!

After being a half pack a day smoker for about three years I'm glad to say it's been 30 days since my last cigarette. This past week I faced my greatest challenge. Somebody outside the library asked me if I had a lighter, and when I dug one out of my backpack he offered me a smoke. He had my brand, parliament light 100's. I could feel the shape of the pack in my hand. I could feel the resistance of the cig as I pulled it out of the pack. I embodied the ritualistic experience in my head, I was so so tempted, but I told him I was good, and now a month in, I truly feel that way.

Lessons learned from West Wing

I was watching West Wing today and they were talking about how and why employees often steal or commit fraud, and it really hit me, because cheating and having a cigarette really is fraud on yourself. 

It's all based on this fraud triangle. If people have 1. Need,  2. Opportunity and 3. The ability to rationalize the decision, people will commit fraud. 

I used it all day when I had cravings and it worked just thinking about it. But if I can deprive myself of one of the sides of the triangle, I think I can avoid cheating. 

For instance today I saw a guy smoking and I had 1. Need because I was having a craving 2. Opportunity because he would probably give me one if I asked. So I had to fight like hell not to rationalize having one. Then I quickly got in my car and drove away to remove the opportunity as well.

Day One

So, I'm at day one.

I have written down all my reasons.  I have calculated how much money I will save. I think I'm ready.  I'm only 22, and I've been smoking since I was 16. I fully enjoy it, and that's why I've always had trouble quitting..  But I know that it's just the nicotine messing with my mind.

I think I might do it this time!

I have a small daily planner, and I plan to write a little blurb in it every day.  How I'm feeling, what my body is doing, and keep adding up how much money I have saved so far.

I really hope it works!

Giving it a go again....3rd times a charm.

Just looking for some encouragement.
Yesterday I decided that it would try to quit again. Since this is the third time I feel much better about it. I am just ready to quit cigarettes for good. 

I quit for two weeks three months ago. I felt great but it took a few drinks and a night out with people who smoke to have what I had accomplished come crashing down. 

So if you have any advice on how you dealt with quitting it would help out a lot.

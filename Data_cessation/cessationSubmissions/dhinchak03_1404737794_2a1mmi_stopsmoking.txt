18 days. Things look brighter now!

I can't believe it has been 18 days without a single puff. Even in two weeks prior to that, I've had only a couple of cigarettes (I used to have 2 daily).

It feels great. I no longer feel like smoking. It was raining over the weekend and I feared it would be a big trigger. But no! I just don't feel like smoking anymore. 

About the withdrawal symptoms, I still feel low on energy and digestion is a bit haywire. Things are definitely improving though, I will get through it.

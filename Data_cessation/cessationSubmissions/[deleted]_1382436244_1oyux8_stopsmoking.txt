I was just sitting here at work and realized: I have really quit?!?

Do you also have this moments sometimes? You just sit or stand somewhere and realize "DAAAMN, I really made it. I have finally quit after struggeling for so long.". Kind of like one of those dejavu experiences.

I couldnÂ´t feel more awesome right now. I feel so healthy and in control.

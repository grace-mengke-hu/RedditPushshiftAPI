So I was in the store today...

It was a very emotional day. A lot of thoughts and whatnots all piled into my head. I got out of work and stopped into the store to pick up a bottle of wine and some chocolate. The scenario of asking for cigarettes went through my mind as well. I even stared at the lighters by the register. Then I saw it. The Chapstick. I started thinking about the different flavors of Chapstick that are available to us. I mean, I could have my pick of strawberry, cherry, lemon. Who knew there were so many to pick from. Before I knew it, I was sitting in my car eating the Hostess Ho-Hos I had just bought. And no cigs or lighters were purchased. :)

3 days smoke free, 1 day nicotine free, after 8 years,

I smoked since my teens and wanted to stop since my early twenties.
Now I am 25 and after a party on saturday night I didn't smoked all of sunday, I just used 2 nicotin gums I had lying around. Monday morning i used another, but I am nicotin free since then. Today was really foggy and I felt like I had really low blood preassure all day. I feel like my lungs are pressurized and sometimes i get a small stabbing pain in my chest.
I resisted the urge to smoke today when i was with smoking friends (and had a Beer!). But tomorrow I will be with a chainsmoker all day and I am a little afraid. Hope I stay witty and don't fall for the tricks my mind plays me. I just wanted to share this. Maybe it helps me. :)

4 months quit after 15 years on them. We are about to close on our first home. I'm scared.

The thought of one of us losing our job or something happening to keep us from affording our mortgage is really putting the image of puffing away back in my mind.  I know between her and I quitting it's saving us like $400 a month which I consider to be quite the sum in itself.  These big life developments bring back that demon that's for sure.

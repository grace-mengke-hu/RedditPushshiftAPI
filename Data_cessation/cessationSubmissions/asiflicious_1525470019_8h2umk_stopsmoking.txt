3 weeks

Hey guys this is my 3 week anniversary of being smoke free and it’s been suspiciously easy. Aside from the fucking brutal canker sores it’s been smooth sailing. I haven’t been getting cravings and a week ago I tried a cigarette and it tasted disgusting. I threw it out after one drag. It’s almost like I just woke up one day with an aversion to cigarettes. I hope it stays that way. I feel guilty for having such an easy time though and I really feel for the people that don’t have it as easy as me. I wish you all the best because the difference is astounding. I’ve been much more energetic and in a better overall mood ever since I quit. I finally feel my age again.

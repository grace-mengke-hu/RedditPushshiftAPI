Lapse after 12 days, disappointed...

I decided to quit smoking for the new year.  I feel this time I am ready.  I just don't want to be a smoker anymore.  My husband still smokes, this weekend we were kid free and my craving was so bad that I couldn't shake it.  I took one of his smokes,  then another,  and ended up smoking about 7 over 2 days.  I'm back on track today.  Put my coat and shoes on to go buy my own pack,  cried, and took it all back off and took a shower.  I rarely post on any social media,  but hoping that making myself accountable will help me stay focused!

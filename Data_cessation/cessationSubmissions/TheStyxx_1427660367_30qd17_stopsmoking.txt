I relapsed after almost 5 days and I'm not sorry

Smoker for almost 2 years. I'm 23.

I had 2 attempts at quitting: first time after I've read Allan Car's book while I didn't smoke for 1 month; 2nd time a few days ago when I've gone cold turkey.

Hear me out. It was easy to quit, way to easy. Maybe that's why I relapsed. My main reason to quit is money related - it's not about health.

So today I got some money, bought a pack and a soda and sat on a bench. It was a deliberate action. I knew what I was getting into. I wasn't craving too hard, I wasn't in a bad mood - nothing triggered my desire to smoke. I didn't enjoy it nor it didn't gross me out. It was something normal, casual. I wasn't sad because I broke my streak, I wasn't happy/dizzy after the nicotine intake. 

I know it's easy to quit - physically and mentally - but I can't seem to be able to change my mindset to be about health and not about money. I guess that I wanted to fail because I didn't quit for the right reason - health.

Anyway, I wanted to post to acknowledge my failure and to say that I'll listen again to Easy Way. If the audiobook won't trigger a change in my mindset, I will use the money reason again, but in another way: I won't be smoking again until the money spent on cigarettes will be 5% of my monthly income. I'll have to hit $2000/month to afford this bad habit.

Maintain your streak and don't act like me!

FUCK I gave in

Fuck this shit.. made it 8 days and caved.. first 7 days were not too bad, physical withdrawal wasn't too bad either but today was a freaking nightmare. Heavy depression, dizziness and involuntary muscle twitching all over my face.. plus the extreme brain fog that caused me to accidentally format 2 hard disks on a production server.  

Damn I wish I would die to be honest. Life with cigarettes sucks ass, life without quitting cigarettes sucks even more.. I can't fucking take it any more

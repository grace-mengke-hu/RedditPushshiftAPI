I hit rock bottom

Working from home on my day off. Perfect reason to have a smoke. Didn't do anything I would not have. Went about my day after WAB. Got some customers I had been trying to nail down forever. Now I have to open my store for real.

I was vacuuming and realised I am giving weed way too much of my time. Way too much. I can do everything just as well if not better without it. Going to throw it all into the compost heap and let the worms shit it out in a month or two. Feed my winter roses with it.

Getting good at those boring moments is job number one. I might just catch up on sleep or start writing on Amazon again.

I am indebted to all of you strangers.

I've only smoked cigarettes for ~3 years, but I grew up with siblings and other relatives that smoked and always hated that they were willingly hurting themselves. I don't know why I got on the habit or what I was feeling/thinking. Point is I am only 19 and was just accepting the fact that I'd be a smoker for the rest of my shorter than average life. Thanks to one day of discovering this subreddit, hearing all of your stories and struggles, and a little willpower, I put out my final cigarette butt in the parking lot after work last Thursday morning. It is now Tuesday of the following week and I feel so free. I've even started reading Allen Carr's book just to reinforce my mind that I can't go back. I would just like to Thank all of you for giving me a new outlook and happiness in life. Also, how do I go about getting the timestamp flair? Would love to be able to keep a record of how long ago that I put an end to this nasty habit.

EDIT: Ended my other habit of not reading side info on subreddits. Found flair :)

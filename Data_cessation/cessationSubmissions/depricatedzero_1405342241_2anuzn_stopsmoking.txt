Day 0. Waking up has been hard.

Started Chantix a week ago, set today as my quit day. Threw away all my cigarettes last night, lighters, ash trays, etc. Woke up this morning and didn't know how to start my routine without smoking. I'm at work now, resisted the urge to buy a pack on the way in. It's been a rough morning though.

Blunt wraps

Every once in a GREAT while, I like to smoke a blunt (marijuana-filled cigar). I don't put tobacco in it and afterward, I still don't smoke cigarettes and have no drive to. It's the same as ever; I consider myself a non-smoker. I don't get a nicotine buzz from it, I just get mondo barbequed.

After having read the post about someone having a drunk cigarette and not reseting his/her badge, do you guys count a cigar leaf as a relapse? Just wondering where you guys stood on this. I don't feel like its a relapse as cigarettes are still repulsive to me.

Day 3.

It’s been just over 3 days since I’ve had a smoke. The first day I was chewing nicotine gum until I felt like it wasn’t enough. I almost caved and bought a pack. Instead, I said screw it and bought step 1 of the nicotine patches (21mg). You put a new one on at the same time everyday. I can honestly say that after a full 24 hours with the patch, I really don’t feel the need/want to smoke. 

If you’re struggling, please consider trying the patch.

Sorry for the patch rant. I’m sure a lot of you have used them but it’s a first for me and I’m shocked.

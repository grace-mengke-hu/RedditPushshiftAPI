Quitting plan advise?

I am ready to quit. I have mild case COPD so I know I need to quit. Pulmonologist has prescribed Wellbutrin and 21mg patches. Any advise? I have smoked, used alcohol and all kinds of other drugs a lot in the past. Quit other drugs (cocaine mostly) approx. 20 years ago, quit alcohol 109 days ago, seems to me that quitting cigs is the next logical thing to go. 63 yr. old male. I have minor oral surgery today so might as well start now. Any thoughts, advise, and encouragement are welcome.   Peace

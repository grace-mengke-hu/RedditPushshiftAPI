Failed again, how to deal with Mind games ?

Hi,

So I failed again, this quit lasted just 3 days. And the reason is the same as its been for last 3 quits - Mind games.

How do I deal with them ?

Today I had made up my mind to ignore all of these but one weak moment and I'm back smoking those filthy things.

These are the mind games I'm talking about,

* It's been just three days, its alright if you smoke now. You can try again.
* I have to meet a friend tomorrow over drinks, this quit isn't going to work. Smoke now and quit again after you've met him.
* Its better to start fresh the next month.

Every-time it happens and I loose. What can I do about it ? I'm desperate.

Thanks!

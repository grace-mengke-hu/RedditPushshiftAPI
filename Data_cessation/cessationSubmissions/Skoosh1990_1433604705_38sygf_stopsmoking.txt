19 hours since my last cigarette rant

Haven't had a cigarette since yesterday afternoon. I want to punch everything in the face. If it doesn't have a face I will punch a face into it. Dear Gods why am I doing this to myself? Nicotine withdrawal is horrible. I'm never ever doing this again. I keep grinding my teeth to prevent myself from becoming a force of destruction and pain in the universe. How is it possible that coming off of 2 years on a high dose of perkoset was easier than this? Ugh! Kill all the things.

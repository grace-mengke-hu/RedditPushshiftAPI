31 hours in, or so!

... without smoking. I used the QuickMist Nicorette spray yesterday, but I haven't today! It's a major success for me, since I haven't been smoke-free for years now. 
I'm washing all my clothes, since they all smell like cigaretes (funny how I just realized today how horrible cigarettes smell!) and I'm going to clean my car tonight or tomorrow, seeing as I smoked in it and it smells horrible - and is just overall dirty. 

Yay me!

Nearly four days cold turkey...

Feel like smoking right now. Just got in a huge fight with one of my “friends” over the most idiotic shit. He’s at fault and he knows it, too bad he can’t own up to it. Anyway, don’t want anything else more than to smoke right now. I honestly don’t care about quitting anymore at this point.

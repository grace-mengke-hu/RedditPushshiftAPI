50 days - how did you replace smoking breaks

50 days in and so proud of myself after trying to quit for more than two years. I work as a consultant with a lot of computer work - with my prior smoking breaks every hour or so I was able to work 10 hours+ a day. Now I get tired very quickly and don't know how to replace the smoking breaks..any advice?

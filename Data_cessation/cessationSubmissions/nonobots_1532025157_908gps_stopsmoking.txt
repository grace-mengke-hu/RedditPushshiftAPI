I'm ANGRY

I'm going mad. I was irritable last week. I was sure it was fading away. Oh man was I wrong. Today I'm eager for a fight. I feel like punching colleagues in the face at the slightest slight. This is polar opposite to my usual self. I've NEVER felt that angry or aggressive. 

There's some added stress as I'm going on vacation tomorrow and have loads of todos to deal with. It's pressure I'm used to but now without the nicotine it's really getting to me. Little irritating things I'd be able to let go are just pushing me on edge.

Breathe, remind myself "this too shall pass". No matter what I'm on vacation tomorrow.

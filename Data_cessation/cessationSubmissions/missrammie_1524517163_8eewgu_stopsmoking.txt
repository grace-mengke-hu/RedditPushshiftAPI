Genuine not judgemental question to young smokers. What made you start?

I’m now 40, started smoking at 14 because it was cool, the thing to do, cheap &amp; no-one really knew the dangers. I’m now 2 days away from 6mths smoke free. My question &amp; I do mean this as a genuine question not a judgement just because I’m interested. With the cost &amp; knowledge of what smoking does why on earth do teens start smoking these days?

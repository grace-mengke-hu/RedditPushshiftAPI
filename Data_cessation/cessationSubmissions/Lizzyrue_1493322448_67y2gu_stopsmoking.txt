Quit date: April 29th

April 29th is my son's third birthday. I'm tired of trying to hide the fact that I smoke from him. Sneaking out while he's having a snack. I quit for a year ish before, but it seems harder this time. I started wellbutrin a week ago, now I'm working on willpower. My husband smokes too. I quit drinking 2 months ago, which was hard. But this seems harder. Anyway, April 29th! I'm so happy to have the support of this community to help me through this. Thanks for listening.

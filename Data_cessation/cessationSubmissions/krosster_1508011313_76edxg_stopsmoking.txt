Glad to say that I'm 4 months in the journey.

21, female, struggling with self. etc. So I'm on 128 days smoke free/nicotine free. (Cold turkey)
At the beginning I was very motivated and kept my mind on the positive health benefits of quitting. It was awesome (and still is) to see such noticeable differences in smell and taste. (smell more so for me it seems) I woke up last week and felt oddly surreal and grounded in reality. Quality of life feels improved. Time as well seems different some days. I guess I'm trying to say that my cognitive thinking seems shifted. And it's good. 
Lately I've been very stressed out and missed smoking cigarettes/longed for their comfort. At times when I thought I could crack and smoke one, I'd occasionally think about having to reset my badge on here.  Recently, since last week or so, I had entertained the  thought "If i were to find out I was going to die soon, would I pick up smoking again?" At first I thought maybe because "whats there to lose?" but then I settled on no. I'd want the best quality of living for my last days. 
I can say with confidence though, that I am not going to smoke another cigarette.

A whole month

I'm still here. After 26 years of smoking, my doc told me to give up or I won't see 50. It took that to make me give up. So I did. The first 2 weeks were like hell on earth.  Now the cravings have more or less stopped.  Some issues when a discussion becomes heated or if I'm bored but I've managed to not reach for a smoke.  I'm pretty proud of myself. I just keep thinking, one day at a time.

Its day 2 for me! Need advice

Hey everyone! It's been 2 days since my last smoke. I decided to stop because Of the pain it was causing me.. Also I hate the feel of a substance controlling me life.
I just need a few questions answered, I'm pretty depressed and feel like I have a huge lack of energy. Is this normal? 

Thanks again! This Sub reddit looks awesome.

TWO YEARS

Two years ago I walked into my health counselor's office a smoker, and walked out (didn't know it at the time) a non-smoker!  It hardly made sense at the time, I didn't really want to quit at all, but as the days progressed I found more and more reasons to justify the struggle.  Finally at two years, I'm starting to really feel that the struggle is really all over and I've totally moved on.

I used the patch, I had regular meetings with a health counselor at my school, I had a supportive friend, and I had you guys.  I think being able to express my feelings, and share my experiences with smokers and nonsmokers alike was key for me to keep going, and I recommend everyone who is quitting to get as many people involved as you can.  Maybe it was just me, but when I had many people interested in me quitting, I didn't want to let them down nor did I want to let myself down so it was even more important to be successful.

Every facet of my life has been improved since quitting; and while I would never do it again, I'm so happy I endured the agony for a while so I could get to this point today.  So for all you new quitters out there who are worried about getting to day 3, start worrying about how to get to day 300 and beyond, because you will thank yourself in the end and you'll be happy you made the struggle!

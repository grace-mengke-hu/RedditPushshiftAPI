Badge reset....again....

OK So I am resetting my badge again. I have been struggling with my current job which unfortunately is my trigger. And since it's my job I can't really avoid it. This has been the problem for the last month.. Typical start up story...1 here...1 there then a few here and there then I buy a pack then another then another. Frustrating to say the least... I know all the implications of this habit but I do it anyway..

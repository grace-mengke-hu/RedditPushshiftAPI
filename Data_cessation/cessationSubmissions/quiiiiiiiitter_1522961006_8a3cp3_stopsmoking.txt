Congrats, but...

I’m 12 days off smoking. I am pleased about this. But I’m also anxious, stressed, irritated, on-edge, depressed, and not in control of my emotions at all. I feel ridiculous, locking myself in my office while bursting into tears, getting angry at my partner for no reason. This should have subsided by now, right? Please help. I can’t keep feeling like this.

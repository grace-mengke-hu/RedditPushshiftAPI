A day 3 moaning session (you have been warned)

The worst things are feeling like an awful mother when I get irrationally cranky with my kids, and I know that one cigarette will take it all away and I will be nice again.  And the sadness of what am I going to do when I get home from work/when I finish the housework.  Also I'll never be able to enjoy a glass of wine again without smoking. At least I can't imagine it right now.  

The good things are checking on my stats and seeing them improving, not smelling like an ashtray and be able to hug my kids whenever not just after I've washed my hands or changed my clothes, not having to sneak around.

But cravings suck and I wish I knew when it would start feeling better. I'm on Day 3.

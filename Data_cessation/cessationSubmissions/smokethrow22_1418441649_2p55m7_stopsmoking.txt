Anyone experience lack of libido after quitting? Odd experience

29 year old male here. Ok, so I stopped smoking 3 weeks ago. Ever since I quit, I noticed I had no sexual desire. Normally I'm a highly sexual person. I barely even masturbated these last three weeks. Only two times when I was bored and I was barely into it. I'm usually a once or twice a day kind of guy, and when I get a good opportunity with a girl I'm very interested. 

Tonight I had a sexual encounter that normally I would be really excited for. Well, I was hardly even aroused, and didn't even achieve a full erection. 

Later I wanted to see if they were related so I smoked two cigarettes after my encounter. I know it's bad, but I'm not currently caught up in numbers or days or anything like that. Well, sure enough, right after I smoked the cigarettes I felt some sexual desire come back.

Has anyone else experienced this? if so, how long did it take to go away? 

I quit once about two years ago and I thought I remembered having the opposite experience, so this has been really strange.

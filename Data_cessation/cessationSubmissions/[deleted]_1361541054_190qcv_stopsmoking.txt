Overcoming a challenge right now!

My girlfriend and I are having drinks on our roof, and some of her co-workers are smoking pretty heavily. I've eyed a few cigarettes, slightly wished that I had a cigarette to smoke, but I've steered clear so far. I keep track of the urge continually, and keep reminding myself that my beautiful 8 day streak will be broken.

I will not smoke tonight. I do not smoke.

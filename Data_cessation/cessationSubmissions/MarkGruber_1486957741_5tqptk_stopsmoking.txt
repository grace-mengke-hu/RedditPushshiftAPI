Had a small victory after a potential loss

Hey all, just felt like sharing this today. I quit smoking about 3 weeks ago, and today I had a lapse of judgement. Bought a pack of cigarettes Friday night. They've been sitting on my counter unsmoked all weekend. 

Well I was very close to lighting one up, but instead ran the whole pack under some water and tossed them in the trash. Waste of money, yes. But I'm just glad I didn't cave in.

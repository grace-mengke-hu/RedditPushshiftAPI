Social anxiety

I went to a party this weekend that turned out to be not my scene at all, and I was extremely uncomfortable and anxious. I could have left, but I had reasons I wanted to stay. However, it was a terrible time for me to realize that over the past nine years, when I've felt overwhelmed in social situations, I would excuse myself to have a cigarette, and I don't have a backup plan for that now. I ended up hiding and having a panic attack, and then drinking too much when I returned to the party.

Smoking is such an easy socially acceptable way to get a break from a crowd. Help me brainstorm some other options?

Is it a good idea to buy a disposable e-cig just in case

It got me think, if i get a super bad day and i'm very annoyed and upset, i might lose control over myself, during a craving.

Is it smart to buy a e-cigarette with 0 nicotine to prevent this sort of situations?

My dad smokes and whenever i open a random drawer around the house, i find a pack cigarettes, so i guess i'm kinda used to be around the devil.

The problem is that e-cigs are not cheating and i'm afraid i start using it more than what i actually need. 

Has someone had the same problem? Thoughts?

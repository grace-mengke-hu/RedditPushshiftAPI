48 Hours Cigarette Free. On a Step 1 (21mg) Patch and Not Struggling Much. In Fact...

...in the last two days I've made it a point to engage in every trigger I can think of.  I've eaten large meals in the evening, I've been drinking a ton of coffee, I've had cocktails, and I've continued to smoke marijuana.  I've even rubbed out an orgasm or two (really helps to fill some of that newly found extra time).  Three days ago I *needed* to smoke *immediately* after (or during) each one of these activities.  It's become a source of strength and determination for me to engage in all of these behaviors without the formerly obligatory cigarette.  The self-control is that much more rewarding for me when I exercise it in the presence of temptation.

I'm breaking the habit, ladies and gentleman, even though I'm not kicking the nicotine addiction (yet!!).  Thanks to everyone for being here and contributing to this community.  r/stopsmoking has been a great boon to me as I kick this awful vice.

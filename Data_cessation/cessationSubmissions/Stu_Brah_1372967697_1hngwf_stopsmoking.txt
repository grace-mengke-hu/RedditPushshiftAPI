Recently Quit smoking

I quit smoking recently (three days ago to be exact) because health insurance at my work is doubling for tobacco users and I just can't afford to live loosing that much money.  I hope this doesn't make me sound crazy but I find myself constantly trying to justify "Just one more smoke" in my head, was this an issue with anyone else?  I know withdrawal can be ruff on people and I haven't given in but I feel like i'm starting to develop dual personalities.  I been trying to just stay busy and keep myself distracted so I just don't think about it.  I'm curious to know what any personal experience with this same thing for others idk why but I feel like it could help me to know i'm not totally crazy.

Thx

Feeling tired but unable to keep my eyes closed at night. You too?

Hi everyone! For the first time in many years I can tell myself "Yes, you are making it!"


Been a-pack-a-day smoker since I was 12. Now I'm 25 and I'm finally doing it. I tried quitting in many ways, but I always failed. This time though, it's different: I quitted cold turkey, making a clear statement in my head that cigarettes are useless and taste bad, and that I was ruining my body. 


The fact is that, during my first week (I'm actually on day 4) I am feeling super-tired (like "OMG I cannot keep my eyes open, hope I don't need to drive") , but for the life of me I cannot sleep. Last night I went to bed around Midnight and could not sleep until 3 - 3.30 AM, feeling anxiety and "dreaming" of falling as soon as I closed my eyes. Problem is I gotta use my car a lot to work and I fear that my lack of rest could become troublesome. 


Has any of you had the same problem? Does this "insomnia" usually go away after a few days?


Tl;dr: quitted smoking 4 days ago, and since then I'm feeling extremely tired but have really big trouble falling asleep. Has that happened to you? How much does this "insomnia" last?

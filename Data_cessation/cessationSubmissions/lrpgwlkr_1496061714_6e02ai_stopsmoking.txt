Quitting...again, but for good this time!

Last year I quit smoking in February and kept it up for about five months before I relapsed (I moved far away from home for the first time in my life and it was extremely emotional and stressful). Yesterday I decided I've had enough, if I could do five months before I can do forever now. So here we go, wish me luck! 

P.S. I've requested a new badge as well!

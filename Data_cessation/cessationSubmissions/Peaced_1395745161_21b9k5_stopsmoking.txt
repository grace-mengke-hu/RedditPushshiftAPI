Almost 3 years, no sensible changes. Anyone else ?

Hi all.

I've stopped for more than 2 years now, and I am surprised I didn't feel any of the upside I see mentioned here often : No better sense of smell or taste, no better breathing or breath. I just feel like I have always been. 

I smoked for about 18 years, up to a pack a day. 


Did this happen to anyone else ?

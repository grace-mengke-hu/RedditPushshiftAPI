I can't keep doing this to myself

Hello, everyone.  I'm new to this community here.  I hate to admit it, but I'm thoroughly addicted to cigarettes (nicotine to be more specific).  It all began a little more than two years ago.  I went through a very difficult time of my life, and, as a result of that, I sunk into a state of depression, anxiousness, and apathy.  Instead of addressing my issues from the inside out, like I should have, I began suppressing them with things like cigarettes, alcohol, drugs, and other addictive behaviors.  I quit the drugs, and I quit the addictive behaviors that I delved into.  Now days, I only drink in moderation and in social gatherings.  The one problem that I am left with is the cigarettes.  Nicotine is, by far, the most addictive substance I have ever come across.  It is so difficult to let it go.  I have attempted quitting on my own at least ten times now.  I always relapsed and fell right back into the same routine.  I know that smoking is destroying my health, and it is also consistently decreasing my general motivation in life.  Cigarettes are holding me back from reaching my true potential.  I don't want to keep doing this to myself even though I can see, feel, and understand the detrimental effects that cigarettes have on my life.  I smoked my last cigarette about five hours ago.  I'm not going to buy another pack.  I'm not going to bum one off of one of my friends.  I'm done letting them dictate my life, health, and mindset.

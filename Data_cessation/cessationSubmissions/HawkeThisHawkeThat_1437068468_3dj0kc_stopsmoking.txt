Strong feelings of distress and sadness?

I'm on day six of complete cold turkey and am emotionally struggling. Yesterday and today I have been extremely sad and have been experiencing waves of... grief? I knew quitting would be difficult and taxing, and that I would be anxious and cranky. But I didn't expect to feel like this. Is this common? 

**Smoking history:** I am 26 and have been smoking on and off since I was 18. I usually would smoke about five cigarettes a day.

**Mental health:** mental illness runs in my family. My brother is diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety and my sister Bipolar Disorder. I have in the past struggled with anxiety and depression, but have never seen someone for a possible diagnose. If I eat healthy and exercise regularly I feel great, so I don't find myself overly worried.

Is it normal to feel *despair* like this? There has been no other change or cause for stress in the past month for me to be feeling like this, other than quitting smoking. I just feel so panicky, anxious, worried, and extremely sad. I'm really hoping this passes soon because I am honestly struggling not to leave work right now.

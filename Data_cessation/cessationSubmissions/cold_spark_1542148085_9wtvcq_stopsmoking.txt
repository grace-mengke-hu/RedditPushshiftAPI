I have been consistent for six weeks and for two weeks now been smoking occasionally

It all started with smoking a joint on a party. Then I smoked a few cigarettes, as well. Now the pauses are getting smaller. I feel that the overall easy feeling without cigarettes is fading. I am afraid of slipping back into addiction. I am invited to a birthday party on Friday and am thinking about not going. But quitting smoking by isolating yourself, is not the solution to me. Apart from that I am not doing much with friends, because of my studies. I want to get over this addiction once and for all. Sometimes I have the feeling that I am afraid of making it, because I come so far to then destroy all my progress. This has happened before three years ago. I actually also want to quit weed forever, but sometimes I think I can grant me a reward. Then I just feel numb and regret it.

What has helped you to get over this struggle once and for all?

Need the support more than anything.

I have come to the realisation that after 10 years of smoking cigarettes and a year on an E-cig (still using it) I need to quit, Mostly for the usual reasons, Health, kids ect, but also to prove to myself that I can, Throughout college (UK) I always told myself I wasn't addicted, this was a lie, I was lying to myself because I didn't want to face my dependency and deal with the issue.

I would like some advice about how to do this, when the cravings kick in what should I do, I know to keep my mind focused on something else but the cravings always found a way through and got the better of me (except for once but a story for another time).

In 2 days I will run out of E-cig liquid and that will be the end and the beginning, the clock starts then.

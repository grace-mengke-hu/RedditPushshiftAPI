Been trying to quit since January 2016

In 2016 I quit 3 times, with the patches.  I really like the patches.  I can go off of them and not smoke.  I can be around people smoking and be fine.  What gets me to smoke again is either being really bloated or experiencing a big change like moving or breaking up with someone.

This year I am on my third go, things have been rocky with my girlfriend.  We are back together, and I see my next rough patch where I need to stick to it being my busy season at work in the fall.  It gets rough.

The thing is I hate smoking so bad.  I feel like crap, I am anxious all the time, it's harder to practice consciousness.  I have to quit after a few weeks of smoking because I hate it.  I am on the patch again today, threw away my pipe tobacco and gave away my cigs.

What tips do you have for when I am off the patches (i'm going to do each step twice this time I think), to remind myself how much I hate it and how it isn't an answer but worsens my problems?

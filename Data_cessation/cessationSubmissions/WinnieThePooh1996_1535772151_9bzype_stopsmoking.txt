I don't know if I will ever quit smoking.

I'm 21 years old, I have been smoking since I was 18. I have tried to quit in the past, most recently within the last couple months, in which I called 1-800-QUIT. They sent out free patches and gum, but I only lasted one week before I started back up. Quiting is also difficult due to the fact that my boyfriend of 3 years is a smoker as well. It's a vicious cycle, he quit smoking, I started back up, enabling him to start back up as well, and recently when I tried to quit smoking, he started smoking again, so then I did as well. We are very close and supportive to one another, it is just very difficult, personally I have bad anxiety which is one of my "triggers" for smoking. I am also a recovering addict, and I feel smoking is the only release I currently have until I find a healthier way to cope. (Addictive personality, going from one thing to another) I really want us to quit, together, he is willing to, I just don't know if I am ready yet with everything that is currently happening in my life. I know I need to quit, my bf has asthma as well as heart problems, and I not only have asthma, but also a problem exhaling air from my right lung. I'm sorry for rambling on for so long, I just thought by posting here, maybe some fellow smokers could understand. Please don't judge, I just needed somewhere to vent and be understood, maybe even receive some advice from you guy's. My family (non smokers) just do not understand how hard it is.

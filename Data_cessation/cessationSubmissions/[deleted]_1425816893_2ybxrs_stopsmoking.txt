For the past few months smoking has been grossing me out, but now my damn lips are turning brown.

Lately I've come home from work and noticed big brown stains on my lips where my smokes hang from my mouth.  I've been walking around in public like this and nobody said a word.  I've been a smoker for almost thirteen years and never had this problem until recently.  It's so freaking gross that I'm embarrassed by it.  My job requires a lot of face time with the general public and I must interact with a hundred different people a day and I can't believe I'm walking around with big brown stains on my lips.  So here goes nothing... I'm requesting a badge.

No selfâ€”control. Reset my timer.

So going to a festival this weekend i got drunk and smoked again, i hate myself for it, 1 month and 18days because i cant control myself when i drink, i'm so ashamed of myself. I also see my alcohol use as a problem now so i need to stop that completely as well. 

 Never going to give up, fuck smoking and fuck addiction.

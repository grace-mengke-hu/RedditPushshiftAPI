One year

It was about this time one year ago that I smoked my last cigarette. 

I just remember being so sick of feeling controlled by cigarettes. How many do I have? Do I have to stop before work? Should I stop on my way home or go out after dinner? 

It was decimating my bank account and wrecking my health. I'm thankful to have made it a year and I'm looking forward to many more smoke-free. Never thought I'd get to a place where I could be happy and comfortable without a single cigarette around, but it didn't take long into the process. I wish everybody luck wherever they are in their quit, keep up the good work!

Starting nicotine patches for the first time tomorrow after over a dozen unsuccessful attempts to quit.

Iâ€™ve done anti depressants (helped me quit smoking but made me depressed), gum (made me sick) and cold turkey (oh the mood swings). Tomorrow I am trying nicotine patches for the first time. Any words of advice or encouragement?  Thanks!

More discipline since quitting

Is it me or does it seems that not smoking (or at least quitting) had benefits others rarely mention?

I feel like ever since I've quit I've been more disciplined at work, working harder and more focussed. I've been working out at least twice a week one way or another. And I keep my room a lot cleaner than I used to. 

Could this be a non-smoking related thing? Taking better care of myself in all aspects? Or does not living from smoke to smoke allow me to focus on what matters?

Anyway, just wanted to share :)

I sleep too much since quitting smoking and my performance at work and studies has gone down as well. Did this happen to anyone else?

So its been nearly 75 days since I quit smoking. I was a 6-10 cigs per day smoker for almost 6 years before quitting. I'm 25 right now. I started using NRT both gums and ecigs. But since the past 3 days I've rarely used any NRT.

I dont even get cravings usually, but when I want to study sometimes I think it'd be cool if I still smoked. Because that'd be the incentive I'd give myself after finishing x number of pages etc.

Also, earlier I was able to sleep for 4-6 hrs and be absolutely fine in the morning. But now I just can't do anything less than 7-9.

Anyway to counter these two things?

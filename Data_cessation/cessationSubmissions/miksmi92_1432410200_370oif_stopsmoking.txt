Just had my last cigarette!

I smoked since I was 15, I am now 23.I had quit smoking last June, and then stupidly decided I could have "just one pack" on my birthday March 2nd. Obviously it turned into way more than just one. I am hoping it is easier this time, since I've only been smoking for less than 3 months. Anyways, wish me luck!! I hope my boyfriend and I don't bite eachothers heads off this time.

My boyfriend is finally quitting on Monday

I was a heavy smoker for over 10 years, but he's been a *very* heavy smoker for 15 (I'm talking two packs a day). He's always been absolutely reluctant to quit and all of a sudden he drops that he's quitting on Monday :)

Now my question is what you reckon the best way is to help someone quit, as an ex smoker. 

I'm distrusting my own instinct because during the first two months of my quit, I either complained all the time, or raved about all the posts, books and videos I came across that made my quit easier and that made sense to me. Quitting was all I could talk about and think of. Obviously as someone who spent a lot of time with me - and as a heavy smoker himself - he was fed up with the subject and I suppose on some level he  always resented my quit (We were both cynical twentiesomethings and all of a sudden I was exercising and reading books on smoking cessation - he was never particularly supportive). Point is, he was always annoyed that I'd go on about it so much. So now that he's quitting, I want to keep my interventions to a minimum (like  just a few pieces of advice, for instance) but I know it will be hard because I'm very excited that he's doing this and my desire for him to succeed my override my prudence.

So I was just wandering if you've helped someone quit, and of you have some ideas that worked or have any suggestions as what to avoid.

Cheers :)

Down to 3mg juice after almost 2 weeks...

Started off quite high in juice nicotine content... I think about 10-15 mg? In a week or two I'm going to go on 0 mg juice... It has been a great process... but also keep some 3mg juice on hand incase I get those cravings that make me wanna pull my hair out. I have not had any cravings. I had a party last night and everyone kept congratulating me on my quit, it made me feel good. I drank and kept hitting my vape. I am a proud non smoker.... even if I do have a slight craving I know it's all in my head :)

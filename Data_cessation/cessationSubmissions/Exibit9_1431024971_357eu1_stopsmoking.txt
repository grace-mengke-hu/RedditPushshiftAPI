It's been a year and a half. The struggle in the beginning was so very real I lost a girl friend over it. I don't foresee myself picking up the habit any time soon, but the amount of emotional progress I've made is staggering. 

My friends over yesteryear (smokers mainly) refuse to treat me like a normal person. I feel bad for them, which is why I still make it a point to be there when I can. 

I'm just simply amazed that I've sat next to a lit cigarette perched on an ash-tray and didn't once think about smoking it.

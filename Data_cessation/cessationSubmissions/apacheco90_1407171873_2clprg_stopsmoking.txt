I realized the implications of my actions

I quit smoking last october because I found out my girlfriend was pregnant and I wanted to show support we quit smoking together. I lasted until Febuary then smoked for about a month before giving it up again in late March. I then pick it up again after my son was born in late May and have been since. My girlfriend started smoking after my son was born too. We were both outside smoking last night when it just hit us like a ton of bricks. WTF are we doing?? So we smoked our last cig at 7:36pm last night and I am hoping third time is a charm!


P.S. I'm having trouble resetting my Badge.

This is so hard, and I don't know why...

I'm in the middle of reading Carr's book. I've read it in the past and has helped me. But I just can't seem to stick with quitting. I work at an animal hospital, I hate smelling like an ashtray when I'm at work, it makes us look bad. So today I went my entire 11hr shift and a few hours after without one. I just cracked and bought a pack. I wasn't even stressing out or anything, it just felt like I had an emptiness in me.

I feel like crap now that I'm on cig #2, I just can't seem to let it go. I love being smoke free, I can smell everything, everything tastes better, I'm less anxious, I can take deep breaths, and all the other good stuff that comes along with quitting. I JUST CANT STICK WITH IT. Anyways, I guess I just needed to rant, tomorrow I'll try again. I want to quit before my nephew comes into this world (my sister is expected to have a baby boy in the next few weeks) and I don't want to let him down. So I gotta stop for you, Benjamin!

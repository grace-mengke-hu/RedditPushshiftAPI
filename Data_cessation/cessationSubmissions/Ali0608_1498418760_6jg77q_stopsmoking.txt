Struggling :/

I know it's my brain, and I keep fighting with it, but I'm 36 days now and still feeling like I'm really missing out.... I miss smoking :( I've put on 5lb which is making me feel miserable, I'm not feeling the amazing energy boost that I'm supposed to feel, nicotine is winning my brain/emotions at the moment and I'm feeling hard done by even though I know how horrible it is and how bad it is for me. Part of me feel's that I'm not truly ready... I got ill and couldn't smoke (I didn't want to whilst ill ) so as I didn't do it for 2 days I was like, I need to continue not smoking but I have a feeling I will cave in... trying to be strong as I've done so well!! I'm still a non-smoker, but at the minute I can't see me being a non smoker for ever. Why did I ever start :(

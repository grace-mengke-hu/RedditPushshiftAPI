Nothing is certain but death and taxes

When you smoke, you get plenty of both. The death part takes some time but the taxes are immediate. By the time I quit smoking, I was paying around $5.00 a day and about $1,825.00 per year in taxes for my personal pleasure of wrecking my health. The government was like, "This fool is addicted and can't quit so let's snag up all his pocket change". Fugging government. Guess they're gonna have to find a new way to shake me down.

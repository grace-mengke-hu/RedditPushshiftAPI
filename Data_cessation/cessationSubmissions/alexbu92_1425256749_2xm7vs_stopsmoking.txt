So I have finally found the motivation to stop smoking, what now?

I've gotten my mind through finding enough personally important reasons to stop smoking and today has been my first day in this journey. So before going to bed I go on reddit and search for a "quit smoking" subreddit and sure enough here it is, I look towards the sidebar for the usual resources/F.A.Q/basics links but nothing,it's empty. 
So what I wanted to ask is: Once you get the motivation down how do fight the other part of the battle, the nicotine deprivation? Because motivation is very effective against psychological enemies but against chemicals it doesn't work so well in my experience. Does nicotine gum work? Temporary usage of electronic sigs? Or maybe natural substitutes,distractions? I know you can probably soldier through it with just pure motivation but I'm an engineer and I don't feel satisfied if I'm not optimizing everything I do.

Quit 32 days ago

My cravings aren't so bad that I'm going to smoke again but they're there and they make focusing intently really difficult.

I'm having trouble coding, which is something I decided to learn seriously.

At first I thought that cigarettes gave me the ability to beast out work for long periods of time, but then I realized that was just me being an addict.

I'm not sure if anyone even noticed what I'm talking about but how long does it take those more mild cravings to where you miss it and you can't focus intently (lasts all day)?

One month today

I am officially one month smoke free. I started smoking when I was 16 years old and I always told myself I'll quit before 25. Well two months ago I turned 25 and got myself on chantix. A month later I quit smoking and haven't turned back yet. It wasn't easy by any means BUT it was easier than I had anticipated because of the chantix. Yes I've gained about 10 pounds, but it's worth it. If anyone is thinking about quitting or using chantix but is unsure about it, please feel free to ask me any questions. I was nervous about using chantix and it's side effects, but I couldn't have done it without this and the side effects were not bad at all. I did have vivid dreams which were mostly just awesome and not scary. I will tell you that I started my chantix and immediately went from a pack a day to half a pack. Then I went half again to 5 smokes a day and then finally to one a day before quitting. I would highly recommend this way of quitting as it went so much smoother than I expected. Just know that you CAN do this and don't be afraid to ask for help from your doctor or support from your friends family or just random people like me on Reddit.

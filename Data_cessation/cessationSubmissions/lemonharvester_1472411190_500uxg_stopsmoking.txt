Is it bad to substitute with an e-cig?

Quitting smoking cigarettes has been on my mind for quite some time. I'm almost ready to take the leap. I just downloaded the Livestrong Quit Smoking app. I plan to ween myself off, having an end date of 10/31. I smoke about a pack a day currently. I've been smoking regularly for 12 years. The longest I've gone without a cigarette since I started was about 3 weeks when I attempted to quit about 4 years ago. I used an e-cig during that time to fight through the intense cravings where I almost caved. Do you think it's a bad idea to substitute real cigarettes for an e-cig, just until I get over that awful hump? I'm not a huge fan of e-cigs so I won't be just puffing away on one all day because I stopped smoking cigarettes. I guess I would like to hear others' opinions who have gone through this in the past. I'm literally scared thinking ahead to my mornings without coffee and a cigarette.

Day 1: Allen carr's audio book in my car, going to finish it hopefully by the end of today

Just coming out of a cold that has lasted much longer than it should have anyway. So what better time to quit than when I'm already hacking up a lung?! The mental addiction is so frickin strong. 

I also do not want to be around anyone. Did anyone find any success / tips on being around/dealing with people minimally during their first few days? I kind of wish that I could knock myself out for a couple of days so that my body could recover and my mind would stop torturing me .

This is all a part of it. 
Aughhhh.

Words of wisdom for first few days?

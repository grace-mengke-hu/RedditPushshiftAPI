Dealing with a Minor Relapse

Howdy, everyone!

How do you deal with minor relapses? I was really tipsy this past weekend and I slipped up and had a few drags of someone's cigarette. 

I hadn't touched one before that and since then, but I just feel really down about it. Like I screwed up and wasted all of my effort.

Can anyone relate?

Thank you and best of luck to everyone,

A :-)

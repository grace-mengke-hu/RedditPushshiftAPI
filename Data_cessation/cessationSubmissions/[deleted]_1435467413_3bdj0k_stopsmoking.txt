Breaking this vicious cycle

I am done with smoking. There are so many mornings I wake up with a soar throat & chest, feeling guilty over the fact that I had a night out and then somehow smoked an entire pack of cigarettes (or more) within a time frame of just a few hours. I am a "binge smoker"; I do not care about not smoking for a few days, but when I do smoke, I light up one after the after. I don't know how many times I have reset my badge. There is this devil on my shoulders, and although I have vowed not to smoke, I'll simply buy a pack and smoke it all away when the weekend comes, as if I "deserve" it. It is as if I completely ignore the non-smoker in me every single time, because I just don't care at the moment (because I just had a rough day, because I just had a great day, because I am out with friends, because I can quit again tomorrow), but will always end up regretting it. How can I make it 'click' in me that I have really quit smoking? (Read Allen Carr, have the quit smoking app). I feel like I have reset my quitting date so many times that it has become insignificant and I cannot seem to get away from this vicious cycle. The first few days are not hard for me, but on the 4th or 5th day I'll give in and don't even care at the moment because I have proved that "it's not a problem for me not to smoke" - although it obviously is! Why do I keep fooling myself into this? Any tips or insights? Does anyone recognize this? Anyway, here's another day one! Breaking this vicious cycle!

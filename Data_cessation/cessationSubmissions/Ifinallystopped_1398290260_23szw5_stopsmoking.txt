Girlfriend and I stopped smoking, she's having a rougher time than I

This might be TMI but I've got to tell someone. I had been smoking for 5 years, I started as I'm a paramedic and my partner smoked so it really helped curb the stress between calls. I stopped at a little over a pack a day. My girlfriend had been smoking since she was 13, her parents are smokers so cigarettes were always available. She smokes the same as me but has been going at it for 12 years. 

We had a talk and we decided to quit due to wanting to have children in the future as well as prolong our lifespans. It has been a week so far and I didn't expect the moodiness to be this intense. I'm doing relatively okay, a bit more in my head than usual and terribly lethargic. She has been moody and insecure. We had a good night last night and I had to go home for work in the morning, I got a text from her saying we need a break from each other. Our relationship has never been rocky and she's never been one to hide anything from me, I'm just concerned and wondering if people really get withdrawals this badly, or could this be something else?

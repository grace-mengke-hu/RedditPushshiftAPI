Day 2. Canâ€™t stop picking up fights and crying.

It is now 4 pm. I was feeling amazing in the morning, thought that it will be easy this time. But for the last 4 hours I am on the verge of buying a packet.
I am having fights with my boyfriend over issues in the past and I am crying.
I am trying to walk, drink water, occupy myself with something but it just feels so stupid and I am so angry that I feel like only smoking could relieve me.
I am about to give up...

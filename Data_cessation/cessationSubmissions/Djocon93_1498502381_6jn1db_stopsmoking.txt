What to do when facing a trigger?

I've been completely nicotine free for a month now and most of my cravings have faded significantly but when people around me smoke or when I am in the car for a long ride I still crave a drag. I was wondering what some of you guys did to help lessen the effect of known triggers that you couldn't avoid. Thanks!

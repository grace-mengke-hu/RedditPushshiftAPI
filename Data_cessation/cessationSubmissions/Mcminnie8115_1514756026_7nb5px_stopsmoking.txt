Tonight is the Night

I have been a smoker for 4 years now. My friends have a joke with me that I have been trying to quit the entire time I’ve been smoking. My girlfriend doesn’t believe me whenever I say this is the last pack. I don’t blame her. I have tried quitting countless times

2017 was a rough year. A lot of realizations. Two deaths. An emotional roller coaster of drama after drama. So no more. I use to not care about the future. But today, today is the first chapter where I am excited. Excited for the hardships life will throw at me. Excited for the joy. Ready to move forward and put a new me to the world!

Wish me luck and I wish everyone else luck in the journey to becoming a non smoker. Good luck to all that have made it this far. To all the people trying this year. And I wish everyone a happy new year

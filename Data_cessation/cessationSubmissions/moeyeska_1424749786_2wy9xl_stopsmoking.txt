I can't handle this!

This is beginning to be to much my girlfriend doesn't want to talk to me! Are relationship is withering apart! I don't know how to convince her otherwise. She said she wants space but we have a four year old together so how is that going to work? I'm going to have to call and ask about him. And if I don't then I'm the bad guy. I just want to have a beer and smoke! Although I know I shouldn't! But the stress is killing me!! My friend just invited me over! And I'm my mind I should just have a beer. But that's how I started smoking in the first place and have been doing so for the past 11 years. I just decided to quit for the sake of our relationship but that's not even working. What should I do?! I need immediate help please....

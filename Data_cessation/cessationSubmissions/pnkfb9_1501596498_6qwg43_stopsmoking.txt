light cold + catarrh @ 80 days

Hi all guys! as the title says, I am at 80 days today and yesterday I started to feel like I have a very light cold, some sneezing, and I trhow up a lot of yellowish catarrh. I am questioning if it is the quitters flu ( but I know that it would been come the first couple weeks after quitting, and I am almost at 3 months), if it is a normal cold (but here in Italy is summer and usually I pick up a cold on winter, not on summer), or if my cilia's lungs are starting to cleanse themselves (I read somewhere that the lungs capacity to cleanse themselves starts at circa 3 months after quitting).

Anyone relates with this? 
Thank you! Have a nice day :)

Suggestions Welcome!

Hi everyone! My wife and I are quiting smoking. Admittedly she is doing way better at it then I. She hits 72 hours tonight and has cravings but has remained steadfast. I on the other hand have a very difficult time cutting cigarettes out cold turkey. I normally smoked about 6-7 a day. I cut back to 3 yesterday with hope that those would be my last. Sadly, I failed at that about 5 minutes ago. I started smoking in social circles but it quickly turned into a way to deal with stress. I failed today because I have a very high stress job and today was no different, I felt the cravings grow and finally gave in. I would love any suggestions or stories on how other people have dealt with stress after quitting. I already have an app that is helping however I'm worried it won't be enough.

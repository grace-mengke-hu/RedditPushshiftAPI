Quit smoking two weeks ago. Can't sleep, can't think.

Hello everyone.  I'm quitting at 35 years old.

I quit two weeks ago because of an abnormal x-ray that showed hyperinflated lungs.  At the time I had no issues with breathing or anything else.  I thought I was clear.  

Just days after quitting I started having issues.  A heat wave came and all hell broke loose:  I can't sleep more than 2 hours a night.  I've lost 6 pounds (not a good thing when you're underweight anyway).  I have no appetite, can't think clearly.  I feel like I'm going to fall over after walking for a few minutes.  I have a hard time carrying on a conversation.

I've been to ER and Urgent Care 6 times in two weeks.  They haven't seen anything wrong.  I lucked out and got a spirography Pulmonary Function Test after only 6 days, and it came out fine.  Supposedly no COPD.  

My own walk test has my blood oxygen level dropping to 94-92 when taking a walk.  After that walk I feel completely drained and brain dead for a few hours.

Can anyone shed some light on what's going on with me?  I'm going to lose my mind, health and probably my job if this doesn't improve soon.

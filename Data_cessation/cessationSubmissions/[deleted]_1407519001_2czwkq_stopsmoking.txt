Quit zits - did anyone get them?

I've had several attempts at quitting, and each time I get terrible breakouts all over my face with some really deep pimples. I've never managed to quit for longer than a month, so I don't know how long these last. I'm now qutting cigs again, and after only 4 days I already notice 2 red spots appearing near my nose. Has anyone had any experience with this? How long did this last? Is there a good treatment for these spots?

Thanks in advance!

Can I be frank?

I see everyone complaining about the withdrawals, how they want a smoke so bad, how life is a living hell. I was thinking about quitting myself, and honestly, just thinking about quitting made me anxious and depressed. Two hours without a smoke and I want to murder someone. Sure I smell like cigarettes, and I can't breathe as well as I could, and I may die of some smoking related ailment, but all of that sounds so much better than having to quit and deal with all those things. Mind you, I have a few mental illness' that I am not properly medicated for, but at least I can act somewhat normal after a few puffs. Why quit?

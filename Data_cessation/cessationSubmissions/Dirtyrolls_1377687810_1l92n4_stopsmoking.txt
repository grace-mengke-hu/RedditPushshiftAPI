Switched to an electronic cigarette but I'm feeling really depressed and still craving cigarettes.

Did anyone else get really depressed when they switched to an electronic cigarette?


I bought a volcano PV and I'm still craving cigarettes. I'm also feeling really depressed, moody and lethargic. It's not as bad as going cold turkey but I've never quit for this long before; usually I get up to day 3 and then I can't handle it. How long does this last? What can I do?

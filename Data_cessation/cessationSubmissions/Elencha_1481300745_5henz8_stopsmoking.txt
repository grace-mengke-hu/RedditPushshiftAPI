22ish Hours in, Cold Turkey

So. this is kinda weird. I'm not really having any symptoms except anxiety. Just a mild, creeping, breath-holding anxiety sort of like I get when I'm low on cigarettes and trying to stretch them until I can afford another pack. I haven't got any of the irritability I'm supposed to get. Although I have gotten the part where my mind gives me nine thousand reasons I should go get a pack of cigarettes.

Anyway, I figured checking in over here would be a good idea for accountability and support, so... hi! 

Edit: Did anyone else experience rather serious digestive issues?

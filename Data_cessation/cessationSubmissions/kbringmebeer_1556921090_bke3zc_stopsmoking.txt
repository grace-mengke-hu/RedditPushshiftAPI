Day 2 vape withdrawal advice needed

Ive been vaping 3mg for about a year with the occasional cigarette here and there. Shit’s been really rough the past year with family issues and the ending of a four year relationship with the person I thought was the love of my life. My vape was a little crutch to get me through everything when I didn’t have much motivation to live. Things have gotten better and I’m healing but knew I needed to quit the vape because even though it’s not AS bad as cigs, inhaling so much nicotine every day isn’t healthy. Id consider myself a chain vaper and nursed it pretty much any time I had the opportunity. My last hit was 2 nights ago before bed. Yesterday and all of last night I felt super restless, confused and out of it. Started developing severe cold like symptoms, highly congested, bad cough, sore throat, stuffed nose, no energy and chills. Is this normal to feel this bad after quitting? I was under the impression from my research some irritability and a headache would be expected but I’m absolutely floored and can only lay in bed. Any advice on how to feel better? I completely threw out my vape and my cigs so I’m not going to relapse, I don’t even crave it if that is what has made me feel this sick. Thank you so much in advance

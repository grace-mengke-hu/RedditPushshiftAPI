Quit smoking, started vaping

After a debaucherous night of drinking and excessive smoking at a friends bachelor party last Saturday I had become disgusted with myself because I had smoked an entire pack in one night. The following day I was out of cigs and a friend told me he had discovered an e-cig shop that had recently opened in my town. Since I thought ecigs were banned in Canada I was actually very excited to go ahead and partake in picking one up.

It is now Friday and the last cig I smoked was Monday morning, vaping really helps and plus I no longer stink and feel like crap. Cravings haven't drastically subsided but at least I'm smoking something! I suggest some of you give it a shot if you're not ready to go cold turkey.

I failed.

25 years smoking a pack a day. I quit for 6 months using a vape. I had never stayed off the cancer sticks for so long and I tried so many times lasting a max of a week. I started smoking again last month for no particular reason and I am smoking more than I did before - up to almost 2 packs a day over the last week. I feel terrible physically and I am embarrassed and ashamed that I didn't stay off them. Not one person with the exception of my boss, was encouraging when I was off them. Now friends and family are like 'well we knew you would end up smoking again'. I give up giving up...
To all of you that are giving up - stay strong.

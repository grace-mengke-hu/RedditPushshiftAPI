Cravings. How do you handle them?

Hey all. I'm just a few days in. I quit because I just didn't feel like smoking anymore. It was an unwelcome inconvenience. 

So far so good. But it's only been a week. After reading a few posts, I've noticed people struggling around the 2 week mark and that's already giving me mild anxiety. 

This is how I've managed my cravings thus far:

1. Taking a bath/shower and using delicious smelling bodywash, lotions and perfume. Basically relishing my fresh smelling skin, hair and teeth. 

2. Exercising! I've committed to an 8 week workout plan which so far has helped me tremendously. I think because I'm working towards something. Gives me a purpose and a healthy distraction.

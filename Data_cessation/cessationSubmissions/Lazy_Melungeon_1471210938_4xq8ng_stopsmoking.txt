How I Quit

I smoked on and off for 30 years. My last cigarette was on October 31st, 2007.

I quit because I am a nurse practitioner and a diabetic, overweight asthmatic. 

I could no longer stand the thought of how very stupid my addiction was, and how I was setting myself up for prolonged, expensive disability.

I quit with several crutches: 

1. I cut drinking straws to the size of cigarettes and put them in my last pack. I carried that pack around and took out straws, pretending to smoke them. 

2. I chewed nicotine gum while smoking my straws.

3. I had my last cig on a special date (Halloween) so I could remember the date and count how many months/years since I had kicked the habit.

I kept using the gum for about 2 years. It helped a lot.

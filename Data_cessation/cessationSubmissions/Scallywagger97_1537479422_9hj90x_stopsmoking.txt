Starting to quit tobacco &amp; cannabis bong smoking NOW

So it's been about 5 years since i started bong smoking; mixing pouch tobacco with my cannabis, about a 50/50 ratio. I smoke out of a rather large bowl, inhaling the whole thing in one go, (about 1/3 of a rolled cigarette). This replaces the sensation of having a cigarette for me, It's very common over here in Australia to do so. I've tried going cold turkey, but i don't think I've tried hard enough to really get past that first initial month.

I've been meaning to take up Rock Climbing recently &amp; I just signed up for a 10 week beginners course. I hope this will distract me from some of the future cravings I'll have. I also believe that becoming fit again will push me to not only become healthier, but also help build the motivation i need to help actually quit. I'm confident &amp; ready.

If there's anyone else that is or was in the same boat as i'm in right now, any advice is greatly appreciated!

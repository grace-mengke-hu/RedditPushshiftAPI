3 days and a big cycle ride complete

I had my last cigarettes on Sunday and have had Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday cold turkey. I have tried to quit 2 times before and managed 1 week first time, 2 weeks second time and I'm hoping I might be able to stay strong for good this third time but it's early days. I have just completed a massive cycle ride that has cleared a good amount of phlegm from my lungs and made me realise how much I have been clogging my body up and looking at myself in the mirror and realising I am not the athlete I once was.  

My first quit was definitely the hardest so far, it was after 5 years of about 5-15 cigarettes a day and felt like agony. I was gassy, headaches, dreaming about smoking, waking up in cold sweats, white as a sheet, really unhappy and felt like I was trapped forever and I allowed myself to protect my sanity by returning to the habit. My second quit which lasted 2 weeks was a lot easier (admittedly it was when I went on holiday which always helps) but I felt myself feeling pangs and pains from the quit but genuinely feeling pretty strong. Unfortunately when I got home after the 2 weeks I went to a music night and couldn't resist picking them back up again. Another month down the line and this third quit has felt easier than both the others so far. I have got to a stage where I understand the process of this early stage and am finding it easier to power through. I think it's all moving in the right direction. Hope this provides information to someone :) bless

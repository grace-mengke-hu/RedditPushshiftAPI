Pregnant Mothers Who Smoke.

The purpose of this is to ask a question I've been wondering for a while.

While my mother was pregnant with me, she was roughly a 30 a day smoker. Aside from being a small baby when born, this had no noticeable effect on me, thank God.

What I was wondering is basically if a woman snokes while pregnant, it's possible for the baby to become addicted and crave nicotine after being born, BUT, if a woman smokes while pregnant and gives birth and the child grows up, is that said baby more likely to become accustomed to nicotine when he/she starts smoking due to the absorption as a fetus?

Random question I know, I'm just curious. Maybe fetus' brains are rewired to obtain addictive tendencies to cigarettes.

almost relapsed after 4 months

hi

i'm following Game of Thrones like 5 years ago.
one of my really favorite show and i watched it always together with my... tobacco. new series started just now, and i delayed to watch it, just because i was afraid i wouldn't be able to handle it "alone". tonight i couldn't wait anymore and i choose the easy way. i promised myself i will smoke only during the show (that's really risky, most likely broken promise) and keep it in secret, cause i didn't want to cause disappointment around me.

my partner is still a smoker, so there is tobacco in the house, but as i opened the box, there was only one left in there. 

if i smoke that or i open a new box, that will be surely noticeable. so then i decided i go out to buy one. i looked down on the ground the whole way, and i was thinking what the fuck am i doing, but i just didn't care.

as i got there, there was not my kind of cigarette, and then the vending machine was working only limited day time (it was always 24/7 before). 

i couldn't do anything, just laughing that somebody really don't want me to do it and let it go for now.

but i'm not sure in myself, i'm not sure what i will do tomorrow. seems like i lost the motivation to keep up the fight!?

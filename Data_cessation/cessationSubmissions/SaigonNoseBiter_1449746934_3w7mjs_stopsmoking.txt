Day 1.

Ive been living in Saigon, Vietnam.  You can smoke literally everywhere here.  Packs cost $1.  These means that pretty much all my friends smoke.  I quit for 6 months 2 different times in the past 3 years.  Read Allen Carr - it worked, then it didnt.  Now it's time.  Day one.  Rough day so far, but my run had my lung BURNING and i know I don't want those little butt-suckers anymore.  I'm free of something bad this time, instead of losing something I love.  This little caveat in perspective might just be the difference.  Wish me luck!

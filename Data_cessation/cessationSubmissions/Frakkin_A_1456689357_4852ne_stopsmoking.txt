Three weeks = crazy depression and restlessness

Hey guys and gals,

I've been so busy, I am just realizing i hit three weeks tomorrow! 

That said, the past week has been a real struggle. I already deal with depression, and am on antidepressants, but not smoking is making it SO much worse. Ever since day one the depression is gradually growing in strength. Now it is putting strain on my relationship - I got engaged about a month before quitting - and this elongated period of sadness is not helping us at all. My fianc√© is supportive, but doesn't deserve to be treated like I've been treating him.

Anywho, my brain is telling me - keep in mind I'm strictly an e-cig user, not tobacco - to just go back on nicotine and then quit again under the supervision of a therapist. Is that the addiction talking, or is that actually a logical thing going on? I can't tell, lol.

Thanks, all. Le sigh.

200 or so days and I need help.

Hey guys..

Its been awhile since I have posted or commented here. Honestly it has been so long since I have felt a serious craving that I thought I was out of the thick of things. However, right now, I dont know if I can do it. I am feeling really down and have been drinking and all I can think about is going next door to the Marathon and picking up a pack. I need your help homies... All I want to do is go across the street and smoke a cig. Its been so long tooo.. I cant ruin this now.

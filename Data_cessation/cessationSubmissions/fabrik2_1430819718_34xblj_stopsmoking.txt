Ten days in, where is the pay off?

So I'm 10 days into my first real attempt to quit smoking (after about 5 years smoking 1.5 packs a week), and I'm not getting any apparent positive benefits from quitting, other than that my boyfriend is super happy with me and I have a bit more cash on hand. Meanwhile, I have cravings and trouble processing stress.

At the moment, I don't really see the point of quitting 100 percent. Why can't I smoke a couple times a week? Smoking is fun...

If anyone has any motivating words to help me see the point of this, I would appreciate it.

The main thing motivating me right now is the desire not to disappoint or lie to my boyfriend. This doesn't seem like a sustainable situation.

After my Dad's heart attack we both threw away our cigarettes.

On June 26th my dad suffered a heart attack while he was at a truck stop. When he got to the hospital they put a stent in his heart. He later told me that right before they put the stent in place he was "fading out." His heart beat was 30 bpm. The doctor told us the next day that if he had waited another hour he would have been dead.

When he got released we both threw away our cigarettes in the hospital parking lot. He threw away a brand new unwrapped pack. I threw away half of one. He's been smoking for the past 40 years and I have been for 4 years. It will be tough but this was a huge wake up call for both of us.

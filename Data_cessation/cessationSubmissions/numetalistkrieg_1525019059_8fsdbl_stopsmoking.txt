First time ever having a smoking nightmare/dream.

I can't remember all the details of it, other than apparently I was chain smoking multiple cigarettes at once. I woke up in a panic state, actually thinking that I'd just smoked. It actually took a moment to process that it's been two days (badge reset pending.)

I'm assuming this is common? Tobacco isn't the first thing I've quit, so I know anxiety dreams aren't unusual.

It's been a little over 48 hours since my last cigarette. I'm definitely feeling withdrawal peaking a bit. I know it'll come down within a day or two. Ain't no big deal. Not going to let anxiety dictate my actions. Cravings are what they are. Addiction can get bent. I'm not smoking today.

120 days smoke free!

I have been a non smoker officially for 120 days. Life is so different for me now I can't imagine going back to smoking! I was a smoker for 12 years and can't believe I let it consume so much of my life. 

I know that everyone talks about Allen Carr's book and that is how I quit smoking also! I read that book, smoked my last cigarette and haven't smoked since. I can't praise the book enough for how much it changed my life. 

I just wanted to share it is possible to quit smoking even if you think it is impossible, because I thought I would smoke for the rest of my life.

My progress in cutting out the cancer sticks!

Hey all, I've been a smoker for a while now, and have been struggling to quit the past 6 years. In fact, the longest I've gone, in the past 6 years, without a cigarette was 10 days. 

I would buy the "last" pack, make a declaration to stop and throw away the pack. Then like clockwork, I would find myself standing at a liquor store counter shamefully asking for a new pack. 

Well, I'm proud to say that this time around I made it an entire month without lighting up! I get urges, sure, but instead of acting on it - I just visualize myself feeling like shit and having the nasty breath and fingers. 

Anyway, I don't mean to be boastful, but I just wanted to share my progress. To track my days, I've been using the Productive app. 

For those who want to see the progress. Circles mean  I didn't smoke, lines mean I failed.

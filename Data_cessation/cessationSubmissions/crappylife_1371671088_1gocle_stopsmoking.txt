Starting a new job

im stressing out.  not so much a new job but a different department.  I've worked there b4 and i hate it.  I dont hate the job,  i just hate the people.  I smoked like a train last summer.  I only work there on summers.  I feel like smoking more than very.  I really dont want to work there but i got nothing else and i need the money.  Shit shit shit since i quit this is probably the worse urge i've had and i feel like giving in.

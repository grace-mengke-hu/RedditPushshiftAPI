Believe it and it will happen.

Today is one year without smoking. This sub, supportive friends and willpower got me here after 30 years of smoking anywhere from a half pack to some times as much as 2 packs per day. I tried many times to quit and it never stuck. This time it did. You can make it stick too. Just. Keep. Trying. Never give up!

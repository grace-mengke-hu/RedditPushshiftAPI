DAE feel like this sub is a bit cultish with Allen Carr's The Easy Way

There must be thousands of plans and books and methods for quitting smoking. On this sub it seems like the only thing ever mentioned is Allen Carr's the Easy Way. It is mentioned so much here that I often wonder if this sub is infiltrated by someone just trying to sell books through alternate accounts. Or perhaps it's just that it's good and that this sub has made a community and this particular community just favors this. Maybe it's a passing fad. Maybe it's a cult. Did you ever wonder if your life was the Truman show and you could never even trust anyone if they told you it wasn't? I watched the video on Youtube with young Theon Greyjoy twice and I thought it was good and helpful. But this fandom/ cult/ sales pitch here is too much.  Thoughts?

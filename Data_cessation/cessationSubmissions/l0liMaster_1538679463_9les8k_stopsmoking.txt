Started vaping again and smoking much less, but still hard to breathe/tightness in lungs

Hey guys.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been smoking for about 4 years now, on and off but mostly on. I smoke about a pack every 4-5 days.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently (as of September) I decided to try the JUUL, and try and smoke much less. It worked really well in terms of actually being my first vape experience where I wasn't craving a cigarette afterwards. I went a few weeks without smoking at all, and it was great.

&amp;#x200B;

My only issue was that even though I wasn't smoking, it was still hard to breathe, and in fact I would say that it actually got worse. I feel winded going up flights of stairs (only mildly so while I was smoking), and even during regular physical activity I'm just finding myself way more out of breath all the time. Nothing else in my lifestyle has changed (regular weight lifting, eating habits normal, sleep is normal, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

Has any one else experienced continued/worsened lung conditions while vaping? 

I'm also trying to figure out if it is the smoke/tar/carbon monoxide in cigarettes that make it hard to breathe, or if it is actually just the nicotine. The JUUL delivers a lot of nicotine compared to other vapes, and I'm wondering if perhaps things like shortage of breath are actually linked to nicotine, and not the smoke itself?

Let me know what you guys think.

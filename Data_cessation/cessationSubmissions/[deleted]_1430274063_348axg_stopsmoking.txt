Hid smoking from the people who love me.

Embarassed to say i even started smoking with my parents constantly telling me not to do it growing up (they dont smoke). Ive taken many breaks but everytime i came back to the habit it dug its claws in deeper. Ive been weening from a pack a day, down to one a day (suffered ugly mood swings w/o them). I know its a bad way to quit, thats why today im calling it quits. I truly want to see myself saving money and am scared to be judged by loved ones, if they were to ever find out.

Wish me luck,
Not actually a dad.

Edit: totally babbled without writing what i wanted to.. Last week i witnessed my grandfather a smoker for 20 years or so die from lung cancer. He even quit years before he knew of the complications he had recieved from the darts. It really opened my eyes and made me realize i could be doing lasting damages even after a couple years of smoking.

Itching feeling in lungs after quitting

I quit 13 days ago and my lungs have started to have an itchy feeling over the past few days.  I know that my lungs are working to clear out all of the tar but this feeling seems weird.  It's like an itch that I would feel on my skin.  Has anyone else experienced this after quitting?

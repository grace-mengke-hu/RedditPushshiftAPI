Fell off, 2nd time much harder

I went a month cold turkey.  Felt great.  Healthy, energized, etc.  But then.  

It started with one, hanging out with a friend who didn't know I quit, she'd already lit up and offered me one.  I told her I wasn't smoking anymore, but would have one anyway.  It was just us, I didn't want to make her feel uncomfortable.  I honestly wasn't even craving it, I gave in for social pressure, I guess.  I did not enjoy it, but the hooks were back in.  

I'm still not up to where I was smoking.  I can go a few days without, but stress triggers, money trouble (roommate is a month+ behind on rent to me), and social drinking always bring me back in.  

Anyone else had this trouble on a second attempt?  Or have any advice for starting again?

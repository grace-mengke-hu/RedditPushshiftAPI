A Reason A Day

I'm going to try this new exercise. I'm four days smoke-free and feeling pretty good. My sleeping is still off but my energy level is definitely higher, my breathing feeling better and I think of my sense of smell is returning. 

But there's this nagging voice that says "you've made it this far before and failed then...it's just a matter of time." "Once an addict, always an addict." 

So this is my new fun method of quelling that voice. For each day I go without a cigarette, I'm going to name off a reason to stay quit. It could be massive (like I want to be able to chase my grandkids without towing an oxygen machine) or little (I bought an ice cream cone with money I would have bought cigarettes with.) But each day I will find a new reason to stay quit.

I hope you'll join me! Here's my catch up to today. 

Day 1: Easier to conceive (husband and I are officially trying to have a baby)
Day 2: Actually tasting the food I love to cook. 
Day 3: Climbing stairs without huffing and puffing. 

And todays: 
Day 4: Not standing in the heat/cold to suck down leaves and paper.

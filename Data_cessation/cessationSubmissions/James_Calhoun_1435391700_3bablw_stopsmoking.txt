How long did it take for you when the mood-swings and depression subsided?

Since I've quit smoking my mood is instable as fuck. I have days I'm happy and days (like today) I feel miserable for no particular reason. I read on the Internet that this is a common withdrawal symptom, so I wondered howlong it took for you guys for these symptoms to subside? Thanks!

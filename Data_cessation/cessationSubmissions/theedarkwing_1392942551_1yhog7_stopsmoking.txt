After 16 years I am past one week

After 16 years with with a pack a day I finally made it over a week after a month  of fighting.  I feel great. I  hope since I have been fighting so hard month that my cravings have really dropped off. I have past the week mark three years ago but couldn't make it past a month. This time I cant wait to pass a month. This time feels extremely different.   Thanks for listening.  Also my gf is having a hard time quitting any suggestions for how I can help motivate her or help support her? Especially since we currently live with a couple inconsiderate smokers who dont care if your trying to quit?

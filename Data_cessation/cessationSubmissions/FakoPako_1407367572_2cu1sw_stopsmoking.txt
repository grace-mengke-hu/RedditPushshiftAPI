Uhhh...strong cravings

Started to gill my lunch for tomorrow and got this insanely strong urge to smoke. I would usually smoke when I would wait for the grill to heat up. I would sit in my chair, play on my phone and light one up. 

It was rough one. Its gone now though. Immediately thought about if I smoked one now, almost 3 days in the trash, I would smell like shit again and basically be back yo square one.

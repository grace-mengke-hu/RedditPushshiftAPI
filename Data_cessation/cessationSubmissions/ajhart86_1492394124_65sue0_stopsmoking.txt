What was your breaking point?

I guess it was a few things for me.

I pulled a muscle around my ribs from coughing so much. I realized how much money I was spending on cigarettes. And I also realized that any sort of novelty or enjoyment I got out of smoking cigarettes was gone. It had become as routine as eating and sleeping.

I decided to finish the last few cigarettes I had and to start my quit the next day. I wasted $50 on a box of Nicorette gum that I only used for the first day. I'm on Day 26 and I just hope I never get complacent enough again to start the habit again.

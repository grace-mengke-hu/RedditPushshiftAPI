Does anyone else feel less confident when not on nicotine?

Everytime I quit cigs/nicotine gum, I became a LOT more anxious, and my ability to socialize goes out the window. I perform so much better on work, on dates, and just with people in general when I'm on Nicotine.

I'm currently one week into quitting and I really want that feeling back, but I'm not sure if it's worth it. Will this get better?

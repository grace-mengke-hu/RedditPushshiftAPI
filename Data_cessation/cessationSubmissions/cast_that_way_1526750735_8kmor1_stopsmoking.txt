I just discovered this subreddit. It's 2 months today, I'm kicking myself in the head for not having quit earlier.

I went from 15 a day to quitting cold turkey. I had promised my wife that when a certain event would take place I would quit once and for all.

I received an email confirming that the event had just happened, I was smoking. I threw the cig away mid-smoke and never looked back.

I just wanted to get this off my chest, thanks for listening 😁

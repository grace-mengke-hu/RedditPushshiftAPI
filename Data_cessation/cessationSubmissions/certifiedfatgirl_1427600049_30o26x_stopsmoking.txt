First day. This is gonna suck lol.

I'm 20 years old, been smoking for about 2 years now and I've finally decided to stop. I woke up this morning, super hungover, took a couple drags off my morning CIG, almost throw up lol, and threw my nearly full pack in the garbage. I'm simply here looking for words of motivation to keep strong. My coworkers who have quit say the first few days are the worst in terms of the withdrawals but it gets easier. I don't have a quitting buddy so I came here instead. Simply looking for words of motivation or humor over the next few days. My lungs are on fire, but it's gonna be worth it in the end :D

Im fucking done

For good this time.  I am 19, better to quit earlier than later.

I have never been a hardcore smoker, unless i am drunk or with people. which i have been doing a lot lately. So Im fucking quitting this bullshit now.

Im done with this disgusting habit, though i only do it socially, im sick of the feeling i get in my lungs. I already quit weed for good, so lets see how this goes.

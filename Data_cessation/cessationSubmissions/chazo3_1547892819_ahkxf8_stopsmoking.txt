Sudden cravings after years of not smoking

So i smoked as a young teen, like 12-15yo. I've had 2 cigarettes in the past 7years and didn't find it hard to quit when i was younger.

But now im suddenly craving cigarettes again, I dont even know anyone who smokes. I've always liked the smell of cigarette smoke but I've never had that gut feeling of really needing a smoke until now. Any good ways to make the craving go away? Chewing gum hasn't really worked so far

Thanks!

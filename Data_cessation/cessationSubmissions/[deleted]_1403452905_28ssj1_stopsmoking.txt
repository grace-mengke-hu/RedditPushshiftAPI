Two Weeks Wow!

I went cold turkey and I think that is the way to do it. I was expecting to feel horrible but it was so much easier than I thought. I think it has to do with me being 100% done with smoking. There was no internal battle of “do I really want to do this right now.” The cravings come but I always know they will pass. It still find myself having the urge to go outside and pace around like I did when I was smoking. Last night I put on a jacket I hadn’t worn in some time and it reeked on cigarettes. I can’t believe I went out smelling like that. I’m definitely going to keep it up.

Good luck to everybody.

Day two, I don't want to smoke and everything sucks

I feel like I don't go more than 5 minutes without thinking about it.  Last night I woke up at least three times.  This morning I went on a service call and it was very frustrating, when I finished up I got in the car and starting CRYING.  I really don't want to smoke, I keep telling my self this is temporary and I'll feel better in a few days, right?

Parents who smoke

So the other day I drove my mom to the doctor and on the way back we passed in front of a vape shop. On the spot, I stopped, parked and told her we should go check it out.

She is now equipped with an ecig and has not smoked a real cigarette in about 10 days. She is in love with it and cannot see herself going back to real cigs.

I feel a little hypocritical, because I am not really a big advocate of ecigs. I think the best possible alternative is being free of addiction. However, with my mom, who is a closet smoker (maybe that's where I got it) and has been smoking on and off for probably 50 years, I was starting to get very concerned about her health, which thankfully has not been affected (yet) by smoking related illnesses.

I have given her the Allen Carr book which has remained unread to date; I have been an example for the past year +; she has tried patches and lozenges, and always goes back to smoking. With ecigs, it's different. I think whether or not she reduces to 0mg, it's still a million times better than smoking.

Thankfully, she is open minded and curious enough to try something new and different. I think getting her involved in the purchasing, while myself having a little knowledge, helped tremendously with the buy in.

It is opening up her mind and breaking the vicious circle, and that is already a huge step forward. While it may not be for everyone, but for those of you with aging parents who are still smoking, this may be a viable route to take.

As a side note, I was there with her the whole time (we spent an hour at the store, which had just opened 2 weeks prior) while she tried the different flavours and whatnot and I was not even tempted once. The testers where nicotine free but I really had zero interest. Personally, I think it looks ridiculous but I know if I were still addicted I'd think differently.

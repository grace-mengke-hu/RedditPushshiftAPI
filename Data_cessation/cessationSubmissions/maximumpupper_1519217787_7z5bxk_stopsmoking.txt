My best friend quit smoking last night, any tips for being supportive in the early days/weeks?

This is (I think?) the 2nd time my best friend has chosen to quit smoking. I’m very proud of him for making the choice to quit again and want to have his back through this.

I have never been a smoker and nobody I’m close with, other than him, has ever quit smoking, so I don’t really have any experience with helping someone through it. From what I’ve seen online there’s the obvious “be supportive, don’t take things personally, don’t be a dick.” 

From your experience quitting, is there anything you wish your friends had said/done to make the transition easier?

Thanks so much!!

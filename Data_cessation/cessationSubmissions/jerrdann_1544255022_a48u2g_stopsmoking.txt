Today is the day.

I just came inside from having a cigarette. I finally want to quit. I’ve been smoking on and off for about 4 years, and until now, I haven’t really wanted to. 

My family has a lot of smokers, and smoker related health problems. My doctor says I’m still healthy, I want out while I still can. Wish me luck.

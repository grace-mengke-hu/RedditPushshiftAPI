I made a stupid mistake a year ago, and I am doing something about it now!

Last year a few months before turning 18 I started smoking, before that I always said that I would never smoke, because it is nothing but bad, but friends, parties and school changed that. Now after a year I want to fix my mistake, I tried once, but due to the lack of support I started again, this subreddit has shown me that it is possible, and has given me enough motivation to go through with it! Thank you guys.

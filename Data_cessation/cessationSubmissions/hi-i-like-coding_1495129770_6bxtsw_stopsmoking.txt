Help - trying to get off nicotine (vaping)

Hi, I was wondering if anyone had any advice for quitting vaping. A few weeks ago I started smoking, then I decided I might as well get a vape. So now I'm vaping, but I want to get off nicotine... it's still incredibly addicting, but I want to get off of it.

I ordered some step 3 nicoderm, which is the lowest dose. Hoping that helps.

One problem I have is, I'll vape and vape and vape, and then I'll feel all shitty afterward from the nicotine. So I'm trying to not vape unless I'm really needing it.

I ultimately want to get off of this stuff asap. Any tips appreciated.

For those who question a quitter's Willpower

Why is it that most people think someone either has "all" the willpower or they have "no" willpower? When it comes to the addiction to cigarettes or maybe something more explicit, willpower is something someone will need to defeat the "demon" that is burdening them. 

I just wanted to say that if you slip up, that does NOT mean you have "no willpower", it does not make you weak, it does not make you a loser, it does not make you a hypocrite...it makes you HUMAN. 

Willpower is in NO sense an absolute. It takes careful planning a preparation for a successful quit. It may take many, many tries. But the ends justify the means and the experiences from your failures will guide you to success at another time. 

It takes willpower to decide to stop smoking. It takes willpower to place those patches on yourself or chew the gum. It takes willpower to look at your smoking family/friends and say "no." It takes willpower to avoid buying a pack at the gas station. It takes willpower to avoid the situations that may cause you to smoke. 

You have willpower and you always will. If you slip up, you did not lose it. It didn't disappear and it didn't betray you. You did not "lose." It only lost its footing. Find it, pick it up, dust it off, and place it where it belongs. 

If someone in your life tries to tell you that you have no willpower for smoking or relapsing...they are wrong. What you are doing, or did, takes courage, takes sacrifice, and is much harder than those people tend to realize. Don't listen to them. Ignore their rolling eyes and their quips about your "quit record." Ignore the smoke they may try to blow near you, ignore the childish taunts and impressions. YOU have willpower. They do too. They just haven't picked theirs up from the ground yet.

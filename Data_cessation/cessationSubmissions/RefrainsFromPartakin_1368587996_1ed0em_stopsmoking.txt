3 days down!

Me and one of my best friends had finished our packs Saturday night, and the plan was to get e-cigs Sunday. I woke up a few hours before he did, smoked a Black clove. Smoked half a cigarette with my friend about an hour and a half later (11am). 

We got the e-cigs at 2pm. Haven't touched a cigarette since. My lungs feel awesome (aside from the coughing up crap), I can start to smell again...

I dunno. I feel good. I feel like I'm cheating, because I haven't quit nicotine, and that I'm just being a pussy, but you know what? Fuck you, cigarette addicted brain. I don't know if I'll smoke another cigarette again.

On the bus home from work, a guy sat down in front of me. Fuckin' reeked of smoke. Did I used to smell like that? How did people stand me? 

Good vibes to everyone :) I'm enjoying not being broke, because I would have spent the last of my money on cigarettes, instead of food and transportation, like I should be (and am).

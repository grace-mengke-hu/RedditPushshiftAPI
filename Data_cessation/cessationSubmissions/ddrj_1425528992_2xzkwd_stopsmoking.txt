Has anyone noticed any weird side effects from quitting?

I've been coughing up a lot of phlegm/mucus (clear whitish color) that's coming from my chest and not nose after I stopped smoking. Also, I've been eating a lot more. I'm a male. I don't think my hormones could've changed from not smoking causing me to eat. And what's up with the phlegm? Anyone  experienced this before when they quit?

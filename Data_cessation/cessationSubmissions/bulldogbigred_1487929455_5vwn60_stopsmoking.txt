First-timer here. I just caved in and had my first cigarette in 4 days...

I am 21 and have been smoking for about 2 years. I attribute the fact that I stated smoking when I studied abroad a semester in Europe and EVERYONE smokes there and that's how I got hooked. My dad smokes as well so that doesn't help when I'm around visiting. 

I did good these past four days because I just started a plan to try to exercise and lose weight and I know smoking and exercising don't go hand-in-hand. But god damn I just caved in and had 5 cigarettes today. 

I do have nicotine gum so maybe I should just try that when I get the next urge

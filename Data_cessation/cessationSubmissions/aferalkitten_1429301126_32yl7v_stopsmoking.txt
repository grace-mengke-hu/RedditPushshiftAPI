Almost a month

I was outside of my work taking a vape break browsing on my phone and these two kids were riding scooters around. One of them stops and looks at me curiously and says, "Aren't you too young to be smoking?" (I'm 19 smoker since about 10) I said "You are absolutely right and that's why I quit smoking about a month ago". Of course he asked me about the I-Stick50W I have and I explained the differences in smoking and vaping. I also made sure to reinforce the point to not start. It feels great coming on a month I have also started to lose weight because I can jog/run without my chest and heart hurting. /r/ImProof

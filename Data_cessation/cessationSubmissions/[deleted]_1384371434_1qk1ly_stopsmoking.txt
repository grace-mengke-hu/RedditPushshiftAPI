Finally going to give quitting a whirl. And my wife is going on this journey with me.

Today is my first day trying out nicotine patches. 

I'm not a big believer in AA mentality, or group management of addiction, so it feels strange to subscribe to this sub. But, i do realize that i reddit... alot. And that having my front page more frequently filled with reminders as to why I'm quitting will be helpful.

I've been a smoker since I was thirteen, the amount steadily rose every day til i got to the point where i was smoking 2+ packs a day. I realized this was excessive a couple years ago and began to attempt to taper off, it dawned on me that i was consuming more nicotine every day than is required to kill an adult human being. Slowly just kept cutting down my intake to the point that at the beginning of this year it was a one pack a day problem, and more recently a half a pack a day thing.

Three days from now is my twenty third birthday and i feel ten years has been a bit to long and it is time to end the vice grip big tobacco has had on my lungs and my wallet.

To say i do not enjoy smoking would be a lie. But i am done with being addicted, i have cut out every other major addiction i have had in my life and i fully admit that this one is the hardest to quit so far. But i am hopeful.

My wife is giving the attempt to quit with me, i am hopeful. I care a lot about that woman. 

I'm sure I'll be back soon enough here with stories. Hopefully we don't kill eachother in our quest for health.

Good luck to everyone else out there also giving this a whirl.

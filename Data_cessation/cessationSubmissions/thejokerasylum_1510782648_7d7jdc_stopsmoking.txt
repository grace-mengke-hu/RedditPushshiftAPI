Any long time vape users here? Need some information!

Been a smoker for past 10 years. Tried quitting cold turkey many times but couldn't. I m thinking of using vape with 6mg liquid. I heard it much easier that way and vape is much less harmful. Saw a few videos on YouTube, basically comparison videos between cigarette and vaping.

And omg, cigarettes are gross. Anyways my question is that do vape users noticed health improvement after switching from cigarettes to vape? 

Thanks all in advance.

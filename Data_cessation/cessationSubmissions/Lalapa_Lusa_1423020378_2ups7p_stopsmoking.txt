My boyfriend is trying to quit smoking, I'd like help.

My boyfriend is on day five of going cold turkey. He's tried to quit in the past and it never really took, patches, the e-cigarette, and so on.

I'm not sure what I can do to help him aside from be supportive, is there anything more I can do action-wise, or verbally, for him?

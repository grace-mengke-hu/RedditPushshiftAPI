Almost ready

I’ve been having ongoing health issues (bad skin, painful) that I seem! To be on top of now, my husband and I both quit about a year and a half ago, he has managed to stay quit and I’m so proud, also feel very guilty that I couldn’t stay quit, I managed 2 months and reversed all the good work, I feel like I could take this new battle on again, now that I have seemingly concurred my skin issues. I want to feel healthy and happy again, not sure when il take the plunge, I think I’m mostly waiting to see if my skin stays this way behaving itself

NRT Question

Hey guys. So this is my second time "quitting", and my first time using Nicotine Replacement Therapy. I have been using Lozenges (1mg) and having found them extremely helpful and have not smoked in 3 days (early days, I know). 

My main concern is how these affect cravings in the long run. If I were to continue using them, would it "reset" my nicotine dependancy each time the same way a cigarette would, or would it diminish to a degree, provided I don't smoke.

**What I really mean is, would cutting down on NRT be just as difficult as cutting down on smoking, cold turkey?**


Sorry if my question isn't quite clear, but I would really appreciate any feedback at all. Thanks!

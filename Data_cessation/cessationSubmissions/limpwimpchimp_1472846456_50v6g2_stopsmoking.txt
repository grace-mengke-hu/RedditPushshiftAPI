Desperately Need Help [Work]

"Long time lurker, fist time poster"

**Some background:**
I am 25 years old and currently average about 1.25-1.5 packs/day. I have worked at a large company for over a year now as a software developer and have been promoted from an hourly coop to a salaried associate. I do not have a degree yet, but I am skilled in what I do (hence the promotion). Part of the contract was to pursue my degree whilst working full-time (>= 40h/week).

**Dilemma:**
I am aware of the health-related consequences of smoking, but I am young and have been smoking for less than 5 years, so it is not the motivation for this post. My concern **IS** how my smoking habits are affecting my work and the safety of my position...

I recently was offered this full-time position about a month ago. As people are now taking me more seriously and giving me more responsibilities, my smoking habits are sticking out like a sore thumb in terms of my success. I am a fairly restless person and I compulsively feel the need to smoke a cig about every hour. In addition to the nicotine injection, this helps with my restlessness by giving me the opportunity to walk around. In contrast, I seldom see anyone else in my office exhibiting this behavior -- they are, for the most part, able to comfortably sit at their desks for long periods of time (before smoking, I could do this).

I have been concerned for awhile now that people were taking notice of my frequent breaks. I was writing this post earlier, but was interrupted when...

My supervisor pulled me into his office to bring up this very issue. Now it is not only a concern I have, but other people have taken notice. The complaint was that, "He seems to be walking around and avoiding work while smoking cigs." 

My supervisor brought this up to me out of necessity, but he told me my behavior wasn't concerning to him (he's a former smoker also). He said that I am one of the top performers in our IS department and that they knew I wasn't goofing off based on the work I've been producing. I feel similarly, that I am doing strong work, but I also understand where the people who brought the issue up are coming from. **Surely**, taking 8+ smoke breaks everyday at work is excessive. My supervisor's boss told him to coach me on my behavior and effectively the answer was to stop walking around the building, since people are able to see me then and instead walk around another building next to us...

I'm glad my boss/supervisor are on good terms with me, but it is very dissatisfying to know that other higher-ups are starting to view me as a slacker. The time I'm not smoking and at my desk, I go hard and get really into coding (despite me writing this post write now, haha... I'm doing so because this concern is occupying every part of my mind). My supervisor brought up the point that other people goof off in different ways -- lounging around the break room, surfing the web, etc. However, as he said, these behaviors are more discrete and go unnoticed. He told me to relax and not take the comments personally... He is satisfied with the work I do, **BUT I am not satisfied with how I am conducting myself**.

As I previously stated, I have no degree and I am in an extremely generous position right now making more than I have thought possible, doing the work I love! I am so paranoid that I am going to jeopardize this all if I continue on this track. I don't know what an "acceptable" amount of smoke breaks a day might be, but certainly I would surpass that limitation irregardless of who defined it (maybe Slash would condone me). I want to, **NAY**, I NEED to quit as this problem only seems to be escalating. I began smoking two cigs per break, then I switched to 99's/100's to try to achieve the same effect, and **NOW** I'm smoking two freakin' 99's per break. Anytime I meet with someone, I use it as an excuse for a follow-up cig. It's ridiculous and I'm so disappointed in how weak-willed I am. I also recently started taking vyvanse (stimulant like adderall, but time-released) and it only has turned me into more of a fiend (that said it helps my concentration enormously).

Anyway, I am worried sick and would **GREATLY** appreciate anyone's insight into my dilemma. Even more so, I would love to hear from anyone who has been in this same boat and how they dealt with it.

**TL;DR**
   I got the job of my dreams and feel I'm threatening my position via the frequent smoke breaks I take. People have noticed and I need to take action!

Thanks guys!

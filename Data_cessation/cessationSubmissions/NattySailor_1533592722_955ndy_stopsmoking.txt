Night smokers?

I'm wondering if anyone has a similar smoking pattern to me. I started up again about six months ago under the extreme stress of a separation. I will almost exclusively smoke at night, usually while drinking wine or beer, and will usually chain smoke 4-6 cigarettes and then stop. 

The idea of smoking in the morning or during the day is probably about as repugnant to me as to any non-smoker. Sometimes I throw away the smokes in the morning, even dousing them with water to prevent myself from digging them out of the trash later.  

I often exercise during the day, and generally eat pretty well too. But when night falls (and maybe I start feeling a bit lonely or bored), out come the cigs (or I'll buy a new pack if I threw away the previous pack).  I'm like Jekyll and Hyde, smoker and non-smoker at different times of day. It's pathetic.

So I bought a pack of cigarettes...

yes, I did... almost on instinct. And then I sat there, in my car. I must have sat there staring at them for 30 or 45 minutes. (Crazy, I know) I actually sat there talking to those stupid, inanimate objects. Told them I didn't need them. That I refused to smoke them. That they wouldn't help me in any way. And then I dumped out about half of the cup of soda I'd also just bought, opened the pack and one by one, I doused every single one in the pack in that drink. I did not smoke one. Honestly, once I had the pack in my hand, I didn't want to smoke any. I certainly did before I walked into that store. Weirdness. I had even delayed buying them until after I had my meeting with the ex.... did some shopping... but it was like I had to buy that pack and actually destroy them to feel better. I don't know. I feel better though, so I will take it. Maybe it was just something I had to do to exert my power over them. Maybe I have gone mad. I don't really care... all I know is that I DID NOT SMOKE WHILE I HAD THE CHANCE. And it feels pretty awesome.

I don't even feel like I wasted $6.50, because it was so empowering.

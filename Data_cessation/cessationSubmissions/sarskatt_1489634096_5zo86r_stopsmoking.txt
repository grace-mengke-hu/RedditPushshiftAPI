My biggest hurdle

I tried to quit about a week back and failed miserably so I'm going through the missions again on the smoke free app. The mission today is to figure out what I think smoking helps me with. My biggest issue that I've found for me is my anxiety . I know that smoking does not help it in the long run, just the opposite in fact but I do feel as though it helps in the moment when I'm having a panic attack. Has anyone gone through anything similar and have any advice on things I can do to get over that?

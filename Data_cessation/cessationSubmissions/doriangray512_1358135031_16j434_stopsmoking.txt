One week done, the longest I've ever gone cold turkey.

This is my third time trying cold turkey, and both of my other times I made it six days before going to NRTs.  My first big test was on Friday when drinking with some old college friends, two of whom smoke.  The smell got me briefly craving, but I pulled through.  


Working out has helped a whole lot.  I'm a little worried what will happen if I stop working out or that I'm relying too heavily on those post workout endorphins.

Lessons being applied from past attempts: no shows or movies with heavy smoking in them for a while and no form of nicotine is going to help me right now, so my hookah days are done and no NRTs.


My biggest test is yet to come, going back to my hometown where my mother and brother smoke.  It's also the place with all of my strongest triggers.  But I won't need to do that for at least another two weeks.  So far I'm doing well and feeling great.

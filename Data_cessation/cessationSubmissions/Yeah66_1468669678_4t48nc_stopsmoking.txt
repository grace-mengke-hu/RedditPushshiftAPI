For fresh quitters, keep going.

So next week I hit 4 months. 
Look I've been seeing alot of post about like 
how long will I have headaches?
I can't take a shit it's been 10 days wtf 
you know, all that jazz. 

For me, I was fucked up physically and mentally for a good month, month and a half, before I returned to complete normal.

after like a week in though something clicked in my head and the suffering from the dreaded 'first three days' made me realize how fucking stupid smoking is if by simply not doing it for a measly 10 hours makes you feel like dickly shit. 

I quit cold turkey and use regular bubble/chewing gum or a mint if I get a random trigger.

er so my point is keep going. 
it gets better.

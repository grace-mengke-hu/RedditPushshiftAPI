Day 1 - here I go again...fuck!

So after 9 days and doing off and on ok, I cracked after work and bummed one off a coworker.  I got about halfway through and I realized this is as shit as I remember and I fucking kicked myself for even thinking that I could go back.  And what is that smell?  As soon as I got home, my coat went outside on my balcony and I took a shower.  I can still smell it and it kind of makes me sick.  I am so ashamed for letting myself down.  I guess I just needed a reminder of how bad it truly is to fully kick the habit.

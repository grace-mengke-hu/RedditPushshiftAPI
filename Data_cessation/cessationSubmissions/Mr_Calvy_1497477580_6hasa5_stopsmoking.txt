Resetting my 400+ day flair. We're doing this again. GOODBYE CIGARETTES.

Hey. In January 2016 I quit smoking "for good". I used ecigs to wean myself off of niccotine and chamomile tea to replace the habit. I felt barely any withdrawels and I noticed so many things improving over the next year, it was well worth it.   
  
Skip to March this year and I smoked a few cigarettes at a rave, which over the course of a few weeks unfolded back in to full blown dependency. I have been smoking 10 a day since around that time and after a few days of mentally preparing, I'm ready to leave the habit again.. for the last time. It's easy to relapse and it sucks that I did so after over a year of abstinence, but here's to day 0. Last cigarette was at 22:00. I'm done harming myself for the sake of an illusion - anyone else out there starting tonight? LET'S GO!!

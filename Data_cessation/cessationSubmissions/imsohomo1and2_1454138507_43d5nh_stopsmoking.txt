i want to quit cigarretes, quick question

i was off cigs for a while mabey a year, and 2 months ago I started back on them because I had an opiate habit relapse, (im on subs now), I was only smoking 4-6 malrboro reds a day and I bought the patch 14mg but I Think it was too strong because I got very bad nausea / racing heart rate almost right after putting it on. I held out for 4 hours but then took it off. Would quitting cold turkey be better? Since my habit was light?

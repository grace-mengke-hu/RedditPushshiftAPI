Day 1 down.

Hi guys. I've been a long time lurker on this sub. I'm only 21. I've been smoking a  chronic amount of both weed and tobacco, usually at the same time, for probably 4 years now.

Last night I realized if I don't stop soon, I'll do further permanent damage than I've already done. I got on the patch yesterday at 5 pm after taking my last hit.

I'm only 24 hours into this and it has been one of the toughest things I've ever had to try in my life. Instead of breaking down right now and cracking on a promise I made to myself. I'm writing this post.

To those of you who have successfully quit, or are trying to quit a vice right now and are reading this. Know that you're an inspiration to me. I read posts on this sub and get overcome with jealousy. 1 week, 1 month, 1 year, all feats I've never been able to accomplish. 

But all that said, you people give me something to strive for, as well as motivation that it can be done. That I can actually do this. For that I owe anyone who posts or comments on this sub a great deal of respect and thanks.

While it's a struggle we have to face mostly alone, it's a struggle a lot of us are in together.

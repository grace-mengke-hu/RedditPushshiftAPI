It's been over a week since my last cig

My second time quitting. Lasted 4 months on my first attempt and crumbled on a night out. I'm now 8 days in to my second attempt and I've managed to resist the temptation on a night out which I'm super happy about. Taking it day by day and week by week but I'm already feeling so much better this time round!

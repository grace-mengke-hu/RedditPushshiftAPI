Hey guys, I just quit smoking cigs and am on my 2nd day in. Its been approx 40 hrs in. I used to smoke about 10 a day for 6 years. Im currently 26 yold.

For some reason, Im getting some tight chest feelings that doestn feel great when im breathing. I mean, the breathing is fine but it feels like someones sitting on my chest. Is this normal ?

Day 18 was a shitty day

Today was one of the most stressful days since I quit.5 hours of sleep, an important exam that took 4 hours and a fight with my mom afterwards.I'm happy to say that I still didn't smoke today and i feel like after managing this day without smoking, any normal day is going to be way easier.

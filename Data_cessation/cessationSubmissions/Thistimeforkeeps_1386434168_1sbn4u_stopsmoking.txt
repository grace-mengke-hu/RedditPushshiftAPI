Money, money, money (or another reason to continue my smoke free journey)

Just checked the bank account to finish Christmas shopping.  There is just over a Â£1000 in there (payday is next week).  That's about the amount husband and I have saved since stopping smoking 2 months ago.  Won't be worried about financing Christmas for the first time in 10 years.

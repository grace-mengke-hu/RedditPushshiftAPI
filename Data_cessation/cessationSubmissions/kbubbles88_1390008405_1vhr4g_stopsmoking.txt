2.5 weeks smoke free and I have a question...

I was smoking from around the age of 13 to the age of 25. I just quit smoking at midnight on NEw Year's Eve this year and I am curious about some stuff. I like to run, and I haven't felt much of a change, in fact I feel like I'm doing worse distance-wise.  My body also feels kind of shitty and I've found myself feeling kind of low which is pretty out of character for me. I know smoking hinders the immune system, but I'm getting sick! 
Is this stuff common? I feel like shit and it's really making me second-guess my decision to quit. I'm really only quitting because I started dating a guy who doesn't smoke. I really enjoyed smoking and the cravings really haven't subsided at all 2.5 weeks in. 
Some insight and maybe words of encouragement would help.

Day 13 & going strong!

Day 13 for hubby & I. Just wanted to say I have found this group very helpful, scrolling through all of the comments. Other helpful aids: the Smokefree App & Nicorette Spray (1 mg). I used to use the lozenges/gum but they were so minty so affected anything else I ate or drank. The spray gives me the hit but the mintyness dissipates fairly quickly so much better for me.

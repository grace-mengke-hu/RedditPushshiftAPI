31 days - Officially over one month.. BUT, the last few weeks especially the last days have been anxiety/depression filled.

As the topic says, 

I'm happy to pass the one month mark again.. but I don't feel too good.

Depressed and anxious... Anyone else felt that way a month in? Or is it time to get on some medication? I have had issues with anxiety/depression these last few years and that's one of the reason why I want to quit poisoning myself.

My doctor didn't seem to think that medication was the best idea this early into my quit, he wanted to take a wait and see approach. And I agree of course, but that doesn't help me right now in the moment though.

Need some support guys and anecdotes from people who've been where I am emotionally a few weeks in.......

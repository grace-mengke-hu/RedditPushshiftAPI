Quitting changed me

Going on two months smoke-free, after smoking on and off for about a year and half. It might not sound like much, but it's extremely difficult for me to let go of anything I feel attached to. Addiction, of different types, has run on both sides of the family for several generations. I didn't want to contribute anything more to that history. More importantly, I wanted to do it for me. I didn't want to feel enslaved anymore. 

Quitting empowered me. I never thought it was possible, especially not for this long. Now, I don't say "I can't quit/do this." Instead, I think "What else can I do?" It's opened my mind to possibilities I would never have considered before, and that's one of the best things I have gained from this experience. 

Do I still struggle? Absolutely, and not just with this particular addiction. However, I feel more capable of overcoming these obstacles now, and I actually have the determination to do it. 

On a related note, I'm incredibly proud to say that my dad just celebrated 31 years of sobriety. I just really wanted to share that with people. It inspires me during this journey, and I hope it does the same for you guys.

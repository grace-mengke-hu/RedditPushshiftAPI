How to deal with insecure smokers?

Hey all!   


I am in a bit of a funk right now.  My mom is a non stop chain smoker.  She bought me my first pack at 14.  She has had a brain aneurysm from smoking; and has never stopped.  I told her I do not like her smoking in the same room/in the car with me as it is nauseating and frustrating at the beginning of my quitting.  She never respected it.  So yesterday, when I was barely getting up in the search for coffee, she started yelling about how she needed to leave the house because "she would bitch about it."   


I've had health issues/surgeries that are a big reason for why I am staying at my step dads/moms house.  I am at the point of not giving a fuck if she smokes around me; I can't stop her.  I can only leave the room.    


But the sick part is that my family is pretending like I haven't actually quit, taking away my quit time, and my step dad uses the logic of, "well, you've smoked a lot, haven't you sym?  A whole lot! You even stole cigarettes from your mom!" \[a claim that is based on me smoking her butts in ashtrays when I wouldn't control my cravings/wasn't interested in buying packs anymore\]   


Tldr: family of smokers insecure about their own habit, how to avoid them &amp; stay chill about mine?   


Thank you for taking the time to read this!

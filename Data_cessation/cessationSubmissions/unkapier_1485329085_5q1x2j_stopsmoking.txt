I'm angry, I can't sleep, I want a cigarette and it's making me angrier. It's a vicious cycle.

Dammit! What the fuck is going on? I've quit twice before without any problems but this is driving me nuts. The stupidest things are setting me off. I don't want to be like this but I don't want to smoke anymore. Well, actually I do. I just don't want to hack my guts out every morning or get lung cancer. I was calm, cool and collected. I could handle any problem and come up with a solution. But now, I just throw my arms up in disgust and pitch a temper tantrum. And it's getting worse. Even acknowledging the problem is getting me pissed at myself. All I can think is, just go get a pack of cigarettes and it will be better. I'm 45 fucking years old... I shouldn't be this dependent on a god damn pacifier. I can't even reason with myself right now. This sucks!

FUCKEDY FUCK FUCK! This sucks! It's 2AM and I can't sleep. FUCK!

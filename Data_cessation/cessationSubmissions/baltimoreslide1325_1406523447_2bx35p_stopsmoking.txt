Got too busy with happy nonsmoker life and forgot to post: 7 DAYS!

It'll be 8 days in a couple hours.  
It's awesome!  
Truly I am shocked by how quickly the obsessive nicotine mind games stopped. Really, if you don't feed them, they go away so quickly--I thought it would take way longer. I barely even had cigarettes pop into my mind today and was out living normal life. I played a show and drank last night.  
  
Day 1 people! You got this!  
  
(Yes I know--staying vigilant is super important in this phase, too.)  
  
So immensely grateful for the people on this sub who got me through the multiple failures and weak moments!!!

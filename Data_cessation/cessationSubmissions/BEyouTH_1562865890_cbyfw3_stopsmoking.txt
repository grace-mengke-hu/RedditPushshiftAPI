Struggling

I smoked 1-2 cigarettes a day for 10 years on and off. For much of that time, I convinced myself that I was in full control and that I was only smoking socially or for a little stress relief.

7 months ago, I decided to never smoke again, and it has been SO HARD. At least once a week, I have to talk myself into driving past the gas station I always bought smokes from. Every TV show and movie has cigarettes in it, and when I see them, I want to go buy some.

I guess, moral of the story is, it doesn't matter how little or how much you smoke, it's no bueno.

Keep on fighting my friends!

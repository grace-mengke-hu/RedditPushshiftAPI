The essence of it

From "stop smoking now" by Allen Carr:
pg. 132

"although you know smoking causes serious problems, you also believe cigarettes provide benefits.  if only there were a substitute that has all the advantages and none of the disadvantages.  Obviously you don't want the deterioration of your physical and mental health, or the cost, slavery, filth, or stigma.  But you do want the feeling of relaxation you get when you light up.

I have great news for you!  That feeling of relaxation is what nonsmokers have all the time.  The only reason you light up is to try to relieve the empty, insecure feeling of the body withdrawing from nicotine which nonsmokers don't suffer from in the first place.  In reality, you smoke to try to feel as a relaxed nonsmoker.  There is only one way to feel like a nonsmoker and that is to become one."

**"in order to become a happy nonsmoker, you need to be crystal clear that you are giving up NOTHING, only making marvelous, positive gains."

Truer and more welcomed words have never hit my mind before.  What a fucking great book!

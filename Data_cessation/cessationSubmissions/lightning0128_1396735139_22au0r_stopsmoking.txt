Messed up a couple nights ago.


I have been a lurker on this sub for a while now. I quit last September, and felt GREAT about it. Since then I have had two moments of weakness. 

Both occured when I was out with some friends drinking. It was later on in the night, and I was reealy wasted. A friend was smoking and offered me a cig. Both times I took it, had a puff or two and realized what I was doing and put it out. I felt disgusted with myself for smoking and promptly felt like ass for a couple days after.

The first time this happened was late January, and the second time was two nights ago.

I was initially so dissapointed in myself, that I was pretty much unmotivated to get out of bed the day after; but I realized at some point that the fact that I was going through a mental breakdown of sorts about having 2 puffs that I still cared about quitting and staying cig-free. I am feeling a lot better today and I have a couple of exams coming up. I am using the studying as a nice distraction to keep my mind off the failure of a couple nights ago.

As I did when I initially quit, I returned to this sub every time I had a craving. All the success stories gave me inspiration / the strength to deal with it.

Thanks r/stopsmoking, stay strong!

ok try this again

I fell off the wagon after a night of birthday partying. Shouldn't probably get so wasted in my new circumstances of trying to stop... lol  .. but anyway... gleefully disposed of them yesterday. So this is what I figure my approach will be... constructive criticism welcome. 1. face life head on... don't try to insulated myself from temptation. 2nd hand smoke, blah blah... 2. fight a craving if I have one... and don't worry about anything instead of the moment. I'm adding this also ... that I read that cravings can cause time distortion, so if I have a craving I make a mental note of "timing it" they say it won't generally last more than 3 minutes ... for me ... more like less than a minute 3. No NRT (for me) ... which I love when Carr facetiously calls it... NCT nicotine continuation therapy... and the piece de la resistance.... 4. The Carr attitude... that I'm not missing out on anything... rather what a pleasure it is to be able to do whatever I want without having to smoke... its a plus not a minus. Thanks in advance for the usual support.

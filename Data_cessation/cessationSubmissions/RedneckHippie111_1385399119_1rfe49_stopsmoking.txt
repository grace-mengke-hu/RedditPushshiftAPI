2.5 days in, going strong

I knew there would be a sub like this on Reddit, and I am posting because the more people I tell about quitting, the more people there are to keep me honest.

Today is the third day since I quit, and it has been going well, the longest I have been without a cigarette in almost 4 years. This is my 4th attempt at quitting, and honestly, the first time I have really planned it out and really wanted to be done. I'm using the nicotine patch this time, all other times I tried just cold turkey.  It has helped a lot with the nic cravings, but I still get the urge to smoke.  It was bad on the second day when I was at home watching football, but I was able to talk myself out of it every time (I still had cigarettes in a jacket pocket then, but have thrown them out).  My family has been supportive, both my parents were smokers who quit when I came along.  My Dad told me to add up chunks of time, 24 hours, then 48, 72, 96, etc, and eventually I'll be through it.  Here's to hoping 4th time's a charm

Day two...

i think i picked a bad time to quit. Life hasn't beed particularly kind to me as of late; I'm struggling to find full time work, friends are moving away, i have had no luck with women in close to a year now. Me quitting is bringing back a lot of thoughts of failed relationships, friends, and in general every negative thought that is locked in my mind. This is a very hard time for me, but i feel if i can make it through this, i can conquer anything i set my mind to. wish me luck

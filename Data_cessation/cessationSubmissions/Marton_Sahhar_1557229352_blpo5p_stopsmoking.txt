Day 69 of not smoking.

Proud, satisfied, and giggling immaturely. 

Anyway, here's a little story: last weekend, I went to a metal concert. It's a typical venue, and I've been going to the same spot eve since it opened. Got a decent smoking area and a huge portion of metalheads smoke. A lot. 

Ever since I quit 69 (teehee)  days ago,  I haven't attended a concert. So last weekend felt like a trial by fire, especially after I took a re-bull (since I don't drink either)  and the cravings skyrocketed. But a sparkling water later, they subsided.  I could actually walk to the smoking area, chat with my friends between bands and not even think about smoking. In fact, I had to go back after a short while because I couldn't quite stand the smell. 

I won't go as far as saying I'm free, for are we ever really? But it damn sure feels like so. :-)

To any one new here, stick to not smoking. And then post a story around your 69th day :-P

Any advice on not being angry?

I've managed to quit smoking over a year ago, and just kicked my e-cig about four weeks ago. Things are going good. I don't really have any cravings, but I can't seem to stop getting angry over nothing.

I've always been a really chill person. I never really got mad, never been in a fight, and about the only thing that made me mad was road rage, which involved me calling your car stupid and then going on about my day. But now, I'm finding I get angry about the dumbest stuff. And I can hold a grudge for a while. Apparently nicotine kept my nerves fine, and without it, I'm a freaking wanker.

Does anyone have any ideas on how to handle this?

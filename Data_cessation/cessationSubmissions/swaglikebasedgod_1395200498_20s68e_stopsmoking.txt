It's time

So I'm ready to quit, more than I've ever wanted to before. And I have so many reasons to quit. I'm 19 and I've smoked for like 5 or 6 years, I hate it and its so gross. I've been trying so hard for like a month, but only to slip after losing my cool, and thats even after blowing almost $100 on a vaporizer. I have cut myself back though, I went from a pack a day to maybe 3 to 5. And today is my first day completely cigarette free. But I need help and support.

Why am I such an emotional wreck on my first day!?

Today is my quit date. It is 1:30 and I haven't smoked in 15 hours.
 
I am an unbearable mess.

I just want to cry. Seriously, that's all I feel like doing (and smoking, obviously). I don't know how it's possible to be this emotional ON THE FIRST DAY. I've only been awake for about 5 hours and it has felt like easier 10 times that. This day is taking sooooo long.. I just want to cry.

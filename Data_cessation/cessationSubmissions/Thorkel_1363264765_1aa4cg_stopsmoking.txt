After a year in which I very nearly kicked the habit . . . 

I'm slipping back into my old ways.  Fortunately, I only crave really badly when I drink, but due to the nature of my social life, that still means I'm having about half a cigarette every 4-10 days :(

After waking up yet again to realize that I just threw away another four days of progress getting back on the wagon, my self-loathing could not be deeper.  My long-distance girlfriend, who I'm visiting next week, thinks I've quit for good, and I don't want to tarnish the time I spend with her by craving and thinking about cigarettes :(  So here I am again. 

 Day 1.

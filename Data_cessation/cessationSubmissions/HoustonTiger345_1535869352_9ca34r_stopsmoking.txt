I’ve decided to quit smoking....need tips and advice

I just had my 28th birthday, single, father of one 3 year old daughter who smokes 2-3 black and mild cigars a day(no idea what that translates to in cigarettes).  The past week I have gotten 3 signs to smoking. The first was my 3 year old picking up a black and freaking it.  The second was earlier today when I dropped my black out of the car while ashing it, and had to contemplate slamming on the brakes to stop and find it. 3rd was about 6 hours ago when my daughter grabbed my cigar and threw it behind the couch and said “no daddy, you can never have it!!” 


I think I was more of a habitual smoker, wake up and take a few puffs, any time I’m driving, I feel like I HAVE to smoke. After eating a meal, and every day at 4 pm and 8pm(my normal work break times). 

I want to try to quit cold turkey. Can anyone tell me what to expect, how much this is going to suck, and how I overcome this addiction?  

Thank you.

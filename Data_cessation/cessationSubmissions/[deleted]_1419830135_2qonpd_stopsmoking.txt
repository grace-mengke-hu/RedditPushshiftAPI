81 days and $960 saved.

My fiance and I quit together (we shared a pack a day between us) and between us have almost saved $2k in less than three months. I knew how much cigarettes were but never really considered how quickly the savings would add up. Anyway for Christmas I bought myself a new gaming pc with my savings :-) Next on the list are some accessories for my motorbike! 

I had tried to quit a few times before but only because I felt like I should rather than because I actually wanted to. I'm almost 30 now though and had developed a bit of a cough (now gone). This was my main motivation as before smoking didn't obviously affect my health so it was easier to rationalise.

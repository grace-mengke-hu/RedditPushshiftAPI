First day quitting for the third time. Hopefully this will help!

I've tried cold turkey, I've tried e-cigs and I've tried the patch. The patch seems like the best option (hence what I'm using now). I still have cravings with the patch, which I'm not sure if that's normal.... Anyway, I just want to be able to breath again and not be smelly all the time.

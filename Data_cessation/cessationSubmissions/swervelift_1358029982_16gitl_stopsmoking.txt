I quit smoking 3 years ago. If you're trying to quit, please read what I have to say. It might help.

I used to smoke a lot of cigarettes.


For about 5 years (from 17 - 22 years old) I smoked heavily, often a pack a day or more.

I really enjoyed it too. I've never been the most balanced person, and smoking gave me a way to sort of manage my emotions. It was a crutch, and the longer I smoked the more it became an integral part of my being and the way I dealt with things in life. 


On top of that, I've never been the most socially adapted person, and smoking gave me a way to meet, talk, and share something with other people. I met some of my best friends through smoking.

I tried quitting many times. I knew smoking was terrible for me, and it was costing me a fortune (I lived in the northeast, where it was easily $12+ per pack - at a pack per day you do the math). But I also had a death wish. At some level, I was more concerned with the temporal state of myself, the one that just needed to smoke another cigarette to feel OK - I wasn't worried about future me. I knew that I should quit smoking, but deep down I was selfish and short-minded.

I tried a lot of things to help me quit - cold turkey, gradually, nicorette, hypnosis, Allen Carr's book. I tried and failed many times before I finally got it.

This is the advice I have for smokers who actually want to quit: 

**1. Understand why you want to quit.** You already need to quit, that's just a fact. But unless you truly want it, for yourself, it won't happen. "We're all going to die someday, why not enjoy smoking, am I right?" It's very hard to argue with that logic, especially during withdrawal. I learned that instead I had to say "We're all going to die someday, why not take care of myself and do what I know is right, even if it's not easy?"

Unless you truly accept that quitting smoking will be a painful period of readjustment, you won't be able to succeed. It's not easy. When you learn to value your health, and respect yourself enough to see the damage you're doing, then you can start to quit. If you don't want to, you won't. That's just human nature.

**2. Learn to be self-aware.** Cigarette smokers are typically ultra-senstive to their emotional states. That's why it's so hard to quit. You can physically feel when your body is craving a cigarette, and you know exactly what will trigger it. My favorite time to smoke was right after a good meal, with coffee. The more aware you become though, the easier it is to pinpoint when you want to smoke and how to avoid those situations or at least endure them.

**3. Don't pretend it's "just a bad habit".** Your mind has become dependent on nicotine to survive. Let that sink in for a second. Your mind depends on nicotine to survive. The same way you need food, water, or rest. The longer you've been smoking, the more you've conditioned your mind and body to expect nicotine at certain intervals, and your emotional survival is largely dependent on it. You're like Pavlov's dog, conditioned to expect a cigarette every time a number of different things occur.

This is a perfect metaphor for what smoking does to your mind: http://static.themetapicture.com/media/elephant-tied-post-mindset-mind.jpg

So when you quit smoking, you're actually disrupting the way your body copes with reality. This will have a MAJOR effect on the way you deal with everyday life, especially during moments of stress.

It takes years to adjust to being a non-smoker. It's a matter of **re-educating** your body, and **re-routing** the way you cope with stress. When I would normally pick up a cigarette to deal with anxiety, I learned to instead go for a run, take a hit of weed, or do one of many other new habits that formed after I quit. These aren't perfect replacements, but over time you will adjust and your body will find a natural balance again.

Your actual psyche and personality depend on smoking to exist in their current state. When you quit smoking, it will change who you are as a person. In most cases, given a year or two to adjust, these changes will be for the better.

**4. Stop thinking of your mind and body as different things.** You aren't your mind, and you don't have a body. You are your body, and your mind is an extension of it. Therefore, the chemicals you put into your body will augment your mind and your view of reality. You can't hurt one at the benefit of the other. Take care of your body, and your mind will improve as a result from it. It just might have some growing pains.

**5. Make it easy for yourself.** Don't go from a pack a day to nothing cold turkey. I started by switching to American Spirit, a brand that doesn't treat their tobacco with as many chemicals as other brands like Camel or Marlboro. The chemicals in those cigarettes are probably harder to quit than nicotine itself - so by switching first it made it that much easier. From there, I cut down to 2-3 per day instead of 20, and eventually just stopped.
Be realistic about it. Try not to take an 'all or nothing' approach to quitting - it's dramatic and shortsighted.

**6. Be prepared to make sacrifices.** Your grades, your productivity, your level of fun. Your weight. That perfect cigarette after a big meal. The one you have after sex. Your excuse to talk to the cute girl "hey, you gotta light?" Those times when you're on the balcony, looking out at the city with a glass of whiskey in one hand and a cigarette in the other. You might even have to sacrifice a few friends. Over time you will make up for the temporary sacrifices - think of it like an investment you're making that will pay off in the long term.

**7. Exercise.** I don't need to elaborate here - but it is the best way I've dealt with stress after I quit smoking, and it reinforced that I was finally taking care of myself.

I changed a lot when I quit smoking. I had to. Otherwise there was no way for this new amount of nervous energy to go anywhere. I work out almost daily now, I eat healthy, I drink more alcohol (not saying that's good, but it's what happened). Instead of smoking a cigarette, I also learned to simply face my problems. I didn't hide from them or ignore them. I'm a better person now. I'm honest with myself. I'm mature and I'm stronger. 

The other day, I was with an old friend who still smokes after all these years. He pulled out a pack of cigarettes and I thought to myself "I'm glad I was never a smoker." It took a few minutes before I remembered that at one point I was.

So yes, the cravings will go away. 

I hope this is helpful, and if you have any questions I'm happy to give my thoughts. My life has improved vastly since I quit smoking, and I'd love to help another person do the same.

TL;DR: The key to quitting smoking is finding ways to redirect your stress and anxiety into new, healthier habits. It takes time, and it will undoubtedly change who you are as a person â€“ but it will more than likely be for the better.

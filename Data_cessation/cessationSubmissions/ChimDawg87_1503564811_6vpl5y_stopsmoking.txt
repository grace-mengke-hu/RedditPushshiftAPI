Quit smoking because of dentist

I went in on Monday for a deep cleaning and the dentist informed me that I have to wait 7-to-14 days before smoking again, but I should just quit altogether. I had to quit smoking so my gums can heal. Smoking delays the healing process. I'm on my 2nd day of not smoking and I want one so bad. I have these thoughts which are mostly excuses to light up again. Man, this is tough.

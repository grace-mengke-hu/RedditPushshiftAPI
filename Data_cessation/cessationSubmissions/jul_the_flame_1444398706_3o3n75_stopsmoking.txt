My little unfinished story with cigarettes. My opinion won't be popular.

Hey there /r/stopsmoking, be gentle, english isn't my 1st language but i'd like to share my journey this far. 

I've never been a big smoker. I started in january 2012, when I was 24 while being in a foreign country for an internship. 

Cigarettes there were so cheap, I had two packs of Malboro for 3$CAN. 

I started with one every two/three days. I kept saying to myself that i'd stop once back in canada, but i've never really stopped. 

Usually, i'd smoke around 8 to 10 cigs a day. Last year, I stopped completely for two weeks and relapsed with one a day for a month before starting again "full time". 

Even tought I wasn't a big smoker as some of you were (or still are), I was awake at night coughing heavily, breathing was always difficult, the wheezing was constant. I always felt tired, I know I smelled... I'm an elementary school teacher and during recess, when I stepped outside to smoke and came back inside in the teacher's lounge, I know I didn't smelled good (once, someone who didn't knew I was in there said "Hey, it smells like cigarette!?" even tought i *just* came in and she was on the other side of the table). 

On month ago, I went to get some nicotine chewing gum. It helped be going trought sudden cravings. 

Today, i'ts been a month since i've decreased to one cigarette a day. I can't help myself: I love smoking. My daly cigarette is the moment I take immediately after coming home after work. It's my way to transition. I know that when I smoke this one, I won't have to think about work after that (even tought I still work from home sometimes). 

Some day, I wish i'll have the strenght so stop completely. Even tought it's just one per day, I still cough in the morning and in my bed before sleep (but it's WAYYYY less than before). 

**tl;dr: not a big smoker but decreased to one cig a day and the next step is to stop completely but for the moment i'm not sure about it.**

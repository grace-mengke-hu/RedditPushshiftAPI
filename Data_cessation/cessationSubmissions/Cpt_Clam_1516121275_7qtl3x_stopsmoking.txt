If I had known how painful it would be to quit smoking I wouldn’t have started.

I think people who are taking up smoking right now, teenagers or whoever, should be informed of the complete bullshit it takes to get through quitting. On Day 14 now and feeling great, but also have had the hardest two weeks of my life, and know I’m still in for another four weeks of hell,

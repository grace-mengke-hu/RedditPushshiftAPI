Is Allen Carr's book a hypnosis?

So I was tripping on shrooms recently, and I had been reading this book and I started thinking about it.

At the beginning of the book he mentions seeing a hypnotherapist, perhaps as some way of opening your mind to possibility of being hypnotized. I don't know how it works really.

The writing is pretty bad and seems mostly structured towards repeating certain phrases and invoking certain emotions in you.

I don't know, maybe I was just shrooming too hard and seeing connections where there are none, but I really would like to think that I just got hypnotized into quitting smoking via a bunch of text. That's pretty cool.

He says many times that "when you finish the book you will never smoke again.", which is kind of how hypnosis works right? You instill a very strong belief in somebody?

edit: After having seeing his website I think the evidence strongly points to him having put elements of hypnotherapy into that book. http://allencarr.com/42/how-the-clinics-work

10 days ago, I spontaneously and quietly had my last cigarette

I had always expected quitting to be a "special" experience in the sense that I would find the perfect time and place to do so. I had imagined quitting the way a teenager imagines virginity: a perfect and sublime moment that changes one's life. But that moment never came. There will **never** be a "right" time to quit. It will always be scary. It will always be difficult. It will always be painful. 

**If you want to quit, don't wait for the right time. That is never going to come. If you want to quit tomorrow, quit today.**

Not much else to say, except how happy and surprised I am to have made it this far. Today I have strong cravings. Maybe the worst they've been in a few days. But I must resist. I wanted to write something for this community because, just by lurking, I have received strength from this subreddit. I want to share that strength with fellow smokers who may be lurking on the fence. 

10 days clean. Already $50 saved. Today may be difficult, but in tomorrow I have faith.

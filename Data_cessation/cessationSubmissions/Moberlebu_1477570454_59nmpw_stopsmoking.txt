agony

I made it past two months and I do feel liberated, healthy and proud of myself:D I don't even really miss the cigarettes anymore, and I used to smoke a pack a day. But then why the hell am I still craving them? I don't get it.. I don't want to smoke, I don't miss it, I think it smells bad and it's a slow form of suicide, but still, at least once a day, I get a MASSIVE craving, it's like a wall of smoke desire. I am having one right now, which is why I am writing.. It's like my body and my brain conspire against me, it's like I have a Gollum living inside me and he just will not let me forget MY PRECIOUS NICOTINE. 
Fuck that. I am not giving in.

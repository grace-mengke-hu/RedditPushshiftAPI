Question about coughing

Hey guys, it's almost day 5 for me and I'm feeling confident about this quit. I was just wondering if it's normal that I'm not coughing up any of the gross stuff from my lungs yet? I've read a couple of posts that talk about non-stop hacking it up in the first couple of days, and I just haven't had the pleasure. 

Let me know what you think? I want to get this stuff out of there!

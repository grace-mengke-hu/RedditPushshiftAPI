Going to start running again. Join me!

I used to run long distances back before I became a shell of myself. As I take this incredible journey of rediscovery, I want and need to start my running again. Tomorrow, I will start running just one mile. I will continue that every day for a week. After 1 week, I'll increase it by 0.25 miles. A very small amount but by the end of four weeks, will be running two miles a day. Then will continue this until (for me) I reach my 10 miles a day routine in roughly ~ 9 months from now.

I'll be including my run completion on my daily post and encourage anyone who wants to participate here or over in /r/stopdrinking to join along and post in the comments!

Have a great evening!

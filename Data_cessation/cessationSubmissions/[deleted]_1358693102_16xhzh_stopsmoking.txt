Does it ever stop?

It's been 200 days now since my last smoke, and while my health has improved significantly the bloody cravings just simply won't go away.

I understand that I will never be completely rid of them but this is just getting ridiculous. I've been getting DAILY cravings for more than a month now and it seems to me that for some reason they're just getting worse.

All my normal craving remedies (i.e. gum, sunflower seeds, etc..) stopped working and I fear I might relapse soon.

So has anyone else experienced cravings of this magnitude 7 freaking months after quitting or is there something seriously fucked up with my brain?

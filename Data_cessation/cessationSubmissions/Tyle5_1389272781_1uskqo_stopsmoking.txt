One week of no smoking

I've been nicotine free for a whole week now. I'd previously smoked for around 15 years and decided to quit as a New Year Resolution. I've taken the old turkey approach and so far it's been going well. In fact it's been going a little too well as so far I've only had minimal cravings and my behaviour hasn't changed too much. Is this normal, and should I expect more severe withdrawal symptoms to come along soon?

Good luck to everyone else stopping at the moment!

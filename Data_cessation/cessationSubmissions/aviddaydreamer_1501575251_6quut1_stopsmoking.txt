It is getting harder to quit. :(

The first time when I lasted two months the Easyway to quit worked wonders for me. But I fell off the wagon and am not able to muster the willpower to try  again. I have reached 20 cigarettes a day again and I feel like I am letting everyone down. Any advise. I am trying cold turkey again.

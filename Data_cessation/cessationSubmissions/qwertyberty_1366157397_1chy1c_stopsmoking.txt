I've been doing great for almost three weeks. I have Pokemon to thank for it.

For me, whenever I have the urge to smoke, I just whip out my Gameboy and play for a few minutes. I've been good since late March. 

The point of this post is that sometimes the biggest help you can get to avoid cravings doesn't need to come in the form of gum or a patch. Good luck

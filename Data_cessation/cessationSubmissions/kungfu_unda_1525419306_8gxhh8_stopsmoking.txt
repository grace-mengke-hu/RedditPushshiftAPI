Was pack a day smoker. Smoked 5 Cigarettes in last 4 months. Need advice

So I was almost pack a day smoker for over 10 years. Quit 4 months back and switched to vaping. However, I find myself enjoying a cig every once in a few weeks or sometimes once a month. This is usually when I'm out drinking with my buddies. I'm not sure what to make of it? Is it because of vaping? Am I still a smoker?

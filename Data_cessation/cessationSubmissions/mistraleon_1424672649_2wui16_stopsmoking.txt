6 days in, the bouts of anxiety and stomach pains are starting to kick in.

Hey all!

I was just wondering if anybody else has experienced bouts of anxiety and/or stomach pains within the first week of quitting? I'm trying my best to hang on...

edit: Also, is it common to feel easily irritated and depressed while quitting? I hope I'm not going crazy lol

Okay - the withdrawal symptoms are finally getting to me. I don't know what to do.

I quit smoking when I got my tonsils out at the end of April. All has been well in good. I've had one drag since quitting, and it was disgusting and just secured my feelings that quitting is the right choice.

But this week has been rough. I'm hungry ALL THE TIME. I feel fatter. I've gained about 5lbs since quitting already. I'm cranky. I'm irritable. I've been sleeping like shit. I feel defeated. I'm constantly feeling stressed.

I thought it was work-related - but this work week has been pretty easy-going. Yet I still feel on edge.

How do you curb your withdrawal symptoms when quitting cold turkey? I'm freaking miserable.

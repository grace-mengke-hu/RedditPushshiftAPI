Back at this again

So I stopped smoking in September and it went quite good for two months, then I caved and smoked like two packs a day. Yesterday was my first day without cigarettes again. Dunno how long I'm gonna last this time, hopefully forever, but somehow I feel like smoking is part of my personality when I'm out of home. It alleviates anxieties I have when talking to people and do stuff outside my comfort zone... Hopefully this time it sticks (:

10 days in feels easier than it should, is there more to come?

Smoked for 5 or so years, average of 7/8 per day but a lot more when drinking. Quit on a whim/pressure from my healthy housemates got to me, and I'm 10 days smoke free. The first 3 days sucked, day 4 was one of the worst days of my life, but cravings have almost abated now. I suck tic tacs to replace my cigarette breaks at work (menthol smoker), and I'm running a lot more. 

I've gone through a family death and a couple of drunken nights without caving in these past 10 days... I guess I'm asking if there's a period where I need to be particularly careful or am I over the worst of it?

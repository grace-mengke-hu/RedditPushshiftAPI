Hello, 

I'm a smoker who was struggling on and off with cigarettes. Vaping doesn't work, nicotine gum didn't work, nothing worked. The reason why I was able to stay off the nicotine products for so long was because of my motivation to quit. It was strong.

I relapsed today, and bought an expensive pack of cigarettes. I need to not do this. I threw away the pack, after smoking one, recognizing that I had just bought death.

I feel ashamed of my behavior, and I need to find a good way to do the following:

Eat three meals a day
Drink water all day
exercise in the morning.

My partner was helping me with quitting, but I realize that now that they are far away, I need some constant reminders. I don't know how to do that but I'll find a way. I'm so close!

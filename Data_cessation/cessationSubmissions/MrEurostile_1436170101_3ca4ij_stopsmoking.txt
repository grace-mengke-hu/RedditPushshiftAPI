I'm really gonna need you for 48 hours

Hi guys. I'm posting here because I'm trying (again) to quit smoking. What helps me the most is when I'm with my parents or with my GF because I don't want to smoke when they're near.

Sadly, my GF will leave for holidays this afternoon and my parents aren't home for 2 more days. 

I'm past the 3 days line already, and I hope I'll make it to a nicotine-free week with a little bit of your help !

And if anybody is in the same situation, it'll be a pleasure to take care of each other. 

Thanks reddit !

EDIT : looks like we made it through together, thank you very much again !

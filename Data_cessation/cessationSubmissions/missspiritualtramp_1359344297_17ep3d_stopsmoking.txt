Ginger green tea is my new night time routine

Day 28!  Yay!  I have a bit of a cold/flu thing going on at the moment but otherwise I've been feeling pretty freakin' good since quitting.  Been lucky in not having too much in the way of cravings, but I'm hungry like a mofo.  
One of the issues that many quitters have is difficulty sleeping, so I've been unwinding in the evenings with a green tea.  I put some ginger in the tea too, because it's anti-inflammatory and I heard it might be good for cleaning out the lungs too!  I like to chop up about a half a tablespoon, which I put in my tea-ball about half green tea half ginger, and I drink between one and three cups.  If you don't have a tea ball, you can also use a garlic press to squeeze the juice directly into hot water and add a tea bag.  Using this method, cut up 2 pieces of ginger each to be about the size of a garlic clove.  Or if you think I've crazy for having a tea ball AND a garlic press, then just coarsely chop the ginger and drop it right into the hot water.  
I usually find some of the lung butter loosens up while I'm drinking it so you can really feel it working.  
The green tea is also great for your skin, and I've been noticing that my HUGE smile lines that go right back to my hair line are becoming much less noticeable, and my acne is clearing up.  I barely wear foundation or powder anymore since a few weeks after quitting!  
Thanks for reading guys, I just wanted to share my new healthy bedtime routine with you guys, I hope it helps!  All the best.

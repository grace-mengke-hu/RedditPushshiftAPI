40+ hours in. Cold turkey.

Last night felt like I was in a Kafka novel. Despite the aching limbs and the occasional pang today I'm feeling pretty fucking great. Apologies for patting myself on the back in such a public manner but I'm gearing myself for tomorrows shift. A 13 hour stint in an environment where I'll be exposed to lots of smoking and smoking paraphernalia in which I'm used to having smoke breaks entrenched in my routine. Wish me luck fellow quitters. I'll be kicking the cravings in the balls.

Wow one week!!!

This has been an incredible week. I've had so many ups where I felt so certain I would never ever smoke again and I've had so many downs where I would cry or yell like a maniac. Here I am today though with a #1 next to my name! I did it, I made it one week and if I can make it one week, I can make it forever. Thanks for always letting me lurk and read your posts /r/stopsmoking. I haven't been very vocal, but I have been very observant. You guys rock! Let us all keep up the awesome (and difficult) work!

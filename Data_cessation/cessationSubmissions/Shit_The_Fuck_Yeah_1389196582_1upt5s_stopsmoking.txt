How can I find out how much money I saved by quitting smoking?

**I don't have a smart phone** and I would like to know my quitting stats the way that the *"Quit it"* app for smart phones does.

I'm trying to find a website where I can put in the number of days that I've quit and tell me how much money I've saved, how many packs I haven't smoked, etc.

First Few Weeks and Hunger Pains

I was recently diagnosed with bronchitis, and have been quit for a little while (about 2 weeks). I've read Allen Carr, am using the patch, and generally very happy to be quit, exercising and whatnot- BUT, I have been getting these bizarre aches that seem to be like hunger pains, but 10 TIMES WORSE! It is almost to the point where I am doubled over in pain every time they rise up (which is often!)   

Has anyone else experienced this too?  

I know of the importance of water, yes, and eating healthy.   
Are there any other particular tips that can be offered?!

Thanks!!!

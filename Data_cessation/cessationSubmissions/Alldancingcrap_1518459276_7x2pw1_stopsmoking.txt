I just put out my last cigarette, and now I'm not sure what to do from here.

I'm so tired of waking up and immediately think about smoking. I started smoking when I just turned seventeen years old. I tried one at my bus stop with a bunch of friends. Before I knew it I was asking my older friends to buy packs for me. I started dating a smoker, and thinks escalated from there. I didn't think anything of the health risks at the time. 

Around the time I was 20, I knew I wanted to quit. I didn't feel any health effects at the time, but I was no longer feeling the social aspect of smoking. It was tiring smoking all the time. When I turned about twenty two I stopped smoking cold turkey. I stayed quit for about two years.

I was with a friend at a bar, and she offered me a smoke. I figured why not, I had stayed away for two years just one couldn't hurt. I ended up picking up a pack on the ride home.

I quit again when I met my current boyfriend, at age 24. He was an occasional smoker, but was able to put it down with no problem. I continued to smoke for a little longer, but eventually managed to taper off and then quit for a little over a year. 

Of course, I've picked it up again after thinking, "just one". I made the same mistake as before. Now i'm 28 and just put out my last cigarette. I feel stuck because of how many times I've been through this. 

This time I just want it to stick for the rest of my life.

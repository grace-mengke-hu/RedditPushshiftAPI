I accidentally got my wife addicted and need some help.

I've always been a fairly social smoker, only on friday's with after work beers and sometimes a couple at home after the kids have gone to bed. This works for me, no idea why but I can go weeks without one, no problem.

My wife however started to join me with the night ciggies and now she's started smoking at work. I found out she was sneaking them during the day. She blames me for this, fair enough I suppose.

Anyway, so once I found out I said I'd quit straight up as I don't want her doing it. But this isn't very easy for her.

I've given away all the smokes in the house to coworkers. She does not appreciate my help as she blames me for her smoking.

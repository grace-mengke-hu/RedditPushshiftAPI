Slipping back-how did you stop?

I'm back to like a one a day habit. And for a while I was telling myself that's okay. Sometime I get motivated and say, that's not okay, and I go through the whole day and feel very proud and then bam: I have one at night. I am surrounded by smokers by the way. I quit in November using the patch, should I just buy patches again. How do you stop yourself from cheating?

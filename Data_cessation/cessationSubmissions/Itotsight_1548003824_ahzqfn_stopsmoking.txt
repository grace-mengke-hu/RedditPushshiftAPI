Seeing dreams about starting again and starting thoughts.

13 days and going strong now. 

I remember smoking because it was a habit and a safe barrier. I almost started smoking again because i was almost admitted to psych ward. Me and my mom decided that we didn't think it would have been the best choise so i didn't stay there. I was sure i start smoking if i would have stayed there. Back then psych ward was the reason i started smoking. I have been staying at my moms house from monday. 

I'm not doing great at the moment with my other stuff in life so i miss smoking because it was my safe net or something besides my mom.

And the weird thing: i started seeing dreams where i start smoking again. These started when i quitted smoking. In those dreams i'm dissapointed at myself because i start smoking again. Sometimes i don't even notice i start smoking in the dream and then i feel so sad when i notice it. It feels awful. Then i wake up and think it was  all real. Sometimes i fell back to sleep and smoke again etc and sometimes it takes time when i notice it was all a dream and i'm still not smoking. IT FUCKS MY HEAD! 
Even tho i feel so great when i remember i'm still going strong as a quitter and i have saved so much money. :)

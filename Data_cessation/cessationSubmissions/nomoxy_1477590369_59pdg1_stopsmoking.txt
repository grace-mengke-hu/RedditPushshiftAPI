Desperate to quit- Could use some hacks, encouragement, anything

Hello. I'm writing because I'm trying to start my second serious quit attempt in two months. I listened to the Easy Way book and was able to quit for three weeks before a night of light drinking bowled me over. I listened to it again this past weekend and...well, it just didn't hold the same panache. I don't know if I listened to it too quickly (I took my sweet time with it the first time) or if it just doesn't work well on repeat readings...

Anyway, I feel a hundred times worse since I relapsed. My self esteem is in the toilet and I can't seem to get my mean brain to guide me through the quit process. Every night I stamp out a cigarette and feel so motivated to quit and then I wake up the next morning and the anxiety hijacks my brain. Before I know it, I'm set on my porch puffing away with my morning coffee. (By the way, it hasn't escaped me that I'm violating the "no-whinging" rule of the Carr method). 

If anyone has had multiple quit attempts in a short amount of time, I would love to hear your wisdom, especially.

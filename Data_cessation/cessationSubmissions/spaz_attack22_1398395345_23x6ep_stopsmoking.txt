67 year old mom is quitting smoking, how do I help?

Hi all, apologies if this is the wrong place to post, but hopefully some of you can help me out!

My mom is 67, she has been smoking since she was 18. She finally realizes she needs to quit because she's been diagnosed with COPD. Tomorrow is her "quit day". She's having anxiety about it, which I don't blame her for. We plan on tossing out all ashtrays, remaining cigarettes, matches, lighters, etc. in addition to washing bed sheets and clothes and deodorizing all the rooms in our house.

I've picked up a bunch of gum and sunflower seeds for her, and she said that she knows she's going to be irritable and prefers to be left alone BUT I think it's better to be with someone or do something to take your mind off of it (yet as someone who has never smoked, I admit I have no idea what is best).

How can I help? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I am so proud of my mom for taking this big step!

Doing it cold turkey

Not much to say really, today is the day I decided to quit this nasty habit hard-core and announce it to the world to actually stick to this commitment. I haven't been smoking for that long, not even for a year, but I already started getting annoyed by this compulsive craving for a cigarette almost hourly. So, April 13, 11:20pm is the time I smoked my (hopefully) last cigarette.

For starters, I hope to go for at least one week nicotine-free. I like to believe I have enough willpower pull this off (or not, since I would have done this way earlier) but hey, I think smoking once per week will still be an improvement from smoking once every few hours!

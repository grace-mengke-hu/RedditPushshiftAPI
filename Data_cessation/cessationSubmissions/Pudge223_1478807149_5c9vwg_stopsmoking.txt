Am I allowed to have one?

Hi i went through the catalog and couldn't find anything quiet on point.

I quit smoking abruptly last Friday (11/4). It wasnt planned but something happened with my dad and i made a deal with what i hope is  not the devil.  The gum has been going great.  this is my first honest quit attempt and my first one where i have zero all day.  It sucks because i love smoking but i'm handling it.  Honestly i'm surprised how easy the first few days went and today (day six) is no different.  not to sound like a dick but im gunna breaze through this seven days...

the problem is that my college buddy's wedding is this weekend.  there will be drinking, there will be pot, there will be [other things that induce smoking cravings]; if down a few on that Saturday-- am i undoing everything i've done? do i start from day one again? am i allowed to plan a "relapse?"  what would you do?

Happily Smoke Free - Allen Carr

Hi guys,
So I watched the Easyway to Stop Smoking Webcast this morning. It was great, lots of info to absorb and a couple hours to get ready to stop smoking. And then I stopped. I was nervous but it was a great feeling too. To realise that moment was it, I don't need to wait for anything, it's done and I can celebrate that.

So Allen Carr's method really works and I'm happily adopting it. I guess I was just scared of the with withdrawal period? If I do get that insecure feeling I realise that is because I'm going a certain cure to the disease. So that helps to know that it will go away. And I don't avoid thinking about smoking, I accept and get on with life. Just wondering how other allen carr readers get through this early stage? I know that it's stop and start forever and hate it.. Or destroy this thing now and embrace it - which is what i'm doing. He also says never doubt your decision - which I dont - however a thought could cross my mind and it doesnt mean ive failed it means ive had a thought. Your actions are what really matters. I also read 'The Power of Now' - such a great book. Read Allen Carr way too many times? Try that book.

How much does a slip up affect recovery time?

My original quit date was the 5th of this month. The most enjoyable part of this process, and really whats keeping me going, is looking forward to the added health benefits that are slowly piling up.

I haven't pitched a perfect game, though. St. Paddys was a mess. Had maybe 10 or 12, woke up feeling like shit the next day. My question is how much of a setback a day like that is in the healing process? Im sure some of you have done this before, did you notice any regression in how you felt/ lung capacity/ craving occurrences?

Haven't had any since then though!

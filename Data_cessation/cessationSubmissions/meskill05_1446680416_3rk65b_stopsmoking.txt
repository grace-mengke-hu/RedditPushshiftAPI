Day 15

I am proud of my self even if no one else is. Even though I am using my vape to get thru the rough patches, I went from 3mg of nicotine in the vape to 0mg today . Giving up cigarettes after 33 yrs was hard enough, so doing what I need to do to give up nicotine the easiest way I can. It's really hard when you have no encouragement in the household. Everyone wanted me to quit smoking, now that I have, I have yet,to hear 1positive, encouraging, thing come out of their mouth.  As long as I am proud of myself, I guess that's all that matters.  Sorry, for ranting. Thanks for listening

Relapse 😔

I made it 5 days this time before relapsing and smoking seven cigarettes. I really thought I had it this time... I’m so ashamed. It breaks my heart to reset my counter. Anybody have advice on how to make it past several days? (I know the internet is full of advice, but I’m always interested to see what people in this community say works for them). I’m trying to be happy that I made it as long as I did, but it’s discouraging to feel like I have to “start over”

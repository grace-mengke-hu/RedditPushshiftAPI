Question for those of you who started early in their life.

So I decided to give this thing another try. I've been buying my own packs since I was 13, I'm going to hit 25 this summer. 

For those of you who started early in their development: What did it feel like once you've been clean for a while? 

I have no way of telling how much of an inhibitive factor on my fitness and well-being smoking has had because I can't really compare it to any baseline measurements.

Just wondering if you were surprised by anything your body was able to do, or if it cleared up any ailments?

Best of luck to everyone and myself.

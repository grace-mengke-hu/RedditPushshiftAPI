These little delicious nuts that I used to find fiddly and annoying are now my new best friend. A bowl of these next to my computer, a handful in my pocket. I get a craving and start to munch. They give you the hand to mouth motion and all that sort of stuff. Same with sunflower seeds. By the time I get fed up eating them I have forgotten about my old bad habit! 

They might help you too.

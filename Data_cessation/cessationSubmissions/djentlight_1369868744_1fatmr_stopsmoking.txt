How can I NOT smoke while I'm drinking?

Whenever I go out with my friends or even have a casual beer or two, I find it nearly impossible to avoid smoking. I enjoy it so much that even finding the desire not to is nearly impossible. 

Info: I smoked for 2 years, fully quit for several weeks at a time & relapsed 6 times, smoked on and off, and am now on day 3 without nicotine

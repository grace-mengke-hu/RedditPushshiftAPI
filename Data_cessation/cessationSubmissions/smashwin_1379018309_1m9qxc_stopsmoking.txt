Laid off from work but still going strong!

This isn't my first time quitting. So I knew to avoid smoking through good times, having a drink or coffee with my friends, post meal ciggs, as well as the bad. I will most likely go through worst in my life, as I have been through worst in the past. However, I was laid off a few days ago and I still haven't had a cigg. Not a single puff for 38 days now. 

I love this subreddit. Just reading about what others are going through does a lot for me. To infinity and beyond my friends!

Two more...

I'm fairly new to this subreddit, but in that short time, you all have inspired me. I just finished Allen Carr's book, and for the first time in 10 years, I am ready to free myself from my addiction. Two more cigarettes in my pack, and in exactly one hour (12:00am Easter) I will be a non-smoker. At my worst, I smoked a pack per day. For the last 3 years, I have been smoking 12 per day. In one hour, I will smoke 0 per day.

  I just wanted to thank all of you for sharing your insights and fears; your courage and insecurities; your frustration and your courage. Thank you for reminding me that it's not only possible, but liberating, to stop killing myself.

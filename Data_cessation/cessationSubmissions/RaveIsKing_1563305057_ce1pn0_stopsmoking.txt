I was going to make a gif of it, but that was taking an insane amount of time

Can't stop singing my own version of 1 week by Barenaked Ladies, now that I've gotten it in the bag!  It's not perfect, but it works in my mind and makes me feel good so I thought I'd share:

  

Its been one week since I had a smoke

Took a look in my wallet

I’m getting less broke

7 days since that final drag

And I don’t miss those filthy things the English call “fags”

3 days since ending Carr’s book

I realized it's all my fault, responsibility I took

Yesterday I forgave myself

And for the rest of my life I’ll no longer feel sorry

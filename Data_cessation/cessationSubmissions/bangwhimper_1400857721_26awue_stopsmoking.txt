Anyone Have Advice for a Long Drive?

Hi all,

I'm fairly new to the sub, and a recent ex-smoker. I've been "clean" since Monday, for a total of four days. So far, it's been tough, but I've been able to get through the cravings.

Tonight, however, I'm making a 6 hour car trip, and I'm nervous about it. I always loved to chain smoke and knock back coffees during these long trips, and I keep catching myself thinking about those "open road smokes." Does anyone have any advice to help me fight the urges during the trip? Any other road smokers who have some tricks?

EDIT: Hi everyone! Thanks for all of your help! I made it through the drive without a single smoke -- cross that achievement off my list.

Got an injury. Evaluated life. Need to stop smoking

Tore my MCL and ACL the other week. The stuggle to move around and carry on with things has been awful.





I've decided to use this and turn my lifestyle completely around. Watch what I eat, and more importantly, STOP SMOKING.





Find it cool that this sub is here. I'm in for the ride!

was out today with my uncle and had a triggery shopping

I learned that shopping was triggery for me at the store "downtown" so I watched myself closely and went for a cold water in the Starbucks there. I was glad for the cold water in the Starbucks. That helped a lot.

I didn't feel the crave like I was more triggered by it. I thought carefully what was happening, analyzed it and figured that it was trigger, much less craving.

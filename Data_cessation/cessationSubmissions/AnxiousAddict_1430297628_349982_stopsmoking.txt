Ask yourself the following questions whenever you're thinking about smoking one-

1. Why did I quit smoking?
2. How long did I smoke?
3. How long have I been smoke free?
4. How long do I think it should take to be free of this habit?
5. If I go back to smoking, will I want to quit again?
6. How long will it be before I do? Weeks...Months...Years? When illness strikes?
7. Will quitting be any easier next time around?
8. How do I think smoking will benefit me?
9. Is it worth giving up what I've worked so hard to do?

Be honest with the answers, and you'll realize there is no rational reason for you to smoke again, you're just being stupid.

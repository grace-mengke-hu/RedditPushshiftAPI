How to be supportive of a partner who wants to quit.

When I met my partner back in May he told me right off the bat he was quitting. Fast forward to him getting sick in October and he finally stopped cold turkey. He was talking about how proud he was and bragging to everyone all while begging me to remind him how bad they are and just remind him his lungs won't work right if he has just one. He made it 4 weeks till he picked me up with his car smelling like smoke and I was caught off guard and we ended up getting into a fight about it. Selfishly I took it as he wasn't going to tell me unless he got caught so I asked him to just tell me next time so I'm not surprised. Well for the next 2 months after that I would smell it on him or he'd pull lighters out of his pocket and I'd ask him if he smoked and he'd guilt trip me saying he couldn't believe I'd even think he did and I must not trust him. On Christmas he finally came clean and I told him I didn't even care I just wanted him to keep me updates so I know how he's doing. Half the time he smells like he took a cologne bath so he could hide the smell or if it's a day he's coming right after work then he'll fess up and tell me minutes before picking me up. 

During all this his coworker has been supplying him with cigarettes and every time he tries to quit he begs her not to give him any more and whenever he has a craving she gives him one. Isn't that enabling him? I imagine quitting is hard enough without having someone next to you all day trying to get you to smoke ( She did guilt him when he first quit by saying she had nobody to smoke with on her break)


I just don't know how to be a supportive partner. I feel like I'm being a huge dick to him but all I can see in my mind is how happy he was the day he hit 4 weeks and how worried he looked when he was begging me not to let him go back. How can I be more supportive and helpful when I feel like he's not always honest to me about it.

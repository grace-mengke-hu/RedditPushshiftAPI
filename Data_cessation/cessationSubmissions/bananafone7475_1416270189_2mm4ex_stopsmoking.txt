Does anyone else have nightmares that they smoked a cigarette?

One month in and I had my second nightmare that I smoked a cigarette last night. I remember feeling so shitty about it in my dream then was so relieved when I woke up and realized it wasn't real. 

I'm actually very happy that it made me so bad and disappointed in my dream.

First day.

Today, I will start fresh. I will learn to enjoy running again, and to go outside just to enjoy nature instead of a nicotine high. The excuse of a cigarette will no longer be used as a way to avoid awkward conversation or stressful situations. If I need a break at work, I will take one, no cigarette needed, even if it means getting shit from my boss. All the arguments I have FOR smoking are weak in comparison to the actual cost of smoking ($, smell, health, time, lack of better coping skills).
Thanks for letting me share, Reddit. I hope that sharing this will keep me accountable, as I am not the first person to quit cigarettes!

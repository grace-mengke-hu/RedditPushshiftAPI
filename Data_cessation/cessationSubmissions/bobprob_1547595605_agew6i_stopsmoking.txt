What do you do to keep busy and keep your mind off the craving?

Monday was the start of my journey to quit smoking. It’s almost Wednesday and so far I have successfully been smoke free for 48 hours. BUT MAN, is this hard. What do you guys do to keep busy? Ive been cleaning a ton, more than I ever do. I’m also chewing an ungodly amount of gum.

End of day 2.. I'm such an asshole

So a little back story, I got sober almost a year ago and have now decided to quit smoking. I'm on day 2 and I had success letting go of alcohol and drugs with a support group so I'm here. I was a huge asshole today. And super sensitive. I feel like my boyfriend hates me right now. I'm worried I'll always be irritated and he's going to break up with me. I don't know. Need help.

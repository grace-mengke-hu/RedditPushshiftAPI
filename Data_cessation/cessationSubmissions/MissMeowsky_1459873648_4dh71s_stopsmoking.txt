32 days in... It really does get better!

I was walking to work this morning and realized... I'm a non-smoker. For the first time in 32 days, I really felt like that was my new reality, I really am a non-smoker. And I didn't get anxiety from that realization, and I didn't feel panic at the thought of never ever touching another cigarette in my life.

Even through the rough patches with the BF and the craziness of multiple 12 hours day at work in the past month... It really does get better!!

If you just stopped and you are reading this... Stick with it! Get through it! It might not feel like it right now, but it's so worth it!! You can do it!!

Edit: My badge should actually say 34... Don't really know what's going on there...

44 hours and counting

I smoked a bit more than a pack a day for five years. I've had it my head for the last few weeks, that it's high time for me to quit. I haven't had a cigarette in damn near two days. (I know my badge says 3. I had a slip up and smoked 2 cigs). I'm actually feeling pretty good about this quit. I don't feel edgy or moody. But I know it's going to be an uphill battle from here on out. Thanks for giving me stories of strength and perseverance. You guys rock!

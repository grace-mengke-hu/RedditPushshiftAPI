Being weak on some days is okay

I know people who had to quit once and for all and never smoke again to be able to stop smoking and I admire their discipline. For me, however this approach does not work I would always get weak sooner or later. That's perfectly fine, though. I think the most important thing is not to be mad at yourself, move on and try again. I have an app where I count the days on which I didn't smoke. I don't pay attention to wether I break a streak or not, I focus on the total number. I find that extremely motivating. Even if I fuck uo and smoke a whole pack because I was drunk, it just doesn't matter because I'm already at a point where I've stopped being a regular smoker.

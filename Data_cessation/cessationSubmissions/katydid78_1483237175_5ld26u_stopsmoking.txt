Jan 5th - Quit Day!

Hiya! Jan 5th is the day. I'm in Wellbutrin, will use nicotine gum if needed. I have a huge supply of tic tacs and silly putty. And I've downloaded a stop smoking app. I've got my friends on board to help if I feel like I'm wanting to go buy a pack. What else has worked for all of you successful stoppers to deal with cravings and stress???

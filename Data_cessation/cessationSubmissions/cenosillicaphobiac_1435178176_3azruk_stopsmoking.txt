First break at work

So it begins.  I smoked the last of my cigarettes during lunch today.  That was 3 hrs ago.  It's now break time, I'm not going to bum one, I'm not going to rush madly to the local convenience store (I could probably just barely make it) I'm going to dink around on reddit for the (now) remaining 12 minutes.  Driving home will be the next challenge.  I pass 8 convenience stores, 4 on a convenient (see what I did?) side of the road to make it only a 2 minute stop.  That would be the most damaging 2 minutes I could imagine.

Its been &gt;6 months that I have quit smoking. I tried to smoke today - man fuck those cigs. fuck tobacco.

yo, I smoked ~4-6 cigs per day from 2009ish-2010 to 2017 September. i am still in the lowest 5% of cigarette smokers because people smoke packs per day while I smoked a pack a week. 

I maintained this for a good 6-7 year period and I stopped. Today morning I purchased a packet for the kick of it, and smoked one. fucking hell.


it tastes like some puked 2000 chemicals into my mouth. I can test elements, metals. I am not joking I can taste them. I had 2 puffs and i coughed. I did not want to smoke at all. I have zero urge to smoke. I have no interest. 

How did I quit? I just woke up one morning and I took 1 day at a time. and i stopped. yay! :D

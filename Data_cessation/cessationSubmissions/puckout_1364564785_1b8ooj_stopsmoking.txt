Did I just miss my 1 year no smoking anniversary?

Yes I did! And yes I did it! This is definitely one of the greatest achievements of my entire life (I'm 34). I've been smoking since I was 16 and I want to share the most important step to quitting. You really NEED to want to quit. You can't just say you want to quit half-heartedly. I don't know how else to explain this but deep down inside you, you have to really want to quit and be committed to it. Be prepared for the ups and downs and take it one craving at a time. The downs are gonna hit hard but you can do it. Just look at my badge! Much love, my fellow non-smokers!

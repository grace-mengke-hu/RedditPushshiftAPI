Day 9 and going strong.. except for some things

Haven't touched a cigarette in 9 days. First time in 3 years I've gotten this far. My moods have been out of control this week and I gained 3lbs... well probably only 1.5lbs this week because cravings. I hope my bf (whose been fantastically supportive) doesn't hate me after I'm done quitting =(

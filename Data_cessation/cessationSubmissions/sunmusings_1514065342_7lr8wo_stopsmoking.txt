I just quit smoking five minutes ago....what to do when cravings hit?

Hello this is maybe my fiftieth attempt at quitting cigarettes. I tried all the things multiple times.

Now I am just doing it cold turkey because at least this way I haven't paid more extra money to fail and I will not have added side effects with the failure. (fifth attempt with this strategy.)

What do I do when the cravings hit?

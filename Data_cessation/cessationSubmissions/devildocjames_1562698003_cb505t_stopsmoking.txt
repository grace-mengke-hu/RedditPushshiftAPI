2-3 months, so far, so good.

Just figured I'd brag for a second. Went through a 2 and a half packs of Chantix, until I arbitrarily just stopped smoking. I still have the 6 sticks in the side pocket of the truck.  I dont remember which day it was, but, it was nearly 3 months ago I just stopped.  100%: the Chantix helped me!

I thought it wasn't going to help me totally stop during the first 4 weeks.  Once I acknowledged how it works and used that as a boost for my path to quitting, I was set!

Also, I had been ready to quit, for myself, for a while before I started Chantix.

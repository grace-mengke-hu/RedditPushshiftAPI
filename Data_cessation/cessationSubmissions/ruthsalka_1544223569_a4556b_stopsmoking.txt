complete loss of appetite one month in

Hey there I'm on day 35 and couldn't be happier about quitting BUT... I have had absolutely no appetite for close to a week now. I'm eating small amounts because I know my body needs fuel but have to talk myself into it. My So is cooking a wonderful meal right now and I wish I wanted to eat it..Any thoughts?

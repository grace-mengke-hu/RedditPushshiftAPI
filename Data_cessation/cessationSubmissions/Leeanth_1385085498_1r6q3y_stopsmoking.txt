Cake day, and post-smoking cake day

443 days since I quit smoking, 365 since joining Reddit (although I was a regular lurker for years before that). My 500 day non-smoking milestone will be quite a day as I started at barely 12, quit at 50, without "the book" or other props, and am quite serene about not smoking even though I miss it sometimes...

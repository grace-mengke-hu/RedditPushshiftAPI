Help with the cravings/sleeplessness/headache

So I quit as of almost 48 hours ago and I'm really starting to struggle. I haven't slept right the past two nights. About four hours each night. I also started developing a headache. Should I consider getting a patch? I'm also feeling really depressed and on edge. I hate  how much I rely on this crap, but $140 a month is money best spent elsewhere.

I believe in you....

Come on guys.  I know it's hard.  I know it sucks.  Trust me, I've been there.  I know that feeling where it looks so simple to just give in and say "I can't do it anymore."  But I know you can.  I know it.

Even if you have to tell yourself "maybe I can have one tomorrow" but then when tomorrow comes you say it again, and again, and again.  Whatever it takes to hold you off for just a minute, because in about 5 minutes that craving will be gone.  Just know that the cravings will become farther and farther apart and soon you'll spend days without thinking about smoking at all.  And when you look back, you'll know that you overcame a major obstacle, that you succeeded when most would fail.  

I'm still on this sub because I know how hard it was. And I had people that I had never met encouraging me and giving me hope when I wanted to give in.  Don't worry, you're not alone.  I believe in you.

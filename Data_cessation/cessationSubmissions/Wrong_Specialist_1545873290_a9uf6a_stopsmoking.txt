Ex-smokers come here, please

Im a 23 yo guy who smokes a pack a day.

  
 I'd love to stop smoking, but i can't imagine me hanging with my friends without a cigarette in hands. I mean, i see me as a non smoker at work, non smoker at home but can't see me as a non smoker at an social environment. Is this normal? Will this mindset disappear as i turn in a non smoker? 

When i imagine hanging with friends as a non smoker i almost get a feeling like there's something to be done, something to complete me. that i need to do something.

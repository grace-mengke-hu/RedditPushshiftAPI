After 39 years of smoking, gone over a month without.

Started smoking in 1974 at age 12, now in my early 50's and quit over a month ago.  Quit cold turkey, no ecigs or patches.  

When smokes went to that FSC crap it really turned me off but took a few years to finally stop.

I'm new to reddit too.  Good luck to all!

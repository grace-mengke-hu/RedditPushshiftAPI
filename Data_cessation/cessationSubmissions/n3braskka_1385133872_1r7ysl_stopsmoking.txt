Intense cravings while on ADD medicine.

I am prescribed Focalin, which is a generic kind of Adderall. I usually take 10mg/day, but my doctor said I could take a second dose if needed. Whenever I am taking my ADD meds as prescribed I get very intense cravings to the point that I chain smoke. It's crazy. I have literally smoked so much while on the meds that I made myself sick. 
I was wondering if any one else in this subreddit has experienced the same thing while taking ADD meds.

Over the past 3 days, I have not taken my meds, and I have been smoke free. I am glad to be smoke free, I am starting to feel the effects of not taking my medicine.

Also how do you guys fight cravings?

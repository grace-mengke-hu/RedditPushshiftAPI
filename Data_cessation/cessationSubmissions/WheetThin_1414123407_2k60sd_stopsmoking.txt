Tonight, tonight I am struggling.

I've just made it to the half century mark. It hasn't been easy. Not by any means. However, over the last couple of weeks I occasionally forget that I ever smoked. I only remember that I quit when I see others smoking. I can't remember my last craving. But tonight, tonight I am struggling. I am overwhelmed with schoolwork, I miss my long distance girlfriend, my friends have all moved away, and I just feel sad. I know I don't want to smoke. My head and my heart know it. But I still have that hellish demon poking around in my mind telling me that a cigarette would help. 

Tonight, tonight I am struggling. But tonight, I am still winning.

New to Reddit, desperately trying to quit smoking.

Hey all, I'm giving this attempt my all. I got derailed by drinking and partying this weekend for the Holiday after making it 48 hours cold turkey. I have 4mg lozenges but think that'll only prolong the misery of the withdrawal. Socializing doesn't feel safe for me, and I want complete isolation from the outside world. Is it healthy to go three days avoiding everyone for the sake of detox? How do I deal with my friends who don't understand my need for isolation?  The main friend who doesn't understand lives across the street, and seems offended with the fact I want isolation. I'm taking this attempt very serious and really desire this.

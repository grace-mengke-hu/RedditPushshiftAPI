Quitting cold turkey.

So tonight I've decided to quit. Honestly,  very scared of the next week coming up. I really want to quit, trust me, but I feel as if I won't be able to. I'm glad I found this subreddit though, I feel like I'm not alone, like I have help. I feel like the best way to get past the first week is just to stay away from smoker friends and maybe be to myself, inside my home watching television or something. Any tips on how to get past the first week?

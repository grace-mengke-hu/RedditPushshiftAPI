Almost 3 months... tired

I am approaching the 3 months mark.. but still feel fatigued and apathetic af :( All other physical withdrawal symptoms have subsided (except for occasional headaches), but the struggle with overall exhaustion and feeling lethargic is just too real :( Also been super apathetic :/
Anyone had similar experiences? Any tips and advice are very welcome :)

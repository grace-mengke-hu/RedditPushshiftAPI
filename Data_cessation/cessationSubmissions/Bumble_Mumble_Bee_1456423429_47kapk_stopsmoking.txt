Quit smoking a week ago and doing fine so far!

So last time I had a shot at quitting was 2 years ago and I miserably failed after going at a party and smoking after a few beers... 

This time I decided that I'd quit both drinking alcohol and smoking weed for a time being until I feel like the urges are completely gone and meaningless. I also put 10$-ish in a jar everyday with the plan of buying myself a second guitar and a computer in 357 days !

I feel great and positive about it and I think every smoker deserves help in order to find the optimism necessary to not ''attempt'' to quit but really quit once and for all smoking la cancer sticks!

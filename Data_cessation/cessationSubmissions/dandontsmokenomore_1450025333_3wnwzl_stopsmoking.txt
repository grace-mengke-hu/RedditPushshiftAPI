16 days - feeling the first benefits!

This weekend was so good for me. I exercised for the first time in YEARS.  I accompanied a friend to the pub and had neither cigarettes/alcohol , nor the desire for them. I received a compliment on my skin- something which has not happened in a long time. My sinuses are packed tighter than the rush hour underground and my tongue is still a big sore whale in my mouth  but i am happy.

How do you stop smoking?

Hello redditorsI've been trying to stop smoking for two year. I used to smoke the e-cigarette, but it didn't work. I started again, and again tobacco. It's sad because I'm the kind of person who eats healthy and is concerned about environment.I wish I could stop smoking for ever. Do you have any advice?I smoke 40gr per week which means 15 cigarettes per day

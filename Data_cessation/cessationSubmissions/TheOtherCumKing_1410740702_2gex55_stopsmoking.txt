Relapse

I quit smoking back in May. In fact, I had quit a while back but started in May while on vacation but still managed to quit after getting back home. 

I was clean, going to the gym, feeling relatively better and had no urge to go back. 

However, being frustrated with being unemployed and just being in a general rut in the last couple of weeks resulted in me having cravings now and again. Last night, I got drunk and ended up having a cig. 

24 hours later, I feel like shit. My head hurts, I'm tired and really agitated. The usual stuff. I know I don't want to start smoking again. I still want to get healthier. But there's a part of me thats going through depression  right now due to life things that is telling me that I should indulge in the habit until things get better. 

Logically, I KNOW thats wrong and stupid. I guess I just need to put this out there and try and get through the next 48 hours.

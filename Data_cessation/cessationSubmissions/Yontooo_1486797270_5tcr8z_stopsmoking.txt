Today is the day, I hope

Writing this while I drink my coffee with what hopefully will be the last cigarette. Been a smoker for 8 years. Started with 2 or 3 a week, now it's a pack a day. Started smoking when something bad would happen, then even when something good would happen, then basically when anything would happen. Recently moving to another country, from Italy to China, not the easiest transition, for a new job brought much more stress in my life and smoking is my way to deal with it. 

On another note, my mother is trying to quit too. She's always been a smoker so I think it would be harder for her.  If you have suggestions how to go through this together I would appreciate any input. 

Wish me luck!

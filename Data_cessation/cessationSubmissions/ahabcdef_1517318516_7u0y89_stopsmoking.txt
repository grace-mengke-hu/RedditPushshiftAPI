11th day

Okay so i quit smoking 11 days ago. The first week went great and it felt like a little adventure with all the benefits and everything. Also reading posts in this sub has been a big help!! But this second week has been hard. I get annoyed with EVERYTHING about the most irrelevant stuff. I can’t really get mad at people, because I understand that i’m mad bc i quit smoking so I know its not their fault. But still, every little setback makes me feel like i wanna cry/punch a hole in the wall, I have no patience at all. Has anyone experienced this and do you have any tips?

Romanticizing smoking

Trust me, I'm 100% aware of how ridiculous this sounds. Mentally and physically I'm face palming at the fact that this might be a potential deal breaker for me. But I can't imagine sitting outside at 3 a.m during a bout of insomnia without a cigarette to accompany me, or reading a book without mindlessly chainsmoking. 

None of my friends smoke, so that'll be the easy part. It's those moments of solace and melancholy that really fuck with me. It's like I'm not getting the full experience without it. Those are the reasons I've never lasted more than 3 days without caving and buying a pack. I read the Allen Carr book over a year ago and it really did help, but its effect wore off and I lit up in a moment of weakness. 

I'm also a hypochondriac, so the shortness of breath and general affect on my health is urging me to quit. Does anyone else have this issue? How do I rid of the aesthetic pleasure I've associated smoking with? I really want to be successful this time around, so thanks for any help and advice!!

Also, I'm 22 and have been smoking about a pack a day for around 7 years. Just thought I'd throw that out there.

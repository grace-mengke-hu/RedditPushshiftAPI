Hello! New Reddit user on day 11 :)

I've been reading posts for a few days (as suggested by the 'smoke free' app for iPhone which I'd recommend!) and thought I would finally give in and post something!

I'm at the end of day 11 and going strong! I've had a few wobbles over the past few days (e.g. 'Screw it, if my boyfriend's going to be moody I'll start smoking again') - funny how your mind plays tricks on you like that! I'm proud of myself for tackling those wobbles with logic. Why would I even consider starting again? If you list the pros and cons, there really is no reason to smoke, if you look at it rationally. 

I'm at the point in my life where all of my friends have quit smoking, nobody at my workplace smokes, I'll be wanting to consider having children in the next few years and I'm sooooo fed up of being lectured by the boyfriend and family. So this time I think I have the willpower to keep going. And that feels great :)

I cut down a couple of months ago and got the worst chest infection yet in the process of doing so. The cough stayed for a month and it really scared me! After 10 or so years of smoking it's finally caught up on me! 

So I've quit, and I feel less stressed than when I smoked! I can feel my lungs getting better already, and I feel really relieved as if a massive weight has been lifted :)

I've got 'the book' that you're all raving about on it's way to me in the post. 

Just thought I'd share :D

P.s. FYI I'm using patches and electronic cigarettes

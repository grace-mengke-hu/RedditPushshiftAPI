Vaping while drinking only?

I'm on Day 5.  Woot.  I have always loved to drink alcohol and smoke cigs.  I'm going cold turkey.  But I know once I go out and start drinking with friends that I will want to smoke....Is vaping a good idea to do?  Only while out socially?  I don't want to vape all the time......Anyone have experience with this?

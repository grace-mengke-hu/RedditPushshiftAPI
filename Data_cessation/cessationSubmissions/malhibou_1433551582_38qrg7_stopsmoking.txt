Battling cravings, battling negativity

I'm in a hole. Please remind me that smoking is fucking stupid and my friends are great, because right now it feels like the exact opposite.

Trying to find an interesting or positive spin on how my body and brain are reacting to breaking this habit, but I am just feeling sad and angry and like I've lost a friend.

16 Days! Feel amazing. Good things that I have noticed since quitting...

It's been over 2 weeks now and I feel great. After reading Easyway to Stop Smoking by Allen Carr, I have undertaken what, before, seemed like an impossibility, but now feels like a blessing. I have done it/am doing it, so you can do it too. 

People often post here things that they are struggling with... I am instead using this as an opportunity to embrace what has been good about being free from the disease. 

* My skin colour is great. Before, I seemed very pale, almost looking constantly 'ill' whereas now I feel and look great!
* I've learnt/still learning to live without smoking. As of day 9, I've learnt that I don't need smoking. It is amazing how I went this far without realising how little it does for me. 
* I no longer get cravings. I still get 'urges' but they are very minor, and these can quickly be dispersed by reminding myself that I'd get nothing from it.

Lastly, I feel like I can do literally anything. Smoking comes across to most as something that is impossible to remove from your life. The feeling that I used to get when smoking was one of slavery and hate for myself and the habit. Allen Carr's book is the single greatest non-fiction book I have read. Period. Smoking does NOTHING for ANYONE therefore you are not giving up anything. It is easy. It is relieving, and self inspiring. Go and do it. Anyone can.

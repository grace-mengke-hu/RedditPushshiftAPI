I am quitting. Today.

Hey guys,

My history of smoking is pretty weird. I smoked, then I quit, because I found a girlfriend and I didn't like the fact that she hated my smell. Then we broke up and I started smoking again. Then I quit again. And on Valentines day this year, I smoked "just one cigarette" which led to 30 cigs per day.

Today, I am putting a stop to this. I don't want to smoke anymore. I am not enjoying cigarettes. Smoking was always something that I didn't really enjoy to do, I just felt like I had to do. Well, not anymore. I don't have to do anything. I am refusing to be addicted to anything other than myself. I think of myself as intelligent and smart man, so why should I inprison myself with cigarettes? What's the point? How something so stupid and so dumb can trap me?

Also I really miss the taste of various dishes and I want to enjoy food again. And I want to smell better. And I hate the idea of cancer. Also my hands smell bad and my fingers and fingernails have different colour than usual. It makes me feel gross.

I don't need anything from you, because I don't believe it's gonna be hard. I believe it's gonna be easy as fuck. All I have to do is not smoke again. I have last pack of cigarettes, 13 of them inside. I was planning to smoke them all, but I think I will have the last one, where I say goodbye to this shit and I'll never look back at it.

Okay, in fact, I need something from you: wish me luck.

EDIT: BTW I read the book written by Allen Carr. That shit helped me quit first two times. I finished reading it for the third time few weeks ago, but I'll go back to it today to read it again.

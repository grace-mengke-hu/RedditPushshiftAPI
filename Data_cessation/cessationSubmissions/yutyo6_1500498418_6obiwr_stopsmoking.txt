Im so fucking done with this shit

Ok so, I started smoking around 2 months or so. I don't even know why I did it, probably because I thought it was cool or some shit. I stopped smoking 5 days ago and since then I feel like absolute shit. I suspect it is indeed the withdrawal symptoms, because I did some research and it sounds like it, (nauseated, constant headache, insomnia, flashes of hot and cold, etc). The thing is, I don't really feel any craving for cigarettes. I have finals next Monday, and I can't concentrate for shit. I need to get rid of my current predicament asap.

Anybody got any tips?

EDIT: Forgot to mention, the symptoms have been increasingly stronger these past 2 days

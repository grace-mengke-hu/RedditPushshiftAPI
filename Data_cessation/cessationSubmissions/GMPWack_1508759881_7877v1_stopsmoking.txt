I’m baaaack!! Day one.....again

So I’m trying this again. This time, I got a prescription for Wellbutrin. I’ve been taking that for a week already, and even in that first week “grace period” where you could still smoke, I have noticed that my urges were reduced. I used to smoke close to a pack a day, and suddenly, I found myself only smoking 5 or 6 a day, without feeling anxious, cranky, or constantly feigning. 

Anyway, my lighters......gone. In the trash. Loosie spots.....what loosie spots? ;) 

Hell, while I’m at it, i might as well cut back on my coffee addiction as well. There isn’t enough beans in this world to feed my coffee addiction! Besides, I’ve heard that smokers tend to metabolize caffeine faster than non-smokers. Fact check??

Anyway, let’s do this! One day at a time...

Day one. Been crying all day.

It has been over 24 hours since I've had a smoke. I've been crying all day. I am very far away from home right now but I keep telling myself I will smoke again when the family time is over (2 days). I'm feeling very suicidal and just counting the minutes until I get back home... Please help..

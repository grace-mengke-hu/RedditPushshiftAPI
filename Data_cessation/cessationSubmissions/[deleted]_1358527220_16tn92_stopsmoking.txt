I've known about this subreddit for a while, but haven't been ready.

I'm not totally there yet, but I'm finally starting the process. I've been using e-cigarettes for the past 3 weeks or so and I would first love to hear others' opinions on them. Since I started, I've gone from about 1 1/3 packs a day to 2 cigarettes yesterday. I've been noticing differences in my physical and mental well-being already. Today, I smoked my morning cigarette and will give my last pack and a half to a friend.

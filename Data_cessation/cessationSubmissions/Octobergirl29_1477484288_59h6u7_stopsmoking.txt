One month, one relapse, any advice about relapsing?

Was 3 weeks strong then went on vacation and smoked 2 rolled cigs. It's been 4 days since and I'm back on the wagon but I feel a little defeated because if I hadn't have done that I'd be almost at my one month mark. Saw how easy it would be to slip back in. How do you cope emotionally with relapses? I know I'm being a drama queen but I don't want to let my disappointment in myself weaken my resolve...

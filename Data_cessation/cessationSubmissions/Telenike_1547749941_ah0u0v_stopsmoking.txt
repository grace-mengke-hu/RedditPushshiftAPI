Day 10, Something I wasn't expecting about my quit

Hey all,

I thought I'd throw up my experience with my quit since I was blindsided by the mood changes around quitting and I'd like to give a heads up to anyone who isn't aware. 

First and foremost,  I'm not on NRT. I was on Chantix for 1 month but only committed to my quit 10 days ago and my prescription ran out on day 2. I'm also prone to mild depression and am currently in a weird transitional phase in my education, occupation, and romantic relationship. 

All of this is to say I got hit with a depressive episode around Day 4 that has yet to let up and is among the top 3 most crippling feelings I've ever felt. Coupled with anxiety over my money situation since I need to make some money to make a move to Australia possible (currently in NYC) and I've been laid very low. I have coping strategies that give me moments if respite, but I've yet to pull out of this spin entirely.  

So be prepared if you have mental health issues, my research told me that nicotine causes supernormal amounts of dopamine release and the snap back to average amounts can be extreme.

On the plus side, this has given me an extreme fear of going back to smoking. Knowing that a relapse could mean doing this again and feeling this way again has kept me smoke free.

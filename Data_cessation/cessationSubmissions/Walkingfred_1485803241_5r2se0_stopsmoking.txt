Biggest Triumph to date

I've had my moments of weakness over the past 48 days but I experienced my proudest moment as a non-smoker this weekend. My girlfriends period was late by a couple weeks so we decided it was time to get a pregnancy test. After taking the 2nd test and getting the same positive result, I began to embrace this reality and acknowledge that everything is instantly different. 

Such a huge moment would have made me smoke a cig immediately not only 49 days ago, but my first thought was "I'm so glad I already quit!" It's crazy, instead of wanting one I am now just relieved that I've already stopped and don't have to go through that again. 

I'm pretty damn excited.

I feel sad... and depressed. Will this ever go away?

I still feel sad and depressed.
I do not know how to deal with my emotions.
I feel like I lost my bestfriend I have always had.

I feel so unmotivated and just want to stay in my bed the whole day.
I even called in sick at work yesterday and today, and left early on Tuesday..

I am so low.. I keep on having bad thoughts..
I just want to smoke.. 

It has been over 2 months and I still feel like this..

Will this ever go away..

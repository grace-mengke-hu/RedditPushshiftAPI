Over feeling like this - Day 7

So day 7, and I’m ready to give in. I started off using the patches, but ended up having a bad reaction yesterday morning (day 6) when putting one on, so had to stop using them. Can’t take champix or anything, as it doesn’t agree with me mentally. 

So, I’m now on my own. No NRT. The last 48 hours has been HELL to say the least. I’ve had no physical withdrawal symptoms or anything, but crying like there’s no tomorrow! I can usually control my emotions better than this. I’ve also been wrestling with myself whether or not I should buy smokes, smoke for a while and quit again, but, I haven’t caved yet. I’m loving the way I’m breathing better, and I have more time in the day to do things. 

But this emotional crap is making me feel like I’m a mental patient, and my support person is starting to get irritable because I’m so all over the place, which doesn’t help.

I Have a great Idea on how to quit!!! [NSFW]

Ive tried everything seriously...

I've been smoking since i was 13, Im 21 now and I smoke more then ever.
I used to smoke just about a pack a day. After smoking the blu E-cig for 3 months it felt like I needed nicotine more than ever. Honestly I think I overdid it with that e-cig. After I lost all the batteries I was smoking 2 packs a day. And thats what im currently at now.
I've tried gum, patches, Cold turkey, Jogging. in a few months I will be 2 years since I first tried to quit.

My ingenious plan!! keep in mind i'm 100% serious. I've run out of options. My next step, Gay porn. yes. Gay, Porn. I'm going to bookmark a few gay porns on my phone, And everytime I go on a smoke break I have to watch the porno as im smoking. Maybe, after awhile, it will cause a mental connection with smoking. Hopefully I will start associating gay porn with the cigarette. I need to get to the point where I don't want to see another cigarette. 

good Idea?

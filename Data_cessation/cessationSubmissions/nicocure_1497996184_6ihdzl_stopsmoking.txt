When I see smokers, it feels weird to think I was one of them not long ago. I still occasionally feel the temptation to smoke but the temptation is easy to resist. I smoked in my dream last night and was so relieved when I woke up and realised I was still a non smoker. I don't ever want to go through the initial withdrawal again. That was hell. I am now a non smoker and never taking a puff again.

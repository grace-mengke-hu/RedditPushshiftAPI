I need to stop using NRT

I haven't smoked a cigarette in a little over 2 months now, and I've been using nicotine lozenges religiously. Some days more than others. I tried to stop using the lozenges cold turkey but then I had seriously dangerous cravings for cigarettes so I started using the lozenges again after 3 days because I was terrified of slipping up. Even though I know I don't want to smoke, it was still scary to experience that feeling again. I tried limiting my lozenges use but then I'm just agitated all day with a countdown of how many I can have in my mind. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on quitting NRT?

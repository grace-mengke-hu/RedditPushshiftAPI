About My Flair, and How I Fucked It Up

First time back on this sub in 83 days. You'll see my flair says 153 days. Unfortunately that's not right. 

For the first time since I started smoking, I managed to go a week, two weeks, three weeks, a month, 50 full days without vaping, or smoking, or any kind of nicotine.

I was laying in bed on day 50, when I thought "Man, I miss the flavors of vaping, the feeling it gave me, the sensation of inhalation. Maybe I'll just get a 0 mg, just for the flavor." I had been thinking about it on and off for days, but I resisted up until that point.

Went to the vape shop, wound up getting a 3mg, and fucked the whole thing up. Have been back on vaping since. 

Have been gradually getting back into the mindset I was in my last quit - just wanting to fuckin' quit. The constant battery charging, coil priming, juice buying, anxiety inducing, constant worrying about my health is annoying. The realization that hundreds of times a day I'm inhaling these chemicals and flavoring, and nicotine into my lungs. I keep thinking about in what other circumstance could I possibly convince myself to be breathing chemicals I know nothing about, nearly all day long. I legitimately wonder what percent of the breaths I take are from my vape. Probably a low percent, but also WAY too high. 

Anyway, this is a long winded way to say I'm trying again, and a cautionary tale that you can't let your guard down. Sometimes your mind plays tricks on you, and you can convince yourself it was the greatest thing ever. Take it from me, a guy who went back way after all the nicotine was gone, the moment I took that next puff I knew it wasn't worth it, and that the nostalgia goggles had struck big time.

If you ever feel like you want just another puff, please please please take it from me that it's a trap, and it's not anywhere near as good as you're remembering.

Anybody have difficulty focusing a month or so after they quit?

I'm a student. I have a very difficult time studying and not smoking. I find that studying can be very dull, and cigarettes offer quick rewards on-the-go. As I'd read/write/whatever I would puff along. If cigarettes are, in some way, a cognitive enhancer -- then this is a huge concern for me. I need to kick my semester in high gear -- like, now! but I cannot seem to (perhaps because I'm not smoking). In any case, has anyone else out there noticed these symptoms a month or so after quitting? If so, when can I expect to get my normal, thinking self back? Thanks

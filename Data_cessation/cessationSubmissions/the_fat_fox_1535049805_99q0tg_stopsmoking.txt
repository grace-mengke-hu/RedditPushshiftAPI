3 weeks so far. Depressive thoughts :s

Today I feel so bored and impulsive. I get all these ideas of doing stuff, but I don't have the concentration to finish something what takes longer than 10 minutes. I feel worthless, that I'm my biggest obstacle in life. The biggest trigger for these thoughts is the lack of concentration. Is this recognizable? This is the second time I feel this in my quitting  journey.

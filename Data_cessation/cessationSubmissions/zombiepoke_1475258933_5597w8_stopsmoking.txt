I haven't had a cigarette since last Friday- I have a sleep pattern question for you guys!

So, to be completely fair, I haven't had a cigarette since Friday (one week!) however I have been using an e-cig about 2-3 times a day, though in the beginning I was using it heavily. My goal is to be off all nicotine replacements by next week. 

MY question is this- ever since I quit smoking cigarettes, my sleep patterns have changed. I'm now more tired in the evening. I work a late shift so normally I would get home around 1am-2am and stay up for a few hours, go to bed and wake up around 11am. Now however I've been ready for bed only an hour after coming home, and waking up around 5am wide awake. Usually I force myself to go back to bed because I don't trust that 4-5 hours a sleep a night is good, and I feel convinced that I'll be dead tired around 3-4pm if I wake up around then. 

Has this happened to anyone else?

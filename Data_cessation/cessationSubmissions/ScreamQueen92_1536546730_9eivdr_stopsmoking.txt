On day 2 with NRT patches!

So, on day 2 with the Nicobate 21mg patches. I don’t wear them at night, and I have had no psychical withdrawal symptoms at all. 

I smoked a lot for 14 years, not as much as some, but to the point I had trouble breathing and was spending savings on smokes. 

I’m only 26 so still young and I have a chance to stop the worst happening to me. 

I’m planning on stopping the patches around a month, depending on my what my doctor says, mainly to help with the mental side of things, which is the WORST for me haha. 

I’m hoping this community can help me once I’m off these patches!

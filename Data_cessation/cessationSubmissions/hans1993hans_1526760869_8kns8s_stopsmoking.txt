Just finished my first 10 Mile race

118 days ago I stop smoking and started to train again. I feel so much better than in the last 6 years when I was smoking 1-2 packs a day and did hardly any sport. No I enjoy running and biking again.   The progress I mad in this time is amazing. In the beginning I was hardly able to run for more than  5 minutes without stopping to catch my breath. What was I thinking? Iâ€™m looking forwards to the progress I can make in the next years. I will never touch those cigarettes again!

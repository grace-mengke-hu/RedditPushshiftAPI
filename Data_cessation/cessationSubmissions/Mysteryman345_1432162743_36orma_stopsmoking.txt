Have a goal. It will help!

so out of all the benefits of throwing this habit from hell out, my main motivation for quitting was fitness. i am into soccer and i was concerned about my stamina. 

I also started smoking far too young at 13, and am now 21. This can lead to a phenomenon called *arrested development* on the lungs, where the smoking actually prevents your lungs from growing to maximum capacity. This also contributes to poor stamina.

But today i completed an entire lap of a field near my house without stopping for breath, a 3km run. After several dozen attempts and a few ounces of mucus being spewed up, I finally did it.

I would definitely advise having a fitness goal or something similar in your quits, as you can notice improvement which is motivating, as well as an activity to do instead of smoking. Then that one cigarette will be easy to give up, like a smelly toothbrush

Second day of not smoking, motivated, but have a question

So a little background info. I'm 18, almost 19, and have been smoking cigarettes for 4 years now; a pack every other day. I also like to smoke weed some times a month and would like to continue doing so.

I'm motivated to try and stop smoking cigarettes, but as for weed I enjoy it like some would enjoy a beer, and see no reason to stop smoking it. 

My question is whether any of you been in this same situation, and how did you manage it? Did you have any difficulties smoking weed while trying to stop smoking cigarettes, or did you take a break from weed while overcomming your addiction of nicotine?

Thanks in advance! :)

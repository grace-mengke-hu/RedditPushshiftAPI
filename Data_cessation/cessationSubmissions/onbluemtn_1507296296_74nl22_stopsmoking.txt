I quit because of pregnancy!

I found out I am pregnant on June 29th and I haven't had a cigarette from that day forward! I'm so thankful for this new life and also for the added motivation to quit. My life is so much better without cigarettes. I feel so much freedom not being chained to this addiction! Smoking caused me to feel shame, spend less time with my family, and I never wanted anyone to borrow my car because I was embarrassed about how bad it smelled! I feel so healthy and proud that my children won't know me as a smoker and I won't influence them to think it's okay and normal.

Favorite first week sweets?

I have been allowing myself pretty much whatever I want for the first week, I love all the snacks but I think my go to for cravings is Gummy Worms. It's kinda cigarette shaped and I get to bite the crap out of them, plus it's pretty much pure sugar so keeps me peppy. 

How about everyone else? What is/was your go to junk food?

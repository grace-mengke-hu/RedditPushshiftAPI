Quitting and getting sick?

Hi all! I've been happily quit for over 300 days now but one thing about this year I noticed is...I keep getting sick! I catch whatever colds, etc. are going around.

Anyone else experience this? I realize my body is still in recovery and re-building my immune system.

On the positive front, I also ran a 10k PB (49 mins). Woop!

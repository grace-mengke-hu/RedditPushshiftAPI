Every time I feel it's easy I have a night like tonight and realize it isn't :(

My friend had like ten cigarettes in front of me while we caught up tonight. We had a lovely conversation for hours, ate a nice dinner and drank lots of beers. 

Worst thing is, she used to be my roommate, so I know she's not lying when she says she won't crave a cigarette when she gets up tomorrow morning. It's so difficult to remind myself Im not like her!! For me, a puff equals two packs a day!! I *know* this!! But why on earth do I doubt it sometimes? Why do I childishly feel like it's not fair she can smoke only sometimes while I can never ever smoke again?

This process keeps making me feel like a spoiled six year old, who thinks everything's shit cause I can't have my way with this one thing I really want :(

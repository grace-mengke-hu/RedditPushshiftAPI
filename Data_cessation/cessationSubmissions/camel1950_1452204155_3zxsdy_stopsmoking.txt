Should i smoke joints that have tobacco inside them?

Please don't discriminate me because of it. But i love weed. Twice a week kind of a guy. I'm now in my 6th day of not smoking cigs and its going great with a lot of pain, but lets stick to the topic.

What should i do when my friends invite me to smoke with them, we don't use bowls nor have anywhere to buy them and smoking pure weed joints is too damn expensive for me. The thing that worries/interests me is what kind of an effect will that drop of nicotine i get from a joint have on me. Will it count as a relapse, will it make my abstinance much harder?

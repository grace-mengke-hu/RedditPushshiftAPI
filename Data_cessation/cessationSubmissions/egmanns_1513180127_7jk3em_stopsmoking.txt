Plea for help, Could a NRT spray work?

I keep trying to quit cold turkey and fail. In all honesty i quick smoking actual ciggarettes and started using it with my marijuana only,  this was about 4 weeks ago so im proud ive reduced it and had no actual cigarettes just with the weed,  I never had an issue stopping weed until i started smoking cigarettes.

Cigarettes give me so much anxiety, i hate them but i just cant get this nicotine out. For example i lasted 24hrs yesterday before i actually had a cigarette due to nicotine withdrawals :( first one in 4 weeks. 

So I've never used an NRT, I've read Alan Carrs book and it makes sense but its still so hard. 

My question is would the use of a nicotine spray and using it 2 times a day for a week and then 1 a day for another week help?  Or do they feel like cigarettes ie you have 1 and 2 minutes later you need another?  I don't want to use patches as my total nicotine intake ATM is 4 a day so a patch would increase that amount. 

Thank you for any advise! I really need and appreciate it!

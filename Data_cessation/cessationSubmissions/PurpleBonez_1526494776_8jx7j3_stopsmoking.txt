Pregnant and trying to quit smoking

Hi everyone,

Not proud of this but could definitely use some help/tips.

I found out I was pregnant at 20 weeks (not planned), currently 25 weeks and would like to completely quit smoking. I didnâ€™t tell my doctor because I was ashamed and feel like a idiot now, should have just come clean.

I want to quit cold turkey, is this possible or should I wean myself off? I smoke a pack a day maybe a little more but other days less.

Any help would be great and please no judgement I know this is a terrible situation

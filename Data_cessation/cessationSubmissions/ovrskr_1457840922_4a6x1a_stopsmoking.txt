Thanks guys! 2 weeks in here

I was inspired by the posts here and also some people I met who had quit a few months/years earlier.

Now my buddies also were inspired by this and decided to also quit.
I noticed a lot of subtle changes along the way, it's pretty nice now not to have to stop whatever i'm doing every 20 minutes.

Just one cigarette...

I've been completely smoke free for 32 days. I've been able to stand strong even on stressful days. 

One day I worked from 8 AM to 11 PM, had an unbelievably strong craving around 6 PM, when I felt like I couldn't do anything without having a smoke. 

On a few occasions, I've had to carpool with a smoker, who lit up in front of me before we got into the car, and I could smell the stench of cigarette smoke on the whole ride. 

I was able to handle these kinds of situations and come out on top. 

Today, I decided to watch Alan Carr's easy way to stop smoking video. And for some reason, I feel like smoking that one last cigarette even though I'm already one month smoke free. What's wrong with me?

**EDIT:** I just drank a cup of green tea with honey and I'm fine now :) Funny how these cravings work!

I haven't even set a quit date yet, but I know what my problem will be. Quiet evenings with a toke or a drink. Any ideas?

I have three kids, work two jobs and am going through divorce hell (lawyers, no child support, selling the house, ex inlaws.. oy..)

One thing I look forward to the most is the evenings, when my kiddos are in bed (or at the exs) I sit outside with a drink or a toke and have a few smokes. I have had this habit for probably 13+ years and I have no idea what to do. 

The funny thing is, if I go out with friends on these evenings I don't even get a craving. It's just when I'm alone and comfortable and quiet. It's not realistic for me to go out every evening. Any wisdom you brave people can share?

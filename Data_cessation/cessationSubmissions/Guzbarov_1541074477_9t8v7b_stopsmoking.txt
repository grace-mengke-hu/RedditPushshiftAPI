Day 4: Tips &amp; Tricks, withdrawal effects, smoke free app

Its my 4th day of not smoking and it's been easier than i imagined. I gradually cut down on cigarettes for a month before i completely stopped and that helped a lot. 

The smoke free app sends you to this subreddit on day 4 to see what other people are going through and it hought i'd share my best solution to deal with cravings. 

So i realized that smoking for me (in most situations) isn't about actually getting the nikotine, but a lot of different reasons. I started categorizing these reasons and finding solutions for those

Habit: After food, waiting for the bus, after sex, when you leave the office. All those are situations where I'm bbasically just smoking because I'm used to it. I tried cutting these habit cigarettes off in the month before i quit. So I'm not used to them, anymore and i'm not actually missing them at all. (except the ones after dinner -.-) 

Breakfree: Idk how to descirbe these but its basically all those when your at work and you need a second for yourself, or when youre at home and bored and smoking kind of switches things up, or when youre stressed and need one to calm down. All these are similar because you stop doing what youre actually doing and change surroundings and so on. I found it really helpful to actually still go outside for a couple minutes. But without the cigarette. Just breathe in the fresh air. You will be much more focused and calm afterwards. Trust me. TRY IT!!! Works wonders.

About the withdrawal effects: 

According to the app there is no nicotine left in my body. And i can really feel how I'm getting more irritable and it's getting harder to concentrate. I'm also having a super annpying cough wich i heard is quite normal because my lungs are regenerating. I think all of those are normal.  I have really strong cravings about 5 times a day i would say, and get jealous every time i see someone else smoking. I'm trying to convince myself to believe that I'm better than them because i made it and i dont need it anymore, but I'm not there yet haha. One step at a time.

So yeah these are the things that help me. (Plus seeing how much money i already saved and how my energy levels are getting better.) But I'm also in a good situation right now, where i'm able to distract myslef from any cravings and I'm also not surrounded by other smokers. I'm kind of scared about going back to my hometown where all of my friends smoke. It's going to be so hard to not pick it up again when we're all together.

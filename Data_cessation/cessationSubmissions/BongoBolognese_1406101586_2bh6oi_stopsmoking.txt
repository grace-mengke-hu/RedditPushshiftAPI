When does the battle become more passive?

After 13 years of smoking, I am now smoke-free for 17 days and I wonder when the battle will become more passive. What I mean is, right now I experience cravings and I have to actively remind myself why I quit and why smoking is no longer an option for me. I know that this phase will last a lot longer than 17 days as you can't just shrug off 13 years of building a habit.

However, to those of you that have quit much longer ago, when will my mind fight the cravings for me in auto-mode? When will be the day where I can get out with friends, having beers and don't have to remind myself every 30 minutes that I may not smoke under any circumstances? Does it take half a year? One year? Five years?

I am aware that it's never really over and that you have to be careful your whole life so that you do not relapse. I don't want to know when it's over but when the phase of actively fighting the habit is over.

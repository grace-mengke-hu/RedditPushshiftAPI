First milestone!

I woke up this morning and didn't smoke. I am one of those people who smoke within 5 minutes of waking up. I've never been even close to successful with a "morning quit" because I feel crazy if I don't get at least one in the morning. And it doesn't feel as bad as I thought it would! 

I am more than 8 hours smoke free already!

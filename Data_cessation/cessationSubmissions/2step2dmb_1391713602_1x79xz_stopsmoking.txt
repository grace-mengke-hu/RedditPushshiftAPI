What can I do to help her stop smoking?

Be kind here as I've never smoked a day in my life and I don't know what it's like to be addicted. 

She knows I can't stand it and I've never been okay with it. I don't know how much she smokes because she won't smoke in front or around me, but what can I do to help her stop? She's tried to stop in the past, but has never been successful. I think her smoking has lessened since living with me (three months) but it still disappoints me on a daily basis.

Anytime we have an argument or misunderstanding, she immediately runs to the store to buy a new pack. Today she overdrew our account from her $5.93 purchase. I can't take it anymore, but I don't know what I can do to help her stop.

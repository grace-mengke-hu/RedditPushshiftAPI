Dreams....

Hi everyone, 

Question. Are strange dreams, not being able to sleep,  that jerking motion as you're just falling off to sleep a normal part of the detox?
I've been sleeping really badly. 
I quit smoking and drinking and am wondering....and will xpost in both subs...

Anyone else have sleep issues once you quit?

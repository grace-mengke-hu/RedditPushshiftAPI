Been gradually cutting down (only been on one/two a day for the past couple of weeks) but after stopping yesterday I feel really weird.

I kind of assumed that the withdrawal wouldn't be so bad if I gradually cut down. Despite this, I'm sitting here feeling woozy with a headache and craving a damned smoke. I'm feeling confident that I can get through this (I've started to really, really hate smoking) but I'm just a bit confused as to why I feel this shit.

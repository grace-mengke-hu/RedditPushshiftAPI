Stop smoking E-book

333 days ago I quit smoking and it feels awesome! It's great to see so many of you reporting similar successes!

I always wondered why some people are able to quit while others keep trying and trying without any success and also why my previous attempts were no success.

I realized that there are some key factors that played a major role in finally quitting. Because I really want to share these things and help others to quit smoking as well, I decided to write a book. 

I started a few weeks ago and I think I'm about half way there for the first draft. 

I'm looking for people who like to proofread the book when it's finished and who are willing to give their opinion about the book. I'd like to hear about the stuff you like and find useful about the book, but also about the things you don't like or that you're missing. 

Your feedback can help to take the book to the next level and to help others quit their smoking habit. 

If you'd like to help me, please contact me at stopsmokingebook2015@gmail.com or send me a PM here.

Also, if you would just like to receive a free copy once the book is officially released, let me know! I'd be happy to send you one. :)

Thanks!

It has been 6+ Months!!!

I just wanted to say to all the people trying that it is possible to quit. I tried and failed 100s of times, but over 6 months ago, I finally put down the cancer sticks for good. That first week was hell, and smoking was all I thought about. It does get easier though. I rarely think about cigarettes anymore. They smell disgusting to me, and my health has improved noticeably. I will never go back to smoking. 

You can do it too! Just make up your mind and stick with it.

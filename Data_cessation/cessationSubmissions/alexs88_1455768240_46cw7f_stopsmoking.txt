Hey Quitters! Ever randomly smell smoke?

Hey guys!

I'm on month 3 of quitting, feeling a lot better, and wishing you all the best in your journeys :)

Once every week or so, at random times (usually at night), I'll randomly smell smoke for like 5 or 10 minutes, and it'll go away.

It doesn't smell exactly like cigarette smoke.  If I had to describe the smell, it's similar to a damp sweater worn by a smoker.  Muffled but strong.

I can tell it's not something external but something internal because it smells the same every time, and lingers wherever I go.  Happens at my house, parents house, car, outdoors, etc.

Anyone ever have this during their quit?  I assume it may be tar/gunk from the nasal passages?  Or maybe my brain is always used to smoking at this time?

Thanks and good stuff everyone!

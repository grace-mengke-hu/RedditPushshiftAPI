Cigarette Smell

Hi all! I quit smoking on November 1st and haven't touched it since. I was a smoker since I was 18 and smoked around a pack a day of Marlboro reds, then Marlboro lights and then Yellow American Spirits. I'm 28 now. 

I gained around 40ibs since I quit but finally trying to get healthy again. 

My problem is that the scent really really bothers me now. It didn't bother me up to like two months ago but I've noticed recently it really bothers me. If a smoker says hello to me and comes to hug me I'm like gagging, if someone is smoking outside and it comes towards me I'm gagging, and also if it's on someone's clothes I can't stand it. How do you guys deal with it? It's giving me migraines. I'm going to greece next month and everyone smokes there, all of my friends, all of my family, and all of the people. This was never a problem going before cause I was also a smoker but I fear now I won't be able to even sit outside at a coffee lounge and enjoy a nice coffee. Any suggestions/ideas/tips or anything that worked for anyone else?

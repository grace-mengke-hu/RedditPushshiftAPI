My first healthy week: impressions

The worst has already gone away. The first 5 days were awful, but strong cravings are still there. I used to smoke around 20 or 30 cigs a day for almost 8 years, and I had already stopped smoking a couple of times. Last time I stopped smoking for 2 months. Then I smoked a cig in a party, along with alcohol: "it's only one" I thought. 

You can imagine the rest.

I had a terrible cold and throat infection 2 weeks ago, so I thought: "Why don't you try stoping again?". So I'm a week in already. I want to believe this time is the LAST time I stop smoking this poison, that's why I've decided to participate in this subreddit. Whenever I have a huge craving, I log in and read, and shortly afterwards, I feel better :)

Impressions: From day 5 on, my triggers are always related to habits. For example: After a coffee, I used to smoke a cig or two. Now my mind is confused. "Where's your cig?" asks me. I chew gum instead, but it's very hard. After dinner is a very tough time too. I used to smoke more at night-time.

I try not to think too much about it, but sometimes it's impossible. Now I'm craving for it so much...But this time I'm gonna succeed!

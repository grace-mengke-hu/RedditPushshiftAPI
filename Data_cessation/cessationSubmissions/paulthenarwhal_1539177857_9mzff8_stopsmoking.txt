6 months deep. Sudden and unprecedented urges to smoke.

I’ve been trying to give up other vices recently. Been without tobacco for over 6 months. Trying to kick other unhealthy habits like booze. Suddenly I feel the strongest urge to smoke and I can’t describe why. I won’t but it’s been really very hard.

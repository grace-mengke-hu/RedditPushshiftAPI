Today starts my first serious attempt.

My wife and I found out that she was pregnant last week, so in order to get her to stop cold turkey, I told her I would join her. I'm 20 years old and in the Air Force, and I've been smoking for 8 years. It just seems daunting, I mean cigarettes are what I grew up with, every time I had a problem growing up, I'd go smoke and feel better. Anyways, tomorrow begins Day 1, wish me luck.

Smoked 2-3 packs a day for 33 years

 Today makes 2 years and 3 months without a cigarette.

 Anyone who wants to quit, use whatever resources you have available. Family, friends, this forum. Drink water, chew gum, suck on toothpicks.

 You muscle memory may have you reaching for a smoke during or after certain events. You might be someone who had a smoke right after dinner. Start doing something else. It might take a month or longer but you eventually stop reaching for that smoke.

 I smoked all the time, I was constantly reaching for a pack of cigarettes. I started keeping a bottle of iced water around. Everytime I reached for a smoke, I took a couple sips of water instead. Try a few things and do what works for you.

 Good luck.

They say everything comes with a price

and mine costs lung infection, flu, sore throat, coughing almost every minute and dizziness. I got both quitter's and "normal" flu. I'm on day 13 and didn't receive any support from friend and family. They are all like "heeey, come with us, look at this, look at that, hear this one" and I'm like "I got and exam on Tuesday and all I see are the flames where I'll burn if I don't pass".
To me these are the best days of my life.

I'd also like to say that this price is very small compared to what other people may have to go through because of smoking. But I payed only this because I'm quitting. If anyone reading is still smoking, please, quit. Your life is precious, don't waste it, don't think you're special and nothing bad will happen to you...because when you'll hit reality again it'll be too late.

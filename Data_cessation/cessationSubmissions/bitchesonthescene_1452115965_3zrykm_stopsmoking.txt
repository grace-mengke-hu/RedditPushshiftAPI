SO is on day 1 of quitting after several attempts. How can I help him?

Hi! I've been a non-smoker since early October 2015 due to falling pregnant. So far quitting hasn't been difficult for me, though it has been in the past. In fact I used to come to this sub a lot in the beginning of 2014 (on a different username) and found it very helpful...until my SO tried to quit 3-4 months after I did and we relapsed together. 

ANYWAY, with baby on the way, SO was supposed to quit along with me but slipped up a number of times (sometimes doing so behind my back, which was awful!). Now he's trying to quit again because he knows he ABSOLUTELY MUST QUIT by the time the baby is here in June. Every time he tries to quit it is a total nightmare. His anxiety goes through the roof and he feels as though the world is crashing down around him. He talks about quitting his job, sleeping for weeks at a time, dying, etc. You can only tell someone "It'll be okay! You'll get through it!" so many times, and let's be honest, it doesn't really help him. 

What can I do, if anything, to ease his stress? I'm already a mess from being pregnant (the nausea is CONSTANT) and he's been taking such good care of me, but now I know he won't be able to because he's dealing with his own strife in trying to quit smoking. I'm afraid we'll both fall to pieces if I don't figure something out to support him besides verbal encouragement. Any ideas?

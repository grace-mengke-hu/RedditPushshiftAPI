It's been almost 2 months, again... the cravings are really starting to get to me...

And I really don't know what to do... I can't get the thought of going to the gas station, and buying my Marlboro Skyline 100s... it sound like the best thing in the world. Nothing can compare to it. 

I have this tiny voice saying don't, and a huge voice (with a megaphone) yelling at me to go buy a pack... 

Edit: I would like to say thank you to everyone! You guys have really helped me, and I really appreciate you!

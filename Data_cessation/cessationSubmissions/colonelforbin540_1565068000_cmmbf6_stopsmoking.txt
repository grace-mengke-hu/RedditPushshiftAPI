10 months smoke free, 2 days Nicorette free, all died the fucking drain. I'm decently drunk right now and just stole one of my wifes cigarettes while she was asleep. I feel awful.

Didnt think i was going to relapse like this. I'm going to try to stop myself from buying more gum, but i don't want go back to smoking. I'll keep chewing this shit everyday if I keeps me from putting garbage in my lungs. GO COLD TURKEY. Don't become me.

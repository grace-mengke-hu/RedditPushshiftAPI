Scariest thing, but to my relief

I quit smoking almost a month ago because of fears of COPD, my dad has it, he's 85, and it's killing him - I have to take care of him every day, he lives with me, wakes up at night, coughs, and wakes up tired because he was up all night coughing.

I quit smoking, and developed wheezing soon after, and chest pains.
Guys let me tell you - this will scare the SHIT out of you!

I went to the doctor after feeling this for weeks, turns out I have GERD (acid reflux) But let me tell you, I now have the fear instilled in me.
One day if you DO smoke, you will probably have to deal with pain somewhere, and breathing issues. You will be afraid of talking to a doctor because you'll expect the worst, and you'll know why if you GET the worst.
I'm lucky.

I took the X-Ray, and ECG - My heart, and lungs are clear. I did NOT expect that. 
I never want to feel that fear ever again in my life, I'm never picking up another cigarette.

Edit: For the record, GERD causes chest pains, and wheezing, and shortness of breath sometimes. It's an easy fix, I just take an antacid, and it's gone.

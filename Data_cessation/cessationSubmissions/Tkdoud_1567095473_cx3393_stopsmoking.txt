It's the dawn of the 5th day!

In theee hours I will officially be nicotine free for 5 days. It wasn't easy getting here but I'm glad to have made it this far. Cravings are hard but I've been munching on sunflower seeds and vegetables to keep everything occupied. I can't wait to see how much better everything else can get!

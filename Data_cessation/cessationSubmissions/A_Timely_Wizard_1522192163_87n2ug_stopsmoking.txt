Something I find helpful

Hi, I know I look small time to some of you, but I was on six months. I had a minor set back and thought it only fair to reset.

Anyway, something I did in those six months is keep my inhaler in the same pocket I used to keep my tobacco in. It really cements the idea that you're making a change for the better. Now instead of reaching in to your pocket and thinking "damn, no cigarettes" hopefully you'll think "oh that's right, I enjoy breathing."

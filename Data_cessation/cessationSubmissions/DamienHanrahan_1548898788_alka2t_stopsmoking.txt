I just went out for dinner and heavy drinking with my best friend, who I started smoking with and have smoked alongside for years since. 2 days in amd I refused a smoke, and my evening was as enjoyable as ever.

Smoking does not provide one single advantage to mirror the numerous disadvantages. Smoking does nothing for you.

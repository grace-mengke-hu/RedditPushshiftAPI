Here we go again.

So, like the rest of us, I've been here before. I've been a member on this sub before, I've told myself this is it, no more, last one etc etc. All I know is I'm giving it another go. 

I'm a 25 year old male and the reason I've decided to stop is because, for the first time ever, I can really feel the damage smoking has done to me (been smoking since 14/15). My lungs feel like shit, I can't catch a breath, I can hardly walk up my stairs without panting and I wake up in the morning hacking up gunk. I just hope I haven't done myself anything permanent. 

I guess hitting 25 (in my head a big milestone, I've now lived about 1/3rd of my average lifespan) really drove home for me the fact that I am not immortal, and that cigarettes are actively killing me one at a time.

As it's been a week since my last fag, I've gone through the worst of the physical withdrawal (not fun) and have put down one night with friends and beers smoke free (honestly not as tough as I thought). So two major milestones, for me at least. 

Basically what I'm saying is, I'm here again, another hopeless addict trying to beat the excuses and the shitty lies we all tell to justify "just the one" to ourselves. Good luck and thanks to anyone who reads this, feel free to message me any of you who might want a chat or a bit of support!

Friend told me of a crazy remedy to "sweat" out nicotine, and I think it's been working?

I fucked up my last quit, but I'm starting again.

Friend told me that taking baths with ginger powder in it can increase your circulation and make you sweat a whole bunch. And whoa - do you SWEAT! I work out during the day but at night this is great. Also relaxes the body and calms me before bed (nighttime is especially hard with quitting, I've found)

Hopefully this will help you in some way, because it's helped me.

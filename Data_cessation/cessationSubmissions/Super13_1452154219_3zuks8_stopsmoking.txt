Mum is quitting with patches today, from around 12 per day. What can she expect?

Hello there,
  My mum today bought some patches and is trying to quit.  Day one today.   I want to support her, make sure I can help when I think she may have the hardest time.  She's bad at talking about well being/emotion etc.  She's always "good" so I'm hoping to get an idea of what she'll be going through. Is there any particularly hard time with patches, out is it ask pretty smooth sailing?  
I think 10 a day sounds light, but being a non smoker don't have much of a gauge of this.  Thank you all in advance, and good luck to you all in your own challenges.

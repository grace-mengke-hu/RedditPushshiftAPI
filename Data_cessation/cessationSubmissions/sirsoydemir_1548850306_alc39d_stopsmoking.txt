Day 60# I have calculated the length of tobacco rolls I did not smoked since I quit.

It is approx. 76.4 meters.

Each roll is \~8cm. (I think, I don't actually remember that much. hooray for that!)

I have not smoked 955 cigarettes.

955 \* 8 = 7640cm =76.4m.

That approximately equals to 3 times a short course sized olympic swimming pool.

Wow...

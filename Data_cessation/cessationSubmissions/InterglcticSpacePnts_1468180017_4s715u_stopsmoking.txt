Relapse after 16 days. GUILT.

I smoked 3 cigs in a day after having a reAlly successful 16 day quit. I felt so much shame and guilt and really just felt super disappointed in myself and my willpower after I smoked. It was the worst and a feeling I definitely don't want to have again. There was no reason that I smoked...I just did. The excuse doesn't matter. Just so much guilt and shame. I don't ever want to feel that way again. I am in control of my success here. Day 2, once again. I've never felt determined like I do in this moment. Just needed to get that off my chest. N.O.P.E--Not One Puff Ever.

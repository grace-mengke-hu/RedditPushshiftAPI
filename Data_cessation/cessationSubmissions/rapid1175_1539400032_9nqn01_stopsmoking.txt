How to stay focused?

First day of quitting and I’ve got quite a bit of study I need to complete with exams coming up, however  struggling with keeping focused &amp; my mind keeps slipping to cigarettes. 

It’s been almost 14 hours since my last cigarette. How can I stop thinking about the cravings and focus on my study?

First time in 10 years I woke up without wanting a cigarette.

My morning cigarette was the best. It was a good start of the day and defo one of the hardest ones to not smoke (together with the one after dinner).  This morning I woke up and a cigarette wasn't the first thing on my mind.
I don't need those anymore. It's getting so much easier!
I quit smoking, vaping and weed and I'm finally coming out at the other end where it gets easier and more comfortable.
Made me happy!

It’s day 7 and I don’t want to smoke a cigarette, I just don’t want to feel like this any longer.

I’m not entirely sure if this is normal, but today is day 7, and I’ve spent the past week going from being extremely hyper and irritable (frantically scrubbing the interior of my car with a toothbrush kind of hyper), to exhausted and depressed. Today I absolutely don’t want to get out of bed. I don’t want to cook. I don’t want to watch TV. I don’t want to go for a walk or play with my dog. I just want to pull the covers over my head, wish this headache and these cravings away, and sleep until I feel better. 

Is depression something people typically experience while quitting? I get the anxiety... but this is not something I’ve experienced and I’ve quit a few times before, though never cold turkey for this long.

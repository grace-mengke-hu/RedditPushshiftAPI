Do you find that people who still smoke are the most critical of your success in quitting?

Maybe it's just my friends and coworkers?

I had been smoke free for 2 years, but started up again. I made the decision to quit again, and have been doing pretty well. 
I get lots of support from people who *don't* smoke. 

But from people who still smoke? I have gotten so much negativity:

* "You'll be back, just like last time..."

* "come on, it's smoke break, just come have one with me!!?"

* "You'll never really quit... and even if you do, you will **always** want to smoke again"

It's hard enough already, but to have a friend tempting me to smoke more. It's a test of my willpower. 

Anyone else dealing with haters?

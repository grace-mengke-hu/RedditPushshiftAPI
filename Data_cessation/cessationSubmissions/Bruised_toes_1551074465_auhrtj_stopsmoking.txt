I need to quit.

I'm only 21, I've been smoking since I was 14. I need help quitting. I dont know where to start or even what to do. I've tried a vape, throwing them out, cutting down one cigarette a day and it just hasnt worked. I live in a house of smokers and that doesnt help a single bit. To add they smoke in the house and it always gets me. Any advice or suggestions would be so great.

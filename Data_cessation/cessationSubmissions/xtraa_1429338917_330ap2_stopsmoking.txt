TIL; The Real Enemy Is Called Nornicotine (Must Read For Every Quitter)

We know that technically we are clean from Nicotine after some 48 hours of nonsmoking and we blame the rest of our cravings on the psychic- and mind-trained effects we learned over the years. This is all true but why are so many smokers start again after three, six or even nine  month of non smoking?

Perhaps you've heard about Nornicotine. This little bitch hides in your liver, comes out every two to three months and gives you a feeling as if you just smoked a cig. Even after months of nonsmoking. This leads to very dangerous cravings "out of the blue" even after months that will last for 1 to 3 days — so be prepared!!

Nornicotine is responsible for keeping ex-smokers hooked — even after nine months it can keep you carving from time to time. Also, it does bad stuff to a huge number of body-enzymes, and new studies are pointing in the suspicion that it could be the most carcinogen fallout of tobacco. 

**//edit:** 

I have found some pages in german, but not as much as expected. While the forums and discussions are full with postings, there is barely a source. But here are some scientific documents from trustful sources (scripps, pnas, aspet) in english and studies for research. Some of them are showing that Nornictine is not only carcinogen, but can also be responsible for getting Alzheimer, Arteriosclerosis and Diabetes — and that is just what we know so far.

> 'From the blood samples, the researchers concluded also that Nornikotin could be the cloth makes the smoker  hooked. While nicotine workings quickly, Nornikotin could prove even after some time even in the blood of smokers, the US team reported.'

After all what I read so far, it seems that there is a lot of research to do — but Noradrenaline is a bad mofo —  causing some of the worst diseases, changing proteins and enzymes by making them producing toxines and after all according to some scientists in the first article seems to stay longer in the body and can keep us hooked.

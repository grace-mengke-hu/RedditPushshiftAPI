Gul Dukat and the Two Week Itch.

Hello. This is my second time quitting and my first time posting here. Starting on the third day and continuing infrequently since then I have been having dreams occasionally where I am smoking a cigarette and I wake up and am horrified. The dream goes on like normal after the cigarette and in the dream I was not feeling any sense that I was doing something wrong. 

I have been watching a lot of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine recently and last night Gul Dukat offered me a cigarette in my dreams. I refused the kind Cardassian's offer and responded with: "I don't smoke, thanks."

Anyone else have vivid dreams about smoking?

For the last time...

I have quit smoking before for over a year. Then I started. And quit. And started. And quit. I've been off and on for over six months now. Every time I start again I tell myself the lie that I can be an occasional smoker. This is just not true for me.

I'm tired of smelling bad. I'm 40 years old and on the pill, so I'm risking death. I want to smell the world again. I want to taste food again. I want to be able to breathe. I'm ready to quit coughing up shit every day. 

Tomorrow I quit for the final time. I'm going to use the hell out of you guys to do it.

Thanks for being here. Glad I found this sub.

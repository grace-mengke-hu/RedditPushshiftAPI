Starting off on what is probably going to be a long and unpleasant journey.

I took up smoking quite late in life, but for the last 8 years I've not gone so much as a day without smoking. I woke up this morning all out of rolling papers, so I  thought "Fuck it, as good a time as any" then chucked out my tobacco.

So far I've made it 15 hours without a cigarette. I suffer from anxiety and had been using fags as a crutch, but I think I'm ready to face the reality that they do more harm than good.

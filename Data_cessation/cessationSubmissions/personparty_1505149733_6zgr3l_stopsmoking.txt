My crazy one-year coincidence

So in a couple of days, I will officially be one year off the cigs. I am ftm (female-to-male) transgender and one of my biggest transition goals was to get top surgery (getting my man titties taken off). When I first started researching the surgery, I discovered that some surgeons will not operate if you are a smoker. That's when I realized I care way more about my transition than smoking. So I quit. In a couple days, September 15th, I will be going into surgery and by pure coincidence it's the same day I stopped smoking one year ago. Didn't plan it that way, it was literally the first day my surgeon was available. I am so proud of myself, both for quitting and for transitioning. Substance abuse is a big problem in the trans community, nicotine included, so I'm proud that I was able to quit in order to do what I had to do to be happy, even though it was a strong coping mechanism and social lubricant. 

Thanks for reading. Cheers to my fellow non smokers.

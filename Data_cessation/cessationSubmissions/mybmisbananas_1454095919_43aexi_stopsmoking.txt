Bought the patch!

Hey everyone! 

I just wanted to say I bought the patch today. I put it on at 9:30am and its 1:30pm and I haven't even thought about smoking..... 

Okay, that's a lie, I thought about it. But it was like I was convincing myself to have a smoke. But I had no desire to have one! I'm so proud of myself. I'm so thankful to this community for helping me on this journey!

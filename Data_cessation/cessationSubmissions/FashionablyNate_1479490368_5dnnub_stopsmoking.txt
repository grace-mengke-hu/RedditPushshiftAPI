2 Weeks, I didn't think it was possible...

I was able to do this with support from my family, chewing gum, drinking lots of water, and isolating myself from my smoker friends. It's really strange how after about a week the smell grosses me out again. Keep at it guys! The first 5 days are by far the hardest, but it is so worth it! I can breathe better, I don't smell anymore, and I feel like I'm more in control in general

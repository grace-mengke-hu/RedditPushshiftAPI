The worst withdrawal.

I kept trying to sleep for good 3 hours last night but a very sharp headache + my shivering right arm wouldn't let me. I was going through the worst, literally the WORST withdrawals I've ever gone in my life. All this time I thought it was a psychological effect but I suppose my last night experience busted that myth considering my arm+shoulder kept shivering like a maniac. Can you guys explain why that happened and also how to stop that from recurring again?

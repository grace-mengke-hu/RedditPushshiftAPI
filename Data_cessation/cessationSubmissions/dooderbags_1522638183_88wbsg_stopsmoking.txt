Something feels different this time...

So I have *actively* been trying to quit for about a month and a half now. Actively as in - not just telling my friends and family that I’m quitting or planning on quitting or pretending to try to quit.

The first month was awful. Every single day I would go to work I would think about smoking constantly and find myself smoking the accidental cigarette from the accidental pack I bought while getting an energy drink at the store. 

A little background information: I don’t smoke at home. Never have. Being more of a habit then an addiction my strategy for stopping has always been to make it to the weekend and then I would hopefully purge the cravings in a safe place. At work however, minimum pack a day. 

This last go around has been a breeze. Since I’ve been really pushing to get these things out of my life I’ve felt like every mistake has been a punch in the gut. I’ve been disappointing people since I started these things, but I think I’ve finally got myself in the place where I’m legitimately disappointed in myself when I smoke. I haven’t even craved a cigarette since I got off work on my Friday a week and half ago. My best friend still smokes. And he smokes around me. Doesn’t phase me. 

Occasionally I think about cigarettes. But it’s usually like “huh, what should I do with all this time I usually filled with cigarettes.” Or “wow, my truck doesn’t smell like cigarettes”

Has anybody else experienced this weird cleansing sense of conviction?

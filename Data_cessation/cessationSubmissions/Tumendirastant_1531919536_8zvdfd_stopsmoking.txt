Last two days

Hello everyone. I’m a 34 old French guy, lurker for a long time and I’ve seen how great a community this sub is. 
I smoke since I’m 17, a pack a day. I’ve always loved it, the act of smoking, the gesture, the smoke. But lately, for a couple of months, I’ve felt so shitty because of it. I feel that my life only revolve around it. I do things, i plan things, considering when and whether I’ll be able to smoke. I feel tired all the time, especially in the morning. I can’t focus as i did before. And i don’t do any sports in spite of the fact that I’ve always run until now.
I have a two year old boy, and i hate smoking when he’s there, knowing that he can smell it. I will start a new job on august 23 and i don’t want to be a smoker there. I want to arrive sharp and focus. 
For all those reason, i want to stop. And i plan it for Friday night. I’m motivated, really, but to be honest, I’m scared as shit. I’ve experienced the night fevers, the nervosity. Worst, i feel like i can never be able to enjoy a moment without a cigarette. I know it’s fake, but that’s really how i feel and i hate it.

That’s why I post this. To share and it feels good. And to have support and keep being motivated. Reading all your posts and comments had been a real help to decide to make that decision. All your advices are welcome and I’ll keep you posted on my progress.

Thanks to you all

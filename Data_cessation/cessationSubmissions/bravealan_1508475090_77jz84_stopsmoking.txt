I stopped, and you can too. There’s really nothing to it!

So around March time (I think) - I stopped smoking.

I read the Alan Carr book, and it was the best decision I ever made. Quite simply, just read it, and stop.

I don’t actually remember what the date was, because I really don’t think counting the days is helpful or relevant. I just don’t smoke anymore. If I was to count the days, it’s almost praising myself for getting this far, when actually, this should be normal and not noteworthy at all. But whatever works for you is good with me!

Stopping for me was literally no issue, and now I feel ridiculous for the 6 odd years I smoked.

You can quit, it’s really that simple. Just try it, it doesn’t hurt, nothing bad will happen, just do whatever you normally do with your day, and soon, you won’t even think about it!

Also, thanks to everybody on this sub, it’s a great community!

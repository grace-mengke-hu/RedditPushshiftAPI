Missed my one-year anniversary.

I was traveling all day on Monday, which was the one-year anniversary of my quit, and it came and went without me even noticing. 

It's perhaps most noteworthy because a year ago, I couldn't have done what I did on Monday. I had two flights canceled, and I ended up waiting in O'Hare for over seven hours waiting for my connection. As awful as that was, it's a testament to my quit that of all of the issues I was having, it never even occurred to me to want a cigarette. Once I realized that, my mind flashed back to the past, when I would sit inside the smokers' terrarium at the airports that had them, or - even worse - *leave the airport and* *go back through security* just so I could smoke a cigarette. Yeesh.

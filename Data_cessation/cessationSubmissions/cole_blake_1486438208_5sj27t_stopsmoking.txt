My advice if you want to quit

Thats just it, if you want to quit you have to want to. Understand the benefits and reasons youre quitting for, do some research and read up on quitting smoking, talk to people about it, download an app if youre on your phone alot like myself haha...

Im on day 5, ive already faced many cravings to smoke, but ive come to realize that the fear of quitting is worse than the actual withdrawals, ten-fold. Your mind will fix itself and you will come to realize that you wont even be able to understand why you smoked in the first place, let alone even stand to be around a smoker. 

It will change your life bigtime, make the commitment and good luck.

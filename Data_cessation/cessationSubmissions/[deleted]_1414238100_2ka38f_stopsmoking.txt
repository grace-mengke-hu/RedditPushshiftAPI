My 16 year old friend smokes and she knows she's going to get cancer from it but she still does it.

I recently got in contact with a friend of who I haven't seen since 2 years ago and I found her smoking a cigarette when I was hanging out with her and her friends. When I asked her when she started doing it, she told me that she started this summer(Summer 2014). When I mention cancer to her, she tells me she knows about it and she tells me that she'll keep smoking. I'm not sure whether to not get involved or intervene with this matter(Contact her parents, call the police, etc.) I've talked with my father about this and he tells me to not get involved because it's someone else's business and not mine. But at the same time, I feel that something needs to be done because the matter of the fact is that this is a 16 year old that is going to die soon. This isn't the first time I've seen her with issues since 2 years ago, I saw that she was a cutter due to her depression.

tl;dr: 16 year old girl I know smokes and I don't know whether to get involved or not.

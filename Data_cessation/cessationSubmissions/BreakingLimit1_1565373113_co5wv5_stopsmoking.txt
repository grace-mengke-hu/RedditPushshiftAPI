27 days in ... I have this specific thought recently ...

Hi everyone,

I started smoking when I was 16 - I‘m 24 now and stopped smoking about 27 days ago. 

So yes, I‘m 27 days in and never quit for so long the past 8 years.

The first few days were hard af, but it got better after day 3 to day 10.

After day 10, I barely think about smoking one.

But recently I‘m having the thought of being proud of myself, but also ...

... if I can quit for 27 days and further, I could just smoke now for quite some time and quit again.

I don‘t know if that‘s a common thing to think, when quitting, but I‘m so close of smoking one.

Send help, please ...

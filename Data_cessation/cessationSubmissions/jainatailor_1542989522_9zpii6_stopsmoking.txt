HELP ME ðŸ˜­

Hey guys, Iâ€™m 27 F and Iâ€™m seriously struggling so much. Iâ€™ve been smoke free for 6 days and Iâ€™m getting major cravings. I feel like Iâ€™m actually having the worst anxiety ever. Iâ€™m reading stuff online but nothing seems to be working?! It keeps saying distract yourself and think of other things but Iâ€™m finding it really difficult to avoid this feeling I keep getting. I donâ€™t want to continue smoking but I really feel that I need to maybe try vaping or something? Do you have any advice to give me?

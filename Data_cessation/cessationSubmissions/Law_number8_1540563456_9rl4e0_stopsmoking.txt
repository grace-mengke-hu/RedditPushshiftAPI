6 months, it's what it took me to finally click. I truly am getting better

I quit smoking around 6 months ago, even if my streak is at 32 day currently. Had a few relapse here and there, where i'd buy a pack, smoke a bunch while hitting the town then throw it away the next day.

But a week ago i was at the gym, and while doing my usual treadmill i realized i hit the 20minute mark and i was barely out of breath. It hit me like a brick, i realized i wasn't wasting my time, everyday where i felt like fucking shit and wanted to smoke so bad and i din't we're for nothing.

I don't know the point i'm trying to make, i just needed a place to share this i guess.

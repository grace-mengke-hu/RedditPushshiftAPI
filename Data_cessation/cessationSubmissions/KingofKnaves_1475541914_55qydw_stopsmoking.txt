I keep touching my face.

Three weeks on Wednesday. I've been at work steady and haven't had much cravings or anything. I've been keeping myself busy studying.

But I've hit a roadblock. I keep touching my face or arbitrarily sticking things in my mouth. Pens, keys, guitar picks, my gross fingers, etc. I tend to do this without realizing it but quickly recognize my actions and correct them. I've tried carrot smoking, chewing gum, mints, salty snacks, everything I can think of. It's starting to freak me out.

On top of that, I miss something very particular about smoking. The breathing. In, out, in, out, slow, let it burn, fester, then expel the demon fog. Idk, there was something meditative about it. It was probably the most calming rhythm I've ever encountered. I want it back, sans the "demon fog".

I'm not going back, not ever. I just miss the rhythm.

Need more tips/inspiration

A few weeks ago I tried to quit but didn't even make it a day. I bought a pack like 4 hours after I woke up. A few packs later, I found myself out of money and unable to buy a pack. Luckily I had some nicotine gum (Zonnic) that I figured would get me through the day. Apparently I didn't follow the instructions and chewed it for about 4 minutes and then my throat started to burn and I got this uncomfortable, nauseating feeling in my body. It wore off after like an hour. I used my credit and went and bought a pack, even though I was not in a bad mood or really had that bad of cravings. I was actually in a god mood and I just said "fuck it I'm going to get some. I'll quit later." 
Now here I am..about 14 cigarettes deep today (5-6 more than usual. It was a long, busy day.) and all I can think about is how I am on the fast track to cancer, heart disease, etc. I feel like crap right now. Fuck these cigarettes and fuck me for ever starting. I'm looking for some advice, inspiring words, stories, ideas, anything that might push me a little further into quitting these things for good. Or at least a decent attempt! I need help with this and I feel like I have no support. 
*sigh*

I came here after hitting "Random", I also just by chance celebrated 1 Year.

A post from /r/WritingPrompts drove me to hit the Random Subreddit button and dropped me here. I find it quite ironic that I smoked my last Marlboro just one year ago. I wouldn't have been able to do it without stubborness and an app called [Cessasion Nation](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.horner.ronald.cessationnation). The app worked great at calcualating how many cigarettes I hadn't smoked and how long since my last. I cherished the app whenever I got a craving but lost my info when I upgraded phones and didn't save it to the website. Fortunately I was already about 7 months sober at the time. This disease can be stopped but you have to want it for yourself and remember, smoke just 1 cigarette and you may as well go buy a pack because you can never have "Just 1". That's the reason for all of my failed attempts before. 

Cheers.

Edit: And GOOD LUCK!

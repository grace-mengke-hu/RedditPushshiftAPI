Yesterday was hard but I made it.

I 'quit' smoking all the time. Like at least once every 3 months for a few days or sometimes a week if I am lucky. I am hoping this time is different. I read Allen Carr and am on Champix so it's been okay. Stress has always been my 'trigger' and yesterday was pretty bad. My daughter is having surgery at the end of the month and I am returning to school in September. I could have just sat on my deck outside all the live long day and smoked a whole pack of cigarettes...but then I would be creating another problem, not solving one, right? That's what I keep telling myself at least. So yeah, one day at I time and I won yesterday so I'm proud. I think I can do it this time.

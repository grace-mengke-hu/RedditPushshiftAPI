FUCK FUCK FUCK

All I want to do right now is go buy a carton and sit and smoke them all in one big fucking chain.  Needless to say my day is not going well.

To start with my 15yo cat passed out last night and he is currently at the vets getting checked up and I am so worried about him.  He cuddles with me at night time and is my shadow as I work around home.  I honestly don't know what I will do without him.

Then, I bought 39 Mac laptops from this company and they are suppose to be delivered today, yet the only details they have given me since last week is the tracking number.  They don't seem to understand the company name would be good as well.  I am so worried that I have been scammed and this would be a big chunk out of of my company's budget if it is.  

I just want to curl up in a ball and smoke away right now.

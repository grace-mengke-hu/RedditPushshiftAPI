Did my behavior give my cat cancer?

Hey /r/StopSmoking,  I have been dealing with a lot at home, and sadly my cat, Cuervo, passed away from Lymphoma on May 10, 2016. He had a tumor in his small intestine and his condition was worse than he displayed. After surgery, his digestive system took a turn for the worse. Before he passed, I promised his life has meaning and that I wouldn't drink again. I've been reading about the type of cancer he had, and Gastrointestinal Lymphoma is the most common type of cancer found in cats. Research use to suggest that it was brought on my feline HIV, but he didn't have feline HIV. The only other research suggests it is more commonly seen in cats exposed to high levels of tobacco smoke. I smoke about 2 cigarettes ( 5-7 days/pack). I don't smoke inside, but I have... last time was probably a year ago and I was drunk. I may have done it when I was drunk... but did those few times give him lymphoma? I do believe my lifestyle effected his well-being.  I am a 28 year old female, who doesn't date and lives in a remote area. My cat has been with me for 7 years... and he definitely saw the worse of times. He was my rock and always accepting of me... I can't get the idea of out my head... that my behavior brought on his illness. Sorry for the rant, and thank you for reading.

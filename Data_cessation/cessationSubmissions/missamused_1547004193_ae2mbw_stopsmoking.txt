Got fired from my job, phone is on the fritz, and my 6 year old spilt water on my laptop..

After of course, I spent two hours re-working my resume.. YET! I am still on day 8 of being smoke free. I was sooooo close to lighting up the 172 cigs that I haven’t smoked ALL AT ONCE. But thanks to this thread.. I have not. I may have eating a half a pint of Ben and Jerry’s though... and cried alone in the dark bathroom.. my soul may be crushed. But thanks to all of you guys, and knowing I’m not alone.. I’m still nicotine free! So thank you!

I did it! SO PROUD to be able to call myself a NON SMOKER after almost 10 years of this friendship with my destructive friends, I am sorry but I had to move on...14 days clean and the best thing is: I dont even think about cigarettes anymore!

The sense of freedom and accomplishment is amazing!

From being a slave to my own addictions to becoming a non smoker without even fleeting thoughts of cigarettes is an astonishing transformation in just 14 days

I dont know about your thoughts on the subject, how long did it take for you to not have any nicotine cravings whatsoever?

I had a couple of tests to my resolve...socialized at bars with everybody around me smoking, waiting at a car appointment for 3+ hours and those are preciselly the type of situations where I know I would smoke almost a pack while dealing with boredom, anxiety etc...

In light of these changes I also made a confessions video, this is on my 7th day where I truly had some anger and appetite issues.

Dont let my post trick you, I dont have the thoughts that I want to smoke, but I did get irritable and angry like crazy  over the past 2 weeks, on days 3 and 7 it was the worst...anger management therapy incoming haha :D

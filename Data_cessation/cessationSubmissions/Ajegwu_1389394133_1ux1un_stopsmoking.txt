2 months without a cigarette!

And only one psychotic outburst!

I've been on Chantix for 11 weeks now. It is magical in the way it makes you stop wanting cigarettes. I didn't think this was possible after smoking for over 25 years. 

However, I am vomiting daily, I have ass leak and diarrhea every day, and I want to kick everyone in the teeth for no reason. 

Yesterday I spent an hour screaming at my father for no good reason. It is extremely scary to not have control of your emotions. 

I've apologized profusely, but I'm sticking this out. I will not allow a temporary attitude problem cause me to die slowly and miserable. I will be victorious.

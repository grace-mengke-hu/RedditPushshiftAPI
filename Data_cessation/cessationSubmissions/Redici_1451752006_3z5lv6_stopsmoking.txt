Need advice on quitting

OK so I've been smoking off and on (more on than off) for 6 years, I'm now wanting to quit and can resist the temptation when I'm not around other smokers but I live with 3, 2 of which constantly offer me cigarettes even tho I'm trying to quit (I know I should just say no) so does anyone have a trick to stop the craving for a cigarette around other smokers? 

P. S. I don't have the money to move out and it's my parents house so no position to make rules for others

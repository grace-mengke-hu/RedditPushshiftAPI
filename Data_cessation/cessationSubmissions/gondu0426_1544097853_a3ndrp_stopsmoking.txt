Tomorrow I start day 1 no smoking. Been smoking since the military just at 10 years now(2008) really need to stop! Asthma and Iâ€™m just tired of it to be honest.I have a small vape pen that I have used in the past. I work from home so makes it very easy to smoke whenever I choose. Any suggestions.

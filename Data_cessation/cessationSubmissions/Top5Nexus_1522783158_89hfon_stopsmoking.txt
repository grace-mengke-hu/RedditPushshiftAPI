I quit from this moment!

I smoked 7-10 cigarettes a day for 10 years.  I started when I was 18.Today I watched an episode of Ink Master. they are tattooing cancer(caused by smoking) patients. I was Scared to death by seen their scars. That's why Today I decided that I didn't want to die of lung or throat cancer. Please god give me strength!

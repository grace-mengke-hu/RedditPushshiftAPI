Relapse after nine months

I feel like an idiot. I quit smoking about nine months ago pretty much effortlessly after many, many failed attempts. I did it pretty much on a whim. I think the Allen Carr book finally got absorbed into my subconscious, and I just finished a cigarette and said that was my last one, and I stuck with it. I didn't miss it at all. For some reason I can barely fathom now, I had 'just one' a few weeks ago. Ever since then I've bought like six packs, usually smoking less than half before throwing it away and trying to quit again. It seems like I can't quit now. It was so easy the first time, and I'm just kicking myself over this, because it feels like I got trapped in a cycle where I can't quit. I *know* rationally that cigarettes do nothing for me except relieve the state of needing one, but whereas before the mind over matter got me through the withdrawals with barely a symptom, now I go eighteen hours without one and feel like I'm going crazy. 

Not sure if I'm looking for advice, stories of people who experienced similar and pulled through, or just to vent. But man, this sucks.

After 11 years of smoking I’m trying to quit again

It’s been about 3.5 days and let me tell you, I REALLY want a cigarette. I’ve quit a few times before but this time has been the worst. Constant headaches, upset stomach, and irritability. I discovered this subreddit from the smoke free app and I really hope it can keep me inspired! Thankfully I also have a good support system. A handful of my coworkers, my friends, and my significant other are super supportive. They keep telling me they’re proud of me which is so nice to hear. 

Typing this up actually helped to curb a craving. Woo!

YES. I did it guys, I did it.

I was at a party, right. After a couple shots, some beers, and a few rails, this girl offered me a cigarette.

Guess what I said??? NOPE. I was craving one sooo fucking bad. But guys, I didn't say yes. I didn't smoke a cigarette tonight. I'm almost at 60 days, which will make two months that I ended a pack and a half a day addiction.

Good luck everybody! Hope you're having a good night.

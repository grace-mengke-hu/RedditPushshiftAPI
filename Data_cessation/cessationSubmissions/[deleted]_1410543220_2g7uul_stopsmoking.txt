Not a special story, just decided to quit today. I'll look back to this post in a few months and smile.

I guess a little backstory - I'm 18 years old, have been smoking between 3-10 (usually around 4 or 5) per day since I was 15. My motivation is health, seeing as my granddad recently got diagnosed with terminal cancer and my other granddad has had heart problems for years now. The other motivation is saving money to visit my long distance girlfriend in Canada at Christmas, I freelance as a journalist but don't make much at all from it, I should have enough to go, but if i save the Â£5-10 every week from smoking in 3 and a half months I can get a damn good Christmas present.

If there are any tips that you guys have let me know, but I've probably read most of them since I've been looking around here and online for a couple of hours!

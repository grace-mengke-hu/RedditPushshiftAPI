someone told me "you havent quit smoking" after i posted a snap of me vaping 0mg juice after 9 days cig free

last year i quit but relapsed to full on smoking 2 months later

9 days ago on july 30 i quit again. and decided to help me with a new vaporizer that i use 0mg juice in it, just to have as an oral fixation. 

one friend commented on my snapchat saying that doesnt really mean you quit bro, you're still smoking but its not a cigarette/smoke. i kind of feel insulted since i truly havent smoked a cig in (almost) 10 days now and feel very proud of myself. 

if you vape, even with no nicotine, have you TRULY not quit?

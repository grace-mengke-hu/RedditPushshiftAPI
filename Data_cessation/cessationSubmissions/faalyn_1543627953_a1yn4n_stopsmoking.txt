Long road

Well I was directed to this site as a community tool to keep me smoke free.  I am now 3 day 20hrs and 45 min smoke free.   So at first I thought ‚Äúif I can just get through the 1st 24 hrs, I‚Äôll be golden‚Äù.  My last cigarette was 1130 pm Mon night.  I can‚Äôt smoke at work, so typically I don‚Äôt smoke again until my way home from work about 4 pm. But then it‚Äôs like chain smoking! So thought if I can get through the 1st night I‚Äôm good!  So I kept myself busy and made it through that first night with flying colors! 

Feeling all proud and conquering I head to work the following day.  Remember I don‚Äôt usually smoke during the day so wasn‚Äôt expecting the HORRIFIC, mind bending, panicky, overwhelming urge to smoke I had for hours that day!! Thank God I was at work because I know I would have caved and smoked!  This horrible craving last about 4-5 hrs!! Thankfully by the time I got off work it had subsided significantly and I was able to not smoke.  

So now it‚Äôs Friday night and the craving is there again, want to sit down with my glass of wine, play app games, and smoke my little heart out (literally ü§î).  But I‚Äôm hanging strong and still smoke free!!  

Reading some of the other posts here with people still struggling months after their last cigarette makes me scared I can‚Äôt hold out, but I will try and draw strength from you all and keep strong.  

Great job everyone on their courage and strength to stop this addiction and take control of your health!

Oh and the other thing I was not expecting is the horrible cough I have now developed from my lungs trying to clear themselves out!  Wow it is worse than my smokers cough ever was lol!! Anyone else?

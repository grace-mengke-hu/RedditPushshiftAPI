Struggling and potentially violent

Hello!
My first ever post - please be gentle.
I should start by saying that I’m not a particularly heavy smoker (between 8-10 per day) and since I’ve had a cold for the last week or so, I’ve smoked maybe 1 a day.

So I decided, sod it, I’ll quit. I’m usung an app called smoke free and I’m on my fourth day without a cigarette or nicotine replacements.

I’m snapping at people for saying hello. I’m constantly grinding my teeth. Oh, and for at least 20 mins per hour I want to rip a face off... but ‘I’ve not had a puff, not a single one’
Is having no friends, due to my newly acquired violent tendencies, really worth it?

Any advice is greatly appreciated.
Thank you!

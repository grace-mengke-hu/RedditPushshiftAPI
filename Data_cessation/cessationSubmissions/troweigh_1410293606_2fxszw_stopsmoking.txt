I'm smoking as I write this..

The last two days have been attempts. Yesterday I lasted twelve hours before finally having a smoke. Today, I made it fourteen. I wasn't going to have a cigarette. Then I started snapping at Co workers really badly, and my SO as well. I didn't want to keep being a dick, so I fed the craving. What do you do on day one to not snap at people and be a total pain?

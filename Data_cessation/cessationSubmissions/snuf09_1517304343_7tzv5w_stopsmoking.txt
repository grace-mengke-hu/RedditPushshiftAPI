I want to smoke. But I wont.

This is me venting for a bit. The startup I'm working for is having a tough period and seeing colleagues going for a smoke really wants to make me join them, even after having stopped for so long! 

I'm already making up excuses up in my head why starting smoking again wouldn't matter that much. But fuck I know it's bad and after having come so far one cig or even one draw can fucking end it all. 

This is why I will not do it but damn, even after a year it can be tough on certain occasions. On a normal day to day basis I don't even think about smoking... To all new guys keep fighting don't let this discourage you, this only shows how fucking bad tabacco addiction really is. And never cave in, even during bad times.

Fed up :(

I'm so over it, you guys. 

I have failed at quitting so many times, I'm at the point where I feel like I should just quit quitting.

Last time I (successfully) quit, I went almost 8 months. Ended up getting an awful job with an even worse boss who drove me back into it. Now in a new job, am happy but just can't kick the habit. I'll go 4 days at a time and then I fuck up. I know every time I shouldn't be having one, but I do. It's mostly at work as most of my work mates smoke and invite me down for break. I know I shouldn't go, but I'm so strong for days and days and then I have one.

Basically it's my own fault but I had a smoke again today and I feel so stupid and shitty I just want to cry. 

Any advice or support? Obviously the biggest word of advice is just for me to stop being so fucking stupid but I am struggling so badly I guess this is my last outlet for some sort of help... My partner doesn't understand. He quit smoking in like 2 minutes I swear, just put the pack down and never went back about four years ago. It's so hard for me. It's my thing. I actually do love to smoke, I love the social aspect of it. Sometimes I feel like I'm just quitting because I know he hates it and we don't really have the money and I feel like that's why I keep relapsing. ARGH. I don't know. This is just a fucking ramble now. 

Thinking about waking up tomorrow and going through the first day without it again makes me want to punch myself in the face. Every time I get tempted I think of the feeling of the first two days. Why can't I just stop. 


I wish I never started smoking.

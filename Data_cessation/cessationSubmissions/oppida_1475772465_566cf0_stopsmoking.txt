I've been smoke free for 1 month, 5 days, 12 hours, 42 minutes and 15 seconds!!

I feel fantastic. Seriously fantastic. It was tough the first two weeks, now I hardly think of smoking. I've been in casinos, been around smokers, even had drinks...no problemo. I'll never go back to the slavery of tobacco. 

Im super grateful for this group. Thank you. You truly helped me get through the hard parts.

For new quitters, I promise you it gets easier. Take one day at a time, one minute at a time, even one second at a time. Take deep breathes through your cravings and say "that's just a craving, it'll go away" . Over time, you'll have less and less cravings and when you have one you'll be stronger and can easily get through them.

You can do this!!!! 

Edited to add: I smoked for close to 25 years! If I can you can. I believe in all of you!!!

Which is the best method of quitting?

Hey! So I tried going cold turkey last night (it's now 10pm) 
I have smoked maybe 15 cigarettes a day for 2 years so this is very difficult for me. However I know I can do this, it's just not fun at all. I'm nasty to be around, anxious, grumpy, edgy etc. and I was wondering.
Should I stick with my cold turkey plan and not touch a cigarette for at least 3 months? Or should I have maybe one a night before sleep or something just so I can look forward to it and also to help me sleep.
Keep in mind I know I CAN continue going cold turkey.
Thanks a lot!

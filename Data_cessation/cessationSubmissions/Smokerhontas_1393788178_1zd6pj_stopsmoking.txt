Feeling good

Hi all I smoked for 8 years and quite cold turkey in 2009 when I fell pregnant it was hard but I wanted to do the best for my child, I had another child two years later still a non smoker but back last year I stupidly starting smoking again every month I said I'll give up next month and didn't. This year I told myself I had to stop I'd done it before and I should do it again for my children so 26 days ago I did just that I'm feeling good for it already. This time I will not go back

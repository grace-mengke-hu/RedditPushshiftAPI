Stopped smoking a week ago

I am sorry this is a throwaway because my friends know my real reddit id. I wanted to share my experience with you guys so here it is.
 
I am an engineering student and I had been smoking cigarettes since I was in grade 8 (I know I suck). And this has been my worst addiction till  date. I used to stay at my friends' hostels just to take a spiff. When I finished grade 10 I got more into smoking and I was out of control. I have always been successful in hiding the odour from my body in every way possible. So, I was never caught at home. I never realized smoking would cause so much trouble in my life even if I was the only person who knew I smoked. I was always short of money and I even stole money from my parents' wallets just to buy a pack of cigarettes. I am not proud of what I have done.

But last week a miracle happened. I smoked my last cigarette on November 29, 2018. I had always tried to quit smoking but the urge to smoke never escaped my soul. I tried anti-smoking gums, vape and what not. But the urge to smoke a cigarette remained. But last week I promised myself that I will never touch a cigarette in my life and I haven't till date. I just hope this run lasts a lifetime. I just felt like I should share this with you guys.

To those of you who are trying to quit smoking, I know its hard but its possible. Just believe in yourself and you will reach there.

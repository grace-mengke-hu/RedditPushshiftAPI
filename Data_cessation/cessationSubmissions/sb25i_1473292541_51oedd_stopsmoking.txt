I cheated and I'm kinda glad I did

I quit 5 days ago, which I know isn't much at all. Anyways I just gave in to a craving, and I got extremely dizzy and out of breath and I wouldn't want to relive this feeling. Can't say I'm out of the danger zone but I take it as an eye opener; I gave in and I don't feel better or relieved in any way, I just feel weak.

I just gotta start counting again now, and remember this feeling when I'm craving again.

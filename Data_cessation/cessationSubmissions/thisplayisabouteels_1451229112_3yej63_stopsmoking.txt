Got my Star!

Ok so holy shit, this is the first time in 4 or so years that I've gone more than a few days sans-cigarettes. Feeling pretty amazing tbh - my teeth actually feel clean more often than not, and I've saved around $675 (!!)

Couple of things to put down:

- This attempt felt very different from my other attempts - not straight away, but a few hours in it was just less of a psychological struggle than the other times had been. Not that the first few days weren't difficult, but there was a noticeable change.

- I imagine this'll be different for different people, but one of the best things I did was to not change the habits surrounding smoking, particularly going outside & taking a break. I never smoked indoors, so whenever I craved a cigarette I went outside, sat down, exhaled, basically did everything surrounding smoking without actually smoking. This helped me hugely. (And yeah, that means I drank pretty much the whole way through. Won't necessarily work for everyone, but it worked for me.)

- I am at the stage now where it's time to keep a closer eye on my caloric intake. My weight's always been fluctuatey, but I've definitely put on a couple of kilos since quitting. Advice though, try not to worry about it the first month at least. I was not in the headspace to do both.

- It was actually easier than I expected! Possibly related to point one, but after the first 5 days or so, the cravings I had weren't really all *that* bad, more along the lines of vaguely thinking that I *should* be smoking now, before my rational brain kicked in and told me what an idiot I was being. The last couple of weeks have actually been okay. Can't wait till I'm, what, 6 months? free and think about it even less.

You who haven't quit yet, please do! I (and everyone else here) aren't some salesmen trying to hack second-hand cars - we've got no monetary incentive to get you to quit smoking - why the hell would we lie? You *won't* miss it your whole life, things *are* awesome without it - unless you're arrogant enough to think you're the sole exception? You're not. You're *really* not. 

I'm like Julie Andrews in the fucking fjords right now.

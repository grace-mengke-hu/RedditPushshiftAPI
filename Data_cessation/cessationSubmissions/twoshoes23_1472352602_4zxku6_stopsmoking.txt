Have to change, new here

Hello r/stopsmoking, I am here to quit smoking  

I could tell my long story but id rather just highlight my weaknesses and see if anyone else has dealt with anything similar.

Frankly I only feel the urge to smoke at work or when I'm out drinking/partying with friends. I feel little urge at home or whenever I am around my family. I absolutely never smoke in front of my kids, which I have fostered as a prime force in quitting smoking ( especially since I have another one on the way).  

My main issue is work, because going out drinking is simple to curb by not going out. Ive considered having a vape pen just for going out to the bar because sometimes after a rough week friday night i like to go out and have a couple.   

As cheesy as it sounds, a friend once told me that the thing that drags me back to smoking each time ( ive quit before, after my 1st and 2nd children were born) is the nihilistic release during a bad/stressful day. This, in my mentally ludicrous rational, applies upon getting to work and towards the end of the shift.  I know what a load of crap that is, but when I'm in a bad way mentally, the first thing that helps me cool down and rationalize it is getting a cig. This leads me into my next point.  

I historically have bummed so many cigarettes that I almost always relapse by bumming one of somebody on a bad day at work/ on the street. Often times Ill go out to the bar and just drink and hunt cig's all night, which I really don't like about myself honestly.   

Last night in particular I smoked ALOT, and I am feeling it today. I have such a history with cig's, and i suppose a sense of identity with them, that quitting them I can do in a strong mindset, but not relapsing on the bad days is the real struggle for me. I have a couple of 14mg patches of which I'm going to use Monday-Wednesday and go from there. Confident I can get through tomorrow no problem.  

I think that covers it...  

Help?

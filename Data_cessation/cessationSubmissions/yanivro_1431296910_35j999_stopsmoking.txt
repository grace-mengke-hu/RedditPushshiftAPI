Survived a big ass 3 days student festival without smoking :D

So , we have such student festival called Di√°knapok and it's basically 3 days of just drinking and party and I refused so many cigarettes that was offered.

 but the best feeling was when a cigarette promoter came to me for a few question I was more then happy to say with a big smile " I don't Smoke "

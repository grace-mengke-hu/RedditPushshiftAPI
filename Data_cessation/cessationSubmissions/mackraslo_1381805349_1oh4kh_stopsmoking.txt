To everyone fighting the good fight, Keep up the great work and know you are among friends!

I just wanted to give out some small support vibes to all the quitters out there!  You are doing such an amazing thing by quitting smoking!  Believe in yourself and your goals, never stop trying and pulling yourself back up!  Small victories lead to giant accomplishments!  Thank you /r/Stopsmoking for being so awesome!

"Too stupid or too weak?"

8 or 9 years ago this is what a passerby bicyclist screamed at me while I was smoking outside my apartment building.  

I really took offense to it at the time.. how dare he?!  I remember literally wanting to chase him down and demand an explanation.  Maybe engage him in combat for daring to challenge my honor.

I don't know man, that really stuck with me.  It's not what ultimately prompted me to quit or anything, but I definitely thought about it intermittently all these years.  

Maybe this is a "thing" for quitters to do that I'm unaware of.  I'm thinking about yelling this at some smokers.

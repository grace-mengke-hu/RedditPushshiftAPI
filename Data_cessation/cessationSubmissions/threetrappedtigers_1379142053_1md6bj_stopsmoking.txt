I fell off the wagon

Hi guys, I was going 10 days strong! I had left the patches and was feeling amazing. I got very drunk last night and smoked. The guilt i feel is overwhelming I feel so disappointed in myself and so scared that I fell off the wagon. Has anyone got any wise words? Whats a good way to stop the cravings whilst drinking?

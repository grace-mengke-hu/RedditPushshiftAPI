Need help! Question about possible social app that goes along with Nicotine gum

I'm working on a project for school, and we're thinking of pitching an idea to help the effectiveness of some cessation products (gum in particular).

It seems like this sub-reddit is such a good forum for so many people, so I'm hoping you might be able to give some good insights... What do you guys think about an app that allows you to see and communicate with other people in your area (anonymously) specifically about quitting smoking?   Would you use something like this?  What kind of functions would you want to see?  It would most likely be branded, and probably reward users for participation with coupons, points, etc.  

We're thinking this might be a great tool for people to a) get feedback and encouragement, b) give tips, and c) feel like they're apart of a community (much like you do here).  We'd really appreciate any thoughts you might have, thanks so much!

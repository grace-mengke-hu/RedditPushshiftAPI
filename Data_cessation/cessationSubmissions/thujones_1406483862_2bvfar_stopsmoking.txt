What is your "reason" for quitting smoking?

I have always been of the opinion that ANY reason to quit is a GOOD reason to quit.

We all know its bad for us and we should have quit a long time ago and all that jazz.  What is your main "reason" for quitting?

Mine is my love for scuba diving.  #1 reason most people quit is because of sinus issues.  Since I have quit smoking, I have enjoyed much easier "clearing" (equalization in the sinuses) and a better overall SAC rate (air consumption).  Not to mention it is getting easier to schlep all that gear around and I am much less winded!

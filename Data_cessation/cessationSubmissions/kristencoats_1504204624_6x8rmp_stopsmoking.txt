The ultimate test

Today was the first day I was actually sitting on the porch with someone smoking and I did not just resist, I actually wasn't tempted at all! It literally gave me the feeling that I can accomplish anything I put my mind too! For all those new quitters, stick with it! It only gets easier, don't let yourself be miserable because it's just a waste of time.

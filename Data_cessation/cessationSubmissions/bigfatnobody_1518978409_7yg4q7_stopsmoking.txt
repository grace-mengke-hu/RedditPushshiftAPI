Surprising effect of quitting cigs: No Hangovers.

I went out drinking the last two nights and drank enough that I normally wouldn't be able to get out of bed the following day. Since I've switched to vaping it appears I don't get hangovers anymore.  Makes me wish I had quit sooner.  Anybody else have the same experience?

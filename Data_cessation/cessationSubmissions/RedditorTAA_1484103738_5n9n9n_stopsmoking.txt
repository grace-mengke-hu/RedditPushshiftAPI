Addicted to vaping nicotine

Hey guys, I'm new to this sub. I'm currently a vaper, been vaping for four years and my reason for vaping started not because of cigarettes but because of pot. 

I used to have really bad anxiety and pot helped but I reached a point in my life where I was high nearly 24/7 and I decided to quit because it was starting to control my life. Quitting pot was not that hard because I replaced it with another addiction: vaping. 

I no longer have to deal with anxiety and I want to quit all together but now that I'm physically addicted to the nicotine, I find it extremely difficult. I'm a god damn idiot and I wish I could have quit pot in a healthier way rather than replacing it with another habit. 

I currently vape 24mg nicotine (started at 6mg, increased for better throat hit) and I'll have to go cold turkey one day because lowering the nic dosage just doesn't cut it for me; I don't get the throat hit. It's all or nothing for me. The longest I've gone without it was a record of a few hours. Can anyone relate? To former vapers who quit both cigs and vape, what helped you?

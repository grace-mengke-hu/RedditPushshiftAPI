Quitting August 1st, again

So, I'm going to give it another shot August 1st.

I've got my last few packs. I've got my mints. I've got my "smoke free" app. I've got an appointment to get the car detailed to get the smoke smell out of it.  I've got my year goal set (I smoke enough, a year smoke free will pay for my sleeve tattoo that I've wanted forever). 

Now, I just need to make it happen. 

I've quit for around a year twice before, but something has always happened to throw me back into the arms of smoking. Both times I've quit for other reasons besides myself, I'm hoping this time since I'm doing it for me, it'll stick better.

Through sheer force of will, I will do it this time.

Day 9 - Intense Fatigue!

Okay, so I'm in the midst of day 9 since quitting. Although I've attempted to quit many times before, this time really hasn't been too difficult... Until today. It's not even that I'm craving a smoke, I am just unbelievably fatigued today. I'm at work at the moment and can barely focus and when I talk I kinda just ramble to my employees about nothing. Has anybody else encountered fatigue or other symptoms this many days into quitting without feeling them before?

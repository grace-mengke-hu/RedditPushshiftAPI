Things that have helped so far (day 19).

What has worked;

1. Nicotine mints (gives me a quick and easy response to extreme cravings)

2. Altoids mints in excel tin (I suspect my brain sometimes thinks they are nicotine mints. Stoopid brain.)

3. Video Games (it helps to step out of reality for a little bit, I tend to be a little calmer and better composed after a little bit of xbox)

4. Lego (for whatever reason my brain does not enter craving mode when I am building a Lego set)

5. Magic the Gathering (I have a lot of fond memories of playing when I was a teenager, it predates a lot of bad habits, the part of me that likes Magic cards is the same part that thinks smoking is stupid)

6. Being an Ass (sometimes I just have to say something terrible to someone, I try to be as extreme and ridiculous as possible so nobody accidentally takes me seriously)

7. Kiss my partner (reminds me of how much better I smell and taste now)

8. Take a minute to focus on my experience of breathing (ask Buddy Wakefield)

9. Read some comics (thank you Neil Gaiman)

This list is a part of my day 19 activities on the Smoke Free App. Good luck everyone! Thanks for letting me share.

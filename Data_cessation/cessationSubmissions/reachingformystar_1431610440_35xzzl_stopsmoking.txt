Starting the quit again after this epiphany

I just finished my last cigarette and I am done.

Yesterday I played soccer with my kids and my lungs hurt for hours after. Now that the school summer break is coming up, I want to be able to play with them every day.

I remembered my last quit (8 days) and realized that the withdrawals and cravings were much milder compared to how much my lungs hurt this time. I will have to go through this everytime I get on the playground. It is easier to just quit for good and go through a one time hell week now and get it done and over with for the summer.

I have been attempting to quit for most of the last year and the benefits always seemed so long term that it was easy to relapse. This seems like a good short term goal that will take me over the hump to the point where the habits would be replaced with newer healthier ones and it should be easier to stay quit.

I am making this post here to firm up my commitment and dip into support this incredible community provides.

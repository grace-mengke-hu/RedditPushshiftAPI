Making the final steps

So i've a been a smoker for a few years, started social and eventually started to smoke 10-20 a day. I've set myself a goal to run a half marathon at the end of september and i've cut down significantly to 1-2 a day but i can't hold on til the end of the day to not have one. Any tips on how to push aside the cravings?

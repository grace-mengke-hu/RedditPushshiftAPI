Physically the worst withdrawal symptoms I've ever had

It's now Friday, the last time I had a cigarette was Tuesday while watching the England vs Colombia RO16 game. 

I started going back gym properly Wednesday and since then my desire to smoke has been lessened from this, the cravings are still very much there however, and I'm still a ways off my record of a week no smoking.

Yesterday on day 2 my throat and nose started becoming very runny, I've started sneezing a lot and it's become very unpleasant, perhaps flu like, though I am still able to physically move around and do my day to day things, my body is starting to feel a bit fatigued now however, this at the moment is fucking shit, I have no idea if it's related to my current attempt at quitting or if it's just bad timing.

I just woke up and it's even worse, I hope this passes, I'm fed up of this fucking nicotine, I'm currently broke because I spent half my money on payday two weeks ago on a packet upon packet upon packet and now I'm the broke fool once again.

Yesterday I was also in quite the mood, which one of my friends constantly tried in their way to help by offering my cigarettes, which I had to constantly decline, I'm proud of that little victory.

I'm fed up of being broke, I'm fed up of constantly thinking about this shit, 1 year and 1 month smoking and I'm ashamed I've let it get this far. Ugh.

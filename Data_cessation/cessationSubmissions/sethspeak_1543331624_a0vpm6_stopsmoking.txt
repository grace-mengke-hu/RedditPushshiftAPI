100 days!

First time poster, long time reader. Smoked for 10 years, about half a pack a day. My partner quit around 2 years ago, which started me feeling like I needed to get my act together. I was sick of walking in to work wondering if I smelled. I was sick of always waiting for another opportunity to go out and smoke. I felt embarrassed when I smoked in front of friends and family. I hated the thought of smoking away my hard earned money. 

That being said, I did enjoy smoking, and struggled to find a time when I really felt like I wanted to quit. I tried every "rule" I could think of. No smoking until after work. No buying my own packs. No more than three a day. Nothing worked, I was always back at it sooner or later. I spent months in that place, basically bargaining with myself to avoid admitting that I didn't have control over my habit.

I quit as a birthday present to myself. I hit an age where I'm feeling older and think I should learn to take care of myself. I'm using 4mg lozenges and plan to cut down to 2mg, then hopefully nothing. I'm watching my cravings carefully and using all the cognitive and behavioral skills I can. For me, reminding myself of how bad I would feel if I sent myself back to day one is a powerful motivator. Relying on my partner when things get tough is also helpful, and I feel proud when he anticipates me having a craving and I'm actually under control. I pay close attention to the smell of smokers and remind myself that I don't want that. I use deep breathing and redirect myself if I feel a strong craving. I can definitely say that 100 days out, it's becoming much easier to manage. And the time adds up so quickly!

I just wanted to say thanks to all of you, you made a difference for me. And to those lurkers like myself, keep reading and believe that your time to quit is near! Thanks everyone! Looking forward to my smoke free future.

a hate a day

I've been bummed out since I quit smoking...trying to make use of all the free time that I've created just by deciding not to smoke is astonishing but, wow! one can get bored very easily. so, I've taken it upon myself to write at least 1 thing I hate about smoking everyday while I'm in a crave period. sooooo... here is the 1st of many more to come.

1. I hate the way smoking makes me feel....now that I'm a non-smoker, my energy levels have never been higher. I've been a smoker for +15 years and now that I've started doing personal trainer work professionally, being in the gym is 1000x more enjoyable because I'm able to complete HITT training without feeling completely wiped out half way thru a set. Thank you Me for deciding to stop smoking.

From cigarettes to juul to nothing

I quit smoking with the help of Juul back in February. Started out with both and gradually switched to just the Juul. 
I’ve never had an issue with yellow teeth, but my SO pointed out that my teeth look yellow lately. They were never yellow even with cigarettes so it has to be the Juul! 

I also spend $45-60 a week on Juul so it’s getting crazy. I’m looking to stop using the Juul because I simply cannot afford it. I’ve been pinching pennies as it is. However, I feel like I NEED it. I almost wanna switch back to cigarettes because I can afford those and I want my nicotine &amp; habit fix. I am on my last pod so after this is out I’m putting on a nicotine patch! Wish me luck

Starting today I’m choosing not to smoke.

I’m breaking my morning routine by taking the morning off. I’ve lasted 4-5 days multiple times, I hit that point then go back. Never satisfied with the decision but happens. I’ve hit the point of choosing to stop, I tried a few days ago but failed come Monday morning. I have a running background and have lost that. I want to start the new year in a good place. Any great tips or suggestions. I need help with this to get past the week mark.

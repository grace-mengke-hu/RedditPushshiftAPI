RESET my badge :(

After nearly two years I fell back in to it. I'm not nearly as hooked as I was when I quit 6 years ago for 2 years or again when I quit for another 2 years. (Seems like I have a problem 2 years in... hmmm) 

Been smoking between 1-10 a day for the past few weeks. I'm clearly not a non-smoker anymore. 
I'm disappointed in myself but I know now that I'm capable of freeing myself from the addiction for 2 years, now I just need to string those two years together for about the next 60 years or so. 

Anyway don't give in, whether it be 1 day or 10 years don't let a relapse become a lifelong habit. Everyone makes mistakes but you decide how to handle those mistakes.

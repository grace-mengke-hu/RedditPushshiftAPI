Today is my last day!

It was 12pm and I have had my last cigg. Have been smoking since I was 17, 23 now. And today at 12 was my last cigg for hopefully a long time I have tried to quit several times in the past and failed miserably. And starting to have lung problems and not being able to do as much as I use to, use to be on the track team and baseball team in high school. I need to quit this horrible for good.

Edit: habit sorry forgot a word.

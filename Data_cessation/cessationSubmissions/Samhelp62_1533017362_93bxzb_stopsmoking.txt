Just Finished Reading Allen Carr's Book and Final Cigarette. I'm Feeling Excited! :)

I've been smoking for 10 years from age 15 to 25. Before reading Allen Carr's book, I had always struggled with quitting because I thought nicotine was either pleasurable and helping me stay motivated. Today, it was hard to enjoy any cigarette when I was half way through the book. I never felt so excited to quit. With all that said, I hope to not give anyone the impression that I am conviced that every moment during the acute withdrawal phase is not going to have any pain or cravings. Those first few weeks are obviously going to hurt. However, I don't see the contradiction in being opitimistic before my mood takes a turn when the serious withdrawals kick in.There's nothing wrong with be positive and realistic at the same time. Hope you guys do well with your journy --I'll be sure to post updates on this subreddit. Good luck!

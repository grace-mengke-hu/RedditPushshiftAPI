Upset, in pain, and all I want is a cig

I stopped smoking a little over 4 months ago, the last one being the morning before I had to get brain surgery.


Now I've dealt with my fair share of stress these past 4 months with recovery, medical bills, insurance company, disability...etc. And I've been fine, found ways to handle it other than smoking. 


Now due to the illness I had, it caused my right knee to hurt for the past 6 months. I've tried everything to get it to stop to no avail. Just had all these tests done and the knee doctor today told me that there is nothing wrong and that I'll just have to "deal with it".


Ensue huge meltdown right when I got home. I've been crying for hours now and all I can think about is going down the street to the store and picking up my old favorite cigs. Well instead of doing that I'm forcing myself to write this. Looking at my quit now app, I've been cigarette free for 132 days. Like I've said, I've been through a ton of stressful moments, but for some reason this is hitting me harder than anything else. I know smoking won't take the pain away or make things right but God damn do I just want that cigarette in my hand to take me to that happy place for 7 minutes.

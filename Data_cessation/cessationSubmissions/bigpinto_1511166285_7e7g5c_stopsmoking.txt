can't believe its been a month since I quit.

Wow, one month already since I quit. Time flies. I quit after smoking for 25 years and this has been my longest quit in last 23 years of smoking like a chimney. Looking good so far. Hopefully I will continue being an ex-smoker.

By the way, when does an ex-smoker become a non-smoker? one year?

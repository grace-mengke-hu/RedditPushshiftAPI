Just Found this sub, thanks for the inspiration.

I've been reading this sub for the last hour to keep myself from having a cig.  I feel a little silly posting since I had half a cigarette this morning planning to have the other half tonight. I've been smoking about a pack in a 24 hour period since I was 16 and now 16 years later I feel like I would really like to stop. I've made half assed attempts in the past, hoping that the wellbutrin would do all the work for me, but since my heart was not in it I have not been successful. The last time I talked to my doctor he told me that I'm on the precipice, that if I quit now in 10 years if someone looked at my lungs they would have a hard time telling I was a smoker. I've been trying to rationalize having a cig all day I've been back on my wellbutrin for less that a week and I know that I will become more effective next week so the addict in my head is saying it's Ok to keep smoking for  another week until the meds really kick in. I've been chewing nicotine gum all day so I know that its not the actual nicotine that I'm craving, and that if I go have a cigarette it's going to taste terrible, but part of me is still willing to go out and smoke through the disgust. I've never tried a quit line or anything like that but I thought maybe I would post here. It has been inspiring to read other peoples post, and comforting to know that other people are having the same cravings, and emotional turmoil as I am. Again I feel a bit foolish posting since I'm not even a full day into this, but sitting here typing has stopped me from going out to smoke, and has re-enforced my desire to finally do this. I read in a post that someone would say to themselves in a Gandolf voice "this too shall pass". I absolutely loved that, I'm a comic book reader so I have borrowed Legions mantra of "I rule me" and have been repeating it to myself over and over again through out the day, and would like for it to be true one day soon.

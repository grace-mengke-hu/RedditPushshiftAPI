Mornings Make Me Cave

Hi All,  


I've been a bit of a lurker while also trying to quit. Around a week ago I went over a day without smoking, but had that one and am back to where I was. Any tips on how to get up in the morning and not cave? It seems I will go to bed determined to quit and when I awake, it's like my mind goes into a frenzy and I end up getting a pack.

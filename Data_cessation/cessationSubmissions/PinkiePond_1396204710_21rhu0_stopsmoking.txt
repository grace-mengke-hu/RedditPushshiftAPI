One week in, and sruggling with motivation

I only stopped smoking a week ago because I could no longer afford to: I'm approaching the end of my student loan money so it's food or cigarettes for now. I've been okay for the last week with that thought, but how do I carry on not smoking when I am able to afford to again? I don't want to start smoking again, but when my only motivation is financial and I am due another loan installment in a month, I need something better to keep me going :/

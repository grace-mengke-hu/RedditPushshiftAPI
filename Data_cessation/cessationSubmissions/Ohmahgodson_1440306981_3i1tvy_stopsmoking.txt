Im drunk! And I'm not smoking

May my post in no way be interpreted as drinking is a good thing, however my last quit attempt (for nearly a year) failed when I got shit hammered.

This time I am drinking as I normally would. Yes, my cravings are stronger, but I feel good building new habits as I drinking without smoking.

I wanted to smoke today but I chose not to. Cheers to everyone that has quit smoking! You arent losing anything. In fact, you are gaining freedom and much more!

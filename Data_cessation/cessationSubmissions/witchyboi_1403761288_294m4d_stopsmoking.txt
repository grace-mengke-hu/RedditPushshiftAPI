Day 5 on the e-cig (hey, don't judge me!)

After 1.5 years smoke free, I went through divorce court at 10:00 in the morning and was in the bar with a pack of smokes by 11. That was last August, and that pack of cigarettes cost me almost $3,000 so far.

After a couple of abortive attempts with e-cigs, I finally found a good juice, and I'm at day 5 with no withdrawal to speak of. I have been smoking for almost 30 years, and have tried everything except Chantix. Honestly, at this point I'm fine if I remain a slave to nicotine if it means I don't have to spend $8 a day on cigs.

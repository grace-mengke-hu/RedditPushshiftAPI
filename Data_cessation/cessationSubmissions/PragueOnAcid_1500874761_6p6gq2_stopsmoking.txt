How can I make my last cigarette my last?

I used to be a heavy smoker, now I go up to ten days here or there without one but then will get a pack and kinda binge. It's like I feel a quit date needs to be a momentous day or something so I can look back and remember. But I don't want to keep putting it off. How can establish a sense of permanency in my mind with today just being another random day?

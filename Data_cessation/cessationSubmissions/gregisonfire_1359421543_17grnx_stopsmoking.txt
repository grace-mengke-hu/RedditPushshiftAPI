TV/Movies

It's been about a week now since I've quit. My cravings are a lot less than I anticipated but have crept up in unexpected places. I have the morning caving, which was expected, but I'm starting to get cravings by watching movies/TV shows where people smoke. This doesn't happen when I see real smokers. Has this happened to anyone else?

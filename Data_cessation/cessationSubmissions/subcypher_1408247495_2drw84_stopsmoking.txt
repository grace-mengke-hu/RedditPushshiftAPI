I Just Hit A Very Personal Milestone In My Journey And I Wanted To Thank You All

You may or may not have seen me post before. Three years ago I started my journey lurking in /r/loseit with learning about eating right and losing weight. About the same time I began learning about exercising and found an exercise program that worked for me. I [only posted once](http://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/10uxik/can_i_join_the_party_weight_is_not_my_goal_but/), but it’s what got me started. Two years ago I ventured in to /r/stopsmoking, admittedly lurking, but [I eventually spoke up](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1r7wed/cigarette_free_for_over_a_year_now/). Roughly a year ago I made my way into /r/ stopdrinking and decided to [join that club as well](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1r5df6/been_a_long_time_coming/).

My journey has been long, as all our journeys are. It’s had its ups and downs, as all our journeys do. My tactics, tools, plans of attack, directions, and everything else have changed over time as well. But today was a milestone I’ve been looking forward to for some time. I just completed my first mud/obstacle run today: the [Warrior Dash 2014 in Earlham, IA.](http://i.imgur.com/SSu9uwg.jpg) I ran nearly the whole thing, completed every obstacle, and finished in a time that I was quite proud of. I credit a big part of that to the advice and support of you three subs. You have helped change my life for the better. I just wanted to say thanks.

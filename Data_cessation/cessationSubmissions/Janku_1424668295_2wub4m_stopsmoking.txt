So I had an idea for a anti-smoking commercial. Here's the concept. Now… someone get a grant and produce this...

Anti-Smoking Ad

Typical suburban home USA.
Family of four.

Mom and daughter go to bed and bid good night.

Toddler son is still awake with dad.

They watch a bit of a rated G movie together on the couch.

Dad says, “I’m going outside for a moment, I’ll be right back.”

Toddler says, (super cutely) “Okay”.

Dad goes outside and smokes.

He peers through the window and watches his son inside waiting for him.

Perhaps repeat this exchange once or twice as both father and son age.

Then, show the father attempt to get inside but the door is locked or he is somehow otherwise prevented from entering.

Somehow reveal that he is dead in a coffin yet conscious.

Then show a montage of the son growing older through various life milestones like graduation, marriage, fatherhood etc. with the father peering through the window from outside (a la super spooky horror film) watching all this happen and wanting to participate and be heard… but unable to be seen or heard.

Perhaps at one or two the milestones, the son views a photo of dad sadly.

* This could be re-arranged gender wise

day 3 - check in

Things are a little better today. Cravings were a bit strong last night but when I woke up this morning they weren't as bad. Treated myself to a nice lunch with part of the $24 I've saved since Monday. I'm still taking it one hour at a time but it's definitely a LOT easier today. Thanks for being here. Cheers.

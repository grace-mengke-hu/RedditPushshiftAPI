Tips on vacation

Not really a vacation, but going up to a lake-house for the weekend. Anybody have any tips they'd like to share? There will be lots of drinking. 

It helps that everyone thats going up there is a non-smoker. However, those drunk cravings scare the shit out of me. No way I can get out of this, as I confirmed/payed months before.

Got My Laptop Stolen and Car Window Busted

Car Window Busted: $175

Laptop Stolen: $1150 + rip everything since i last backed up my comp

Zero Cigarettes Smoked or Craved during the entire debacle: **absolutely fucking priceless**.

Thanks so much guys. I'm on my way to total victory I can feel it. Two weeks down, a lifetime of nicotine-free goodness to go!

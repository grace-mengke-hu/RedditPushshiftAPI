Thoughts on Nicoderm CQ (or similar)?

Ignore the flair. I just put in to reset it; it's been a long time since I've visited here. 

I'm ready to quit. I want to quit. I *need* to quit.

Has anyone had any success with Nicoderm CQ or alternatives? I smoke ~10 a day, though sometimes more and sometimes less. Which "step" should I start with?

Aside from Alan Carr's book, does anybody have any suggestions for substitutions? I will ultimately be cutting nicotine out entirely, but I would like something to help me out in the meantime.

Quit Smoking today.

I have been smoking for 5 years. They were one of the worst menthol cigarettes, too. I still have an unopened pack in my purse and I'm not quite sure how to get rid of it, any creative ideas? I am pretty sure I wont go back, its like a switch has flipped in my head. I hope subscribing to this subreddit helps :D

Starting day four, again!

I quit on set 9, and failed after one month, it was a full relapse, I smoked for a whole weeks after that, chain smoking as before, I re-read Allen Carr, and yes, he makes sense in the whole smoking is an addiction, you don't enjoy it, it's all an ilussion. Yes! I'm on board. 

I'm starting day four and OMG I feel like shit, I miss smoking, I know it's just the addiction, but damn it! It's not easy how Allen said it would be.

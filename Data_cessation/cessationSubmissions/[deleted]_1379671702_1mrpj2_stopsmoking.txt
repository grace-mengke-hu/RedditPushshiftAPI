Day 3 thoughts - Unexpected positives!

I save about 10 minutes in the mornings now, which means if I wake up late I am able to be ready for work much more calmly without stress.  As a morning smoke was *always* top priority.

Less clutter in my pockets, now I only need to think about picking up my keys, phone and wallet!  No making sure I have filters, lighter, papers and tobacco!


At the end of the day when I leave, if I don't notice the time and leave late then I do not have worry about making sure I have all my smoking things and having time to roll one.


My mouth feels a bit strange and my tongue is getting smoother.  For some reason my voice seems to be deepening.  My sense of smell is improving and I am noticing that cologne smells generally nicer and much more rich.

These are all positives I hadn't even thought of but are having a fairly positive impact on my life.

All in all, I am so far finding it a lot easier than I imagined I would.  Only one "rage phase" so far, which passed.


Do any of you have any pleasant stories to share?

Wish me luck frens

Gonna try cold turkey from today. Cigarettes are very cheap (about 2 dollars a pack) where I live so I think its gonna be a hard one. Been smoking since i was 15 as a coping method for stress (stupid ik) but i could feel how much its fucking up my life from 2-3 a day to a pack daily. I'm 18 now gotta stop quick.
Apologies for my bad english its not my first language &gt;.&lt;

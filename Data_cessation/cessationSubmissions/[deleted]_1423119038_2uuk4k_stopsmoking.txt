Quitting light smoking

I smoked for a few years at different levels never more than 4 or 5 cigs a day (which felt like a lot to me but I understand comparatively isn't that much). I've heard it can be harder for light smokers to quit than heavier ones. As a light smoker trying to quit I think this might be true. I've tried a few times recently and kept giving in to the "just one" fallacy. I'm about a week into this quit and feeling more confident than previously. But it's problematic for a few reasons. 

Firstly almost every cigarette was a good one. I know people who smoke heavy amounts say a lot of them aren't even pleasant. Limiting yourself made each one sweeter since you'll be at a higher withdrawal level each time. 

Also there's an unavoidable pattern of rationalizing that light smoking actually isn't that bad, especially not compared to what some people do, and especially if you haven't been at it long. This makes it hard to keep your motivation up. 

Anyone have any advice dealing with these specific kinds of difficulties? I'm doing the cold turkey alan carr thang btw

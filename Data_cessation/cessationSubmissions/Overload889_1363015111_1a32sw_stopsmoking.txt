And it begins... Day 1

I have been wanting to quit for a long time now, and after multiple failed attempts to cut back to zero, I finally just stopped buying more.

My last one was around 11 am yesterday. I am having a bit of edginess right now, but Im in jury duty and cant go outside regardless, so it kinda helps.

As cliche as it sounds, my final motivation was Yoda. I remember thinking "*I'm really going to try to quit this time"*. The "do or do not" quote popped into my head and it was exactly what I needed. 

Not sure what to expect as the day/days go on. Hopefully the symptoms will be mild.

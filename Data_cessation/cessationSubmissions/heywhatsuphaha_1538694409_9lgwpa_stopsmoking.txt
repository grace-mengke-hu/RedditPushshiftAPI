Anxiety

Stopped my vape 3 or 4 days ago I think. 
Heart feels weird, anxiety on my chest.
Wish I never started smoking. Or any other bad habits. Can’t say it was my fault when I grew up around it and family didn’t care to hide it or anything when I was younger. Don’t even remember my mom or dad or anyone telling me to stop smoking as a teenager.
This world is a cruel place.

Do you use any Quit Smoking App? If yes, which one?

I'm looking through some android apps that help with the achievement idea that can be a good fuel to keep going.

Right now I'm using a simple app that tracks days, shows healthy advices and features a distraction game.

So I went here looking for some app thread, and surprisingly, didn't found anything, so I'm going to ask and hopefully, we'll get some good app list to keep us motivated!

Do you use any Quit Smoking App? If yes, which one, and why do you like it?

Thanks guys!

Wellbutrin

I'm getting a prescription for Wellbutrin XL to help with MDD. My psychiatrist let me know that it is also often used as a smoking cessation medication.

Has anyone here had any experience with Wellbutrin? I'm still currently a smoker [Well, I vape, but I'm a nicotine fiend and I only replaced my smoking habit with it] and was wondering if it helped anyone here in the cold turkey method.

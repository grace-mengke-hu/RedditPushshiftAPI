5 days past the goal! I've a few words to say.

Missed out on the one year mark, by a couple days, but i did it!

Y'all know what that means!?!   SO CAN YOU!!!  

Remember to keep at it, don't give in to the cravings. At the time having "one" may seem like an ok idea but stopping is one of the best decisions you can make for yourself. Your making yourself healthier (obviously) but your also becoming stronger, by exercising your will power. 

Remember folks, keep at it. You've taken the first steps towards a better life, and once you reach whatever end your going for; you can look back and laugh at how hard it may have seemed in the moment, laugh at how much money you used on  something so disgusting, laugh at how you may have thought it impossible, all while your sitting outside on a beautiful spring day able to smell the fragrant flowers, KNOWING you made the right decision.
                                                -Keep at it

I have a little technique.

We have to rethink going outside. I'm on the older side, and for much of my young adulthood, everyone smoked inside. Now that I've quit, outside is where it's at for me. You all need to figure out how outside=no smoking. It's sublime. All I want to do is run around outside and breathe.

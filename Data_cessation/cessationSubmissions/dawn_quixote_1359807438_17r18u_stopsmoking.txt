20 hours smoke free and tingly fingers

I am about to cry because this is the longest i have ever been smoke free unassisted in over 10 years.  It's only been 20 hours, but this has just been a very emotional morning for me.  

Anyways, my right fingertips are tingly.  Not in a painful way, and I can still feel with them.  I'm just wondering if this is normal.

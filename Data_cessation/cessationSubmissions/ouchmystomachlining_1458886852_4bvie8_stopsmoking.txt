1 month smoke free, feeling off. :(

Hi everyone, first off I want to say thank you all for sharing your quitting stories, honestly without them I wouldn't be as far along in my own quit as I am. I am writing this because I am about one month nicotine free, smoked a pack a day for a good 8 or so years, then chewed a can a day for about a year and then smoked and chewed for the last year before i quit. This is the longest I have gone on a quit attempt and am doing everything in my willpower to keep it that way. I haven't been feeling myself, for example I feel like a zombie on autopilot mode just going throughout my day going through the motions, kind of as if I am in a constant daydream. I have also noticed a peak in anxiety and panic attacks. I was just wondering if this is anything anyone else went through as well. It really sucks and would make me feel better knowing I'm not the only one that is feeling or has felt this way. Also, if anyone has any suggestions or advice on how they got over this feeling it'd be much appreciated.

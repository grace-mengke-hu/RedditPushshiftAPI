The feeling after beating a craving = awesome

Earlier today, I was pissed off at myself for not getting enough work done, my roommate for being stubborn, my apartment owners for raising rent, and on and on. On top of that, I was tired and stressed out. Too many demands, too little time...

I wanted a smoke badly, and it got to the point that I started walking toward the corner store to get one. On the way there, I had to walk through a wooded area, and I felt a bit more relaxed. Then I left the woods and saw the sunset over the city. The air was nice, and I soon felt much better than a cig could make me feel. Then I thought about how I would feel 5 minutes after finishing the cig...smelly, head spinning, full of regret for trashing all that time. As I've learned here, smoking doesn't solve problems--it just adds another one.

Turned around and hit the gym. Set a new record on the stair climber and got some core work in too.

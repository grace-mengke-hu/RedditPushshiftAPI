Experiences of getting into exercise after quitting?

I've been quit about a week now, and I was hoping to get back into exercise. There's an adult gymnastics class nearby which sounds fun, and there's a swimming pool.

I'm worried about how I'll look though, I have an office job and I've smoked heavily for the past decade. I can barely climb stairs without getting out of breath and I'm in my mid-20s. So doing actual exercise in front of other people seems really nerve-wracking.

Has anyone had any experiences of exercising in front of others after quitting? What was it like? Did it get easier?

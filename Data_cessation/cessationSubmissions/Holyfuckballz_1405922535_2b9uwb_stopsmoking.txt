I just really wanted to share this somewhere.

My family doesn't know I even smoke, my main motivation for quitting is so that they'd never find out, actually, so I can't share this with them, but I'm proud and want to share with someone. I figured you guys might appreciate. Sorry if it's ramble-y. I don't reddit much. 

I started smoking a little over a year ago. Mostly just me being a "super rebellious teen", but it got out of hand so much faster than I expected, because its like I buy them without even really thinking, you know? I have terrible willpower.

Anyways, the good part, today I walked two miles to a gas station down the road because I thought I needed cigarettes. I had a bad day at work and college and I hated everything. When I left the house I was certain that buying a new pack would help. It took me about half an hour, maybe, and I spent the whole time thinking. Not even about smoking, really, just thinking. I honestly don't know how I talked myself out of it, but when I got to the station, I stood outside for about two minutes, then turned around and walked home. 

This marks the fourth day without smoking.

I'm just really proud of myself. :)

Thanks for reading.

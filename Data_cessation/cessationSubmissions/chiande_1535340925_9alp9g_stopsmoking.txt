Waking up too early

Hi,

I smoked my last cigarette on the first of August. Since then I've been avoiding cigarettes but I've been smoking weed mixed with tobacco, so I had my nicotine income.
Two weeks ago I decided to quit nicotine cold turkey. I made it, and I've never felt so good about myself just because instead of smoking I've been running A LOT.
There's just one thing I don't understand: since I quit nicotine, I keep waking up too early every day, more or less at 5-6 AM getting 6 hours of sleep: is this because of nicotine withdrawal?

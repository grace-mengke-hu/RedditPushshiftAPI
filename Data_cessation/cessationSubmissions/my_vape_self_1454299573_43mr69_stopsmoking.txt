On 1 Feb I am not smoking for the people that missed a quit. Who are you not smoking for?

This started a  long time ago.  The details are below.  But tomorrow on the first of the month, I am going to not smoke in honor of all the people that are almost ready to quit.  How can we help?

Edit:  I have liked BaconReader in the past, but that it is cheerful in deleting 1year old posts is not happy.  Text below.

I was reading [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/2z0f3r/aw_hell_look_at_that_got_a_shiny_new_badge_today/) in my morning.  And I commented that I would not smoke today in honor of the circle 2's.  I like all the badges.

 Of course, I quit smoking for me.  But today I can *honor* the struggles of others while I do what I do.  So today I'll honor those who have gotten those first 14 days down and are starting to face the idea of *never again*.

You guys make me proud.

Edit 2: removed duplicate text.  I shall avoid composing posts on phone for a while :)

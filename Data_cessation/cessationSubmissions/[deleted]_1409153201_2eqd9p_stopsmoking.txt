120 Days - Equals My Quitting Record

I quit for 120 days once before, a couple of years ago after my mother passed away from lung cancer. Then I brilliantly had one cigarette on day 121 and shortly after that started up again of course.

Today is day 120 again... and I have no plans or desire to start smoking again. Even though there are many "triggers" lurking about. Triggers is in quotes because I try to remember there is absolutely NO reason to smoke... ever.

Our eldest cat is not doing well. My vet-tech fiancee is certain he will pass away very soon. I fall apart when my cats are not well. This will be devastating. =(

I hate my job and wish my bosses would be eaten alive by mecha-sharks. And the fact that they won't be upsets me.

We had to spend $500 on tires and car stuff for my stupid car. And I HATE spending money on car stuff! I'd rather spend $500 on a fancy kitty tree, or Star Wars merchandise.

So thanks for reading my rambling, venting post.

If I can make it one more day, I will feel like I really accomplished something and it will help to ensure I keep going! (Just kidding with the "IF"... of course I will make it.)  =)

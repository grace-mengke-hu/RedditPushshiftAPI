It's like a distant memory...

I realized it's been over six months since I willingly put out my last cigarette. Originally I quit with the intentions of starting a family and that was my motivation.  I still haven't managed to get pregnant yet, and I really think that the focus on that has kept my mind off of cigarettes.  Every once in a while I'm reminded that I might be missing it, particularly due to all of my siblings being smokers and hanging out at places that allow smoking, and really just the social aspect of it.  However, I can't stand to be anywhere near the scent of smoke and when I think about even holding a cigarette, it feels so odd and foreign to me, almost like I never smoked in the first place.  The smell is practically gone from my car, too.

I only really thought about how long it's been because a coworker asked me if I have "been good."  Yes.  Yes, I have! And I am giving myself the smallest of pats on the back because, while I don't seem to be good at making a child, I am doing well at staying nicotine free and it feels so great.  Thank you for reading.

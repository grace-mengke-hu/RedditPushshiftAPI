Quitting nicotine as of today

I was laying in bed last night and I really realized how much i fucked up, I am 17 years old, doing college classes and my sleep schedule is fucked to the point of no return. I realized that purging myself of an unhealthy addiction would be a good start to pulling my life out of the gutter, so as of today I'm quitting cold turkey. I have never really had an addiction or tried to quit so I'm not sure what I'm in for, but hopefully it's a little more bearable than I've heard.

Very very scared please help.

Hello.

I am a 25 year old man who quit smoking 6 months ago after having smoked for about 10 years, 12-13 cigarettes per day.

Since a while back I have had mucus in my throat in the mornings which I get get up by clearing my throat. I know this is normal after quitting.

However, this morning there was some blood mixed in with it. Like a clot of blood, mixed with the usual dark brown stuff.

It has happened before but only once, about 2-3 months ago. Now I'm terrified that I have lung cancer or cronic broncitis, COPD etc.

I'm gonna call the doctor tomorrow. But am I overreacting here? I don't know what to do.

Thanks!

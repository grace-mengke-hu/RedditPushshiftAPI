First night, worst night

Smoked my last on Sunday before bed, so last night was my first real night of no smoking. It was awful. It was quite possibly the worst night's sleep I've ever gotten. Every muscle in my body was twitchy, my entire body felt like it wasn't mine, sleep was on and off, dreams were absolutely insane. I nearly got up at 3AM to go buy a pack, it was so crappy.

How long does that shit last? Cause I'm over it.

I need help dear brothers and sisters!

So here's the deal. I've been trying to quit smoking for some time now, but I'm not succeeding. Since the beginning of this year, I've "quit" and relapsed about 4-5 times. 

I think the main problem I have is the following:

Since I was 13, I've been always doing something bad to my health. I've been smoking, drinking, doing drugs and our region's equivalent of chewing tobacco (but not quite the same). The point is, recently I decided to improve myself in all aspects and I successfully got rid of all my vices one by one. But the thing is I quit drugs because I had alcohol, then quit alcohol because I had the tobacco thing and so on. I always had another vice to fall back to, to soften the blow of quitting. But now I find myself with only one vice left and I find it hard to quit it. If I'm finally successful, I'll be poison free for the first time in 17 years. 

But I'm not sure if it's just a weak willpower (i think it is), or my body not being able to process being clean, or is it the taste, the feeling, I'm not entirely sure. 

The longest I've gone without smoking this year was 3 days. The thing I've found out is that it's not the nicotine per se that I'm craving. The things I missed was the first smoke of the day, the kick to back of the throat (for lack of a better expression) and generally the process of holding it to my mouth and blowing out smoke. 

So here I'm my brothers and sisters asking for help. The information I provided might not be entirely necessary, but I thought to give you full background. Have anyone been in a similar situation? Any tips that worked for you and might help me? I really want to quit this time but I think that I lack determination.

Help please!!

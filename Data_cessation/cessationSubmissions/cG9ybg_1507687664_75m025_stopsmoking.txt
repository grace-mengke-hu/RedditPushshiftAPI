After 10 years of smoking, at the age of 25, I'm going through life threatening conditions due to smoking... And I can't stop.

One year ago, I would never had thought that my health would be going to deteriorate so fast, or at least that the symptoms would manifest so much in such short time...

Now here I am... Barely able to do anything, even sitting on the computer is painful... Full of different meds in my system, numb and can't even make sense of what to write... and a cigarette in my mouth.

I was able to stop once for 9 months. For those 9 months I never had a cigarette. Doesn't even seem possible to do that again now. 

I need help, I can't find a way to get the strength in me to stop, but if I don't, I'll probably won't make it to my 30s... I'm physically and emotionally in miserable pain... But still can't stop killing myself.

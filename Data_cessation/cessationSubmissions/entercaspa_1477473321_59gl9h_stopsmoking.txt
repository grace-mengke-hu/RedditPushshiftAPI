wheezing and whistle due to smoking?

Hey guys Ive been trying to quit for a while and I am so close, nearly there, Ive gone from 20 a day to maybe one a week or something when I am drunk and with friends 
but what really made me change this habit was the fact that I am getting a high pitched whistle sound when I breathe out and I was wondering if you guys have experienced this: 

if I open my throat up and mouth and breathe I get a whistle coming out of my windpipe or lungs (just to be clear its not the nose). Ive been to the doctors and they dont think its anything, but Im concerned that it is from all of the smoking ive done the last 6 years.. anyone got this?

100 Days!

Thanks again to /u/my_vape_self for pointing me towards Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking.  I never would have imagined that it could be this easy.  Thanks also to all of you for sharing your stories and giving me strength. 

I am so grateful every day that I was able to break free of that awful evil weed.  When the cravings come, I still take a little glee in poking the "evil bastard" in the eye.  

The cravings are a lot less frequent now, but they still come.  I had one after work this afternoon.  It was hot and sunny outside, and I had to roll down the window for the one of the first times of the year.

The craving came, and I handled it the way I was told to by somebody in here.  I'm sorry to say his/her name escapes me at this point.  I just identified the trigger, and reflected on it for a minute or so.  It passed, just like they always do.  I'm sure that after a few more sunny days I'll roll down the window and not think about smoking.

As I think about it now, I will probably miss my cravings when the last of them are dead and gone.  They make me laugh a little at myself now, and also make me a little proud of how far I've come.

It is a real comfort knowing I have ZERO interest in ever smoking another cigarette or cigar.  My thanks again to all of you who have helped me in my journey, and best of luck all of you who are just starting out.

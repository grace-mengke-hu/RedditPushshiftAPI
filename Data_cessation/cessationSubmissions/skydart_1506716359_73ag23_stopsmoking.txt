On my 5th Day and I'm doing... Not bad.

I feel great, so far I've fought and survived every craving. Even got in an argument with the boyfriend (who is also quitting... inevitable) and while he went outside to have a smoke, I took a single small puff on an e-cig- yes it was a cheat, but it was kind of an emergency.

Here's the problem: Part of my brain still thinks I'll have a cigarette at some point. Like, in a month- I get a cigarette! I know I won't, and I tell that part of my brain, the addict, to shut up, but it just won't listen. Even after Allen Carr, there's a part of me that still WANTS a cigarette, even though logically I find them disgusting. Is this normal? I'm terrified that I'm destined for failure.

EDIT: Weirdly, fidget spinners have helped IMMENSELY.

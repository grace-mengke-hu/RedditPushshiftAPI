Living with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and am also ADHD-PI. Here we go with Day 1.

Honestly,

Smoking has held me together at the seams for 13yrs. I'm 28 now and the smoking just has to stop. I have to many things waging war within me to keep the poison pumping in.

I've tried to quit so many times it's insane lol. I am ruthlessly scared though this time - because the stress of this quit most surely will flare my Chronic Fatigue. Praying that I don't hit the bed long enough to loose all the normal things in life.

Anyway, I wanted to introduce myself and I hope to share in the journey with you folks here soon. Currently at 16hrs.

Thanks.

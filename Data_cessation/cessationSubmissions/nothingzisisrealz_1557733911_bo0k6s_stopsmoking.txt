Unorthodox tactics to help quit smoking

I somewhat accidentally stumbled onto these methods recently in my personal life, and havent had a smoke for a few days now.

1. Buy a pack of smokes that you would usually never smoke, something cheap and disgusting for example.

2. Do what I dub the 'Zorba the Greek' method. Overdo it. Smoke and smoke and smoke again. 

Combine 1. and 2. for optimal effect.

I got so disgusted with cigarettes doing this, its even turning my stomach typing about it right now.

Best of luck to all!

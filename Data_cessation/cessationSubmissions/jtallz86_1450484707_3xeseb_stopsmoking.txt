12 Days and posting to remember

The first few days already feel like the distant past. 

Irritability is still a bit of an issue, but I can honestly say its not even as bad as it would get if, God forbid, someone stopped me on my way out for a smoke or a meeting ran longer than an hour. 

I used to shower twice a day and brushed my teeth incessantly in order to spare my kids and colleagues the stench. Now I realize that hair can smell like shampoo for DAYS, and breath rarely stinks aside from an especially spicy meal or first thing in the morning. My daughter told me I smell "new". I don't know what that means but it's got to be better than before.

I still crave a few times a day, but it's usually silenced by meeting other real needs. I realize now how often I used to ignore hunger, thirst, fatigue, boredom, and anxiety and instead feed nicotine into my system to quiet my body and mind. Imagine if I met my kids cries for sustenance with drops of arsenic. 

I also see now how impatient my husband is. I know I used to share his ongoing frustration with parenting and the like- but somehow now I'm much more level headed and patient. I used the excuse "I can't quit because I'll be a monster to my kids." So many times-  what a load of bullshit. Not even 2 weeks in and my family is better for it.

Should I dare consider "just one" I hope I remember to come and read this.

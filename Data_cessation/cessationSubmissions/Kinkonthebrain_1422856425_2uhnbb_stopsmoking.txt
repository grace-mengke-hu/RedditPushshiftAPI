New here...cause, ya know...don't wanna smoke anymore...

Hello folks! Just now finished the last 'analog' cigarette I have. My **plan** is to utilize the e-cig I have from here on til I run out of juice/filters for it (probably about 2-weeks worth). From there on...nicotine-free!!

I have lurked here a lil and I know some prefer and recommend cold-turkey, others go with NR options (temporarily, like me, or for good). 

I have been down this road before and I know that 'graduating' is what works best for *me*. I dont think it really matters how people get there as long as they keep it **real**.

For those who might be curious about my motivation...I picked tomorrow as my first full day 'analog'-free due to it being my daugther's birthday. A good, constant reminder that I wanna be here and healthy enough to walk her down the aisle and meet my grandkids someday.

As if there weren't 100 other great reasons, I can think of none better. 

It feels good even now...to let it go.  But I know it will surely become harder so expect me to lurk, vent or just kick rocks for awhile here. :)

Cry havoc and release the dogs of war (with cigarettes and nicotine)!!

Made it to day 3: break ups, and the monthly curse...I decided to talk to the ex as the lesser of two evils, but I think it was a mistake.

Is all addiction essentially the same, whether it's to a substance like tobacco or a person?  I decided to quit smoking cold turkey, but considering where I am during the month would it be easier if I taper off my relationship with my ex?  If so, hoe do I ween myself off of him?

Thank you for listening, I am trying so hard.

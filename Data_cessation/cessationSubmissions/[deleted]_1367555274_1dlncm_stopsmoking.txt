I'm fucking losing it, I'm fucking losing it

I'm almost two weeks in, and I'm restless as hell.  I haven't slept a night in the last two weeks without some form of chemical aid.  I've been getting absolutely drunk just to get to bed.  I'm trying to nip that in the bud before it becomes a problem too.  I've been hungover every morning for two weeks.  I've also started gaining weight, despite the fact that I've been obsessed with exercising (it just makes me want to eat more).   




If I hadn't gone and bragged to everybody about quitting smoking, I would have already bought another pack.  But I can't go back now, it's too late.  Nobody would ever believe me again if I said I quit.  I'm incredibly antsy.  I just need a cigarette.  This can't go on.  I've read that this could last up to eight weeks.  I can't do that, but I also can't turn back.  

I can't go back to being a smoker.  I can't go back to hiding it from my parents whenever they come visit me.  I can't go back to having my apartment smell like ash.  I can't go back to lying to myself and saying that I will only smoke outside.  I'm getting a new apartment soon, and I'll be damned if I let one cigarette get lit in that place.


I can't go back to spending a fortune on a worthless piece of shit habit.  I've already spent 3 grand on cigarettes in the two years I've smoked.  The average smoker spends about 114 thousand dollars in their lifetime on cigarettes.  That's enough to make the difference between buying a decent house and buying a nice house.  That's enough to put somebody through college.  That's a life's savings.  



On the other hand, I don't know if I can make it six more weeks like this.  I'm seriously considering getting an e-cigarette right now.  Or maybe just one more pack.


"One more pack," that's a lie and I know it, but I keep trying to tell that to myself.

Quitting nicotine for good, all over again

I'm come here previously for self-accountability regarding use of nicotine products in general, not just smoking. I've had a lengthy issues with tobacco products of different types--smoking first, dipping, back to ecigs, slowly titrating myself down to now to occasional ecig use and nicotine replacement.

It's been a tough journey as I started with the issue when in college, and it all is related to how I started, which was as a stimulant for studying in college--a way to keep myself motivated and stimulated in a very tough school. This continued into graduate school. I've finally made it down to significantly less frequent use, but I am not where I want to be at all.

I'm just kind of stuck with using nicotine gum and ecigs at times when I'm highly stressed or periods of unhappiness in different work situations. For most people, making it this far away from actual cigarettes is a big accomplishment, and it's certainly a good thing. However, my biggest issue is that my use of nicotine is that of an addict and I use it in a way that makes me feel like crap, and I can't stop when I should. Truly, I feel a lot better without it, but I keep giving in.

I'm coming back to try to kick the need for nicotine to get through things. I don't actually feel it's a depression issue, just a coping strategy at this point for tougher times. My goal is to check in as much as I can to help stay away and for general support reasons.

Thanks for just letting me ramble for a bit.

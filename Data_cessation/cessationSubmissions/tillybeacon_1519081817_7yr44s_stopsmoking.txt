Relapse tips? Disappointed in myself!

First post; I’m new here so please let me know if i’m doing anything wrong, thank you!

I’m so disappointed in myself. I gave up about 4 months ago and didn’t touch a cigarette until about 2 weeks ago, but i’m slowly relapsing and am really struggling to get back on track. I really thought this was it, I was so adamant :(

I don’t want to make any excuses because i’m fully aware that it’s my poor choice, but in case this helps, some of the triggers for the relapse include: depression is a bitch. Huge pressure at work. My ecig stopped working and nicotine gum is hurting my jaw. 

I would really appreciate any tips or general reassurance from what seems like a genuinely supportive and knowledgeable sub. Thanks in advance :)

Almost failed last night...

Got a fight with SO, got angry, almost smoked one, but thanks to her, she told me i would regret this. so i didn't, but I felt so weak, being tempted because "there's no way i can handle a situation like this". 

This is bullshit, in fact, i handled that anger faster than when i used to smoke.

This shit is still poison, still bad for my health, and won't help me in anything.

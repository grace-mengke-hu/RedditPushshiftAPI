Relapse after break-up

Broke up with my girlfriend of 6 years so she turns right around and finds a new boyfriend. I was without smoking for over a year, wasn't really keeping track, but now that's over. I'm chain smoking again feeling like Chandler from Friends episode 3 (really funny stuff for smokers trying to quit!). I was going to quit a few days ago but I couldn't do it with all the exams I have coming up. I'm hoping it'll be easier to deal with the initial withdraw when I have a small break from school. Just wanted to share and hopefully I'll be able to have a nice badge come this winter.

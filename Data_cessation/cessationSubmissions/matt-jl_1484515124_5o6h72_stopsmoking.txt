Smoking joints?

Smoking tobacco socially is obviously a dumb thing to do, it doesn't enhance the occasion and it gets you hooked again. Smoking weed is a different matter as it is genuinely an enjoyable experience for me. I don't smoke weed that frequently at all, perhaps 10-15 times a year. I was just wondering if any of you have had joints whilst quitting and how it affected your cravings.

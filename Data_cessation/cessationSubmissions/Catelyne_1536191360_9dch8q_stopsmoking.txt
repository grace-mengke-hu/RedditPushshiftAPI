1 year smoke free

First time posting. Just found this sub. It’s been 1 year for my partner and me. My partner ended up in the hospital with pneumonia quite a lot just before we quit and that was a big motivator. We just wanted to breathe again. It’s great to have kicked the habit and I never plan on going back. But it’s still hard sometimes for me, whenever I’m around other people who still do smoke especially. But after awhile you just don’t think about it so much. For us it was nice to save time. We never smoked in the house so we would always have to take the time to stop what we were doing and have a cigarette. It was quite shocking at first to realize how much extra time you have after quitting. I encourage everyone to stick to your goals! It does get easier eventually. I am also willing to answer any questions that new quitters have, so feel free to ask away!

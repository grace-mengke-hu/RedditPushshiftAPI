Quit back in November.. cravings kicking in now harder than ever. Need advice!!

Hi, Reddit! So I quit on 11-1-17, a little under 4 months ago. I quit on my Nana's birthday and I've only slipped up by taking a drag off of a friends once last month. My problem is the warmer weather. Part of the reason I quit smoking was because I was tired of standing in the cold during freezing Boston winters, but we've had a warm streak and my cravings have been a killer. I can't help but feel like they're related, since so many things I do in the warm weather I'm used to doing with a cigarette (going to the beach, sitting on my deck, driving around with my windows down). Any advice on how to deal with this specific craving? Thanks in advance!

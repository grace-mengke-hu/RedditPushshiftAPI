10 days without a cigarette!!!! Thanks for all the inspiring posts

As a 21 year old who has been smoking for 7 years, it's really hard for me to stay away from cigarettes. Bars, parties, college classes, friends... a lot of people are smoking around me. And as a female, it's very easy to not buy cigarettes and just bum them pretty much anytime and anywhere. After noticing my lungs becoming weak at 21, I had to quit. I can no longer workout without having an asthma attack or coughing a lot. I constantly feel heaving in my chest. After many attempts in the past, I am finally quitting. Thanks to a fellow redditor and quitter, I found a great community to help me out.

Thank you /r/stopsmoking! Reading posts here has really kept me sane over the past 10 days. I hope I will be one of the successful quitters that can come here and spread some inspiration in the future.

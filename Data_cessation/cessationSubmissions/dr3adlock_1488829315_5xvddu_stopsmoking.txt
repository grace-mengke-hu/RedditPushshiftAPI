A week and a day and I'm getting strange aces in my heart?

I gave up 8 days ago after smoking for 13 straight years. Just yesterday and today I have been getting random pains in my heart, nothing serious but uncomfortable. I have just been telling myself it's my hear repairing itself but slightly worried. Anyone else have this?

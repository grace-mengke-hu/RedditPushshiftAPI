One week no smoking

This is actually a big success for me. I subbed here a while ago and have been lurking for a while. Every day I see success story after success story and it's been slowly driving my urge to want to quit smoking. I'd been cutting down for a while and realized I'd only had 6 cigarettes in 2017. So a week ago I made the full quit. It's definitely getting easier.

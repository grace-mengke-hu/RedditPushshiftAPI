37 Days Quit - Why are Cravings so Strong Now?

Good grief I'm about to buy a pack. Today is about the third day in a row where cravings are just over the top and are absorbing all my thought and energy. I'd have thought strong cravings would have occurred early on, but they didn't. Really surprised that 5+ weeks after I smoked my last cig the cravings are stronger now than ever. Gah!!!

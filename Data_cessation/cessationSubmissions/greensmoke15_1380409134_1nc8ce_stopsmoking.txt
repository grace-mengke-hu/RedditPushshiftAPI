Really I just want to scream

I know it is chemistry,  I have felt this way before.  Hollow nerves, panicked breath, a grumpy disposition.  I find crazy reasons to be upset at everything.  Any why?  Because so many time i have just given up and smoked to make the crazy stop.   
This time i choose deep breaths, and confidence that I wont do this to myself again.

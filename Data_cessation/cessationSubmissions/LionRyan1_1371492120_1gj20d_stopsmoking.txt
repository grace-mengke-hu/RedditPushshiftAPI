Tired all the time...

Hey everyone! I was a smoker for 7 years until I quit cold turkey about five days ago. It feels great!

I actually don't have many withdrawal symptoms other than the occasional pang, and don't even feel irritable. The only problem I seem to be facing is that I am just so damn tired. I get enough sleep, even take a nap or two.... but I just feel so lethargic.

Any tips/suggestions for dealing with this? Any idea when this will go away?

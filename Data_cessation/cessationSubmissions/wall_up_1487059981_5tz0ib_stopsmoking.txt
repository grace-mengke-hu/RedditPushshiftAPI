My flair is a lie.

I quit smoking in october of 2014 after 15 years of being a slave to nicotine.  It was one of the hardest things I've done in my life.   I stayed clean for 1.5 years and then I stumbled last july.  I'm not stumbling anymore.  I've just reset my flair.  From here on out valentines day is going to have another meaning for me.  Wish me luck.

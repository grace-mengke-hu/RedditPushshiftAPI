Just officially crossed the 1 day mark

Well first of all this sucks. I'm 19 and I've only been smoking for a year, so I suppose what I'm going through isn't nearly as bad as some of you, but after the first day I feel pretty awful. I've been puffing on an e-cigarette but it doesn't come close to my usual pack of Marlboro 27s every day. It honestly feels like the flu, I'm really achey, my head hurts every time I stand up and my throat feels like it's been scraped raw, which, let's be honest, it has.

Still, the benefits are already starting to come around. My blood pressure is going further and further down to normal levels, and my god, my sense of smell is really coming around. My neighbor lit a cigarette on her back porch, all the time I was smoking I never realized how much those suckers SMELL.

Glad to be quitting!

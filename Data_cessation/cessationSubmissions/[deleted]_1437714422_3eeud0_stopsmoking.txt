I had quit for four months (used the patches and mentos), but my stress level has been so high. I started again. When the situation I'm dealing with goes away, will it be easier to stop again? Details in post.

Long story short:


My roommate is a crazy bitch. 


We moved into our very first home together, about a little over two weeks ago (she wanted to get away from her ex-boyfriend)


Well, she got back with him and has now decided to break the lease that has both our names on it.  She is being responsible in the sense that she is going to pay all of her half of the remaining rent, but she is having to take out a loan to do so, just so she can move in with her dickhead boyfriend. 



I have accepted this. I'm financially stable. But she threatened to stab me last Saturday and I started smoking again. She is moving out by the end of this month. Will it be easy to quit?

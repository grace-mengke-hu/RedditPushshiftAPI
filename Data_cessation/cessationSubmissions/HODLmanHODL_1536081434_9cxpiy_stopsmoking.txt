Never give up! This is my 15th attempt to quit but I’m doing well this time!

So I’ve managed over 6 weeks smoke free at this point. I’ve managed to quit many times but only lasted for a week or two, before picking up the cigarettes again. I am determined not todo this again. I read TOO many times how people quit for a week, a month, a year, sometimes longer before starting up again. Not me!



My advice is:


Take everyday at a time. Load up with a nicotine replacement therapy (mine was e-cigs) and smoke the **** out of it! Lol.  I much preferred it to cigarettes in the end as I could smoke it at my workplace, in the car with my children, wherever - constant nicotine hits at a cheaper price. That’s what I realised - you don’t even enjoy smoking - it’s just the gremlins telling you that in your head and the nicotine hit.

After 2 weeks on the e-cig I lost it (still can’t find it to this day.) 

decided to apply the same logic again, one step at a time. I went 1 hour without it, then 2 hours, then 24 hours (knowing 48hours nicotine will be out my system). Once 48 hours came; it seemed stupid to start up again, and I’ve kept that logic ever since. 



Also want to say I’ve got more money, the FREEDOM you have is amazing. Like, I can spend the whole day with my children now not having to think about where I’m having my next cig. 

As I type this I wouldn’t mind having a cigarette. But I’m not going to. Because I know that the urge will pass. I am breaking It down again; 10 minutes; then 30 mins; then before I know it I won’t want a cigarette again.

Stay strong!

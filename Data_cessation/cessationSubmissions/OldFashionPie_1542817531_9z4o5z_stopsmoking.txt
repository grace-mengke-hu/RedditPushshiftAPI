Cigarette sickness

I was a pack a day smoker for months straight until recently I got sick and came down with a fever. I had a bad cough before the fever but continued to smoke through it. The cold sweaty fever of 102 degrees lasted 2 days and I didn’t want to smoke at all! Now a week later I plan on not carrying a lighter around unless I’m shooting bottle rockets! If you think you can, you must!

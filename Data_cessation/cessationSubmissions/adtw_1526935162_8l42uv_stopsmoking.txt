24 years old with congestive heart failure

Been smoking since I was 14. Found out today I'd had undiagnosed hypertension the whole time, which I wouldn't have had if I wasn't a smoker. Also found out today I have an enlarged left ventricle. And because it's been so bad for so long, I have congestive heart failure.

Smoking will kill you faster than you think.

P.S. day 1 for me.

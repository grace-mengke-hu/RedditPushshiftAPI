Day 2 today...

  TLDR- supplements, tips wanted to detox body and get over cravings. 

Quit smoking on a whim the other day as I have pneumonia and it was not helping my cough!! I realized I’m way sicker then I would be if I didn’t smoke. Quit with my husband last summer using Champix but that messed my head badly and I started again.  I’m using the patch as that worked for me years ago when I quit for 6 months. 
Anyhow, right now I just feel like I’m forgetting to do something but the odd time it will pop into my head that I should be smoking. I’ve been taking Vit C at those times as I’ve heard it helps to flush the system? Anything else I can do to flush this poison out faster? 
Wow that was super rambly, thanks for reading!!

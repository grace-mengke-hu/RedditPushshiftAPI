day zero / bc of severe shortness of breath terrifying the living hell out of me

after several rabbit holes down the google search of COPD, and bc i havent been able to breathe properly for like.. a week now (partly also thanks to anxiety) i've decided to try and quit smoking after being a regular for years. is this level of shortness of breath normal?

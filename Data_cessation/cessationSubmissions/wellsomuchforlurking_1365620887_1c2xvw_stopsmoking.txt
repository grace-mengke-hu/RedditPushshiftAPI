I really need a full night's sleep. Is that too much to ask???!!!

Day 16 here. I am able to fall asleep, but I usually wake up at 11:30, 2 am, 3 am, 4 am, 5 am and finally get up around 6 am. I started working out again last week to see if it would help my sleeping issues and it hasn't. NyQuill wears off and so does Advil PMs. I do not consume caffeine after 10 am, haven't been drinking alcohol before bed, no electronics, etc.

I haven't tried melatonin or anything yet, but I might go to the health food store tonight. This is my 3rd time quitting and I didn't have these issues before!

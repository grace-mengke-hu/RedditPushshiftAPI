"WARNING" - Allen Carr

"WARNING:

Perhaps you are somewhat apprehensive about reading [this book](http://media.wix.com/ugd/74fa87_2010cc5496521431188f905b7234a829.pdf).  Perhaps, like the majority of smokers, the mere thought of stopping fills you with panic and although you have every intention of 
stopping one day, it is not today.

If you are expecting me to inform you of the terrible health risks that  smokers run, that smokers spend a small fortune during their smoking lives, that it is a filthy, disgusting habit and that you are a stupid, spineless, weak-willed jellyfish, then I must disappoint you. Those tactics never helped me to quit and if they were going to help you, you would already have quit.

My method, which I shall refer to as [EASYWAY](http://media.wix.com/ugd/74fa87_2010cc5496521431188f905b7234a829.pdf) doesn't work that  way. Some of the things that I 
am about to say, you might find difficult  to believe. However by the time you've finished the book, you'll not only  believe them, but wonder how you could ever have been brainwashed into believing otherwise."

111 Days, now for the next step (pun inbound)

I have taken the next step toward a better self. I started the c25k program, and made my first post over at r/c25k. 

Made it 1.5 miles in 30 mins on the first day. This is a fair starting point, but I hope to report back on great success in phase 2 of "u/brokenprism 2.0"

Missed day 1 again

Woke up with a craving for a smoke. I put the craving away well but it can back and hour later and I lit up. It seems like losing that one habit made the other ones I'm trying to improve fall out too. I handed my pack over to my mom but now am basically high as. fuck and it's not cool.

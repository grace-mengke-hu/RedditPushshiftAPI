How do I make myself WANT to stop?

I've been smoking since the age of 13 (22 now) and the longest I've ever gone without cigarettes is about a week. Since I started university I've felt like the odd one out because virtually no one on my course smokes. My mother is an ex-smoker and she suffers from really bad COPD now, she finds it hard to walk anywhere without coughing her guts up. Recently I've been getting some pretty shitty coughs myself. Despite all this I still don't feel like I actually WANT to stop even though my body is telling me I should and I'm constantly reminded of it in social situations as most of my friends these days are non-smokers...

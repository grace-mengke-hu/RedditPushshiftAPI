4 days.

I'm starting to break out now. I'm extremely pleased, but emotional. It's starting to become obvious that something you've done for 3+ years isn't going to go away overnight. 1,222  days vs. 4. This isn't going to be easy. 

I'm learning how to say no to myself. For every bad habit that I've dropped, I've picked up another to deal with stress. Today was the literal definition of a negative feedback loop until I became aware of it. 

I can taste better. I can breathe better. I cough more. I'm excited. Today was actual hell with my emotions. I feel overconfident, and tmi...  but sex is better. Better blood flow, less dehydration. You do the math. :) I could get used to this. This isn't my first quit attempt. I've never quit more than 5 days I think? I forget a lot of things. I was disassociating quite a bit. I feel extremely floaty, lightheaded and dizzy at various points. I had a panic attack. It was funny though, those things stop or lessen when my brain realizes that I'm not going to solve those problems with a cigarette. 

I'm going to have the biggest dopamine rush of my life if I keep it up till Tuesday for reasons. :&gt; I'm not used to wanting something badly like this or having goals. I could get used to this. :)

I realized that young dumbass me probably stunted my hormonal development by messing with my cortisol levels. It was a pack a day or more at 105lbs from 19 to 22. Things are probably going to change in my weight levels, frontal lobe usage, and general mood in general. I also have way too much time on my hands. I played a song on the piano that I haven't been able to play in years recently. I started drawing and writing poetry again. I will probably try doing more of that to pass the time. 

I can allow myself to feel good things. I can forgive myself for my mistakes. It's going to be ok. I'm still on day 4. I wonder if my brain will start looking for longer term solutions since I've stop patching the holes in my boat.

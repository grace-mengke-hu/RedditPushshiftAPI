Is hookah going to be a gateway back to cigarettes?

I have the most beautiful Hookah my sister sent to me while she was in Afghanistan. I loved smoking it! I haven't touched it since I quit smoking back in January... I was thinking about firing it up but definitely don't want to do it if it's just going to make me want to smoke cigarettes again.

Thoughts?

I am finally out of tobacco and I'm going to try my best not to purchase more. I have been smoking off and on for the last 20 years. When I was a teenager I hung out with this girl Tasha that taught me how to inhale. We would take half-smoked cigarettes from her grandma's ashtray and hide in her room and smoke them. Later I would spend time at a girl Sarah's house and her parents gave her a pack of Marlboro reds every week for doing chores. My friend Meghan and I would smoke Black and Milds and all these years later she still smokes them. I remember switching to Camel Special Lights because the package was pretty. Camel Turkish Gold. Then I switched to Parliament because they had that cool filter. For the past several years I have been using American Spirit organic in the turquoise box, they made me feel like I was somehow making a better choice because they didn't contain additives. But it's all tobacco and it's all bad. There's nothing about smoking that made me feel good except for that first drag. After that it was guilt. I know I deserve to live the rest of my life without these sticks invading my health. Anybody else cough up brown mucus? I no longer have to worry about actively harming my health and that feels good.

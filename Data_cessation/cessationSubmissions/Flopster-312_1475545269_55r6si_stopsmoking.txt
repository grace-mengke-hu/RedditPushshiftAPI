Things to do when you think about smoking ;

29 days and 17 hours smoke free, how is it feeling? Like a charm, going to smoke again? Never!

Since the day I quit I didn't have any craving, I think I was morally so prepared and convinced about quitting that I bypassed the cravings, but to be honest, there isn't a day since I quit that I didnâ€™t think about smoking, I don't want to smoke, but somehow I always remember cigarettes, 9 years of smoking isn't a little, and some things were always linked to smoking, so I thought about sharing with you what worked for me, how I replaced some reflexes ; 

Things I did immediately after quitting ; 
- Throw away all ashtrays and lighters 
- clean the house, the bedroom and the car and try to remove the smell of smoke as much as possible ( I cleared my room, threw away all the things I don't need anymore, painted the walls and reorganized it in a new way) 
- I moved the fourniture, in a way that nothing looks the same as before anymore, make it a new lifestyle.
- I washed all the clothes I have so they become fresh.
- I avoided going to closed places where people smoke a lot, crowded bars and clubs, I replaced those with parks and open air tea housses, replaced coffee with tea or juice, and finally replaced cigarettes with potato chips, popcorn or dark chocolate.
- You can kick an ashtray of your house, but you can't kick a best friend of your life just because they smoke, and for me, I made some new rules, I asked them to help me by avoiding smoking near me in a closed area.


Things I do when I think of smoking ;
- I bought chewing gum bottles and placed them everywhere I might be, each time I think of cigarettes, I'd grab a gum and chew it, and I simply love how hot and fresh the gum is and unconsciously compare it with the taste, smell of cigarettes and smile.
- sunflower seeds are really addictive and full of vitamins, that's my new companion for movies and tv shows
- exercise for five minutes 
- shower
- going for a walk, a run or a ride on the bike
- this is my favorite task, I made a small bucket where I daily throw money, the money I used to waste on cigarettes, I love grabbing some of that money, go out and buy something, it doesn't matter what it is, I bought books and magazines, guitar picks, a USB car charger, ice cream, even a cactus, it feels so beautiful each time to reward myself, to spend money on something that makes me happy instead of wasting it to kill myself.

If I can do it, anyone can, good luck guys and never lose hope!

Please share with me your tips and what worked for you!

First day of the rest of my life.

Well after being a heavy smoker of 8 years I'm finally quitting.  I've been lurking on this subreddit some for quite a while now and seeing all of your stories have really encouraged me to take control of my health and my life.  Today is the day I quit slowly killing myself.  Today is my first day of fresh air.  Today I am a quitter!

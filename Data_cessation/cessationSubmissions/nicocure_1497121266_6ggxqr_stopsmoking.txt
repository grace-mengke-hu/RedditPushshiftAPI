PSA: Beware of the "I smoked again and hated it" posts

Trying that one cigarette to convince yourself that you successfully quit is also *the reason most quitters go back to smoking*. It might feel disgusting but so did your first cigarette ever. It gets nicotine inside your bloodstream again.

If you are a non-smoker, there's no reason to test yourself with that one cigarette.

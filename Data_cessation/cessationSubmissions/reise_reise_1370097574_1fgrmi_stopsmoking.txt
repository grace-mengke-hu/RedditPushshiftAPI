Hi r/stopsmoking. I'm finally quitting tomorrow.

I've tried to quit before, cold turkey, patches, gum, everything but tomorrow I'm going to try my best to quit for good and do everything I can to stick to it. I'm not statistically classified as a "heavy smoker" - I smoke around 7-8 a day, which is still not good. I'm only 18, almost 19 and I've been smoking for around 3-3 1/2 years. 

I've downloaded some apps, I'm going to keep track of how much money it saves me and I've put some steps into place to make it as hassle-free as possible. I'm worried more so about being a grumpy bastard, and avoiding the craving in social situations. That's probably what I need the most advice for.

I enjoy smoking, but I hate it at the same time. It's probably a little too ambitious to think tomorrow will be my last day in life smoking a cigarette, but I definitely do NOT want to go back to this habit, having a dependency on being able to smoke when I'm stressed, or not feeling complete without a cigarette to go with my beer or my coffee.

So, r/stopsmoking, I'm ready to do my best! The advice I need the most - directed at ex-smokers/smokers trying to quit (or anyone who can relate and offer advice), what's the best way you've learned to adjust to kick the habit when it comes to social situations? I feel like I won't enjoy my coffees, drunken birthday parties and social gatherings with few drinks as much without a smoke, but I know if I make some excuse like "oh, I'll just have ONE with a coffee.." it'll turn into an addiction all over again.

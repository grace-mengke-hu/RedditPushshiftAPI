Am I cheating?

I committed to being a non-smoker Monday and haven't had a cig since, hooray!

HOWEVER, I have been using a vape pen to manage the nicotine withdrawal. I know that I am only prolonging the withdrawal of nicotine but I guess I feel like I didn't actually "quit" smoking.

What do you guys think?

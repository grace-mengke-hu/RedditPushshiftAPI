One year! I finally get to do this.

Sorry for adding to the faceless millions making these posts. The opportunity to submit one some day was a big motivator for me. 


Seriously, to those currently in agony: it gets so, so, so much better. Things honestly get easy over time. Just power through it. People lesser than you have quit. If you ever want to quit for good, you'll have to go through this struggle no matter what. Make this struggle the last struggle. It's all about getting over the hump, and it's all downhill from there.


Stay strong, and I'm here to offer any support anyone may need.

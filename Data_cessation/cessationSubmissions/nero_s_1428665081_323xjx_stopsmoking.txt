triple digits!!!

nothing more to say really! I quit cold turkey and most of the time I don't think about smoking at all, only when I am having a beer around smokers. Only contra I can think off is that I have to keep my fingers busy when I am around smokers, but that's about it. Health, sleep and mood increased. 

Good luck to all of you!!

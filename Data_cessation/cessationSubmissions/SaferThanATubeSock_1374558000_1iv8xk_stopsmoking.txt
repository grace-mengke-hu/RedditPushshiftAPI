50 Days Without Smoking

This is officially the longest I've ever gone without smoking. My cake day was 2 days ago, but this is all the cake I need!! I've been smoking for 8 years and never thought I could do it. Don't plan it, just do it. Cold turkey. If I could do it, so can you!

It isn't just about feeling better, it's knowing that you have control over your health again...and it feels fucking great!

Best of luck to all.

Resetting my badge

I don't know what my badge will say at the time that you read this but I had to reset it, but for a GOOD reason. I originally requested one on the day I started using nicotine patches, well I only used it for about 2 days then skipped a week or so and was smoking... but I finally am using them correctly now. So far, this is the first time in over 7 years that tobacco smoke hasn't enter my lungs.... it's been about 36 hours smoke free. I'm just proud of myself. I may reset my badge once I'm off the patch too. I haven't decided. I'm staying quit this time.

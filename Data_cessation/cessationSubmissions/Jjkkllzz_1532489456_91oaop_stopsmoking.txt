Why do I want to smoke so badly today?

It’s been over 50 days and the last few weeks I haven’t thought about cigarettes much at all. Today, though. I’m not stressed out or anything as far as I can tell. I’ve been eating a lot today to quench the cravings, which really sucks because I’ve spent the last month really paying attention to my diet and exercise. I feel completely disgusting for how much food I ate. I’m not going to smoke. I just needed to vent. I know the feeling will go away, just struggling to understand why it’s here at all right now. Ugh.

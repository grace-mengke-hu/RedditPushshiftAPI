The dreaded holiday.

Well the day has arrived,  already I have busied myself with cooking, at 9am..... I am fine until I sit down after one task done,  and what happens... the thought, "it's time for a cigarette".  Followed by, "u dont smoke anymore"  and then finally "oh shit!  How will I ever make it through the day"  I take a look at my smoke free app... 3 days, 15 hrs, 21 mins.... do I really want to give that up?  Its tempting,  but no,  not at this time.... how long do i have to tell myself this before every part of me believes it?  My addict mind says,  "smoking wasnt that bad,  it's not like ur dying from it."... then the rational part of my brain says, "that's the point stupid!,  you dont want to end up like ur parents and be dead by 48 or 50.... ur already 33! And have been smoking for 15 years!  That's excessive!  And no u cant be a social smoker cuz u cant handle just having 1 every once in a while" then my addict mind finally crosses her arms like a child having a tantrum and shuts up..... for now

Really desperate to get a smoke when I realized something

So I threw my package away yesterday. And the only way for me to buy a new one is by doing a 30 minute drive ( I live in the country ). And I can only drive there in the morning ( 8 am ) , since I am quite busy atm and can't afford to go there at later times. 

I was very desperate for a cig and was thinking about driving there tomorrow, even though I didn't really feel like driving so far early in the morning. But after thinking about doing it for the whole day I asked myself " Is it really worth all the trouble? Just to get a smoke? " Then I realized, I am not forced to this. It is MY decision to go there. This is MY life and I decide about my life and not a stupid cigarette.


Think about how much we go through just to statisfy our addiction . I mean I would go outside and freeze my ass off in the cold just to smoke a cigarette. Oh, what a pleasure smoking is...










Also, I'd like to apologize for my english (not a native speaker).

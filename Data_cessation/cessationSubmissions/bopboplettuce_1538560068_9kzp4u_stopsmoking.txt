I guess I should post here.

I haven't subscribed. I haven't committed. But I figured if anyone could get me to finally quit, it'd be this place and you people. I'm seventeen. Ive been smoking consistently since I was 12, but smoked my first cigarette at 10. Now I'm married and have a 3 month old daughter and quite frankly, I'm tired of smelling like cigarettes. I'm tired of feeling guilty for asking people for then. I'm tired of being paranoid of getting my friends in trouble for giving them to me. 
For the past 6 months or so, I've been saying that I will quit as soon as I can get a vape and start lowering the nicotine in it until I'm nicotine-free. I haven't been able to access one at all and I'm losing hope on it. 
When I go too long without cigarettes, I get irritated about nothing, I have major mood swings, and overall it isn't pleasant. Nobody likes me without a smoke. I hate it and I hate the way I am without them. But even more than that I hate smoking them. 
I don't know where to start or how to do it. I have one cigarette left for tonight and I'm hoping to maybe convince myself to quit tomorrow when I wake up. Any words of advice or encouragement are completely welcome.

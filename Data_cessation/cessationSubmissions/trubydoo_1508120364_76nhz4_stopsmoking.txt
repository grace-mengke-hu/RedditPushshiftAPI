Quitting again!

Hey everybody. I'm new to this sub, so I apologize for any faux pas.

I recently started smoking again after over a year of being smoke free. Before that I had smoked for about 10 years. I'm 30 now and I want to start taking care of my body, but, it's hard.

I remember now all the things I hated about being a smoker. The shortness of breath, the constant anger with myself and my weakness, always smelling like smoke and the ever-present ashtray taste in my mouth. I know you are all very aware of the plight of being a smoker, and so I thought this would be a great place to come for support and advice!

Basically I'm here to talk to like-minded people and share experiences and ideas about quitting. I'm going cold turkey tomorrow, because that's the way that I quit last time and it worked for me. How did you all quit?

Thanks for reading :)

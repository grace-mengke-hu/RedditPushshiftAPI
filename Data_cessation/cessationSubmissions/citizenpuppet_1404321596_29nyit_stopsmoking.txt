Reddit, I have 9 cigarettes left in my pack and I want to quit. What the hell do I do?

I've tried and failed and tried again, and I just want the fuck out of this. I read the Allan Carr book, I've gone three years without them, but I always end up back suckling on the tit. I don't want to stop drinking alcohol, though. 

For the heavy hitters out there, please show me the way so that I don't smoke these 9 cigarettes. 

* One more thing, I'm at work (point of the most cigs smoked and site of the most cigs bummed when I don't have any) for the next 5.5 hours. 

* Also, fellow potheads who quit - I don't want to stop rocking the ganj. Any helpful hints beyond edibles?

I "quit" again, and I'm pretty sure it'll stick this time!

I've been reluctant to post before now because I've quit previously and, in any case, I still occasionally have a longing for the grossness that is a cigarette. Still, it's been long enough now that I think I'm good to say I've actually quit.

One fairly major caveat, though - I'm still vaping. Granted, it's been something like two months and I go six hours with no nicotine at any given stretch and I've cut the level way down (I started at full strength and I'm now down to 6mg), but it's working. Once this liquid is done, I'll move down again to 0mg for a bit to help wean me off the fixation.

Dunno if it's appropriate here, but for those of you thinking of quitting the way I am, here are a few things I've noticed (quit for 4 years before, and went cold turkey then). First, it doesn't help everyone, but it helped/is helping me. Second, spring for the higher end. So ... no guilty smoking dreams. No smoke smell all over everything you own, no little bits of ash everywhere, no cigarettes half-smoked before you were aware you'd lit up. No bumming, no urgency to get to the store "just in case." No headaches. Very little bitchiness. Still have cravings, but not nearly as frequent.

Thing is (and this is the reason for "quit" in the title), you'll always be in a perpetual state of smoker-that-doesn't-smoke. You're addicted, and addicts have a nasty habit (pardon the unintended wordplay) of succumbing to a long-forgotten craving, and it can be the stupidest thing that convinces you to have "just one more," even years after you thought you were done. Keep with it. It sucks at first, but you'll get through it. I may have a crutch still but I'll not need it soon, and you CAN quit. It's genuinely with the effort.

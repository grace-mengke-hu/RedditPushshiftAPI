What can I use to remove the yellow cigarette residue from things?

Not a smoker, but I figured you guys might have some suggestions (and this could be helpful to anyone stopping smoking!). I recently purchased a car from my aunt, who was a smoker. She sold it to me for very cheap, but the car is *covered* with that yellow residue cigarettes can leave. All of the buttons, the steering wheel, and the door handles are covered, and it feels gross to touch and leaves residue on my fingers.

What can I use to remove this gunk? Looking for something effective that preferably won't take a bunch of scrubbing. I've tried regular soap and water, cleaning wipes, and bleach, to no effect.

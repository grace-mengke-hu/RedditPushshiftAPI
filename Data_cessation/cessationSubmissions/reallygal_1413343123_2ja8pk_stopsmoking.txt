Relapse after 5 years. Time to quit again for good

I used to be a pack a day smoker for 8 years,  and then I quit on Oct 6, 2009, I did not have a single puff till 3 months ago.  I had mistakenly thought I could have just another puff,  that I can be never addicted again.  Well I was so wrong,  I started smoking more and more,  had 2 packs today. I dont want to be smoker anymore,  so here I am day 1 again,  hoping to quit for life this time

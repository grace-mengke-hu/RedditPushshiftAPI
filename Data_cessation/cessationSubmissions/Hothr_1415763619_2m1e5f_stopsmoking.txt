Help, I have a wonderful smoke spot that I want to enjoy

I just moved into a new apartment, which has a beautiful private roof deck and a fantastic view.  I moved in yesterday, and I've been going up 3 times a day, wishing I could just enjoy the view over a smoke.  (I pledged to myself to quit when I moved a couple days ago)  Smoking is the best way I know how to enjoy 5 minute outdoor breaks.  What can I do to enjoy my spot without going back to my habit?

Need to quit in 4 weeks how to I make the final push?

So basically I've been offered a new job and I'm very excited feeling motivated, its going to be a great start to the new year. Currently I work night shifts and my general motivation and routine has been lacking for some time, I've handed in my 4 week notice and the new job I start is a great opportunity for me but also much more sociable hours so I will be able to kick start a better routine e.g. Walking to work and generally being more active having time to actually plan hobbies and sports. The bad news is I'm a smoker (around 10-15 a day), Christmas is coming up which means lots of socialising and drinking, but I don't want to start the new job hooked on the stupid things any longer. I want my focus to be learning and enjoying the job, not worrying about how often I can get a cig break or smelling like stale cigs around my new colleagues. My start date is 18th Jan, currently I'm thinking I should wait til NYs is out the way so there's less temptation and my only focus will be on this new job, is this a good plan or does anyone have better advice? Any help much appreciated!

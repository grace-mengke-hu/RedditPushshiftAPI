First Day

Hey! Guys I'm new here It's 2am on my second day not smoking. I'm laying in my bed trying to think of anything other than those dirty frigging darts. It's already been tough but let's hope I can stick with this! I'm doing this cold turkey no patches no e cigs nothing. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

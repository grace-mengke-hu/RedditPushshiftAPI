It's been 6 months...

I've never posted here. Always been a lurker because when I was smoking I really really wanted to stop and stumbled into ya'll. I'd like to give this subreddit credit for me accomplishing this goal.

I know I might sound like a broken record, but it's mostly because of that damn Alan Carr book. I only read it in defiance really. I figured, there was no way a book would convince me to stop.

All it was was a perspective change really. I'm done. Thank's to you guys. 

6 months later, I don't think about it. Never had a craving. It really was/is easy. When I think about smoking, I feel like I wouldn't even know how to do it anymore. I try to imagine smoking now and I can't even really conceptualize the logistics anymore.

This is coming from a guy who identified himself and was proud of his smoking career. I LOVED it. And DEFENDED it! Now it's as if that period of my life never happened.

I'm bringing this up mostly because my co-worker, who is in the process of quitting, had a rough day and was really craving hard. He's baffled by my restraint because I was the biggest smoker in our circle. It was a part of my persona really. 

This guy isn't just a co-worker. He's a dear friend and he's being going strong for about a month now. Today I told him if he breaks and smokes another fuggin' cigarette, he'd force me to light up with him. Because of this agreement and our mutual respect, I'm certain we have prevented another person from breaking. He started reading the book this evening, and he's a smart dude. He'll be just as done as me and you. 

All I really want to say is...

Thank you.

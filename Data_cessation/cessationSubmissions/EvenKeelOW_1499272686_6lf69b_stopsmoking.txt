Need help. 21 yr. Smoker, failed numerous times. SmH at this point.

So here I am in my work truck, 6 cigs left in the pack. I am a solid pack a day, more when I drink. 

  I have tried many times. The best I have a done is 1yr when I lived with my sister who despised cigarettes. I did it cold turkey, but as soon as I found a social circle, I was back at it.

  Right now I am smoking heavily. Going through divorce bit still living with the ex and step kids. I have been going out nightly, to get my mind off it all.

  What is funny is I am super fit. I run 2-6 miles a week, play basketball several times a week, work out, hike, etc. You would never take me for a smoker.

  I have the shittiest willpower. I have tried: vaping, seeds, kratom pills, weed, not drinking, etc. I am at the point where I may consider Chantix, but HATE taking pharma drugs.

  Lastly I should note that I don't have an addictive personality. I can quit drinking, weed, etc no problem. My mother smoked while she was pregnant with me so sometimes I feel like it is engrained in my DNA. 

  I'd love some advice, help, support.

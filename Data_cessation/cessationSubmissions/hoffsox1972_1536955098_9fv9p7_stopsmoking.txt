Energy Level

I need some serious motivation from the group. For those who have quit smoking, please tell me how much your energy levels have changed. Long time smoker here and I am so tired lately, especially at night after work, and I have a desk job! I did recently have major surgery which has limited my physical activity so I'm looking for motivation on how quitting smoking alone has changed your energy level. Thank you!

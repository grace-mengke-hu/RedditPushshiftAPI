Music and smoking

I've been a smoker for 20 years and my favourite habit was putting on a good song, light up a cig and daydream for 5-10 minutes. 
   And I'll be honest I miss it. A good song triggers me to no end and I miss it, the music &amp; smoking &amp; the daydream. I tried alcohol insted of smoking but it's not sustainable in the long run.

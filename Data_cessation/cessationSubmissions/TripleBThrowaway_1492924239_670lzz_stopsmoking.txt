Want to know what's better than a cigarette?

Every single day not smoking one, the anxiety smoothes away. It's a distant thought, not a yearning when I think about cigarettes. More of just a memory, "Oh yeah, You smoked cigs for seven years, that shit was meh". If you can last a minute without smoking, you can last a lifetime.

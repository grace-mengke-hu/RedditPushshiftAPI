Trying to quit

Well I'm in a situation where i won't be able to consume tobacco the way i want on a vacation so i'm quitting beforhand so i dont go through withdrawls in paradise.  Is there anything that can give me the same sensation as smoking tobacco through a water pipe?  I have tried high mg nicotine vape and i just can't seem to get an relief from it, it just makes me want to smoke.

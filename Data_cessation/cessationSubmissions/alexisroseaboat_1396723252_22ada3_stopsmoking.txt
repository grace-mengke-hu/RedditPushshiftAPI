It's been 6 days!

I want to thank all of you for helping me make it this far! I smoked for 5 years before deciding to quit for good. Part of making it this far was me, but the other part was reading all the inspiring stories from those of you that are further along in this journey than I am. I've tried to quit before, this time I am quitting.

Thank you all for the inspiration.

Are colds worse after having quit smoking vs prior to smoking?

I have gotten two colds in the last year and they are the fucking worst ones I can remember. Is so beyond what I remembered. So much phlegm and sore throat and pain. No amount of cough syrup and tea is doing any fucking good. I am afraid to sleep lest I choke on the amount of crap in my throat.

Granted it is far better than if I was still smoking but the last few have been a dozy.

Last smoke this morning.

So just finished a packet of rolling tobacco and I've decided that enough is enough. I've been smoking for 8 years now, and other than a period of 4 months when I quit, I've not gone a day without them.

/r/leaves help me quit weed which was important because weed is kinda what made me relapse when I tried to quit smokes before. Been off weed ow for 4 months.

So here is my game plan:

Got an ecig and 12MG liquid. I'm going to buy some 0 nicotine liquid as well as slowly dilute it over the next 2-3 months until I'm just vaping fruit juice.

My main motivation for quitting is that most nice girls think its disgusting and I only like nice girls.

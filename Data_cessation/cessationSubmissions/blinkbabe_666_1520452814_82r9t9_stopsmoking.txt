Anyone else on Champix having problems sleeping?

I have been taking Champix for about three weeks, with a lot of problems falling asleep or staying asleep. Some recommend taking melatonin capsules before bed, but it I feel like I would rather take no pills than two. I can't be the only one not sleeping can I?

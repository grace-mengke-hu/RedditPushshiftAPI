Feeling of Pit in Stomach Waiting to be Filled.

Hi Reddit,

I quit smoking cold turkey 29 days ago. I am 22 and was smoking a bout a pack a day of mid strength cigarettes for the better part of the last 6 years.

Over the last couple of weeks i have had this horrendous hollow feeling in my stomach, its like it needs a deep inhalation of smoke but of course ill never pick up another cig.

How do i make this feeling go away? I have been treating it with alcohol which has lead to sleep deprivation and alcohol abuse. I just feel like my body is rejecting not having any vices.

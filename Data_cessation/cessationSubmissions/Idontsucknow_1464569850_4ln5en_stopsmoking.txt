Where are these cravings coming from??

I hope this post isn't demoralising for anyone...I gave up nearly 5 months ago, and I have been really positive up until now. I'm as anxious as fuck right now and I swear if someone doesn't talk me off the ledge in the very near future, I'm going up to the shop to buy some. 

I don't know where it's coming from. I am so fit right now, I just ran a 10k race in 52 mins, and this weekend coming I have a 14k race. I'm having massive social anxiety and trouble dealing with some people right now, but they're not even in my immediate family, so they shouldn't register as that important. Nothing has happened really, just the usual INFJ angst. I have come a long way, but I'm kind of feeling like what's the point. I consciously know nicotine was making me more anxious and not helping etc etc, but I really want to feel better :(

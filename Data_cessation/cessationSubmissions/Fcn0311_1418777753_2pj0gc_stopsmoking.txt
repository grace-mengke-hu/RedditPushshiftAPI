20 days quit can't believe it so chuffed

I'm using smoke free app, going great, after many many quit attempts and last 2 of the 22 yrs at 30 a day too... Tonight I'm at 600 cigs not smoked and loads of money saved. I'm easily irritated this week, I hope that passes ?  Can I post a pic of my smoke free status on here ?

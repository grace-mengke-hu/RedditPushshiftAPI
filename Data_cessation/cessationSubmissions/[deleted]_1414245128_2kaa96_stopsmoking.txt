6 days!!!

Today is my 6th day I started when I was 12 I'm now 25 and smoke around 30-40 roll ups a day well did!! I'm having some real bad days emotional angry tense head aches not sleeping at all don't know what to do with myself some time and I have good days wher I feel full of energy and feel on top of the world but what ever I'm feeling whether it's a bad day or a good day I just keep thinking to my self smoking is actualy seriously bad and not to have a fag if it makes me feel like this without them what is it doing to my body with them!!! Some times I pig out to help a craves some times I listen to music others I'll read or go for a walk!! I just hope I can keep up the positive attitude through out the rest of my life!! After all it's a long time and I no I will always have apart of me that misses it but I spose that's the choice I made when I piked up my first fag knowing it was addictive :-( hope my kids don't touch the stuff

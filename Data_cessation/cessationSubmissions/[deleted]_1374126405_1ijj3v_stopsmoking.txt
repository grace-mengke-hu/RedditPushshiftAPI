And here we go...

Woke up this morning and thought to myself "I don't want to keep smoking any more" even though I enjoy it. I just don't want to spend the money on it. No horrible health effects, no family being killed by it, no guilting from anyone, I just want to spend that money on other things like holidays and video games.

Been smoking for 7 years and haven't tried to quit once so I don't know how well it will go for me. My husband tried to quit last year and tried everything, but it wouldn't stick which makes me worry I won't make it since he has a lot more discipline than me.

I did some research and decided on gum and an e-cigarette. I've used a few different brands of patches in the past on long haul flights, but found I'm allergic to the adhesive. After 10 minutes I have a red square welt on my skin that burns and itches for days after. I figured the gum would work to keep my mouth busy and I can control how much nicotine I get and the e-cigarette will fulfil the mechanical action of smoking, plus I live in Aus so no nicotine filters are all I can get unless I make the effort to find nicotine filters online and order them from overseas. Good thing I'm way too lazy and impatient for that.

I'm also going to paint my nails white so when I do have a cigarette, I can see it yellowing the nail polish more clearly than when my nails aren't painted. I also figure quitting will encourage me to drink more water. Anything mint makes me want to drink heaps of water so I got mint cartridges and gum.

And yes, the title is a reference to how not smoking is probably going to drive me insane like The Joker =P

EDIT: OK, maybe I won't be using the gum... the lowest strength is too strong and made me feel sick -_-

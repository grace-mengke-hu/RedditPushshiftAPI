Back to day 1

Well after 11 months killing it, here I am back at day 1. They just snuck back in, I fooled myself into thinking I could have the occasional one. As usual this escalated to buying packs again and today I feel absolutely shit, shakey and hungover from smoking last night. 

Day 1, here we go. 
This fine I will beat 11 months.

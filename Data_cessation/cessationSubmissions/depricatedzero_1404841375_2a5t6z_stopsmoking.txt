Day -6

So I'm quitting. Hi!

I quit in 2008 for 4 years using Chantix. The side effects I experienced weren't that bad - the dreams, about 30 seconds of nausea 15 minutes after taking the pill. None of the suicidal thoughts or other issues people have reported.

Unfortunately, I replaced it with eating and my weight spiraled out of control. I made the conscious decision in 2012 to start smoking again to get my weight under control, planning to quit once I was executing a plan of action for that.

Well, the time has come. I was 494lbs in January, I'm down to 434 as of yesterday. I spoke with my doctor and started Chantix again. Yesterday was the first day of taking the pill. I'm giving it one week for the medicine to get into my system and then cutting it off cold turkey, just like before. 

Next Monday will be Day 0, the day I quit. Since I'm consciously retraining my eating habits right now and am cognizant of them, there's no better time to quit.

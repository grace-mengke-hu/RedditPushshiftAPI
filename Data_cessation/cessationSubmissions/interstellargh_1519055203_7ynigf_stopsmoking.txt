Day 10! I'm still sick, but here's a list of benefits quitting my 3 cigs/day :D

overall, i am just really pleased. this is the first 10-day period within my own environment that i've stopped smoking. i've been a 3/day smoker (anywhere from 1-5, so im averaging 3) for like 10 years. hard to admit to myself, i never told myself i was a smoker, never labeled myself. but its hard to deny it. there have been a few times in my life where i didnt smoke, maybe a few months in 2010 when i got a bad cold and kind of let it go. but i think i still managed to sneak a few a week in, then. there was like 4 months when i was vaping only in 2015. but i was not committed to quitting nicotine, i didn't put in the effort or have any tools. 

all my life i've been a secret smoker. secret from even myself. after a bad breakup in may last year, i just went extreme with it. instead of being secret, i was public. didn't care anymore. but as i healed from the breakup, i became more honest with myself about a lot of things. including smoking. and when i pictured my life how i wanted it to be, when i gave myself CHOICE AND AGENCY to live a better life, i knew smoking wasn't part of my ideal future. the breakup was the best thing that happened to me because i wanted to reinvent myself.

i quit like 5-15 days a few times over the past year, but i was traveling each time, so as soon as i got back, i was smoking again. i've never been THIS committed to stopping. allen carr's book has been helpful, i just want to listen to the audiobook on repeat. i have no idea why its like brainwashed me, but i'm so happy it has!

the ONLY negative: last week i ended up non-stop sneezing, turned into a slight cough and lots of blowing my nose. feels like allergies but no allergy pills will help :( but i almost am wearing this sickness as a badge of honor! i'm proud of it because i know it means i'm healing, slowly. 

here's what i noticed in last 10 days has become easier/more fun/bettered my life without cigs

* i love not stinking of cigarettes. i feel like my own mouth is a happier place and i want to brush and floss more than ever to take care of it. i have no fears kissing the guy i'm seeing. 

* taste and smell does feel more intense. not a lot, because i'm stuffy still haha, but i do feel like my taste and smell is changing oddly. bad side effect: the other day i forgot deodorant and i was hyperaware ALL DAY LONG of my own smell, haha

* my levels of self care have increased tenfold. i want to look better and take care of myself more. i think its because i'm not constantly going through nicotine withdrawal in between cigarettes, but i just generally have a little bit more time/energy for ME. last night i was laying in bed with wet hair and i was like, i'm going to give myself a blowout. i havent done that in YEARS. so i sectioned my hair and really put in the work to make it nice-- just because why not. and when i do this, it lasts for like 2-4 days and holds a really nice style. so worth it! 

* i do things after work. i'm not rushing home for a cigarette, so why rush home at all? i used to rush home for a cigarette, maybe two. then i'd go inside and mope around not knowing what to do with myself before my next cigartte. yesterday, after a 5 hour roadtrip normally i'd rush home for a cig-- or i'd give in and smoke in my car/at a rest stop. last night, i ran an errand when i got back to town. last week, i went to yoga right after work. i ran 2x last week! 

* related to self-care/doing things after work: i'M SO MUCH MORE PRODUCTIVE. i guess my energy levels are increasing, slightly. i still feel sick and a little lethargic, but i'm surprising myself by actually doign productive things. i had a half day friday and normally i'd have 2 cigs in the morning on a day off. instead, i managed to clean my fridge, tidy my room, do my taxes, and go for a trail run. wtf? who am i???? i seriously surprised myself with my productivity. i feel like a superhero. 

* less anxiety and less rushed, just generally clarity of mind. i am finding it SO easier to calm my anxieties. physically when i find myself stressed (fists balling, racing thoughts, moving quickly) i'm able to slow down and be like "what am i rushing off to? everything is fine, i'm not in a hurry at all." i used to smoke bc my anxiety wanted it. i'd literally light up, sit, and stew mostly in my own relationship garbage. i'd try to predict the future and mind-read my partner-of-the-moment. i'd focus on all the negativity in my life. now, when i feel anxious thoughts come up, its so much easier to let them go. i can focus on the abundance in my life instead. instead of being like "the guy i'm dating didn't do x,y,z, this is going nowhere, why am i with him" my mind is literally changing how it operates. an anxious thought might come across like "what if he cheats on me?" (a huge fear of mine due to past relatinoship) and i'm able to rationally say to myself, "there's zero evidence of this, he told you he's only seeing you, and you talked to him only a few hours ago. you'll see him soon. he's affectionate and cares about you. it might reach a turning point someday, but you can't predict that now so just enjoy the moments you have together and have fun with him because so far he's only a positive addition to your life."

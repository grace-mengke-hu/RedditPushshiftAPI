I don't want to die gasping for my last breath...

Been smoking for 8 years now and I really feel its time to quit. I want to be more active and I know smoking is not helping. I have an extremely addictive personality which makes the idea of quitting even hard to think about. I need support and after reading posts on this subreddit I feel you guys are the most upbeat and supportive people I've ever seen. Please help me.

4 days, 20 hours, 42 minutes, really really tempted right now

It's been pretty easy so far, aside from lack of sleep, occasional snapping, jumpiness and a headache, but nothing severe.
I used nicotine gum the first two days to help me to start to break the habit of actually smoking the cigarette, since then I haven't chewed more, since I dont want to replace one habit with another.

But in the past 6 hours or so the ideas have been popping into to my head:

* "why are you even quitting? You know that you'll just start again"
* "You enjoy smoking, why quit?"
* "what are you going to when you'll have drink? not smoke?"
* "almost nobody knows that you're quitting, it wont be *emberrassing at all if you have just one cigarette"
* "forever without a cigarette, is a really, really long time..."

So, when will this go away, and do you have any coping mechanisms for in the meantime.

The cravings are back?

After the first week I was feeling better, my cravings were few and far between and not intense. I thought I had made it through the tough part. Oh how I was wrong. the last 3 days have been hell all over again , I have dreams about smoking I wake up dying for a smoke, I cant stop thinking about smoking... I just don't get it. Is this just a normal part of addiction?  At this point I don't feel like I am going to cave to the temptation it just sucks.

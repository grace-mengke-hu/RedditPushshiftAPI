Christmas and smoking.

So this is my 1st Christmas since quitting.

I'm at my parent's as usual. It's loud and can be stressful. Going out for a smoke was my escape. In the lead up to this trip I was worried.

However, I'm currently sat on my best mate's sofa while he smokes away and I'm not bothered. If I can do that then I'm sure I can survive having my niece, nephews and anyone else being loud (and possibly annoying) over the next few days without nipping out for a ciggie.

I hope those of you who find not smoking at this time of year difficult will be OK. Do what you need to do to not spark up and come in here for a top up of inspiration.

Had a cigarette after three days of cold turkey. Does this mean I'm back to square one?

Really hating myself for caving. I could've done literally anything for a couple minutes to take my mind off it, but no! 



Will the withdrawal be as bad this time around, as it was the first time? Do I erase my original quite date?

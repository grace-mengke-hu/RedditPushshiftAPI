I lost track of the number of days over the weekend...

I woke up Sunday thinking I had been quit for 25 days. Nope - 26! I freaking lost track before a month even passed! I feel like this is a huge mental hurdle!

I remember my quit date and have an app tracking how many days I've been smoke free, but like most of you I also remember off the top of my head how many days it's been. In fact, the first two weeks that number was the first thing to pop into my head the second my alarm rang... "Okay, Day 5..." "Okay, Day 6..." and so on.

Felt really good to have smoking pushed so far to the back of my mind that I lost track for a minute!

4+ months..

So, I have stayed smoke-free for more than 4 months.. Tbh, at this point the good days are more than the bad ones, as in - there has definitely been an improvement in both my mental and physical well-being since I quit, BUT I still have really bad days and a myriad of weird symptoms :(( And I don't wanna just moan and whine, I am looking for some advice on how to combat that..
I started eating right and exercising (been doing yoga almost every day), I did some tests (full physical,chest X-ray and stomach ultrasound) and it all came back clear.
Latest installment in the quit smoking fun ride has been mad sinus congestion and headaches :/ Guess, I also had underlying hay fever on top of everything else, so now that I quit my sinuses are messing with me :((

Any tips and advice are very much appreciated :) 
/end rant ;)

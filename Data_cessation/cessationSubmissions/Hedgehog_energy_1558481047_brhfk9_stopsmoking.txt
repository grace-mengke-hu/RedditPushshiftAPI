Stop me before I start

I don’t know if this belongs on this sub, but I need some help. I bought a pack of Marlboros to try and for whatever reason I just really want to smoke them. However, I know I don’t want to go down this path, as I have an addictive personality and bad self control. If anyone could just try and give me some reasons not to, or personal stories to help me stop before it begins I’d really appreciate it.

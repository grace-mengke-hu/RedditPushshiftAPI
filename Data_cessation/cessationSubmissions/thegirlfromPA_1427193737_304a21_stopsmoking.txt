21 days!

No slips, no restarts, no oops I had one and drowning the pack. First time I have ever made it this far without a single cigarette. The last couple days have been HARD though and I'm not sure why. Sometimes the fight seems huge and the idea that I will struggle with this forever is there. I know rationally that it will not always feel like such a fight... and I keep on keeping on.

Super Cravings

I still can't seem to get over the emotional moments without a cigarette. I am glad I am able to identify that the only reason why I want to smoke it to handle these emotions though. The thought of asking a co-worker for a cigarette is soo tempting today Im afraid I will give in. Would it be cheating if I stood next to someone who smoked?

I'm at work and can't really exercise or act out so I have to internalize these emotions and usually I would just go out for a smoke or 5 throughout the day. Trying to hold strong hoping that I won't have to reset my badge. 

Please send your positive vibes this way.

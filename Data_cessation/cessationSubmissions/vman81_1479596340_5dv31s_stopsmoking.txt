5 years

And honestly I think it's because of you guys.
I haven't felt a honest craving in years beyond what can only be described as a nostalgic twinge, and I still check i this subreddit every few months and feel good about it. I've been running for the last 5 years (literally) and my life has changed so much for the better I can't even begin to describe it.

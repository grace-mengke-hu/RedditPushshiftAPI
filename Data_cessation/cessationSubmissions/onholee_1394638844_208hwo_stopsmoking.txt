Been smoking about 20 to 30 a day for around 19 years. I am only 34 (started young ;) ) I just quit!

Time to take control of my life and stop being a non forward thinking person. The damage I have done to myself and silly money spent just so I can puff down some smoke into my lungs. Sick of coughing, wheezing, chest pains, terrible hayfever I never used to have as a kid. Sick of bad skin, stinking of smoke, occasionally not getting boners. I used to do so much sport and now I am heaving breathing after walking up some stairs. I gotta be serious about this.

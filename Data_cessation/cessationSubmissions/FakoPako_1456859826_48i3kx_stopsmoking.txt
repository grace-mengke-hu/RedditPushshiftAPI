How awesome is this huh?

Seriously, how awesome is it not to smoke? Can you guys believe we don't smoke anymore? Someone asks you for a light..."I don't smoke.. sorry". If feels so good to say it! After short 60 days, I feel amazing. I can't even explain. Virtually every aspect of my life improved. There are so many things to love about not smoking, I don't know which one to pick as best. 

I can not wait until summer time, when all my hard work at the gym pays off and I look good...and not smoking. I don't have to leave my gf anymore when we are out.. just to go smoke outside. I don't stink anymore. She loves it. All that money I saved too...over 300 bucks right now. I mean, what else could you ask for?

Today while brushing my teeth, I realized how healthy and clean my mouth feels. It just feel so fresh. My teeth are smooth. I don't have that smoker's stink lingering anymore. 

This is amazing and all of you non smokers are amazing too! If you can accomplish this, there is nothing you can't accomplish then.

Now, go for a run! go to the gym! Eat something healthy! Drink tons of water! Time to reverse all these years of smoking...time to be an adult and take care of yourself! 

DAMN RIGHT!

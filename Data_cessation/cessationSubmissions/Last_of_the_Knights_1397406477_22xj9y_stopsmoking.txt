Fell off the wagon

So I smoked for 3 years. The last 6 months of that I smoked about a pack per day. Finally had enough, got the patches, which were absolutely miserable. But they got me through the physical withdrawal symptoms. Went about 3 months without touching anything, proudly.  Then last night I went to a bar with a buddy - he was meeting a girl, said she was bringing a friend. I haven't really had a girl in my life in...a long time (my job doesn't...help), and I was pretty excited. Her friend was...rude, and I got pissed, because I've had shit luck with women for most of my life. It's like a switch flipped and I reverted to my old asshole behavior in an instant - got completely wasted, next thing I knew I was 8 cigarettes into a pack. I left the rest of them there, pretty disgusted with myself.
Woke up this morning with that familiar shit-taste in my mouth.
I'm not needing a cig right now like I did when I was chain smoking, but I'm disappointed that I never managed to shake the emotional addiction. I'm thinking that my smoking habit was just an expression of a certain level of self-loathing...

Not going to beat up on myself though. Just going to brush my teeth, reset the badge, and start over.

TL;DR
Figured out why I smoked in the first place. No solution to THAT reason, but....eliminated another trigger.

Relapse... I need support.

I went from about 30 a day to none. I stayed quit for 15 days and then relapsed. I am smoking between 2 and 4 cigarettes a day now. I relapsed a week ago and I feel really disappointed. I mean coming from 30 a day, 2 feel like an accomplishment. I wish I could just quit and erase the cravings from my mind. I know I have to keep strong and stick to my decision, but it's easier said than done. 

How do you guys deal with relapses?

Any way to counter the brain fog? 

To begin, ignore the badge, as it isn't accurate - I'm still smoking. I've been struggling of late...I'll quit for 2-3 days, and go right back to smoking.  I'm stopping soon, as I'm just sick of it. 
  
On day 2-3, I get the infamous brain fog that sets in.  Right now, this will be a major problem, as I'm starting a new job on Wednesday.  I was hired to do Tech support for an ISP/Cable provider.  The first month is just training thankfully, however, the brain fog I get makes it really hard to focus and retain anything, and my communication skills just drop right off the map.  

I will be quitting within the next few days, and if need be, I'll explain to the trainer that I'm quitting.  But, I want to know if any of you have any tips on beating the brain fog?  It would be really helpful, as I don't want to appear to be the feigning addict I am, and have it interfere with my training right off the bat.

Thanks!

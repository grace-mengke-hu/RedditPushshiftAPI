Over two weeks and SO much easier!

Hi guys! Hope you're all doing well :)

I was going to update yesterday on my two week mark but I was at the hospital all day (I'm fine!) just to get some tests done; I got paranoid at how long I've had a cough that has been bashing on my ribs. The tl;dr is that I got bronchitis around Christmas, quit smoking two Sundays ago and the cough from illness and quitting has resulted in reeeeeally bad rib pain. I got a chest x-ray and EKG. Every nurse and doctor and PA I spoke to were so supportive of my quit, it was really great and made me so proud. Doc says my lungs look *fantastically* clear and all I need is ibuprofen and an inhaler to give my ribs a break. 

The only craving I had all day yesterday was on the way to the hospital. My GPS got me lost twice (taking me to two non-ER medical buildings) and what should have been a ten minute ride took 30. I was hurting, frustrated and hungry (I hadn't eaten in case they needed blood work) and every gas station I passed brought another angry cry from my addict to stop and buy a pack. 

But I didn't. I knew it was my asshole addict trying to take advantage of a shitty situation and I was not having it. My addict is such a bitch. But I don't have to listen to a goddamn word she says anymore, because I don't need to hurt myself. 

Thanks to everyone on this sub for all the support! I wasn't sure I could really make it two weeks with no nicotine but that was just my addict bullshitting me. To everyone who's just starting out, it gets so much easier! Honest, it does. Just take it one craving at a time :)

Let's not smoke today!

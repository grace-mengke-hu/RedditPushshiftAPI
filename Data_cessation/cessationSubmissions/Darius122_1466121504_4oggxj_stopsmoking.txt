Gooshhh i HATE thosee dreams.. Yesterday night I had a smoking dream where i had ONLY one puff and throrwn cig away.. I Felt so miserable and destroyed/ashamed of my failure and all that effort putted in to stop smoking just deceaved in 1 puff . Was glad to wake up and realise it was only a dream. ( i was drunk tho ) Can anyone explain to me what's going on our mind/brain system .

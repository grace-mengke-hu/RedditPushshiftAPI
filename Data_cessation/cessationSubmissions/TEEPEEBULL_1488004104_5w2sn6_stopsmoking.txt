Here I sit, Brokenhearted.....

Thinking back to how it started..

A Teenage kid, so insecure...

Thought fitting in, would be the cure...

He took a smoke and made the choice...

To silence his smart inner voice......

There was girls and there was booze..

And so his inner demon choosed....

To take the risk of self destruction by ignoring all the best instruction...

He was young and indestructable...
so he waste's no time on things instructable...

Turn the clock through many years..

Many smokes, and many tears...

Friend and family gone before...

Learned lessons strike to the core.!

I wish , I wish, I wish I swore!!!!
These fucking smokes would be - NO MORE!!!

I wished and tried a hundred times- with best intentions on my mind..

But true success I could not find... 

was I just stupid or just so blind?

A few attempts and I was discouraged..

Then- I saw Allan Carr- and I was encouraged!!!!

So, being the same, a smoker as me, check out this flick and SET YOURSELF FREE!!!!

Been smoking since I was 18. Now, 11 years later I've finally found something that works

Been about a 6-7 ciggs a day smoker for the last 11 years and I never thought I'd be able to quit. The patch made me nauseous and dint work. The gum satisfied about 50% of the cravings only when I was chewing it so I was either always chewing a piece, or my jaw was too tired to talk from all the chewing, that had to go. Even the Blu e-cigg didn't really do the job for me. It just  gave me blue balls and made me want a cigarette even more.

But I finally found something that works. A vape. After spending so much time watching people smoke them and laughing at how extreme people who vape we're trying to be, I bought a smok pen plus with a 6mg nicotine bottle for about $80 and I haven't looked back since. I'm currently on my 4th week and down to a 3 mg bottle and I haven't thought twice about a cigarette whenever I see someone walking by with one. 

If anyone is one the fence about buying one due to the price, I highly recommend it. It's worth every penny and more

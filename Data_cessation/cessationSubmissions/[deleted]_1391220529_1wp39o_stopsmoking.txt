I just finished my last cigarette. Hopefully forever.

I am taking the entire month of february as a dry month. No cigarettes, no drinking, no smoking, no drugs of any type. Complete sobriety, which I have lived without for almost two years now. At the end of this month we'll see where I am and how I've done. I will probably continue smoking weed and drinking at the end of the month, but I think I'm done with cigarettes forever. Wish me luck.

Round 2: 12 hours no smoke!

I quit in the past, for a month. But at the time, I was only smoking 4-6 cigarettes a day. After I went back to smoking, my habit picked up to 6-10 cigarettes a day (sometimes more, but definitely not a pack). I also switched brands from the *organic* stuff (Spirits) I used to smoke to Reds, which can only be a step down, health wise.

Anyway, I'm quitting again! I had my last cigarette exactly 13 hours and 20 minutes ago! Let's do it..

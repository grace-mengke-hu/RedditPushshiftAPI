is this as good as it gets?

over six months now, and i am appreciative of how 'free' i am of nicotine in a basic sense. it's not my first thought waking up or going to sleep, and i like feeling clean and healthy, and feeling like i've accomplished something don't get me wrong. 

it's just, god damn, does this mean i can never smoke a cigarette again? this thought makes me sad because lately i've been missing the crux of a cigarette so much. i feel miserable because i feel like i couldn't date a smoker but the guy i've been dating on/off is a smoker and the smell is both off-putting and wildly infuriating because it makes me want one. 

and is this the best i'm ever going to feel? healthy?? because every time i think of smoking, i have to convince myself not to bum a smoke off someone or go to the shop and end this

Getting Annoyed by Vapers... (RANT)

I quit cold turkey 230 days ago. Its been a long journey. Lots of hard work and difficult moments trying to stay strong. Recently a few friends have transitioned to using vaporizers. They now tend to talk to me about it and essentially put us on the same platform of quitters. 

Frankly, someone who merely moved to using a vaporizer isn't the same as completely ditching nicotine and the act of smoking/vaping. I tend to roll my eyes when it gets brought up. They're perfectly fine two weeks into their transition, where I was a raving maniac at two weeks. I don't want praise for quitting, I don't care if it gets acknowledged or not. But when I see my vaping friends relish in "quitting" and start talking about it, it kind of pisses me off. I know, its catty and lame on my end to let it get to me. But we've gone down different roads and I don't think we wear the same badge. Essentially, if they want to talk about quitting, I don't care, but I don't want to be lumped in with them. 

Anyone else in a similar boat? Anyone else totally disagree? Just needed to vent and I don't really have people to relate with about this. 

EDIT: Wellllllll.... this didn't turn out quite how I was hoping. Naive to think otherwise. Carry on.

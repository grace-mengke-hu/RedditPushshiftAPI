Day Four

I made it through the first three days!!! To be honest, it wasn't that bad at all. I rolled my own cigarettes, and I think that because there are a lot fewer additives in the tobacco it is much easier to quit. So if you're thinking about quitting but aren't quite ready, I would suggest switching to hand rolled cigarettes for a little while. Another friend of mine quit hand rolled cigarettes a few years ago and told me he was fine after day one. Obviously any kind of cigarette will contribute to your addiction, but I guess it's something to consider.
This is my third time quitting, and the first two times I made it nine months before giving in while drinking. No more! I remember now how gross smoking was when I gave in. Any way, sorry for rambling. Just wanted to update to give others hope.

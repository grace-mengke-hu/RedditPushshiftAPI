So close to a year!

I have no quit smoking for the same period as human gestation! Woohoo! I have like a not-smoking-now baby. Except I am not pregnant and will continue making not-smoking-now babies. Wow. That could not be more confusing.

Anyway, I'm only a couple months away from a year now! It seems pretty gross to me, the whole smoking thing. I occasionally think, "Yeah, a cigarette would be good right now," when I'm really stressed out but it's not very hard to talk myself out of it. It's pretty fleeting. If that's the worst I have to look forward to, I feel good about that!

My advice to those starting out - just don't smoke. I would be well past a year if I hadn't relapsed nine months ago. Just don't smoke. Do whatever you have to do (other than meth or something) to not smoke a cigarette. Go for a walk. Count to ten. Count to ten again. Eat a piece of chocolate. Go outside and look at nature or the sidewalk. Go inside and look at your cat or cook some bacon. Just do whatever you need to do to not give in to your craving.

Good luck! You got this!

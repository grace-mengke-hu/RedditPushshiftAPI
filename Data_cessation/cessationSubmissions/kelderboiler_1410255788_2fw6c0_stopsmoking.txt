I have a panic disorder and quitting smoking feels totally unfeasible to me. Any help on dealing with withdrawal?

I have PTSD (non-combat related) and am in therapy for it, which is helping a *lot*. I've been feeling a lot better and panic attacks and flashbacks have greatly diminished. However, whenever I attempt to give up smoking, I get very nervous and irritable from withdrawal and this tends to trigger attacks. 

I do really want to quit, I am motivated. I am just looking for some techniques to cope with the emotional effects of withdrawal. I was thinking exercise would probably help, so I'll pick up running again. 

What are some other things that have helped you cope with irritability and anxiety from quitting?

Thanks in advance!

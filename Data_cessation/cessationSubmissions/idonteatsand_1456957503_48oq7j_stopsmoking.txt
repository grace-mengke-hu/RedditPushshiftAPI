Thoughts on Allen Carr's Easy Way and the worst part of quitting.

I listened to Easy Way recently and I have not smoked for 5 days.  For anyone interested here is the link for the audio version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoig-BJ81kw

I have quit a few times before, but this time feels different.  I can really get behind the idea that quitting is easy because I am not making a sacrifice.  I am doing something that is good for me, saving money, and improving my life.  The physical cravings are down and I can drink and be around smokers without breaking so things are good.  Highly recommended and think it is worth a listen to.

But the worst part of quitting is that I can now smell things better.  That may sound odd, but I have smelt many people who smell AWFUL and is something I did not notice before.  It is great that I feel great, am saving money, and can breathe better.  But being able to smell better has a very negative side.  lol

I just won't buy them anymore.

I'm 25 and smoked my first cigarette in February of this year. Since then I went from smoking 1 or 2 cigarettes every few days to 1 or 2 packs a week. 

I finished my last pack yesterday &amp; now I'm just going to not buy them anymore. It seems like the most logical approach but I can definitely feel the urge to just hop in the car and grab a pack. 

I feel a bit on edge &amp; I don't want to be a bitch to my family just because I'm craving a smoke. Any tips?

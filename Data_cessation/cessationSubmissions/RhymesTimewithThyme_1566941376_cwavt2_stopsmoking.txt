So far... kinda good!

I switched from cigarettes to vaping a week ago. I ran out of vape at 3 PM yesterday, then today I basically sucked every capsule I had left dry till it hurt my throat because I’m a disgusting monster, but... it’s gone! Now all I have to do is go to work tonight and not buy another one when I get off. I’m a couple weeks sober from alcohol and marijuana so my life is already improving manifold. I’m lifting weights again and being super productive with my chores and hygiene. I got classic WoW yesterday and have been playing for 6 hours straight so that is helping me keep my mind off things, “switching addictions” if you will. Although I don’t really have any penchant for video game addiction so I’m just using it as a filler for now. I’ll check back in in a few days when I have more positive news like being 100% nicotine free.

Insomnia...

I'm onto day five of being cigarette-free, which is the longest I've ever gone. After reading Allan Carr's The Easy Way to Stop Smoking, I have no desire to pick up the habit again, except for the fact that for the past two nights I've had horrible insomnia.  I'll be exhausted around 10 pm (around the time when I usually fall asleep), but around midnight I'll realize that I've been laying with my eyes closed for hours.  It doesn't feel like it's been that long.  Around 1:30 am I get so frustrated that I get up and go out to the living room for a little bit.  I finally fall asleep at 3:30, only to wake up 3 hours later for work.

Anyone else deal with this specific withdrawal symptom?  If so, what helped? I'm desperate for a full night of sleep.

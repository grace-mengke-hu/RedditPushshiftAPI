Day 10 complete

I am smoke free for 10 days. It's only five days away from being smoke free the longest in my life. I once didn't smoke for 15 days, but due to a dumb night of drinks with my friends, I was sucked back in. Anyway, it's not going to happen again. I am a non-smoker and will be a non-smoker for the rest of my life. Coming to health, my chest is a little tight since morning. Not sure if its related to smoking, or because of my high triglycerides (cholesterol). It's kinda worrying. Hopefully its nothing. Anyway, now that I got a hang of it, I will post my progress once every 2 days from now on. Thanks for reading.

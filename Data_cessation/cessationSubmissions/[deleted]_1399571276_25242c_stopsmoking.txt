Hey there Quitters.  I've been a smoker for a long, long time now.  Tried a few different methods for quitting, and have had mild success with vapor and e-cigs.  My only problem with the e-cigs is that it doesn't get rid of the cigarette addiction- it just replaces it with another and as soon as I have a problem with the e-cig, I get another damn cigarette. 

I suppose I'm just looking for some affirmation, some advice and wondering what to do with my goddamn hands all day now.

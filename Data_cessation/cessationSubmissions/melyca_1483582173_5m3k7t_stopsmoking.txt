I survived day 2!

After 18 years, I'm done! I quit!! It's day 2 and I'm doing alright. I am using the patch but I'm thinking of trying to go half a day with tomorrow then none at all the next day if half a day goes ok. 

The hardest times are with my morning coffee, after meals and when I'm bored...but I'm not giving up!! Any advice for the patch?

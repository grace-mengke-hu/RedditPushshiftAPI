Broke up with gf, need support.

Hey guys, I just broke up with my gf and I feel like shit. I stopped smoking two weeks ago just for her and have reached a point where my friends smoke in front of me and I don't get a craving, and now that I'm overwhelmed by those feelings the need to smoke again is rising. I need your support, I can't see how much more I can hold back.

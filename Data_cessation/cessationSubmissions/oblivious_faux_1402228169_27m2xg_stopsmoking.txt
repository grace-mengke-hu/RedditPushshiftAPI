i need to stop

I am 14

okay, so a lot of shit has been happening these weeks. and I'm very depressed. i started smoking at the start of January, but because of my age, I'm unable to actually but packs of them. so me and my friends usually just steal a lot from their parents. and it really does help when i smoke. i probably sound like a little kid but whatever. now to the reason i need to stop. my girlfriend knows that i smoke, and isn't really happy of the idea. and i want to make her happy and not look at me bad when i pull out my lighter and a cig. i told her i stopped, but i keep smoking. it's just all the depress ment is telling me to smoke. and i kinda want to stop but i cant. is there anyway anyone can help? thank you.

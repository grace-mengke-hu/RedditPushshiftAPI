11th or 2nd, Depending on how I look at it. I wasn't ready to quit, but didn't want to smoke anymore.

My last cigarette was on 2/11/13 when I went down to the e-cigarette store. The e-cig definitely helped with the immediate withdrawl, but the nicotine content of the liquid was too strong at first, then it was headaches and cotton mouth from the propylene glycol so I switched to vegetable glycerin and the damn thing started flooding all the time. Too much damn work and trouble to get used to this new method so I just said screw it and am now on my 2nd day with nothing... Wish me luck!

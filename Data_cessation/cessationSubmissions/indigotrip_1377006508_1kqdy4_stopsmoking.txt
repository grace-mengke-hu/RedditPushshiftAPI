What shoud I do?

I started to quit smoking using an electronic cigarette, I then started to read the book, then stopped the e cigarette and went back to the book and now I have finished. I feel as though I messed up and should have smoked through the book so I learnt to hate it. I just have a good memory of my last fag. I feel as though I have the mindset of someone who has quite using the Willpower method. I so badly want to enjoy quitting but I feel like I miss cigarettes. I don't want to feel this way but I also don't want to smoke again. I'm unsure as to whether this is just part of the three week withdrawl or whether I should try quitting again but smoke through rereading the book. But maybe that's just counter productive. I'm confused and need some advice! What should I do? I don't want to smoke but I also don't want to stress over not smoking for the rest of my life. I just wish I had smoked through the book. What would you guys do? Has anyone successfully quit by quitting their own way but also reading the book?

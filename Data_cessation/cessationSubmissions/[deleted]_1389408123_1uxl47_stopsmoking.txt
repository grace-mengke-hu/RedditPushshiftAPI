Time for round 3. Fuck smoking. Fuck nicotine and fuck what it does to me.

The only reason I picked up smoking again those other 2 times was because of the coughing.

First time i tried quitting, i went 5 days without a smoke. The cravings weren't what drew me to lighting up those filthy disgusting sticks. It was the coughing.

Second time i tried I went almost 2 weeks, coughing started to ease up after the first week but I was still coughing a lot in the second week.

I wasn't even coughing anything up half the time. I lit up again because the coughing so bad I had headaches constantly, I had a sore chest and a sore throat. I couldn't concentrate either. It wasn't because of the cravings, it was because I was coughing so much I couldn't remain focused and I had exams to study for.

I kept telling myself I'd quit, but today or tomorrow or next week was not the day. Even now I don't want to quit, but at the same time I want to quit.

I'm fucking sick of smoking. I don't want cancer. I don't want health complications. I don't want them anymore. I don't need them. Fuck you nicotine. Fuck smoking.

I'm going to give it my all this time. I'm on a break from university, I have nothing going on right now. I'll take the coughing if it means I won't die from cancer.

Quick question, 6 Days in Cold Turkey.

So before smoking I had anxiety, pretty Bart if I say so myself. Got on Lexapro and all was good. So I picked up smoking, the first year and a half were very spotty and I don't smoke maybe every few days and when drinking. It became a pack every couple a days kinda thing. So fast forward and it's been 8 months of me smoking every single day. 

6 days ago I just quit cold turkey, I just didn't want to smoke anymore and I'm doing great. I'm 100% confident that this is it :) my discipline this time is amazing. So anyways, sleeping is crazy for me.  Every 2-3 hours I wake up in a crazy panic. Cold sweats, anxiety all that jazz. 

My question is, is it because of withdrawals? Is this going to go away? My life without cigarettes is perfect on y medication. I just wasn't on this medication when I first started smoking and never stopped until now while on it. 

Thank you!

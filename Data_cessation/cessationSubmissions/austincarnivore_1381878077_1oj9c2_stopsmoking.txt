Trying to get some useful information

I usually smoke about 7 cigarettes a day.  Some days I will only have 1 or 2.  I picked up a disposable e-cig and I had a few questions.

#1  Roughly how many puffs equal the same amount of nicotine as 1 cigarette? 

#2  Why do I still want a cigarette after a few puffs of the e-cig?

#3  Should I request a badge even though I am still e-smoking?

#4  Any tips for the e-cigs? (I don't think Allen Carr would approve.)

Cravings on day 6 cold turkey?

I've quit cold turkey and the first 2 days were hard. However day 3, 4 and 5 was all smooth, barely had any cravings and didn't bother me at all. However its day 6 now and I woke up with cravings and still craving a cigarette now. I just have that constant obnoxious anxious chest tightness I had on the first day. Anyone else who quit cold turkey go through this? around 6 days/a week into it?

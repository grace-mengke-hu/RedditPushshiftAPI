Day 3. I did things! No one got hurt! Awesome!

My family may make it through this yet unscathed! This was my biggest worry that I would ruin my relationships and scar my children during withdrawal. I have made it to day 3 and I am reporting to you that I have not cussed out any of the children nor harmed the SO in any permanent way. (at least in the last 3 days.)  My fear was so big that I put off quitting for months! The realization that I can actually control my mouth even while going through mentally crippling withdrawals is a wonder to me. Cold Turkey. I think of cigarettes still about once every few minutes. Yesterday I swear I was thinking about them every 4th thought. I am not sure that there was actual time between. It was pretty much constant. I feel really happy that I am thinking about smoking only every few minutes. I have actually informed people that I quit. I didn't tell anyone before because I did not want to disappoint. I feel pretty good about this quit. It sucks, but there is groove to the suckiness. I have tunnel vision with the goal.  I feel like I am sort of going through an awakening. Do I sound nuts? Anyway, I went out into the real world today to do work for the first time. It was super stressful and touch and go for a few minutes. I seriously debated on going all bat shit on a lady who was the mother of government bureaucracy and therefore the gate keeper of all I needed.  Instead I asked the pokerfaced sentinel to please help me find a way to achieve my task. She showed me grudgingly, and I did not verbally strip her of all dignity and make her soul whither with my very ready insults. I am proud of me.I do not smell bad.  I am happy about that. Day 3 doesn't completely suck.

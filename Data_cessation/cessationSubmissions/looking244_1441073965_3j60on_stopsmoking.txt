Only day 3 but insomnia?

I was a 20 a day smoker for 16 years. I don't have any sleep problems usually.. infact I have a heart condition and the medication I take at night  (clonidine) has a slight sedative to it so for years I've been pretty lucky with sleep! 
Now it's 20 past 3 and I've been up for hours and even before that I was waking up like every hour. The thing I don't get is that it's not like I'm really craving cigarettes, if I was I'd maybe get it but right now I'm totally fine! hat gives?

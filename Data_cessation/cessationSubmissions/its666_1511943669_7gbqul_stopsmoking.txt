I'm really Fucking scared now

I've been smoking for 2 years now i'm 19 y/o and lately i had the flu but when i deep inhale i get this weird grumble wheezing noise on the right side of my adombinal near the ribs and when i deep ihale the breath coming out whistles. i think i'm fucked and it's all over.

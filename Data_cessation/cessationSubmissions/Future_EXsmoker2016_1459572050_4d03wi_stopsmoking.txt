87.5 hours smoke free, $14.58 saved and 36.5 cigarettes not smoked

It feels great, the cravings come and go like everything in life....if this is what you really want then you would barely feel them...first 24 hours was tough but the best thing for me or anyone to do is to take it one day at a time

Day 4, not going well...

Hi everyone, 
I'm on day 4 and really struggling after an encounter with my mother. I'll try keep it short. Basically, I live next door to my mum so almost daily I would go over there and have a smoke and a coffee with her. Sunday (day 2)  I started feeling a bit anxious so my mum and I went for a walk, we talked etc and all was good. 

Monday I worked in the arvo, wasn't a great day but got through it and now today she came over to show me something. She was only here for a couple minutes until she said "You know, you don't have to ignore me!" I was surprised and mentioned I had just saw her Sunday, so she replied "yeh but u always used to come over and say hi". 

I got angry and she walked off even more angry at me because how I reacted. I was and am upset because I'm here trying to quit smoking and she has to come over to make me feel like crap for not going around to say hi for a day and a half... 

Currently she is still pissed off with me and probably blaming my quitting for the confrontation, not herself. Which is usual for her. I cracked at her and said things like "I can't believe you, give me a break, how rude" which caused her to be mad and walk off.

Should I have handled it differently? I don't even want to see her at all but I know it will make things worse between us. I just feel like she was just thinking of herself, which wasn't nice. I apologise for long post, thanks for listening. :)

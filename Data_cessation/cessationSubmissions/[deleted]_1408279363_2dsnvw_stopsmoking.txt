200 days up. Was a pack a day for 20 odd years.

Freedom. That is what I have acquired since stopping. Freedom to not worry about where I am getting my next pack. Freedom from worrying about the cost. Cough free. Stink free.

I also ran 30km today. Got my first full marathon on in about 60 days. Couldn't have done that when smoking.

Freedom.

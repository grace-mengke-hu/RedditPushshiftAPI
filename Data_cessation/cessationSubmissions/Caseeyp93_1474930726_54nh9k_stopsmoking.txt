58 hours 21 mins SMOKE FREE

Already starting to feel the benefits of quiting !! 

That feeling when you rush up the stairs and and feel like your going to die ... after 2 days my breathing is already getting better 

What I can't wait for .... 
Been able to run round the park and the garden with my 3 y.o little girl with out having to tell her mummy is tired . Mummy needs a min . I can't play this any more 

My boyfriend is a non smoker and didn't even like to kiss me after I had been smoking . 2 days in all the kisses I want . It's awesome 

I am so glad I have made the choice to stop smoking after 9 years ! Bring on the rest of my smoke free life !!

It's been 4 weeks

It's been 4 weeks since I bought my first e cig.  I smoked Newport Lights since 1991 up until 4 weeks ago.  I know there's controversy around using e cigs to stop smoking, but I am super happy that I haven't put smoke in my lungs and that I can breathe better, and I feel so much better overall, and I can still fake my habit until I don't want to anymore. Most of all, for me, it's been pretty easy.  

Over the years, I tried gum and patches and nic mints and Wellbutrin and none of it worked in the long run for me.  Finally I have hope for staying off the cancer sticks. I love to smoke and e cigarettes changed me. Never thought it would really happen to me, and I hope it sticks.

Best of luck to all of you others out there in finding your way off the butts.  The way to get off of them will be different  for all of us but I hope we all find a way that lasts.

That is all.

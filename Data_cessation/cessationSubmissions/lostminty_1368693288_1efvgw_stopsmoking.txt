I'm making a google spreadsheet script to help with tracking my cutting down and am looking for suggestions

Currently I've set up a form where I can log when I've had a cigarette, and how many I've had since I last logged a smoke.

This goes to a spreadsheet which then bar graphs the average time between smokes.

I'm looking for any suggestions for additional inputs and outputs (am planning to derive other graphs like the derivative of the average time between smoke to indicate trends etc)

One year

Today is the year anniversary to my start of being a non-smoker. And today is just another day in the life of a non-smoker. I just keep telling myself... today is just another day in the life of a non-smoker. Non-smokers don't use cigarettes for stress. Non-smokers don't celebrate with a cigarette. Non-smokers don't socialize with a cigarette. Cigarettes just aren't part of their lives. That's how I finally feel. The thought of smoking comes by but then keeps going by and doesn't stick around. It is a relief. 

Thank you to everybody here for sharing. When I feel weak I've been able to come here and reply to others which makes me feel strong. Sharing what I've done to fight the cravings reminds me that I can continue to do it. And to those that relapsed, thank you for sharing your struggle. You helped by being a reminder that I can't take it for granted because it's that easy to slip back. Thank you to everyone who talks about all the new things they can do. It reminds me just how far I've come and things I can look forward to. And thank you to the new people who list all the reason they want to quit. You help us all remember and be humble with why we quit in the first place.

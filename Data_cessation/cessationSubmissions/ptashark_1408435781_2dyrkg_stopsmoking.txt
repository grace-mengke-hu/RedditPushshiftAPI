Grrrr. Quit yesterday

Good morning. So this is my second day of not smoking. I didn't scale down, I don't have an e-cig, no nicotine patch or gum, hitting this mofo head on and kicking it cold turkey. I smoked for 8 years, quit for two and have been smoking for two once again, kicking the habit now once and for all seeing as my wife is pregnant with our first child.

I do know that I'm hating everybody and feeling pretty weird today. Head is stuffy, almost feels like I'm getting cold tremors, eyes feel weird and sore which is new. Thinking that I should feel a little better by tomorrow evening or Thursday when most of the nicotine has left my blood. This first few days suck ass, but I need to push through this. Eating a Super C every 5 hours I do not smoke to reward myself. Possibly a way to get addicted to them, but fuckit. If I can get over the physical withdrawal symptoms I'll make it. Pretty glad my boss isn't here this week, I'm a bit of a wreck.

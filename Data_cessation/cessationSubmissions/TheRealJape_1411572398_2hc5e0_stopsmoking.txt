Day 3!

This subreddit is awesome. It's nice to read about the struggles and successes of others and know I'm not alone. 

My attitude has been my worst enemy, but knowing my agitation is stemming from nicotine withdrawal has been instrumental in checking my speech and actions toward others. Withdrawal and cravings are difficult, but are no excuse to treat others poorly. I brought myself down here, and it's unfair to drag others down with me because of my own personal struggles.

I think it's important to continue some routines where you would have previously smoked. This advice isn't for everybody, but if I can survive a craving while hanging with my smoker friends on their smoke breaks at work, I can survive any craving. Some people need to break these routines and I understand. But I liken it to standing up to your bully. It thrills me to know that I can resist the control cigs have on me. 

There may come a time where I stumble, but I don't want to fall back into smoking. I've smoked for 8 years and watched my health, both physical and mental, deteriorate due to smoking. I've had enough of my old self and my old ways. I'm tired of my clothes smelling like smoke even after a washing. 

This is it. Thanks, /r/stopsmoking for being there.

A commitment post

I have been trying to quit smoking since October 8th 2017. I relapsed countless times. My longest streak was about 3 months. 

I was on day 3 of being smokefree today. I got out of office a little early and met a close friend who was a smoker. I rejected the first cigarette offer but the voice in my head told me "c'mon man, it's August 1st tomorrow. You can start tomorrow". After that point I binged 5 cigarettes. Only the first one gave me the "buzz of nicotine" which all of you can relate i guess. I arrived home with a subtle headache and a feeling of guilt. 

There is only one rule. Never take a puff again. It's binary, 1 or 0. I'm done with inhaling hot chemicals into my lungs. 

I was a long time lurker here and all i can see here is a really genuine and supportive community. I wrote this post to reflect on myself and publicly commit myself to never get caught in this infinite loop of nicotine wanting. 

I wish all of you smokefree days. Stay strong.

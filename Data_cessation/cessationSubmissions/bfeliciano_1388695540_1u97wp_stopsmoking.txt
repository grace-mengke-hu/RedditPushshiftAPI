I'm pretty glad I caught whooping cough...

...because I haven't had a cigarette since Sunday at 4 PM! 

It wasn't even my new years resolution to quit I've just not wanted one since I've been so sick. The true test will be when I'm feeling better but I think this time I can do it. :D

*P.S. to the girl who (shall remain nameless) gave me whooping cough, your kisses were worth the cough, and plus you helped me quit smoking. ;)*

Has anyone tried going to a sauna? Does it help?

I remember reading somewhere that going to a sauna three days in a row can help you quit smoking faster, something about sweating out the nicotine or something like that. Has anyone here tried that trick? Did it help you at all? Did anything else help you at all?

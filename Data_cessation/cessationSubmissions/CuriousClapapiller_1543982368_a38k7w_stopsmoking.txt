Boyfriend with ADHD, History of Substance Abuse Trying to Quit Smoking... How Can I help?

The title pretty well says it all. I've been trying to help my boyfriend figure out how to quit smoking, and he is interested in doing so.  The primary reason he struggles with doing so is that he feels anxious when he does not have something to do while waiting for other things. For example, if we are playing games or watching Netflix, he needs to vape or smoke during loading screens or slow parts of the show/game.  He also smokes/vapes when feeling stressed or frustrated about life events as well. ADHD I think is not helping with these urges, but due to history, he is unable to go more common(?) routes of medicine such as ADHD.

I do not have an addictive personality, and when I use substances (alcohol, cigarettes, etc) I am able to use these things here and there without having urges or cravings-- even when I go through spurts of time where I use substances heavily.  It is hard for me to not be able to relate to him, and honestly we are out of options to try. Reddit is my last-ditch hope for some type of advice.

Does anyone have experience quitting given a similar situation? Are there any resources that we can look at that does not involve needing health insurance? What the fuck do I do?

Planning to stop smoking in 2 days, need advice.

So I'm 27, smoking since I was 19. Basically roll my own cigarettes so it's hard to keep track of how much I smoke sometimes but I'd say about 20-30 per day.

I've tried to quit a few time over the last two years, once even bought a vape to try and change the habit but the most I managed was going one week smoke free and about 5 days with one or two cigarettes.

I'm considering nicotine patches, gums or something similar but not sure what would be more useful. Maybe nicotine candies as I always carry mint candies with me anyway.

I'd love to get some advice on how to go trough this without losing my sh** after a week and going back.

So far, I've set the time to stop to a bit leas than 48 hours from now - basically, Friday would be the first day.

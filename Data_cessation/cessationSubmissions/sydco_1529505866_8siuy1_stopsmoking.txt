Day Three, New Routines, WTF

Thanks to this thread, NRTs, Zyban, and the Smoke Free app (ordered hemp oil) I have been able to stay smoke free for 2 days and 9 hours.  I loved (love) smoking, but What THE FUCK!  My mother is on oxygen, been smoking for 47 years, and has COPD.  I visit her every Monday, and used to sit with her at her kitchen table and we'd smoke all night, WTF!  When I did yoga at home I'd take smoke breaks in the middle if it was too hard to "rest", and then reward myself with a smoke after, WTF!  I avoided going to the movies because I couldn't smoke for too long, WTF!  It's a monkey, a monster, so happy everyone is freeing themselves!  Sixteen years later, started at fourteen, second hand smoke for all thirty, hopefully free.

Quit vaping for good.

I quit smoking cigarettes 2 years ago, was a smoker for 8 years, have been vaping since then - usually 4-6 mg nicotine, approximately 15ml a day. 
Stopped vaping cold turkey, currently 1d 13h free from vaping.
I am constantly getting thoughts about what is the point of this, feeling unhappy, nothing gives me satisfaction. 
Any ideas when these thoughts will go away? Any previous experience?

Thanks in Advance!

Anybody else feel like now that they quit smoking they actually get shit done?

What I mean is that when you have a random thought about something you should do, instead of smoking and ruminating over it or feeling a nicotine pang, you just...do it.

Like, I wanted to start fixing my skin, so I just started researching skincare products and ordered them (unfortunately my skin is still shit even after a month without a cigarette)

And I wanted to start listening to more new music and going to shows, so I have been.

I've also been thinking about getting some weights and toning my upper body a little bit, so I'm going to go do that Friday when I go buy cat food.

And it's other little things, like if I have a question about something I'll just Google it, or if I realize I need to get something, I'll immediately go buy it. 

I guess I'm just saying I feel more proactive now than I used to be? There's been a lot of ups and downs with quitting smoking, but this is not one that I had anticipated. Anybody else feel similarly?

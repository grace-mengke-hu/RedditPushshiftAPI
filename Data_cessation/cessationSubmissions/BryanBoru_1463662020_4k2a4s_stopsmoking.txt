Six Month Anniversary Post

Today is it, six months without a cigarette. I haven't had such a timespan without in over 15 years. Although my lungs feel better I fear the damage may be a slim shot to get back to 100%.
The money saved is great, but the stench. I am so glad to not smell like what I smell on smokers now.
This is a typical "If I can do it, anyone can" post. I had a severe love affair with tobacco, at my lowest I would skip meals to have money for smokes. That is all behind me now though. 
Thus sub was paramount to keeping me on my path. Thank you. I honestly feel like I can only say I *used* to be a smoker. I hold no want for them. Keep your heads up and post here whenever you feel weak or at risk. Thanks guys.

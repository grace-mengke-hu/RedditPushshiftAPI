21 Days. This is getting harder...

So I haven't smoked all of September (quit cold turkey after 20 years). 

I cannot, for the life of me, concentrate. It's like I'm wearing a veil made of fog, I wouldn't drive a car in this condition. 
But I have to work. I freelance, so going to the office and pretend is not an option. Anyone have any ideas?

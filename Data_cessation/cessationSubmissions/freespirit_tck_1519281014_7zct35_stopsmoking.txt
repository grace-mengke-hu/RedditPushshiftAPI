Finally working on getting it together

This one is going to be a long one. It's mainly so that I can keep reading this but feel free to read and comment if you wish.

I started smoking over 9 years ago. I kick myself ever since but at that point all I saw was an older lady back in college who used to smoke and we used to hang out. Well one night I was at her place and we were making out and she asked me if I wanted a cigarette. Not wanting to seem like a wuss and blow my chance I took one and ever since, I became a smoker. Mostly so that I could hang out with her and her friends and be one of them.

Although she and her friends pretty much went away from my life after undergrad but the habit stayed. Pretty much smoked 3-4 cigs/day on average since. I reckon I would have smoked over 12,000 cigs by now. Jeez just looking at that figure makes me woozy! 

Anyways, just recently I have tried to quit the habit again. Managed to do it successfully for just under a week but stuff happened, I slipped and relapsed and its been about a week since I've got back to my old ways. I want to quit mainly to get healthier, increase my stamina and largely prove to myself that I can change. Of course, saving money is an added benefit.

I find it especially difficult to quit when I feel nostalgic/excited/cringe etc. Essentially I reckon I look forward to reminiscing moments with a cigarette and I really need to control that to have a grip over my cravings. So basically I am going to try strongly to replace smoking with something else, perhaps eating a protein bar whenever my craving hits.

Its a tough road ahead but I feel like if I keep my eyes on the prize (proving to myself that I can change and not be tempted) it would be worth it.

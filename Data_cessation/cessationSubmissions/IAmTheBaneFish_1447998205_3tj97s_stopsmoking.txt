So this no smoking thing is preeeety good

Boys and girls hey! I've got to say that stopping smoking so far (3 weeks) has been the best decision I've ever made. I feel so productive and feel like I have time for everything. I'm more emotive than usual, am quicker to figure things out. I feel like a kid again - my dog smells like he did when we first got him.. I guess he never stopped. Now that my body doesn't have to process all this garbage and my mind isn't relying on a crutch to keep me going all day I feel absolutely great. It has come with an unexpected but equally good side effect though.. I don't play video games as much. I used to play Counterstrike constantly and the only reason I went so hard was because I had an ash tray and a 25g pouch next to my keyboard. Just wanted to write my ramble down. Thanks!

Aaaarghhhhh..... Day 5 sucks

Almost to the end of day 5. Still utterly miserable from the cravings but also still totally committed to the goal. I’ve been smoking around a pack a day for 20 years. My mother, who was a multi pack a day smoker for most of her life, is currently at home in hospice care dying from lung cancer that turned into small cell brain cancer. My hopes to not put my daughter through the pain that I am currently experiencing has been my motivation to give this shit up. This is honestly the first time I’ve really ever tried to quit for myself and my own reasons. It’s really not fun.... at all. I’ve known a bunch of folks that have quit and stayed quit and I always assumed they were being melodramatic about the difficulties they experienced while quitting. I feel like I probably owe a few of those folks some apologies for undervaluing their struggles. 5 down, countless more to go.

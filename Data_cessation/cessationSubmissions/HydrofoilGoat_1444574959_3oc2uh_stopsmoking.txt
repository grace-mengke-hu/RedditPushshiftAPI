Withdrawal effects - is this a common thing?

I'm currently smoking again, but my most recent attempt was last week, and I want to try again this week. Just wondering if the effects I've experienced are common, because I'd heard about the mood swings, headaches, and exhaustion, but never this.

I'm usually fine for the first day (having done this hundreds of times :/), but it really fucks me up from the second day on. I smoke 12-15 times a day and I've found my longest attempts have been cold turkey, so that's what I do now. I haven't got past day five in a while now so I don't know how long this lasts, but the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th nights are always horrific. I can't sleep, and when I do it's in hour bursts, I wake up in the wee hours of the morning incredibly horny (weird, I know), and I get really intense dreams and often totally sleep through my alarm(s).

Sorry this post is a bit rambly, but the lack of sleep really erodes my willpower and is generally the reason I fail my quit attempts. I guess I'm asking if this is a common thing, and how long I should prepare myself for it to last? I'm coming into the second last week of semester and don't want to be dealing with this during heavy assessment time, but I can't afford to smoke any longer, financially and healthwise.

Don Draper helped me quit

believe it or not this is a herbal cigarette.

He quit smoking when he was 24 and he just smoked herbals cigs on the set which he says  they're "Terrible. They taste like a mixture between pot and soap" 

   But being a great actor he made it look cool and enjoyable. 
  That's what not smoking will become. Enjoyable. You can draw power from it. You can say "My life isn't going too well right now, but damn it at least I don't smoke" 
   Hopefully this helps, knowing Don Draper smoked shitty herbal cigs for ~~authenticity~~  money

I actually wrote more about quitting smoking on my blog if anyone is curious

The thing with quitting, you never knows what will click and when, you just have to keep trying - so I wish you all goodluck !

Feel like I can definitively say, "I quit!".

So this weekend was a huge triumph for me.

I've been smoking for about ~2 years now and quit on Saturday 03/19/16.

Over this weekend however I rolled Molly for the first time in my life, and despite the urge to smoke. Both my heart and brain were telling me "the happiness from smoking is a lie". I listened, and even today I'm feeling super happy about the whole thing.

I'm going to keep this going and make something more out of quitting. Thanks for reading!

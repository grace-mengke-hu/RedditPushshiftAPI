6 months off cigarettes. No regrets.

Hi all,

It's 6 months since I last had a cigarette. Hell to the yeah!  I moved onto vaping on July 1st and stepped down the nicotine quantity in the vape juice from 8 down to 5 to 3, then to 1 and then 0. It was here on reddit and also on twitter that I got a lot of support so want to return the favour if I can. 

I haven't had nicotine in my vape in about 3 months or so. I carry it everywhere with me as a sort of coping mechanism but I barely use it now at all. Only when the cravings get very strong which can happen from time to time.

If I can do it, you can too. So many people try to quit by going onto vape but they never step down the nicotine quantity. This will never work because you're always going to be getting nicotine and therefore will always crave a cigarette. You've just substituted.

And that's fine too but to get off them for good, you're gonna need to get off nicotine for good. I found stepping down gradually from 8 to 1 very easy with zero effect on my mood or anything. It was maybe a little bit tough going from 1 to 0. Slightly.

And it's been relatively smooth now for a while but the cravings will come, here and there, usually having a nice memory of smoking or something like that, but they pass really quickly and all in all, there were no relapses.

There was maybe one or two moments in the whole time that I've considered having a cigarette but it wasn't strong enough to get me to do it. Since I gave up, I've found that I go to the shop less, so spend less money, even when I take the cigarette savings out of it.

I'm now healthier, happier, have more money, proud of my achievements, not have anxiety attacks in the middle of the night (or in the shower) anymore, I also look healthier and am sleeping way, way better. I hope this helps even one person to quit. It's so worthwhile. 

No regrets.

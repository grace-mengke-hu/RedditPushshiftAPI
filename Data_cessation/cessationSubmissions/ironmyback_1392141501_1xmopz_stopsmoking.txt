Quitting to gain weight...

Hi all,

Enough it enough! I need to quit!! Right, enough of my attempt at keyboard'rage.

Right, here's the deal. I want put on some weight, mainly some bulk. I have been going to the gym for a while now and I can lift at intermediate level, given my body weight of 50kg (1). So the strength is there but my body doesn't seem to hold the weight, my cells aren't sucking in the glucose/glycogen etc. Basically, the nicotine side-effect of Insulin Resistance is holding me back from my goals. Hence why I don't wanna go down the nicotine vaping route.

I remember about 2 years ago when I suddenly stopped for 6 months, people commented that I had put on some weight. I don't recall how much but it must have been noticeable. But then I got love struck which blew up in my face and since then I spiralled back down into being a nicotine addict. 

Now I feel that I am ready to stop smoking again.

For about a month, I haven't been smoking my usual 10 cigs a day, in fact for the first few weeks I hardly smoked any. But these last two weeks, I've been puffing 5-6 a day. This can only mean that I'm falling back into the trap and that I'm losing self control.

But fear not! As of tomorrow, I am packing them in once and for all. I know that if I can go 2 weeks without a smoke then it'll get easier after that. Plus, if the scale goes up (and my shirts feel tighther hehe) then that will motivate me to stop.

Anyways, don't know why I felt like posting this and I'm sure you've all read stories like this before but just felt like letting it out.

Whilst I'm here, can you share your weight gain journey. How much did you gain, what was the rate? Did your gains peak at a certain week/month etc. I dunno, just give me something to read haha.

Oh, and yeah. I also wanna do it for the health benefits, I want my skin to glow again. Get my skin complexion back. And saving benefits.

Thanks for reading.

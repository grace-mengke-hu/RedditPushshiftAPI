End of Day 2 Thoughts

So here I am at the end of day 2 without tobacco. Wasn't expecting to have cravings, or withdrawal symptoms to speak of at all, really (wasn't smoking that much due to money), and that's stayed true.

I did have one craving, but I just rolled up some tea and smoked that when I had it, so no big deal. 

Noticing my sense of smell returning (my room smells faintly of old sweat -> I need to do laundry) and the cough is well underway. 

I don't care that I don't have cigarettes, but I miss 'em.

Just gave in and had a cigarette. Feeling pretty disappointed in myself.

I'm 28 and this is my second attempt at quitting. Last year I quit for two months and felt so much healthier and had so much more energy. 

Just went three days without smoking but gave in pretty quickly and had a cigarette. I am disappointed in myself as I really do want to quit this time. I've just thrown out all smoking paraphernalia and even though I was weak this time, it won't happen again. It won't. 

I can't remember the last time I had a cigarette and enjoyed it. I just want to be free of the addiction. I will be stronger in the future. 

I know this isn't the most interesting of posts, just wanted to put it down how I am feeling about giving in and smoking so soon after quitting. 

Good luck to everybody on here who is quitting!

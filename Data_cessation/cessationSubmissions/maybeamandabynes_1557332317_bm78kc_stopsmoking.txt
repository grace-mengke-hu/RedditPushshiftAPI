Question about the patch?

So I relapsed after two weeks of withdrawal from hell and have been on the patch this time around for 4 days now. Cravings have been mild which is great but I’m still having some of the withdrawal symptoms just not as extreme as before?

The big one last time was complete inability to sleep and now I’m having trouble again just a little less extreme, but I thought the patch would help to not go through that again?

Is this normal?

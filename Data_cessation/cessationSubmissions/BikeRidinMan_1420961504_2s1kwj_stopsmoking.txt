Cancer of the wallet

A big motivation for me to quit was financial. Two pack a day smoker (Winston reds). I was going to college and had roommates (all smokers). All were moochers and bummed smokes from me all the time. I was really having problems paying me bills. Once I quit, my roomies never believed it would stick. I had tried in the past, tossed packs of smokes out the car window only to buy more later that day. I wish everyone the best to quit forever in this new year. BRM

I want to get back on the wagon

I need to stop smoking cigarettes again. I had a great four months free, and then I tried so, so hard to get back addicted to them. I got fidgety and I got bored and I slipped. It hasn't taken too long to realize that I  really do hate cigarettes and I want to get them back out of my life. Unfortunately, I slipped hard enough and long enough that I'm way addicted again. I'm writing this still smoking, but as the first step in declaring my full commitment to quitting.

Cigarettes are dirty and nasty.It makes my woman upset with me. I have ashes all over my apartment. I cough like an old man. My teeth are getting stained. My breath and clothes smell like shit. The Cambodian knockoff cigarettes I'm smoking are likely giving me third world cancer. I can't go out for food without smoking cigarettes in between. Fuck cigarettes. 

And with that; I'm going to quit. Wish me luck.

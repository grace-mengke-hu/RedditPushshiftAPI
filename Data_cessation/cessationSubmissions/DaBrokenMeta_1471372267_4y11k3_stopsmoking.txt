3 Year, 1 pack every two weeks smoker. Right Lower Lobe Lung Pain persists 1 month after quitting.

Hey all. First off thanks for taking the time to read this. I just need some second opinions on this. 

So I am 23, started smoking cigs at 20, and averaging out the 3 years, I was probably a 2 packs a month smoker. I finally got everything sorted and am on a (knock on wood) promising road to absolution of my mind and body. 

About 3 months ago, when I was chain smoking, drinking, and playing video games all day pretty bad over the weekends, I started getting this notted pain in my right lower lobe about mid back. I have stopped everything and have been doing great. But this pain, which would only manifest during drags has stayed. What is weird to me is It currently doesn't exaccerabte during heavy breathing. Its just kind of there. It also doesn't feel musculoskeletal because if I put pressure on the exterior surface of my back in that spot, I don't get any reproducable tenderness.

Anyone else have this feeling? I plan to see my doc, just curious if anyone else feels this kind of notted pain in the posterior base of their lungs.

Thanks and God speed friends

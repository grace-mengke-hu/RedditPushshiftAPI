Things that help me get through this...

It's been only 3 days into my newest attempt to dump these cancer sticks, but I thought I would write a post about what helped me before, when I quit for over a year. 

By far, the biggest help when I had cravings would be the voice in my head, telling me:" Remember, this will only last for 10 minutes and it's gone! If you smoke one now, you will stink like shit again. Do you really want to buy a pack again? Smell like shit. You know it will make you feel like crap! Just last for 10 minutes and this craving will be gone!" That's what helped me the most. 

Second thing was, that I would always take deep breaths when I had a craving.  Just breathe deep! 

Stay active! Do something! Get busy. Go for a run, workout, do something around the house, do laundry, wash your car. Anything...anything to keep you moving. 

I can not stress this enough too...change your diet. What I found out is that if I eat shit, right away, I would crave a smoke. I would then smoke it, and the whole circle starts over again. I feel lazy, don't want to do anything, might as well smoke this whole pack and start over again when it is finished. 

NO!
None of that shit! Done! 

We can do it peeps. We really can. Just think about it... as Allan Carr says, None of the smokers want to smoke. How crazy is that?

Next time you want to light up, just think about how shitty it will make you feel. That dizziness that you feel when you smoke one after not smoking for a while. That doesn't feel good at all. Smell your hands..how bad they stink. Everyone around you can smell it.

Take deep breaths...the craving lasts only for 10 minutes.. Remember that!

Hanging out with smokers

I'm back in town with old friends for a wedding, all my old smoking friends. There was lots of drinking and fun and smoke breaks. I stepped outside, was offered a cig and was able to turn it down without feeling like I really wanted it. I felt like a non smoker that just had no interest in it. Thanks r/stopsmoking and good luck to everyone out there!

Quitting in the third world

I’ve recently moved to Myanmar, and they sell cheap loose cigarettes on almost every street corner. No matter how hard I try to quit, it seems I have a 5 cent Red Ruby cig in my mouth before I know it.  I’m not new to the third world, with it’s lax indoor smoking laws and social acceptability; hell, I managed to not smoke for one of my three years in China. This country is especially tough, though. They’re everywhere, and sold one at a time. Every time I try to quit I find myself ‘just smoking one’ again. How do I stop?

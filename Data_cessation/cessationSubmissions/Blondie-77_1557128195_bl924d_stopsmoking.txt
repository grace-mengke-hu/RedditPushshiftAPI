Is this normal?

My thoughts have been going back to quitting smoking. To give you context. I have always been one to think, I can always quit and I'm not addicted. This same time last year I had lived with someone who really enjoyed her cigs. Cigarettes  with coffee and most importantly drinking. I used to only smoke when drinking and after meeting my friend.  I noticed my habits picked up. Now a year later,  it has become my own stress reliever, crutch and absolutely habit.

Today, after not having a smoke for 8 hours. *I found myself in my sleep deprived state experiencing heart palpitations, anxiety, and overall nervousness? Is this normal and does it get better?* How long until it stops? I found myself smoking with my co-worker after my shift.

I'm also worried I'll gain weight. For the short periods of times I did stop myself. I do think, I gravitated towards candies, snacks and meals. I realise I can easily over come this however, *what are your experiences with weight? Is weight a problem I shouldn't be fixated on?*

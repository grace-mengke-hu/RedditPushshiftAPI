How should I go about quitting smoking?

I'm in college, and a lot of my interaction comes from sitting around the smoking area, chainsmoking and talking to people. I have no idea what I would even do if I would quit. I have no motivation, and I don't really have the discipline to quit. I'm really just looking for any sort of advice, on how to quit!

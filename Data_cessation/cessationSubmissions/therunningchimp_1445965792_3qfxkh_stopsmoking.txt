Can I avoid getting a sore throat?

I'm 17 years old and I have been smoking for two years now. I usually had a pack for a whole week at least 4-5 months, but I would always bum a cigarette almost every day. Now I'm trying to quit, but it sucks because I always get sore throats that lasts way too long. Longest I have gone without a cigarette is maybe 2,5 weeks before giving in because of the throat. I use Swedish snus as a nicotine replacement, but that's not the problem. My throat is killing me, and I don't know what to do. Is there any medicine I could get from the doctor? Anyone here who has any tips? And how long do you reckon  it will last, if I just fight through it? I'm in dire need of help! Thank you for any advice or help!:)

Can’t sleep and in pain

I’m on day 9 no nicotine. My cravings haven’t been too bad although I did have a minor meltdown around dinner time. It’s almost four in the morning and I have been tossing and turning alll night. My stomach hurts. My head hurts. My back hurts. I’m not sure how much of this all can be attributed to quitting but I’m miserable. Anyone else have these problems?

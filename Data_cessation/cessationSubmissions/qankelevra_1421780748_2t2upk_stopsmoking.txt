Day 10! Until now it has been easy but I know I'm on the pink cloud right now. How do I survive the fall?

I have been trying to quit for the last 3 years now, always failed. This has been my longest streak ever and I'm very proud of myself.

But I have read and heard a lot of quitting story's but I want mine to be permanent.

What can/should I do/keep in mind to survive my fall off the pink cloud?

Thanks!

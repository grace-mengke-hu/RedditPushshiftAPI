So, I'm having a bit of trouble.

I've tried quitting literally hundreds of times in my 26 years of smoking.  I've done the patches, the gum, the Chantix, the cold turkey, all of it.  Nothing seems to work.  I've read Carr's book like 3 times now and I start out strong but I always crumble.  What am I doing wrong?  Any help would be appreciated.

Anxiety strong

Arghh. Here I am again. I’m nearly 2 full days in, and going well except for the incredible anxiety (which is what caused me to relapse both times in the last few months). 

It’s different to cravings, it’s the urge to cry, scream and collapse. Though I know it’s related to the cravings it’s kinda separate, you know? Just amplified by the lack of nicotine.

Does anyone have tips for overcoming anxiety in the first few weeks of a quit, specifically day 3 and week 3? 

Edit: I don’t want to smoke. The smell, the taste, the money etc makes me ill. But the anxiety I’m feeling is scary and then only way I know how to make it stop is nicotine

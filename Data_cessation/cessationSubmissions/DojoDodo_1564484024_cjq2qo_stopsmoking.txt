Why is snus kinda illegal in Europe and why can't I buy nicotine patches under 18, but tabacco in every fuel station?

I kind of hate the tobacco situation in Europe. For me it's more easy to get my hands on tobacco, than on alcohol.
If I want to buy a creme liquor, with my 17 years, like baileys with only a few percent more than a wine has, I will have a hard time finding anyone who wants to sell me that. But if it comes to tobacco it's like everywhere.
Startet as a party smoker at 16 and now Im a full blown addict with 7-10 Zigarettes per day. It's kinda nerv wrecking. The worst thing is, that i can just go to like every shop I want and can buy tobacco and no one will ask me for my ID.
Yesterday I tried snus for the first time. It's like nicotine patches  you can't buy  at normal stores because pharmacy shops will always ask for your ID if it comes to such things. I also still don't get why snus is illegal to sell in the rest of the EU outside Sweden. The only thing I could imagine is the tabac Industry who sees the benefit in making people addicted to the habit to just smoke a zig. Sweden has a incredible low smoking rate because of snus.
I think snus could bring through the time where I just lost the habit of smoking a zig and than I can stop more easily I hope.

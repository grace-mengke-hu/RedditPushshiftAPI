Day 3 and feeling good

Hey everyone! Today starts my third day of no smoking and to be honest I feel great. Ive had the normal cravings here and there but nothing that really gets me to my core. Even to that end the cravings are few and far between. In order to pull this off I set up a little game plan. I work in a small office of ten people and told them all I was quitting smoking. They all happily agreed to help and support me so that is good. Other than that I have been keeping away from triggers for this moment in time, coffee and tea is just replaced by hot water and lime, and i go outside every once in a while for a few deep breaths of air. 
I will keep you guys posted as the weeks go on and if I discover any other ways that have helped me. I know this is a uphill battle, and im a fighter, but when it comes to this ordeal I know hoping back on the band wagon is not a failure and a possibility but it is a lesson in learning more about myself and refining my strengths. I saw a quote that has also helped me a lot with quitting. It goes something like this " You're going to have a cigarette arent you? Well dont fucken think about doing that. Besides it being bad for you, no one wants to hang around someone that smells like an ashtray". I am definitely paraphrasing that but it really has helped me with all of this. 
Hears to keeping strong everyone! See you guys around!

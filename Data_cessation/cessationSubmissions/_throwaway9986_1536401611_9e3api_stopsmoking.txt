Is this a good idea to try and get my parents to stop smoking?

My idea is to simply search things like "How to get parents to stop smoking" on our family desktop, open a few of the first links, and pretend I forgot to exit the browser so that when my parents see what I had searched last they'll understand my concern.  Is this a good or bad idea?

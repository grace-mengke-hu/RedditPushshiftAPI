Farewell and good luck r/stopsmoking !

Well after nearly 2 years of being a non smoker I've decided to unsubscribe from this subreddit. I am so thankful for this group even though I wasn't a super active member, reading your achievements, downfalls and facts kept me going. Best of luck to you, stay strong and know that if you slip up one day it's just one day and one cigarette get right back on the wagon! Thanks again guys!

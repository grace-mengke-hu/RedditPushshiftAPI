AAAARRGGGHHH FUCK SMOKING

I hate every goddamned cigarrette I put in my mouth, I hate the taste, the smell, the short breath, the coughing, the money it costs... Why the fuck cant I quit for more than an hour? Why the fuck do I keep paying to kill myself, why do I put tar in my lungs first thing in the morning instead of taking a deep breath? Jesus christ this is exhausting. Sorry for the vent

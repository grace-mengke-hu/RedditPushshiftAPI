Spouse of a smoker looking for tips or advice

Hi everyone, Im sorry if this isn't the right sub for my post:   


Im the spouse (37F) of a smoker (43M).  He is fairly new to smoking.  It used to be only when he was out drinking socially, but now its nightly at home alone.  He generally waits until I go to bed to smoke, and then I think he smokes around half a pack a night, and sleeps on the sofa.    He's going out less which is good but the smoking has increased.  This pattern has been going on for about a year.  

&amp;#x200B;

He has a stressful job and trying ex-wife situation. He's using cigarettes to cope.

&amp;#x200B;

I dont think he's smoking much during the day (yet...) but I cant be sure.  I'm sure its only a matter of time.   


He thinks he's successfully hiding it from me (cute / silly), but I see the receipts and smell it in his hair. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just after some advice or tips from anyone who has experience with this.   Is it a good idea for me to intervene?  Does anyone have any suggestions about how I approach him?    


He's been taking Naltrexone (The Sinclaire Method) to help him drink less alcohol, and I feel like such a wet blanket having to worry about this now too.   


I feel like now is a good time to stop this given it is fairly new.    So I feel compelled to do something, but... what?!

&amp;#x200B;

I would love any advice!! THANK YOU

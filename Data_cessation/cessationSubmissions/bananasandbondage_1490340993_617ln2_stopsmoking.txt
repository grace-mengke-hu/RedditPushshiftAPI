21 going on 80

It's almost 4pm where I live right now. I've smoked five cigarettes today - one on the way to uni, one during my break between classes, another on the way home and two more since I've gotten home.


I started smoking soon after I turned 18. I used to be a stoner and the day after I went cold turkey a friend offered me a cigarette. At first smoking cigarettes helped me curb my cravings for bud, then I kept smoking because it helped curb my appetite. But here I am three and a half years later; I haven't smoked weed in years and my eating disorder is long gone... and I'm still fucking smoking.


On a normal day, I'd probably smoke three or four more cigarettes before going to bed. That last cigarette before going to bed is my *favourite* part of the day. But not anymore because **I fucking QUIT.**


I'm sick of smoking. I'm sick of feeling like shit. I'm sick of smelling like shit. I'm sick of cleaning layers of ash from my car every week. I'm sick of wasting my money. I'm sick of worrying over how, when and where I can step outside to smoke during social occasions. I'm sick of all the anxiety it gives me worrying that people will smell it. I'm sick of feeling so ashamed.


I've been trying to quit for the past couple of months now to no avail. I kept telling myself that I'll quit smoking after that final cigarette before going to bed so I can wake up 'fresh'. But what do I do? I drive my sorry ass down to the petrol station and buy a pack first thing in the morning. Just thinking about going the rest of the day without a cigarette makes me nervous, but I've snapped all my cigarettes in half and the bank account is empty. I'm going to go to the gym, spend a looong time preparing dinner and go to bed early tonight.


I fucking hate smoking. It's time I start living my life instead.


**I started smoking on August 18th, 2013. I quit smoking on March 24th, 2017.**

Wish me luck.

How much success am I gonna have

I enjoy smoking but I'm not an idiot, I know I need to quit.  My husband has bitched so much that tomorrow will be my first day, of many times, that I'm laying them down cold turkey.  Mostly because I'm tired of hearing my husband.  So my question is how successful will I be because I'm mostly doing it to hush him up.  I know I need to quit and want to because it's an awful habit.

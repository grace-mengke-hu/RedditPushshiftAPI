Never say fuck it.

Never quit quitting, never give in, not one more puff, no matter what. Over and over again we see the same theme. 

The folks who have managed this have listened, read, and understood, but more importantly, they have applied the advice to their own situations.

Shit happens. People lose jobs, lose lovers, lose loved ones. Get evicted, get diagnosed, get angry, feel uncomfortab;le, get tossed out of their comfort  zones(that's me) get mad, get sad.

An ex smoker coworker recently said ' ya just quit'. Quit is a verb. Synonym -STOP. You do [it.  It](https://it.It)'s not a thing, a place, a time although we tend to layer it with those noun-type qualities. It's a funny sort of verb because if you actually do it, it's supposed to be done. It's a state of mind, maybe. There is no TRY. There is only DO. Or do not, in this case. 

I used emotional bullshit as an excuse to light up again on Monday after a week. This is not the first time that has happened. It's up to me to make it be the last time.

No app or support group is going to make the quit happen for you. They are help only. It is up to each of us.

I'm psyching myself up by writing this. It's all about me :)  JK but it could be all about you, too.  August 1st- I'm done.

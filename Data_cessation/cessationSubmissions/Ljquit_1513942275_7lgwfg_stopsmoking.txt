Nearly 10months quit and I couldn’t remember what brand I used to smoke!

I was talking to a still-smoking friend and was telling him why I like being a non-smoker now (he asked) and I was telling him all the benefits, one of which was cost. When I went to tell him what brand I used to smoke, I couldn’t remember! I’m taking that as a good sign that I am actually over it. So, after 38 years smoking and 10 months quit, I am a non-smoker! I never thought I could do it, but I really wanted to quit. You can do it too!
Other reasons I’m glad I quit: I no longer smell like an ashtray. I’m no longer craving when spending time with my granddaughter - I can focus my attention on her instead of looking for opportunities to duck out for a smoke. I’m enjoying not craving in general - my day does not now revolve around when I can fit in a smoke. The cost - I have saved over $5,000! 
So, fellow quitters - stay strong and keep your eyes on the big picture. You’re stronger than the nicotine. I’ll join you in never taking another puff!

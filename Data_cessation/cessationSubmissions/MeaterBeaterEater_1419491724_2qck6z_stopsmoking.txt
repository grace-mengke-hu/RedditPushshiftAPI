Running stamina worse than before quitting?

Hi guys this is my first post here.  I haven't had a smoke for 31 days.  This ban includes any sort of electronic cigarette and chewing tobacco.

For those of you runners out there, have you felt a considerable decrease in your running ability since you quit smoking?  It seems I'm struggling to run distances I could have tackled relatively easily before and enjoy a cigarette afterwards (God I miss that reward).

Anyone know why this is?  And how I can expedite the process in preparation for a half marathon in four months?

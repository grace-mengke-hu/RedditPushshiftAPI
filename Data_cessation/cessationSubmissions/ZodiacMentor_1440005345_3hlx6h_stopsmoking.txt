Vaping != Smoking? Even when relapsing?

Yeah so, vaping IS NOT smoking. The real question however: if I relapse in my quit, but instead of smoking cigarettes, I'd vape nicotine-free liquid, would that even count as a relapse?

Just thinking that even though my quit's been going strong with my current methods, should I start keeping a loaded e-cig with me at all times, in case I get a craving I can't resist - maybe I could do a sleight of hand in that moment and replace the bad bad cig with relatively harmless vaping?

When do you stop wanting to punch everyone in the face?

Holy shit!  So I sort of accidentally quit a week ago and I've pretty much been going crazy ever since.  I feel constantly annoyed.  Like every second I'm awake.  I also feel like I want to run sprints and punch people.  So when does this stop?

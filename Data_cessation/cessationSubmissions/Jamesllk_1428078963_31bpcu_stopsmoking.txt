3 Days In

I've been smoking for 18 years. That's the number I keep telling myself. For me, 18 is just too long. Now I'm 3 days in and I'm proud of how far I've come. Last night when I went out I realized how absent or not present I've been. Every time I was doing something like a concert, comedy club, dinner or whatever I was just waiting to go out and smoke.

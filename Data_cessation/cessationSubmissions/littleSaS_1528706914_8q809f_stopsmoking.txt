Just checking in to re-assure everyone that this is totally do-able.

It is.

I smoked for 35+ years. I smoked at least 20 a day, 40 if I was out drinking with friends. I smoked when I was well and I smoked when I was ill. I was that person who got off an hour flight and had to get out of the airport so I could have a smoke. When I travelled to Europe, I was that person standing in the smoking cubicle in Bangkok airport breathing in clouds of other people's smoke so I could create my own contribution to the cloud. 

I loved to smoke. 

I would wander away from the crowd at parties to smoke, I would smoke in my friends backyards and stink up their houses when I came back inside. 

After reading the Allen Carr book, The Easy Way to stop Smoking, I stopped. Just like that. It would have been easier to keep smoking, sure, but it wasn't cripplingly difficult to stop. 

444 days and going strong!!

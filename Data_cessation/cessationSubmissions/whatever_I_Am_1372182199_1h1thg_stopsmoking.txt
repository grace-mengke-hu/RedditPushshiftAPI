Looking for info and big advice. Need to quit not only for monetary purposes but he health risks as well

Good afternoon everyone, 

Looking for the best ways to quit and any advice you have to offer. I started smoking when I was about 17 right after I graduated high school. Gradually made my way up to a pack a day, and have been doing so for probably about two years now. I honestly could not tell you how long. I am roughly 300lbs so the time to stop is now. 

I've tried to reach the source of my addiction, mainly why I feel the need to smoke a cig, it's mostly stress of work and BOREDOM. 

Im done wasting money on these things and killing myself. I need to make a change soon or it will not be pretty.

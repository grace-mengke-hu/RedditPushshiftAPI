23 years smoking... trying seriously to quit

I have been smoking for 23 years now(I started right before I turned 7, and by 8 I was smoking half a pack a day... last 10 years has been about a pack a day)

I have gone a few days without one before, but I always get stressed and pick up a pack on the way to work trying to work it out.  I have lied to friends and family about quitting, and hid it very well(This time I have been hiding it since september...  Only smoking at work, going out to grab takeout for everyone and having a quick one in the parking lot).

Kind of sick of the hiding it, and I really do want to start working out... which is hard with the condition my lungs are in.  Just so hard to actually get through a day of work without having one(Fairly high level position, lots of stress).

Just trying to get some things off my chest.

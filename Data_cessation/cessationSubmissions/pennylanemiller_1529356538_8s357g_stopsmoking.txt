Stopped cigarettes and weed, why do I feel so insecure ?

So it's been 10 days since I quit smoking cigarettes, and decided to also stop weed at the same time .

I have 14mg nicotine patches and the not smoking part is not too hard ; I do have some cravings but they pass quite fast ; Not smoking week is okay too, mostly because I did not used to smoke that much. 

The problem is that  I feel like CRAP.  I'm tired, I have zero motivation for anything, I'm crying for stupid reasons, I have headaches, insomnia... The whole package. Wich honestly would be okay if that was it. But the absolute worst is that I feel super insecure. I've always been pretty confidend and independant and I feel like a totally different person, I feel like I'm stupid, ugly, unintersting, I feel like my boyfriend is going to dump me anytime because I'm such an awful person, I need to call him all the time qnd know what he's doing and stuff I NEVER did in my life, ever.  Basically I feel like a needy insecure and annoying fifteen years old girl and this is not a good feeling. 

I know this is propably due to the withrawal and stuff, but I do have nicotine patches so aren't they supposed to kind help with that ? I won't go back to smoking because of that, but feeling so depressed and insecure is really, really hard.

I've tried some exercice, seeing friends, taking a bath etc and it helps... For maybe half an hour. 

Anyway, if someone had to go throught the same shit I would be happy to hear about it, knowing I'm not the only one would help ! Or any kind of advice actually.

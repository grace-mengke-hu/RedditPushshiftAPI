chest pains with quitting?

so i have only smoked cigs a few times but i never got hooked on those thankfully, i never really liked them. ive vaped for years (maybe 5 or so idk) &amp; i wanna quit because i’ve been trying to be healthier and gain weight etc. i’ve been trying to cut down my nicotine, and i just put 0mg juice in my novo and i do crave the nicotine but its not as bad as i expected. more than anything i just want to actually smoke bc that’s the real habit i’ve realized i need to kick. i’ve stopped taking it with me places and tried to reduce how much i actually hit it. 
that’s just some backstory tho, this morning i went to work and i was having pains in my chest (i take adderall and i have coffee everyday, i didnt have very much coffee today in comparison to how much i usually drink). other than that, i’m pretty healthy. has anyone else experienced any pains with quitting or should i see a doctor?
it’s also important to note that ive been using a 70/30 juice in my novo instead of 50/50 bc its the only one with 0mg. don’t know if that makes a difference but yeah. thanks guys

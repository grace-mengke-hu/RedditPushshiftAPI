Day 19

Is Best Day! I just felt like you all should know. I never thought I would realize this, but I was sitting in the car with my brother and he was smoking and I wanted to throw up. I didn't want one. 19 days ago I never thought I would have made it this far. But I have. Yesterday I didn't have any cravings whatsoever and I wouldn't have thought about smoking at all if it weren't for my brother. Friends, keep on keeping on and I can promise you those cravings will pass even when you don't act upon them.

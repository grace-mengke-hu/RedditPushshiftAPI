It's hard to stay off cigs when you feel like you have nothing going for you.. (80 days)

Using a throwaway account.

Okay.. Rant time..

I'm 19 years old. Male. I have already come so far with not smoking (I quit cold turkey), but lately I'm having troubles staying on track.

I've been going through a rough time mentally. I'm dirt poor, I have gained tons of weight, I still can't make any friends at school, I'm struggling with school, I have very low self esteem. I just can't seem to pull myself out of this rut.

I go to school, I come home, I do nothing else. I have no hobbies, no interests, and nobody to do anything with. It just gets me down sometimes. I even broke down today for the first time in ages. I feel like I've failed in life.

I'm still young, but I can't bring myself to believe that it will get better. I'm not suicidal, I'm just exhausted.

I'm having a hard time not going and buying a pack. It was the only thing bringing me happiness.

Sorry for the rambling, just wanted to get it off my chest.

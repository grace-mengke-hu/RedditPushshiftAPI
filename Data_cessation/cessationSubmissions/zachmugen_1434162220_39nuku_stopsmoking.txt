Triggers

I've a big trip coming up next week. Flying always makes me nervous so I used to squash that nervousness with cigarettes. However, I now realize that smoking didn't work to kill the nerves, it just gave me something to do while I paced about all scared. Now, I have to distract myself so I've been drinking a few beers at night to calm myself. It actually works, though I should probably find some kind of mental trick so that I don't need depressants to lower my anxiety.

In any case, I also wanted to say that I still get some strong cravings but not as often as before! This group helps a lot, so thank you to everyone telling their stories. This is a great place to get support.

One Month!

I honestly didn't know if I would make it to a month. I just told myself, "Today, I will not smoke." And guess what? Today, I will not smoke. Yesterday, I didn't smoke. And tomorrow? I'll be telling myself, "Today, I will not smoke." I check this sub every day, whenever I get a craving, and can honestly say the thought of resetting my badge has saved me from smoking several times!

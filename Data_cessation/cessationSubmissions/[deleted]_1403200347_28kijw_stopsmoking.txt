Two weeks ago today...

Two weeks ago today I finally made the descision to get serious about quitting smoking. Ever since then, each day has been a constant battle. One moment I feel fine, then another I want to sit down, light up a cig and relax. As if stopping cigarettes wasn't a challenge, things only got more interesting after my e-cig broke. I switched to a nicotine suppliment that came in mint form and it was enough to at least curb enough of the cravings that my Willpower could handle. This has felt like an eternity yet am surprised how much time has already passed. The increased paranoia, speediness to anger and mild shakes have been tough to get through. I still get cravings and the temptation to go out to my beck deck and kill a few minutes smoking is always there...  but I continue on because of the things I've added to my list. The benefits such as regaining a more defined taste of food, not waking up with the feeling of pain in my throat, not having crap on my tounge and of course not smelling like smoke. In the last two days I haven't even used the nicotine mints because I want to lessen my dependancy altogether. I have noticed an increase in my own ability to manage stress at work and have noticed better moods whenever I go out on the town or even just sit back and enjoy my game. I do need to be careful and have been doing my best to not compensate the lack of cigarettes with food. I'm going to have to start going outside more often, which is actually another positive thing.

I intend to keep going forward. I've come this far and don't want to stop. There's no reason to pick up that habbit again, even when out on the town. I've actually managed to develop a taste for better beers than Coor's Light and have been tasting other beers that I've enjoyed almost as if they were something new. The tmeptation will always be there, but I know and feel that this is the time when I don't loose sight of why I stopped.

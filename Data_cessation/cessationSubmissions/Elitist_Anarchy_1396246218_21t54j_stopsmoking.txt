I need help! Looking to stop, but it's just too damn hard

I've been smoking now for a while (+1yr ) and am really trying to stop. Lenten promises didn't work and neither did new years. I'm fine when it comes to abstaining from packs, but everywhere I go, there's always a place I can buy 2-3 Lucy's for cheap. These kids of places are deterring me from stopping but one store is right around the corner from my house and the other along my commute. 

What do I do?

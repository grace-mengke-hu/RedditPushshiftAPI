How do I break habits and deal with nicotine withdrawal?

I want to quit smoking, and I’ve tried a few times, but I just haven’t yet.  I think the hardest part is breaking habits.  Every time I drive, I smoke.  I don’t even think about it.  It’s just a natural response.  It feels wrong to drive without smoking.  The only time I drive without smoking is when I have other people in the car who don’t smoke and I’m trying to be respectful, but even then, all I can think about is waiting to either drop them off or get out of the car so that I can smoke.

Then, there’s work.  I don’t get smoke breaks, but I always smoke a cigarette before I eat lunch and again after I eat lunch.  A big reason why I don’t stop smoking is because I’m afraid of dealing with nicotine withdrawal at work.  I work in a loud factory, so even with earplugs, the noise and the fluorescent lights already give me headaches as it is.  I’m afraid of how much worse it would be with nicotine withdrawal.

Finally, there’s weed.  I think that this would be the easiest habit to break.  I live with my parents, and they know that I smoke weed and cigarettes.  They don’t even really care that I do, but I’m uncomfortable with smelling like weed at home, so every time I smoke weed, I smoke a cigarette afterwards just to cover up the scent of weed.  For whatever reason, smelling like cigarettes is more comfortable for me.  With this habit, I think that I just have to learn to stop caring whether or not I smell like weed at home.  The only issue is how do I do that?

I CANNOT stop eating... any ideas.

So i am a full week in. The not smoking part sucks (real bad) but i have been dealing with it surprisingly well just by acknowledging that i want to smoke, realizing that it sucks, but that i am not going to do it, and letting the feeling pass. BUTT i am eating like there is no tomorrow. Used to hate sweet, now i love them. Used to NEVER snack, holy shit, theres not enough time in the day to snack as much as i want to. I understand that i am obviously filling my cig hole with food but does anyone have an experience with combatting this? I am eating like when i was 14 again, and i am not 14 so that shit is gonna add up so some serious poundage... 


and ive subscribed to this subreddit for like a year, im glad i actually can post now.

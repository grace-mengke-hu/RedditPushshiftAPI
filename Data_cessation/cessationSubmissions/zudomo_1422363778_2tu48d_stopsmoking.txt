Some additional motivation if you need it

One of the biggest surprises for me when quitting was how much more time I had. So let's put it into numbers.

The average cigarette takes 7 minutes to smoke. At a pack a day this is the amount of time spent smoking.  

1 Day: 2.33 hours.  

1week: 16.33 hours. 

1 month: 65.33 hours. 

1 year: 784 hours. 

10 years: 7,840 hours.  

I smoked for ten years. You ever hear that to master something you need to spend 10,000 hours on it? I could have almost mastered something with all the time I spent on smoking.

And believe me, you notice the extra time in the day.

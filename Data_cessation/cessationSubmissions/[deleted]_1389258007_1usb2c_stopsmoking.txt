New here, and I want to quit smoking.

Hey everyone, I just found out about this sub. I've been smoking for about 3 and a half years now. I really want to quit but it's hardest thing to do. I've tried asking other people for advice but they just tell me stuff like "oh you've only been smoking a short time you'll be fine just stop". Well I've tried that and it's harder to do than people say. My best friend always tells me that he wishs I should stop. He also says that it can't be that hard to quit. As a non smoker I don't think he realizes how hard it truly is. Sorry I started to ramble on, anyway if anyone could give some advice it would be awesome.

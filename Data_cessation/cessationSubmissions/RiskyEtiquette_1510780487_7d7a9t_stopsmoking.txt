Must get sleeeeeep

Quit yesterday on a wimb. Honestly wasn't even planning to but I said fuck it and threw everything away lights 2 packs of cigs and the lot. 1:20am... I've woken up from what seemed to be a decent sleep I fall back asleep after a while. 3:20 am I'm awake for maybe the third time now and have slept like shit. I beg myself not to but have a cig. I haven't had any since this morning, but damnit how do yo u get to sleep normal people? What's the trick I need it now

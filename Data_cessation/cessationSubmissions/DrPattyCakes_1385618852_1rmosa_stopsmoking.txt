Going to start day 4 - Thoughts

Day 3 is supposed to be the hardest, I found that the hardest was day 1 at the beginning, just coping with the fact that no, I'm not reaching for another cigarette, and not having said no to any automatic queue in the "attempt"

Today was easy again, I had a couple cravings, once when I was done eating, and once again when I felt too lazy to do some chores.
In the end, who cares?! It's easy! The fact that I'm saying it's easy too is making it even easier. I'm telling my friends that it's easy too!

The drug has no hold on me! After all the attempts, I think I'm one of those anomalies that you hear about. Y'know, those who tell you quitting was easy, I think it's all in the mindset though because my previous times weren't exactly cakewalks like this time is.

I think I finally kicked it, guys!
I'm not naive though, I'll keep posting progress, and making this my stop smoking journal! It's comforting, and makes me feel awesome!

Also, alcohol has no hold on me wanting a cigarette! Going to grab my daily unwinding beer, and celebrate! (one bottle) :P

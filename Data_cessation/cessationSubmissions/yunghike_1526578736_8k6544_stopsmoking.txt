Day 7, I think that I'm before the worst part of quitting

I quit smoking e-cig one week ago(after 5 years). First day was okay, second and third days were a real nightmare. I was regretting my decision and I couldn't focus on anything. Fourth-Sixth days were not bad, I started smiling again, got some energy back and started thinking less about smoking. Today is the 7th day and I have a feeling that battle between me and my addiction isn't over yet, I want to smoke so badly till I woke up, and I also think again about smoking in situations when I used to smoke. When I smoked normal cigs there were some barriers that stopped me from smoking, for example: you couldn't smoke there, there and there, some of your friends didn't like the smell of cigs, etc. Starting vaping was probably the worst decision of my life, because it smells nice, it isn't that harmful to your body as normal cigs (probably) etc. It's just ,,better" way of smoking. The worst thing is that I could vape everywhere I wanted, even if it was forbidden, no one would give a f if you were vaping there, because the smell and cloud were disappearing after few seconds. It was also a very good time killer and now I'm feeling kinda empty when I can't smoke my e-cig, I don't really know how I can replace smoking e-cig in my free time. I'm sorry for such a long post, but I wanted to share it with you.

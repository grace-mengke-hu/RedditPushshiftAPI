This is 5th quit and I made it this far ...1 month...

Last night I search for a cigarette in my bag and cannot find one. Very frustrating lol. So, my friend give me one cig and I smoke! To be honest, it was so relaxing. Then I feel very bad that I fail quitting again.

Then I woke up and feel sorry about 10 minutes until I realized it was just a dream.

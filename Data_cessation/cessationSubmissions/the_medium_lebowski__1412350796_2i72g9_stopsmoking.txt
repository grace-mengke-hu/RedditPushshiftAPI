Made it a whole week! I do have a question though...

First week has gone as smoothly as I could've hoped. No cravings I couldn't overcome. Friends & girlfriend are supportive. I had a few nights of poor sleep but nothing too bad. Feeling great overall!

However, there is one side-effect that really bothers me: my mood/emotions are pretty unstable. Normally I'm pretty laid back, and it actually takes something significant to upset me. But this week, I've gotten set off by the tiniest incidents: a spilled drink at the bar, a minor mess in the kitchen, and accidentally dropping some groceries are a few examples. I'm aware of how insignificant these events are, but they either send me into a fit of rage or turn me into a nervous, shaking wreck on the verge of tears. After a couple minutes I'm normal again and realize how stupid the whole situation is.

My question is, has anyone else experienced this type of behavior? Did it get better over time? Any suggestions for how to cope with or try to prevent these emotional meltdowns? Thanks for the input and support everyone!

Hey, im 22 I've smoked 20/25 fags a day for like 4 years. Im going cold turkey..

I have tried to stop with a vape before but i have something called POTS which in a quick explanation means my resting heart rate is normally quite high so the nicotine in the vape made it go even higher as in cigarettes there is an ingredient which lowers the effect (or something) so im getting a vape today with NO nicotine added juice, does anyone have any advice for cold turkey?? When I last tried i went down to 2-3 fags a day because i dont think i smoke because im addicted i think i do it because i like it etc, any help would appreciate, thankyou all

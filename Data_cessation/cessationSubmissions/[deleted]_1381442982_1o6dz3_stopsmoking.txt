I feel sick...

It's day five and I am straight nauseous. I don't know why... it may be because of other stresses I have right now, aside from not smoking... all I know is I feel very sick and stressed and I feel I am on the verge of a panic attack... I don't have any smokes on me or in the house so I think I will be okay...

I am just really stressed out. I am going to work soon, so hopefully that will help me get my mind off everything.

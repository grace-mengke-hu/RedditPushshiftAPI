In a bad rut

Little background. I was about 6 months smoke free, picked it up again - took chantix, quit again for about 2 months. I now keep catching myself (about 2 weeks now) where i'm either bumming 1-3 a day or buying a pack smoking a couple and thrwoing the pack out. RAnging anywhere from 1-5 in a day. The cravings are back but not sure if I need another cessation program or just some will power to get past this. Any advice?

Almost a week and I'm having severe anxiety... is this normal?

Nothing has been happening in my life that is much different other than I quit smoking cigarettes almost a week ago. I can't be sure that the panic attacks are being triggered by the quit, but it seems like a simple conclusion to make. 

Has anyone, especially those with anxiety disorders, experienced severe anxiety episodes during this time of their quit?

I had a really intense attack just a few hours ago! It has been months since my last one, but this one was just awful... please tell me that this will stop soon :( 

Not sure if worth mentioning, but my quit has been really easy and mostly enjoyable thus far.

Cold Turkey vs Nicotine Replacement

Hi all, set my quit date (24th November) and was just curious as to other peoples experiences in successfully quitting using either the 'Cold Turkey' method or Nicotine Replacement treatments or both. 
I'm 28, been smoking for 12 years and have never really tried to quit. Really would like to make it stick so your stories are very much appreciated.

I got through my first week!

I am so grateful that I have week one of being smoke free under my belt.  I hope it's all down hill from here.  Keep in mind I had been smoking for 36 years, so it was a really big deal for me to actually take action to break this addiction!  Thanks to this group for keeping me focused and inspired.

extreme depression and wanting to do nothing all day after quitting?

ive been smoking less than 6 months but I'm on day 5 after quitting and I've been tending to avoid all social contact and just doing daily activities takes every ounce of energy away from me. I can't remember the last time I've had a proper meal. I'm letting my girlfriend and my friends down as I am so antisocial but I can't continue smoking as I'm leaving for vacation in 2 days and I can't have my dad find out that I smoke. is my willpower too weak to quit cold turkey? what should I do?

Haven't smoked a cigarette in approximately 8 hours. Thank you.

I've been lurking here, waiting for the time to quit. 

I had quit for many years (2005ish-2012ish) as soon as I met my (now) wife - but my father passed (age 54, about 2 years ago), and soon after my brother passed (age 30, 10/31/14, 5am). So, clearly, I started smoking again. Even heavier after my brother died. About a pack and a half a day.

I had five cigarettes left today, and I threw them away when I got to work. I'm done, I hope. I'm almost 30, myself, and I want to have kids. My wife wants to have kids. She's a teacher. I don't want to not be around, given my genetic history, to see them grow. I don't want them to grow up thinking that it's acceptable to smoke. I don't want them to hug me and think, "This is what Daddy smells like."

I'm not a religious person, so I can't say I have faith in anyone but myself. I'm doing this for my wife, my future children and, most importantly, my mother. She's lost her husband, my brother....I can't do anything else to let her lose the last immediate family member she has. 

Any words of encouragement are appreciated, but not necessary. I just felt like finally saying it to everyone. I wanted to after an hour, but we all know that's not a good time. However, it's been 1/4 a day, and I haven't even craved one.

And seeing your posts helped me.

Thanks, everyone.

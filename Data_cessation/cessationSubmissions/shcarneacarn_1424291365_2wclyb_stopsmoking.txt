That's it. I'm done.

I've been lurking on this sub for a while now, trying to find inspiration to quit. I'm a junior in college, and I started smoking my freshman year as a social thing when drunk at parties, and next thing you know, I'm going out a few times a day to smoke while sober. I've managed to "quit" a few times, taking a few months off, but eventually the cycle starts again. I allow myself to smoke when I'm drunk, and then BAM, I'm on a half pack a day.

I always wondered how someone becomes a smoker. Everyone knows it's bad for you. Everyone knows the health risks, but yet, we still do it. All my life, I used to pass slight judgement at smokers, and now I'm one of those people. I don't get it. 

Anyway, I just bought my last pack. I can't even count how many times I've said that, but I always have to hope that this time it's for real. So this time, it is for real.

I don't really know the real purpose of this post, other than to just kind of vent and such. I just figured this is a good place for it. Tips, advice, or any kind of input is encouraged.

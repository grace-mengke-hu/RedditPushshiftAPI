ONE WEEK &lt;3 JAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!&lt;3

Got my new shiny reddit badge, feeling really good about myself, not hating everything in the entire world, and starting to get some moments of normalcy back.  Still fighting the fight, but just one week I see a big difference.  THe depression and panic is way less than it was the first better half of the week, and anyone just starting, keep going.  Don't rely on your feelings just yet, get to one week.  It sucks ass.  I'm not going to lie, but get to one week.  I just realized, I can definitely do this!  Starters, YOU CAN TOO!!!!

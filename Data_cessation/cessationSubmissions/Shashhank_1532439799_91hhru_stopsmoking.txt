Went to the place I first started smoking. Didn’t light up! Major W

Here’s the story : I first started smoking when I was 18. There was smoking area near the Uni where I smoked my first cig. My gang of friends, we used to spend hours smoking one cig after another at that place. Today, I met an old friend at the same place. He lit up, I didn’t. Finally starting to believe I might kick this habit for good this time. Thank you good people of r/stopsmoking, you’ve all been a huge inspiration and support!

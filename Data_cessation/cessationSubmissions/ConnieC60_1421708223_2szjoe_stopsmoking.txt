Seeing the benefits already

I quit back in October and still haven't cracked. I'd been saving my cigarette money in a separate account, and last weekend I used it to put a deposit on a nearly new car which I badly needed. The rest of the payments are easily covered by what I would spend on cigarettes each month, with some left over. I never thought I'd be in a position to have a decent car, and I also never thought I'd stay off cigarettes this long. Now I have an incentive to stay off them - my nice (nearly) new car! The struggle is definitely worth it!

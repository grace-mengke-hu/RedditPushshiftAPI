Constantly surprised at how hard this is

I'm a pretty smart person and I know for sure how much better off I am not smoking.  It's so infuriating that I have to keep reminding myself that having "just one" doesn't mean just one.  I know that they're deadly, but I want them anyway.

I've been here before so I know I can get through it, but it sure does suck today.

Day 3 without a cigarette cold turkey.

I'm 3 days without a smoke and I really don't like myself right now. I'm fucking irritable, and I've been snapping at people and my roommates. Little shit is pissing me off so much more than usual. Ugh, and all I want to do is go outside and light up. I need some help, encouragement, techniques you found helpful when quitting, anything.

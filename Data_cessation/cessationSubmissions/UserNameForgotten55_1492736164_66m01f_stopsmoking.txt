Smoking Is Not Going To Make Anything Better

i know this is true. i am 3 months in. i am so sorry, i seem to post here only when i need help; maybe when i'm stronger i can be the help other quitters need. but here is where i am.

i am the only child of an aging father whose health is failing. i am his power of attorney. his care needs have escalated in recent weeks and i am faced with the task of clearing out his apartment as well as making decisions regarding his immediate future care. what to keep. what to toss. i will also add here that the hardest lesson life keeps bringing me is How To Ask For Help.

i KNOW that lighting up is not going to change my dad's future, or make me stronger in taking responsibility, or bring about a more desirable conclusion. NOTHING WILL BE MADE BETTER... except that this awful urge will be answered and that will be one thing less for me to fight against.

i'm feeling particularly weak in my quit right now. i recognize the "phenomenon of 3's" that have been referenced here, time after time.

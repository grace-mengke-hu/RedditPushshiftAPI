Day 4

It’s been emotional. I have heard bits and pieces of  Allen Carr, I just wanna say, no dude, this isn’t easy!!! (although he really does have wonderful advice that has stuck with me). The cravings are still all day, but a little less severe. Mornings are easier, nights are still difficult. By the end of the day I’m so wound up emotionally and the easily frustrations of the day are piled up and I’m kinda miserable. I have had puffs of an e cigarette to ease the tension (I don’t want the the e cigarette to supplement my usual cigarette intake, but since I’m crying from anger and tension I just take a few puffs to alleviate the tension). 

Anyways y’all. Hoping yous the best. I also went out last night for a few drinks and didn’t have a cig. I’m proud of myself even though I feel like I’m sorta cheating with the e cigarette. But I literally hit it once a day. Good luck everyone :)

NEED HELP allergic to patch?

I've learned that the patch is the only thing that has really ever helped me quit smoking. I've been getting extreme redness and swelling when I apply the patch, it hurts so bad, but I'm trying to bear it to get rid of cigarettes! Is there something that will make the swelling/itch/pain go away? I don't want to give up because as soon as I stop the patch i'm worried I'll smoke

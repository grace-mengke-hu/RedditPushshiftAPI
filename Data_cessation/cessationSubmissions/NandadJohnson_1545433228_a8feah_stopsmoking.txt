Mum has started smoking again

I’m not sure if this fits here but I’ll tell my story anyway. So about 9 months ago my mum quit smoking, I didn’t think she would do because she failed so many times, but she quit but still had to use a nicotine inhaler. There were a few times where she had just one cigarette but she was mostly smoke free. This year she’s had mint injuries and seems to think that the only reason she’s gotten these injuries is because she stopped smoking. At this point I knew she was going to start again. Being on the nicotine inhaler made it worse because she’s still addicted to nicotine and there’s nothing stopping her from getting onto cigarettes again. We were flying out to go on holiday on Wednesday and they were selling cigarettes and she bought 40 packets. I asked why and she said for a workmate. Once we had landed and about to get on the coach she had one, there was no reason why, we had a very easy journey compared to past trips. She said she would only have one a day, I knew it wasn’t true. She’s now gone through almost 10 packets in 2 days. She only got addicted again because there were cigarettes available at a cheap price. What makes this all worse is I’m asthmatic and she still smokes around me even though it sets me off. She’ll even do it when I don’t have my inhaler. She doesn’t care, she only cares about when she can next smoke. She also smokes around peoples kids and she doesn’t care when the smoke goes in everyone’s face. It makes me so angry. She quit for nine months and got back into it just because they were cheap.

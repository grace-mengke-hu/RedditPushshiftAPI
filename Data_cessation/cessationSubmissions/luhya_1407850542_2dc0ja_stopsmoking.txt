Quitting for the last time.

Today I (M, 30) went to see a dentist for treating severe periodontitis. My teeth and gums look really bad, and it's starting to become noticeable to other people. It's embarassing and I almost never smile nowadays. 

Besides that, my cardio is shit, I can't run 2 miles. I tried to quit several times before. and I always end up smoking when going out and drinking, or when I feel a bit depressed. 

I quit smoking yesterday and I am going to use what I learned from this subreddit and my previous attempts to quit. Essentially, I won't drink for a week or two until I get used to not smoking and I will be constantly working out, running, swimming, cycling. I will stop being a couch potato smoking cigarretes all day and I might still be possible to meet my grandchildren, one day.

This time is for good, I quit!

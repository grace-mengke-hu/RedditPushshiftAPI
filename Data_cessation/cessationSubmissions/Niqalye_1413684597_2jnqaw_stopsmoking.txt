I really don't mean to have this make things harder on people quitting, but I am smoke free for over 2 years now and I have been having some serious cravings all the sudden. Anyone else ever have a similar issue?

I've been dreaming about smoking. When people would smoke around me before, it would never really bother me. But now as of recently I envy smokers for some reason. I would hate to come this far and relapse, I'm pretty good at keeping it under control I've never cheated once in the past 784 days but this is pretty rough right now.

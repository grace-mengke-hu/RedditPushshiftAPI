Stay vigilant my friends!

It’s the season to be Jolly I’m 5months no smoking and I’m going to a family gathering tonight and I will be very vigilant of my alcohol intake which I know will be my downfall if I go overboard so I will be drinking minimally! No shots,lol no seriously no shots! Stay healthy my community!! And happy holidays!

Making my 3rd weekly post. Week 2 was much more difficult than week 1.

Two weeks ago I started quitting with the patch.  My plan was also to exercise, but I never got in a rhythm.  Week one was surprisingly easy with the patch.  

This past week I took off the patch and tried to go without it altogether.  So far I've been successful but it's been MUCH more difficult.  I had two nights where I was unbelievably close to picking up a pack and I'm not sure what stopped me. 

This upcoming week I'm going to start exercising like I said I would.  Tonight I most definitely have time and the rest of the week is really slow too so there are no excuses.

Thanks for being a place I can just vent or whatever and a source of encouragement.  Wish me luck on the next week.

Don't fear the weight gain!

I gained about 10 lbs the first 6 months I quit smoking but I've since lost 25 lbs. It's a lot easier to motivate myself to exercise and eat right now that I'm not poisoning myself anyway. It also helps that the barest of exertions no longer cause me to have to stop and catch my breath. So don't worry about a little weight increase at the beginning, it's all worth it.

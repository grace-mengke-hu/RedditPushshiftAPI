Should I start over?

I quit smoking cigarettes 2 months and 23 days ago. A few weeks ago I had a cigar and didn’t think anything of it. I figured that it was a one time and therefore it wasn’t a big deal. It was a Cuban and I saw it as a special occasion. However, the last few weeks I have resorted to smoking Swisher Sweets Cigarillos 3x a week. I still haven’t had a cigarette, but I still feel like I have actually cheated. 

Should I restart my Smoke Free App Timer?

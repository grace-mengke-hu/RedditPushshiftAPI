will it pass?

so i quit smoking cold turkey exactly 2 month ago after being a pack a day smoker for ~8 years. the first few weeks were hardest, though not nearly as hard as i thought they'd be. i thought the urge would get less and less and eventually disappear if only i would make it there. well, it's been 2 month now and i start to wonder if it will truly ever disappear. there are situations where normally i'd be perfectly satisfied but now it feels like there is missing something. i think about smoking often, and for much more than just 5 minutes or so. will there ever be a time where i really don't want a cigarette? will there ever be a time where i can enjoy those moments i accociate with a cigarette as much as i did before? will there every be time where it doesn't feel like i have to restrain myself? will my life be as safisfactory as it was before? i can make it through today, i can make it through this week and i can make it through this month with the nagging feeling that there is something missing and the occasional urge to smoke, but i can't make it my whole life. or better yet i won't. i rather pay with my health and a few years of my life than feel miserable forever.

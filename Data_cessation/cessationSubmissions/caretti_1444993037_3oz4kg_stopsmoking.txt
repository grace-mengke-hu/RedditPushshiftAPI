When is a quit attempt a failed quit attempt?

I'm interested to know what you guys think. If you have one cigarette,  do you reset and start again? What about 5? I reset my badge here but haven't done so on my app. I figured I still got those health benefits, I still didn't smoke those 500+ cigarettes but I've got the feeling I'm somehow cheating.  It made me think,  psychologically,  what's the best way to think about having a cigarette if you have done that? It's a tiny blip and you ignore or you start from scratch? Any thoughts appreciated.

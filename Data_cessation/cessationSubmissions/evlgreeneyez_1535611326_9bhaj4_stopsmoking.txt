Tell me why you’re quitting!

I’m at work. I have about 5 and a half hours left in my shift. Never mind that I have been a week smoke free, I would happily strangle someone for a cigarette right now. And I’ve got it in my head that I’m going to buy a pack when I get off.

Inspire me, motivate me, educate and awe me. Tell me your reasons for quitting. Please!

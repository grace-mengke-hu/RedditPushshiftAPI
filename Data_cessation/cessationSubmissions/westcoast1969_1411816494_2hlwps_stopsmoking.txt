Day 6 and feeling good

Today's my birthday and I've just realised this is the first birthday I've been smoke free since I was 16. Not going to tell you how old I am - but am old enough to know better!! So I am not going out to celebrate my birthday today as I know I'll be tempted. Instead having a quiet night in and will celebrate my birthday in a couple of weeks when I know I'll be able to cope with any cravings and temptations.

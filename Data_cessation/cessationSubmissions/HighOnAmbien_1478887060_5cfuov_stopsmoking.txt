Cigarette addiction or nicotine?

I've tried quitting multiple times before, often successful for months, or a year at a time, but I can't figure something out.  When I quit smoking, I start craving, but I don't experience any other withdrawl symptoms.  It feels like an intense food craving, like I would really like one, but I don't feel like I have to have one.

I have a vape with 12mg of nicotine, which I can use all day long and the cravings never go away.  If I was addicted to nicotine, why wouldn't this help?  If I am trying to quit and craving very bad, just knowing that I can buy a pack anytime makes the feeling go away.  Usually for a few weeks/months, until I smell someone smoking, then I start craving again.  So I try the vape to help relieve the craving, but it never helps.

I feel like I am more addicted to the actual smoking of a cigarette rather than the nicotine.  I've tried vape, patches, gums, nothing helps other than having a cigarette.

What kind of addiction is this?  Is it mental, because it sure feels like it.  It doesn't feel physical at all.  Is it possible to be mentally addicted without being physically addicted?

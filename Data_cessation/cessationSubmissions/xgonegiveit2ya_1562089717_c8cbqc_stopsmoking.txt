Today is the day that I noticed my sense of smell back

I've been nicotine free since late March (Yaaaaaaaaay) and today I sat down close to a guy that is a smoker, and holy shit was the smell unpleasant! I couldn't help but think that "wtf! Is that what I smelled like to people?!?!". I kinda felt ashamed and thought that maybe I should go apologize to anybody I had put through the ordeal of smelling me hahaha.

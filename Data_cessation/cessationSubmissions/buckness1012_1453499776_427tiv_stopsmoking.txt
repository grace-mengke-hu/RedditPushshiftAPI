5 days, my thoughts.

For the first time in a long while, I've gone 5 days without a single cigarette. Not even a puff. I've been reflecting on the process so far, and I could use some advice for the future. I also have some thoughts that may help people who are also trying to quit.

I have a very addictive personality. For the past 9 years, I have used substances from nicotine to adderall to cocaine in copious amounts to try and shield myself from facing the ups and downs of life. All it has served to do is limit my personal growth. 

The last beast I have left to tackle is cigarettes. And it's been 5 days solid. 

You can do anything! You can completely change your life. All it takes is the thought in your head that you want to live better. Healthier. Just commit. Don't allow yourself any breaks. The challenge makes you stronger.

In my opinion, someone who has conquered any kind of personal demon is stronger for the experience, compared to if they had not had the addiction in the first place.

You already have the addiction, now quit and build your willpower on top of it.

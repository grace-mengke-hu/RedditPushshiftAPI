Just finished a pack. Hopefully finished for good. I don't know if I can do this.

I want to quit so bad. I want to be the healthy happy daughter my mom so desperately needs. I do not want to succumb to the family tradition of addiction. But I also just had the last ciggarette in my pack and so desperately want to go out and buy another. 

I'm 18. I've been smoking for 8 months now at about a pack every two days. I don't even know how I got into it or how it got so bad. I also smoke weed on a regular basis and want to quit that as well.

But quitting is the most frightening thing in the world. I tried quitting weed and gave up after two and a half weeks. I imagine quitting ciggarettes will only be worse. I love my ten minute breaks with a ciggarette between my fingers. I can't imagine going without. 

Maybe someone has some words of wisdom? Something that can help me through this? Because I don't know if I can do it alone.

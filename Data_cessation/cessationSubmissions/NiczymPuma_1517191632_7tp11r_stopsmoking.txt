Starting right now!

The time is passing by and I want to change my life an become a non-smoker, have a better life. **Cigarettes** **are** prolly **the** **worst** **thing** that's happening in my life (in a long-term), so why shouldnt I start by removing them?

*I smoked for 6 to 7 years, at the start my addiction were not so advanced and i smoked ociassionally with friends. Now, Im smoking every 15 minutes if i get really bored and have nothing to do. Im really hard addicted to nicotine and smoking is almost always the first thing that comes to my mind when waking up. I  know how to fight and overcome most of addictions, but Im really weak at this moment. I have had some bad experiences and im feeling like a wreck even though from others perspective it should be okay. Instead of filling my lungs with that disgusting poison I'll fill my time with jogging and working on my body. I do not want to just sit down by the computer and hope i will not smoke, that's why i give up unhealthy smoking to a healthy habit that is working out.* 

* Stay strong guys, the thing Im really failing at are the simpliest triggers like a friend or a nice girl offering a smoke or being bored. I should start that mindfullnes thing but I totally have no idea what's it. 

* I have read Allen's Carr and It helped me for some weeks, already forgot most of It and looking forward to read it again. Any articles/videos/books/stories to check out when i get back home from my daily activities?

I just posted a few days ago, but today was the first day I woke up and felt GREAT!

I was truly starting to wonder if I just wasn't going to notice a difference other than mentally. But this morning when I woke up for work I took a deep breath and I really felt like my lung capacity had improved.


Just really wanted to share. Get used to me posting here cause I'm loving all of this :D

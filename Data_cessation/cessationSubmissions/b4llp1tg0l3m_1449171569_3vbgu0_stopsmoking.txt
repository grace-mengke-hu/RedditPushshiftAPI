3 days in, something that's helped me

Hey all, just found this sub a minute ago, probably going to frequent it for a bit. Three days of no nicotine and a weird thing has helped. I have in my car right now, one cigarette and a lighter. It's always there. I know its there, and I'm allowed to smoke it whenever. The part of me that actively chooses to not smoke it feels pretty incredible. It helps me realize that smoking is always my choice and I can choose to stop.

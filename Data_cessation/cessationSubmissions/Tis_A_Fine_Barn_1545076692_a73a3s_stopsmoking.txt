Something I didn't expect: I experience some anxiety at gas stations. I've filled up a few times now, and when I'm at the gas pump my inner monologue is like "Don't go in. Don't go in. Don't go in." It's just a gas station, inner voice. Shut up, I'm fine. Presenting #035 Clefairy. See you tomorrow.

reflection on day 1

i just finished day 1 and i am on the morning of day 2. yesterday was fucking excruciating. the entire day i felt so empty and spaced out. i kept running around, cleaning my room, washing dishes, meal prepping, and eventually just pacing back and forth while i watched tv. at one point my stomach started to hurt, but i dont know if thats because smoking threw off when i usually eat or because of the not smoking.   
  
a little while ago i bought a vape with 2 mg nicotine in it that i decided im going to use as a fall back. at around 3 or 4 pm i couldnt take it, i was about to walk around and see if i could bum a smoke off someone on a walk, or just go to the store and buy some. i smoked on my vape for maybe two minutes just to take that edge off.  
  
today is day 2, gonna hit the gym and meal prep some more to take my mind off of smoking. maybe hitting the gym will discourage me from smoking because i dont want undo that work. also gonna out that vape in a drawer and not touch it, but i feel today is going to be much easier than yesterday.

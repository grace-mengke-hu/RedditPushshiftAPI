A New Direction, A New Me (Day 1)

The last time (of many trials and tribulations) I succeeded for 2 months but now after some realisations I've had over the past couple of days I'm making a commitment now to devote myself mind, body, and soul to quit smoking for good. The longest I've been free of my addiction was 7 months and I want to finally reach the one year and beyond markers. Tonight I realised that I was smoking a pack every 24hrs; that smoking was clearly a reason for my breakouts of cystic acne; that I have gotten to a point where I find random lighters in my bed when I go down for sleep; that I could buy two packs at once and NOT REMEMBER smoking an entire pack when I suddenly finish the second; that not just my attire but my water bottle smells of the smoke; and that I'm spending hard earned money on something I do not want to be chained to any longer. Not to mention the waste of my expensive perfumes I use to try cloaking the smell. I am finally taking my life back and banishing such a physically, mentally, and financially destructive monster from my life.

This is especially significant to me as I've become a rep for MaryKay cosmetics and the last thing I want to do is represent a make up brand by popping around to hold parties in people's homes reeking of smoke or trying to find an excuse to step outside and light one up. I'm going to my first meeting tomorrow (Tuesday) and I want to walk in there knowing I'm a person they can all rely on to uphold the company name in all my interactions.

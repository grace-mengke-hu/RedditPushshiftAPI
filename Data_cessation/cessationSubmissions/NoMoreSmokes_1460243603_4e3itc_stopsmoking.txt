Looking for advice on fighting cravings

So I've had many "last ones" as I'm sure you all understand. My most recent coming on Thursday. I want this to stick but I'm afraid of what has happened to me in the past. I just get cravings that come over me and they're hard to fight in the moment. My mind makes unreasonable rationalizations about why one more is okay. It's always just one more and the craving just lingers for so long. So my question is, how do you guys successfully fight those moments? What do you do in that moment to resist? Thanks for any help! 

Also, I'm new here so if I broke some guidelines with this post, I'd love to know what I did and how to fix it for future posts!

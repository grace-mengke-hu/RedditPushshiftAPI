Another close call

I almost smoked a cigarette after my friend left his pack outside. It was so late that it was early, and I was falling down drunk. I took a cigarette out and ready to light it with that excited anticipation. I put the cigarette to my lips.

Had to freeze for a bit and really think it over. Imagining myself following through, I didn't feel fearful about it, but resigned towards the whole act. Despite my feelings giving me the all-clear I had to stop myself. It felt a bit like betrayal, and today has been unforgiving as a reward.

I'm doing the work to be strong enough, and all the while trying to figure out where that strength is coming from. The people around me are throwing me their own challenges, and me searching for a way to escape is so ingrained in who I am. I'm angry that it has to be like this. Is this what self control is?

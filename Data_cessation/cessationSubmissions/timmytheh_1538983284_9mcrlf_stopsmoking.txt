One week without vaping!

I decided to quit vaping cold turkey a week ago when I moved to Japan for my studies. I'm still getting over some humps but I'm doing a lot to occupy myself and not think about vaping. I'll be home in two months for the holidays, and hopefully will not pick it back up again.

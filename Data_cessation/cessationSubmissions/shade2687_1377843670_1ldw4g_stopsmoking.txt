My experience quitting thus far.

**A bit of background**: I've been smoking since I was 19 and I'm just about to turn 26, so I've been smoking for ~7 years. For the past ~3 of those years, I've been smoking a pack a day, and on some occasions more. I know that sometimes when I've been drunk, I've smoked 2 packs in a night. Jesus. Scares me to think about. Oh yea, I also have had mild asthma since I was 10 years old.

Well, it's been one week now and I'd like to talk with all of you about what the experience has been like for me personally. I hope this doesn't seem selfish. 

**What I did:** I know that this subreddit tends to favor Allen Carr's book and method over patches, gums, acupuncture, etc. Well, I read Allen Carr's book, thought it was interesting, but I also found it to be a bit corny. Perhaps I also wasn't ready at the time, but I attempted to quit after reading his book and the method didn't do the trick for me. This time, the thing which I was (and still am, to a certain extent) skeptic of was what worked for me: hypnosis. I listened to some hypnosis program. Perhaps it was was placebo. Perhaps I was already genuinely fed up with smoking and really wanted to quit this time. Perhaps the fact that I was winded after walking up a short hill did it. I'm not entirely sure, but this time it's working, and it's working well.

**How I've been feeling:** The first 48-72 hours were difficult, but I was surprised by how insignificant my cravings were in comparison to how I remembered them, or perhaps how my body/mind influenced me to feel about quitting due to my dependence on nicotine. While I still tend to feel cravings in the morning, they aren't very influential and I'm more excited about the prospect of preparing myself a wonderful breakfast (which I never ate while I was a smoker) than smoking. It just doesn't seem important to me anymore.

What I'm noticing, however, are massive quality of life improvements in my everyday life. Due to the fact that I'm asthmatic, smoking obviously exacerbated my already struggling lungs' problems. I can walk up those hills now without any problems. I don't wake up in the middle of the night needing to use my inhaler. I can wake up so much easier in the morning. Food actually appeals to me. I feel more energetic. I'm going to sign back up at the gym this weekend. Oh yea, and even though a lot of smokers think they won't be able to handle stress when they quit, I'm actually much less stressed out. I can unequivocally say that I'm the happiest I've been in a long time.

**Things to keep in mind:** If you're thinking about quitting or have recently quit but are struggling, I would encourage you to think about the small improvements in the beginning. Being able to take a deep, full breath and let it go is an amazing feeling. Knowing that you could go with your friends on a hike and not being the one who has to stop to catch his/her breath all the time is an amazing feeling. Realizing that by quitting, you are an inspiration to others who want to do the same is an amazing feeling. Demonstrating to yourself that you can set goals and achieve them is one of the best feelings you could ever have. 

So, try it out.

Day got worse...still not smoking

Update (next morning) - day kept getting worse...and DID NOT smoke!!! It got tough going for a while...but I'm at 11 days yo!!!  Thanks for all support - it really made a difference yesterday.

Original post (Wednesday afternoon):
Expected today to be difficult to not smoke. Got worse when husband decided to start latest alcohol binge today.  So upset and mad that I decided I would NOT smoke - just as a overall fuck you to everything including shitty things.

Im not worrying nor deciding what I'll do later after work about smoking. One day at a time is too much for me now...breaking today into smaller chunks.  Later is too big and unknown to worry about.

Right now...I am NOT smoking, and I'm proud of this.

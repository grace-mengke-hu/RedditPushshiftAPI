Which one was "that" moment for you?

Mine happened today when my girlfriend told me that "hah, we all know that you can't quit". This sentence made me angry (because it might be true, since I had so many unsuccessful attempts at this), but it gave me so much motivation to prove her wrong.

I can do this.

when does the severe anxiety go away?

Had to miss work for a few days due to the severe anxiety. I've quit cold turkey for 10 days so far. Going to therapy now and the only thing the helps is kolonopin, has anyone here been in the same boat and can shed so advice?

How long does it take till the severe anxiety passes?

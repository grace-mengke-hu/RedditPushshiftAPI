Need to quit

I haaaated cigs as a kid. Picked em up while I drank in my 20s. 

Recently went through two horribly stressful situations and told myself, while basically chain smoking for two months, that I'll stop when this all passes.

All has passed and I need to stop now. Just had one a few minutes ago, and Im just so disgusted with myself.

The nicotine pull is real. 

Time to stop. I have to stop.

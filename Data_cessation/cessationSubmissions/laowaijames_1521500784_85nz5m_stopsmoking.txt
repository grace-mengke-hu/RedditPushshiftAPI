Quit for a month during winter vacation...back at school, immediately relapsed.

Hey guys new to this sub,

I’ve been an on and off smoker since I was 16 (now 26), I recently got married and my wife (also an ex smoker although with much more willpower than me apparently) encouraged me to quit because we want to have kids.

The past two years have been my heaviest years, smoking 20 a day on average. I’m a high school teacher, and I also do a full load of tutoring outside school. I live in China where smoking is especially common (2 in 3 men) and cigarettes are also very cheap. Over the winter vacation/Chinese new year I managed to quit cold turkey, but now I’m back at work after a month off I relapsed very quickly due to just being tired and stressed and I guess, if I’m honest, force of habit. 

A typical day for me starts at 5am when I wake up, I leave for work at 5.30 to catch the early metro to work whilst it’s quiet, I get to school at about 7am and classes start at 7:55. Three evenings a week I have tutoring classes and my Saturday and Sunday are also full of tutoring classes, safe to say I have a really full on schedule without much downtime. 

I’m four weeks back into the semester, and yesterday I smoked 10. I really want to quit, having relapsed I don’t enjoy smoking anymore because I feel guilty (my wife thinks I’m still on the wagon) but I also feel helpless to quit. 

I’d love to hear any advice that you have to help get me back on track and get me back to where I need to be.

I slipped up on the 17th.

I had a smoke on the 17th after I got the news from my Doctor.



I reset my badge, I felt like I was cheating, especially since my body hadn't been clean from the chemicals since the 9th...



I haven't had one since, though, so I've been clean for 8 days and still going strong :)

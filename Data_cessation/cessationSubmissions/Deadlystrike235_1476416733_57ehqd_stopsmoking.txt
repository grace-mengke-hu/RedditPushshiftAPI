I did it cold turkey.

About two years ago on september 19th 2014, i woke up to several snap chats from my friends of them making fun of me the night before. For some reason, it pissed me off in an unusual way. Theres aggitated. Theres angry, hell theres even yelling. But this new level of mad. It was scary. I kept thinking to myself, "life in prison doesnt sound bad compared to the world i'm living in." And for some reason, that was the day i just quit. I used that anger to pull me through the hardest points and all my withdrawals. 

I relapsed because, hell i aint got a good reason.

All I can say is. Fond something that can fuel you the way it did me. And the only reason i relapsed was cause i had given up on my will to stay healthy. 

Now when people ask how im doing. I say "Im still alive." I dont know for how much longer.

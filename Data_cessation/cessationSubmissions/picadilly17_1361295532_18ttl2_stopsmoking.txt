I'm doing it this time! 

So, I have never considered myself an actual smoker... I always thought of myself more of a social smoker. I can go days without a smoke sometimes, but then there are other days I have a super big urge to smoke one. But, with some recent changes in my life (moved to CO) and no longer working at a bar that allowed smoking, I think it's time I give these damn things up for good. I had my last smoke last night, and am starting with a clean slate today. As George Michael would say "gotta have faith!" Good luck to all others out there trying to quit!!

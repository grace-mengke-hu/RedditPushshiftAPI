1 Month Down, Going Strong!

Finally did it, stopped cold turkey. My last smoke was on June 29th. Just decided I didn't want to buy them any more. It only took me 15 years, but I feel much better off now because of it! 

Re-reading that statement makes it sound so much easier than it actually was, though. I think this is my fourth attempt, but prior to this I'd never made it beyond 2 weeks.

I'm not sure what changed, but I was finally able to declare to myself that I'm done, they do nothing but make me tired and feel like shit, and I'm literally paying for those terrible feelings.

Anyway, stay strong to others who are working to quit! Never give up, and don't get discouraged from slipping up or suffering from temporary setbacks.

A question for you now ex smokers: How do you physically feel now?

I'm getting tired of smoking. I smoke a pack and a half of Parliament Ultra Lights daily and I'm getting sick of not breathing well, smelling, horrible breath, losing money, being winded by trivial tasks and feeling like I'm 70. I'm 28.

I'm getting ready to finally quit and to help my motivation, how do you feel? When did it start to feel better? 

I have tried before but constantly fail. I want to kick this habit finally.

Edit: Do you also feel less stiff? As in more relaxed muscles? Whenever I smoke after a break my muscles stiffen and I have to crack or pop my back more.

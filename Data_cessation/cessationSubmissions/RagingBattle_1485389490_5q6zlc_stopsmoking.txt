Relapsed yesterday

Ok, I know I've been a bad guy, don't look me like that.

The fact is that my life is falling apart, yesterday I literally cried in my shower, just like you see in the movies, the only difference is that there wasn't any depressed song playing in background.
I smoked on purpose, not because I was craving to smoke. I thought it would have helped me (didn't happen of course). Today I smoked maybe...five cigarettes, because I wanted to, but my body is fighting like hell to stop me. I just don't like to smoke anymore. Right now I can feel what causes to my body and senses, rather than just be a slave and crave for the next one. It's like now doesn't affect anymore my work/prize model, I just see that it accelerate my bpm, tie my stomach in knots and make me anxious, and it's not the kind of anxiety that a puff will calm down.

I feel like I gained control.

Re-quitting. Day 1 again and for the last time

I never smoked much, for four years I've smoked maybe 1 or 2 cigs a day, sometimes none. What's funny is most of the time after I smoke, I feel gross and swear I'm going to quit. I don't think I'm even addicted to it, it's just _something_ to do during work breaks. 

I've tried to quit numerous times, was on a 6 day strike until a friend handed me one yesterday. I'm under a lot of stress from my family so I took one. I wasn't going to reset the clock but I want to take responsibility for my actions.

Day 1, here we go.

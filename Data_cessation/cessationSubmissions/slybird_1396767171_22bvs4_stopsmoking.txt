93 days cold turkey, having a hard time tonight.

There is nothing you can say to help, mostly just venting. Tonight I am having a harder time than normal. Store is a five minute walk away as always. I will not smoke tonight, but for the last hours I have been thinking of them almost every half hour. My mind is having the split voices. Bed soon and 94 days tomorrow.

Over a month down.

Some things I've utilized to make it easier:

- outsmarting my cravings using mindfulness meditation

- when I was feeling strong against my cravings, I would pick up random packs of cigarettes from friends, practice saying no to the pack, putting a cigarette in mouth, taking it out, snapping it in half occasionally if someone was being a jerk and taunting me, putting the pack down, making fun of it, being aware of what it is and re-labelling it to it's true nature (poison, toxic, etc.), etc.
- drinking lots of water

- exercise daily in any form I can get it (jogging/running, walking, bicycling, push-ups, lifting, etc.)

- reading/distracting myself

- managing my HALT symptoms (Hunger, Anger, Loneliness, Tired)


I've been here a couple of times before. The realization that I was using nicotine and smoking to distract me from my own horrible negative thoughts and anxiety/depression has helped. I've taken a lot of steps to manage my root issues (finally admitting I have anxiety/depression is a big one.)

When I'm around smokers, I walk away from them often. I ask people to not smoke with me in their car when they're driving me places. If they can't do that, then I tell them I'm not coming with them because I've smoked enough in my life where I feel I deserve some clean air for a change.

Might sound self-righteous. I don't care though. I've had too many relapses in my life while trying to quit to give a shit about what anyone else thinks at this point. If they can't respect my choices, they're not worth my time!

Ah, this feels good. Time to keep going!

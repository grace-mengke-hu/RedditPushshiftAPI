Feeling Empty?

I'm on day 15 of not smoking. I don't work today. Got a few things done now I have a bunch of time on my hands. Nothing to do. It's a weekday and everyone I know is at work. I'm just feeling empty. Like there is no point to anything. I feel rediculously restless but I have nothing to do with my time.

It's really causing me to crave smoking.

I feel so restless and like I'm in a bit of mental pain and just want to scream.

If I could do what I wanted to without consequence I would just start breaking everything around me and screaming...like throw the tv through the window lol.

I hate feeling off like this.

I basically feel empty like nothing I do is fulfilling.

I feel restless.

I feel so irritable I'm worried the slightest thing will make me lose it.

I suspect this is just another withdrawal thing. And it will pass. But it's hard to exist like this.

After 24 days I've gained some good and some vad

I'm going to try my best but I'm on mobile so sorry if its a wall of text.

  About an hour ago I got really frustrated and instead of having that little internal debate on if I want to smoke or not I just took a deep breath and that was it so that's a big plus for me. 
  Anyway ill start with the bad:
• Since I quit my sleep pattern has gotten continually worse and as of now I can only sleep a max of 4 hours a day
• The lack of sleep is not helping with my preexisting depression
• If I do manage to sleep I have a bloody taste in my mouth when I wake up. 

   The pros are a lot better than the cons and that's the only reason I'm sticking with this: no particular order
• I don't get winded walking a flight of stairs
• No more random chest tightness and pains
• No more yellow fingers or bad smelling clothes
• I can sit through a movie and go to a restaurant without getting up to smoke
• Money has appeared out of no where
• Things taste and smell better (things I disliked now taste worst)
• Skin color has improved 
   There's so much I could write and I'm happy I finally stuck with something.

17 years old, 5 year smoker. I'm pissed at myself and finally doing something about it.

I've smoked since I was twelve years old, which is just fucking pathetic. I am a reasonably fit kid, I've taken tae kwon do for nine years, and I'm the VP of the ultimate frisbee club at my school. Now I'm suddenly finding myself short of breath very often, along with wheezing, and I'm even getting chest pains. The fact that I even have to worry about lung cancer at 17 is just so fucking infuriating to me. I don't know why exactly it happened, but I just ripped apart the last of my cigs, and I've never felt more motivated than now. I'm just so fucking pissed at myself for even letting myself get addicted. 

So today, I'm finally doing it. I'm done with these little shits. I don't want cancer before I'm even an adult. Fuck this.

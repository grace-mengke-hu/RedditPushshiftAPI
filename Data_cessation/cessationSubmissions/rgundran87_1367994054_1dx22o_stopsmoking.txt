So it's been a little over 24 hours since I had my last cigarette...

And I feel like absolute death already. Like a don't feel like a living person, I feel like a zombie just shuffling around the house with no idea what I should be doing. Add to that I have an extreme headache. I dont know what to do. It's been one day :(

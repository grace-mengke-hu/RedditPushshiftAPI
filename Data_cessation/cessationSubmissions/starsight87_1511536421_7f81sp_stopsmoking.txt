Day 6 - Almost one week under my belt

Today was tough, 

I woke up in a fog and was almost immediately switch hitting between irritable and depressed. The flood of dialogue in my head was pointing towards "Your brother is just a call away, ask for a smoke" and then I stopped to breath. I did nothing else for two or three minutes and then a thought crossed me "How does he feel each and every time I do this to him?". My bro would accept me if I smoked or didn't but I put him in a situation where I constantly ask him to help me fail at a goal I set. It just didn't seem fair and after a quick moment of guilt I just went to visit him. 

I've written a lot over the last few days about how my credibility has been hurt when saying I want to quit smoking. I want to rebuild that integrity and sense of ownership over my goals by following this through. It requires me to ask why people lost faith in the seriousness of my actions. So far it has led me to some great insights about how I smoke and the harm that it causes.

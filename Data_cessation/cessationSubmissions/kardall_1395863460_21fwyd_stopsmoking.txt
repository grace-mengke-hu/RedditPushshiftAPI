Almost 145 days, and a few insights and reflections

So looking back I thought I would share some of the thing that have helped me over the last month or so.

First off, keep yourself occupied with something that you wouldn't normally do. For example, I am a gamer, and I have been trying to take on new hobbies to find something that I get enjoyment out of that I had never done before. Doing so has avoided a few cravings so I was not being bombarded with triggers as much.

Second, talk about it with people. Reddit is great, but mention it from time to time and people will give you 'good luck' and 'best wishes' which seem to help boost my energy of wanting to continue not smoking.

Third, take the advice that I took about 20-30 days in. Do not avoid triggers. Things you do on a regular basis that you used to smoke, are big ones. Drinking, partying, going out to clubs, hangout on the back loading dock during breaks. It's all good to do these things, but resisting the urge is difficult until you actually face it. If you try to delay it, you will probably end up doing a bunch of them all together, and it will be that much harder to overcome. Try to spread them out depending on how much you think you can handle.

For me, I put off driving long distances as much as possible. I started taking longer and longer drives, and eventually last Christmas I had to do a 9.5 hour drive to my parents place and back. I made it, and I know i'll have urges, but they will be no where near what I had encountered during that trip. It was really difficult but I did it! You can too!

Problems I have had lately, are going out with friends who don't smoke, and we come to say a mall, and the smokers are outside. Walking past them is difficult still, I don't think that will ever go away. Or seeing halfies on the ground, that sucks.

But day by day, I keep chuggin along. :D

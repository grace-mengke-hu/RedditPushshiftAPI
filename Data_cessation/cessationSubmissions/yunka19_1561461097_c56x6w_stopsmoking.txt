Relapse after an year

Had a bad habit of smoking which ruined my relationship after she left me i was able to stop smoking and get a lot better but after a year my cat of five years died and i had a hard time so started smoking again i feel like i want to quit but it seems that everytime i try i just cant. last time i quit cold turkey but i dont seem to have the will power now and it scares me.

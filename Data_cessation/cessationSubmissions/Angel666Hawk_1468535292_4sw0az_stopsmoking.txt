And this is how you become a smoker...

I'm from r/stopdrinking. I've been sober for 7 months. I still get anxious and an urge to get buzzed. I have recently turned to cigarettes. For some reason nicotine is tolerated and excused from sobriety. I'd rather not smoke but even the little 5 minute nicotine buzz is some form of relief. I am turning to r/stopsmoking before this becomes yet another unhealthy habit. I just don't know what to do with that urge. I always seem to turn to something self destructive. Ideas/tips?

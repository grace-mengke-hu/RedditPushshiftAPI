Going to the bathroom after you quit.

After I stopped smoking for few days, I am had problems pooping(not sure how to write it more gently). I don't experience any pains, but going to the loo is a bit harder and generally I feel more swollen. 
Do any of you have experienced this and how did you deal with it?

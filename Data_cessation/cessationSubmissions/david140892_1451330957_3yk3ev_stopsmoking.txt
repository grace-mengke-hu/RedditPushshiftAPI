I quit smoking today for the second time in my life

Hi everyone, 

I started smoking again after almost a year after i quit smoking for the first time because my girlfriend and I broke up. She was the reason and my motivation for quitting, and as we broke up the old craving for cigarettes came back. Now after almost two months of smoking I want to stop again. Please help me find the right motivation for living a smoke free life.

Thanks!

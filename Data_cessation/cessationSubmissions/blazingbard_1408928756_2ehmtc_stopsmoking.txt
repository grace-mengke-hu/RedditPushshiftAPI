1 week down

Well 1 week and 2 days. The day I found this sub I quit cold turkey. Those first few days I lived here, as time keeps going and I move further and further away from my old smoker self I find the need or desire to smoke begun to fade away.

Day 1 and 3 I was a basket case. Now day 9 I only feel a flash, maybe an impulse a ghost of what I used to do and it feels awesome. 
13 year smoker and if I can do it so can you.
Ps. I love you guys my favorite sub to be.
And to you lurkers out there, stay strong you'll beat that darn addiction just let it go.

Day 1

Day 1 to quit smoking. I'm tired of it ruining my life. I have created a list of reasons why I am quitting smoking and have made them my homescreen on my phone. I have also told a few friends that I am finally kicking this horrible habit. I have downloaded the quitnow app to help remind me why I am making this decision. Wish me luck.

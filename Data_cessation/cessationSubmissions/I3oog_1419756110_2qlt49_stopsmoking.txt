My first real success quitting.

So this is the third time I have attempted to quit this year, hence the 300ish days flair (it was at the beginning of the year). Over the summer I made it three weeks, and then relapsed during the fall semester of school. It was a pretty stressful time as it was my last full semester before finishing both my majors.

The very last day of this semester I promised myself and my girlfriend that I would quit smoking, and believe it or not I have actually stuck to it. I know it has only been 8 days so far, but I feel much more confident about it than I did during my quit over the summer. This last night I even got pretty drunk at a concert and turned down a lot of free cigarettes even while I was drinking.

I don't think I would have been able to do this without the help of the subreddit honestly, and I wanted to thank you guys for your support. Here's to a more healthy and financially stable life!

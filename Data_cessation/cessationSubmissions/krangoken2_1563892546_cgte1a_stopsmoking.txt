I'm 40 hours into quitting and already feeling better

I've attempted many times before, but I feel like this is the one.  I'm trying to be more involved in this community and with the app right now

I woke up this morning and I wasn't coughing or wheezing.  I ran across the street to make it before the light changed and didn't feel out of breath.  I didn't have to stop for cigarettes on my way to work so I made it on time.  I saved $6.50 today by not buying a pack.  

I feel great and I can't wait to keep this going!  I'm getting some cravings here and there but overall I'm excited that I won't have to smoke anymore.  Thanks for reading and thanks for the support!

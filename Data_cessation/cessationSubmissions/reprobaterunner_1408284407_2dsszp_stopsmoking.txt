One week down - advice to stay stopped when alcohol is involved?

I have made it to day seven! Hurray! However I have also spent a week completely sober. I always get the urge to smoke when I am drinking (which I will be doing next weekend), it my biggest weakness when it comes to not lighting up. 

How have others managed to combat this? Any advice?

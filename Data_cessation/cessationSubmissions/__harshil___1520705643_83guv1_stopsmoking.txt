42 days and still counting!

Been a smoker for a long time, I have no urge to smoke anymore. I had some of the worst days in-between, but did not opt for smoking. 

I think it works best if you ditch the concept of the final cigarette, wake up one morning and decide that cigarette previous night was the last one.

196 days in, cold turkey 2+packs/day +my crazy

I've tried to quit dozens of times, but even when I had pneumonia I was still smoking. 
I was a little over 2 packs a day for 10 years. 
Smoking in front of the bar one sunday night, I looked at a friend of mine and asked her "am I done with this cigarette?" she said "you've got about half left" I yelled "WRONG" chucked my pack and my lighter and went back inside to drink.
That rest of that night was easy. 
The next morning I was still good, I wanted a smoke, but it was easy enough to distract myself with puzzles and dragons on my phone. 
Day 2 I spent all 74 thousand hours between waking up and noon wondering when the cravings would stop. Then I got handed a copy of alan carr's easy way. I figured I was already quit, but I started to read the book. Day 3 I woke up, rubbed one out, and came so hard that I knew I would never smoke again. 
Then on week 4 I started to feel really thick, couldn't concentrate, couldn't sleep more then 3 or 4 minutes without waking up in a panic, and my mood started to get real dark. Week 5 I went to my Dr's office, he told me that after "years of deadening your brain with cigarettes, your starting to balance those chemicals out, go see a therapist." 
By the end of week 7 I felt the best I ever have in my life.
Now 196 days in it boggles my mind how much time and money I wasted smoking! When my old cigarette budget is now my new truck budget (2015 4x4 crew cab 1500!) its easy to stay quit. 

tl;dr
    it sucks, then gets better, buy a new truck

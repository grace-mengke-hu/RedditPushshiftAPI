Thank you all. I'm one month free

Probably since the beginning of my reddit i have been watching this community be supportive to everyone trying to quit and everyone sharing their tips. I have tried to quit once before in august, but allowed myself the occasional puff which turned back to a pack a day.

Last month i went jogging and caught a cold. It felt like i was trying to cough my lungs out so a cigaret after wasn't really pleasant. a day went by without a smoke, then a week, than two weeks (i was still coughing really bad) and then the thought crosses my mind: I have quit, i only had to keep going.
Even though my boyfriend smokes inside it doesn't tempt me and studying without thinking when my next smoke break is made me feel more in controll of my time. I'm blabering.

Anyway, thank you everyone here that keep cheering on everyone for any mile stone that they reach. It helped motivate me.

p.s. english is not my first language

Help! My boyfriend is trying to quit and has gone one day so far

He decided last night he wanted to quit and hasn't smoked all today. He had a moment and went to the store to buy a bag of Tabacco. He hasn't opened it yet, it's in my purse now; He is getting really antsy he's told me and he just seems sad to me and he can't focus on any of his daily objectives. He just wants to sit there and watch whatever I'm doing, which I'm trying to be the best at entertaining. 
     Is it better to slow down how many he's having a day or do we keep going with quitting cold turkey ? I don't have much experience with nicotine addiction and any suggestions will help ! Thank you.

Medication, electronic cigarette, or both? I just want to break the addiction and quit.

I know that there is an addiction for me. I feel that genetic disposition to addiction (no specific to smoking) along with my own poor choices caused me to begin and continue to smoke.

However, I also feel that sometimes medication or alternate choices can play a huge roll in success. Medication because it can specifically targeted actual chemical alterations to aid in quitting and alternate choices like e-cigs.

I had a ' Blu  Starter Pack' and it worked to reduce my smoking 'real' smokes to ZERO for about two weeks. It didn't produce the amount of smoke I think would have left me satisfied (I prefer a thick smoke) and it just didn't feel like a real smoke did.

Today, I am ready to quit. I just wanted to find out experiences with medication such as Chantix or nicotine patches in combination with an e-cig. I have absolutely no money, and buy my smokes by doing bottle returns. It makes me feel almost pathetic. If I have a successful interview in the next few weeks, I plan to buy an e-cig. But for now, I am strongly considering talking to my doctor about medication.

I know everyone reacts different to medications and therapies, but what are some of the best ones that worked for you?

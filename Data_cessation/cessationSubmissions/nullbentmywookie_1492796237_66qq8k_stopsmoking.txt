Round 3.....fight! Hypnosis version

Ok, so I was here probably 2 years ago going cold turkey, did alright for about 2 months, things happened, I was again a smoker. Tomorrow night, I have an appointment with a highly recommended hypnotherapist. My pops quit with hypnotherapy after being a smoker for 40ish+ years and he's been free and clear for about 6 or 7 years now. He's excited for me and sent me the money for the session (because holy moly this is gonna be expensive!).


I am just so nervous. All I have to do is show up with my cigarettes. And I want this, I'm just scared I'm going to mess it up again.


I would love to hear some hypnosis success stories, things that helped you after the session, how the session itself went. I'm also training for my first 5k that happens in about 1.5 months, so I'm hoping I'll be able to just focus more on that to help me bide my time in the mornings (usually my worst time for chainsmoking). I'm concerned about work though, not a lot of other smokers on my shift or other shifts, but it definitely helps pass the time on slow days. Any tips for getting through those times? 


Also, I don't know if my badge says anything from my last attempt, I'm on mobile and don't see an option to change it, but if it says some insane amount of time it's lying. 

Edit, I found where to request to remove my badge so hopefully that happens soon.

It's been about 30 hours. May not seem like much, but I feel proud already.

This is the longest I've gone without a cigarette since I started smoking.  I'm feeling the cravings, but here's something I didn't know.

The craving isn't perpetual.  It hits, and and then it slowly fades away.  I thought I would just be stuck feeling like I needed a cigarette for weeks until I got used to not having one.

Well, here's to the future!  Now how do I change my flair!? (so happy to be able to do that now!)

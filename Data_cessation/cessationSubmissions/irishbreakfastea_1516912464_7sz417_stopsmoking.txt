slipped up twice after 8 days smoke free

I went 8 full days without smoking.  Two days ago I slipped up and bought a pack, and some beer (trying to quit booze too).  Smoked 12 cigarettes in one night.  The next morning I threw the rest out and said I'm done.  Well last night the same thing happened, urge hit, ran out and got beer and another pack.  Smoked almost the whole thing.  When I woke up today I threw away the three remaining cigs down the toilet.  

I'm so disappointed in myself.  I made it 8 days and now I feel like I went to all that work for nothing.  I'm craving a cigarette right now so bad.  I don't want to give up but damn.  This was so defeating guys.  A voice inside of me says "well you failed after all that work so might as well go back smoking" but the larger part of me does not want to give in to that voice.  I really want to quit and I think this is just the addiction talking.  Any advice?  Have any of you been in the same situation and how did you get out of it?

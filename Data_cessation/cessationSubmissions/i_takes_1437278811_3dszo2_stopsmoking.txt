Day 1 down!

Hey everyone! This is one of my first posts ever, and certainly my first post in this subreddit. I just heard about this subreddit yesterday when a friend referred it to me after I told him I was going to stop smoking as of yesterday evening.

A little bit about myself. I am 21, been a smoker for about 4 years. Within the past 3 years or so, I would smoke at least a half a pack a day. I initially started smoking when I was 17 out of curiosity. When I was 18, I got into a lot of trouble with the law with marijuana smoking (I live in the states), so in order to stay on the legal side of things and still smoke something, my cigarette habit really turned up a notch. For some reason, I felt the desire to still be able to smoke something, no matter what it was. 

Any who, I just completed a full 24 hours without a single cigarette. I am currently going cold turkey, but I don't know how long I will be able to keep that up. I was wondering, especially from former smokers (or anyone in the process of quitting for that matter), if you all had any advice for me? What worked for you guys and what really didn't? Is it normal to have an addiction to just smoking something in general.. and what could I do to stop it? If I still want to smoke, but not anything harmful or illegal, are their safe alternatives? Any help is appreciated!

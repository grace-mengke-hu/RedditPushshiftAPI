Why the fuck is day 7 so hard?

So last night I had a dream that I was working at a gas station selling cigarettes and then when I woke up this morning the first thing on my mind was wanting a smoke.  I have none in the house so that was not an issue and it is way to bloody cold here in Toronto to go out this weekend.  I have had more cravings this morning that I had for most of the week.  Is this normal or am I just going insane?

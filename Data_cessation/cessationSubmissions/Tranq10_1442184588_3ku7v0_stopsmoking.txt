It's been 47 days, 8 hours, 45 minutes and I'm craving

So, I quit smoking 47 days ago. But I haven't stopped this underying craving for a cig! It won't go. I haven't cracked (yet) I just don't know what to do. I feel better than ever health wise and I really don't want to smoke again because it's just so silly! Please any advise would really be appriciated right now.

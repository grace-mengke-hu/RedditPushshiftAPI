Tempted to start again...

Truth to be told, I loved smoking, enjoyed it after 1/2h of work or when simply walking to station, waiting for someone etc. 

I can't give you a reason why I quit, it started as a simple thing, like mhm, curios how long I can last without smoking, easily managed to one week, and that felt great, so I was mhm, I want another week, let's see, and so on...reached 7 months without a single smoke. 

Now, there are days when I really want to start again, but I think it would be like the first cigar ever, that was like 7-8 years ago, so I won't like it, and also feel like shit if I'll do it. Also, the sexual life was way way better than was when smoking, so that's a fucking big plus.

My first thread here, so uhm...anyone feel like this?

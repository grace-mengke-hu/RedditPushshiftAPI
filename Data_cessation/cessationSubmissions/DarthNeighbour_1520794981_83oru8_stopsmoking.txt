Hi i need some advice.

Im turning 25 and I've smoked since I was 15 years old. I always promised myself I'd quit by the time I turn 25, and it's good timing because recently I really am struggling to breath. Im just worried about the with withdrawal symptoms and is there and easier way to escape those symptoms or to ease them. For example switching to a lighter cigarettes? Or some other kind of trick or should I just suck it up and quit?

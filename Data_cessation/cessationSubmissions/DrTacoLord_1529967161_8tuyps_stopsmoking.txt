One day at the time

I want to breifly share with you that even that I been clean for almost 3 years, I still get cravings, I still want a cigarette sometimes at night.  I stay strong with a little mantra "Today I won't smoke"

I still find terrfying to think that I'd never smoke, but one day at the time has made it way easier for me, and for you it can be. 

Be strong, We are in this together. Just avoid it, one day at the time

Made it to 1 day

I'm so giddy right now. I really thought I was going to lose it a few minutes ago when my father came home and threw his smokes on the kitchen table where he normally puts them; I was standing in the kitchen making myself a cup of coffee when I spotted the pack in the corner of my eye and was so so close to just robbing one and sneaking out the back garden.

I just wanted to tell someone.

Day 15 is hard.

Hello. So I quit smoking April 9th after smoking roughly a pack a day for 15 years.  When I first quit, I was using the patch and vape. A few days ago I went off the patch and now I just vape about 5 times a day. I'm at a stand still. I don't know what to do. The vape juice I'm using has the nicotine equivalent of two cigs in 30mls. I use maybe 2mls every 3 days. It seems that's not a lot. I have vape juice that has no nicotine. I want to try using that instead. Has anyone quit with vaping? I'm afraid how I will react without any nicotine at all. Ugh.

secondary smoke caused nausea... now I realise what the fuss made by non-smokers was all about.

I think I have actually developed an allergy for smoke.  This will make it easier for me to stay on the straight and narrow.  I now see myself walking the whole wide world, window shopping at airports and so forth, meanwhile the smokers are confined to narrow spaces, or being miserable as they wait till the next place where they can light up.  It is as if there was a fog in front of my eyes, and that fog has cleared.  Now I see what I was missing.

I am drinking in the world with my eyes now.  And breathing deep, refreshing breaths.

I am having no regrets!  I dont miss it anymore.

First Christmas since I quit....having cravings

So I quit smoking last July. It's only been 5 months or so. And now I find myself craving cigarettes for the first time since like a month in. I think it's the holidays....ugh. Anyone else have the cravings return around a certain time of year? Did they go away afterwards? I'm finding myself thinking of just buying one pack and that's it but I know that is stupid because it won't end there...

Been lurking on here for about 1 week. Today is the day. I am quitting.

I am quitting smoking today. Been smoking for 13 years. Tried and failed to "cut down", tried and failed medication. 

No more. Turned 30 this year, I can't do this to myself anymore. Going cold turkey and have a ecig if I feel like I am going to loose it. But I have been through a lot over the past 2 years of my life that makes me think, If i got through that, then I can let go of my dependency of smoking.

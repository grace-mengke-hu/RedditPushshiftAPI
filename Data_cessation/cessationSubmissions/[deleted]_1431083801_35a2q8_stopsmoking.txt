Ive been where you're at.

Never look back at another cigarette again. I know how it feels having 1 days or 2 days on your badge but I promise it does get better. I havent smoked in several months and I bearly notice I ever smoked at all now. Sure I think about smoking every once in a while but I have zero physical addiction to ciggarettes any more. I save a ton of money and made my mother very proud of me. You wake up one day then you notice you are at 138 days with out a ciggarette. I would rather be a non smoker who thinks about cigarettes every once in a while then a smoker who thinks about quitting every day.

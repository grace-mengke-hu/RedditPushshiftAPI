How did you do it?

I want to stop. I've only been smoking just over 18 months but even the thought of stopping makes me want to smoke :/ Just wanted general advice. Did you go cold? I've heard having an e-cigarette helps break the routine your used to with smoking.

Any advice would be great, my girlfriend is home in 3 weeks from travelling and I'd love to be able to tell her I've stopped when she's home.

The stories here are brilliant.

Hard time

Everytime i quit smoking there is moments where i think that all my negative symptoms would be relieved if i just smoke one, and that going through all this compromise isn't worth it. I'm 2 days out and I'm already having second thoughts. Sharing this with you guys. Any advices or kind words ?

Journaling feels great. Thought I'd share my thoughts from today

I'm not one for New Year's resolutions, but I have 6 (5, oops) cigarettes left today and the timing lines up. I was writing my goals for 2019 &amp; it boils down to being consistent and forming good habits. I'm not going to be a smoker. Not tomorrow, not some days, not any days.

Sometimes I have to talk/yell at myself in writing to get my own message through. I can easily lie to myself, but it makes me feel more concerned for myself. I don't know 

&gt; Do ***NOT*** Smoke! Haven't we gone over this?
&gt; 
&gt; * How's your chest feel, buddy? Can you remember when it didn't feel so tight?
&gt; * I bet you cough ***every*** day (we can kill 2 birds with 1 stone here!)
&gt; * Food always looks so good! Remember when you could smell it too? Oh, it tastes like everything else..
&gt; * Wouldn't it be nice to get in your car and ***not*** choke?
&gt; * No one like getting colds! It's a shame you ***always*** feel that way 
&gt; * It sure is cold out. Remember when you were inside laughing with your friends/family?
&gt; * Making your head spin is the ultimate high! It's like being a kid again! /s
&gt; * Didn't you ~~cough~~ **HACK** up a rock this morning? That was cool, right?
&gt; * Don't try to tell me to recycle then litter as much as you do. One butt here &amp; there is okay cause you're spreading them out, yeah?
&gt; * You still hide it from your parents? &amp; people you first meet? Why don't you want to be ***you*** around them? 
&gt; * Speaking of Dad, don't you hold your breathe when you hug him? I bet people do it you, too.
&gt; * Remember how much you ~~hated~~ **HATED** when Mom &amp; Dad smoked in the car? You do that to your friends! 
&gt; * Surprise expenses suck, I know. But that's why you have savings! *Oh..* 
&gt; * You've been a non-smoker a few times now. Stop holding people up because you need to finish one. It's *annoying*
&gt; 
&gt; For fuck's sake. Quit while you're ahead. Your lungs still work enough. Why are you trying to see how much they can take?

I highly recommend writing. I was supposed to be busy but I got pulled in. Get your thoughts and feelings without influence of other people. Take the advice you'd give to who wrote it. I'm gonna go smoke a cigarette. 

Thanks for reading

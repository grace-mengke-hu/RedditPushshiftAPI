Just realized I've had a cigarette every day this week. Someone call me a twat please

I quit smoking almost a year ago. I've had a cigarette every now and then, when I'm out and drinking with friends or just on the back garden when the stars are out. I havent bought a pack just got one off my mother or my brother but I was having one earlier when i realized I'm not "just having one" I've actually just started smoking again. Fuck.

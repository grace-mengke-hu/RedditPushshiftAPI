Grateful To Say The Least

Rolling over 1000 days totally cigarette and nicotine free today. Grateful for Mr. Allen Carr's book, "The Easy Way To Stop Smoking" It put me in the right frame of mind to finally become a non-smoker. I would recommend this book to any one who wants to quit and think they can't. I smoked 1.5 packs a day for 40 years, was almost resigned to being a smoker until the day I died. After reading this book, quitting felt like turning off a switch. Today I'm free and grateful.

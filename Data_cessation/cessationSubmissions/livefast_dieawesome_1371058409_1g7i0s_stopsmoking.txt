The only one in my family NOT diagnosed with emphysema... quit day has arrived. Here we go!

Found out last night that my sister, who is not yet even 40 years old, has emphysema. Both of my parents have been recently diagnosed as well.  My paternal grandfather had it. My maternal grandmother as well as maternal aunt (who died of it).  Now I'm the only one in my family who doesn't have it yet.

I'm 29.  I always said I'd quit by 30.  Well, fuck... here we go.

It's about damn time...

I gave this habit up. Holy shit, I can't run for more than 15 minutes without feeling like the smog in Beijing has internalized in me. 10 minutes of weightlifting and it feels as if my heart is a seagull right smack in the middle of a BP Oil spill in all of its grimy entirety.

I've tried many times in the past, but to no avail. My most recent success was 1 week back in mid 2015, but a quick cigg and a beer with a friend I hadn't met in years turned into me buying packs again. So, I'm trying again starting from today (Cold Turkey) with what I think may be a renewed, and hopefully stronger, mindset. 

There are a few things I tell myself (Maybe it'll help you too!):

1) I started smoking at 19. That means that for 18 years I handled stressful situations and some pretty messed up ones WITHOUT the need to smoke. And if other people (non-smokers/ex-smokers) can do it, why can't I?

2) In every instance of our own thought process, there are moments of conscientiousness, or as some would say, moments of enhanced clarity. This is when you see yourself outside of the addiction, the habit, the routine. This is when you tell yourself, "No." I believe we always have a choice, and while difficult, just saying "No" when the urge to light one up releases our shackles just a little bit from the slavery of smoking. 

3) An addiction to exercising always helps. While nicotine makes you happy through the release of endorphins, exercise much more so, although you would obviously have to sweat it out, and if you're lucky enough, you may even get a runner's high (Best feeling in the world, I swear). 

But back to reality. It's day one for me, and I'm pretty glad I found this sub. The badge does help too.

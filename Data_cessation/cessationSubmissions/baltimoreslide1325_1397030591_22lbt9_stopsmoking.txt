Anyone have a quit smoking "app" that can be used on a computer, not a phone?

I keep seeing screenshots of quit smoking apps that folks are using on their smartphones. That looks pretty helpful, but I'm still using a flip phone that can't even receive pictures, let alone connect to the internet or run an app. 
Does anyone know of a similar thing that I could just use on my laptop?  

p.s. Day 5, dudes, and loving it. But my brain is going through some INTENSE shit today: all these damn emotions I'd been blocking off, ugh. Long walks are helping because the air smells good and springy where I am. This community is REALLY helping too. I'm glad I'm quit. Good luck to all!

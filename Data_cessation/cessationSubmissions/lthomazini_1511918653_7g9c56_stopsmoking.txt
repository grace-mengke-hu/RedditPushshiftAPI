Tips on how to navigate some side effects

Hi guys! 

It’s been 8 days since I last smoked. This is the third time I try to quit (I actually went through the hard part last time, quit for six months. Dumb me), but you know, third time is a charm. 

I have no desire of smoking again and am feeling great. I changed smoking for walking 10k steps a day and just started trying to run (I have a 5k goal). Overall, I am really feeling amazing. I’ve been suffering with anxiety and panic attacks, but I actually feel great mentally. 

But I have some side effects symptoms that give me hypochondriacal vibes. Though I know they are not permanent, I was wondering if any of you can give me some ideas on how to navigate them (I’m in Brazil, so please keep medicines/food as universal as possible). 

- My mouth is popping out with sores. Google say is normal, but my pain says there is something I could do. I put topic medicine and also took some Omeprazole for my stomach. Have any of you have that? Is there something else I can do? 

- No matter how much fiber I eat, I just can’t go number two. Between walking, eating tons of papaya and other fiber rich food, and drinking hibiscus tea, I’m at loss of what else I can do (I already drink liters of water everyday). Any tips? 

- I have some so called quit zits. I’ve actually taken accutane before, so getting zits is a sad sight for me. I haven’t set an appointment with my dermatologist yet because a) she is amazing but expensive and b) I don’t want to take any drugs I don’t need to and am hoping it will vanish on its own. Will it? Should I wait? 

On the other hand, I can breathe and smell great! I’m super proud of myself. Just want some help to make those next weeks a bit easier. 

Thank you (:

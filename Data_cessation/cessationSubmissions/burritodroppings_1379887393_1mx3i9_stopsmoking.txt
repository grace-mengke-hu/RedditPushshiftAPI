79 days cigarette free! Need some advise.

I'm happy and proud of myself that I've quit smoking. I'm ecstatic just thinking about day 100, but lately it has been a little harder than usual. A coworker of mine is very pro-smoking, and almost everytime we work together he will pester me and ask me if I want to join a smoke. I keep telling him I have quit, and asked him multiple times not to offer me a ciggarette. It seems like he just brushes my words off and continues offering. I don't want it to get to where he is on my last nerve and I end up snapping at him. I want to, and I know I have to, have a serious talk with him because this bothers me so much. I'm just not sure how to go about having this converasation. I have never been good with confrontation. So I was wondering if anyone else has had people like this in their lives, and how did you go about handling it? Any advise would be appreciated. Thank you!

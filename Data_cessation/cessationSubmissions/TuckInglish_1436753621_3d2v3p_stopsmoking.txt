On my 2nd, going into the 3rd day

So I saw this sub two days ago on Friday night, as I was thinking about whether I should stop smoking or not. A little background info: I am 20 years old, I started smoking when I was 17. I smoked at most ~9 cigarettes a day and that's usually when i'm chaining for whatever reason.

I watched a video that talked about the "little monster that craves the nicotine".

Every time I have felt like I "wanted" a cigarette I just picture the little monster from the video. I don't feel the cravings that bad and it has been surprisingly easy to not smoke. Of course the cravings come the most when I wake up, when I start driving, when I am taking a poop, or when I get a call on the phone. 

Today I have been thinking though that I am still really young and that it would probably not hurt if I continued smoking until around 22 since I have shown myself by these two days that I can stop... I completely feel I can not smoke now but a part of me just actually enjoys smoking? Is it possible that I am just suffering a craving that is telling my mind all these things?

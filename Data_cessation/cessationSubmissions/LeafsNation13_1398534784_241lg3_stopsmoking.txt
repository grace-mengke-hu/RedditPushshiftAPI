Trying to quit... just bought E-cig, Any help/ advice on nicotine levels is appreciated!

Just bought a Cloud Maker 2.0 from 180 smoke. Haven't had a real smoke in over 48 hours now (longest in 3 years) but I am concerned with the amount of Nicotine in the "juice" and cant seem to find any info on safe amounts ETC. Currently I have "1.2 % medium nicotine" Any help/ advice from fellow E cig users is greatly appreciated!

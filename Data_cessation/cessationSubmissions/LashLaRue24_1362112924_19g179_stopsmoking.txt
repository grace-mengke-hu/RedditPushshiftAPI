Rounding out day 4, found some good ways to not smoke...

So far I have punched a child, shoved an old man down a flight of stairs, and punted my cat down the street, but hey, at least I'm not smoking.

Okay, kidding. But, I am about to round out day 4 and for how irritable and anxious I've been, I feel surprisingly good right now. Stay strong, friends.

Any advice for quitting when your S/O does not quit?

New here, first post I am on day 28 of not smoking! I’m holding in there even though I feel a lot of crazy emotions. I’m wondering if anyone has experience in quitting smoking but your SO does not quit. I love this human a lot but it’s the smell I didn’t realize was so offensive. Am I just super sensitive to smells right now since I have just quit recently? Or am I just a total asshole for feeling this way? Anyone else deal with a similar situation?

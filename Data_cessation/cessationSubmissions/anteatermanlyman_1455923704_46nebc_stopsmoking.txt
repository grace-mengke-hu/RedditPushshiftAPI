Nicotine patch, day 2

Now that I think back to it, I'm the longest i've been without a cigarette since I relapsed in January :). Someone here encouraged me to try to cut it down from one cigarette to none and here I am.

Basically waited to put on my patch when I knew I was ready. Smoking with the patch on doesn't work it seems, as I ended up just smoking gradually more as time went on. Have had small urges, mostly because I was super busy this morning. Was downtown and saw a 3 dollars off a pack coupon for some marlboros, asked and they said it was for two packs (which is probably why someone left it lol), so I left it on the bus for a stranger. Other than that it's been smooth sailing. Didn't even feel frustrated, just went off and bought some groceries instead.

I dunno how long I'll make it this time but I'm gonna try to go on a roll, and hopefully forever :). When I get off the patch, which I'll try when I'm ready hopefully in a week or more, I dunno what to expect except the urge to come back. But avoiding conversation about smoking, I think I'll be good. That's also what brought me down those times, smokers offering cigarettes and secondhand smoke, which I'm trying my best to avoid :). Seeing a good friend that likes to smoke is hard to turn down, so I don't see them at all.

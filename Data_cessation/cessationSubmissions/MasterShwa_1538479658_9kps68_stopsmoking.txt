The journey so far.

Hey guys! First time poster on this sub. 

I’ve been trying to quit for the past 2 months. 
The first attempt, I cut down from having about 20 smokes in a day to one every 2 days but a friend of mine passed away and I ended up grabbing a pack. 

After smoking it. I went on to attempt to and didn’t touch a smoke until today. I went a week and 5 days without a smoke and today crashed a brought a pack.

It was a shit day at work and I just felt really down and frustrated that I needed a smoke. 
After having one I felt really shitty and kept beating myself up about it. 
I know that slip ups happen and every attempt is one step closer but how can I push through the craving when I get frustrated? I’ve pushed trough all my triggers and my routines I use to have. Just can’t get past the frustration part. 

Also how can not beat myself up if I do slip again? 

Thank you :)

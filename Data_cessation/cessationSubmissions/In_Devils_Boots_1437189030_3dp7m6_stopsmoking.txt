Quit date 7/24/15

After more than three decades of smoking, due to some health concerns I've decided to stop smoking.  I've made the decision and set a quit date.
Now what?  
How do I prepare for this? 
Guidance, suggestions, LPT's?  
Any and all ideas welcome.
Thanks, in advance.
Have a great evening.

Is there anything I can do to decrease the effects of smoking on my dad who smokes heavily everyday?

Hi all!

I wasn't sure if this type of question is correct for this sub, but I'm hoping if you guys can help. My dad (65) is a heavy smoker of cigarettes, and does not intend to stop anytime soon. My mom has tried to get him to quit but he's pretty stubborn and I honestly don't see that happening. It worries me because of course, smoking cigarettes is a huge cause of lung cancer. My dad is getting old and I'm still fairly young, and I want him to be around for as long as possible, yet I know his chances decrease every time he opens a new pack.

Is there anything at all I can do to help him with this? I know it seems pretty bleak, but any advice, even the littlest of things would help. Thank you.

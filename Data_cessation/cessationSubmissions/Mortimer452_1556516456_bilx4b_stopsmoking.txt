Everything tastes like ass

Quit about 2 months ago.  Randomly, for days, everything I eat will taste nasty like it's got some chemical in it.  I can't really explain it, other than it's almost like someone crushed aspirin and sprinkled it into everything I eat or drink.

To be fair - I actually quit smoking about 3 years ago, started vaping instead, it's the vape I quit 2 months ago.

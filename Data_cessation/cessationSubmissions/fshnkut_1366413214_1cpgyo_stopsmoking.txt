fuck this

I made it 30 days wanted to post my success story and fucking reddit wouldn't let me because i don't have enough rep or some shit.. right after that i found a pack of smokes in my friends car (he left me his car for couple of days). Ever since then it's been hell... i fucked up my diet and shit is just going down hill I can't even quit for a day.

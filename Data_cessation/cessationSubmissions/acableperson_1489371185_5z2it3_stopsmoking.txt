2 weeks in and it's starting to get really hard.

Week one i was just outright committed to stop. The craving would come but i would just say no and be "proud". That has completely worn off. The cravings i am getting are completely different than i thought they would be. I assumed it would be the intense feeling like i used to have when i woke up in the morning and didnt have any smokes and hunted around pockets, drawers, anything ect till i found one or accepted it and just went in my PJ's and bought a pack. But what i have is not intense, it's just i lingering feeling that i really want a fucking smoke. And it just appeared after 2 weeks randomly and i wont go away. It's just there, like a cloud over my head, that i want i goddamned cig. I've been flirting with the idea of buying a pack of American Spirits (not my brand) and smoking one and throwing the rest away but i know that is dumb and i always think better of it but im not sure how long i will last. I thought the first was the hardest, but this is kicking my ass. 

I need advice.

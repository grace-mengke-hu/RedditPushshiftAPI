For E-Cigarette Smokers. What are the pros and cons of smoking E-Cgis compared to regular cigarettes?

Obviously I'm trying to quit smoking. Going cold turkey is too hard, so I'm switching to E-cigs. It seems that any information I find online is extremely biased to one side or the other.

Do E-cigs help counter the cravings?

What are the risks/benefits of smoking E-cigs?

Is it any better for my lungs or body than smoking regular cigarettes?

Which brand would you suggest?

Currently I have the Blu E-Cigarettes.  It seems to do the job pretty well.  The only thing is I don't know how long it's going to last.  The tokes are hit or miss and the guy who sold it to me said it would be good for 800 hits, but I'm not really sure about that.  Opinions?

Thanks in advance.


UPDATE:  THANKS  /r/electronic_cigarette ! I'm currently on 28 days without a tobacco cigarette after 4 years of smoking, except for one slip up.  And that was mostly because I was in the company of females who wanted to go out for a smoke and I had just ran over my E-cig with my car a few hours earlier.  I tried Blu and Square (both disposable), but they sucked ass and either broke or the battery went dead within a few days.   Right now I'm using Green Smart Living and it satisfies all my needs.  Hits hard, cuts cravings down to almost zero, durable, rechargeable/refillable, almost odorless, and I still get to enjoy the act of smoking.

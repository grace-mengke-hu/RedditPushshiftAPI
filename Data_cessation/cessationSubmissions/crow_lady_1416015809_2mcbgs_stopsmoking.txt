I know that I should stop, but...

Hey guys. 
I've been a smoker for 6 years (not as long as many others, but still).
It starter with one or two cigs a day, now I'm at about 25 rolled.
I know that I *should* stop: I know the health risks, I know it makes you uglier, I know it hurts other people; but still, I can't find the true motivation needed to quit.
Anybody can offer some advice? I'm feeling really low, like I have no will power at all...

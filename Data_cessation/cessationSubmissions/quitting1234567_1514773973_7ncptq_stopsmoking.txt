Going back to school after break

I stopped smoking the last day of finals and since I’ve been home with my family I haven’t had any urge to smoke a cigarette. When I’m at school i live in a house with 4 of my friends who i don’t feel embarrassed or weird smoking cigarettes around so it makes it harder to actually stay quit. When I’m home I’m around my mom and dad who have no idea I smoke and would be disappointed if they found out so it’s much easier to stop cold turkey. I’m on my 10th day right now and won’t go back to school for another 2 weeks but I was wondering if anyone had advice on how to not to relapse once I’m back in that more independent, on-my-own type of environment.

Back on the wagon again - day 1

Hi everyone!  
I stopped smoking a few years ago, 2 years of non-smoking later and I started smoking on/off with the terrible reasoning that "I was stressed" with my new studies.  
After 1 year of shitty excuses and sneaky smoking, I want to stop again. I have the courage and mental fortitude to do it again. I will be visiting this sub when cravings get hard and I know that since I've done it before, I can do it again.   
I've reset my badge, downloaded the app and I'm ready to cold-turkey this. Wish me luck!!

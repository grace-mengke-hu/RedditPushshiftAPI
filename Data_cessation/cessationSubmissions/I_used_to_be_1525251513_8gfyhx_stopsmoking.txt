I stopped 4 days ago because my chest hurt.

20 years, on and off, I've quit for months before, and Ive gone back and forth between 3 cigs to 2 packs in a day.  These last few  months my depression has been creeping up and my smoking has cranked up along with it. Two weeks ago I couldn't get to sleep because it was hard to breathe.  I kept smoking anyway. Getting winded doing everyday activities became normal i don't know how long ago.  Days ago my chest started hurting all the time.  

I stopped smoking on friday, then stopped again on saturday.  I'm scared. The only thing that's stopping me from smoking right now is how scared I suddenly am of cancer, not the vague distant threat of it, but the sudden viceral fear that i can feel it in me.

I'm posting this because for the last three days I haven't even wanted a cigarette, I'm so fucking terrified of my shortness of breath, and the dull constant ache in my chest that even smelling someone elses cigarette is enough to make me sick.  

For the love of fucking anything, if you're struggling with this for some reason right now, please please please just take a few minutes to internalize the fear, if you can activate your self preservation instinct I promise you it's stronger than the cravings.  Don't let it get to where i am right now, the shortness of breath, the fucking certainty that you're going to get that death diagnosis, that youre going to suffocate on a beautiful day in the fresh air because you're a weak willed idiot... 

I'm fucking scared right now but the last thing i want is a god damned cigarette.

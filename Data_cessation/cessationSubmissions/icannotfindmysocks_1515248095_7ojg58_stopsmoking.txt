6 Years In...

I owe a lot of my success to this sub. Everyone who is struggling, keep with it. Everyone who was successful at one time sat where *you* are sitting now. 

I will be celebrating 6 years smoke free this March. 6 years of not having to buy a carton a week, of not freezing my rear off to make sure I'd get my nic fix. It took me a few times of quitting for it to stick and it wasn't easy. There are still times where it isn't easy. 

Just remind yourself of why you're quitting and how you'd feel 1 week/month/year from now if you give in. You got this.

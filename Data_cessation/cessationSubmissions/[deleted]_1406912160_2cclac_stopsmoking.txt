It's been a full 365 days, if you would've asked me a year ago I would be here... I'd tell you you're crazy.

I'm happy to say, cigarettes will never control me again. As a former smoker, you can quit too. Sure, it's tough. Sure, you'll get cravings. Sure, you'll be tested when you go out for drinks. Just remember how much time, money, and health you're saving. Since quitting I've become a happier, thinner, more positive person. I hope all of you can experience the bliss of finally being FREE.

Good luck to you all, and thank you for your support<3

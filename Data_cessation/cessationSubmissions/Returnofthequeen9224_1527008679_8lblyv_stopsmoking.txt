Cold Turkey &amp; Anxiety &amp; Failing

I posted last week that I was trying to quit, and I decided to quit cold turkey. A big part of why that didn’t work well for me is because I got severely anxious about not being able to have another cigarette, and when I’m anxious, I smoke. 

I’ve been feeling like a failure because I couldn’t quit, and while I know I should be proud that I’m at 50% of where I was, I’m just disappointed in myself.

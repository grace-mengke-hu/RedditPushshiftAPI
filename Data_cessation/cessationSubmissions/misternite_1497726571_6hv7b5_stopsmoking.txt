3 months - No feeling any better

Interested to see if anyone's experienced the same thing as me. 

I made the decision to stop, thinking that I would begin to feel better after a few weeks. Unfortunately it's been 3 months now and I still wake up with a sore throat and mouth full of phelgm everyday. Apart from better sense of smell and greater desire for dessert after a meal, I basically feel the same. 

Now I won't start again simply because I was sick of nicotine having so much power over my life but has anyone else experienced this? I'm thinking it may be because I'm a smoker of 9 years and so it just takes longer till some of the health benefits materialise in a way that I can feel them. Please do let me know if you've encountered anything similar.

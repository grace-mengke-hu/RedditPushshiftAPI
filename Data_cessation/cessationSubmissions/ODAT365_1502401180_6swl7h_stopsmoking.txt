I was a secretive smoker

Oh the guilt, the shame, the secretive smoking - that was all me. Few knew I smoked. It was torture and so i would sneak around and hide, even more torture. 

I'm blessed to be free today. Liberated. 

I read and post here every night. People help me and I try help them. 

It's a bloody good reminder to me that I'm only 1 puff away from a box a day!!

1 year! Running a 10-Miler in March!

Thanks for everyone's support, I really think this community is a large part of being sucessful with my quit.  I had tried to quit almost 10 times before, but could never get over a month.  The badge is a nice anchor and all support during the first few months of the struggle is very helpful. Everyone has been through what you are going through and they are there to help. I smoked cigarettes for 7 years and it feels like a huge weight has been lifted.  When I get anxiety, it calms down within minutes because my heart is healthy, instead of taking hours sometimes it would seem in my past to feel relaxed.  I exercise almost every day now and it has really improved my mood and outlook on life.  Running in the outdoors, breathing in fresh air, listening to the river, feeling the sun...It's all a lot better than a cigarette! If you have been meaning to quit, don't put it off.  Start today!

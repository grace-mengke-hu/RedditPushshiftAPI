Two weeks today!

I finally hit two weeks without a single puff on the juul! I’ve even started to take the patch off when I sleep and I’ve been able to get up and put it on in the mornings. It’s a big step for me considering mornings were always the hardest time for me to even think of going without hitting it but here I am! It feels so freeing and even on harder days I remind myself how proud my mom and my SO are! To top it all off I leave in three days to go visit my SO after close to two months apart and I’m already excited to not have to worry about hiding the juul from his family and I’ll be jumping down to the second step with him to support me! I never even thought I’d hit two weeks considering a month ago I was worried the age of nicotine was changing in a state I could go buy pods and the amount of money I’ve saved has probably been so much! And to everyone struggling you can do this!! Many thanks to this sub for keeping me going!!!!

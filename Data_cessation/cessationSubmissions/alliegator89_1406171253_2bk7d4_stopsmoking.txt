Had a giant breakdown but didn't smoke!

I'm almost done with day three. I just sobbed uncontrollably for an hour. I came very close to smoking. I even told my husband I was mad at him because he threw out the pack he broke down and bought earlier today. But I still haven't lit up in the past 72 hours.

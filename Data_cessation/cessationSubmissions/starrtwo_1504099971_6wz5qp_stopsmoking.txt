5 months, thinking about buying a pack

hey all, im at 5 months today. Lately I've been thinking a lot about just buying a pack and keeping them at home, having one every few days or something. Has anyone done this months after quitting? I know it would be hard to keep it to just one every few days, and i don't want to start smoking heavily again. It just keeps crossing my mind every day that I want to try a cig again, and have them around as a rare thing

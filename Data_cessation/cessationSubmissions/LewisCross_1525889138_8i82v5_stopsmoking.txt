14 Years.

Friday, May 11, 2018, will be my 14th smokefree birthday.   

Not a single bit of nicotine in 14 years. 

If I can do this, you can too. 

I was utterly hopeless.  I was to the point where I hated smoking.  Hated hated hated it.  Hated myself for doing it.   But smoking, and hating it, and hating myself, was "easier" and "less painful" than a few days of discomfort and some understanding how your body's addiction worked, and how it can be broken.  

Until that one day.  May 11, 2004.    In my car.  Smoking a last cigarette, from a pack I'd just bought.  I just *had* to go out and get a pack.  I *need* that pack.  *Need* it.  

Driving back home and polluting my lungs, I finally thought it. 

"I'm sick of this shit."

I'm sick of my addiction controlling me.  I'm sick of having to smoke. I'm sick of needing this.  I'm sick of the lost money. I'm sick of my wife, my friends and my kid frowning at me because I smell so bad.  I'm sick of hiding this from people.  I'm sick of going to such lengths to smoke and then hide it.  I'm sick of hacking up my lungs in the morning.  I'm sick of getting winded walking up half a flight of stairs.  I'm sick of getting bronchitis every year for 15 years now.   

I'm sick of this shit.   

I tossed the pack away.  I went home.  I went to bed.  

The next day I shoved nicotine gum in my mouth and suffered through 2 days of intense physical withdrawal with the gum just taking the edge off. 

Day 3 was better.  Day 4 was even better.   Day 5 was OK. 

I got rid of the gum on day 10.  

Day 11 was tough.

Day 12 was OK. 

Day 13 was GREAT.   

Not a cigarette since then.  

You can do this.  YOU CAN DO THIS.

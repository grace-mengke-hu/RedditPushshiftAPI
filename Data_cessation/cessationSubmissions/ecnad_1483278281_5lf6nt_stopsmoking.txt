It's been 1 year and 4 months. I've saved over $2000. But right now, I miss smoking more than ever before.

I've recently made a big move from a low-key part of the Pacific Northwest, USA to Paris, France to live with my girlfriend and eventually pursue a Master's degree. Grappling with the language has been tough, but it's going okay - I can recognize palpable progress, which is heartening. 

The thing is, the whole damn thing is stressful as fuck. French bureaucracy for expatriates and immigrants is so convoluted and asinine that as soon as I finish jumping through one hoop, I'm clamoring to deal with the next. I'm also finding it difficult to break into social circles - smoking was, for the longest time, just a part of the person I considered myself to be. I miss being able to take out a pack, quietly step out onto the terrace or into the back yard, and take a moment to decompress from social situations with a semi-legitimate excuse. These smoke breaks also helped break the ice with other folks doing the same - some of my closest friends whom I continue to be close with were made over cigarettes under a starry night sky.

In August of 2015, both my uncle and my girlfriend's aunt were diagnosed with lung cancer. Opposite ends of the globe, from Idaho to France, but random chance had a cruel sense of humor this time around. I finally decided to quit that month. My uncle eventually managed to beat it into remission. My girlfriend's aunt passed away. 

There's really no good way to wrap a rambling post like this up. Things are just tough right now, I guess. I know that smoking won't actually make me feel better in the long run, but I'll be damned if it isn't the most tantalizing fucking thing on my mind right now.

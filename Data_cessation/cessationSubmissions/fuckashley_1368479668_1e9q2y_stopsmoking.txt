Day 3 quitting, also day 2 being home from college for the summer. I'm afraid I'll be an asshole to my parents. Help!

I get really short tempered without cigarettes and have a habit of blowing up on people for nothing. I'm really worried that this will fall on my parents as I will be around them the most. Any way I could help this?

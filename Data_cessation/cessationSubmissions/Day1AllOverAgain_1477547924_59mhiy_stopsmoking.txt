Fell off the wagon

I was around 21 days in when I just couldn't resist. I needed to know what it tasted like, how it felt. So I bought a pack smoked one then threw them away like I just threw the last 21 days.

It's not worth it guys. All I can taste is that now sickening taste of tobacco and the regret of letting myself down. No excuses this time, day one all over again.

15 Days and counting

Doing fairly well at 15 days in. Seem to be fine at the house, fine while driving (thought this would be the hard one) it's when I get to my shop is when all hell breaks loose. The second I walk in the door the itch starts. Can't figure out why this place wants to be my trigger. I get through it everyday but I don't understand why it fights me so hard here. I guess over 35 years of smoking I may just have a few habits hard wired in.

Will I ever get that satisfied feeling again?

So I'm almost four days cigarette free.  And, yeah, sure, that sounds nice and everything.  But I miss the feeling of satisfaction that cigarettes offered me.  I've heard bullshit that quitting feels like sanctification to some people.  And I've heard that jogging or running gives you an endorphin high like feels like smoking, and, yeah, that's kinda true.  But it's not the same level of satisfaction.  Any advice, tips or hopes?

13 days and it's still hard

I'm on day 13 of quitting smoking cold turkey (after more than 20 years)  the urge to smoke isn't the bad part for me, I'm having major withdrawals. (Insomnia, tightness in my chest, dry mouth, no energy) I feel like no one talks about any of these things and only think craving the cigarette is hard.

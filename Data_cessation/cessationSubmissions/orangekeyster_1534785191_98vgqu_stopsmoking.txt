Advice needed!

So... I took up chantix about 6 months ago.. coming from about a pack a day. Quit for about 5 months w/o a cig. Now living w/ a roomate whos a smoker and have noticed that for about the past month or so i've been having one here and there, to now about 1-3 a day. Normally one at night after work. However, just went away with my gf for 3 days not a single craving and did not have one (she thinks im 100% quit free still). Any advice on how to shake the couple of cigs a day. I'm afraid it's going to snowball into more. I.E. drove home on lunch today to just have one! Redditors help!

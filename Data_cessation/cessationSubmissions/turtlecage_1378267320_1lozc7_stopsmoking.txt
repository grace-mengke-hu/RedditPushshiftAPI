Family drama and I just want a cigarette. Help.

My parents are getting divorced after 14 years of a toxic relationship that has poisoned by childhood. They are the reason I started smoking in the first place. 

They are both trying to pull me onto their side. They are both so full of shit. 

I know a cigarette won't help. My whole family smokes and there's cigarettes lying all over the place. That little demon want to light one. 

Help.

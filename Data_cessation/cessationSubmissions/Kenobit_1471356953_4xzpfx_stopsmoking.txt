Three days with no cigarettes

I've never smoked more than 4-5 cigs a day, but I've been going for 15 years and I never managed to kick the habit. It's also a stressful moment, so I started smoking more. This is not cool. I want to quit. It's been three days without nicotine. I had one small joint, without any tobacco: I'm not a heavy weed smoker, but I don't plan to stop with that. For now. I really hope I make it, this time!

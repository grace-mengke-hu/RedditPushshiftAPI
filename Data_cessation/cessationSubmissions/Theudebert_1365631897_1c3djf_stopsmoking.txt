Day 4 never felt so good . . .

So, today is my fourth day without nicotine OR alcohol, and I'm feeling surprisingly good.  Yesterday was really tough, and I was afraid it was just the beginning of even worse withdrawals.  But I seem to have gotten over the hump, and now hopefully I can look forward to smooth sailing as long as I keep some promises I have made to myself.  

You guys can do it too!

Constant dehydration?

Hey guys. Day 4 here and going strong. I realised recently that when I smoked my water intake was literally negligible while I'd have coffee every two hours. Now I realise the Consequence's of that lifestyle since my body is always craving water. My coffee intakes gone down to one in the morning and another before I go to bed and I tend to hydrate myself with fresh fruit juices throughout the day. 

Just wanted to know if others had a similar experience

First vacation as a non-smoker.

Went a little crazy (all that cigarette money saved) and went to Maui!  Was sad to see so many of the addicted who had to sit in the parking lot of the hotel or out of the way places by themselves. They couldn't just enjoy the time with their families, they had to feed the little monster, instead.  I was able to snorkel and SNUBA as a nonsmoker, which I could not have done so as a smoker.  All of the excursions would have been so stressful waiting for that next fix.

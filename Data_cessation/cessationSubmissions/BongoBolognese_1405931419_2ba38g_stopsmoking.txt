Smoked a whole pack!

After 13 years of smoking, I did not touch a cigarette over the last 15 days. I am really proud of that.

Last night I found myself in my backyard where I used to smoke with a pack of Marlboro in my hands. I smoked one, then one more. I knew it was weak but my mind kept telling me: "Come on you knew you could not do this. Screw it, it's not worth it". I smoked another one and another one feeling guilty as fuck telling myself that I will stay a smoker forever.

Then I woke up. I was shocked and thought about what happened. I haven't smoked, it was a dream. It was a nightmare. I am still smoke-free since 15 days ago. If you quit be prepared that your mind is going to play crazy tricks on you.

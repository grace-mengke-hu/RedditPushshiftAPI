My qunit plan, 12 days in

So I  eased into quitting.  I didn't focus on cutting back the amount of cigarettes in a day, but the amount of time. And I wore a patch during non-smoking hours. So the first week was 9 hour days, next 10, etc. I would smoke however much I wanted during the non-patch hours. Naturally though, I  started smoking less. It took about two months to get to an actual quit date and there were some days and some weeks where I didn't follow my plan at all.  But I still got back to it. I kept a planner and tracked how much I smoked every day. I'm 12 days smoke free with no relapses so far. I used the patch the first two days and then cold turkey since. I  originally planned to use the patch for as long as I wanted if it would keep me smoke free. I just got delayed putting it on the third day and then thought I would see how that went. I  mean, it wasn't great but it went alright. 
Don't get me wrong, I love cigarettes.  I love cigarettes with morning coffee, after a meal cigarette, talking with another smoker cigarette,  taking a break from work cigarette,  commuting cigarette, before bed cigarette- love them all. But at the end of the day, i'm not a moderate person and cigarettes were taking a toll on me in multiple ways. I could smoke a few in a row given rhe right circumstances.  So now i'm just not moderate in a different way.  I hope you can figure out a successful plan that works for you. And stumbling is okay. It's only a failure if you decide to not try again, ever.

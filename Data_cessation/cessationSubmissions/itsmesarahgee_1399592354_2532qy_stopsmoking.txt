Day 6, REALLY STRUGGLING!

I have been smoke-free for six days now, and today I had my first serious craving. Not just a little niggle at the back of my head, I mean a proper physical NEED to smoke. I am hoping this is not going to be a reoccurring issue as I'm scared I don't fight it next time round!
Any tips, words of wisdom, motivational speeches are welcome!!!

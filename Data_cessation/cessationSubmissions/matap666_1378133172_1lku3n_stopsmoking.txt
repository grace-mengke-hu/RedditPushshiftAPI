Symptoms when quitting smoking

Hey guys! Been almost a week since I quit cold turkey after 14 years of smoking. I'm not feeling the cravings to smoke, but I got a really sore throat, lost my voice for two days now (literally, I can't speak) and I'm coughing a lot.


Is that ok? It's the first time I've tried to quit, and I didn't know these side effects. Will the cravings come after this symptoms pass? As anyone had similar experiences?


Thanks guys, and rock on!

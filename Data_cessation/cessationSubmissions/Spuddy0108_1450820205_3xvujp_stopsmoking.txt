Day 2, bad withdrawal symptoms weirding me out.

Heavy smoker (60+cigs/day) trying to stop for the first time. 39 years old and smoking since i was 12. Smoked weed aswell for 19 years but had to quit after a acute pancreatic attack. I'm not going to bother you with a list of health issues i got, i have a lot of them. Last week i got a cold and it was pretty bad. I had these coughing fits that could last 10 minutes and felt like my lungs were ripping apart. They ended with my hands being covered in blood. I think this is the point where i thought i really have to do something. Well that and a  ton of other issues, like chronical stomach infection which wakes me up every 2 hours. 

Anyway, i quit smoking 2 days ago and today i had my first symptoms of withdrawal. This afternoon i was playing a bit of Subnautica and couldn't concentrate and was felt nauseous. In the evening while i was sitting in front of the pc and felt tired, i kept getting these 'brain shocks'. It's as if i was nodding of and my brain was warning me to wake up. They are really annoying and happen sometimes twice a minute. What is really annoying is, they happen while i'm lying in bed and i actually WANT to fall asleep. Every time i nod of i get this shock that instantly wakes me up and sometimes it goes paired with breathing in heavily. I had these last year for like 3 months straight and it made me go nuts. Now they are back after not smoking for 2 days. I don't see the connection.

And a third symptom i have is seeing green. I'm not kidding, when i open my eyes after having them closed for a couple of minutes, everything has a green hue, specially light colored things and highlights on shiny surfaces. This is really weirding me out. It's goes away after a minute or two but still, it's freaking me out. 

Anyone else recognize any of this? Sorry for the wall of text and bad writing. Not native English.

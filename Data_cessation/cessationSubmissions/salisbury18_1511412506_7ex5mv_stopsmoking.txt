Brain wrestles against addiction!

Quit day #22!! Ever since I quit, I’ve had a lot of dreams of myself smoking. Anyone else experience this? The dreams often feel so real, that I feel a ton of guilt and sadness when I wake up because “I had smoked.” The guilt though is soon replaced with a great deal of relief, when awareness kicks in that it was all just a dream. It is a good reminder and a great help though to stay nicotine free. Hoping these dreams will subdue soon!

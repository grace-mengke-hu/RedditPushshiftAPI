How to deal with rage?

Since I’ve stopped 10 or so days ago everything has been fine. Cravings here and there, but easily enough dealt with. Going to the bar and drinking tequila with a bunch of smokers was a nightmare, but I got through it. 

But today... **rage**.  I feel it in spurts quite frequently, when I’m driving for instance, but today I’ve been dealing with a prolonged, agonizing hatred that won’t leave my body. I wanted to smash my car into someone, get out, pull them out of their car and murder them. I want to smash and break everything I own. It’s Friday and I don’t want to have fun, see friends, or do anything other than hurt someone. 

Whenever I’ve felt this way in the past, smoking has helped calm me down. It’s been several hours now and this burning feeling inside of me has not dissipated. 

How do I deal with this?

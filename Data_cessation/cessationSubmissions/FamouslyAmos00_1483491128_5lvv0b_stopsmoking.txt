Grieving the loss of cigarettes

I am having a rough day so I thought I would post here and hopefully get some feedback. I am on day 64 of not smoking. I have made some great strides. I notice how long I go without thinking about cigarettes and I can tell I am not addicted to the nicotine anymore. This sadness I feel though can be likened to an ex that you broke up with a couple of months ago. The sting isn't nearly as strong, but it's still there. I think it's the worst when I am trying to have a really productive day. This feeling comes up when I would normally take a break/switch from tasks. It gave me something to do in a sense while I switched gears and I haven't found anything that can really replace it. 

No, I wont start back and yes I know this won't last forever. I just needed to share. Thanks for listening :) 

Edit: Thanks everyone for your input and support. Especially the video! I do need to get back to meditation.

HELP!! 48+ hours

I am on Chantix and smoked longer than I should have, granted only 1/2 cigarette a day.  I am on week 3 and 48+ hours smoke free.

My fiance smoked before he went to bed, sick, so I smell it lingering and can't "bother" him.  Send the troops before I go on a mission to find the "in case of emergency, break glass" cigarettes that he has hid from me!

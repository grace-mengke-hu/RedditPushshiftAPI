symptoms

hi, i was a quite heavy smoker (with short brakes). maybe not smoke for 3 days, then buy a pack and smoke it on one day. sometimes even two packs.

however, i am not coughing since i stopped. how can that be?

also i am waking up really early, but i do not feel tired. anyone else experiencing this?

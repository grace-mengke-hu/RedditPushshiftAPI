Thinking about doing P90X.

I'm considering doing the 90 day P90X workout.  This would be my physical outlet for stress instead of smoking. (not to mention I need to get back into shape anyway...) 

Has anyone else tried this workout?
How well did it work out for you if you did?
Any recommendations/advice when I do?

Thanks!
Stay Strong!

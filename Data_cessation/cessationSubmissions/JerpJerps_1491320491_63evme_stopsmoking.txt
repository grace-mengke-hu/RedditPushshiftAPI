How would one go about harnessing a feeling or a mindset?

I have tried countless amounts of times to stop smoking. I've smoked since I'm 15 and am now 30. In those years I have made a countless amount of attempts to quit. A month, half a year, a year, another year. But alas I am writing this having just had my morning smokes. What really engrained "I want to continue not being a smoker" in your brain? Every time I finally kick the habit it's generally due to the fact that I smoke a few one day and I realize how shit I am feeling. A tight heart, sore lungs, feeling nauseous from over smoking. In the moment it easy to say "enough of this crap" and quit for a given amount of time. But how do I stay quit? How do I remember that feeling of I can feel I'm killing my body? If one year down the road of not smoking I could just hit a switch and feel for a second how I feel at this moment it would be easy to not pick one up. But time and time again it happens.. Help?

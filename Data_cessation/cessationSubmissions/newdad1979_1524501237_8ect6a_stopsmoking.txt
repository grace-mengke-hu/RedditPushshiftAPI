Omg am i now a smoker, its only been 6 weeks?

Hey guys, I'll get to the point. About 6 weeks ago I started having the odd social cigarette with work colleagues at my new job. I had never ever smoked before and I'm 38. I went out with them on a break after being really stressed out, I got offered a cigarette and I took it. Don't even know why, but I have a deep feeling to fit in at the minute and it seems almost everyone in my office smokes.

I hated it to be honest, but this continued for a couple of weeks, I was smoking about 6 cigarettes a day. It got easier and not as horrible. I decided to buy my first pack 3 weeks ago because I felt terrible smoking everyone else's. Then I found I was smoking in the car on my own in the morning and on my drive home.

So the past 3 weeks I've been smoking 10 a day almost. Then my wife found out and lectured me but I said its just to help with the stress at the minute, so im making excuses already.

Now I'm smoking in the garden at home in the evening. I'm buying a pack every 2 days and I actually enjoy it. 

So that rang alarm bells, I stopped on Saturday but I wanted a cigarette all day, Sunday I started again and I'm smoking more than ever.

I knew smoking was addictive but surely I can't be addicted so soon? Why the hell do I enjoy it? And how do I stop now, I have rubbish will power, surely I can't be addicted.

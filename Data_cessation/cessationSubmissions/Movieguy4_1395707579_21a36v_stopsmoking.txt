I'm Only 18 Hours In and I'm Going Insane

I'm a Freshman in college, I've smoked since I was a junior in high school, and I decided yesterday to quit smoking cold turkey with a friend of mine.  

It's been pretty ridiculous so far, headaches, cravings, fatigue, I've been on edge all day, and a never ending surge of manic energy that causes me to want to act out.  

But worse is the emotional distress that I crave, rather than nicotine.  Smoking was never about in-taking nicotine, it was about the ritual.  The long walks to Exxon or the forest, where we could smoke and hang without judgement, the act of burning something slowly, the hand to mouth movement, and the fact that cigarettes are the one socially acceptable way I can stand outside of a party when I am feeling overwhelmed and introverted.  These are the things I am craving the most.  

Also, what the hell am i going to do when I'm drunk?  I am almost positive I will slip up then.  Or when I'm at work washing cars.  Or when I'm with my friends who smoke a lot.  Or when I'm at a concert.  Or after I eat.  

I don't know, I'm just scared, because I don't really know if I'm up to this.  Cigarettes have always been my fallback through most of high school and the majority of my first college year.  So the idea of quitting now seems so foreign to me.  The commitment scares the shit out of me too.  The idea that i will never smoke again.  It just kind of psychs me out.

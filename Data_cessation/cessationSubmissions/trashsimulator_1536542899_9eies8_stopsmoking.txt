2 months!

Today is 2 months since I quit. I’ve been using a salt nic vape, but it feels really good to be off cigs. I haven’t even wanted one in a month. I’ve never tried quitting with a nicotine replacement and it made a huge difference! I’m 28 and started smoking 2 years ago like an idiot, thinking I could just do it socially. At my worst I got up to about a pack a week, unless I was out partying and I could kill a pack in a night. 
It’s also helped a lot to cut back drinking - I drank once in the past month and I’m trying to cut that out for good as well. I finally feel like a non smoker and I’m so enjoying smelling good, not feeling like shit in the hot Texas sun, and being able to ride my bike without having to pack my asthma inhaler just in case. 

Thanks for all the support y’all!

Making up excuses. Help.

The most annoying part of quitting is ignoring those stupid excuses and plans why I should smoke.
In the first days I was really sick (unrelated to smoking/quitting). My first thought was "Mhm...that's bad timing. You should wait till you are health again and not feeling miserable, lying at home and bored anymore." 
Gladly I ignored it and made it through the first 3 days. It was easier than I thought, BECAUSE I was sick and miserable (about being sick at not about missing cigarettes).

Now I got an invite to an job interview next week. First thought "Great! Let's celebrate with a cigarette!", which I didn't do. Next is the thought that I will be really really nervous and the thing I did when I was nervous/anxious was smoking. The more I think about the interview and prepare myself, the more I want a cigarette. I know that it doesn't have any magical powers that make me less nervous but it was my coping mechanism and I don't know how to replace it. Help.

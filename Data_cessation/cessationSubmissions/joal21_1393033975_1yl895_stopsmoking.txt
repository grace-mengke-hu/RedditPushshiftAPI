I am going to start quitting. Any suggestions and guidelines?

I'm about to have a kid and that's my MAIN motivation for this. Also, of course, health since I've started working out this year. 

But I still can't quit. They say that the first step is acceptance - accepting that smoking is bad and unhealthy and useless or pointless. But every time I try to quit or dial down on the number of sticks, when I'm stressed, or after I eat... Even just every time I'm not doing anything, I find it really hard to resist.

Anything will do. Even a little motivation or internet moral support. I will greatly appreciate it.

Also, thanks to /u/CaptainBipto for introducing me to this sub.

Day 16 and struggling.....

I am on day 16, using patches and an inhalator but am struggling big time. I so want a cig but know if I ever light up again I will never stop. I believe I have to be a non smoker for health reasons. I went to a party last night and struggled big time. I went outside at one point and had a cry. I really never knew how hard this would be. Has anyone else struggled as much as me? Dies it get easier?

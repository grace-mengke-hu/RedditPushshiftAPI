Is it merely a matter of will-power?

Regarding the cold turkey method. Is it merely willpower? Because thats how I handle each and every individual craving. I think the trick is not to be too forward thinking and think about being smokefree tomorrow or the next day, just to get over the hump striaght in front of you. I guess it's like how runners focus on their run step by step to keep their mind active and present. I was wondering if people would be able to share their thoughts on their quitting experience in general

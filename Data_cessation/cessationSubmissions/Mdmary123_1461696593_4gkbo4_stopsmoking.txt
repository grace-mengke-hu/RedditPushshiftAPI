What was your process for quitting? Did you quit cold turkey or cut back slowly?

Did you cut back to a few a day then 1 a day then quit? Has anyone been successfull with vaporizers helping then quit? 

I've gone from 2 packs a day to 10 or less and I already feel so much better, I can breath better. I'm trying to hold off as long as I can in between smokes. 

They disgust me and don't taste good either anymore but after a couple hours I'm craving one again. Plus when I'm around my husband, he's constantly going outside to smoke, which reminds me of it. 

I'm so disgusted by how much money I've wasted on cigarettes, $20 a day for both of us. Other times I've tried to cut back and ended up forgetting within a couple days, this time I am determined. 
Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated.

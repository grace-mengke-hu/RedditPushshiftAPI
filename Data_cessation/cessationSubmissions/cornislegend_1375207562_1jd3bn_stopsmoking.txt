Today is the day!

Well, I've been smoking pot daily since I was 17, smoking my friends cigarettes until I hit 19 when I started a new job at a call centre and was legally allowed to by smokes in my province. After that, i turned into a half a pack (depending on the day a full pack...) smoker, and I've been at both weed and smokes for the last 3 years.


I stopped the pot yesterday, calming myself down with the rest of my pack of smokes, but once I hit that last smoke, I decided "FUCK IT! Im gonna drop it all." So here I am! Just wanted to get that all out there, I'm pretty excited.

I've quit smoking weed before, but never cigarettes. What can I expect, typically, from the next couple days?

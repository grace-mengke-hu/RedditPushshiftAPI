Dealing with stressful situations?

Ever since quit day I've been living in a bubble, wasn't exposed to anything smoking related and haven't told people I know that I'm quitting because I don't want to talk about it.

But in 2 days I have a huge exam that cost me hundreds of euros and I don't know how to relax. If I fail, it will be because I'm stressed out/can't focus. 

Anyone have any tips on how to deal with something like that? Taking a deep breath doesn't really cut it.

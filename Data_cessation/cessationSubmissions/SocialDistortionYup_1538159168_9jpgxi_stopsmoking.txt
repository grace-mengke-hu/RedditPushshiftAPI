I want to smoke even though it will make things a hundred times worse

I am having a very hard day with general anxiety today. Im almost 3 months free from cigarettes and my brain is telling me to smoke a cigarette as a way to escape. Cigarettes made my anxiety so bad in the first place, and made me angry, self-loathing, ashamed. I WONT smoke today but the craving is strong!

Why do I (we) run to things that are not good for us?

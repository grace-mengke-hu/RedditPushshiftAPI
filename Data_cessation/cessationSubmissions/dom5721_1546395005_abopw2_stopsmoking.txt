Did anyone else feel the same?

Hi guys I'm 21 and have smoked on and off since i was in my last year of school, so around 16. I've never been an addicted smoker, I've not found it hard to quit as I can distract myself easily. But I've recently just had to force myself to stop. I started again around a month ago and if I have more than 3 rollies in a single day, my stomach feels really sickly and light headed.

I try and drink as much water as I can but sometimes don't bother until my body tells me to. Otherwise I just get water through food and the odd cup of tea and coffee, I was wondering if that could be a factor ? I'm in the process of stopping all together because of it making my stomach sick, and for the other obvious health reasons from cigs. Any advice is appreciated. Happy new year !

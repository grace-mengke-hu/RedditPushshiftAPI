2 months smoke free, still struggling with (mental) cravings

I stopped smoking two months ago after two years of smoking, and I still struggle with mentally craving cigarettes, to the point where it gives me severe anxiety to know I can't have one (I also have a mental illness that probably doesn't help with the anxiety problem). I can't even see a picture of a cigarette without spiraling.

Has anyone else had this problem? Does it eventually go away?

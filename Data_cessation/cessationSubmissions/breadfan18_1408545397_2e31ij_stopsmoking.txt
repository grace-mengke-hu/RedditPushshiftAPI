Deep breaths?

Hi fellow quitters :P, today is my 23rd day and I am going strong! However, I have been feeling kind of uncomfortable with my breathing. I just constantly feel the need for long deep breath as if I'm not getting enough air! Last night, I couldn't sleep for a while because it felt like i had asthma. I mean it's not like i can't breathe normally..I can! But i just feel a strange sensation to just take a long deep breath..and even that feels not enough! Have you quitters experienced this too?

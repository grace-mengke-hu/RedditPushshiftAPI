I Stopped Smoking and Started Vaping.

I quit quite a while ago—I'd say a year or two. I used nicotine gum to kick it and I've not been pretty well smoke-less. I've had one or two at social gatherings and I'm proud to say that it's not enough to trigger any sort of relapse.

When I first started to quit, I found that I had the typical withdrawals like irritability and dreamed frequently of having a cigarette. I got into e-cigarettes and now currently use a vaporizer. At the same time it's not helping with any sort of addiction to nicotine (which I feel isn't as hardcore as back then anyway), I don't crave cigarettes specifically.

I won't say that I'll deny myself one in the future, but I've learned my restrictions and I know not to tempt myself into getting back in the habit. At the time it seemed impossible and even after months I would crave one when I would see people doing it. Recently I ended up getting really stressed out at my job working a lot of hours for shit pay, so I would frequently bum some off my manager on breaks, but never went to buy a pack of my own ^or ^I'd ^have ^spiraled ^downward. Once I started relying on drinking rum once I got home to clear my mind I quit my job because it wasn't worth starting *that* habit either.

I'm comfortable with vaping and do it daily. It helps with that *morning cigarette* feeling and is indoor friendly in a non-smoking apartment, tastes fantastic, and doesn't make your clothes reek. The high isn't the same, of course, but after having a cigarette once I had quit a while before—I wondered 'why was *this* so fantastic?' and felt rather unimpressed.

While I am regretful of the physical harm I did to my body, I am very thankful for the educational experience behind it all. I know what an addiction can feel like (but still can't imagine the harsh addictions to hardcore drugs), but I know how overpowering such a thing can be and hopefully I can help others who want to quit.

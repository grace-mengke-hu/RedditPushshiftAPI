Hello Everyone here is my story... to success!

Long story short...

Hello everybody my name is Tenacious1 Im 30 years old. I started smoking when I was 15 stupidly thinking I was the cool kid in High School.  I smoked on average 2 packs (40) a day. I tried quitting numerous times with out success. The patch, gum, fake cigarettes, ecigs, substituting smokes for chewing tobacco, beating my head on a wall and smoking until I got sick. Nothing had worked!  Then one day I decided to look into ways people quit on this wonderful website that IS my new addiction, Reddit. After reading some success stories and trolling a couple profiles I decided to give The Easy Way To Quit Smoking (by: Allen Carr) a try. Well let me not be the last to tell you it worked!  I picked a day 12/22/2012 (the day after the end of the world) and stuck to it! I was no easy road but with some pointers from the book and personal courage I managed to quit! 

People always say I'll quit when I can, work is to stressful, blah blah blah... Let me tell you, excuses are like A$$holes everyone has one and they all stink! On 12/23/2012 I had to go to work a 24 hour long shift dealing with Adult babies! So I dont wanna hear your pitty excuses! No one is making you the addict except for yourself! 

I hope someone reading this might think to them selves that it is possible to quit and they will stick to it!! Good luck folks!

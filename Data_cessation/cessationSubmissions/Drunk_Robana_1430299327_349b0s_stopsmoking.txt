It's time to start.

I have about half a pack of cigerettes left, and I want to quit. I've tried before in the past on my own, and I have obviously failed. I've tried gum, patches all that shit. I've never really talked about this addiction to anyone, and after lurking in the community for a couple of hours I now realize that is not the way. Personally I'm tired of breathing heavily. I'm tired of being the only friend that smokes. I'm tired of cigarettes. 

Edit:Ignore my badge, I fucked up when I messaged the bot.

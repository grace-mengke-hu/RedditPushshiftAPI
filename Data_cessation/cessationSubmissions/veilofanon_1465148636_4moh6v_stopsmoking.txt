Twin sister finally quitting. How can I help?

tl;dr Sis finally means it. How much is Chantix, and how else should I help her feel supported?

She's smoked for over 10 years now. In the first few years, I really tried to push her to quit. Once, she really blew up at me and told me I had to stop pressuring her. She said that she would quit in her own time. I respected her wishes.

She is going to try Chantix, but :

- I asked her how long it takes and she said "a month." I'm afraid she doesn't realize it is supposed to take 3-6 months. How do I tell her I think she needs to read the brochure more closely?
- She hasn't told me whether her insurance will cover it. If it doesn't, I'm afraid she'll quit buying Chantix because it's expensive. How expensive is it? Maybe 250 a month? I want to just send her money so she can keep buying it. Is that pushy? How much should I send?
- I think she needs support from people other than me. She probably knows a lot more about quitting smoking than I do, but I probably spend a lot more time on the internet and I know communities like this are really helpful. Is it pushy to send her info (like a link to this subreddit?)?
- She drinks a significant amount - it's related to her job. Anyway, it seems like she'll have to dial it back for Chantix. She gets CRAZY irritable when she tries to quit smoking... does anyone have any idea how bad it will get if she's drinking less at the same time?


What should I do, as her sister, that I haven't yet thought of? Should I send her snacks, gum, books, letters of support?

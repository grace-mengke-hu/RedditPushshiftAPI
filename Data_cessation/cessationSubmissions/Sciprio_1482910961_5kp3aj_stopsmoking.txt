Never give up trying!

I am an ex smoker who smoked for over seven years and off them now around eight years. I remember waiting outside a shop and an old women comes upto me(late,60s/mid 70s) and she asked me was i smoking(I was and hid the smoke behind my back) She then said to me that smoking had killed her son and that i should stop.

One thing stuck with me after that, Giving them up, The first time i tried, I failed after four days, The second time i tried i got to my fifth day and had beaten my previous record of four days by a day and kept on going and here i am now eight years later and am now smoke free. 

I actually never thought i'd get to this day giving up smokes but here i am now. If i can succeed then so can you, keep going and don't ever stop. I failed at first but i tried again and i did it. Everyone can do this.

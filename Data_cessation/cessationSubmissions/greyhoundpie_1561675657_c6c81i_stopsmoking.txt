4 months since I had a puff. Starting to really miss smoking cigs now when weather is better.

I think I'm far enough way that the first "shine" of quitting is gone. I don't have any nicotine cravings but every time I see someone smoke a cig, I'm torn between thinking "f*** that" and "oh my God, that guy is so lucky he is "allowed" to smoke".

Not sure why om posting this. I'm staying strong, don't worry :)

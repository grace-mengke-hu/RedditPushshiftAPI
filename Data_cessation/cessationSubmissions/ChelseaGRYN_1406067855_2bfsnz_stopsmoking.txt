Day 9: First weekend done and I whipped its ass!

The physical addiction is gone as far as I can tell. The mental is alive and well. I felt it the most while I was out with friends. The smokers were very supportive and hid from me (thanks guys!). I found that when the craving comes if I go for a walk or do any kind of exercise, even stretching, it helped make it go away. I think its just a matter of taking your mind off of it, out of sight out of mind type of thing. 
Anyway the important thing I didn't smoke!!!! 
One strange thing is I was a smoker for 21 years and I still haven't hacked up anything. Am I just lucky or is it to early yet? 
 The lozenges are done with, no withdrawal stopping those. Last one I took was approx. 1/2mg nicotine on Saturday morning. Ive picked up a new addiction though....toothpicks. Menthol fkn toothpicks! Ah well keeping my hands busy :)

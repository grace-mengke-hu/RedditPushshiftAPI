Here we go!

Long story short, 

Smoked 7 years. Want to quit, but always succumbed back.

I stumbled across this subreddit and realized maybe this is what I was missing. A support system with peers trying to do the same thing.

I will be smoking my last cigarette today(*fingers crossed). I will be logging my days on this subreddit if all goes well~

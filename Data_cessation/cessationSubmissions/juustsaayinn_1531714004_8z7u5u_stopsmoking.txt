27 Hours. Maybe I should continue.

I've been smoking a pack a day for too long. The longest I go without a cigarette on an average day is about 45 minutes.  I've read other peoples successes on here for a while now. it's inspiring. 

Had my last smoke before heading to my night shift yesterday. It's been 27 hours. I'm thinking now is the time to stop. 

I still have some nicotine patches from the last time I tried. My mind is in the right place. I can keep this going. What do you guys do on your "smoke breaks" to fill the time?

Day 5 check in...

Hey Stop Smoking!  Checking in on day 5.  As of right now the biggest thing I'm fighting is habit and patterns of what used to be normal.  Cravings hit in a way of "oh, time to go smoke" or just feeling like I should be smoking at certain times.  I have zero interest in starting that filthy habit again and in 5 short days I'm actually feeling better.

Bonus:  My "smokers tongue" that thick layer of coating that's always on your tongue, is starting to disappear, so that's pretty cool.

Keep up the good fight folks, it's so worth it.

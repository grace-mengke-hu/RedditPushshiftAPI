Day 4 .... still fantasizing about a smoke down the road

Overall I’m doing great with this quit. Reread Allen Carr and am on vacation with my parents, so a very non-smoking environment and lots of vitamin D. But even though I physically feel better, I’m fantasizing about down the road being able to light up at a concert or music festival (kind of my favourite thing ever). 

Allen Carr tells us that no one REALLY enjoys smoking. But I don’t know about that one. 

Anyways, I’m doing well - the cravings are annoying but manageable -  not too worried about slipping. Just trying to stop romanticizing the cigarettes I guess. Anyone else feel this way? Any advice on changing this mindset?

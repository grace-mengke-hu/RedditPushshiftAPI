Quitting Together - Wearing Bow Ties and Suits

I started smoking when I was 15. I’ve smoked for 13 years.

I was traveling with my older brother a  couple of months ago. He’s my best friend, a life mentor and my rock. While we were on the road, we stopped for a cigarette. While talking, I asked him “When we’re old, in our 70s and 80s, can we wear really nice suits together with bow ties and go around town looking super fresh? I see us doing that, and it would be awesome.” It was a half-joke, but it’d be cool.

He laughed for a moment, then looked slightly serious, and then the conversation moved on. I didn’t think anything of it.

I’ve been wanting to quit for awhile. My brother never really mentions quitting though. I’m in week 2 without a cigarette now. I hadn’t told anyone about my quitting, since I don’t want to jinx it, or maybe I don’t want to deal with the potential of embarrassment or be held accountable if I fail.

Two days ago I found out my brother is also in week 2 of quitting. Coincidentally, we had picked the same quit date, without even talking to each other about it.  When I asked him how this all came about, since he never expressed wanting to quit before, he said “You want to grow old with me and wear suits and bow ties, now I have to make that happen. I have to be alive to make that happen. We owe it to each other now.”

I guess you never know what kind of benign comment will motivate someone to quit. We’re in this together now, for each other and the bow ties and suits. It makes me tear up a little. Sorry for the long story, I just needed to tell someone, even if it’s strangers.

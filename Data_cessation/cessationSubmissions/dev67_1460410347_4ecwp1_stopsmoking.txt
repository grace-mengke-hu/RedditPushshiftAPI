15 hours in, 2 packs of gum later...

I think this time is for real. Pack a day for about 5 years and this is the first time quitting that I'm not hiding myself cheat smokes or using a vape. Wish me luck everyone, I'll be back here when I'm feeling weak or just to encourage others! Fuck smoking. Fuck cancer.

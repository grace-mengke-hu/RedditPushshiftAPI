Day Zero - Some thanks and request for advice

So, I finished Allen Carr's book, and today is finally my quit date. I just took my last work smoke break and am committed to making this time work.

The birth of my son has been my largest motivation to quit, but I have also been thankful for this subreddit. While I haven't really posted here, I have been reading for the past year or so. I'd first like to thank you all for the support, advice, and plain sense that this community doles out on a daily basis. Those of you who have gone smoke free have been an inspiration to me, and I don't use that word lightly.

I guess the one thing I could really use some advice about has to do with a situation in which I am the only non-smoker in a group. I have regular get togethers in which all of my friends are smoking. Starting this week, I will be the only one who is not, and I'm not sure how to get ready for the experience. Previously, it had been so easy to smoke thoughtlessly, largely because everyone else was doing the same thing. What are some ways that you folks have found to successfully deal with situations like that (apart from just removing myself from the situation, which I'm not willing to do).  Thank you, as always!

Fear of Relapsing

Hi all, I’ve been on a holiday for two weeks and I’m going back to uni in about three days. I’d been smoke free from Sep to the end of Dec and relapsed, then quit again on 6th of Jan. I have a fair quitting experience at uni but I know that I had to resist a lot because 95% my friends smoke. I am now fearing that I might somehow relapse again when I go back and I want to take precautions against it. I don’t want to relapse at all. I need quitting for my voice and for my energy but last time was so hard. Can you please help me? How can I prepare myself mentally? Thanks in advance and good luck to all of you!

I can sing!

I always listen to music while I clean my house, and love to sing along. Today I was belting out a number, and my voice didn't crack, I didn't run out of breath on the big notes and I was loud! My family will probably tell you that I wasn't anymore tuneful than before I quit, but boy! My lung capacity is out of this world. After smoking for so long, I had no idea how much it was affecting my lungs. So, turn up that music and test those newly cleaned lungs!

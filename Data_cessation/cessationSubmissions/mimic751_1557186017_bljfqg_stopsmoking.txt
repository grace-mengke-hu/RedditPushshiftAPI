Update! 2 months in the books

I really doubt my midnight cigarette craving will ever go away, but the doctor said I am cleared for surgery as my risk for infection is gone.


I have been to the bar, and on two road trips, And got super drunk at a craft brew festival with 0 cigs...  really a big milestone for me.

Smoke free skin/ hair question.

I quit smoking, so i now want to look significantly younger than i actually am. Please share with me your tips for better skin/ hair/ eyes/ look. 

Tips may range from "drink yo water"  to  "sacrifice a goat and dance on your elbows"..

Thanks a bunch you non smokers you..

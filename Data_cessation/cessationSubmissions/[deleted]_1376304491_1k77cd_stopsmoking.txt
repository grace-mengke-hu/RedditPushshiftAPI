Starting to smoke.

I've slowly been becoming a smoker over the past year. It started one night hanging out with my cousin. Just smoked a few cigarettes as we talked. Since then I slowly ramped it up, and like anyone else I never meant for it. I'm not to far into the addiction, no withdrawal or dependency, but mentally I'm hooked. I've smoked only about 15 packs the past year, but I feel guilty and unhealthy after every night of smoking. I smoked almost a pack last night, and its never as good as you think it will be, and it's on my mind most of the night, really worsening the nights. Right now, my lungs also feel like shit. I want some help on how to approach quitting. I'll go a week without smoking all the time, but smoking is becoming a more and more frequent thing. Any help is appreciated.

9 months all it took was one cigarette to spiral downward.

It started off slowly - "a cigarillo isn't a cigarette. I won't inhale" turned into, "might as well finish the pack..." to finally "If I pool my change, can I buy some cigarrettes?"

I had quit cold turkey, and my descent back into smoking was a slow but steady slide. I was offered a cigarillo one night and I took it - "I won't get hooked again" I said.

That was 6 months ago. I kept trying to hide it from my SO and avoid it at work but it was inescapable. As unfair as it may be, people judge you for smoking.

I got serious 12 days ago, and decided end it right there. 

I was too embarrassed to post here admitting failure despite reading the posts nearly every day. 

I'm proud to say I'm back on track. Thank you.

Does anyone else have dreams where they smoke, and feel bad about it when they wake up?

I quit for three years only to lightly start back up for a year. When I first quit I don't remember having this problem. I quit again a couple months ago after I started back up. It's been pretty easy, all things considered, but I keep having these stupid dreams about smoking.

I will be somewhere and someone will offer me a cigarette. I'll take a few hits and then I wake up. I feel guilty when I wake up like I actually smoked and often think for a bit that I did the night before. Then I realize I don't smell like smoke and I don't taste it so it had to have been the dream. I'm left there feeling guilty for something I didn't do, only in a dream.

Does anyone else get this? It's driving me crazy!

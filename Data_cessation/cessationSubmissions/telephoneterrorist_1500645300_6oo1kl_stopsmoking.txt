I'm quitting today!

I have been a pack a day smoker since I was 15 I'm now 33. I'm definitely feeling the effects of smoking... I have tried everything to quit to no avail. I know that if I continue I'm going to have some serious health complications and I don't want that. 

I've started to hate smoking and each one makes me feel like shit afterwards but I can't give it up. I'm the kind of smoker that starts to panic about the next pack when I still have half a pack left. It's ridiculous! 

My son turns 1 on August 1st and the best gift I can give him is for me to be a non smoker. I'm looking for support because I get very moody, what has helped you guys? My wife hates the attitude I get with nicotine withdrawal. I need all the help I can get guys!

1 month down, thanks to you all!

Got my star yesterday, and am especially proud that I made it through last weekend, which was incredibly stressful. I resorted to using an e-cigarette with no nicotine in order to get past a mental block I was having, but I'm SO happy to know that I made it a month. I have a lot more stressful deadlines coming up in the next few months and they were hanging over my head, but after making it through that first one I know I can take the rest on.

This sub is a huge part of my success, and watching all of you on here struggle and succeed has been incredibly helpful. Thank you, thank you, thank you, for responding to my posts, for sharing your victories and stumbles, for your encouragement, and for kicking my ass a little bit when I needed it!

You are a great group of people doing an amazing thing, and I respect every one of you for your efforts.

1 MONTH! Never going back!

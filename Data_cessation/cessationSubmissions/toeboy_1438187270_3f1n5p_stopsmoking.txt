this is a lot more difficult than i thought.

the first two days were cake, didn't really have an issue with not smoking. but today, i'm at work and then it all hits me at once. i start getting super emotional and irritable with a terrible, pulsing headache. 

i almost cracked. i almost smoked a cigarette. if it weren't for my SO also quitting, i would have broken down. i'd've felt like a failure if i'd broken. 

what are some things i should know? i've never successfully quit smoking before and would love some advice/tips/support/whatever else.

this is tough.

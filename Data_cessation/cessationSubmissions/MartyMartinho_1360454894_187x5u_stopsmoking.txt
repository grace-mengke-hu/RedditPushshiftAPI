Smoke free since 15 January!

Hello everyone!  I hope that all of you who have stopped or are working on quitting are hanging in there!  I have not had a smoke since 15 January and I feel awesome.  Allen Carr's EasyWay book was a TREMENDOUS help for me because it helped me SEE smoking differently.  Granted, I went into the book already wanting to be a non smoker so I feel I was ready for what he had to say to me.  I started by checking out a YouTube clip of him telling his story and it was all over from there!!  Straight to Amazon!

I would like to thank this subreddit for all of your support and stories! Please feel free to share some of your stories!

Thanks a lot!

Hopefully just smoked my last cigarette. And a question.

I was going to wait until tomorrow morning to quit but I only made it 18 hours last time, sooo I was thinking I would like to sleep through some of the worst part, does that even make sense? Lol. I have anxiety and depression and was on no medication last time. Now I'm on Zoloft, klonopin and just started wellbutrin last month to help me quit. So hopefully I'm more well equipped this time around. Any advice on quitting with anxiety would be appreciated!!

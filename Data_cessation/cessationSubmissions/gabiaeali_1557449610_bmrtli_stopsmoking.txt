Journal journal journal!

When a craving hits, write yourself through it! Talk to your journal about how you feel when you are not having a craving, too, to read through when one hits and know you will feel that good again! You just have to persevere. Jot down your milestones and achievements that you don't want to ruin by sparking up. This has helped me tremendously. I also have a small canvas with my quit reasons hanging in my living room. Hope this helps!

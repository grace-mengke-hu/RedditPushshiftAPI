I've got the urge...

On Sunday I escaped smoking. I feel no real need to smoke in relation to addiction. I've recognized the "hunger pang" as the withdraw.  I feel great knowing that I won't smoke again.

But damnit, I was told not to come in today for the first time in 14 years of working. I've never been sent home or anything like that unless it was related to injury or illness. I just want to chain smoke so fucking bad to just chain smoke. Its not an "I need a cigarette" feeling. I used to chain smoke when I was pissed, it was just what I did.

Now I'm pacing backing and forth and being pissed. Except I don't have a cigarette in my hand while I'm doing it. I must rethink my anger time activities!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I made it!

Left the house, went out and did things... thought about cigarettes many, many times. Got a little (internally) bitchy when I saw people out on the street smoking and knowing I wasn't going to have one too. But then I stopped, thought about it and readjusted my attitude. I wasn't missing anything and I am gaining so much! It was still super hard, but, I realized my attitude has tons to do with how I feel about this. I can choose to be miserable... or choose to be happy about the decision *I* made to quit. No one forced me to stop smoking. *I* chose to quit because I want to be free of addiction. Damn. That little bit of thinking made a huge difference!

How is everyone today? Need any support? I am here for you!

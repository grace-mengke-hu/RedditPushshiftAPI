Relapsed after 6 wonderful smoke free days!!

 I dont know why i really smoked. Ive been thinking about smoking since day 3 and after day 6, I went to a friend and borrowed 4 cigarettes, smoked 2, flushed the other 2 in digust/guilt. 
I went for a long walk after and figured this doesn't change anything. I still dont want to smoke. I reset my timer and im going to try harder. I didnt fail, my resolve just got stronger!

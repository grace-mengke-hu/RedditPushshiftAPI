A question for those going through their first month/went through it. What strategies did you use to cope?

This can mean many things. Ranging from hobbies, certain thought exercises, etc. I'm only on day four, and I've found cooking and practicing my bass helps. Also, I think about how my senses will improve over time. What are yours?

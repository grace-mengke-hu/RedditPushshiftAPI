21 days in: Angry and horny

Hi all, am 21 days into my quit. In the last few days, I've noticed i've been a lot more energetic. I swear more and am more argumentative, but I quite like it, it's better than apathy and torpor. TMI possibly, but my libido is going through the fucking roof, possibly on account of increased energy, but also to counter the dopamine lost from quitting nicotine. Anyone else relate?

Ready to quit (again)

I was scrolling through this sub and I noticed a title that caught me.  I've been quietly cutting back on my smoking over the last month and I think I'm ready to quietly quit again. This weekend I cleaned out my car and changed the in cabin air filer (LPT: to help get the smell out) and made the commitment to no smoking in the car. Which actually cuts out a lot of my smoking since my job doesn't allow smoking on the property. We have to smoke in our cars. I'm developing a new morning routine and don't actively smoke after supper time. 

In the past, I've made all these bold statements and used Chantix last year to quit. I just want to do this on my own terms. I need accountability, but I don't have a very deep or stable support system. I realize this is likely while I've failed in the past. 

I found a lot of great reading material in this sub so I'm going to start there. Any other suggestions or words of support are welcome.

This has gone long enough

I've been trying to quit for the last 2 1/2 years. I was thinking that all it is required is waiting it out for a period of time until you magically are free from it and you've escaped. Browsing a bit on here makes it seem like it's much worse than that, as if all throughout your life you'll always crave a cigarette even long past your initial quitting. The thing is I can temporarily quit but whenever I'm anxious, down, mad, or simply lack will power there will always be a pack at the local store waiting for me. I just don't want to keep feeling like I've mentally overcome stoges and to even mentally celebrate just to eventually find myself back in square one. It doesn't seem like theres an end. The longest times I've been able to quit was when I had the whole new years new me type of mentality - an attitude towards drastic change in lifestyle not just in terms of smoking. But we all know how that mentally turns out, it lasts so long as there is that push of ego but as soon as that ego wears down you're back in the original state. Stoges are always the initial cause of a downard spiral into bad habits. As soon as I go back I no longer hit the gym or care about what I'm eating or bother to keep my pad tidy . And whats even worse is that if I do any of things except smoking i feel like I need to come back to it. I tried getting cheap tricks to help quit, expressions to tell myself while I'm craving, trying out different mentalities to deal with it - none of em end up working because it seems like a fundamentally deeper problem. It isn't just about stoges. Personally, if it was just one stoge in the evening to wrap up the day I might not even want to quit, but this is simply not the case. I'm starting to think that its really about physical pleasure as a whole. The only way to be free of smoking is by conquering the entirety of the physical desire. And to be honest, I'm starting to think that this isn't possible

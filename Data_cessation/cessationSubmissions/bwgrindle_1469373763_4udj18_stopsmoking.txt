6 months today

So today marks 6 months since my last smoke (more specifically at about 8:20 pm tonight but I think I'll make it).  

The first month was terrible.  I didn't leave the house for nearly a month except to go to work. And if I did I made sure my wife or kids were with me.  I can't tell you how much time I spent going out "to read" or "have alone time".  It was all to get my fix. 

I won't lie. I miss it sometimes.  It made me feel good while I was doing it.  But I'm glad I stopped.  Things are so much better.  You just don't realize how obvious it is that you are a smoker until you've stopped.  You can taste and smell things so much better. I haven't had a coughing fit since about 2 months after I stopped.  I know I'm sleeping better.

I think I'm done. Not that there isn't temptation or a craving still.  I'm sad to say I think I will always have that sneak up occasionally.  However, I know that I can beat it.  

Stopping was one of the hardest things I've done but it's also the one of the best things I've ever done.  I have gained some weight since I quit.  But I'm working out and trying to eat right again and trying to normalize myself to this new lifestyle.  

The only advice I can give is if you are trying to quit for someone else you will fail.  You have to quit for yourself.  Know that its going to suck but it will pay off.  You have to stop being a slave.  

Thanks to everyone for posting on this site. Don't give up.

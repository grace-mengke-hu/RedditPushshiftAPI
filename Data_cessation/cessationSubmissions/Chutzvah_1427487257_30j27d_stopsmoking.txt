New to the Sub and Just a General Question

Hey guys. I was referred to this sub from a post on LPT after I saw a really long comment that basically describes me. I have been smoking on and off since I started college. Now I recently graduated and one of my goals was to quit smoking. Then I work with some smokers who take their smoke breaks to kill some time. Eventually I said "I'll just have one so I can at least talk to them." Eventually it snowballed into having a few more, now I'm at a pack a week. 

I tried buying gum and replacing that, but eventually my crave wins and I'm back to square one. I drive a lot for my job and long journeys become boring and I just want a smoke to kill time. Any advice for anyone in a similar situation?

Help, I want to start smoking again

Hi, I’m 18 and smoked for 3 years, on the first of November I’ll be 6 months without smoking and about 2~ months without vaping (vaped for 4 years or so, give or take). When people smoke near me I remember the good times I had while smoking and how much I enjoyed it. I really liked it but I had to hide it from my parents. Now when I get offered one I always say no but in the inside I’m like I want oneee! I get the temptation to smoke again, I really enjoyed it, going out for a smoke with friends was great and I really enjoyed just smoking. I enjoyed it more than vaping. I have also frequent temptations to go back to vaping but I enjoyed vaping a lot less than I did smoking because when vaping I necer tasted the flavors, they were like tasteless to me so I didn’t really enjoy it as much but I did like it. Damn, I miss smoking, a lot. But it was hard to quit, not that hard because I had a JUUL, quitting that thing was fucking hard, I remember after starting to quit I was craving so much that I vaped the tiny amount left on the pods, that was hard AF. But now I get the temptation to start again. Maybe I’ll start vaping because that’s a lot less harmful than smoking and it wasn’t as hard to stop vaping 3mg, it wasn’t pleasant but not very hard. I do like not being dependant of something but I also liked vaping. It was something to do. 

I need some reassurance and tips.

Need reassurance to not start smoking again or vaping. I’m 18 smoked for 3 years vaped for 4 and quit smoking 6 months ago and vaping like 2 months ago. Tempted, very tempted to start again, mainly start vaping again at least. I do like not being dependant of something but also liked to smoke.

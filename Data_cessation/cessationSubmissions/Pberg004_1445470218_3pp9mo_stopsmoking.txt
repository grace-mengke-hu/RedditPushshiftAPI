Prepping for my first night out with my smoking friends...and alcohol ðŸ˜©

I'm 10 days in and getting ready for my first night out with my smoking friends and alcohol. I've avoided these things for as long as I can. I would skip this night out if I could, but already spent money on tickets for a show before my decision to quit. This time quitting absolutely feels different and I really contribute this to everyone on here. Any suggestions on surviving my night out with friends and booze? I'm really hoping my motivation in itself will help me survive!

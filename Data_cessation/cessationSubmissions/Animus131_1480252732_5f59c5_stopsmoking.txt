Day #5, Stress and Booze

I was too busy to write in the last few days, but I have made it to more than 5 full days since my last smoke. This may be a slightly longer entry as there are a few more things I want to talk about.

Friday was one of the most high stress days I have had in ages, and yet, the craving was not as bad as I would have thought it would be. I found myself wanting to smoke over and over, but I have adopted the approach of telling myself the following:

**"Why do you want to smoke? Because you are craving.**

**What will happen if you don't smoke? Craving goes away after about 10 minutes**

**What happens if you do smoke? Craving goes away immediately.**

**So whether you do or don't smoke, the craving will be gone in 10 minutes."**

I have this conversation with myself a few times a day when I get a craving. It has become somewhat of a mantra for me to talk myself out of wanting a cigarette. I have most definitely noticed that I am craving far less, and what I mean by less is less frequently and less intensely. 

I have found by Day #5 I have far more energy. I wake up in the morning feeling refreshed rather than cranky and tired. 

I started exercising to both cope with stress and with my extra energy.

Both Friday and Saturday night I drank alcohol for the first time since stopping. I have been stressed about this since I know how much I enjoy smoking when I drink. I am happy to say that while I was craving from time to time, I just kept having the conversation with myself over and over. I made it through 2 nights of being with people around me smoking and everyone drinking.

Thanks for reading if you have, I still don't quite know what I am trying to achieve by making these posts, but I feel somewhat compelled to do them, and it does seem to be helping so why not.

Good luck to you all.

The fear

I've been reading Allen carrs easy way and it keeps saying "if you are still smoking by the end of this book you'll be a smoker for life" I feel like this is having a bad effect on me. I can't tell if I'm scared of winning or losing. I keep putting the book down when it says these things simply  because I'm scared. I tell myself that it's because I don't want to be a smoker for the rest of my life but by putting the book down I am prolonging my time as a smoker. It's a double edged sword. Help!

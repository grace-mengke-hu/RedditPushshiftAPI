Lost the battle, but I will win the war.

This week has been a disaster. Each day I woke up and decided that today I'll make it cold turkey. I chewed tons of gum and tic tacs. I went for long walks and took naps. But every evening, the withdrawal syndrome kicked in and I started shaking, sweating and crying. And lit a cigarette.
I've read Allan Carr's book (the easy way), and some of it has got to me. And that's why I'm so confused at the moment. My mind tells to stop. I don't want to smoke. Each mercy cigarette I lit this week was terrible. But underneath my skin lies a hungry hungry monster that wants more of this poision.
So what gives? I signed up for a smoking cessation group therapy at my local clinic that starts in a few weeks. Even though I'm not nearly out of the woods, My smoking has lowered drastically this week. I'm on the same pack since sunday, and plan that it will last me for the next few days. Until the group starts, I will do my best to educate myself about quitting. Taking notes of differences between craving and habits. I will make it, by hook or by crook, and finish this addiction by my 30th birthday, in April. This is a promise to you guys, to me, and to my unborn kid.

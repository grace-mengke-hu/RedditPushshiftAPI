How do I stop eating so much?

One month in. The cravings have mostly vanished, and I'm beginning to feel like a nonsmoker. On many days, I'm not even thinking about smoking. 

BUT: I'm eating all the time. When I watch TV, I don't even really think before getting some snacks. When I eat regular meals, I overeat a lot. And I just can't seem to stop that behaviour, which is bad, because I am gaining quite a bit of weight.

I imagine lots of people have experienced similar things. Apparently my mouth just wants to be exercised. What are some techniques to get that under control? I've tried chewing gum, and lots of water, but that only works as long as I'm consciously thinking about it.

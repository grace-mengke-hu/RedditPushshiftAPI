Can someone please help me get my mind straight?

I hate smoking. 

No one else in my life smokes and they would all be super supportive if I decided to quit. 

In the "macro", I know how dangerous and expensive it is. I have coughing fits, cough up brown grossness, and sometimes feel soreness in my lungs. Despite the fact that I used to be an athlete, I now run out of breath walking up stairs. 

I am embarrassed to smoke. I try to hide it from everyone but they all know. I quit before and was smoke-free for years but...  now I've been smoking again for the last few. 

The problem is the "micro" decisions that are made daily. Despite all of the above, I find myself wanting to have another smoke. I always put off quitting till next week. I always seem to allow myself the exception of the next one. 

How can I make a permanent change?  What can I do to overcome my daily weakness to get it more in line with my overall hatred of smoking?

Please help. This has to stop.

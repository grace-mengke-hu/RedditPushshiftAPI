Today is the day!!!

Hi everyone! I just finished Allen Carrs book and today is the day!  As of 8pm (3+ hours ago) I'm a non-smoker! Yahoo!  I'm so happy and excited to start this journey! God this feels good, what a gigantic weight lifted off of me!  I just wanted to share and mark this moment somehow.  Thanks!

Possible to get withdrawal from only a few days of smoking cigarettes?

A few months ago I went to Mexico for spring break and I more or less threw caution to the wind and decided to try a bunch of different shit while I was there. I ended up juuling a whole bunch and smoking about 2 packs of cigarettes. After I left I haven’t touched nicotine at all, but I do notice that I’ve been more anxious and sleepy since then. Didn’t think much of it as I’ve had a lot of stuff going on in life. Last night though, I hit my friends juul and I felt 1 million times better about everything for about 10 seconds. My high (I smoked some weed) was instantly better and I felt so fucking relaxed like I hadn’t been for months. Did I give myself an addiction to nicotine and was I going through withdrawal or am I just a stupid college kid? I feel like my body could finally stop being so jumpy and anxious after the juul, so it’s making me kinda nervous as to whether it’s just the juul itself or my untreated “addiction” to nicotine. I have no desire to keep smoking cigarettes or juuling so how would I go about making sure I can get rid of this feeling towards nicotine?

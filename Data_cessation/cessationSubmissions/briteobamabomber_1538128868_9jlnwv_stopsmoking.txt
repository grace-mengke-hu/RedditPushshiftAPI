im sorry if this post doesnt fit here

will delete right away if this isnt relevant to anyone , but i take “poppers” (tobacco/weed in a bong) daily. right when i wake up and right before i go to sleep and all throughout the day i used to smoke a pack every 1-2 days on top of this ive since completely quit smoking but still cannot quit the poppers, down to about a pack a week sometimes 2 weeks but i can’t quit the poppers for the life of me. no matter how hard i try my subconscious will find a way to justify it and im right back to square one. does anyone have any suggestions? very open minded at this point im just so fucking sick of waking up and coughing in the morning, its gotten to the point where theres black in my phlegm  sometimes and ive lost quite a bit of weight in the last year i never have any appetite whatsoever i eat a meal a day and after that im forcing down everything else i have no motivation and im always so depressed i just want to be healthy

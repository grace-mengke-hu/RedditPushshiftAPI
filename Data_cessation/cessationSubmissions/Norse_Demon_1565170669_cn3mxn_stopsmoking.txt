Waking up gasping for breath after quitting? No history of sleep apnea.

**Problem:** Jolting awake either at night or especially very close to falling asleep for a nap because I can't breathe. It's like I'm literally drowning in slime in my throat. It is gross as all hell, just as it sounds like, and it takes a good while until I can breathe again because neither coughing nor swallowing do anything at first. Happens maybe three or four times a week.  


**Why I'm asking:** This is weirding me right out because I can't find descriptions of this same problem. I see several variations of insomnia, shortness of breath, and apneic symptoms but I can't find this one. It started right as I began my first quitting attempt so it definitely feels related. The longest I've been able to go without smoking so far has been four months and it didn't stop during that time. No other breathing-related problems are present. Insomnia remains a constant companion though, with or without these drowning sensations. Never had any other apneic problems. I'm 34, very fit and slightly underweight so not the typical profile for sleep apnea in the general sense.  


**Questions:** Has anyone experienced this? Did it ever stop? Do I need to grab myself one of those breathing mask apparatuses from a doctor? *Is this a job for a shrink rather than a doc?*

Day 6 - Now it's just a mind game

So I am at Day 6 going Cold Turkey.  I bought an e-cigarette starter kit prior to my quit thinking it would help ease the transition.  I still haven't had to use it.  I've tried quitting before (25 years @ 1-2 packs a day) but never could get very far.  This time it seems so different.  I don't know why it seems so much easier but it does.  I know I have to stay on guard and especially watch to not be having beers on the weekend which would immediately cause me to go buy "just one pack" at the store.  

I wanted to make a list of the reasons I am sticking with this and the more I thought about it the longer that list got.  I really surprised myself.  

I've been lurking for a while here and the many posts have helped me so I thought I'd share my list and maybe it can help encourage people to stick with their own quit.

1.  My mortality (and at 41 that feeling of being bullet-proof is disappearing)
2.  My 2 year old daughter who I don't want to leave alone before I absolutely have to
3.  My wife and our soon-to-be 2nd baby.  Cutting my lifespan by smoking is a damned selfish thing to do to them.
4.  I got a hug from a friend the other day who smokes.  I honestly couldn't believe the smell (and how it hung on me for so long too)
5.  About $65/week PLUS no smoking = less of my "smoking trigger" - beer.  So let's call it an even $100.
6.  If I can stay clean then I can get life insurance that isn't a Kings Ransom.
7.  Not ending up like my Dad - who was the smartest and best father I could ever ask for.  Had an iron-will and loved his family more than anything but just couldn't kick the habit.  Died of cancer at 71.
8.  Maybe I won't be huffing and puffing when I do work on the house.  

Even as I am typing this at the end of my work day, I want to go home and crack a beer or two and light up.  I know I can't and it helps to know there are so many people in the same boat with me.

Good luck everyone!

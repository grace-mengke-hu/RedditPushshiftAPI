30 Days to Quitting Smoking - Day 1

Hey r/stopsmoking

I'm on my 2nd day now, just over 40 hours! Still a long way to go, but I wanted to post this here to make you guys my accountability partners. 

If you're interested in some of my techniques for the first day (I plan on posting throughout the 30) you can check them out at:

Not trying to self-promote, just looking for people to keep me going. I figure the more people I tell, the more I'll be committed to being successful. 

I think after the 30 days I'll stop having the cravings or very very rarely get them. What do you guys think? This isn't my first attempt... I've been smoking for about 14 years but I want to make this my final go. 

Cheers!

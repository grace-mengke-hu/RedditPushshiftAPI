Approaching day 3, is to normal to feel "empty" after quitting?

In a little over 3 hours it will have been 72 hours since my last smoke. I have been fighting the cravings, but even when I don't even feel like smoking, I still have this "empty" feeling.. like I lost something important.

Did anyone else experience this/is this normal?

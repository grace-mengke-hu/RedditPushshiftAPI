Going to try again

I tried quitting last Monday, made it two days and then found out a friend passed away and lost my courage.  I want to quit.  My husband is 36 and had Huntington's disease so I am always pretty stressed out.  I need to be healthy as I am full time caregiver to him now.  I NEED to quit so bad.  I have patches, gum and an ecigarette.  Any tips would be great!

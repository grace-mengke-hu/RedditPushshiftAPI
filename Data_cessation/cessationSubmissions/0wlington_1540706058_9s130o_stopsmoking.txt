Had my last smoke at 10:00am. It's 4pm now. Starting to feel jittery.

Relapsed to snaking again about 6 months ago after quitting for a couple of years. Trying to kick it again. Still feeling positive at the moment, but starting to get the itch. I think I'm going to document my journey on here as a way of coping. Is that ok to do?

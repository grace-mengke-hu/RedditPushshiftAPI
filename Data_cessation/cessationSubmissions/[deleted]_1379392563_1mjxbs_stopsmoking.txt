climbed kilimanjaro, didn't make it to the top. guide said quit smoking.

of the 5 of us who climbed, only i smoked.  i stopped a day before the climb but throughout the adventure, i was the 2nd slowest (the slowest just wasn't mentally or physically ready).  it was a bit embarassing to see the 2 other guys keep up every single day while i panted along with the 2 girls.  
by the time we got close to a peak, the 2 guys got hit hard with altitude sickness and hypothermia.  the slowest girl was barely slugging it through, and one girl and i trucked it to the peak with all the mental strength we had left to push.  we made it and had our moments, then descended back to camp where the guide suggested i quit smoking.  i was already 6 days clean by then and decided to just keep going.  

today i am 3 days short of 1 month, acne breakouts and all.  during that time, i had half a smoke that just made me gag but because i took it from the bartender, i did not want to kill it in front of him out of courtesy.  used to say cold turkey doesn't work, so shocked that i am following through and hope this isn't too difficult.  have already teased friends into giving me smokes while under the influence and cursed them for actually not thinking twice abt supporting my quitting.  
this is probably my 5th and most succesful attempt by miles.  no gum or patches required either.  
    me supports^all of you !

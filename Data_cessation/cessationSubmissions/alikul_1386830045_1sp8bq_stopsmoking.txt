Feel like spikes are pushed thru my heart, with EACH cigarrette.

Literally, I've been having these pains in the heart area for a while now, and I'm noticing they tend to start/hurt more each time i light one up. My cardiologist said firstly I NEED TO STOP SMOKING, then concentrate on getting fit and healthy (obese 40stick/day smoker with 0 physical activity). That guy's 70 years old and runs 10km/day DANG ! I've recently purchased a ecig starter kit and, given the high nic dosage, I don't feel that HUGE urge for a normal cig that i usually do. Also the heart pains are virtually gone.

So I ordered a badge from thy badgebot. So I finally got that going... which is nice... 

Hi, stopsmoking, I'm Alex ! How U doin' ?

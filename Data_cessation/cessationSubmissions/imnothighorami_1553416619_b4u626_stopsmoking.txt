Im 17 and smoke occasionally i want to stop but i just cant refuse a cigarette

Im actually petrified of dieing and i hope the damage hsnt been done but i seriously just dont want to smoke anymore but i cant help myself. Im asthmatic and every smoke i regret but i just cant stop and alot of my social group smoke and i smoke at parties when im drunk and stuff like that. Any tips?

Wearing white shirts

A pretty stupid incentive, sure, but it feels good to wear a white shirt without worrying if I'll get ash on it. I've been wearing a light jacket in the car over my work clothes, which SUCKS IN GEORGIA WEATHER. So yeah, I'm clinging to whatever helps me not smoke, and today - day one - it's ash free white clothes.

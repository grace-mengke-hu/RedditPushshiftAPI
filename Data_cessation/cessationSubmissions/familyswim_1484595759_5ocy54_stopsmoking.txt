Quitting Dip Changed My Emotions?

I have gone cold turkey from tobacco. This will mark about a week and a half, and emotionally I feel so much more connected. Before I felt disconnected from people, and had to think about how relationships worked. Now it feels real. I haven't felt this emotionally attached to people and my friends in so long.

The first few days were absolute hell. I would workout everyday and have to sit in a pool, hottub, and steam to make myself feel better. It was peaceful but I felt such terrible withdrawal symptoms. The water seemed relaxing and helped take the stress off, and the steam made me feel like I was cleansing myself. I was restless and sleeping 13 hours a day,(I usually sleep about 7.5-9), awful headaches every day, tired all the time, and had huge food cravings.

What could be the possible cause of the emotional change? Is it in my head, or how nicotine had been affecting my brain? I was dipping once a day with some days binging half a can a day if I was stressed or had work. I know this is a stop smoking subreddit but the stopchewing sub has fewer people, and it is tobacco. Thanks for the replies, hope to keep up and quit for the rest of my life. I was on and off dipping for two years, then became a regular for the next 3.

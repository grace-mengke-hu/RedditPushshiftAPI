Failed once on Carr's Easy Way to Quit. Advice?

I'm just posting this in case anyone out there has gone through something similar. I'm betting on it.

Last year I quit for over a month, my longest quit thus far. And I attribute a lot of that success to going through The Easy Way. After a few instances of (drunken)weakness I fell back to square one. While attempting to quit later that year I only every lasted a few days.

There might be a number of other reasons I was able to last that long: I was more broke then, and I'm not now. 
And I was discouraged with falling back to square one. Either way, I'd appreciate any advice. I'm sick of cigarettes.

I am Weak.

Hi, 23 year old male here. Smoker since 5 years now. Just a casual smoker with 3-4 cigarettes a day. My problem is that I have relapsed 5th time now after quitting for three months. I read allen carr every time I relapse and usually quit a month after finishing it. It's just that there is something I can't still figure out yet that draws me back to to smoking. I made my first quit attempt after I started going to the gym. Started feeling great and amazing. But relapsed yet again. Didn't stop going to the gym, but I do have on off months of cigarettes. Maybe I don't love my life that much or something, but if you people could just help me figure out the last bit. Thanks folks.

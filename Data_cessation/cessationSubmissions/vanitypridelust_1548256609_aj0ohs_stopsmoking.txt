Did quitting screw up anyone else's menstrual cycle?

I know nicotine can affect hormone levels, so I assume that between that and the stress it's probably related, but right now I'm about 4 days late (despite very much **not** being pregnant). I've been getting cramping and some PMS symptoms for about a week now but my period hasn't actually started and it's super annoying. 

Is it normal for your cycle to go wonky when you stop smoking?

It really is a decision you make every day.

Hello /r/StopSmoking , I have been a lurker for some time and decided to share my experiences. 

Started smoking in college and stopped 4 years later. I quit probably 25 times before I’ve made it on a streak this long. (3 months approx) I couldn’t bring myself to set another marker or else I’d be checking it too much. Every day smoking is top of mind in the morning, at lunch, on my drive, everywhere and I want to know: Does it get easier to not think of? 

I come from a family of ex-smokers and they all say that you lose interest in doing it. I wouldn’t say I’ve ever thought less about it or lost interest but it is easier to say NO. Is that what they meant? 

I quit for my girlfriend (I know I should quit for me) but for some reason I don’t care enough to do it for myself. I think there’s a bunch of red flags in what I just typed that suggest relapse but it is nice to not have to step out all the time! 

This was very sporadic but I just need a sounding board for all of my thoughts. Does any of this make sense?

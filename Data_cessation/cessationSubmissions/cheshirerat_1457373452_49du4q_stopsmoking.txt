Guys for real, how the hell do you do this?

So I need to quit,  but I kind of don't want to I enjoy smoking, I've sort of given it a go the last couple days on an experimental basis, lasted several hours before saying "screw it I'll try later". Any tips, tricks,  whatever? Is worth noting I'm not a fan of people so support system is kind of a no go and I'm trying it cold turkey. 

Edit: gave it a go, lasted 28 hours before shit got stupid.  I know more now and I think with a little more motivation I could actually quit. But for now I'm gonna go buy a pack and. Try and feel better.

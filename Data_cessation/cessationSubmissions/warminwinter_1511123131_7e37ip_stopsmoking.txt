Another benefit of quitting - Employer sponsored life insurance. I am no longer a tobacco user.

I was able to change my tobacco status to "non tobacco user"  a few weeks ago on my employer sponsored life insurance.  Rates were cut in half.  In signing up for next year's benefits, I could proudly check the box "non tobacco user" and will have the benefit of the lower rates throughout 2018.  Just sharing another benefit of kicking the cigarette habit.

The first day of 2015 is my 100th day since smoking!

100 days off the smokes thanks to this sub and vaping.
I know a lot of you don't like vaping, but like a lot of people I've been cutting down the nicotine content gradually and the plan is to get rid of it eventually. But for now I'm just glad to be off the smellies!

1 Week today- never thought I'd make it

Today is one week since I had my last cigarette. I never thought I'd ever go a week let alone a day without a cigarette. But now there is absolute no going back and I'm really happy about it. Some things I've learned over this week:

1 - The pure habit of it is my biggest issue. I still find myself getting up in the morning and making coffee and heading over to my balcony to go smoke. And I just have to remind myself that i'm not a smoker anymore and how good of a thing that is.

2 - I don't know if this is a common thing but I've now had smoking dreams. Where I've bought a pack of cigarettes but ended up not smoking them. 

3 - The real physical cravings are gone which is crazy to me, but it's also fantastic. The only time I really get cravings is when I'm either very stressed or very excited about something. Times when I'd normally reach for a cigarette. 

4 - Smelling other people smoke makes you want to smoke instinctively but also helps remind you how bad you smell and why you should not smoke. 

5 - Taste and smell has improved DRASTICALLY in the past week, even on day 2/3. 

Trying to stay strong and fight off any cravings I might have, but I'm looking forward to seeing any more positive effects quitting smoking will have on my life going forward in the next few weeks/months.

Thanks to all of you for the motivation and support. This community has definitely been an amazing tool thus far.

Sleeping and dental issues post-quit

Nine days and 11h in, feeling pretty good, except: 

1) I have trouble falling asleepand I fidget during the night. I can't say I've never gone through periods where it took forever to get to sleep, but I always used to sleep through the night with no problem whatsoever.  I use the 16h patch but take it off before lying down for the night.

2) I've developed a toothache and gum swelling in an area that I suspect has a cavity. So beware, new and future quitters - you may develop some dental discomfort if you already have some underlying issues that were unresolved...

Any tips from more experienced former smokers on these two problems? Should I take the patch off earlier? (e.g. a couple of hours before I want to fall asleep) Or should I just wait this out until it resolves itself?  Should I brace myself for even more dental problems or other surprises from my body?  (I've already scheduled a long procrastinated dental appointment).

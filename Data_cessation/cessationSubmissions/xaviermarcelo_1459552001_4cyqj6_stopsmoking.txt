How do I convince my friend to stop smoking?

 I have this friend who is very dear to me and he started smoking and i'm very concerned. We are young he started two weeks ago I think and I really want him to stop because, in my opinion it's not good for him, just an addiction it wont bring him happiness. i'm amazed he even started because he was always 100% against it, he even said once he never understood why people smoke. i haven't even tried yet to convince him to stop, what should i tell him? i don't know if i should be a little harsh or not, because i still have to respect his choice no matter what and i don't want to hurt his feelings. he said he was going to stop but i really don't know, I've seen a lot of people saying that and then re-starting again. The only person i know it stopped smoking completely is my dad but that's because i was 6 years old and i convinced him to stop, i think he did because he saw it as a bad example.
 I'm scared too because he might do something else that may harm him and i don't want that to happen.
 I'm sad and angry because this really hurts me, to see someone you care going this path. he may not feel much about it but it hurts those around who care for him
 I need advice please and i wont stop trying to convince him to stop amoking, unless he tells me hes happy that way

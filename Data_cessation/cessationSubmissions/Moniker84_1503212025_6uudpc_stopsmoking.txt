Must resist the urge...

..but the pull to cave in and smoke is just so strong that I think I might go throw away my husband's cigarettes. (Haha boy would he be bent tomorrow) I want to smoke so bad right now.  Not a single distracting trick is working for me.  I am having such a hard time tonight knowing that a smoke is so easily accessible to me...  Just one won't hurt.  Fukk the dang nicotine demon.

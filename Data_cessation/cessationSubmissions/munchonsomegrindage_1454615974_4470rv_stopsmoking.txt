Three years and no looking back

I hardly ever post on here and never really made a big show to my friends or family of how long it's been, because I never wanted to make a big deal of it. I was a smoker and a dipper and after years of wanting to quit I finally quit one, then the other, and then only got through about half a pack of Nicorette before I threw those out and really started concentrating on fitness. It was Super Bowl 3 years ago that I had my last cigarette. It seemed pretty easy at the time (even though there were definitely some difficult times) but looking back it was a huge deal. The best decision I ever made and the best decision I continue to make. If you're quitting now or long ago I encourage you to stay strong and realize how great of a decision you're making. Continue to be the best version of you that you can be.

Day Four -- wow this is hard!!

I'm on Day Four cold turkey and damn!! Hardly slept last night. When I did I had terrible dreams. 

It hasn't weakened my resolve and I know it will be worth it. But yeah this is pretty brutal! 

My quit day was a day I had some dental work done, so that's been a constant reminder of a good reason I'm doing this. 

I quit drinking last year so I definitely have the tools I need, but this is definitely a very different experience for me. Much more frequent cravings. 

I can handle it!! I'm not smoking with you all today :)

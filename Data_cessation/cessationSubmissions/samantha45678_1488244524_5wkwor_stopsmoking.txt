Feels like a revelation!!

So I'm on day 32'and I've had that feeling people talk about! Like a dawning realisation that I'm a none smoker, the main difference is this; I don't feel like it's been a chore. It's just a different mindset that I wish I'd have known to look out for before. My whole attitude when giving up hundreds of times in the past was like "oh it's not fair, I'm so jealous of smokers, I'll have to smoke in summer when I'm on holiday and I can't wait". It almost wasn't a permanent decision and I always felt as though I was missing out. I now understand that difference and feel completely the opposite.

What weird is I can see it with other people too, when I read through these posts I can blatantly see the attitude of others and almost predict how they're going to do. I don't mean judge anyone, heck I've been there many times but when you have that mindset that's it's going to be hell etc it doesn't work! It's like setting yourself up to fail. I set off on champix which was probably the main switcher of my attitude because I literally couldn't enjoy smoking so I accepted sooner that it wasn't an option to start again, unlike other times I've tried! 

I'm not going to say "stay positive" blah blah because I don't think it's so much a conscious thing but what I am saying is don't give up giving up! Keep trying until one day that mindset just clicks.
Its taken me over 15 years but I've done it and I can say that with confidence this time, I've done it!

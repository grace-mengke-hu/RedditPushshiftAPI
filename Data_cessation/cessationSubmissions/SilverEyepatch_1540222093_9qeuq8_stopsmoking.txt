[21 M] 5 days quitting, feeling very rough/sad

I know it doesn't seem long but I've been smoking for 6 months. For the first 2 or so months it was just borrowing 1-2 a day from a friend and gradually as the weeks/months went on it turned into me buying my own packs and smoking up to 10-12 a day... I made the commitment 5 days ago to try my very hardest to quit and so far I've had some success. I threw away everything that could trigger me and instead switched over to a e-pen and patches. 

I've been cutting my patches in half so I'm currently at 10.5mg every 24 hours and I've ordered some vape juices, one with 6mg strength and the other two with 12mg. As I said I've been doing okay by just vaping and applying patches but when I do get the cravings for a proper cigarette it really makes me feel like shit. 

Some of the main reasons I quit besides my health was my granda dying from lung cancer, my girlfriend telling me she's scared of the future if I keep smoking, and in general just having the horrible sinking feeling that I HAD to have a cigarette. My birthday is next Saturday and a  lot of my friends socially smoke so I'm already anxious to even attend my own birthday party I...

Todayoughest out of the lot and I guess I just wanted to share my experience with you guys and maybe get some helpful words/advice.

I'm not absolutely sure what strength  patches /juices I should be using. As well as that I've sat and read through Alan carrs stop smoking book, although helpful it's also planted a feeling in my mind that if I do feel a craving or do end up slipping up I am in fact nothing but a failure....

My teeth feel so clean.

I did notice the stains to my teeth while I smoked, but after a week of not smoking, My teeth and whole mouth feels incredibly clean. 

It sounds kind of silly, but this came as a pleasant surprise. Normally people talk about the lung/heart health benefits, but I am thoroughly enjoying my clean teeth.

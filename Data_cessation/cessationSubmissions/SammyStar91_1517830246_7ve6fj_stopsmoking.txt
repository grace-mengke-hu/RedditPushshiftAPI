Quitting with e-cigs?

Does anyone have any experience quitting smoking using e-cigs? I've just ordered one yesterday, my bf is still not happy about it as he says I'm still smoking so not actually quitting, but after research it suggests it's 95% less harmful than cigarettes so surely there is some benefit? 

To note, I'm not planning on using an e-cig long term, this is just something in the interim to get me off cigarettes basically. Rather than quitting cold turkey. I have done it in the past, and maintained it for around 4 years after quitting cold turkey, I'm just not in a great place mentally right now and don't have the will power to stop all together, but know I need to for my health.

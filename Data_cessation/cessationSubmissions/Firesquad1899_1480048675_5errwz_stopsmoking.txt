why am i getting depression spikes..

Hello! im 17, been a slave of cigarettes, been 4 years but i smoked like 3-4 times a week, two-4 cigs a week then it got up,  but i quit a lot of bad habits cause i finally decided i cant let anything control me, i quit cold turkey for sure this time, its been 3 weeks today no headaches no withdrawal symptoms, no cravings.. all the times i quit i always had symptoms and cravings but these 3 weeks, im chasing my dreams so bad that i dont get any cravings nor symptoms but yesterday and today i had random depression strikes.. like depression for no reason.. is this normal? depression even though i know i quit nd dont need cigs anymore..

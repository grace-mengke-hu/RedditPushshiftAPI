Nearly three weeks without nicotine

Greetings. The hubs and I have decided to quit smoking, and it's been nearly three weeks. We're coping relatively well, but oh my word. The irritableness. The munchies. We're both getting annoyed at little things far more easily than we used to. We know why, but we've snapped at each other more over the last few days than we have all year...Wish us luck please?

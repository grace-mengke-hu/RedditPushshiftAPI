A friend passed away

A good friend, long time heavy smoker, passed away last week at 47.  He has a wife and two young sons.  His son found him.  Now, I'm no doctor and I cannot say smoking caused his heart attack, but this was a wake up call.  I think of the good times we had together and how we would share cigarettes and take breaks at work together and I can't help but connect the dots.  I will never smoke again, I don't even have the desire to anymore.  Monday 6/19 will be two weeks and the weird thing is that I quit on the day he died and I didn't find out about his death until two days later.  I will miss him, but not as much as his family will and I never want my husband or son to go through losing me to smoking.  The urges still creep up and every time I want to smoke I think of him and the urge is just gone.  I don't want to die.

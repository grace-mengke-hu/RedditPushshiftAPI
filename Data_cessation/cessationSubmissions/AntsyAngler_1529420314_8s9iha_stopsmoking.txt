3 weeks, and a job interview. Feeling Good!

I'm happy to have 3 weeks on no nicotine, smoking, vaping etc.  I had a job interview yesterday that lasted for 2 hours.  It would have been torture to endure if I had not quit smoking or if I was still going through the first week of not smoking.  I know I would not be considered if I had shown up smelling of cigarettes.  

Still, there were some triggering moments.  Especially leading up to the interview, when I was feeling nervous.  But after the interview I felt on top of the world.  Later, I walked by a bar and folks were outside smoking.  I had a split second when I thought about how I used to drink and smoke and how "old me" would be out on that patio smoking and drinking to celebrate a good interview.  But "new me" knows better and I went to buy a lovely mocha with whipped cream and walk around in my little bubble of self satisfaction for a brief time at least.  

Anyway, I just had to share with you guys.  It's getting better and the pay offs are huge.  Screw cigarettes.  I don't want 'em in my life.

Welbutrin and the Early Stages of Quitting

My insurance doesn't cover Chantix, so my doctor put me on 150mg of Welbutrin. My withdrawal hasn't been bad. I've been using the "Smokefree" app and it lead me here. I'm suppose to read ten posts on the early stages of quitting. I decided to write one to hopefully helps someone in my spot. Ive been a smoker for my entire adult life. It's a terrible habit. I've quit so many times that it felt like a joke that I even concidered quitting again. Knowing that I'm never touching another cigarette in my life is hard to comprehend. There are no "cheat days" "social smoking" or anything of the sort. Just me and my willpower. I haven't touched a cigarette since my quit date. I feel great. The Welbutrin takes the edge off significantly. When my smoking triggers hit, I am able to let the cravings pass. There are so many reasons to quit. My main reason is to not feed into Big Tabacco and line the pockets of those fat cats who make millions off of killing people. I'm not going to kill myself anymore with a useless habit. It's not a stress reliever, it's not a way to relax. Its a waste of money and time. So, happy trails to quitting. Good for you, I hope you make it. :)

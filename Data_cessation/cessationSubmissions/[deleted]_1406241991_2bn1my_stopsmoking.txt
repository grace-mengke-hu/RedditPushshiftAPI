I believe that I won.

I can't remember the last time that I craved a cigarette. I no longer have outbursts of anger. Rarely do I feel sad at all anymore. I believe that I've kicked this habit once, and for all, and it makes me so glad to know this. I've never felt so good in my entire life. How I wish I could have stopped smoking sooner or better yet never started at all, but oh well. For those of you trying to quit(or have quit) I want to let you know that I am proud of you, and to never give up. No matter how many times you relapse just keep at it. Eventually you will overcome your addiction or control it at least. Thank you for reading, and I wish you good luck on your journey.

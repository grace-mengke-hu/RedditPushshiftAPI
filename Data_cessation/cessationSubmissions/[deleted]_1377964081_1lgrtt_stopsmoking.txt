When will it stop??????????

I read Alan Carr's book, I've turned down any smoking for days (I did use a blunt for my weed a few weeks ago, but that's it, only weed) yet I still cannot stop dreaming about smoking.

I've had at least 15 dreams over the past 40 days that I can remember and I'm sure I've had tons of others.

Last night again, I dreamed that I was smoking a pack of cigarettes with a friend. I chain smoked a full pack and then picked up a cigar and felt really guilty.

When do these dreams stop? They are so vivid and realistic that I have to double take when I wake up.

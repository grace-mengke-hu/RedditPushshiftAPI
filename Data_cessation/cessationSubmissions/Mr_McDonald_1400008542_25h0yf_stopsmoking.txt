2 days down!

Had my last smoke two days ago. Needed to quit because I had my wisdom teeth taken out and I decided that would be a good time to give it a shot. 

So far so good I must say. A small craving here and there but nothing too extreme. After 6 years of a pack a day I'm feeling pretty good about this.

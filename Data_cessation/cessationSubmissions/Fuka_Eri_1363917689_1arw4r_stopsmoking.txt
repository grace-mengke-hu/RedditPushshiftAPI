Anyone else miss the camaraderie? 

Today as my coworker was going out for a smoke break, she said, "I really miss stooping it with you."  (stooping it = our word for smoking)  And I said to her, "I don't. I'm free!" That was a small victory for me but I got to thinking later that I do miss the chatting we would do. Oh well... At least I'm free.

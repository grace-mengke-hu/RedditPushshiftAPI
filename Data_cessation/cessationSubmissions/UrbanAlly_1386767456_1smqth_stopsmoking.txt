Constant cold and coughing up horrible stuff

Stopped smoking cigars a few weeks ago, I stopped cigarettes years ago. I smoked maybe 5 a day , inhaling them as they were pretty weak but still probably stronger than normal smokes. 

Stopped for a while before however I just hear about too many people dieing of smoking related illnesses ! 

Read the easy way and it sure helped ! 

I have had a constant cough with mucus and thick horrible stuff for the last couple of weeks. Every winter I suffer badly with sinus problems and reckon it is to do with smoking ! 

I am never going back !

Saturday Night's Alright...

Those are the toughest.. having a beer with some friends or even sitting out by the campfire by myself.... Last night was a tough one. However, instead of smoking I came in here and read a few posts about others struggles. Instead of lighting up, I offered words of encouragement to others, hopefully enlightening them. Thank you for this sub! It's given me a tool to refocus my energy when times get tough...

Third week down.. Next stop... **ONE MONTH**

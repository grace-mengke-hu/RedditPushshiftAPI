The dream is over

It's been over 300 days now. Last night I smoked 2 cigarettes. I am so disappointed with myself, I feel like I have lost control, I've resigned myself to being a smoker again. I'm going to finish this pack, buy another one and another and another and another one. I'm a smoker again, this vicious cycle is reborn.

Or so I thought, it was all a dream. These fucking dreams. I woke up this morning to the realisation that none of that happened, that I had "another chance".

I thought the dreams were over, I had a few "smoking dreams" early on, but it's been many months since I've had one. I didn't realise that it was a dream until a couple of minutes after I had woken up, I was dozing around the first couple of minutes of my morning with the shame, guilt and disappointment of being a smoker again.

I'm glad I had this dream, I'm glad my brain is fucking with me. It further reinforces my will and desire to remain a non-smoker. The disappointment I had in myself was so deep, I felt like such a failure. I don't want to feel like that, I want to keep this feeling of accomplishment.


Not one puff, not one drag, not one smoke. I can't have just one, one is all it will take to get me back to being a full time smoker again. I can't do that, I am a recovering tobacco/nicotine junkie.

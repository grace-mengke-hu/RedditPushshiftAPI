A word of warning

I had quit smoking last Sunday and stopped for 6 days, my longest quit yet, which is not good because that's not very long. I was smoking joints every day after work to try and null the cravings and it worked quite well I found. The downside to this method was that every time I started craving cigarettes I would want to smoke a joint instead because I got to smoke SOMETHING. It helped with the nicotine dependence aspect but did nothing at all to quell the want to SMOKE. The mental aspect in my opinion was stronger than the physical one and this is what I have to focus on for the next one. I had commented on some posts that smoking weed was helpful but in the long run I don't think it's going to help me. I have to go cold turkey on all things smoke to beat this. Good luck everybody and keep up the good fight.

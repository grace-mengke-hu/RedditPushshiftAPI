66 days baby!

When i felt that the little cig demon was squashed (i'd say on day 30) i felt so empowered. I felt like nothing was impossible, that i could do anything i set my mind to. so i decided to take on my porn addiction. i realized it was serious because i replaced my smoking habit with even more porn than i'd typically watch (usually once a day, escalated to 2+). so here i am, relapsed once after 19 days. i'm currently on day 10.
i'm going for the nofap 90 day challenge and it is fucking difficult. this sort of addiction varies greatly in terms of recovery; depending on when you started, frequency, etc. it can be anywhere from 2 weeks to 5 months before you're back to normal, and it's looking like i may be closer to the latter end of that spectrum. But i can do it. Goddammit, i will do it. i'm looking at my stopsmoking badge right now and it gives me power. And thanks to everyone on this sub who helped me through it as well. 

To anyone who's in the thick of it right now, it gets so much better. Soon you'll get through the shittiness, and you'll be so much better for it. your health, wealth, your spirit will all see improvements, and hopefully it will motivate you to keep improving. Take care everyone.

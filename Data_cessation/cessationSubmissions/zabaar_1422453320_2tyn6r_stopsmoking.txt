Day 4 of no cigarettes. Many, many valleys but there is still light.

  Been close to 100 days since I broke up with my girlfriend. The break up was terrible. It revealed my inner self too, who I was. It is true they say a crisis shows the real you. I found the real me after the break up. I hated myself badly.

  I smoked a ~7-8 sticks before I quit. Compared to most of you here it's a tiny amount. Still, I am having cravings, many cravings. Just yesterday my friend offered me a cigarette (he wasn't aware yet that I was trying to quit) and damn, it was tempting.

  The reason why I am quitting is mostly because I want to have some control in my life. I don't know, but I find myself losing control over many aspects of my life. This is no doubt the worst period in my life. I never felt this way before, and never knew myself this truthfully before.

   The amount of hatred I bear towards myself is unhealthy and that is another thing I have to work on. I cry many times a day, ruminating about my past mistakes and at the person I am. The future looks like shit to me. I have distanced myself away from most of my friends and really it is something I know I shouldn't do but I just feel so dark.

  Anyway, yeah. Hopefully along with the journey of quitting cigarettes, I will learn more about discipline, and grow as a person.

  The past four days I have exercised one way or another. So there is some good in life! Honestly, I can't see the fucking light at the end of the tunnel and I don't believe the rain is ever going to end. Still, I want to persist. At least for 21 days (my initial goal). 

  Thanks for reading. I just wanted to share this. 

  To the rest of you out there who are trying to quit, all the best. I guess what really helped me so far is telling myself not to find any excuses. Not coming up with some bullshit excuse for a smoke. And telling myself DISCIPLINE DISCIPLINE DISCIPLINE. 

  Have a great day ahead!

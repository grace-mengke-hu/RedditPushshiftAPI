Quitting with Patch, looking for feedback

I just want to know for those who have successfully or unsuccessfully quit using the patch ..... how long were you on it, and how did you ween. I don't want to go according to the instructions.

I've been on 14mg patch for 5 days (with sleeping)...and am doing great. I want to do 1 week 14 and drop down to 7mg...see how that goes then drop again. 

I know everyone is different, but I'm curious what worked or ended up failing for ppl who tried the patch method.

Appreciate your feedback.

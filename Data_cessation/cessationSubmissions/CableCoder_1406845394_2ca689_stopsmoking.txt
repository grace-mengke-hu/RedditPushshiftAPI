1.5 days in - surprisingly still feel motivated

I've tried to quit before, but it was never my top priority.  Those attempts usually faltered because I would 'treat' myself with a cigar, or a bowl of weed after going all day without smoking.  I realize now how destructive that mentality was to my efforts.  
  
Yesterday was the first day in 10 years I went without smoking anything.  No cigarettes, no weed, no vaporizers, no cigars.  It's hard for sure.  I had a panic attack yesterday from the stress of it coupled with the stress of work.  I think I'm having Dopamine fluctuations due to no weed.  My emotions are all over the place, **but I did it**  
  
I made it a day and a half without smoking, and I'm not going to break that streak for anything.  
   
Aside:  
I now realize how all my clothes stink of stagnant cigarette smoke.  Gotta get some new clothes with all the money I'm saving.

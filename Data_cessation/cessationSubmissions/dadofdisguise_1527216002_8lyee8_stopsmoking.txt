A pack a day for 30 years. Four days smoke free, yes!

I never comment but I've been following this sub for several months and have enjoyed reading everyone's success stories. In a few minutes, I will hit four days without a smoke. Not much time compared to everyone on here, but i feel so good for starting this quit.  Been smoking a least a pack a day for roughly 30 years. I'm so tired of coughing, gagging, choking and generally feeling like crap. I need this to work and am giving it 100 percent. Cravings haven't been too bad but I'm  eating anything I can get my hands on. Just had to share with someone, friends and coworkers couldn't care less and I know you folks will understand. Good luck to my fellow quitters, we can do this!

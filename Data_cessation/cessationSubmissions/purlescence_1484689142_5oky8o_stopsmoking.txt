Had to reset my badge

Made it to just about 6 months. Starting smoking one or two cigarettes with friends and family over the holidays. By New Year's Day, I was buying a pack every two-three days.

It's easier this time around in that I've been through cold turkey before and know that the cravings will subside soon.

It's harder this time around in that I have to tell myself I'll never take another drag, ever, at all. I know now that I can't be that social smoker who takes one and then leaves it alone. I've got to go all the way.

Hi, I'm back, and I'm ashamed. lol

Anyone else's lungs absolutely hate then for the weeks/months following quitting?

I quit smoking one month and nine days ago. The quitting is going beautifully, I have no cravings and never think about cigarettes. My lungs, however, are another story. I wheeze and cough a LOT. You know, those big, deep, bronchial coughs that you normally only get when you're sick. I wake up wheezing once or twice a night and I always have to get up and go in another room so I can be gross and try to get all the phlegm out of my throat without waking my fiance. I'm really tired of it. I've quit a couple times before and it was never this bad. The sleep interruptions have me constantly exhausted and I'm not sure what to do to help this process along. Any advice??

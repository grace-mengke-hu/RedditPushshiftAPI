Day 25 Smoke Free!

I've been using an app that gives me missions every day and one of them is to post what's been working for me.  I would say the number one tool is to take it one day at a time (or one hour, or one minute even).  Expecting to have cravings and to have a plan when they hit has been helpful.  It's still hard and I still think about it often but it gets a little easier every day.  I have been using nicotine gum because the app I use recommends it &amp; I figure why go through the physical withdrawals while I'm focusing on changing my mentality?  Snacking a lot but also working out more so no weight gain so far.  Can't believe I've made it this far!  The support from this site has been invaluable :)

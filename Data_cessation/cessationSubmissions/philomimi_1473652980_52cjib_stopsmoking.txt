Smoking withdrawal and alcohol tolerance

Anybody got similar experience as mine on the following:
I'm at about the fourth month of my smoking withdrawal and felt kinda tortured with the craving. Usually, I enjoyed alcohol with smoking and felt kinda more relaxing the more I drink. But, last night, I got dizzy with the half size of my regular size of booze and puked at my regular size when I forced myself. I wonder if it's connected with my smoking withdrawal and alcohol tolerance level. Because principally, withdrawal is actually getting rid of toxins and alcohol is also a toxins. Should I best give up alcohol as well? My priority is to give up smoking, but not for the booze because I think I enjoyed it on moderation.

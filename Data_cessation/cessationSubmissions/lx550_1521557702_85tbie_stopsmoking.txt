Does the feeling of missing something ever go away?

I am 6 days in and going great except for the thing I'm about to tell you. I've been a pack a day smoker for 12 years and this has been the second longest that I've been off cigarettes; longest was about 2 months.

My cravings are manageable, the urge to smoke comes and goes and it is easy to push them aside. What I really struggle with are the mind games and the feeling that I'm missing something.

I've always associated cigarettes with pleasure and relief. Something good happens and I'm lighting up - almost instantly. Same for the bad stuff. At work I've used them as a reward - I set a target and smoke when I'm done. These weren't any big targets, most of the tasks took 30-45 mins. I got so used to this system that it happened without much thought. And when out on my "reward break", I planned what/how to do the next task. To be very honest with you'll this worked out well for me and have been doing it for years.

Now without cigarettes I constantly feel like I'm missing something, there isn't a "reward break" to look forward to. The mind games are so strong and convincing that on a few occasions I almost gave in. When it happens I have to remind myself why I quit and what I'm I getting in return (I've written this down on my phone). So far it has worked but it's very exhausting, I feel like there's a constant battle going on inside my head and it isn't going to end well for me.

I think I've conditioned my brain this way for a long time and now that I've quit it's acting crazy. How do I get it back to normal?

Sorry for the long post, I just want this thing to end. Has anyone else felt this way? If yes, how did you manage it or does it go away on its own?

Fourth day in and I can’t believe that I stopped

So it’s my fourth day in and I still can’t believe that I stopped smoking. I m using a vape with 2mg though, but I m so happy that I don’t need a cigarette, nobody needs a cigarette, we can do it!
Although I m afraid. What will happen when I go out? I used to be a heavy smoker  when I m drinking alcohol and all of my friends are smoker too.
How did you handle things like this?

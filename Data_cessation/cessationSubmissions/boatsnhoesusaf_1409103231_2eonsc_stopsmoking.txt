Question about the affects of quitting

So recently, after 4 years of smoking I decided to quit. I've been doing really good and haven't smoked a cigarette in over a month. I noticed what smoking can do to your tongue and I was wondering if it will ever go back to being a normal pink tongue and not a disgusting looking one.

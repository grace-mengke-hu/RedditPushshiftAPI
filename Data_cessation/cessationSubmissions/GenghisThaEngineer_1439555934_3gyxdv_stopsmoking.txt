I Propose a Reddit Game to Help Each Other Out

/u/Garudabird and I [recently began a game](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/3gn678/what_should_i_expect/cu09ng1) in which the loser is the first person to reset their badge.

Could I suggest that you guys try it out?

The game's rules could be:

1. Two or three people whose badges have the same number of days compete to find out who'll last the longest. The number could be bigger, but I think a small one makes you more in touch with who you're competing with.

2. Be honest. If you fall off the wagon, reset your badge.

3. If your badge is reset, you get new competitors (any bots recently lost their jobs?).

Suggestions?

The referees could be those with years on their badges... We could get someone to build us a bot that'll do the matching (line-up?) after a badge is reset... We could hold awards/give prizes every so often (amazon gift card, anyone?). We could inbox our competitors to find out how they're doing...

What do you guys think?

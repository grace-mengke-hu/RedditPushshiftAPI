Went out tonight for a bit to eat and drinks and didn't smoke

An old friend who gave not seen in almost 20 years had posted this afternoon on fb if anyone wanted to grab a bit to eat. I said sure. So we went out to a place to eat and had a few drinks and the thought of smoking only passed through my mind a few times and then only for a brief bit as we were busy chatting. Here's to 32 days and counting smoke free 😁

DAY One

I HAVE JUST BARELY HELD IT TOGETHER TODAY.

thank god I'm not also giving up drinking or junk food...because that's the only way i'm surviving this. I have had multiple cravings throughout the day, and have been able to avoid falling to temptation by 

1) talking about it with co-worker, who ALSO QUIT 3 days ago 

2) talking about it with roommate who is ALSO QUITTING today

i am very concerned that i will let these two people in my life down. thank god for them both!!!

but i don't care if i gain weight, or seem more erratic than usual, or feel incredibly perturbed by EVERY MINUTE DETAIL OF LIFE. shit perturbed me before, but now it's more magnified since i am holding off the nicotine.

I smoked since age 19. I am now 27. I smoked about a half pack per day. I loved them dearly- my only friends in harrowing times of deep melancholy, my celebration marking one event or another, my crutch to replace stress followed by anxious eating habits after dealing with bulimia since age 13.

i must continue to remind myself that this is worth it in the long-term. 

i refuse to succumb to cancer.

i refuse to give my money to merchants of death.

i refuse to be disillusioned.

i refuse to put that self-conceited 'image of cool' before my health.

this is because :

a) i love my body- it is perfectly designed to function exactly as it needs to 

b) i respect my body as part of the world, and nature, and as a wholly beautiful entity without any need for a fake faint high.

c) i love the people in my life who care about me- my family, especially my niece and nephew who look up to me, who will want me to have to energy to play with them and teach them until they are grown. i want them to make good decisions informed by meaningful observation of adults around them. 

d) i am SO POOR!!!!!! i am so looking forward to having money in my life again!!!!! the idea of actually putting money aside is now that much more possible!

*wish me luck*

Made it through the week without a relapse

Stereotypical bleeding heart liberal, turned broken heart during this election cycle (note: if you disagree, bully for you, post is not about politics). Smoker for 11 years, quit 3 weeks ago and managed to make it through a very sad, difficult week without picking up a pack. Came close and actually texted my smoking buddy neighbor about going over to bum one from him, but when the appointed hour arrived I had changed my mind. 

Now to get through the next 4 years...

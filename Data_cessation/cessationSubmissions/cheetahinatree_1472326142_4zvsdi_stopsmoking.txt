I quit because of this Reddit

Led to this sub from Smoke Free App. I was a hardcore chain smoker for 30 or more years. Hardcore! Former bf mentioned he did not like women who smoked. No problem cause we are not serious. I see Allen Carr video on this site back in Feb/March & I attend NYC seminar. Bf is soul mate I dreamed about. Now we are serious, and I return from seminar after reading book. That Sunday we have a  big disagreement(did I mention this is my soulmate). I smoked a pack that day knowing I would not do it again. So, my favorite coworker passed two weeks later, I have job ambiguity,  I broke up with the soul mate, my mother has health issues. oh also, I am a bourbon drinker. Did I mention I was a heavy smoker?  Other anxieties still exist, but I am not smoking.Fast forward three months and 25 days later.  My smoking and non smoking friends are amazed and say I do not give myself enough credit. I thank God.  I still get the cravings but I do not indulge. Did I gain weight? I have not lost 10 lb  "in love" weight. I have smoke blown in my face, I still drink. If I can do it you can.

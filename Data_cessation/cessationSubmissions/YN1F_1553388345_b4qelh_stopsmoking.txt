Whelp... I fell off the wagon today.

Had been smoke-free since Jan 11th, but today went and bought a pack of USA Gold, some rolling tobacco and Top  papers.

I have been vaping some gawd-awful 70vg low-nicotine juice, my mouth has been dryer than a gourd for like two days, and I was about to have a nicotine-fit. I'm not proud of myself, and I'm going to give 'er another go when my new order of better juice gets here sometime next week. But, to be honest, that first cigarette tasted and felt sssooo goood.

I've just been frustrated as hell with all the money I've blown buying shitty-tasting e-juice, trying to find that perfect tobacco flavor. I bet I've spent a couple hundred dollars, easy. Oh well. Hopefully when my new juice gets here I'll like it enough to stick with it.

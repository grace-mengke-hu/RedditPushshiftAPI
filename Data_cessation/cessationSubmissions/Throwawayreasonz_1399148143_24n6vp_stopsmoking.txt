1 PM on a Saturday, and it's day 5. God damn, do I need a smoke.

As title states, I'm trying my best to distract myself, but every 15-30 mins I get a compulsion to grab my keys, drive to 7-11, and get a pack of smokes. Until today, I normally have the ability to go and beat on a heavy bag to work out the compulsion, but my roommate (who the room belongs to) is out, so I'm looking for another way to divert myself from relapsing, suggestions?

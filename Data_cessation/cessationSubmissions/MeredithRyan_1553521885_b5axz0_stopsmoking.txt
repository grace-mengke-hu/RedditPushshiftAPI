Which Carr audio book?

Hi all. I’m 39 days in but on NRT about to step down on day 43. I feel like I’m doing well but reading on here sometimes makes me missing smoking. I do not want to give it. I have the digital book and illustrated version but I would like the audio. On amazon there is a ton of versions. Which one is the right audio one for me to purchase? I’m gonna listen to it working out instead of music. Thanks

Tomorrow marks 2 weeks!

Tomorrow marks 2 weeks without a cigarette! It is getting easier, and I am using my vape, less ,and less, . Will still use it when needed. But think after 2 more weeks, will try to go from 3mg. Down to 0 mg. Depending on how next 2 weeks go. Just going to take it day by day,like I have been doing..feel good so far that I have exceeded my last quit attempt, never thought I'd make it this far, thanks to reading these posts here pretty daily, they are very helpful. Lots of great advice!

I want to quit it forever

Hi guys, this is my nth attempt to quit :\) and I am without nocotine in no forms from last 5 days. I smoked 5\-6 cigarettes to the maximum during working days and none during weekends \(after marriage\) &amp; always failed to stick to the promises about quitting, first to wife and then to my adorable daughter.

This time I was referred to this group by Stop Smoking Android app &amp; glad that finally I gathered the courage to join a group and accept that I have an addiction. 

Hope being a part of the group motivates, supports me to quit this DEMON behind forever.

Just quit!!!

Im twenty and I've been smoking for five years now as of a couple of days ago. I tried to quit countless times before to no avail, alway giving in before the withdrawal symptoms really subside. Just desided to put out my last cancer stick for good before my last morning shift for the week, so its the closest thing to good timing i can get. I'll keep yall posted on how the next couple of days go. Any tips or kind words would be appreciated!

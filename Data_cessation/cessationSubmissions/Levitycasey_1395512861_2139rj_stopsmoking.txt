Quit at midnight last night.

This is my second time quitting. The first time, I stopped for 8 days before buying an e-cigarette and eventually going back to tobacco. 
I'm quitting because of the awful cough I've developed over the past 4 or so years of smoking. In the 8 days that I was clean, I could breathe/bike easier, my skin tone was more healthy looking, and overall, I felt amazing. 



Does anyone know of great Android apps that track your progress/health benefits? I currently have Cessation Nation, and while it works pretty well I'm always open to better suggestions. 

Thanks for having this supportive community!

Inspired by the r/bestof u/uniquestring post I have made it 7 days smoke free! Thank you!

I had never even heard of this sub before that post crept into my news feed,  I read it and instantly took a look around the sub, saw people struggling, people succeeding, and helpful tips. I have two small children, a husband, friends and other family whom I can't picture having to leave behind. I knew then I had to quit. Next day I went and got a vape! It has been so helpful!  The first 3 days were hard, cravings were bad, but day 4 it was like having my life back! I knew I had control over the cravings and now (day 7) I've been barely using my vape and I don't even feel the need to smoke at all. I couldn't have come across this sub at a better time, and I thank you all for being inspirational.

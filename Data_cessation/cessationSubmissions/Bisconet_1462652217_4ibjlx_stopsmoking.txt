One Hour in Cold Turkey

I've been smoking since I was 14.  I switched to an e-cigarette and found no benefit from it, actually made my lungs feel worse even while seeking out "organic" solutions.   Looking for accountability buddy over the next few days.  Talked with girlfriend but dont wanna put it all on her because shes in finishing up her degree in the next week.

Edit: I turn 30 on the 21st and want to enter my next 30 years with out tobacco.

Edit2: checking in at 4 hours. Thanks for the words of encouragement.  Been drinking lots of water and playing EVE Online to keep my mind busy while at work.  Working at a casino, so the temptation is around me 24/7.  My GM hate smokers, and I want to stand proud when I say I've kicked the habit.

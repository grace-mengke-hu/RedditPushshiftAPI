30 Days and a major milestone.

Well, it's been 30 days since the last time I sucked on a cancer stick. I missed it a bit during the past month, but had a few things go toward helping me stay off. 

I initially quit because I got a severe cold and couldn't smoke for how painful it was. A week later, I realized I had made it a whole week without smoking and determined I would keep that going.

Another thing that helped me not get back on the habit was that a couple weeks ago I had all four of my wisdom teeth removed at once. (Yeah, this has been a REALLY hard month for me, guys. Seriously one of the toughest of my life.) The doctor warned me stringently against tobacco usage for a multitude of reasons, and I kept his advice in the forefront of my mind to great effect. 

Regardless, the hardest thing has been coffee and beer, two of my most favorite things on this planet next to bacon and (formerly) tobacco. Hanging out with my buddies at the lake while fishing, cracking open a beer, and having a sudden and intense urge to bum a smoke off of one of them was easily the most difficult thing I've ever had to resist, but I did it. Waking up in the morning and having my coffee has been a challenge too...

Then comes this morning. I sip my coffee and start writing the latest chapter of my novel (my favorite hobby) for about two hours. Then, while casually taking a break and watching a video on youtube, I see someone smoking a cigarette. 

You guys. It's incredible. I was drinking coffee *and* saw someone smoking a cigarette... and I realized I didn't want one. I didn't feel a craving for a cigarette. 

I think I've done it, guys. I think I've really kicked 'em this time.

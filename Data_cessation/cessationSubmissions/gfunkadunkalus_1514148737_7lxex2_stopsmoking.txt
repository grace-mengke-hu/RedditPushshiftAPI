Heavy urge for a cigarette, didn't smoke thanks to a stranger.

The holidays stress people out.  The stress gets to people like me who think about my old friend nicotine during my low points.  

After driving the whole day and passing gas station after gas station, I finally buckled.  What convinced me to stop at a gas station with the intent to buy cigarettes was the loud whisper of nicotine.  The whisper of "It's only one", "It'll make you feel better", and "You can quit after one" temporarily drowned out all the reasons why I stopped smoking in the first place.

I pulled in and was greeted by Martha, the gas station attendant.  I asked if the station sold loose cigarettes; I just needed one or two.  She said they don't.  So I said I'd buy a pack.  

"But you're going to smoke the whole thing then when you only wanted one or two," she said.

"I know, but the stress is getting to me," I reply.

"You're stronger than this," she said, "chew gum, drink a soda, but don't smoke.  You'll get through it."

She returned me to sanity.  The loud whispers of my addiction were now drowned out by "You quit because you were coughing up black phlegm, because you couldn't run a mile without dying, because you want to live longer for your family" etc.

She didn't know me, but she was looking out for my best interest and gave me words of encouragement that made me smile and reminded me I didn't need to be controlled by nicotine.

I thanked her clumsily and got back into my car.  

I got home and needed to type this out because we're all in the same boat.  Whether we are in the process of quitting or stopped completely, we need to be reminded that we are stronger than our addiction. We all should be reminded, as Martha reminded me, that we are awesome and we can rid ourselves of our impish addictions.   

Stay strong, all!  Let's remain awesome together.

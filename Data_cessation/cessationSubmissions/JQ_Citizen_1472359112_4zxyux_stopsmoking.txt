Just put out my last one!!!

Been smoking for over 15 years. Quit for just shy of a year after a very serious sinus surgery. But a family bbq was my excuse to have just one.   Well 3 years later and feeling like absolute crap I have had it.  I just got done hacking my lungs up and said this is enough. I want to see my kids grow up.  Time for a full reboot on so many levels.

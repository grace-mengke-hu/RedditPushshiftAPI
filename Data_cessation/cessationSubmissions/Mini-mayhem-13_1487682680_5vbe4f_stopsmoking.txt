Day 4 cold turkey - any advice?

Smoked for best part of 10 years, quit a couple of times cold turkey and didn't have any cravings, could have stuck it out permanently if it wasn't for traumatic events driving me back to cigarettes.

Had my last cigarette 4 days ago, but this time I'm getting really bad cravings and withdrawal symptoms - any tips or advice to make it a bit easier? I'm determined to stick it out permanently this time around, but the temptation to lapse is pretty strong...

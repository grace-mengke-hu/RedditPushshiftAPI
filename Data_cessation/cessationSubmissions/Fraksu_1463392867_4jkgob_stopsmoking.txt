Smoking and being a music producer

I'm stuck in a cycle of smoking 2-5 packs (around 10 cigarettes in a day) and then quitting for a week or two. Afterwards I start smoking again. 

My question is how can I enjoy my music producing passion without smoking, because I always feel more into the music when smoking and producing, and I also don't overthink when I get a cigarette?

Also I've read Allen Carr 4 times so far. My best smoke-free time was 8 months, but at that time I didn't produce that much music and I was into style and fitness.

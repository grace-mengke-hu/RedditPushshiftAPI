6 days! Longest ever

Cold turkey. I've read EasyWay a few times over the years, tried every pill, patch, vape pen... I just started meditating after reading The Power of Now and I quit!
I'm just so proud of myself. And happy with this new set of lens to see with. Thought I would share :)
You all help so much with your inspiration too

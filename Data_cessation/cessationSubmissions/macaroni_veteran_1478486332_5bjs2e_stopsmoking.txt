Just smoked the last partial cigarette that I could find outside my front door...

I've been smoking daily for the last three years and relying on cigarettes to cope with my anxiety. Cigarettes always give me an excuse to extricate myself when a situation gets uncomfortable for me or when I just want to go outside to calm down and think. They always give my hands something to do when I got nervous and fidgety, my eyes something to focus on when I can't make eye contact, and always worked as an easy excuse to talk to strangers. Cigarettes can calm me after an anxiety attack like no other drug, and have helped me keep my anxiety in check for years.

Apparently, I have asthma- I was told six months ago by my doctor. Despite the inhaler I've been prescribed and my multiple bronchitis diagnoses since then and my ugly, hacking cough that just wouldn't go away, I've been too terrified until now to quit entirely. I've been struggling in school and have always used that as an excuse to wait to quit, but after my last nebulizer treatment the health effects of smoking are becoming too apparent to ignore.

Please send me your positive thoughts.

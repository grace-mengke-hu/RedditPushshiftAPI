Unintentionally stopped...

Almost a full week down and I just financially could not purchase anything tobacco related. But I feel great, cardio doesn't make me feel like I'm dying 10 minutes in. This feels great, I don't need to get a pack or anything when I'm about to drive (When I smoked the most) I save time, gas, money, my life from being unable to smoke. Sure I'm stressed that I have less than a dollar to my name, but it brings to light that if I didn't smoke I'd have at least 30 dollars every month. So unintentionally this is a great accident.

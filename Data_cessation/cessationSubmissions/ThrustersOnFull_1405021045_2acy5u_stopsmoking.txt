Quitting Smoking Day 3: The Phlegm-tom Menace

Hi, me again. 

So I feel pretty good today, no real craving. Woke up quickly and easily, got to work a little early. 

I'm a little irritable today, but my chief worry is the cough I've developed. Several times I've had to stop to cough, almost approaching nausea. 

I fear that I'll end up losing my lunch in the middle of the afternoon. Is this violent cough normal? 

In good news, I've stopped shovelling food into my mouth constantly. Still chewing ridiculous amounts of gum. I've been going out to join my smoking coworkers for some social time while they have a cigarette. I thought that would be a craving trigger. It is not. Yet. 

My mind is on my work, when I'm not hacking up a lung. Hopefully this keeps up.

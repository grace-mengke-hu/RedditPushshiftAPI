Sunday is my quit day

I've had a lot of quit days, but I'm committed to Sunday. I've been re-reading Allen Carr, which helps. Every time I have a cigarette in hand, I want to quit. And then I make excuses. Going to try to remember that not smoking makes my body feel better; smoking makes me feel worse. Time (almost) to do this!

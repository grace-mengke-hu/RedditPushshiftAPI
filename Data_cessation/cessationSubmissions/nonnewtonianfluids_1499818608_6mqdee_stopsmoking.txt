I will not smoke today

I'm stressed at work -- new manager promising to heal old teams. My other project is becoming more demanding. I am behind in grad school because I just want to sleep and recover.

I'm not smoking today. 4 days is 4 days of hard fought progress. I'll settle for complaining on the internet!!!

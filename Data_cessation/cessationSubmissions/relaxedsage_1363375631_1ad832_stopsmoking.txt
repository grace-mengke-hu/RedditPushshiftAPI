Day 1 - omg the day goes so slowly

Decided to quit yesterday.

Today the work day is going SOOOOO slowly. 
Got back from lunch at 1:15. 

Since then I've 

* Watched some Youtube, 
* Checked out CNN, 
* Eaten a chocolate bar
* Browsed Reddit
* Made a tea
* Raided a co-workers cookie stash to go with the tea
* Ate a banana
* Started to look at some actual work

And omg wtf its only 2 hours gone....

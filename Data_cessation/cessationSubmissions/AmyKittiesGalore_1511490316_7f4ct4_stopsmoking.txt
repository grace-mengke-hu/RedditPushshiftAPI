After Thanksgiving Dinner

Oh man! Driving home from my brother's house just now all I could think about was how awesome it would be to have a smoke when I got home. And my bf smokes so I knew there would be cigarettes on the back porch. Arrrgh! I didn't though. I even went outside with him while he smoked and took a few puffs of my vape. No biggie! My favorite saying so far: 'You'll never regret having not smoked'

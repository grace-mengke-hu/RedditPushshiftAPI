11 days smoke free

I'll feel great, super high energy then low as can be. Certain things till trigger cravings but I stay strong. I'm also staying away from drinking until who knows I'm just worried about relapsing. I've also kinda stayed away from friends b/c they smoke. It's hard. I know I'm doing the right thing though, I feel amazing. Been walking every day.

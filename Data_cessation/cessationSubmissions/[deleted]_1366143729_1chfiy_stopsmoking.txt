Can't get in my car and go anywhere without smoking.

Seriously. I don't even have cravings.I don't even like smoking cigarettes really, they make me feel nauseous unless I'm drunk or high. I wouldn't even say I'm addicted it's just literally a habit.

I can't get in my car and go somewhere without wanting to smoke. It's the only time I do it.

Meaning I smoke maybe 3-5 cigs a day tops. Is it that bad? Is there a significant difference between 0 cigs a day and 3?  I started smoking last year around this time after a breakup but have recently seriously curbed my usage.

Is 3-5 cigs a day awful? How do you get past the desire to smoke in a car? I know I'm not the only one...

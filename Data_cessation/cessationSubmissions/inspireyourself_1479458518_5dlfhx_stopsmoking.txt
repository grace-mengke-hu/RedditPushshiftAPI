Not going to touch those Cancer sticks again, ever! (I hope so...)

This is literally my 100th attempt to quit smoking. Yes 8:30 PM was my last cigarette. Now, its 2:10 PM of the next day and I have't smoked. Have consumed 2 nicotine gums since, one last night and one today morning.

I really want to succeed. I hope I dont relapse. This smoking has been consuming my body and my mind since that last 12 years. I wanna get rid of it!

Update :

Been about 38 hours smoke free now. I struggled last night with my cravings. Waas almost about to light up. I controlled myself. It was fucking difficult though. 

Update: 27 November 2016
I fucked it all up. Went on a trip to mumbai. Ended up partying 5 days filled with cigarette and pot smoking.

Today I am back in my city and have decided to go at it again. I hope I don't falter since Im a guy with really weak will power.

Day 3 of quitting with Chantix

I've never gone this long without smoking, but I feel really proud of myself. I've smelled it and I even have a pack hidden behind my bed, but I haven't touched them. The first 2 days the urge to say 'screw it' was strong but now I feel great. I'm having some vivid dreams but that's about the only side effect and it's really not a bother. I feel a lot more confident in myself since I made it past the initial few days.

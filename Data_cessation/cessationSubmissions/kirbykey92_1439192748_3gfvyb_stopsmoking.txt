Just Starting Out.

I just had my last cigarette, and I'm nervous, but I've made it four days before without one. I'm so tired of being a slave to them, and not having extra money to spend on stuff I'd actually like to get.
I have tons of non-smoking friends who can afford video games and other stuff and I can't because of these fucking tobacco sticks!
I'm so ready and I have my girlfriend and another friend of mine going in with me. 
I have a vape but I'm gonna try to not use it too much unless the cravings get too strong, but I know also that it's just gonna prolong the addiction to nicotine. 
I also want my daughter to not to have to see me smoking anymore, she's only four now. but she sees it as common to see me smoking and I want to be a good influence on her. 
I'm always so lazy and I want to do stuff with her like running around and swimming and going outside, but I'm always so lathargic that I don't do it for as often as she'd like. 
I'm so ready! I just have to have confidence in myself!

In my experience vaping withdrawal is much worse than smoking withdrawal.

Ive withdrawalled from both many times. With cigarettes you can only smoke a couple and be good but you can literally vape 24/7. I hadnt smoked in a while but went cold turkey off the vape and bumming a real cig didnt stop the pounding headaches. Vaping withdrawal also makes me more emotionally unstable since nicotine is being consumed all day unlike smoking.

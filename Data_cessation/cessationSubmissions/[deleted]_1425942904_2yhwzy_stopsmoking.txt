It starts today

I'm 19 years old and have been smoking for 3 and a half years.
For the last month or so I just feel that I'm killing my body. I've been breathing relatively loudly and there is always that smell in my nostrils.
So I just threw out my pack and light out of the window (uncivilized I know) and I really hope that this marks a new step in my life.

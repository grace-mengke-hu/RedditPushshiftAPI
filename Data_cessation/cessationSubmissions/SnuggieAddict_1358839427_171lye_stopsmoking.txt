10 Years smoker, trying to quit first time. Cold Turkey or Reducing?

I'm a 29 years old woman and my almost 30 birthday resolution is to stop smoking because I want to get pregnant. I want to feel better. I want to be smoke free.

Yesterday I tried stopping cold turkey without any preperation because I thought - hey, how hard could it be? I only smoke half a pack a day!. It was alright for the first few hours, but after 26 hours I started crying and having panic attacks. keep in mind that I suffer from anxiety disorder, and panic attacks pretty much wreck me up. so I smoked one cigarette. One. in 26 hours. I can still be sort of proud, right?

So, I have some questions. Is cold turkey really the way to go?
how about keeping my cigarettes further apart (delaying them) until I smoke 1-2 a day for good, and then stop? How to avoid the terrible anxiety of nicotine withdrawl? (please note that I tried zyban\wellbutrin for mental needs and it was really bad for me).

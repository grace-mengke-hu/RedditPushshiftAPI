How do you deal with smoker friends?

I have smoker friends who don't think about quitting. So when we go out together they smoke and smoke and at some point I get cigarette from one of them and I relapse. I'm on my 25th day without a puff but my friends are coming to visit me this weekend. I asked them to not smoke for the weekend but they were like "we can't promise that we're not gonna smoke." 

So how do you deal with them or these kind of situations?

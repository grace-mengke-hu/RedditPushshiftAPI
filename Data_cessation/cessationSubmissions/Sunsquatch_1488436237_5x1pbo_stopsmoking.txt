What I've noticed after 5 days

First 3 days, couldn't get out of bed.

Now.

My chest feels heavy, my throat is sore, I cough incessantly, it feels like someone is drilling a hole through my throat to the back of my head, mild chronic hints at a headache, average 3 hours of sleep, keep noticing half-smoked butts on the ground.

Crazy focus, surprising amount of energy, I finally cleaned my entire apartment after 3 months of telling myself I was going to do it, I'm back on my diet and have lost 5 lbs, without thinking about it my body dropped to the floor and did 30 push-ups, increased confidence, went ahead and sent out 3 job applications after debating it for months, a girl in my class today told me I seemed different.

What the hell is going on? I'm not sure whether to be thrilled or terrified. Is this normal?

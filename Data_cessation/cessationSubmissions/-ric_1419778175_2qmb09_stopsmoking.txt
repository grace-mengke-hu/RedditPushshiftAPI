Having a hard time in my third months of quitting...

Hello fellow quitters, i'm kinda new here and need some motivation to keep quitting.

I recently passed my second month of quitting quite easily, i could go day by day without even thinking about smoking. Sometimes when i hang out with my friends, couple of friends that used to smoke together with me offered me a cig and i could easily turned that offer down.

But now in my third months, i had it really bad. I don't know why but the urges of smoking that i had almost forgotten in the past 2 months comes back. I almost relapsed yesterday, but i tried really hard to reasoned with my mind why i should not relapse and finally stop myself to buy a pack of cigarettes.

Do anyone have a similar experience like me ?

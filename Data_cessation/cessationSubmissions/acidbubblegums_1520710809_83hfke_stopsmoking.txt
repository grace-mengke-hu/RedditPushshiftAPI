18 days smoke free but worried

Have been smoke free for 18 days and it has been my longest since I started smoking 25 years ago. Yesterday, 18 days could easily become 20 and 20 days, 1 month.

Today there is a birthday party and all my colleagues are celebrating. The anticipation of drinking is making me anxious and my cravings are very strong.

When I quit, I was at home sick with the flu. I thought that being back at work would trigger smoking again due to stress but that was not too bad. But drinking is a whole different demon.... 

I really don't want to cave in :(

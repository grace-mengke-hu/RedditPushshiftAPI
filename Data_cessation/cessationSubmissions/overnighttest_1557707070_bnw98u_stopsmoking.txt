After officially quitting 2.5 years ago, I finally quit a month ago.

When I did my big quit, I'd finally had enough. The planning work around cigarettes, sneaking behind the building and smoking near dumpsters and used sharps. More importantly, I'd recently had a baby and despite being the king of Purell and mouthwash, I knew that I stunk. Putting him to bed became an exercise in guilt. 

So I switched to the gum. You know, start on 4mg, work down to 2mg, then presto, you're done. 

Except I then chewed the gum for well over two years, all the while considering myself clean of cigarettes. My wife brought it up to me a few months ago - she just mildly said "So if you're still chewing the gum, you kinda didn't really quit did you?" She was right.

And here's the thing: I was probably taking on more nicotine than I was when I was smoking. With the gum, I was throwing them back every few minutes. In meetings, in brainstorms, you name it. Amped all the time. 

So, despite having quit cigarettes, I was in a sense an even heavier smoker. Time to cut the cord once and for all. 

And what a bloody week that was. I was working on some really unglamorous shit at my job which was probably a bit of a plus in hindsight, as I needed to focus non-stop during the day. When I wasn't working, I was a wreck. My first few nights I had bizarre, technicolor dreams - about the only upside to the miserable experience of withdrawing from nicotine. Then, no dreams at all. Zero. I'd fall into an exhausted black hole and wake up craving nicotine. Day in and day out for about three weeks.

It was only last week that the cravings basically disappeared. My resting heart rate is down dramatically, I sleep through the night really well, and despite the fact that I'm pretty much tired all the time, I'm feeling great. That's over 20 years of nicotine gone. Thank fucking Christ.

So, moral of the story - you haven't quit until you quit nicotine entirely. Gum doesn't count.

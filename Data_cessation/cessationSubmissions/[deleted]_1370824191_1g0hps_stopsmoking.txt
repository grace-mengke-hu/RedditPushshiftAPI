How do I help my fiance quit smoking without being a bitch about it or making him feel like he has to?

I've never smoked and never really been addicted to anything, so I know I don't really know what it's like. 

I'm really happy he is trying to stop, but I'm afraid to express that without making it seem like I'm putting pressure on him because of it. 

How can I support him? How can I help him?

Background: 

We have been together for 3 years and are getting married in a few months.

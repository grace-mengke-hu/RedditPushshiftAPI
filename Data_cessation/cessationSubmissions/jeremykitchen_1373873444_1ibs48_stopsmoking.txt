100 miles for 100 days?

Yay, I just hit 50 days! Since I'm so confident I'm gonna make it, I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to celebrate on my 100th day.

I'm debating doing [this 100 mile bike ride](http://beta.active.com/lebec-ca/cycling/races/the-legacy-century-ride-the-ranch-2013).

It's been a while since I last rode a century, and it might be interesting to see how well I fare after not smoking for 100 days.

Anyone gonna be hitting 100 days that day want to join me? Or really anyone at all? :)

I have some questions...

I really want to quit. Bad enough I'll go cold turkey and deal with the withdrawals. My only concerns is I'm starting to have heart issues from high blood pressure. I'm 23, and weight over 400 pounds. I want to start getting shit straight and get healthy. My only concerns is can it be dangerous to quit cold turkey? I have bad anxiety, which I've spoken with my psychiatrist and she says she'll help me on that end. I'm seeing my doctor in less than a week. Will I have any possible risks for trying to quit at once?

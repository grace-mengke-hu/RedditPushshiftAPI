Day 4, 12 hours until day 5. Kind of sad though.

I've been trying to quit for some time now and I've finally managed to do it. How exactly is pretty sad. I didn't use the patch, Chantax, cold turkey it, exercise, etc. 

It actually took me catching a cold to quit smoking completely. I'm all better now and there aren't any hardcore cravings like before. I do have a cough but that can be the aftermath of the cold.

Congratulations to me!

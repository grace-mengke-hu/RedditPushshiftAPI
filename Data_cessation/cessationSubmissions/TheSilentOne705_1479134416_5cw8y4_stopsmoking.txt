Quit, quit, QUIT (Day 1, Reprisal)

So, today's the day. I could've picked worse, but since I have vacation to look forward to at the end of the week, I figured I'd just go ahead and start now so I can look my family in the face when I visit over Thanksgiving.

I know more than a few things already. I'll probably have a blinding headache later today, which I have Advil and a water bottle for. I'll probably want one after lunch, which is why it's really good that it's cold out and I don't want to go outside. I know I'll be snappish tomorrow on Day 2, and probably a bit on Day 3, which is why I have vacation to look forward to at the end of the week. 

All in all, I might just be set. As usual, you all are inspiring and awesome! Keep up the good work!

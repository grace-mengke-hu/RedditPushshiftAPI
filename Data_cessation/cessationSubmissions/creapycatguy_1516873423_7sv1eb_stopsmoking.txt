Hope I can say goodbye this time

So, I quit for a few months, and a week ago I picked up another cigarette. I'm so mad at myself :( Just bought a pack yesterday and I'm back to smoking them like I was before.

So, hoping it goes away after this. Happened to be seeing my doctor and asked for some NRTs, and she prescribed me Chantix. I've been fighting getting it prescribed because of the side effects, as I have dealt with depression and those things in the past (don't want to go back). I'm getting 0.5 mg today and higher later on, wish me luck!

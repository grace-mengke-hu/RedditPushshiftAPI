Mood swings with quitting? I feel like I am falling into a huge depression.

I quit cold turkey 5 days ago and HOLY FUCK!

I've never had such crazy mood swings. 

I go from depressed, to confident to introverted to socializing with everyone in the room, to irritable and worst of all-to feeling worthless and like a complete loser in the span of a day. 

On top of these intense mood swings, I even felt a bit suicidal today. 

Is this normal? If so, how long does it last?

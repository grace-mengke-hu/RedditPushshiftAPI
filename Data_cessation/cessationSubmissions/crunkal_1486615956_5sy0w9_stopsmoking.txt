Quitting and afraid.

Today my husband and I discussed quitting. The conversation made me so stressed out I cried. I'm so afraid I can't do it. I don't want to fail and disappoint my husband and myself. 

I really want to quit. It is the nastiest habit. I'm spending a fortune and it is horrible for me. I just don't know how to do it. I don't think I can go cold turkey, but my husband is afraid if I ween off of it I won't be able to quit. 

What do I do? I need help. What methods did you guys do that made it easier?

Only 6 days but...

Just went “out” out and spent my entire evening surrounded by cigarettes and smokers. Didn’t ONCE feel tempted. I just wanted to say I’m proud of myself. 
 
15 years 25-30 a day to 0 cold turkey and it’s working well for me so far.

I just wanted to share my achievement. Thank you

<48 hours in, feeling constantly dizzy/light headed. Anything to help with that?

As the title says I'm kicking this addiction's arse. Believe it or not for the last 5 or so years I've never made it more than 24 hours on a quit attempt so this time round I'm feeling pretty good. (Thanks Allan Carr).

Anyway, all day today (and yesterday) I've been feeling really light headed/dizzy. It's quite cool to be semi-drunk all the time so far but I do need to concentrate on my work, any advice or remedy to help me out here? Or just gotta suck it up and it'll go when exactly?

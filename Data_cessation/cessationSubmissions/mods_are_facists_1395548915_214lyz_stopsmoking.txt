What about using Chantix and Zyban at the same time?

I haven't seen any studies on using them in conjunction! But i'll add that Chantix quitters were 20% more likely to have stayed quit after 3 months. What is more, people who use Zyban quit smoking far less successfully than Chantix long-term and short-term. Over the long term a fifth of all who try it with Chantix, succeed.

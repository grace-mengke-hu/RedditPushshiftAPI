Allen Carr says withdrawals can last up to 3 weeks. FML.

I'm worried, this shit sucks. But, according to Mr. Carr:

It just takes will power and restraint. There's no physical pain, it's all in the mind. Stay confident and assure yourself that you don't need nicotine. The craving will disappear and you will be able to enjoy things WITHOUT having a smoke in your hand. 

This shit is hard.

Feels like I'm about to relapse soon

At 40-something days. Perservered through the physical 1st week. Hard but expected difficulty. Perservered through the next psychological days, unlearning routines. No way was it easy but it did get better. The pull of most routines diminished or disappeared. It got much easier. Cravings would come, I would recognise them and deal with them. Soon enough I could see how this could turn to months, to years, to never again. 

Then something happened. 5 days ago I got high intensity and many cravings. I thought ok, wow, but you aren't getting the better of me. Then the same the next day, and the next. Yesterday I could hardly focus. Same today. That's 5 days of utter misery and last couple of feeling unable to function. No triggers! New (enjoyable) routines. Don't know wtf is going on but I'm a step away from having a puff. My reason and desire for quitting hasn't changed. My resolve these past 5 days has been pushed to near its breaking point.

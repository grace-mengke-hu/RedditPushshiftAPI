I'm quitting (again). This time I feel different about it. 

I read Allan Carr's Easy Way to Quit Smoking. Now I know what TA feels like in a freshmen English course. The man cannot write very well. He does, however, understand what it takes to quit smoking. I no longer feel like I'm giving something up. I feel like I'm gaining something by quitting. I'm actually looking forward to each withdraw pang! They are like little reminders of what I'm accomplishing. I'm killing that monster inside of me!

Hang in there fellow quitters. Stay positive. Remember that smoking does nothing for you!

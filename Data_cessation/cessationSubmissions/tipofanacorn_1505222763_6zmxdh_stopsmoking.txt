I feel like there is no reason to do anything if I can't smoke.

I quit smoking a week ago, and it has been surprisingly easy compared to past tries. But I can't shake the feeling that life is boring, if I can't smoke. Will this feeling go away at some point, or do I have this shit hanging over my head for the extra 10 years I gain by quitting? Aaaanyway.. good luck to all you quitters, eventually everybody will smoke their last cigarette.

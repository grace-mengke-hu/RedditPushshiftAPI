Mind playing tricks on me

Decided to quit smoking yesterday because I was hungover and the cravings are so much easier to deal with for the first 12 hours if you feel like you’ll throw up if you smoke a cig. (Sorry but it’s true lol) 

Now I’m 1 day and 12 into this thing and I can’t help but think “damn I don’t know if I was ready, I didn’t even enjoy or remember much of my last smoke”

I know this is my mind fucking with me but damnit if it doesn’t get to me and make me mad. I will also catch myself walking towards my purse to grab smokes and then searching for a lighter and it’s almost like as soon as my finger touches the pack of smokes or the lighter I remember that I don’t smoke anymore, and it makes me sad. 

This is my 2nd time quitting, I’ve smoked for 15 years. Last time I quit, I held strong for 5 months and then in a moment of weakness and extreme stress I turned back to smoking, thinking it would make things better. But it never did. It never made anything better at all. It’s just in your head. I hate this, I hate that it’s something that I want and also something I don’t want. I hate that I love smoking. 
The only thing I’m holding onto right now is that the worst part (for me, the first 12-24 hours) is over. I don’t have to go through that again as long as I don’t smoke. 


Fuck cigarettes. I’m gonna make myself hate the damn things.

Today I relapsed (almost)

So I had this meeting with my employer. Last minute she anticipated it the thing and I had to run like crazy not to be late. Meeting went well, but still stressed by the rush. Got out of the office, I receive a phone call from a person very close to me which further stress me the fuck out. Here’s when the crazy craving comes up. I NEED A CIGARETTE. I bump into a friend of mine, a smoker. He didn’t know I quitted. ‘do you have a cigarette’ ‘actually no, I am going to buy a pack rn’
And that was it. I didn’t relapse, but I would have. I only got lucky.

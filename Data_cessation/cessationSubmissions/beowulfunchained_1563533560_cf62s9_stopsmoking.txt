Need help / Guidance [ Ex smoker for 10 years, 10 cigs/ day, quit cold-turkey 26 days ago ]

I have become extremely irritable and patience-less ( I used to be exactly opposite ). Smallest of things make me want to bang my head on the wall or yell at people to shut up. Earlier I used to work all night till morning 7am, and then go to office at 11am without feeling too much down, because I used to smoke two cigs before entering office, but now my head aches terribly ( like its doing now ) when I try that.

Will I be forever irritable? Is that my real personality that was cloaked by cigarette? Has anyone dealt with something like this?

Is there a fix? can doctors fix it? who am I supposed to contact?  A psychologist?

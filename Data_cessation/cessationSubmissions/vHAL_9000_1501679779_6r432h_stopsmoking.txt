Help! Dizziness, nausea, adrenaline and feeling my heartbeat heavily.

I have been a smoker for more than 3 years. About a week ago I felt dizziness, nausea, adrenaline and my heart was beating like crazy while smoking a cigarette. I could barely move and put my cigarette out. It felt terrible and I started hyperventilating. I managed to call an ambulance before almost fainting and they put me on intravenous sedatives for a few hours. Milder symptoms returned after again trying to smoke the day after and a few days later. I haven't touched a cigarette since then but I'm very concerned about this. Did I fuck up my lung or heart? Anyone else ever get this?

My experience with the patches

Hey guys! I just wanted to share my experience with nicotine patches!

For starters, I'm not even counting the days, because I feel like it will impede my process a little bit. I started with the 21mg patch probably a week ago. I think I'm about halfway through my first box. 

When I first put it on, that first day, I allowed myself to smoke whenever I wanted. I smoked 3. I was like, okay, tomorrow I'm going to smoke one less. So, the next day I smoked 2, next day 1, and then down to none.

After I got to not smoking at all, I would put the patch on as soon as I finished breakfast, which was my normal first cigarette of the day. After 2 days of doing that, I started trying to put the patch on  later and later each day, so I would be getting less nicotine throughout the day. Also, I take the patch off at night, since I don't usually get in during sleep time anyway. (the first couple of nights I left it on and it caused me to constantly wake up through the night).

Like I said, I'm not exactly sure what day I'm on at this point, but when I put a patch on now, I actually get a slight nicotine buzz. I know that I'm supposed to stay on the 21 mg for like, 6 weeks, but I feel that because I'm doing so well with them now, I would skip straight to the 14mg, doing the same thing I am now, and then eventually to the 7mg, down to none.

I really feel like this is going to work. My husband is also working on quitting. (I'm deployed right now, so he's doing his own thing at this point). I'm actually trying to convince my dad to try quitting as well! 

If anyone has an input on my plan, or can share their own stories, that'll be awesome!!

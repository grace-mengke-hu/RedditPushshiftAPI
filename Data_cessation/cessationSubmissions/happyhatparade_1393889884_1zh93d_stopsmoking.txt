Help!

I've read Allen Carr's Stop Smoking books a few times now. First time a few years ago where I managed to stop for 3 months. Now, I've read and re-read a few of his books and though much of the message has hit home, I just can't seem to make it through the day without believing the 'little monster' lies and lighting up.

Does anyone have any advice?

I understand the brainwashing, I don't desire a cigarette (though I must do if I end up having one?) But the fear side of my brain is worse at night and I get scared, about what I can't tell. I guess I need to figure out...

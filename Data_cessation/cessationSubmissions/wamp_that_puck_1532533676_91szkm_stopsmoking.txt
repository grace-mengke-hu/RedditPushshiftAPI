Day 10 and already noticing some significant positive changes to my health!

Hi all,

I’ve been a long time lurker, but finally decided to quit last Monday. I had smoked for about a year (not more than 10 a day) but then switched to vaping (Juul). From there, I increased my nicotine consumption to the point where I was having the equivalent of 1 pack/day. 

With the Juul, it’s easy to overlook just how much nicotine you’re consuming. I probably would have continued had I not also been building my budget the day I quit. I looked through my past transactions and realized that I’d spent almost $1000 on Juul pods over 8 months.

Anyways, I decided to use low-dose NRT (first lozenges, now a Step 3 patch). Despite cutting my daily nicotine use from 50mg to 7mg, I haven’t had terrible cravings and will just pop a piece of gum in when I do. And I’m already noticing some significant health benefits! I’ve been getting better sleep, albeit with some strange dreams and a few nightmares. Some of my IBS symptoms have disappeared, and it feels like my lungs are able to keep up with strenuous activity for the first time in months. A lot of this is probably placebo, but even so it has motivated me to keep up with the NRT regimen and manage my cravings. 

It feels good to finally be a part of this community, and I’m looking forward to continuing my journey with y’all. Here’s to hoping that I can keep building on this progress! 

Side note, what is the name of the app that I see all of these screenshots from? Feel like that could help me out as well.

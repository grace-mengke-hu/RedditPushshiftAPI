I slipped up, but I’m moving past it now.

I promised my girlfriend I would stop smoking before my birthday. I managed to go a whole week without smoking, which is the longest I’ve gone in about a year. 

I felt really good. My cardio seemed to improve and my breathing felt a lot less labored. Well I fucked up. I ended up going to the gas station and buying a pack of light cigarettes saying “this will be my last one for real.” How stupid of me. 

I smoked one right away and felt like I hadn’t missed a week. Then today, I smoke one and I ended up getting a HORRIBLE headache. The kind where you just lay in the dark and wait for it to be over. 

If something does that to my body, then I certainly don’t need to be doing it regularly. Fuck that. I went outside to the trash bin and threw out the rest of the pack. I fucked up by getting that pack, but now I feel even more determined to quit.

Never did I ever think I would be...

a nonsmoker!!!  Today is my three year "smoke free" anniversary.   I feel sooo gooood.  I smoked for 13 years and I smoked a lot (especially when there was alcohol involved).  I thought I was stuck being a smoker forever.  It was beginning to take a toll on my breathing which affected my ability to workout and other extracurricular activities too. ;)  It took 4 attempts (using different methods each time) for it to finally stick.  Stay strong!  If I can do it, anyone can!!!

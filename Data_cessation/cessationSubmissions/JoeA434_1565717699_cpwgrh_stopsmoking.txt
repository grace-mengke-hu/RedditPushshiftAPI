2 months smoke free but still dealing with Insomnia

I’ve been smoke free for over 2 months now, and I’m still having having bad insomnia. I’ll sleep for about 4 hours straight, and then I’ll wake up and be in and out of consciousness for the next 4 hours. This was the first symptom I noticed when I quit, and it’s still just as prevalent if not worse than when I started. I was hoping it would go away but it hasn’t and its really started to negatively impact my life. I will never smoke again, but is there anything I can do to relieve this? Other smokers that have quit, have you also had similar issues after being smoke free for 2 months? Any tips or similar experiences anyone can share would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

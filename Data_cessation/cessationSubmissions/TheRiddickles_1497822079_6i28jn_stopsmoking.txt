One year today

Today makes it one year since I quit smoking. I was a pack a day guy for about 5 years. I'm way more active in the gym and have gotten back into jiu jitsu. My endurance is so much stronger now. Rarely get cravings anymore. 

Edit:  Wanted to add.  I quit using a combination of chantix and me being a stubborn bastard.  The chantix definitely helped curb cravings but even after using it for over a month I was STILL smoking.  The cigarettes tasted like shit and I wasn't finishing each one, but was still about a pack a day.  The chantix made my stomach feel like shit though and I was eager to stop taking it.  So I had about a week's supply left, didn't buy another pack and just quit that way.  I'd say the first two weeks were the worst for me.  After that it became much easier and aside from the habitual craving I was fine.

I came down with a cold on Christmas Eve.

I woke up Christmas Day with a stuffy nose and a sore throat, so I ended up barely smoking at all then or yesterday. I smoked once yesterday and ended up deciding to just say screw it and use my current ailment to my advantage rather than wait until New Years like had been the plan.

So, one day smoke free!

Refused a smoke offer, feeling stronger this time.

So after being cigarette free for a few days (again). I was offered a smoke by a friend at work tonight, and I refused it! It felt good to finally have that power over my actions again. Hopefully this time sticks. Much love to you all for the support in this community.

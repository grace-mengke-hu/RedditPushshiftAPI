Parents reaction

I decided yesterday night to quit smoking. I looked back at my life and decided it's time to get a hold on the situation and started shaping it on my own terms. I took the packet of cigarettes and snapped each one of them in half with my hands and threw them in the basket.
I woke up this morning and this was the conversation:
Mom: "what did you do with the cigarettes?"
Me: "I decided to quit"
Sister: "What did he do?"
Mom: "He have cut them in half and threw them"
Sister: "is he crazy?"

I didn't want this to be theatrical or something. I just thought that wanting to quit and finishing the packet didn't get along well...

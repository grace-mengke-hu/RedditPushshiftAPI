30 days done. Thanks to a sore throat combined with cold.

It might sound funny, but I have learned that the best time to quit smoking is when you have a cold. They say that the first two weeks of quiting something is the hardest? Well it is, and having a cold along with a sore throat makes it far less tempting to smoke up(atleast it did in my case). 

PS I'm not saying to go out in the winters and catch a cold intentionally. But well, that's what worked for me. It's hilarious but yea, 30 days done. x).

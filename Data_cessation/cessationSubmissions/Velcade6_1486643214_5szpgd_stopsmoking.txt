Objective things I miss (and liked) about smoking?

I used to be smoking for like 10 years or so, 10-20 cigarettes per day. Maybe less sometimes, sometimes even more (especially at parties). And I only had cravings in the first few days, then it stopped. I just gave up smoking because of potential health issues. But - and it is a huge BUT - here are some my thoughts about quitting: 


* I'm still standing in the cold/rain. I have many smoker friends... so why would I miss a good conversation (which is going on while smoking outside) just because I'm not smoking? So I go out with them. But the fact is - I hate standing outside in the cold, and doing _nothing_. (at least they're inhaling and puffing, but me I'm doing nothing.)

* I don't have a legit _reason_ at work to go outside with other co-workers while they're taking a smoke-break. And if my boss were smoking (and I'm not) it would just feel awkward not trying to go out and socializing with him either.

* Now that I'm a non-smoker -- I'm sorting out girls who are smoking. When I was a smoker it didn't matter whether a girl was smoking or not, all I cared about if she was *smoking* *hot* (pun intended) :) But really, another factor to think of when dating. - quite bad. 

* Food doesn't taste better for me, it just doesn't. Not worse either, but definitely not better for me. 

* I loved planning my day around cigarettes -- it was the right thing to do, and I feel it would be the right thing to do now too. 

* Money is saved, true. But I spend it on other stupid things (yeah, personal preference and will). 

* I'm wheezing less which is good.

* Wouldn't say I have much more energy. Maybe yes, but haven't tested it yet.

Overall, when trying to balance things... quitting is the right thing to do, BUT only because of health issues.

Day 13

I am on day 13 of no smoking, had some pretty intense cravings on Day 11 but reached out to friends.  I did take 3 puffs of my last cig in the box but then threw it out along with the lighters in my car.  The last 2 days have been sooo much easier!  Less cravings and definitely not as intense.

1 Day Today. I posted here once before not long ago. I was having a meltdown about quitting AGAIN. I got some good advice, &amp; calmed down, so thanks. I've since been told by my doctor I likely have Rheumatoid Arthitis. I'm 26. This has given me the determination to actually stick with it this time.

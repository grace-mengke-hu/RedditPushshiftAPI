She didn't believe I was a non-smoker...

Soo i went to a party last night, and beer and other smokers can really be a drain on the will power, but I prevailed. Going strong on about 5 days closer to a week of no death sticks and I feel good. HOWEVER, a person at the party tried to get me smoking again, witch I don't understand, after I specifically told her that I quit and said no thanks several times, she lit up in front of me and blowed smoke in my face.. seriously, anybody met people like this?

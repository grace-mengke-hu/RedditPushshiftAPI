4 year smoker going clean. Need help to improve lung strength and volume.

Recently I've started running and I find that when I'm pushing myself, I can feel that my lungs aren't opening all the way.  It feels that theres a spot on the bottom of my lungs that isn't being used.  I try to breath as "hard" as I can and sometimes it'll open, but mostly it won't.  However, when I have a real yawn, I can feel it open. 

Was looking for advice on how to improve my lung strength.  I was thinking an over the counter asthma inhaler.  Would that work?

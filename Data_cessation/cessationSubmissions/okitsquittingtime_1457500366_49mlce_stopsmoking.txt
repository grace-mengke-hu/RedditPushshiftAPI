I can't seem to make it past 36 hours, help

First day feels good, second day feels good, end of the second it's like my body is acting on its own accord and somehow I find myself at the grocery store a block away from my house, shaking. I just don't get it. I've read Carr, I know all the tricks. I tell myself I want to quit but when I pick it up I just think to myself, "nah, I just need a little longer"

It's like sleeping with an ex the day after you break up! I feel tortured and I don't know how to get the ball rolling. I'm a secret smoker so I don't have ashtrays or anything in my house. I have to even buy a new lighter every time I relapse. Being secretive about it means I don't really have many people to support me. I'm just so embarrassed about my addiction I want to get cessation over with, but I also fear giving up my secret alone time. Help.

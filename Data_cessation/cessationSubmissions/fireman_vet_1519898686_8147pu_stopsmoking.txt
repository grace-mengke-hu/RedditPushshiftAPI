Quit smoking on vacation

Hey fine peeps. I’m a smoker. I’m leaving for Breckenridge  for a snowboard trip on Saturday and made the commitment to quit smoking the day I got back. But I’m thinking about bumping that up to Saturday and not smoking during my vacation. All Saturday I’ll be in an airport, plane, or rental car. Same when I come back Thursday. Breckenridge is essentially a smoke free town. The resort to my knowledge is smoke free. My Airbnb is smoke free and you can’t smoke at the bus stops. I’ll be active most of the week and occupied and not in my normal routine. I’m not really one to get irritable when I quit. My buddy I’m going with is a non smoker, so I try to be respectful to him. Thoughts?

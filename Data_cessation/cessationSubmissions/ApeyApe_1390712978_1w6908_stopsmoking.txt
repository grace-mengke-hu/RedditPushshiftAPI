3 weeks in, weird symptoms...

Hey there...
So I'm on day 22 (yay!) and over the last week, I've been having some weird and unexpected symptoms. Specifically, when I wake up each morning, my lungs FEEL like I've smoked the night before. Like, to the point where I mentally review the night before to double check I haven't smoked. 

Is this normal? Is this the cilia in my lungs healing itself? This is the only symptom I've had (I've not even been coughing up the gross stuff I thought I would). I was about a 1/2 pack a day smoker when I quit.

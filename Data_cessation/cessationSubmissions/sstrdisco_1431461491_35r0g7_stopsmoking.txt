Be Nice to Yourself

Every day I come through stopsmoking and I read the same thing over and over and over...I feel like shit, I hate myself, quitting smoking is the worst thing I've ever done...

Quitting smoking, giving up nicotine as a whole, is hard. Why make it worse? Because really, here's the bottom line: you deserve to be well and healthy. You deserve a life that doesn't revolve around addiction.

Why not tell yourself that you're giving yourself a gift? Healthy lungs, a longer lease on life, more time with loved ones? Why not put a game plan in place to address withdrawal, triggers, cravings, and habits?

I know it's worth it, I feel it with only 19 days. I read it when I see old-timers on here give advice. I don't think people should be hard on themselves about this. Just, be nice to yourself. You deserve it.

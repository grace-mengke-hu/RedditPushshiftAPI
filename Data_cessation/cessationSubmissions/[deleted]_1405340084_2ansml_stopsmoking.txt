Smoking friends and beer didn't lead to a slip-up

Managed to go out to the bar last night to watch the world cup. Despite smoking friends and 3 big beers, didn't have any intense cravings. Feeling pretty strong now. That's in great contrast to Friday night (the dreaded day 3), when I had a few drinks and then thought I would be willing to cut off my right arm to get a smoke. Didn't slip up. Gonna make it. I think it's true that if you really want to quit and have a positive mindset, it's really not that hard!

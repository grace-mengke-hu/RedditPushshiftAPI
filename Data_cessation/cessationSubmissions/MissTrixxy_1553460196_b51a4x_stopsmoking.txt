Posting here to stop myself smoking!!

4 weeks on Champix and 10 days of not smoking and this is the hardest moment so far. I'm itching to walk round to my mates house to borrow some baccy and skin up. Usually the craving goes or I get distracted from it within minutes but it won't go away! I just needed to rant and I know you will all understand.

I cleaned off my patio, the sun is out, and I don't smoke anymore

Today I have done some spring cleaning, taken a ride and laid in actual grass at the beach, and just got done with playing with my kids. The air feels so good, the sun is amazing. I went out on my newly cleaned patio and sat back in my favorite spot to take in the sun, the sky, the kids playing. Earlier, I had found another little stash of cig butts that spent the winter out there and tossed them. As I sat down and relaxed fully my brain thought 'cigarette' to reward myself for today. Ha! So funny. The thoughts about smoking do come often as the season shifts and other triggers come up. But it's getting easier and easier. I was able to be fully present interacting with the kids, get things done, and really breathe and feel the sweetness of spring. What amazing gifts!

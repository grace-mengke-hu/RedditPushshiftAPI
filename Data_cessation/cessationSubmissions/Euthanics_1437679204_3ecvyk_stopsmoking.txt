Quit smoking but considering 0% nicotine e-cigs. Thoughts?

I'm at 40 days now and am definitely over the worst of it. It took a few tries to get here but I will not be going back now. I am so happy with what I am accomplished and knowing I can motivate myself and change has helped me begin to hack away at new goals!

My biggest issue quitting was stress, and I found I was having a lot of panic attacks. On bad days, several times a day. While I'm less stressed now, I'm still learning to deal with it. I'm exercising more and practising just giving myself space and working on my breathing but I really miss the release of cigarettes. A friend of mine is on e-cigs exclusively and I get quite jealous watching him roll it in between his fingers and purse his lips as he drags. It's really making me think that nictoine free e-cigs may let me trick myself into thinking I'm smoking and act as a stress reliever.

What are you thoughts? Would it just be a crutch? Would it start making my choice to not smoke more difficult? Is this a terrible idea?

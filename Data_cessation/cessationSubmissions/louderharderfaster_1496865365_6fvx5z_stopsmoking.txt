Day 5

Just had a nasty, petty fight with my SO. My very first urge was to drive to the store and buy a pack of cigarettes. But then I played the tape all the way through: in order to overcome my desire to be smoke-free I would have to nurse my resentment at my partner, I would buy the smokes in a fit of lame rage masked thinly by corner store courtesies. I'd unwrap the pack like the pro I am, crumpling and getting all the plastic and paper in the trash can... I would then light up and it would taste like shit, the nicotine bathing every vein, causing that slight head rush. I would not make it past 5-6 puffs before putting it out, but less than 30 minutes later I would light up the second one and smoke all of it. A third would lead to a fourth...  by the fifth cigarette I would be planning my next quit date. 

I want to get to day 6 and beyond. I want it more than anything else at long last. 

This is just a note to self :)

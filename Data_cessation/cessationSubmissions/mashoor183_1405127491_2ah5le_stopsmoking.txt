My friends smoke and I'm not totally sure what to do

So a lot of my friends smoke. I'm a non-smoker. Never smoked a cigarette in my life so it's obviously very hard for me to relate to the difficulties. I have at one point attempted to convince them to quite, but quickly realized that they know all the risks and all the consequences, and they would just tell me that I "don't know how hard it is" and that they've tried and just couldn't do it. 

I quickly started feeling that whenever I tried to say anything about it, all it would do is annoy them because they've heard it all before time and time again. At the same time though, I hate the idea of just letting them go about this horrible past time and not being able to do anything to help. Anyone have any advice?

Starting over.

Kicking myself. Day 9 today, and in my lunch break I stopped at the shop on the way home and bought a pack of 20s after battling intense cravings for about 24 hours. Life is hard at the moment, constant fights with my fiancé (who is also on day 9), exam in a week which I am extremely unprepared for, can’t focus on work or study and am exhausted. Smoked 2 cigarettes in my lunch break which OF COURSE made me feel disgusting, another fight with my partner after tea led to cigarette number 3. Very disappointed in myself, but I am about to screw up the remaining 17 little bastards and start fresh. Tomorrow is another day.

dirty butts

quit smoking this summer (after 10+ years)  -- I HAVE slipped up a couple times although haven't really enjoyed it.

ANyways, a good friend dropped by for a weekend visit and she smokes cigs in thirds, always going for little puffs and then stashing butts around.  That smell, lingering on her and in my cabin was enough to make me never want to be a dirty smoker again.  
Stay strong.

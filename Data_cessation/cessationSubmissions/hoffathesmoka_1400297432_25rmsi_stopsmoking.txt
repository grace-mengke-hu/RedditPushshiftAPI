Tips+Support trying to quit {Long post}

Hello. Looking for some help here.

I have been reading a lot and trying to mustard up the strength to post something up here. I tried my first cigarette at 15 and then began smoking at least one to two a day at 16 by 18 I was smoking ten a day since I could buy them. In my college years I began to smoke a pack a day to half a pack (2 years straight) at social events just to stay outside with everyone (at that point I didn't realize that was the reason.) I could feel what they were doing to my body, yet I never brought myself I just smoked through the pain.
    Now 21 I quit for two weeks and could feel the difference until I got a job where cigarettes were east to access. It is a common thing to do on a break since I can take them anytime it is not busy, and all the check list items are done and triple checked. Co-workers smoke also so they would bum me one without me having to ask. I have cut myself down to a pack or two every two week trying to save money. 
    Today I caught myself in a mind trick with my addiction I bought a pack today when simply trying to get my schedule for this week while talking to a co-worker. Without even thinking I went outside lit one and began talking to another about work. When I got into the car my boyfriend looked at me and said "I thought you weren't buying another pack." I just wanted to face-palm because I didn't want to buy a pack. (it was only $2.50 with a coupon) 
    I hate that I make excuses I want to quit. My set quit date after this final pack of camel red which should be Monday the 19th. Please wish me luck and give me some support.

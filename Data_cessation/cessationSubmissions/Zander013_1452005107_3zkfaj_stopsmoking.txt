Another 5 day quitter

Today marks my 5th day of not smoking. I only smoked for 3 years but god it feels like longer my mom and grandparents have been smoking my entire life. i started out at about half a pack a day and in the last year i moved up to a full pack a day if not a lil more.

These 5 days have been rough and since its been raining and cold where i am i haven't been able to go biking and try and workout outside. 

My reasons for quitting is to save up a lil money so i can afford to go to conventions and be a nerd so ive stuff to look forward to now that ive quit. (its hard to do stuff at conventions when you constantly feel like you need to be near a door to be able to smoke when you can.)

Im sure ill be around to update everyone once i get more time quit.

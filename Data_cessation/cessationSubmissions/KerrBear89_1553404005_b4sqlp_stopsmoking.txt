Smoke Free Quit Day 19 Mission - What Has Worked For Me

Well Iâ€™m a few days late with my missions so I thought Iâ€™d do this mission to the best of my ability and post it on here for you guys to see and comment on ðŸ˜Š

1. A break from alcohol - I decided the first month of quitting smoking I would also quit drinking and I have found this extremely helpful!!

2. Buying the Smoke Free App - This app is great! I like that it is interactive with daily missions so I donâ€™t just get bored of looking at it! I love that I can be honest with the app and say that I have smoked 2 smokes (oops ðŸ˜ž) and it records and keeps this information! I love ALL  of the features!

3. Concentrating on drinking water - when I really want a smoke I have a glass of water. When available, I have soda water with lemon.

4. Chewing gum - When it gets tough, gum is a great distraction! 

5. Nicotine free vape - When it gets extremely tough (usually social situations where others are smoking) the vape is great! I chose nicotine free as I do not want to get hooked on something else.

6. Going for a drive with my music blaring - music is so damn helpful, Iâ€™m thinking of keeping earphones with me constantly for when I cannot just go for a drive.

7. Going for a walk/exercise - concentrating on being healthy helps as it reminds you why you are doing this in the first place! Itâ€™s also a great way to take your mind off things and de-stress! 

8. Sharing - Talking to friends, family and even posting on here your true feelings and being honest with yourself! Itâ€™s a great feeling to open up and get things off your chest whether it be about quitting smoking or just general stress! 

Thanks for reading ðŸ˜Š

2 month check in

Hey all, I just realized I passed the 2 month mark!

I thought I'd take the chance to tell those considering or starting their quite to KEEP GOING! OMG! Come over to this life, it's amazing. So much less stress, so much less worry, so much less judgement (self imposed and by others). I've lost ten pounds and have regained almost all of my strength and stamina (20 mile bike + ball-busting leg workout this morning!). It seems insurmountable now, BUT IT'S NOT. The thoughts fade and you regret YOU DIDN'T DO IT EARLIER.

This quit was particularly weird for me. It took me a few months and very many tries. I wouldn't let myself give up though. The last time I finally did it was actually almost painless. Now my challenge is making sure this is the last on my quits (I've gone over a year before...). My biggest pothole will be very big life stressors involving loved ones (this last one was largely precipitated by the process of losing my father). I quit a few weeks after my loss, so I'm hoping I've made strides in convincing myself that nicotine just drags (pun intended) out the problem.

To end on a high note, it's amazing how much better working towards a healthier life is and how much it affects you elsewhere. I'm trying to cut out drinking now too, which I never thought I'd do. The motivation is simple - life appears to be brighter when you're not dependent on things :)

So come join me as I work to make this one last forever!

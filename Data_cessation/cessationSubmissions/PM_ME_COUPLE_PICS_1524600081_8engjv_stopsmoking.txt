Never was a smoker until I vaped

My ex, with whom I lived for a year and a half, got me into vaping I guess about 3 years ago. I have been a chain vaper since then. I know it's healthier than smoking, but now I'm addicted to nicotine and I absolutely hate it. 

In the past, when my vape has broken, I have bought cigarettes. Cigarettes mess me up a lot because I'm hypersensitive to stimulants, so I try to avoid actual smoking. I have wheezed at times and that's not fun. I went from 18mg nic when I first started vaping, and now I'm down to 6/3mg. I feel like buying 0mg nicotine would be a complete waste of money... so I'm thinking I will just quit cold turkey once I run out of vape juice. 

I always make excuses to quit like, "I just bought a new ____ not too long ago" whether it's a mod, a tank, coils, or juice. At this point, vaping isn't even enjoyable for me. I'm literally right about to be out of juice and am out of coils for my newer tanks (I have old coils for a tank I can't remember if works so that might be a crutch unless I throw them out). 

I kind of want to hang onto my vape in case I fail so I don't have to buy a new set-up, but... will it just tempt me? Idk. Tonight/tomorrow looks like it may be my first time trying to quit and last time vaping.

I'm nervous! Any words of wisdom or encouragement would be great.

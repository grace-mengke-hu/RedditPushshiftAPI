Worst craving ever

Today was rough, long hours at school and work, feeling grumpy all day.
I just arrived at the train station in my hometown, on my way home from school. When I exit the train, a huge craving attacked me. As I am writing this I am in a bus on my way home. Forcing myself not to buy cigarettes.

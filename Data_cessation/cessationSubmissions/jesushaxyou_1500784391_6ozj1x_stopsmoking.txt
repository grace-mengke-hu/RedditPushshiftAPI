So it's been a while since I've had a cigarette.


Hey guys, I know I never introduced myself to y'all before I, or as I, quit.

However, I'm currently working on day number 21 without a cigarette. Three weeks without a smoke. I kind of wanted to gloat about it without seeming like an ass hole lol.

I wore a patch for the first two days of my crusade. Basically until I reached the point where I can take my dog out without having a panic attack.

I never avoided my smoking situations. I didn't change my life to avoid the fact that I quit smoking. I faced it head on. Same habits, quitting the addiction.

It sucked for a bit. But I'm now three weeks smokeless. Ive enjoyed the ride so far. The anger and pain and sadness wouldn't have been so prevalent had I not been bettering myself.

Good luck everyone, we can all do it.

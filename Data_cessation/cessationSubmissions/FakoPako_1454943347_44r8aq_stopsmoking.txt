Had booze...didn't smoke...winning!

Yup. Went out with my friend. Didn't even think about smoking at all. Hell, I didn't even want to smoke! 

Feels good. Really good. 

I got my booze cravings out. Now back to the normal scheduled programming of eating healthy and using myfitnesspal. 

Almost at 40 days kids! We are awesome!

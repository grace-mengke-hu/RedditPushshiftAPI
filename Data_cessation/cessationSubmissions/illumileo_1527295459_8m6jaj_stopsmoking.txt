Help me quit for the sake of my two young ones.

His is my first post so go easy on me. I've been smoking for 10 years And I have tried everything to quit. I have tried vaping, medication, cold turkey, you name it. Every time I feel slightly stressed I got for the pack. I'm almost always stressed  due to a highly demanding job and being a single father. With my low levels of motivation I just can't seem to do it. Reddit, please help me. I will keep on visiting this sub and will avidly read, maybe something will click one day. I really want to do it for my kids, my 6 year old daughter keeps asking me to toss away my pack, And I would love nothing more, I just can't :(

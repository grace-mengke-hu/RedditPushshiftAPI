Funny feeling in throat.. does that happen?

Hi people. I am around my 22. day, and like for a week I feel something funny in my throat. It feels like I am just about to get a cold or flu, thanks God I never become really sick but that feeling stays there, poking at me. Is it something related with quitting smoking? Anyone experienced something similar?

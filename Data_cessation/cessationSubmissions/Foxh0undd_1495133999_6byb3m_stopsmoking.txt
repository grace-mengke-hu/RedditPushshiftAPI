Worlds Biggest Appetite

I'm verging on one month smoke free and I've noticed I'm eating so much more than usual and I'm worried I'm gonna end up ballooning! I've gone cold turkey so no vape, no gum, no patches, nothing so if you can recommend anything that may kick the cravings/stop me from eating EVERYTHING it would be massively appreciated

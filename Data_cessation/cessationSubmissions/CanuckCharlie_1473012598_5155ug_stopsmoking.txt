Just finished my last one!

Halfway through I just had this surge of confidence, I've been really hesitant and stupid about smoking for the past year that I've been thinking about quitting. I tossed my pack into the shed of "unknown things" so if I get the urge, I'd need to dig past weeks of forgotten trash and an old couch, oh right there's a shopping cart in there too.
Feeling good about myself and confident I can keep this up, getting my first badge rn.  -- btw thanks to this subreddit, i've become a lot more aware about this habit, It's given me tons of help.

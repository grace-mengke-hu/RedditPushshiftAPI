My godmother passed away from COPD 4 days ago.

My godmother passed away 4 days ago and shit I really miss her, I've never been a victim to death before as my grandma died of lungcancer from smoking when I was 4 so I don't really remember much, she died at 65.

 My godmother just had her 60th birthday 2 weeks ago. The last time I saw her which was this christmas we were talking about us going out and having sushi when the warm weather comes but by the time that warm weather hits it's going to be time for her funeral.

She was my moms best friend and my mom hugged me when she told me the news. She also thanked me for stopping her from smoking as she couldve been going down the same path if I didnt.  When I was little I always made a scene and cried everytime my mom came home and smelled like smoke after my grandma died and she got so riddled with guilt she quit smoking and she always said that was the best decision she has ever made.

I am so proud of this subreddit and I hope this sad stuff gives motivation to continue your journey. It will be the best thing you've ever done. Im rooting for you all.

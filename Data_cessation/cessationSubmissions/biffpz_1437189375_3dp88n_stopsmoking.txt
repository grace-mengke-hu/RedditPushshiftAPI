On expectations

**TL;DR** You will not realize anything after 72 hours (3 days) you quit. All this means is you are nicotine free. You are a non-smoker the minute you decide to smoke your last cigarette and extinguish that cigarette.

I quit cold turkey after finally reading Allen Carr's book and one of his points that really stuck with me is managing expectations.  

Yes, after 72 hours (or 3 days) from your last intake of nicotine, you will be 100% nicotine free. However, you won't just wake up and say "ahh, it has left me and that's it". The fact is that nicotine addiction results in chemical dependency. This means that your body (and specifically your brain) develops extra receptors to deal with the nicotine intake. [For up to 6 weeks after smokers quit, their brain cells have more nicotine-binding receptors than nonsmokers' cells do.](http://www.drugabuse.gov/news-events/nida-notes/2009/10/abstinent-smokers-nicotinic-receptors-take-more-than-month-to-normalize) This is what a craving is. You are starving these extra receptors your brain has created because you smoke.

There is no revelation where you suddenly realize "I no longer need it" or "I no longer think about it!". The truth is you will always think about it. You will see someone smoking and think "wow, that used to be me" or a smoker will come up to you and you'll smell that stale smoke and think "wow, that used to be me." Hell, I thought about it tonight. "I'm having a few beers, I can be one of those smoke when I drink guys". No, I can't, and besides, I told myself, "you wouldn't enjoy it now ANYWAY. That first drag you once thought so precious would taste like pure rubbish. Why go back to that?"

I know I'm only a little over a month clean, but managing my expectations was one of the things that really helped me. Anyways, thanks for reading if you did. Enjoy your smoke free weekend.

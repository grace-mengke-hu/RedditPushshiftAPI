1 year and 100 days!

I decided to randomly check my badge counter and found out I am exactly 465 days clean! Its amazing how fast time flies. I still remember how much I was struggling.. I had 5 failed attempts prior to this streak, so my hope was weak. But I decided to approach it in a different way. My motto: survive this day and we will see about tomorrow. And here I am surviving the 465th day except it doesnt feel like surving anymore. Even more , it has become the easiest thing in the world. 

I REALLY wanted to change. I REALLY wanted to live healthier. I REALLY wanted to save money. I REALLY wanted to smell better and tackle my other bad habits. And guess what? I fucking DID it. Just by ACTING on it. You cant decide from today on to tomorrow to quit. I requires a gameplan, what places, people to avoid, how to keep yourself busy etc. I believe that anyone can quit forever, you just have to REALLY want it. 

After smoking for 6 years, weed and tobacco, I can finally say I am not addicted anymore. BUT I will stay alert at ALL times and so should YOU. Have a great and blessed day!

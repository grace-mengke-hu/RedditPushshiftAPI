Getting stronger

Quite smoking 12/14 but had a cigarette 2 days later but haven’t had one since. Been one of the toughest weeks feeling like crap(headaches, nausea, stomach cramps, jitters, anxiety) so many feels of boredom and sadness I’m just looking forward to the passing days but it’s getting better

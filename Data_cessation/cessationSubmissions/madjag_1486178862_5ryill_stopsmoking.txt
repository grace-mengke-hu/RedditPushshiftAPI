Why having one, once in a while was the wrong way of quitting

I quit smoking January 2. Or so I told everyone. In fact, I told myself I'm not gonna smoke anymore, but just have one here and there, as a reward to cutting the habit. It worked, for a little while, until I walked into a liquor store and bought a pack. Now I know what y'all thinking, here he goes. But no, I had one, felt so guilty about buying the pack that I gave it to a bum. Made his night, I'm sure. However, it's crazy how I was always on the edge of full relapse, luckily I didn't. One thing I noticed, even one cigarette, felt it reset the entire cycle, and the day after was back to day 1. Anyhow, on day 3 today, so far so good. Stay strong friends, let's beat this.

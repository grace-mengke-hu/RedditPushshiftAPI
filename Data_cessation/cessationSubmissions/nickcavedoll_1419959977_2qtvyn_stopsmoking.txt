This is the final time!

I quit smoking like 10 times in the last 3 years. Some attempts lasted as much as 6 months, but eventually I'd go back to the demon weed. 

I'm going to be 30 this year and I'm just sick of this shit. Don't get me wrong I LOVE SMOKING. I truly, truly do. And in previous attempts to quit, I would say "oh, well it's gross and I hate it, blah blah blah." But I don't. I LOVE IT, and that's why it's so hard to stop. 

However, I got a DVT this year and I'm getting older and I really don't want to look like a wrinkled piece of tissue paper or, you know, get a blood clot and die any time soon. So this is fucking it. 

I'm going to miss you, cigs, but you're killing me and I'm fucking done.

5+ months!

Hi guys, very good news from myself, I'm 5 months cigarette-free!
By the way, it's really a strange path. You have to be extremely aware of yourself, mostly in the long term, to avoid falling into traps.

Craving are gone, sometimes some "memories" about the habit surfaces into my mind, but is all just a thought. 

The only thing that I saw that I have to stay alert to, are joints. And mostly the ones offered by friends, because they mix weed with tobacco. I smoke weed on a pseudo regular basis, but from the period I decided to stop smoking, I've switched to a weed vaporizer or if I want to smoke a joint, I fill it only with weed or I mix it with herbs like peppermint or CBD-only weed (THC &lt; 0.4%).
When smoking with friends those tobacco mixed for a regular amount of time, like once a week for a month(I have some smoking-guitar playing sessions in the weekends with them in the last month), those sessions gave me nicotine cravings. So if you smoke pot, be sure you can 90% of the time  have a nicotine free smoke. It is extraordinary how the tobacco contained in a joint can lead you to think that you always want to smoke weed(i.e. being so laced to the weed -&gt; addiction) but from the time I stopped smoking, I see that weed is not so addictive anymore. I like it but now I can stay free without cravings and is a good feeling. 

I am not stating that weed is not addictive, but that it is felt more addictive if you smoke regularly and with tobacco in it. 
My personal advice, if you like weed, is to switch to a vaporizer. 95% free of carginogen vapor, and you get high AF.

TLDR: if you like weed, avoid tobacco mixed joint as much as you can, it avoids unwanted cravings

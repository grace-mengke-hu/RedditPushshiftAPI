Wow I can't believe the stress I have endured today and didn't smoke.

Wow I can't believe the stress I have endured today. Its a police matter regarding someone with mental illness who has been bothering me for YEARS... And a bunch of other stuff.. Anyway... feel crappy, going to chill and watch tv and forget all about everything. I'm SOOOO happy I didn't smoke. Thank you everyone for your support.

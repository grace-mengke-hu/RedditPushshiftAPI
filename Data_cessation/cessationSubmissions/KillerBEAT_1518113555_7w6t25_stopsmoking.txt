Smoke free for 28 days, and my skin looks terrible.

Is this normal? I quit for 4 months back in May 2017 after smoking 1-2 packs a day for 5 years, and relapsed in October. In fact I still feel physically bad, hacking up crap, tired all the time. I don't remember it sucking this bad back in May. Now I DO feel overall better, but it could be better haha. Also maybe since I'm vaping too? It could have some correlation. Who knows.

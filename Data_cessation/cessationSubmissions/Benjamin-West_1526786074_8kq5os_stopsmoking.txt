Days after quitting smoking

I feel hazy and weird. Even though I am vaping a bit here and there to keep wds at bay, is it possible my body is still detoxing all the other chemicals? 
I feel very weird. Almost dizzy but not dizzy. And just maybe lethargic? I feel like I can’t focus on any thing item wise. Like I’m looking through things and people. Even if I make eye contact. Very strange. 

I know I’m still consuming nicotine. But I feel very strange and not like myself....

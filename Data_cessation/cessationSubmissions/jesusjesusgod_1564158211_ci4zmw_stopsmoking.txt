Quitting in a house full of smokers

So I know this is a stop smoking sub but I am a former vaper and I’m on day 5 of quitting right now. I’ve known I wanted to quit for a long time now and just recently got up the nerve to do it because I’m visiting my girlfriend who is studying abroad in France in a few weeks. She has always disliked me vaping and it’s one of the biggest reasons that I’m deciding to quit. 

I’ve made it through the physical stage mostly unscathed and my resolve to stay quit is very high at the moment. The thing that I’m worried about, however, is that when I go back to school in September I will be living in a fraternity house where 75% of the guys there are using Juuls constantly. That social pressure of everyone doing it was what got me hooked in the first place and I’m a little worried about the same thing happening again. Also, my girlfriend goes to a different school so I think that I will reason with myself that out of sight is out of mind and fall back into the pit again. 

 I want to be prepared and have a plan when I go back up so it will be less of a chance of relapsing. Does anyone have some strategies to deal with a situation like this that I can’t escape?

Wife is quitting smoking...how can I help her?

A little background. My wife is trying to quit smoking. She's been a smoker since she was a teenager and we're in our mid-thirties now, so she's probably been smoking a pack a day for 20 years at this point. She's quit for stints before; both times she was pregnant, and a couple of other times she's tried going cold turkey, or various forms of nicotine replacement (patches, vaping, etc). So far, nothing has stuck on a permanent basis. At this point she hasn't smoked a cigarette for 6 days and counting. I've never smoked in my life, so I have a hard time relating to what she's going through. It makes me feel kind of useless honestly. Hoping maybe some of the good people on here can give me some ideas about how I can help her.

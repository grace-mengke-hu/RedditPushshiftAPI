Broke my wrist, now i'm having serious cravings.

I broke my wrist earlier this week. Since then, i've been craving cigarettes more that I have in months. I don't know if its the stress, boredom from being off work, or what thats causing these cravings. I know I've made it this far and that I'm done with smoking, and am a non-smoker.

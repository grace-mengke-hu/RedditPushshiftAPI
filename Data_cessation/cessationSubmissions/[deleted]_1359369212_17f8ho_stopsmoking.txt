Quitting today, achy lungs be gone

Had my last one tonight after work. How do you get the badge beside your name? I like the idea of a visual indicator of your progress. Also, I'm going to take $10 each day for my pack a day habit and put it on a pile at home and watch it grow. It'll be nice to taste food again, and to kiss my girlfriend without feeling like I've got an awful taste in my mouth. Looking forward to this though I find it hard to think about going to work without wanting to smoke, that will be the biggest challenge. I work at a bar.

Well, I caved...Day 1 again.

I had five days under my belt, which hasn't been my longest quit, that was when I found out I was pregnant (stopped as soon as I found out, then lost the baby, and in bitter resentment started back up smoking) so not being too hard on myself. 

This work week should be less stressful and my kids are off to their dad's this week so I should be able to get the hardest part under my belt before they get back.  I did call the ASH line yesterday to get some resources, I'm going to pray when it/if it gets tough, and basically I'm going to stop putting smoking on a pedestal. They're only cigarettes for pete's sake! That was my problem last week, I was miserable because I really felt like I was missing out on something.  Lung cancer, I guess. My mind is weird. 

Anyway, I like this quote from Voltaire and I thought I'd share:

"It is difficult to free fools from the chains they revere."

We got this people!

Just overcame a big mental battle!

I'm really proud if myself. My husband and I are at the laundromat and I always go to the convenience store next door to buy a pack and something to drink. I stood there for three minutes trying to talk myself out of buying cigarettes and I did it! I won that big mental battle with myself. I feel like that's a huge hurdle I just jumped over.

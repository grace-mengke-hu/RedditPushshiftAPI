So I know this may have been asked before... (NSFW)

Hi fellow quitters, I've been off the fags for 15 days now and honestly haven't felt this good for a long time, I feel healthy again which is great!

Now I primarily quit because me and my girlfriend were going through a rough patch sexually speaking, and I read that quitting smoking can make your erections harder and more fulfilling.

So my question is after 15 days of ditching it, how long does it actually take for the circulation to increase again as there still hasn't really been a noticeable difference. For the record, I was a pack a day for the best part of 10 years.

Thanks and good luck quitting!

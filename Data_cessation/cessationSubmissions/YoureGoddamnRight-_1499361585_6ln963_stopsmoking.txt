Trouble sleeping since I quit

I had my last smoke Monday afternoon and have been vaping since then. Everything is going way better than I expected! I'm having no cravings, the smell of smoke actually makes me nauseous now and I can walk up the stairs without getting winded, yay! The only issue that I'm having is sleep. I smoke a bowl before bed every night and it usually knocks me out and I sleep right through until the morning. Since I quit I've been having issues falling asleep and then actually staying asleep. Is this normal? When does it end?

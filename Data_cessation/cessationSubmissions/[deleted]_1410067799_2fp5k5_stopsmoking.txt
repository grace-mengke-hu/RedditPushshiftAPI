Just sent a message to have my badge removed.

I told myself there is no such thing as just one cigarette. 

I had just had a small house fire, the fire department had just left. I was on my back porch and I picked up a butt of a cigarette that my boyfriend had discarded earlier that day. I knew it wouldn't make anything less stressful. I wasn't even craving one, but I lit it anyway. I smoked it, and it was horrible. Then the next day another butt, and the next I bummed a whole cigarette from someone at work. Then the next I smoked 3 and was hiding from my kids. Today I've smoked 5 and realized I have to admit to myself that I am no longer quit. I came here to remove my badge and face it. I failed.

My addiction is saying "Well 5 cigarettes is better than a pack a day." But I know that's not true, 0 cigarettes is my goal. I just need to start over.

Edit: My badge said 41 days, so I made it 37 days.

Quick question for the ones who managed to quit.

Alright so to start off i've been smoking for 4 years since i was 16 to 20.(10 or less a day, didn't smoke much)   I started to work out a bit this past year and decided to quit as i felt working out was pointless while still on the cigarettes.  I quit about 2 and half weeks ago and noticed that i become out of breath while working out a lot quicker than i used to when i smoked.  Thought this was weird since i figured it would be the opposite.  Any other people experience this? could this be caused by anxiety? I'm just hoping its not some new health problem of some sort as i'm getting my wisdom teeth out in a week,  don't want any problems with that.

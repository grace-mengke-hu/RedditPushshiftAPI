Withdrawal symptoms are different than last time?

About like 3 months ago I was smoking daily for about a year, and then I quit cold turkey. The withdrawal was terrible, but really only consisted of intense cravings, tingling, severe constipation, and trouble sleeping. I went back onto cigarettes about 2 months later, but limited myself a lot (and recently quit, again). However, the symptoms I am experiencing are completely different, and are affecting my student lifestyle.

Instead, I am always tired and have this feeling in my chest thats this like aching/sore feeling that, quite literally, makes me feel really tired and I have a lot less energy. In a way, it makes me feel hungry as well, but I doubt its any sort of cravings. Any wise people could give me some pointers/tips on regaining my energy? 

I eat breakfast every morning.
I try to consume some coffee to be mentally awake.
I try my best to get a good 7-9 hours a day of sleep, regardless (but still feel really tired)
I eat daily vitamins
I try to drink a lot of water.
I cut out soda.
etc.

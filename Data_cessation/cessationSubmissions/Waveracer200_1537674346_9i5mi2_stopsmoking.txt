Weight gain; Does your body return to normal without exercise and changing your diet?

I noticed there was not to much conversation about this. I honestly did not look to hard though on reddit just noticed from looking at everyone's posts. I did find a lot about it on the internet. They all say, of course, to avoid it eat better and exercise (No shit lol). However, lets face it many of us have busy lives (me I am a half time student full time job and 2 other side jobs). Some people even quit because we are trying to save money and not to spend it. Eating healthy costs a lot more money then the normal pb and j sandwich and pasta(aka college diet.) I also live on a boat so fruits don't last long in the tropical heat plus I have a small fridge. I don't want to have to keep going out all the freaking time do buy more food.  I don't have that kind of time. I really have not changed the way I eat. However, of course, I am gaining weight and the reason why is also explained in many videos. They do not get into this question though. My first question is does your body adjust and eventually go back to your old weight? That is without working out/eating super healthy and staying on your same diet as before; assuming you do not all of a sudden eat like crazy and junk food? Is it critical to work out and eat right to return to your normal weight before you started smoking? My first question is what has your experiences been with this issue?Any long term ex-smokers know this answer?  Yes, I know quieting smoking and gaining weight is far better then not quitting smoking; we know! lol (I heard that one a lot on the YouTube videos also and that statement drives me nuts) .

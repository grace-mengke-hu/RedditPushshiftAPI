how to count

I thought I was a chain smoker. I examined my ash tray and I had smoked 13 cigarettes. But four of them were halves. And six of them were only shortened a quarter or less. Two were smoked and one was a butt. So I actually had only smoked at most seven. So, then I'm not a chain smoker. Apparently I'm addicted to lighting a cigarette and letting it burn and then forgetting it and lighting another. So should I just put the cigarette out when I don't feel like smoking it anymore?

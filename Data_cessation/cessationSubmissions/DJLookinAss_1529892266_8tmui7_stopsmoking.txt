Craving from hell—need some backup!

I’m on day 9 and wow, this is the worst craving I’ve had so far. It’s gone on almost an hour now. I’ve been 21 hours without nicotine (I’ve gone 72  consecutive hours without nicotine during this quit, but the past few days have been very stressful personally and emotionally, so I hit the vape a few times). 
Any kind words would be appreciated, sometimes it helps just to read positive comments!

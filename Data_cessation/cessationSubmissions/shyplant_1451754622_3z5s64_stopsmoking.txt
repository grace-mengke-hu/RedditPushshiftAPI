I'm only 16, it's time.

Hi guys,

I started smoking spliffs when I was about 14, typically around one a day which surprisingly didn't leave me with withdrawal cravings at all. 

I started smoking in Summer 2014 when I spent a month in Vienna. God damn is smoking a social lubricant! I loved smoking there and continued smoking when I got back home - around 4-5 cigarettes a day, sometimes less, sometimes more. 

In all, I've been smoking cigarettes for about 6 months. My new years resolution has sort of gone to shit because both my parents smoke, so today I ended up smoking a spliff whilst craving cigarettes fairly mildly.

I am scared. I honestly am.
Is it really harder to quit the longer you smoke? 
How long will these cravings last? bah... I feel like I need reassurance that it really isn't so difficult. 

Whatever it is, I haven't had a cigarette in under 24 hours apart from a spliff. I'm not touching these again.

EDIT: Smoked half a cigarette. Did not enjoy it at all. I am so tempted to just continue smoking... I am looking at pictures of Martha Argerich, a famous pianist who has smoked since young - and she looks so beautiful when she smokes... I hate my romanticism of this. It really is disgusting and misled.

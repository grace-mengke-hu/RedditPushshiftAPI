I'm just sitting here crying... ignore me..

A week. 

I don't think you guys realize what you have helped me do. 10 years I have smoked. 10 YEARS. A pack a day.

I woke up this morning, and I could BREATHE. I don't cough anymore. I am so thankful for every nice comment you guys have given me.

I know people say "If I can do it, you can do it..." But it is VERY true in my case.

I'm proud of each one of you!

I know I have a long road ahead of me, still. But this was my first goal.

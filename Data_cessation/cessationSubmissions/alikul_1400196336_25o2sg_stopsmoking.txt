My mind's in a bad place, a REALLY bad place !

I've stopped smoking 43 days ago. Started swimming somewhat regularly and after the first month I bought a bike with the amount I saved and started pedalling pretty often. 

I've always had some vague issues involving anxiety and being proned to depression and such, which I didn't face much trouble keeping it to myself. Just the typical somewhat socially anxious 20something guy.

But in the last two weeks I've turned into a really fucked up kid. I'm :

- constantly anxious;

- always mad on most persons i care for;

- in a continuous fight with me, never being sure of anything;

- feeling restless;

- unable to have a decent day without getting paranoid over every small aspect of life and how much it sucks; also obsessing over past bad events;

- lack of interest in anything;

...the list goes on. It's like there's somebody else controlling me; I've developed fears I never thought exist;

  Could this all be a part of the nicotine-withdrawal period ? If so, I'm not really sure if I'm strong enough to keep going for an unsettled amount of time... 

  I hate everything. I miss the old me... 

  Help.

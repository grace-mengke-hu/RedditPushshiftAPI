Relapsed at the 24hour mark for the second time

Interestingly, I smoked one not when I was feeling the cravings the most, but when they were moderate, and I could've easily not given in.

Yeah, it feels bad right now, because I sure would've loved to see the "1 day" badge.

Anyway. I'm going to try again tomorrow.

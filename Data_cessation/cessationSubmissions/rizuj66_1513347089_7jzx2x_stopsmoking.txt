Travel risk

136 days and my first overseas trip since quitting coming up.  Smoking was always my crutch as a solo traveller. It's something to do when waiting around, and when you need to look 'busy' doing something/ not wanting to engage with anyone around you. And in France where I'm going, so many people smoke!!  This is going to be a serious challenge.  The one good thing is that it's so fricking cold that I won't want to be standing outside Smoking, like I always used to have to do! Will just have to find something else. Maybe glue myself to my Kindle... Hope.i can get thru OK. Wish me luck...

Day 4 - The world is sunny and bright

First of all, thank you, seriously thank you to all of the wonderful people who gave me advice and encouragement yesterday.  It really pulled me through a day of absolute and total weakness, and I made it to day 4!!

I know I'm not out of the woods yet, but I woke up this morning feeling like a million bucks.  I don't have the urge to smoke a cigarette (bf bought me a really nice vape last night, and I'm only taking occasional puffs on it throughout the day), and already feel like my skin looks better.  The black circles under my eyes are gone, and I feel alert and focused, a complete contradiction to how I felt yesterday.

I know I'm not out of the woods yet, and this weekend will be a challenge for me (I plan on staying home and playing video games, just to help me get through).  I know I'll need to re-enter the world and learn to live cigarette-free eventually, but for now, I just want to be able to sit at home and meditate on what this means to me, and how much brighter my future will be!

To all of you struggling today, it will get better!!! Human beings are fighters, so rage and fight and break through to a better day tomorrow!

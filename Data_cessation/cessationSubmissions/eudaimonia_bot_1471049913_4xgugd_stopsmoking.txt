Stopsmoking chatroom.

I'm not sure if anyone else is interested but there is now a #stopsmoking IRC room.

The room is not directly affiliated with this subreddit, I have not asked the mods permission, but hopefully they suppport this idea.

The room is located on snoonet, that is irc.snoonet.org 6667 or you can reach the room by going here:

http://snoonet.org/webchat 

in your web browser. You'll have to learn how to use IRC to register a nickname and such, of course, if you aren't familiar with IRC.

This chatroom needs mods and participants! Now is the time to build a strong community to help people stay smoke-free, I think.

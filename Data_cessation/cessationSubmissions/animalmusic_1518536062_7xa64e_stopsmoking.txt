We are looking for someone who uses an electrolarynx and is musically inclined for a anti-smoking PSA.

Hey guys, the company I work with is working on an anti-tobacco campaign and are seeking someone who requires an electrolarynx to speak due to smoking-related illnesses and is musically inclined.

I can't give out too much info on the project itself publicly and I know its an odd request but its for a good cause that will hopefully help people understand the dangers of long-term smoking.

If you or anyone you know even remotely falls in line with this request, don't hesitate to reach out via PM.

Best of luck to anyone trying to overcome smoking addiction on this sub, I've seen many people overcome it and its always worth the initial struggle if you stick to it!

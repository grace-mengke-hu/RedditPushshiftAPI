Why did I do that

You guys!!!! Today was absolutely terrible. I come home from work to some insane argument between my boyfriend and my parents. They are all screaming and some of my parents friends are there trying to help calm them down. I had no idea what was happening.. I start getting yelled at about what is going on by 3 different people and I started having a panic attack because of it. I walk inside and grab my dog, go to the store and buy a pack of cigs... I took 3 hits of one before I realized what the fuck I was doing and immediately put it out. I feel terrible that I automatically went to smoking to try and calm down. Should I reset my quit date? I was so proud of my progress and I even got a compliment today on how I have a glow since quitting :(

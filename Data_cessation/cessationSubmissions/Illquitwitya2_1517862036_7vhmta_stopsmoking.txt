Whoever said coke tastes better was right.

Also whisky and whiskey. Why did no one tell me this until recently? Everything else has been sort of like, "yeah the carrots taste more carroty than before, huzzah." But I'm tasting entirely new things with bourbon and scotch. I'm excited to try some old favorites. Good thing I'll be able to afford them now that I'm saving $6.50 a day. It's only been 8 days. Looking forward to the rest of it.

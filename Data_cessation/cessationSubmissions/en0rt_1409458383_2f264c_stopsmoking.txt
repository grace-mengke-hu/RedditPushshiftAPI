Day 8 and I am having a bit of a hard one.

Yesterday was great, it was my first week in 13 years without a smoke ever. Felt good, confident, happy and enjoying things. 

Woke up today, bit of a shit mood. It has progressed as the day has gone on. Missing my ex wife (from 2 years ago) like crazy. Everyone is annoying the living shit out of me. Basically been wrestling with demons all day. 

I have beer in the fridge I could drink to maybe calm myself down a bit, but I am scared that if I have a couple of beers I will just have a smoke and then hate myself. 

I guess I just gotta stick it out. I have had a bad day like this earlier this week, i thought that would have been my only one. How long do these dark days usually last? Can I expect days like this for the next 2 years? or will i feel a bit more on top of things in say... 3 weeks?

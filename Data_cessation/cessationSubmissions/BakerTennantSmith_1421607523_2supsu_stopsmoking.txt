Skin issues after quitting

I am on Day 9.....yay!! I am curious. How long after quitting did it take for your skin (face particularly) to start looking better? It looks so bad right now, which I know is due to detox. I'm drinking a lot of water (About 2 liters a day), training for a 10K 3xs a week and my appetite is returning to normal. No alcohol, some caffeine, etc. Smoking makes skin look so bad and I'm hoping to start seeing improvement soon.

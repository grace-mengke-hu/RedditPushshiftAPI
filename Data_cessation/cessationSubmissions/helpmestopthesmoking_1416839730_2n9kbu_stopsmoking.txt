Your support made a difference - I'm 57.5 hours in!

Thank you for the outpouring of support to my initial thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/2mrvib/help_me_desperately_trying_to_quit_for_my_family/)

I'm currently two days in, partway through my third.

I made the mistake of researching the "timeline" of stopping smoking last night, and learned that today is supposed to be the worst of all, which got me so anxious, I got zilch for sleep last night, and here I am at work today. Just about ready to punch everyone, but I have my tic tacs, ice breakers, water, tea, apple juice and rescue remedy all lined up on my desk so I can make this work.

I am never, ever, EVER doing this again. Never. Going through withdrawal, for me, is super excruciating Like, I hurt. And I'm trying to be careful because I don't want too much stress to harm my little one, so deep breaths, lots of water, as much sleep as possible and I'm just trying to keep my mouth shut so I don't offend the people around me!

Thanks for your support - I could use more kind words, if you've got 'em!

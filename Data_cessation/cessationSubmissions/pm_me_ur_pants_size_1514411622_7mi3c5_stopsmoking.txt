How do I convince my grandma to not smoke?

My grandma came up for the holidays and everyone thinks she's quit smoking but she haven't. She told me she smokes with my great aunt back home. She's been at my house for 4 days without smoking and now she's begging me to buy her cigs. I keep on telling her no and that she's been doing good and she doesn't need them.  But she doesn't take no for an answer and I feel terrible buying them for her because everyone thinks she is not smoking, and I'm enabling her too. 

Advice?

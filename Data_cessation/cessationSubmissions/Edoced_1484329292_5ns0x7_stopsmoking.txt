Today's the day

I'm twenty-one, I've smoked for two years, and I'm tired of it. I'm tired of the smell, I'm tired of brushing my teeth after every cigarette to avoid the bad breath, I'm tired of not being able to jog a few feet without feeling my lungs tighten.

I'm tired of moving my way into the future, of looking for a job and replacing every disappointment with a cigarette. I'm tired of replacing my boredom with nicotine. I'm tired of not developing new hobbies, going out, or even just getting up and cooking a decent meal, because why bother if you can just replace whatever urges you have with a sense of accomplishment by going outside and saying, "Hey look, today wasn't a total waste, I spent time outdoors smoking!" 

Smoking has legitimately made me depressed, taken a toll on my athleticism, and rendered me a slave to addiction. 

I'm tired of it. 

I just finished my last pack. 

Pray for me, folks.

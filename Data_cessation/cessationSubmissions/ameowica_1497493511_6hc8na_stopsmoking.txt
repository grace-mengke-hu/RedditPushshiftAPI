Minor achievement

I went to my local mart today where I usually buy cigarettes. I've lived across the street from it for two years and have probably stopped by 4-7 times a week for the last two years because I had to buy cigs. Today I went in for a soda and one of the guys that works there came back from vacation after a month (about how long I've quit) and said "my brother said you haven't been here very much what's going on?" And I told him I quit smoking. I didn't realize how much I went in there today and it was kind of funny walking in and getting that reaction. Only a minor win but if your local business notices your absence then something must be changing!

stop smoking free text messages

so i had signed up for smoke free text messages through nyc.gov and they would text me everyday and send me some words of encouragement... it was very helpful and i recommend it to anyone who needs a daily pick me up... but after like a month apparently they feel like you dont need encouragement anymore and they take you off the text list... does anyone know of an app or another text message service that sends/gives daily encouragement because i think they are wrong and i still need it..thank you in advance for any help!

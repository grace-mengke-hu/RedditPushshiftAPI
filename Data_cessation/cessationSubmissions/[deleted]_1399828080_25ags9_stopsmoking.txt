Quitting For Good

I've been smoking steadily for the last 8 years and I'm only in my mid twenties. I'm on the patch now and would rather bash my head in a wall than be addicting to smoking anymore. Day 1 and i got a piece of paper by my door to remind me where ill write down how many days free of smoke! Wish me luck, and good luck to you!

Wow this is hard!

Hello peeps! First real attempt to quit cigs here, and holy wow it's hard. I didn't realize how ingrained the feeling of withdrawal was. I feel it now and think "Oh, there's that feeling, let's have a smoke!" before realizing that's what I'm not doing and feeling silly. I gave up alcohol 9 months ago and I guess I forgot how hard it was, this is reminding me of what I used to do then. Just say no, you're better than this. That seems to help, but holy fuck do I want to punch someone lol. 

I never realized how many triggers I had. Driving. Eating. Watching someone on TV smoke. Seeing a no smoking sign. 

I should have maybe put some thought into this besides Sunday right before I closed my eyes to sleep thinking "I'm gonna give quitting smoking a serious attempt tomorrow!". I went with my word but fuck this bites for right now. It's hard, but I won't smoke. 

Stay strong fam!

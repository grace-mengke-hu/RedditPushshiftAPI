badge reset

Two years ago, due to stress, death in the family, I fell back into old habits and slowly started smoking again after having quit for over a year. Recent health issues of unknown origin have me feeling very mortal and stopping again in short order. Resetting the badge. Starting over.  So easy to stop smoking, so hard to not start again.

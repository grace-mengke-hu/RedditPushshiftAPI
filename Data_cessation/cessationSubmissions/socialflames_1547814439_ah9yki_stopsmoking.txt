a calendar I made when I was quitting

A while back I made a calendar to help me when I was quitting smoking. 

I've quit many times, now I've been nicotine free for maybe a year and a half. 

This calendar is based on information I found online about how the body reacts when quitting smoking, and as you guys can see, it's mixed in with some silly motivational text. The scientific side is probably not quite as specific as the calendar suggests, so it's worth mentioning that it shouldn't be treated as a highly specific scientific source, more as a general motivational aid if someone might want to use it. 

The way it's structured suggests starting quitting on a Monday (which is also why the weekends are more dramatic, many people go out partying/drinking on weekends, and this is a common trigger), but you can just cross that out and write in whatever day you start with and take it at that if you want. 

A good chunk of the motivational text is based on my personal observation of how smoking affected my sense of time (time was chopped up between cigarettes).

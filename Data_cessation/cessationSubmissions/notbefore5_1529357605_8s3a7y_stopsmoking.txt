Self-deceptions in my attempt to stop

Just thought I'd share some of the self-deceptions that have played a role in preventing me to stop smoking previously. Beware of these. Hope this helps.

Deception #1: **Stopping smoking will make me a better person and make my other problems go away**

This one seems harmless, and may actually be helpful in making the initial decision to stop. Of course, stopping smoking is a positive step. However, you need to look at this decision in isolation, and not associate the initiative to any other challenges in your life. You will eventually encounter difficult circumstances in your attempt to stop. The addictive voice in your mind will come up with something like - "See - it's not working. Stopping smoking didn't fix anything. Life is still hard, and you are still a failure. Might as well have a smoke. You can stop smoking when you're ready to make real improvements in your life."

Deception #2: **I have already decided to have a smoke. There is nothing I can do now. The game is lost. I'll stop next time**

As you're debating with yourself on whether to have a smoke in a challenging situation, you may at some point decide that you have lost the battle, and you need to have a smoke. You will pretend like you are still unsure, but you will know that the decision is made and you will get that smoke. You may notice a smile creeping up in anticipation. STOP! It's not too late at this point. Let this smile or this thought be a reminder of the self-deception that's happening.

Deception #3: **I smoke less than others, I'm still young, I still have time**

This may be true, but this excuse will inevitably lead to you smoking hundreds or thousands more cigarettes. This is essentially equivalent to the "I can just have one more" camp. You're not gaining anything by having any more cigarettes. Stop now.

Deception #4: **Smoking is the greatest thing in the universe. Prove me wrong.**

Don't argue with yourself whether or not smoking was a positive or a negative, or if it it would be a positive if not for the health affects, or if this or that or the other.

Your job after you stop is simply to condition yourself away from smoking. Associate smoking with SHITTY AWFUL things in your mind consciously. Self-deception works both ways. Convince yourself that smoking sucks. Repeat the "not a single more puff" mantra.

Deception #5: **You can change your decision about this.**

You only decide to do something if you decide that it's the ONLY thing that you are going to do. Returning back to smoking is not an option. Don't entertain it or consider it. The decision has been made. You are now a nonsmoker.

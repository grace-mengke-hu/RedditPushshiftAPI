I smoked again and feeling like shit

Hey, how are you all doing? I have to tell you a story, after three weeks i smoked 1 after work than another day after work than i was drinking some beer and smoked. And then i was back to Smoking 5-8 per day for this Weekend. It was so fast and i was back at it :/. Now i reset my app. I feel so ashamed... :(. That fucking nicotine i pulls you down so fast.. 1 Cig gets to 2 then 3 then 5. I really want to Quit. But now im feeling like a fucking Loser who was destroyed Boy the nicotin monster. 
But I have learned one thing, one puff and im back at it. At first after 3 weeks it was so digusting but after 3 cig. it felt „normaly“. 
I have fear for my new try, will it be harder? 
But now i feel like a total Loser.

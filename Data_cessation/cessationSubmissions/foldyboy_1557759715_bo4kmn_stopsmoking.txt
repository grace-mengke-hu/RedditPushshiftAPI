I never thought I'd be able to drive without smoking

I started smoking one or two a day/socially when I was 20 working in food service. 3 years later I got a job doing construction that involved me driving to remote sites a lot, that's when my smoking really picked up to over a pack a day. 

In the remaining 7 years I went down to less than a pack a day, but the several times I tried to quit what would always get me was smoking while I drove. I just 'needed' to do it, so I'd start with one or two, or 'just on long trips' and then I was smoking again. 

I'm at 3 weeks now and I just realized I haven't even thought about smoking in my car for about 2 of those weeks. I just kind of 'forgot' that it was an issue I guess.

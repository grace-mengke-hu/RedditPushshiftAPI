Last Pack.

I've been smoking for about a year and I can tell. I cough so much because I smoke and have asthma. I kinda used it as a crutch for my anxiety and depression but I want to get in shape. I want my lungs to be able to keep up with what I'm doing. So after this pack, since my mom just bought this pack and I don't want to waste her money, I'm going to quit. It's becoming a financial toll as well. (That's why I stated that since she already bought them, I don't want to waste them.) Wish me luck guys.

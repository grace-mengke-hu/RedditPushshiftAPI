1 is never just 1

I stopped smoking for 6 months and I’ve been smoking for over 10 years. Recently I had a stressful situation and I bought a pack with the idea of being able to stop again quickly after. I threw out the pack with 20 left and went a day without wanting one. Now I’m back to work and just ran all over the place so I could buy another pack. I’m from Australia so it cost me $38 for a 30 pack (I know) so here I am again with a new pack and i know i don’t want it but my will power is at a major low right now.

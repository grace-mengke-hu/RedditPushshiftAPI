One of the best things about being Cig Free for this first winter in over a decade:

I am coming up on 2 months of freedom and what is keeping me going today is my winter coat.  I don’t have to worry how bad it smells or try to spray myself with for breeze when I come back in the house at family get-togethers. I don’t have to put it on 10 times a night to go out into the cold. I don’t have to be embarrassed for the way I smell. It feels so amazing to smell my clothes. I am so happy I stopped and I wish all of you luck and strength. We got this!!!

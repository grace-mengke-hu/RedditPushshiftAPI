Thoughts on day 4

I woke up feeling like I had actually caved and smoked a bunch the night before. My lungs were tight. You all know how badly my mind is trying to convince me that it is okay to buy a pack.
I've been hiding my smoking from my gf, and I am pretty ashamed. How she sees me is should be how I am.

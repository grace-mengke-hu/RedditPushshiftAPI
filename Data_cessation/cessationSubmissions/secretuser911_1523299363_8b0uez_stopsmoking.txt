Day 3 Hell and Craving Hack

Hi All. So this weekend I got a hangover so bad it prompted me to not only stop drinking for a month but also to go vegan and stop smoking. 

I’m on day three no smoking. I’m 31 and have smoked since I was 18 with a 6 month quit when I was 27.

I know at this point I’ve got to suck it up and power through. 

I don’t want to smoke today per se but I feel so on edge - like I’m itching from the inside out. I’ve had rage and crying today. 

But small hack. I’ve discovered that tomato juice with nearly half a bottle of hot sauce and pepper seems to calm me down/ease cravings. 

Also smell is back with a vengeance too. Trying to explain to a friend who has never smoked how intense quitting is is frustrating but I know they are supportive. Anyhoo - congrats to all the non smokers here! 

(Seriously - get some some hot sauce!)

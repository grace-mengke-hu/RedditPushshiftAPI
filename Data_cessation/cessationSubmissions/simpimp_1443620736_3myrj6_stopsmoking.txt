A new try

My flair should be reset to 5 days. Not because I fell of the wagon once and smoked one cig. I fell off the wagon two years ago and haven't been in this sub since then. I smoked about 500 packs of cigs in that time.  

I could have had over a thousand days.. I don't, I only have 5. Let's try again.

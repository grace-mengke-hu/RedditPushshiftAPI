The true benefit to quitting smoking.

There are plenty of benefits to quitting smoking such as saving money, reducing risk of cancer, bad breath etc. But it seems no one ever mentions the benefit that affected me the most: waking up early.

Since I quit, I noticed I started waking up at 7 am every day. I don't even have to force myself to wake up, it just happens. It's amazing. No more groggy feels, no more hitting the snooze button 5 times, no more rushing to work last minute still half asleep.

The benefits from this don't stop here, though. I'm filled to the brim with energy throughout the entire day. Before I quit, I had a habit of putting off responsibilities until the last minute or until it's too late. Now I clean the house regularly, call companies to handle issues I may be having (e.g. calling insurance to lower rates), send outgoing mail that needs to go out. I don't even have to force myself to do it. I just get it done.

The best part? I go to the gym consistently and stay longer than I had before. I'm starting to gain weight and put on muscle (I was skinny/underweight). I've never felt better and more confident in myself.

The other best part? I have energy to work on side projects (web development) I've been wanting to work on for a long time now. Maybe one of these projects becomes successful and I can start that business I've always wanted. If this business becomes successful and I start living my childhood dreams, I can attribute it to one specific thing: quitting smoking.

Note: If you are wondering how I quit smoking; I read "The Easy Way to Quit Smoking", by Allen Carr.

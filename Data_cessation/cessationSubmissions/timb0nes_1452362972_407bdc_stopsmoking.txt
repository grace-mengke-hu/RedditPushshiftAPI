2 years!

Today marks two years since I quit.  That's something like $5000 I was able to spend on tools, and guitars, and vacations that I would have just spent on smokes.

It's good to be free.

If you're thinking about quitting, make a plan and do it.  I started out just quitting for a day and then kept moving the goalposts.  Now here I am; I can hardly believe it.

I smoked for 20 years.  If I can quit, you can too.  It's hard but so worth it.

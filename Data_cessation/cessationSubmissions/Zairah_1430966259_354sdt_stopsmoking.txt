70 days. If I can do this anyone can.

I can't believe I'm a non smoker. Seriously. I had never tried to quit before. I smoked a pack a day for close to 20 years. Since quitting my life has been.....crazy... various huge not so good stressful events. I choose not to smoke anyhow. 

I am 100 percent confident I'll never pick up another smoke. I still have moments that I hard core want one, but at this point it's just annoying and not a craving a take seriously.  

I wish I had of quit 19 years ago. It's never too late though, everyone can do this! !!!

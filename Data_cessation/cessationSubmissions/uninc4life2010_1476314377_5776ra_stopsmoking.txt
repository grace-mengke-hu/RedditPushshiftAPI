I feel disappointed in myself.

I recently started smoking again after being clean for nearly a year.  I found that the stresses of school were sometimes eased by having a smoke.  I say sometimes because when I actually did have a cigarette, I usually felt disappointed in my lack of self-control, in addition to the bad feeling that cigarettes gave my body in general.

Now that it has been a full 24 hours since my last smoke, I've started to feel their pull.  I walked past a convenience store today and nearly went inside to pick up a pack.  I could hear this little voice in my head telling me, "Come on, you deserve it.  Remember how good they used to make you feel?  Just go inside so you can have one.  You deserve it with all of the hard work you've been putting forth. Just go in and get a pack."  Somehow, I was able to shake off that craving, but it was undeniable there.  I feel like this is what heroin addicts must go through, only if they decide to use again, they go completely bankrupt, get evicted from their homes, have to dig through trash on the street, become ostracized from their friends and family, and lose any employment opportunities. When I start smoking again, I just feel bad about myself and have trouble breathing without discomfort, so I'm not sure if I'm in a position to complain. 

I just wanted to share this.

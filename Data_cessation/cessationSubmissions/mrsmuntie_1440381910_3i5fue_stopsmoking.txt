Not buying more cigarettes after tonight. What do you do when your spouse hasn't quit?

I have decided to quit smoking (again). I've been successful in the past up to not smoking for a few YEARS, then I will relapse. My husband is a smoker and he is not yet ready to quit. 

I just feel like I'm 43 years old and need to live a healthier life in many regards. Basically I"m just looking for support here :) 

Edited to add that I have one cigarette left in my pack and have resolved not to buy more. So is today Day Zero or tomorrow?

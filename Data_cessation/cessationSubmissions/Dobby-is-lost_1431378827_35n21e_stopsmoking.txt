Please help! Question about Allen Carr's Easy Way

I started reading his book two days ago after a few suggestions to pick up Easy Way. I have now started smoking more! I have not finished the book yet, but I'm wondering if this has happened to any one else?!?! I feel like a lost cause! What the hell is wrong with me??????

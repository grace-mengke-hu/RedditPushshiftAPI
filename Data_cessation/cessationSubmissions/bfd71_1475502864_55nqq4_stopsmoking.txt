Wife is finally on board too, hoping two is stronger than one has been

The wife finally decided she was ready to quit smoking.  The last time she decided she was finally ready to do something out-of-the-blue was when she told me she was ready for a kid, two month later we had a zygote in place.  Hopefully, we'll be just as successful this time.

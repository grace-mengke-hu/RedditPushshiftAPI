Nightmares

First of all I just want to thank the entire r/stopsmoking community. I have lurked on here for a long time and after delaying it for a long time i decided to quit on Monday.
Monday night was fine but both Tuesday and Wednesday night i have had extremely horrific and realistic nightmares.

Iv had a few guys at work who have tried quiting with aids like the gums and patches ect and have said they haven't experienced anything like that.
Just wondering if anyone else has experienced this because iv never had such vivid and realistic dream

All cigarettes do, is make us not need a cigarette for a little while.

I mean, when i first started, i got a little whoosh of relaxation, head tingly. But that quickly went away and addiction set in. Struck me last week when some people at work were discussing why they like "their brand" and i realized it was all bullshit.

Im not going back this time. I don't see why i would.

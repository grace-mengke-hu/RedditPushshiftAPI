Breathing a Little easier; Day 18 (what works for me)

I would say this is my 3rd time trying to quit. I smoked more than half a pack a day (10-15 cigarettes and more on weekends/when drinking) for about 8 years. I didn’t even really plan for it this time; the timing just worked out. I happened to finish the pack around 10:45 one night and just decided I wanted to be done (in a wave of anger toward my addiction as is easy to come across when you’re riding that nicotine high). 

I definitely didn’t think it through or even give myself a chance to. Maybe that’s been part of my success? It actually reminds of something I read last year about the 5 Second Rule (Mel Robbins). It’s a great read and interesting  philosophy, so here’s the link:

 In case you don’t read it, it’s basically about changing how we function and make decisions. Rather than relying on (bad) habits where we have come up with plenty of excuses for ourselves, it focuses on making a (good) decision and acting on it within 5 seconds,  before our brains can get a word in. For example, if you’re constantly hitting snooze in the morning, immediately upon waking, make a decision to get up and DO IT RIGHT AWAY. Don’t let your brain get the chance to talk you out of it. It’s actually very interesting and I can see how it would be effective. 

Anywho, my husband had quit about a month before, none of my friends smoke, and although my brothers and mom all smoke, they live halfway across the country. I was tired of feeling weak and although I wasn’t really ashamed of being a smoker, I was more embarrassed of not being able to beat this thing. 

I’m really proud of how far I’ve come and I really am starting to enjoy my life without cigarettes. It still crosses my mind, but I’m pleasantly surprised at how effective my coping list/tools has been working. Don’t get me wrong, I know there will still be tough days ahead, but it’s good to use the positivity when it’s there! Here are some things that work for me. 

For me it’s a long list and a combination of things. Definitely all about breaking old routines and creating new healthy habits. Perseverance, positivity and consistency have been huge! Also, after the first few weeks of working through cravings, I quit letting my brain go there. If smoking crosses my mind I just tell myself “Nope, don’t even think about it, it’s not worth it!” and then I do one of the things listed below.

-Smoke Free app (I paid the $4.99 for the upgrade. I’m not usually into self help/journaling apps, but this was great for reminding me that I made a promise to myself and to be consistent. I plan to continue to use it until I’m past the one month mark). 
-no coffee or alcohol for the first 2 weeks (and sparingly after)
-chewing gum
-creating a new daily routine and sticking to it!
-daily exercise (walk, HIIT, yoga, etc)
-read
-listen to podcasts
-research/think about passions and/or new hobbies
-doodle (for the first 5 days I drew pictures and wrote thoughts on one piece of paper)
-healthy meal prep
-lots of water
-a healthy and tasty water alternative (tea, La Croix, flavored water)
-talk with a family member or friend
-remember why I quit/why I don’t want to start from square one ever again!
-deep breathing
-plenty of sleep

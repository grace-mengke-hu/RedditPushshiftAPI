200 days: 4,000!!!! cigarettes NOT smoked and Â£2,000 not spent on lining tobacco executives pockets. Winner winner chicken dinner.

Such a small period of time and such massive results. Anyone going through the early days and first month please look at this and see yourself writing the same.

I looked at a guy with 180 days when I quit and just thought I will NEVER make that. I was overwhelmed at his number and felt the agony of my quit so acutely and my past failures so thoroughly that I had to break things down and listen to the bikeridinman, just take today and dont smoke: easy.

It really is that easy, I know its crazy. Just dont smoke today whatever it takes and tomorrow will worry about itself. At first I had to break it down hour by hour and fight each craving with a verbal mantra: I do not like smoking, I am a non smoker, smoking tastes like shit, smoking will kill me, fuck off smoking. You get the idea. Remeber whatever it takes, DO NOT smoke today and you'll be fine and 2 grand richer in a few sweet months.

Stay strong.

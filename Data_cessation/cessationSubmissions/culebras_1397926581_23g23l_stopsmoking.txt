Having a tough moment at day 49

Just a Week after quitting, things went South on the small company i work at. 
Since then, Psychological harrassment from my Boss, Job interviews at other Companies and important Financial decisions are turning to routine, nagging on my Nerves constantly.

I have remained fully nicotine free, but i feel i can't relate to the feeling of liberation many report after 3-24 days.

I have a feeling that i have been dragging withdrawal symptoms to this day because of work stress; i am still extremely tense, easily irritated, pessimistic and anxious.

I know that if i'd still smoke my problems wouldn't be any different (in fact i'd have one more), but my head keeps trying to circumvent that logic, and it sucks dearly.

God knows why i'm writing this, but whatever keeps me from thinking of relapse is time well spent...

Cessation of Quitter's Hunger - Your Experiences

Well I had some pretty serious hunger cravings during my first month or so but its seemed to have calmed down the past two weeks. There were points were it was just horrible, craving for food far more than a cigarette. I'd eat twice as much and feel half as full. I knew that I couldn't just feed into my hunger because of course I'd put on weight. A slower metabolism plus more food...? Then you start to expand your stomach which then takes more food to feel full. What a nightmare. So for the most part I've just tried to ignore and stick with my typical 2 meals a day that I've pretty much always ate. A bit shittier, craving for cigs AND food, great! NOT. That phase now seems to have passed and I don't find myself starving throughout the day.

Would like to hear everyone's experience with this, especially when you felt like the abnormal hunger went away.

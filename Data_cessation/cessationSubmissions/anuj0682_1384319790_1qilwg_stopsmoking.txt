Some tips for reducing and quitting, if you're in a developing country

Many users that post here are from US, and we get a lot of good perspectives from them when it comes to quitting. However, I am from India and believe that some there can be some additional tips, specially for quitters in other parts of the world. Not everything will apply to quitters from all countries, so feel free to pick and choose.

Also, please pardon my English since it's not my first language. 

Here are some tips which helped me reduce and eventually quit:

1) **Don't buy cigarette packets**. 
If you're anything like the typical smoker in India, you buy cigarettes from places like [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c1/PaanShop.jpg/750px-PaanShop.jpg). That guy also sells you loose cigarettes for 5-10 Rupees (1 dollar =64 rupees roughly). When you visit this shop next time, don't buy a full packet but just one cigarette. Let your laziness trump your craving every time you want to smoke.

2) **Buy cigarettes of smaller length when you are reducing** Most cigarettes come in two lengths - 84mm and 69mm. So instead of buying a [Gold Flake kings](http://fsb.zedge.net/scale.php?img=OC85LzAvMy8xLTczOTcwNDYtODkwMzk0OC5qcGc&ctype=1&v=4&q=81&xs=620&ys=383&sig=31e78abdfed18307cf79eec53e0380e752c3def8), but a [Gold Flake small](http://image3.mouthshut.com/images/imagesp/l/Goldflake-Small-925054036s.jpg). 



3) **Never buy filter-less cigarettes** When you're out somewhere in a rural area and the 'paanwallah' doesn't have cigarettes, don't smoke something which is even more dangerous that your regular cigarettes. [Beedis](http://www.gamo.co.uk/images/bidi1.jpg) are five times more likely to kill you than cigarettes. (I'll link the study if can find it). Smoking cigarettes kills you, and beedis will do it *five* times faster.

4) **Don't smoke at home, in the balcony, on the roof, etc**. 
In India (and it's the same in a lot of other developing countries), you live with your extended family. And one tries to sneak out for a cigarette every once in a while so that you don't smoke in front of them. Guess what, that smell sticks and you will stink. Everyone knows. Sit back home and divert your mind to something else rather than the cigarette.

3) **When quitting smoking, don't start other nicotine heavy stuff like [beedi](http://www.gamo.co.uk/images/bidi1.jpg), [gutkha](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/multimedia/dynamic/01093/panmasala_1093959f.jpg), [khaini](http://chainikhaini.com/images/pack.gif)** Smokeless tobacco products are very popular and you see a lot of people chewing them all the time. Don't replace lung cancer with tongue / mouth cancer, they are very dangerous and as addictive as smoking!

5) **Use nicotine gums!** Nicotine gums were unheard of 2-3 years back, but have finally started appearing in the market - you can get it from your chemist or even some good paan shops. One pack of 10 gums costs exactly the same as one pack of 10 cigarettes. At around 65 rupess (1$), you can finally try it. It will help you reduce your cigarette consumption daily. 

Of course, most of these tips are for reducing and not really quitting smoking - and I recommend quitting cold turkey if you have the will power!

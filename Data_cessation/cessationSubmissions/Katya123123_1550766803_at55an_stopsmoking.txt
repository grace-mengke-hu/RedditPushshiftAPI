6 months today

I had completely forgotten dates until smoke free popped up. 

I used to post here a lot about quitting, how hard it is, the weight, the lows etc... and have to say, you forget. 

It gets easier, if you gain weight you lose it, you get more consistent and stop being moody. You forget you smoked 99.9% of the time. 

Thanks to everyone here who supported me in my first weeks. Hereâ€™s to the rest of my smoke free life!

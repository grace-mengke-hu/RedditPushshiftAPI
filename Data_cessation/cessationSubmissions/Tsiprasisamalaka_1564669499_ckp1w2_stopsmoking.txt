Literal mental breakdown

I quit last night at midnight and it’s 5:21 in the late afternoon and I just had a horrible mental breakdown in front of my husband. He just left the house in absolute shock with some comments about getting me locked up and I need a doctor and I shouldn’t be around our 1.5 year old. 

I literally don’t even know how to explain it. I just broke down and cried like a psycho for a little under 2 hours. Like on the floor throbbing and convulsing kind of crying. I just feel hopeless and it’s the end of the world. Just because I can’t smoke a cigarette. Our economic situation is really the reason I’m quitting but I think I’d rather starve than feel this awful. 

Please tell me it gets better. Am I the only one to react like this? Could I have like an underlying mental illness or something if this is strange behavior?

My mind is racing!

I quit cold turkey this sunday. But my mind is racing, and I catch myself making up stupid excuses right now, as to light up a cigarette once again.


*I've quit before, and made it almost a year before caving. In total I've been smoking for 13 years I would say.*


*Nicotine is a damn bitch!**

Day one and anxious

It’s day one for me. Well technically 8 hours in. I keep thinking about the last time I quit and the amount of panic attack’s it gave me. This time my plan is to use yoga to relax myself when I’m going down mentally. But I’m still worried about the anxiety and sadness creeping in. I know it’s a side effect of quitting. What did you all do to help with that?

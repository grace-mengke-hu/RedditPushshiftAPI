Smoking dreams

So I’ve had the smoking dreams since around day 3, but the one I had last night was just crazy. I was thirsty and standing in a gas station looking at shelves of soda trying to pick one out to drink but the cans of soda would suddenly change into pack of cigarettes. I kept getting angry because I didn’t want the smokes, I wanted the soda and no one else could understand my anger.  Think I stood for about a total of 10-dream-minutes just staring and glaring at these packs of cigs I did not want and was not able to make them turn back into soda.  

Woke up in a sour fit after that too lol.

What’s your craziest ex-smokers dream you’ve had?

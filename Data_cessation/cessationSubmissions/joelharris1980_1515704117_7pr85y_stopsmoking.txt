How aggressive is too aggressive when encouraging someone to quit?

We’ve been trying to get my MIL to quit smoking for years.   My wife has been trying since she was a kid.  We’ve asked. We’ve explained how much we love her and want her to be there to see her grandkids.  I’ve shown the financial costs.   I’ve explained how nasty the house smells.   No response.   Says the she doesn’t believe that smoking gives people cancer.   

Wife just cries and feels helpless.   I want to go nuclear.   Perhaps full color photos of lungs.   Perhaps getting an electronic voice box and only taking to her through it.   Am I crossing the line?

My friend died

I just woke up to news that my friend died over the weekend in an accident. 

He was seated behind the driver on a bus and the bus hit another vehicle. My friend and the driver died.

I am sad and hurt and confused and I want to cry.  

When I first learned the news my brain immediately went to wanting a cigarette. 

But not today. I will not smoke a cigarette.

Take time to let those you care about know you love them. Smile and dance and hug and tell them out loud you love them.

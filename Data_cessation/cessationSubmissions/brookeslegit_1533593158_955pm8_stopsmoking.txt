Day 8 no vape and just finished a run *deep breath* ahhhhh....

Had pretty bad shin splints the last few weeks from the ground drying out so much and only today were they good enough to do a cheeky 5k. Stopped/ish smoking cigarettes about three months ago and I've been chain vaping non stop since (18mg), until 8 days ago when I went cold turkey.

Take it from me even after 8 days without a toke of either analogue or digital even running in this 28C/82F humid London evening my lungs felt doubled in capacity! I had my suspicions vaping wasn't nearly as healthy as it's often touted to be and today is personal proof of that, no wheezing or nausea making me gag in front of the dog walkers at the top of the steep hill on my route. 

Granted I didn't smell, didn't have to invent crazy excuses for nipping out for ten minutes or pay nearly as much for my weekly stock but the realisation was because of these benefits when it dawned on me 'I've given up all the annoyances of smoking, yet I've still got to secretly nip to the toilet to get my fix, have I really quashed the problem or is this proof of the fact I'm merely a different type of drug addict hiding in these bathroom stalls?'

So yes if this is just the start of my lungs clearing up then count me in for the long run, I feel fantastic and after just 4 days I was largely able to forget about it most of the day and get drunk last night without cracking with my former smoking area buddies. 

I've quit cold turkey successfully twice before, once for six months and once for nine. Both times at five months I remember never needing a cig again, yet both times it was beautiful beaches in the tropics that made me reach for the associated final cherry on the cake...

...Guess I'll just not go on holiday ever again üòÅ

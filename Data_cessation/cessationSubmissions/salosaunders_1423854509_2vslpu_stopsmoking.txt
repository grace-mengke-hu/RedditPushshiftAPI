TWO WEEKS!

Yesssss! I am so proud of myself. I quit drinking and smoking on the same day and my world has been turned upside down in the best way possible. My skin is glowing, I'm losing weight, I smell good, I don't cough, and I don't wake up with that raw feeling in the back of my throat. Most of all, I don't live with the cognitive dissonance that comes with smoking. I am not smoking today! Thank you thank you thank you to this sub.

What if I don't have a reason to quit?

I downloaded a quit-smoking app on my phone and it asked me to list my reasons for quitting. I realized, then, that I don't really have any. I don't have a girlfriend or wife demanding that I quit, I don't have any problem affording cigarettes, and most importantly, nobody really cares whether I smoke or don't. I'm 22 and, if I'm to be totally honest, I don't really care about the health effects. I know that sounds obnoxious, but I can't be the only one who feels that way.

I have been trying to quit smoking since last month because I had to take a trip with people who hate smokers. But now that I'm back, I just don't see a reason to quit smoking. I enjoyed smoking a lot, it was a nice little ritual I had. And I know that, even if I stay quit for weeks, one drunken night a few months from now will just wreck everything.

Has anyone ever felt this way? Everyone keeps telling me to be disciplined but I have to wonder: why? What's the point of torturing myself to stop doing something I genuinely enjoyed?

42 days and a puff...

Tonight I went out. It's 5am and just got home.
I had dinner with my boyfriend and some friends. Then we went for drinks and I was ok without smoking. At 2:30 my boyfriend was tired and decided to go home. I was a bit drunk already and decided to stay with some friends. My boyfriend doesn't smoke, and that has helped me to quite and stay smoke free.
I went to a night club with friends, and one of them was smoking. As I was drunk (still a bit while I write this) I asked him to take a puff. I felt wrong doing it. But that was not all: Also the taste was like ash tray and horrible. I don't think I had notion before how horrible was the taste of a cigarette. 
If in one hand I fell bad for having a puff, now I'm glad I did it and didn't enjoy it. I don't know how was I able to smoke a pack a day for 14 years... 
Was the best decision I did in 2015. Hope to be able to kip it up in 2016. Keep strong as well, you guys!

Well here I am. Round 2.

I was quit for 150 days when I had a drunken cigarette. Which turned into 3 drunken cigarettes. Which turned into a sober pack. Which turned into full blown smoking.

Been about 2 months back on and I haven't enjoyed any of them. I put them all out half way through disgusted. I'm done for good. I have smoked my last cigarette.

For all you who have quit don't fall for the trap. I thought I was special but they hooked me again like they do everyone else.

Stay strong everyone. Here's to a long happy life.

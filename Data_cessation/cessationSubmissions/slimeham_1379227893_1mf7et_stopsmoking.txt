gastrointestinal issues

I can't really say when this all started because I didn't attribute it to quitting smoking at first and over the last couple of weeks is gotten worse. I've got this almost constant discomfort in my stomach and intestines. I wouldn't say that it's painful but only uncomfortable. It seems to be mostly gas because... well... I'm farting all the time and there's a lot of growling going on down there whether I'm hungry or not.

Has anyone else experienced these symptoms this far into their quit? I Googled around and found people in other online forums who've said they experienced this anywhere from within just the first few days to 10 months of their quit but I'd like to know some of your experiences with this. I'm currently uninsured so seeing a doctor isn't an option unless I'm in dire pain which I'm not. 

EDIT: Not sure if this is relevant or not but I also quit smoking weed 2 weeks after I quit cigarettes.

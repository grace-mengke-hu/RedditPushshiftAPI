Sleep is messed up

Decided to quit 24 hours ago. I had slept all day in a bit of depression  from some issues. So I woke up at 11pm last night and decided to just power through. Had Chinese food went to bed at 8pm today and woke up feeling like I slept a nice 20 hours. Except I slept 4 hours. I can handle the cravings still taking them 3 minutes at a time. Got my water bottle. I'm a pack every 2 day smoker for 16 years. I have never felt this definite while going cold turkey before. 

Now I'm wide awake though and I got shit to do tomorrow. I can't sleep and 4 hours in 2 nights is a little nerve racking. 

My triggers are cars, meals stress,  and now my wife's sleepy nic breath beside me as she majestically sleeps. She smokes inside it's an argument I can't win yet but we are painting soon so maybe after she scrubs walls with me. She is not ready to quit. I respect that.  

I was thinking getting up and going to the grocery store for some bag salad and wine gums.  Any sleep advice while I'm still winning and feeling capable?

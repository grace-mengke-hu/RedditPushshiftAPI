It's already been 100 days?!

The first two months dragged and dragged, but now it feels like I'm on cruise control. I get mild cravings from time to time, but they're nothing more than passing thoughts that I swat away like a fly.

My favorite thing about the quit is not starting my day with that horrible, achey craving when I wake up. My skin is clearer, I'm better rested, and I've had zero anxiety issues. I do have a bit of a dry cough which has popped up in the last month or so, but that seems to be subsiding, and I attribute it to still smoking some grass.

Thanks for the support everyone. For those at the very beginning of their journey, keep up the good fight. Life without smokes is the worth it. So worth it. For those well into their journey, I have no advice. You already know how great life can be.

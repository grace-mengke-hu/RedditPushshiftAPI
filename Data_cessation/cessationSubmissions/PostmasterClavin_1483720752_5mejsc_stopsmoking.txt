To people who have quit smoking: how long of not smoking did it take to gain the confidence to know you won the battle?

A question for people who have quit smoking for good.  How long did it take from your last cigarette to the point where you felt like you were over the hump and won the battle?  I know everyone says it gets easier over time but what kind of time are we talking about?  I'm within week 1 of this battle and was hoping to find some insight on how long this withdrawal lasts.  I understand you can't over come withdrawal without suffering but If anyone has an estimation on how long that suffering last, I'd greatly appreciate it.

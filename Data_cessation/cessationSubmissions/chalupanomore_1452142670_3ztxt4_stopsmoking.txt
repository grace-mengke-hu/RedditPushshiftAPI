Sorry I'm posting a lot today, but I made it through and I wanted to share.

Hey everyone! I posted earlier about my #basicbitch problems I was having that were causing me to feel a little shaky. However, the day got somewhat worse. 

I've been trying to find a new job since I have some weird issues with my current job. I received a call back today for a position. However, I started to get super anxious about it. I thought about having to quit my current job, will they be upset with me since I took the Christmas bonus they gave me, I haven't been there very long, my boss is super weird and possessive over me, will I hate this new job, just like completely worked myself up. Then my SO called me out on my anxiety and made me feel super fucking weird about it. I went to my friends house shortly after this happened so our dogs could play and we could watch American idol and all j wanted to do was smoke. 


I went outside and sat at their table I like to smoke and have a drink at and I just felt like all the pressure of the day could be cured with one fucking cigarette. It would be so easy. I could feel better. I really don't know what held me back from smoking, because I wanted to  do so so so so badly, but I didn't. I held strong. Here I am going into day 12! Almost two full weeks! If I can do it so can you!

Switched to vaping 6 months ago

And now, I'm really considering quitting that too. The vape I bought leaks now, and it's just a headache thinking about trying to replace it. But I'm scared, and I doubt my resolve. Did I mention I'm scared? It's been so many years using nicotine as a crutch, I just don't know if I can do this. :(

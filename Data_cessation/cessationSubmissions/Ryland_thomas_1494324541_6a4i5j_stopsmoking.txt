The struggles real

Im just curious if anybody else has had the same issue (I'm sure there are plenty) I'm about 3months completely smoke free, however my cravings are only getting stronger, not an hour goes by that i don't think about lighting one up and everyday its getting harder and harder to push the urge back into its box. I was always under the assumption that by this point they should be getting less frequent. 

Anybody have any advice they could share itd be much appreciated.

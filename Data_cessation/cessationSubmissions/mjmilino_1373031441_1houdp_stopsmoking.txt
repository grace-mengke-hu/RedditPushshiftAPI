Three days in, you people are the best!

Hey all. I said hello to everyone on Tuesday and you guys were incredibly supportive, so here's an update:

Hi everyone, my name's Mike...and I'm still a non-smoker. It's been three days now, so the nicotine is basically out of my system. It's been a hell of a lot easier than I thought, so Mr. Carr was correct. Over the past few days I:

-had a bit of a tense day with my ex-wife, didn't smoke

-had a bunch of drinks on Wednesday night while hosting trivia, didn't smoke

-had a bunch of drinks yesterday while having a cookout and hanging out with all of my friends (many of whom smoke), didn't smoke

I'm as happy as can be to be a non-smoker still. Anyone reading this who's still thinking about stopping smoking, you can do it! Thanks everyone!

Day 5 but things change tomorrow

Hey everyone this is my first post, here's the situation -
I live with 7 people in my student halls who all smoke 
I've smoked for over a year now
I've been at my girlfriends house since Wednesday and haven't smoked, it's actually been really easy because when I'm with her I forget all about smoking. So I've used the opportunity of being here as a kick-start to my quitting.
BUT I go back to halls tomorrow and I'm going to be around everyone smoking again ... 
Just wanted some support or any suggestions, I suppose writing it down here just helps to get it off my chest

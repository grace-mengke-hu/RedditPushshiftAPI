18 y/o smoker. Tried to quit countless times in the last 5 months. Any advice?

Hi all.  Any help at all would be really useful. 

I've tried to quit many many times recently and all times have failed. So I was wondering if you guys had any advice from experience? I would be really grateful. 

I'm a very anxious person and I've come to believe I smoke to control that anxiety. I don't even really enjoy the feeling. It makes my throat tight and can sometimes even make me nauseous. When I smoke I don't even think about it, I zone out and don't even experience the cigarette until it's finished. Which is why I can't understand why I haven't been able to quit! 

Right now, I'm smoking 20+ a day, and I've literally only just turned 18. Awful. I know. I hate myself for it. Even worse is that when I try to quit. I can't even go a single day. I always end up smoking on impulse. It really gets me down, which in turn makes me smoke even more. 

I've tried NRT and cold turkey, none seem to work. They don't calm my anxiety like a cigarette does. 

It's almost as if I force myself to smoke more, Subconsciously. If I was just solely going on my need for nicotine I would guess that I would be on less than 10 a day. This may sound really strange but I can't really explain it much better than that. 

I know this is an odd one, but maybe one of you used to be the same and has some insight. 

Thanks guys :) and good luck to any quitters reading!

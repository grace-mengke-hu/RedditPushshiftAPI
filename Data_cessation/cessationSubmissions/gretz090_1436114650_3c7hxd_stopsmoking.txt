Going on vacation with smokers- tips?

So I guess I poorly planned quitting lol but I'm now 9 days with out one and am going on a vacation to with a group next week. Of the 10 people going 8 are smokers. We're going to Nashville and as far as I can tell you can still smoke in bars there. Any tips on how I should go about this situation? Thanks in advance, this community has made it easier for me.

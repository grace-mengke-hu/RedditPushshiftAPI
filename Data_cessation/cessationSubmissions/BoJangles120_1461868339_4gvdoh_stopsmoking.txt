Last Pack

I currently have a pack with 13 cigs in it. These WILL BE my last cigarettes. Once this pack is done, I am done. Fuckin things cause more stress than they help relieve. I am done having my lungs feel like an ashtray. I am done waking up in the middle of the night weezing. I am done noticeably feeling my circulation be shit every time I partake in physical activity. I am done having a half assed palette. I AM DONE.

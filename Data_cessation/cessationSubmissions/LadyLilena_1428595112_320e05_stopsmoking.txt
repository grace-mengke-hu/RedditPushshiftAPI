19 days and I don't even *want* one anymore!

For my first two weeks of quitting, I completed isolated myself from anyone who smokes or any areas where smoking is dominant.  After the initial first week, I thought about it less and less. 

This past weekend I was extremely nervous as half my family chain smokes in their house including my grandparents/uncle/aunts, etc. and I couldn't bail on them for Easter Dinner.

I was around it for the majority of the day and I'm happy to say I stayed strong!! 

I have to admit some thoughts crossed my mind such as "just one little puff..." or "maybe just one little hit..." but I *knew* it was doing more damage than good and I'm stronger than that to backtrack all the progress I've made.

I proudly announced that I quit and everyone was very supportive about it, although it saddened me that they were still slaves to the habit. 

I never thought that after 10 years at a pack a day that I would come to a point today where I don't even want it anymore. :)

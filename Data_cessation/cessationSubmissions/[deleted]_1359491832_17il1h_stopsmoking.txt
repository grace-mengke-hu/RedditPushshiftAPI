Something is seriously wrong...

25 a day habit for 6 years. Day 14, I'm having extremely drops of depression and anger.. something is seriously wrong. I feel like striking my mom. I can't stop thinking severe suicidal thoughts... I feel sick on and off and just want to sleep so I don't have to be in reality. I'm not really craving much. These feelings actually have nothing to do with cravings... I can't afford help I'm on my last days. I either smoke or I don't think these feelings ... ugh I don't know. I can't handle this. Its not getting better. Its getting worse. Don't feed me bullshit. What the fuck do I do?

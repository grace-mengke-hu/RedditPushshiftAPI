Do/did you have any withdrawal symptoms while quitting?

So I want to quit so badly but Iâ€™m terrified of withdrawal symptoms. I tried a couple of times and the first time everything was fine. The second time my head wanted to explode, the third it was the headache + I was incredibly tired all the time, and the fourth time it was the the headache + tiredness + terrible constipation.  If you had any withdrawal symptoms what was it and how did you deal with it?

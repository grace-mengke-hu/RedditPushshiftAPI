Here I go again!!!! Peace🙏🏻

I will keep trying until I succeed.  I go all day until night, sometimes up to 12 or 14 hours and then I light up. Maybe I’m wired but after that long without a cigarette I get dizzy when I smoke and I like it.  
Today instead of making a promise to quit I am going to make a decision to quit and stick with it!
As always advice, tips and support are very welcomed. Peace 😎

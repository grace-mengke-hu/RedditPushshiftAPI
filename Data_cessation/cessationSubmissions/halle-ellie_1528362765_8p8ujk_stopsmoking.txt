Freedom at fifteen!

Hi all, happy to be here! Smoked 15 roll ups a day for 15+ years and now I’m on day 15 smoke free! Feeling strong and much more positive this week.
I feel like my anxiety and stress has reduced which is the most unexpected and most amazing benefit from quitting. It’s like I’ve been given freedom from the nervous, highly strung stress-head I was before.
I know it’s early days for me but so excited to see what else this new chapter brings : )

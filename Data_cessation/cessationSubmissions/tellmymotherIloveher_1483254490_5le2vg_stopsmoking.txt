2 years Nicotine-free today: if I can, you can.

It's possible and it's worth it. I promise. I've saved over Â£5000 and now run over 50km a week. The first couple weeks are hard (share about it here and take strength and hope from others) but it is so worth it. Believe me it is. Luck doesn't come in to it- just know that YOU CAN DO THIS!!

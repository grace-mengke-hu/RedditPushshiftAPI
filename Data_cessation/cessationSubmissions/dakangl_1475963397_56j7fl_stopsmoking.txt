I'm gonna stick to it this time.

I've smoked since I was 13. I've quit plenty of times.  Always said I could quit when ever I wanted to and for the most part I could. But I always started again. 

3 years ago I got pregnant. I was smoking almost a pack a day at that point. Cut way down during the pregnancy and quit 2 hours before I delivered a healthy baby boy. 

3 days in hospital without a single craving. Came home. Didn't smoke for over a year. 

Last November I bought a pack because I was stressed and was only gonna smoke that pack. And the next. And the next. 

At first I didn't smoke around my son. I didn't want him seeing it. That didn't last long

My 2 year old has grabbed a pack and put one in his mouth and grabbed the lighter before I noticed. 

He can't say ice cream but can say "cigarette" he knows it means we are going down stairs. 

I need to quit for him. But I don't want to say it to anyone because no one will believe me. 

1 hour and counting. I can do this.

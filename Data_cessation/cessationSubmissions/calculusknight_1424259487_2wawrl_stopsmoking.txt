One day and counting... Here's what made me quit

There were lots of reasons, but one definitely stands out. I'm 29 years old, and while I don't have any kids of my own, I'm an uncle of 7. And these kids are what motivates me.

My 10-year-old niece and goddaughter came up to me one day while I was smoking. She asked me "When are you going to quit?"

I didn't have an answer, hadn't even really thought about it. So I said "I don't know."

Her reply to that was: "Please quit soon. I don't want you to die young."

Well, here I am. One day in and motivated.

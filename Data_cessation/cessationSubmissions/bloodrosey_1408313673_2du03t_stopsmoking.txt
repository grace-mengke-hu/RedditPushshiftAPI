Day 2 of quitting, Day 10 of Postpartum Depression - How do I cope?

I restarted smoking three days after my baby was born since the postpartum was driving me crazy. 

The new baby motivated my husband to quit.  I told him I would join him, thinking we were going to quit in 2 weeks.  He then said the whyquit website said that unplanned quitting is more successful than planned, and he was done that night.  I knew my resolve would only work if I quit with him.  If I waited 2 weeks, I'd find a reason to not quit.

Well now I'm dealing with postpartum depression (not just baby blues - there are multiple times a day that I have to be watched for suicide) while not having my crutch. Has anyone had experience with something this difficult while quitting? Any advice? I could really use some advice.

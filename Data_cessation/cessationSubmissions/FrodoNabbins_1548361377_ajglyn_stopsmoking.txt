Been trying to quit for 3 years. After failing multiple times i feel like this is the moment!

Hello! So I've smoked for almost 15 years and have tried , like many others to quit many, many times. Every time I would get close to staying smoke free I would get these horrible headaches and this choking feeling in my throat... Like there was a giant golf ball lodged in there. I later figured out that this was anxiety.

The fear of not having something like cigarettes to cope with my anxiety scared the hell out of me, and that's why no matter how hard I tried I couldn't quit. Then , about a year ago something amazing happened. What started out as a psychotic break that lasted for months on end turned out to be the biggest blessing I ever received.

My mental illnesses vanished. I have been on MANY meds my entire life... And all of a sudden, I stopped experiencing the symptoms of my depression, anxiety, and other more personal issues. It's been like this for a few months now, and I have felt like I'm living a new life!

Then, 3 days ago... As I was running out of cigarettes something else clicked... If I am not experiencing issues like depression and anxiety/ panic attacks... Then what's stopping me from quitting cigarettes for good? I already quit drinking about a year ago after battling that for many years... What's stopping me now??

So as I smoked my last butt from my ashtray last night I started the journey to quit for good. I'm really trying hard to not psych myself out, knowing that I have a tendency to quit my goals once I see that I have a chance at succeeding. I never want to smoke ever EVER again!

What can I do to make sure this is the last time? What have you all done? How is your journey going?

I look forward to chatting with you all :)

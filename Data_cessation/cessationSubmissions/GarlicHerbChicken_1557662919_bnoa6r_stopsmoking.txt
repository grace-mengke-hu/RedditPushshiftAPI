Specific problem

Friday night I got really drunk. So drunk I dont remember almost nothing from the night. Is there any way to know if I smoked or not? I dont have any cravings I am now 3 weeks smoke free but I am not sure if I smoked or not. I asked people they said they didnâ€™t see me smoking. On the other hand I was in smoking area but I went there to talk not to smoke I think. I would know if I smoked in the morning right? Probably I would be craving also. Share your thoughts if anybody has some insight. I really cannot find a way to find out. I do not have any desire to smoke ever again but I need to know.

A lucky coincidence.

This is my best opportunity to quit, the last summer I will be at home with my parents before I finish uni (they don't know so I can't smoke). After that there will be nothing forcing me not to smoke except myself - much harder!
The day I quit I came down with some horrific man flu which I'm just recovering from now. It really helped the first week because I felt so bad anyway! See how it goes from here.
Moral of the story: If you're planning to quit - try and get ill first, it takes your mind off it!

quitting smoking with anger management issues.

So I decided to quit smoking again. The last time I did I became the biggest asshole ever and just stayed clear of anyone and everything for 2 weeks. I also had to quit smoking weed and drinking temporarily so that my fortitude wasn't weakened. This will make me even more of an asshole, I think since I haven't drank it a few weeks I should be okay on that front but not smoking weed will be an adjustment.


Now here is the problem. I have two jobs that I really love. I love the people I work with, i love the hours, and the pay. Both are fairly stressful at times though. The roofing job everyone smokes cigs and we carpool to jobsites so I will be stuck in a van for an hour some days with people smoking all around me. Plus we mess with eachother and tease. The other job is at a pizza place where I deliver, not as bad but I work with some people who can be rather incompetent and one of my mangers kind get kind of annoyingly micromanaging.


I can't really miss any work at either of these jobs but I don't want to lash out and lose either of them. I don't know what kind of release would work best. Last time I ate whenever I craved a cig and ended up gaining a lot of weight over the course of months.


I think I am going to write a note and hang it up on the board at the pizza place explaining that I am quitting and that if I lash out or become an asshole it's nothing personal and I'm truly sorry. Something along the lines of give me five minutes (how long my typical nic fits last) I will come to my senses and feel very bad. I also want to like bring treats in every day as a preemptive Sorry.


I just need some advice, Nobody in my family knows I started smoking again and so unlike last time I don't have them cheering me on.

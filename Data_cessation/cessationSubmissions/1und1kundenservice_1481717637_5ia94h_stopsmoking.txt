m/16 quitting while I still can

Started half a year ago, I smoke mostly on weekends, especially in combination with alcohol and sometimes in school breaks. Probs 2-3 packs a month. Decided I need to stop while I can still do it without the nicotine withdrawal killing me. had my last cigarette yesterday afternoon. Any tips/suggestions would be appreciated.

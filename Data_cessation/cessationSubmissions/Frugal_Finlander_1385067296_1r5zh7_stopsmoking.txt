3 weeks in, been a bad day today... problem resolved [EXPLAINED]

3 weeks in, cravings had all but disappeared, and then this morning walking over campus and it hit hard, for hours. Class was shit, left early just to sit in agony on the subway, that was shit.  How did I get free of this craving?... Took a shit.

Alright i won't let the post end there. Nicotine is an enteric nervous system stimulator, after prolonged use, all forms of nicotine will enhance gastrointestinal movement and make pooping all that easier. We all know this, what I didn't realise, was leaving the house that morning, having not taken a shit, meant I was outside of my routine, and I spent some of the day holding it in as I had no pressing need to relieve myself, or rather I had no nicotine telling me to do so. It wasn't a battle to hold in this shit, i have no fear of public washrooms, and i relieved myself eventually. It's just that smoking would've made it a more present desire to take the dump that I should've taken that morning. That said, amidst the horrific craving, I'm still going strong. I'm at about 3 weeks, and I've made a conscious decision to forget my quit date. So even though I could try to do the calculations to remember when, I'm gonna leave it outside of my awareness. My real clean date is august 27th, and that's free of alcohol and drugs, so on a completely unrelated note, that's the day I consider the most important quit.


**Tl;Dr**: quit smoking, but make sure you take a dump when your body tells you to.

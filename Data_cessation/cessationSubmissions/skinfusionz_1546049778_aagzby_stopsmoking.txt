Did not even realize it....

I've crossed seven years free from this horrible addiction.  Honestly folks, I have a horribly addictive personality.  If I can do this, you can do this. 

This community helped me so much in year one and I will always be thankful and grateful for the posts and pms I received during that time.

If you are just joining this community, know that I know you can quit forever if you want it.

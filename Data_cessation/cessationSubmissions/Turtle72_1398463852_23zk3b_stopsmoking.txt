Trouble with dealing with down time at work and home. HOw to deal with it? HOw do you all deal with down time?

In my job there is a ton of downtime as I work on the computer and it drives me absolutely bonkers - the downtime that is.  It's extremely quiet in the office all day long (even though there are plenty of people in the area) and all you can hear are the whirring  of the air conditioners most of the time.  It's quite eerie.  I used to go out for a smoke every hour just to get away from the eerieness of it all.  I thought I needed to do this to quell the anxiety that the environment caused me, but after 4 weeks with no smokes I realize that I don't need to to smoke to deal with it.  I may just need to get a new job.  

I need to be busier though.  Too much downtime is brutal to me.  Anybody else have this issue?

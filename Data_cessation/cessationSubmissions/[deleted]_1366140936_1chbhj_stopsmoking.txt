Starting today!!

Today is the day. I had my (hopefully) last cigarette last night. I've tried quitting before and my longest record was one month. However, the problem is after a while when I haven't smoked for a while, I tend to forget all the things that motivated me to quit smoking in the first place. Do you have any advice as to how to remember the motivations all the time and never letting your guards down? Thanks.

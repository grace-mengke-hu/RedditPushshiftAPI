24 Hours!

I've been a smoker for 3 years, and so far I have made countless attempts to quit. What got me going this time was the fact that I feel like I'm breathing through a straw (I have a sore throat). As a smoker, I've used the cigarette as an excuse to pull me through hard times, and as a reward for hard work. I've made and lost friends through the cigarette. But I don't want to be dependent on cigarettes anymore. I'll need a lot of self-convincing to do. I hope you can bear with me /r/stopsmoking, I'll keep you posted as the time goes by.

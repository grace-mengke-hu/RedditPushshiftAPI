After 17 years, it's time!

After 17 years of smoking, tonight is the night I finally quit cigarettes for good.

I have 40ml of juice and a tank to start to get me off nicotine also, it's the start of a long and fruitful journey.

The messages on this sub fill me with hope and determination, I want to live to see my 2 beautiful children grow up to be adults and live a meaningful life without smoke with them.

Wish me luck please!

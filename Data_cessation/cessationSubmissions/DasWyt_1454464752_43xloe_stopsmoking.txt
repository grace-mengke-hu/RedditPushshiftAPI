Sore Throat

So it's been about 3 or 4 weeks now and I've had a sore throat for about a week now. When I first stopped it came on with lots of gross mucous and runny nose, but that ended about a week after. Now it's back but it's just slightly sore and hurts pretty bad to swallow. Is this quitters flu coming back again or what? Thanks

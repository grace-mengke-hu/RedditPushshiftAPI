Smoked my last one yesterday afternoon, today is day 1.

The cravings are pretty bad at the moment, even with the e-cigarette (which I hope is going to get me to actually stick with it this time). I'm tired of smoking, tired of thinking "this is disgusting" while doing it, but at the same time, I *really* want a cigarette right now.

Any moral support you guys have lying around is appreciated. Thanks.

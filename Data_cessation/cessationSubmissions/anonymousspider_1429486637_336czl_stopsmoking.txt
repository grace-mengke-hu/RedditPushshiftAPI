Supporting a friend

Hi guys, 

I have a friend who stopped smoking last Monday. Yesterday we were in a group setting where other (non-smoker) "friends" were purposefully pissing him off because they knew he'd already been agitated. This really annoyed me and I wanted to punch them in their stupid fucking faces; I imagine he was feeling the same way. 

As a bit of a background, he was my partner's best friend. We lost my partner at the start of the year due to a cerebral haemorrhage (smoking was probably a primary indirect factor causing the haemorrhage but there's no conclusive proof). My partner had been trying to quit for 2 years and never quite got there so I'd really like to help and support our friend as much as possible. 

I see him about once a week in a group setting. What can I do to support him without being overbearing?

TIA

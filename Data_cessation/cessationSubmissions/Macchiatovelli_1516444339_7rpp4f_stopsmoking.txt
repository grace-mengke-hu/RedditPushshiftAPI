Just put out my last cigarette...

I figured just writing that and putting it out in the world would make it seem more, I dunno, more...real? I seem to get a few days under my belt then cave come the end of my Friday night shift (I bartend which is a haven for smokers). This time I'm going for the long haul. 

Share your quitting stories. I want to know the mindset of a succesful quitter!

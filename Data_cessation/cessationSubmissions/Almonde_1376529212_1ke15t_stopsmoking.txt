Day one again!

Over the past couple of months I've tried a few times to stop smoking. My boyfriend pointed me here, and I finally yesterday I felt like I was getting bored of this bad habit. I smoke about 3-5 a day usually, and have a flatmate who smokes on and off also. 

Nevertheless, it's starting to stress me out that I haven't successfully quit yet, so I'm hoping with some tips, support and a lot of willpower I can finally do it this time!

Need advice on quitting

Like many I've tried to quit smoking so many times in the past to end up in total failure.

Lately I've been having weird dreams and the thought that I'm going to die and my baby who is only 2 will be without a father. This has scared the crap out of me.

I started smoking later than most at 21 yrs old. I'm now 38. Ive cut down to about half a pack a day but I can't seem to go lower than that. Now my wife's family just sent me 2 cartons of cigs from overseas where they are so much cheaper. I want to try and quit again but that temptation of free cigs is looming over my head to smoke them. 

What is best, a taper down approach or cold turkey? I want to succeed this time, my baby is my motivation, I want to quit for her. Should I just throw those cartons away?

One Week and One Day

I haven't had a cigarette. I want one, I really want one. I was doing so great, even though it was hard the first couple of days and now my mind is trying to talk me out of it. I don't think I would allow myself to start back because I would be so disappointed. I did get a vape this past weekend and the liquid has zero nicotine. Is this ok? I also feel bored. Smoking gave me something to do ( I have no kids) and now I'm just over here twiddling my thumbs. So I guess my point is, this still sucks.

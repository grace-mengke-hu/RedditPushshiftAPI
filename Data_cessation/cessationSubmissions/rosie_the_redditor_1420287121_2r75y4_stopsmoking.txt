Today marks two weeks without a cigarette.

I've smoked at least one cigarette a day - usually between ten and twenty - just about every day for the last twelve years, missing the odd day here or there due to long-haul flights or being too hungover to want to. 

I like smoking, and I'm going to miss it. I would not have made any friends in college if I didn't smoke, and I wouldn't have made it through my last job without a serious mental break if I hadn't been able to step out for a cigarette after taxing interactions. 

Here's my field report from day 14: My mouth doesn't feel like I've been sucking a cat's asshole all night long when I wake up, I'm not wheezing when walking up stairs, I can smell ***everything,*** and with the extra money, I got a gym membership so I can get my ass back in gear. 

Cheers, and good luck in 2015, everyone!

Tips on cleaning house after quitting?

I recently made the decision that today will be my last day of smoking.  I have read Allen Carr's Easy Way and am feeling really confident and excited!  But I am worried about totally ridding myself, my clothes, and my apartment of the cigarette smell.  Yes, I do smoke in my home, I know I'm a jerk.  Do any of you have tips or experience on this issue, like what products/methods are most effective?  Cost is an issue.  Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!

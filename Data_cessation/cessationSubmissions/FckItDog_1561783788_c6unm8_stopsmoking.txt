Am I addicted?

Hello there.
Sorry if this doesn't fit the group.
Im 19.
I started smoking hookah sometimes with my friends at 17, started cigarretes at 18.
It used to be like, once a month, when we would hang, also hash/weed.
Started getting more frequent.
For a while it became daily, but now its only hangouts again (they all smoke daily).
I get some hard headaches that only go away when I smoke now.
Is that a withdrawl symptom? And does it go away?

Things that are helping me Quit

So I'm fairly new to this. Was a smoker for 15 years. I haven't had one in three weeks. Things that are helping me are: yoga, running/walking, chewing gum, not going outside with my husband when he smokes, I've steered clear of friends that smoke for now, taking deep breaths when I do crave one, and using nicotine patches (though they annoy me).

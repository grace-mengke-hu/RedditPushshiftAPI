Great Odin's Beard! It's been a week!

Technically finished my last pack about 2 & 1/2 weeks ago but had been ashtray surfing since then. I was doing the math today and realized it has been officially 1 whole week since I've had a puff. This is the longest I've ever gone in 14 years.

Things learned: 
-The gum definitely helps.
-You only have to control yourself during moments of cravings. That's only about 6-10 moments a day where I've had to focus and really tell myself 'no'. The rest of the day I haven't even thought about it. 
-It's worth it; better breathing, confidence, not as self-conscious about my smell.
-I also feel a lot more focused and stronger, if that's possible.
-The secret is not giving up. It's like a skill. Practice makes perfect. If at first you don't succeed, try again.

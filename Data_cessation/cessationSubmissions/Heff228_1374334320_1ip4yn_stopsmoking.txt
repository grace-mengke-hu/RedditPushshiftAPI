Anyone ever chew too much Nicorette?

I bought some Nicorette a long time ago, maybe a few months, but randomly started chewing it last week.  It had been so long I forgot the directions and I believe I chewed to much, as in too many pieces to quickly, and too much chewing.  Also, I would fall back to cigs later in the day.

That was about a week ago and I started feeling an increased heartbeat.  Later I had slight trouble breathing and I figured I had a lung infection of sorts.  I went to the doctor and got an inhaler and steroids for a week.  It wasn't until that night that I figured out I was misusing the gum and it could be the source of my problems.

I'm planning on going back to the doctor Monday, but has anyone else ever done this?  Its' just been five days and I'm not sure my heart rate is decreasing anytime soon, it's been as high as 140 and I can feel he throbbing in my throat and it bothers me when I lay down.  I just couldn't imagine the excess nicotine would stay in you body this long, and I have majorly cut back on smoking.

Any help would be appreciated, most of this could be anxiety, although I never really experienced that either.

Yesterday was rough...

I have been on the search for a new job for the past couple of months. I had an amazing interview a couple weeks ago for a really great job. No doubt in my mind I was going to get it.  I had a connection with everyone in the office and my qualifications were a perfect match. I even had two inside references at the company. I found out yesterday that they went with another candidate. :( 

My heart felt like it was ripped out of my chest last night, but I stayed strong and didn't smoke. :)  I ~~like~~ **love** the way I feel even after only 3 days of no smoking. I was definitely more emotional about it than I normally would have been when I was smoking, but I am really trying to stay positive! 

Thanks /r/stopsmoking for your support! I really want this!

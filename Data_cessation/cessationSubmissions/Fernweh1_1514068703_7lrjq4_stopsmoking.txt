Went out with friends for the first time....

... we drank and stayed in a bar where smoking inside is allowed. Since alkohol was always my trigger number one, I am so proud now that I managed to stay strong. Two months ago I would not have believed that such a scenario would be possible, but here I am. If I can do it - so can you. I feel the benefits from not smoking every day and I am sure this time I quit forever.

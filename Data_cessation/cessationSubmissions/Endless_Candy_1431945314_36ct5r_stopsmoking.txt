I'm half way through Allen cars easy way and haven't had a smoke in 2 days but the book explicitly states to keep smoking until your done. I don't want to buy another pack.

Did anyone else here ignore the big rule and stop half way through? I really don't want to but I don't want to blow the 1 major rule

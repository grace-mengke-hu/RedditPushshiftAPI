Saying goodbye to smoking one cough at a time

Just to say I'm still not smoking, this subreddit was a huge help. I've been ill this week with a sore throat, lost voice and cough and my body has been getting rid off all that nasty stuff. (Without too much detail, apparently if what you cough up is brown, it's from smoking) I've never enjoyed coughing so much before. So stay strong new quitters and in a just a few weeks you can cough up tar too!!

Help, I need this to end

So I just dicovered you guys, not really surprised that it exists, anyway I quit two years ago around this time of the year, everyone was really proud of me and i felt real good I had more money it was awesome, and it lasted for about 8 months then I relapsed, I dont know why but it happened. When i started again I decided i wasnt going to tell my girlfriend, I figured I was for so long and I'll just stop again before she finds out or I'll get caught and that would be that.  But I never stopped, never got caught and am still with her, I now live with her and plan to ask her to marry me. It's been so long that I really dont want to have that fight with her, everything besides this is great and because of the time its been I dont want it to blow up into something bigger, since she really doesnt understand addiction, she smoked in college and it never stuck some how, I had one and essentially never looked back. I just want to get it over and quit, and just stop leading some double life that just makes me feel like garbage everyday.

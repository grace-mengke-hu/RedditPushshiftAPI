tonight, I won't even make an exception for this

Had a very upsetting talk with husband while he's drinking  (750 down so far). I'm laying in bed still crying.  I was desperate to go smoke.  THIS, if only at times like THIS, I will make an exception.  Then I thought, I'm not ready to quit. I don't want to quit.

Then other thoughts....

It's not actually going to make me feel better. I'll do it, and then it'll be done but i wont really feel amy better.

It's 3 hours to midnight.  I can't breakdown NOW.

In 3 hours I would've had 4 completely smoke-free days.  I don't want to start over.

No, it really won't be easy to get here again.  Days 1-3 were easy cuz I had a bad cold.  There are no other easy days because there's always an excuse to smoke.

It really isn't going to make me feel any better or different.  The act itself will not help.

I don't want to quit Stop Smoking reddit after less than a bloody day....fuck it i will, it doesn't matter....no, no I don't.

I don't want to tell my super supportive friend that I smoked.  Cuz every week there's days like this.

I hate smoking after shower - won't smell good in bed.

These "bad nights" could keep going on for many more years.  I don't want to keep smoking for many more years.  I don't want horrible diseases that affect my breathing or hinder me.  I CAN put a stop to it.  I CAN find ways to deal with this that don't involve smoking.

Just for tonight.  I don't know if I can do it the next time. I don't know what I do if tomorrow things go bad.  But tonight, I can stay here inside, and not smoke, just for tonight.

(Tomorrow will bring whatever it brings....challenges but also strengths).  

Tonight...I know it won't make me feel any better. So I will not  smoke tonight.  Not even tonight will be an excuse to smoke.

Deep breath.  Thanks for listening. Hope this can help someone.  Hope it can help me too when I need it.

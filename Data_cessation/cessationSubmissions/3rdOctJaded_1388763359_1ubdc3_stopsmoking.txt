Done with /r/stopsmoking and why.

When I stopped smoking it was just that.  I stopped.  I woke up one day after 25 years chained to the butt and told myself that I no longer wished to do that.  That was the last time I allowed myself to be attached to a pack of cigarettes.  No Allen Carr, No patch, no pills and no ecig.  

I came in here to find support and suggestions on how to handle the changes that followed.  I got some good advice.  Recently, I came back here and suggested to someone asking for advice that they may want to consider an electronic cigarette to step down.  I got downvoted pretty good for that suggestion.  Not that I give 2 shits about karma or votes, but I do care about trying to help others to pay it back a little.


You people need to decide if this is the /r/allencarr sub or the /r/quitnicotine or the /r/quitsmoking sub.  Mashing someone for trying to help did not strike me as something that would fall within the spirit of this sub.  Apparently, I was wrong.  There seems to be some holier than thou crap going on here that I find very ironic since a lot of this sub consists of [pirating work from the very man everyone here seems to be praising.](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/search?q=carr+pdf&restrict_sr=on) 

Thanks for the help.  Thanks for the laughs.  But I'm done.

Supportive Partner

Hi guys, my partner has been a smoker for years and has just decided to quit (again) 1 day so far. He's trying to do it cold turkey and he's very determined so I know he'll be able to. I want to be supportive, but I've never been a smoker so I know I can't provide much solid advice for him.  Can you guys give me any advice on how I can best support my partner kick the cravings and beat the habit for good?

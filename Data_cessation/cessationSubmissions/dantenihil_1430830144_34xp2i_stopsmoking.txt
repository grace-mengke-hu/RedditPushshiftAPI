3rd times the Charm

  I recently quit smoking, again.  This will be the third time that I have made a concious effort to quit smoking cigarettes.  This was by far the hardest time, and in all efforts I have gone cold turkey.  Now the previous attempts lasted for more than a year each time, but working in a high stress job, smoking just offered that release.

  I have a wife and two children, about to work on a third to think about.  I like exercising and running and could tell that smoking was interfering with my future plans.  It really wasn't about the money or even my future.  I was just tired of the smell and the disgusting taste.

  Anyways I just wanted to share that today is my second day without a cigarette with no intentions of caving so Huzzah.

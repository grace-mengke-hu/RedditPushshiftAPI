I can do this =]!



Three weeks ago I decided I was going to quit smoking. So, I went and got a prescription for Chantix. I had tried other routes in the past, cold turkey and nicotine replacements, etc. Well, the first week I smoked up until day 6. I quit one day before my official quit date, which was planned on day 7 of taking Chatix. 

I haven't smoked since day 6 and I'm on day 21 now. No cigarettes for two whole weeks, and what else, I have only had TWO cravings, which I didn't give into. :) I just wanted to share my victory. 

I have one more week of Chantix left and I am not planning on getting another dose, being as it was pretty expensive for me. I don't hang out with much smokers anymore, so hopefully I'll be able to continue not smoking after Chantix is over. 

Thanks for reading :)

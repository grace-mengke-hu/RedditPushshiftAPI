Day 23, and I have a serious question...

Is it possible that I just really really like smoking? 3 weeks in and it feels like my cravings are as bad as they were the first 3 days. I'm miserable. Irritable. Tense and stressed TF out. I'm a high anxiety person but have been medicated for several years now with measurable success, but I just don't feel like I can relax for even a second since I quit. Am I alone in these feelings?

Food sticking to teeth more since quitting?

I haven't had a smoke since this past Wednesday afternoon. I've had a dry cough and scratchy throat when I wake up, but I was expecting that.

I don't know if it's because I'm more aware of what's going on in my body right now or what, but I've noticed that food seems to be sticking to my teeth much more than when I was smoking. 

Any thoughts?

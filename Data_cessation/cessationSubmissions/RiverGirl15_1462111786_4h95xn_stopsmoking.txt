15 days Cold Turkey with Deep Breaths and a little herbal help

I'm so glad I found this community!
I just quit cold turkey about 15 days ago and am feeling really good!  I'm beyond determined to stick with it, as I have a goal of being eligible to have a very important surgery, and I need to be smoke-free 6-months prior.  I took the advice of a wise herb woman and started taking an herbal tincture called Puff-Less to help combat the cravings and mood swings and it's helped so much!

Check out the wise ladies of Elk Mountain Herbs (I grew up knowing them and they have built a small medicinal herb business on the high plains of Wyoming from responsibly and sustainably harvested, planted and wildcrafted Rocky Mountain plants.  The Puff-less formula is NOT ADDICTIVE, and contains Oat Straw, Dandelion, Bacopa, Skullcap, St. John's Wort, Plantain, Lobelia & Licorice.  It has no side-effects other than a general calming and balancing feeling.  
Good Luck to all!

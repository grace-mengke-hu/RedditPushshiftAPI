Spouses quitting together

So my husband and I both want to stop smoking. I am a pack a day, he is at 2. We have both been smoking for 15+ years. Dear god that's a lot of money just gone. 

A few years ago we listened to "The Easy Way to Stop Smoking" by Allen Carr. And It helped me, I almost made it a year before I got sucked back in. He didn't do so well, a few weeks, maybe 2 months iirc. 

His office is his pickup truck, and when he gets home, I go sit out there with him and smoke while he does his paper work. That is our de-compress time before we go tackle homework with the kids, dinner, and all the other stuff that needs our attention. 

I guess I am just looking for advice, We know we have to stop together because it would be tremendously harder if one of us goes first, and watches the other continue. But it's a bit scary. 

Any tips on doing this together with out wanting to murder each other, or traumatizing our kids?

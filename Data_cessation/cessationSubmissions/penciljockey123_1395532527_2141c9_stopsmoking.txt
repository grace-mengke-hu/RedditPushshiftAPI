Smoked for more years of my life than not and it's time to end that chapter.

I starting smoking in high school.  It was cool and the buzz was fun.  I got a job near a convenience store and the guys who worked there would sell smokes to underage kids.  Then in the following years I started partying and drinking heavily which only accelerated after the sudden death of a parent.  I eventually got my shit together and got myself to a stable place but the cigs remained a constant.  I have a good job and don't smoke there.  I would be embarrassed if my coworkers found out I smoked.   I'm gonna be done this time.  I feel like I'm in a relationship with smoking and I have to break it off and my ciggy friends weren't such good friends after all and really plotting against me the whole time.  With the money I've spent supporting my habit, I could be out of debt and could have taken wonderful vacations.  I have decided to view my past failed quitting attempts as practice runs for one final win over the grip of addiction.

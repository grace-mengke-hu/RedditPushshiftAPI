Quit for about 2.5 weeks so far and feeling sick

I have quit for about 2.5 weeks now and all of a sudden i've been coughing up green flem, getting body aches, and had a fever a couple days ago.  Now I still have some body aches, still coughing up flem and have a sore throat, am I just sick or is this quitter's flu?  Been about 6 days with these symptoms

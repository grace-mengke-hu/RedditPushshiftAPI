After immersing myself in Allen Carr for a whole week, I now declare myself free of the nicotine trap.

Listening to the Stop Smoking with Allen Carr audiobook and listening to several sections many times has given me the tools to handle the internal dialogue every smoker deals with. Every smoker wants to quit and keep smoking. This must be true, or subs like this wouldn't exist. Managing the mental dialogue is the key. I'll own up to it if I fail, but I've never been more confident going into a quit. Having my morning coffee out on my patio like I always do. Sitting next to girlfriend who is still smoking. Feeling fine. Thank you Allen Carr!!!!!

EDIT: Full disclosure, I am also taking Zyban.

One year(ish) smoke free

The reason I say year(ish) is that I cannot remember the exact day or month that I quit.  I'm sure it was March or April of 2014, but I have no idea what month it might be which is why I know I'm done with smoking.  I know many people count the days since they quit, and can tell you the exact date they quit.  I can tell you neither.  This tells me I don't think about smoking enough to care, and that was my goal:  To quit and not go back.  FYI, I quit cold turkey.  No e-cigs, no books, no patches, no nicotine gum.

Here's the warning:  The way I did it probably won't work for you; so, I'll save you time by not typing it out.  Here's what I do know:  Although I'm not overly fit or overly unfit, I feel incredibly better.  I can breath easier, I've lost the smoker's cough, and the circulation has increased to my extremities.  I will get a bit cliche here and say that the one thing you have to have is the want to in order to quit smoking.  Once again, what motivated my want to will probably not be what motivates you to quit.  Take heart, however, if you do find the want to, you.will.quit.  I tried three times to quit.  The fourth took because I found my want to.

My opinion is that each individual's challenge when it comes to overcoming the smoking habit will be unique to that individual.  By shear number, some of those stories might be similar, but don't worry if yours is not.  Keep going.  Take it minute by minute.  I said before that I lost track of when I quit, but if it motivates you to keep track, please do it!  Remember, the goal is to quit smoking and not go back.  The how is up to you!  Good luck!!!!

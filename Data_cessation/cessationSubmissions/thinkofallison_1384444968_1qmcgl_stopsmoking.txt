Convince me to quit? Please (or, really, help me keep myself convinced, I guess?)

Hi /r/stopsmoking, looking for your help I guess? I  smoke like 3-6 cigarettes a day (for maybe 2 years - before that was an erratic social/drunk smoker but that was about it) and keep starting to quit and then caving and buying a new pack. I have about 6 cigarettes left and am kind of hoping that I can figure out how to stop for good (and know what withdrawal might potentially look like if I am addicted and if I'm smoking enough for it to be a problem) before I run out. Anyone got advice/suggestions/information?

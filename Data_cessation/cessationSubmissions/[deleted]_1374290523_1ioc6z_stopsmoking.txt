16 And having trouble quitting, please help.

So, this started a few years back when I made an attempt to end my life.
My girlfriend at the time figured out something was up and found the razors in my nightstand and thankfully told somone. After I got out of the place where they keep an eye on you to make sure you're mentally fit to resume with daily life, work, school, etc, I was severely depressed, I tried stealing booze from my alcoholic father, which didn't do much, then i resorted to cutting. A few months after this, I had thought to myself "This isn't the path I want to go down, it'll just bring back old memories" Or something. That time was really foggy, so yeah, a few months had passed and I decided I wanted to quit cutting myself, so I stole my father's cigarettes. Bam. That did the trick, it mellowed me out and allowed me to get my thoughts together and think clearly, this went on for a year or two and here I am now. I smoke maybe four times a day, and when I don't I get the urges to cut again or really irritable. I'd like help quitting this horrible habit, but I've tried and failed, please help.

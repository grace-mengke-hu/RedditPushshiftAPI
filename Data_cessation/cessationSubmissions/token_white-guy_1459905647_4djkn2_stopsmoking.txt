Feeling braindead

After about 12 hours of not smoking I start to feel brain dead. I literally feel stupid, especially when I'm in class and it's like I can't focus on anything at all. People talking to me just get drowned out by random thoughts and it feels like I can't do anything about it. Any idea how long this will persist?

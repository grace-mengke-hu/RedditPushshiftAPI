Does it ever end? Even in dreams now?

Last night I dreamed it was my 85th birthday. In my dream I woke up all excited because I knew I lived long enough to where I can start smoking again since I wouldn't live long enough for lung cancer to kill me. This is after one year and three months of not smoking. I woke up very sad. I'm starting to dream about smoking again after all these months. Does it ever end?

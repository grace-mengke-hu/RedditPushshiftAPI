kind of my public 'I quit' diary

200 days. 

Two. Hundred. Days.

I have never been fitter. I have never been healthier. I have never been happier.

I spent all winter training, cycling, running, climbing. Being physical, being outside, exerting, pushing, straining. It's all part of me now. I spent all winter peeling away excuses. None of them stuck as tightly as I thought.

200 days. My life is as different as it could be. I didn't know how scrunched up and twisted my self-image was behind a cloud of smoke. 

To be precise, behind failure. Why bother, you smoke. Don't improve your life until you've stopped. Why bother. The best thing you can do for yourself is quit. If you don't, why do anything. You are failing every time, every day. Weak, slave, mug, moron.


I forgive myself.
 

I forgive myself but I don't forget. I remember how easy it was. I remember how *me* it was. With the rollups, the kit, the process. Have you got a lighter mate?

I'm going to the mountains. I'm not coming down until summer. I'm giving these lungs the air they need. These eyes the panoramas that only a healthy body can carry them to. My body. My eyes. My lungs. I love them.

I'm going to run further than I've ever run.

I'm going to give my strong heart to *her*.


Give me 200 more 200s, because every second makes me happier.

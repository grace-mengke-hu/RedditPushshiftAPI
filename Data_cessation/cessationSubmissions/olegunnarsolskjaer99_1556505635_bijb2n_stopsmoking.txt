Any drunk smokers here? I smoked while drunk last night and I feel really guilty

I'm 28 and I've been a drunk smoker since I was 16. I have never made smoking sober a daily habit, but I still always wake up feeling guilty about my drunk smoking. 

I managed to go the entirety of last year without smoking one cigarette while drunk. I genuinely thought I had kicked that habit. However, on a recent trip to Vietnam 3 weeks ago I relapsed and had 4 cigarettes. I wrote it off as a bad mistake and moved on with my day. 

But last night, I caved in to my old habit again and had 4 or 5 cigarettes while drinking. The guilt and shame is hard to bear. I am the type of person who likes to think he cares about his health, so why do I do this to myself?

In the clear, sober light of day, I am now worrying about how much damage my drunk smoking has caused my body over the years. I know it's unlikely to be as bad as someone who smokes 20 cigarettes a day, but still, I feel like such an idiot. 

Are there any people here who only smoke while drunk? How do you deal with the next day guilt?

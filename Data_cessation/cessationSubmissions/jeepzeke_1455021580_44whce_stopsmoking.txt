Past failed quits helping me this time around

I'm almost at a month and the only notable cravings I now get are while driving. Quickee marts are like magnets trying to suck me in to a pack. The biggest thought that is helping me stay quit is I know that taste of the next cigarette. Ashy, stale, not what it was when I smoked. It's not worth $6 to be disappointed and re-hooked...again.

Feeling really weak right now.

I am still having that tight feeling in my chest. I don't know what to do. It feels like someone is squeezing me and I can't breathe. It sucks knowing smoking is the only way for me to get this feeling to go away. I'd hate to relapse but this shit is ridiculous. I feel so bad all the time I'm really starting to question if quitting was even good at all.

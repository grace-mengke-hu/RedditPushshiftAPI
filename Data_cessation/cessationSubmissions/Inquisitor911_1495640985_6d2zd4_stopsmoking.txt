Has anyone else quit Chantix abruptly?

I successfully quit smoking for 3 weeks with Chantix, but my insurance will not pay for more than the starting month, and my doctor is not communicating with me... If I'd known this earlier, I would have been able to taper down, but it turns out that I will have to stop Chantix abruptly in about 36 hours unless some miracle happens.

I just want to know if anyone else has been in the same boat as me, and I guess I want reassurance that I'm not going to have seizures or relapse or something... This is really stressing me out.

Running and (not) smoking

Yes yes, it's a no brainer that smoking 3 cigarettes before running can't be good. Clearly smoking after running is just as bad for the restitution. I know it. However, still after 1000 km adding footprints on the asphalt, I am still doing just that. 

The worst is not really the effect on the training, no the worst is its a bad story. I have tried now for 7 months to rewrite my life story, and I doing pretty well working towards my first ever marathon at age 40 (i.e. In April 2017). I am proud. Nonetheless, the good story often turns into the subject of smoking and running, instead of the life changer it is for me to get up from the chair and out running 5 times a week. 

I will run this marathon. I want to do it in less than 4 hours, and I want to tell the good story, so this smoking habit needs to go.. 

Running and (not) smoking is official on air... Please arrow this one up on the top, I am sure a lot of skeletons will fall out and maybe we can motivate a few more to change their story...

Day 4 - doing better

I am doing better psychologically (thanks again for everyone’s helpful comments on my Day 2 meltdown), even though I am way worse physically. Horrible exhaustion with insomnia, brain fog, mood swings. When I’m about to snap at my SO for no reason I leave the room instead. Time drags on and on, and I feel very ADD. 

But - I’m feeling more confident and happy about my decision to quit. I bought nicotine lozenges and have been using 2 a day. Telling myself that it is better to use NRT than cave in and go buy a pack. I know cold turkey is associated with better success rates, but in my case, I think I need to work on the psychological withdrawal before 100% dealing with the physical. 

I started an online certification course in non-profit management and, once the brain fog lifts in a few days, will make that my month’s goal (so I can associate my first month of quitting with something positive and still being able to work). Was also able to get off my butt and cook a healthy dinner tonight. 

It’s so weird that even though I’m using teeny bits of NRT the withdrawal is still very, very strong...

What to expect further on down the road?

This is my first post here . Anyway , I finally quit after reading Allen Carr's Easyway and while reading the book ,it felt like I'd been under some satanic hypnosis for all those years I'd been a smoker . It's been only six days but I already feel pretty good . All of the days so far went pretty smooth except for the fifth and sixth day . Last two days I've felt like every atom of my body is trying to convince me to smoke . I don't know what to expect .

Suddenly Struggling

So far it's been a breeze to quit. I've enjoyed the last couple months completely smoke-free. Lately I'm struggling as I'm still experiencing some digestive issues and put on a couple pounds. I'm a runner and work out about 4-5 times a week. My food intake hasn't increased at all. But here we are. I realize pounds can be lost and it's only a couple, but suddenly I'm freaking out and a cigarette is getting way too tempting to get everything going again.

Help!

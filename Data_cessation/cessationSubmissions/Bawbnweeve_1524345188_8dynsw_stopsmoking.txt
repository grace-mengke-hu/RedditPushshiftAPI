My husband quit today. I’ve been smoke free for 7 months

I know this is probably not a smart question but how do I support him in his quit? He says I’m being an asshole by mentioning his quit and I should just let him be which I am trying to do. I don’t want to discourage him.  But even though I’m 7 months along I’m a little raw still. I’m just so damn glad he’s quitting. Help me be supportive please!

Learning to quit smoking is a lot like learning to ride a bike

When you quit smoking you find your self uncomfortable in the environment. You are not used to not smoking. But eventually you learn how to do thing you always did, but without smoking. The road may be bumpy. You may fall couple of times. At first It may look scary. You maybe need help. But, as long as you are trying and doing it you become more confident. Just hold tight on the handlebars and believe in your self. All you have to do to make your quit happen is to never take another puff.

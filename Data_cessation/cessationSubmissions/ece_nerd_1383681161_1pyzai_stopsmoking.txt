I quit December 2012. The main reason in doing so was for the girl I was dating at the time. We ended up breaking up but I stayed quit (for the most part) which was probably the most positive thing I've ever done for myself. On a handful of drunken occasions I've cheated but all-in-all I've had about a pack of cigarettes during this time period. I've also been working out for the past 4 months and have never felt better in my life (22M).

First time I cheated I was pretty devastated but at the end of the day for me it's not a matter of being perfect, it's about constant improvement.

I've also encouraged my two sisters to quit and am working on my brother now.

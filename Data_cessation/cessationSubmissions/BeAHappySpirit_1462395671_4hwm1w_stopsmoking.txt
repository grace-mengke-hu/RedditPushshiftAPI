I am desperate for a support group

I have been smoking since 1995. I actually replaced smoking for vaping a couple of years ago, and slowly weaned off of nicotine for nearly a year. I found that I was able to put down my mechanical mod and go days without using it. I quit for about a year. As many of you know, it only took the 'one' cigarette.  I didn't think I needed to worry because it tasted like ass, and I could smell the smoke all over me from my throat to my clothes. But, the idiot addict in me came out and I bought a pack. I can no longer vape. I got sick and would cough, let me rephrase that- wretch. My body refused the foggy humidity I put in my lungs. Yet, it is okay with the burning smoke?? Everyone I know smokes, and the real meetings at my employment happens during our smoke breaks. I have tried repeatedly to quit and I curse my lack of will power. Aside from smoking, I try to keep a healthy lifestyle, and I hate reaching for scripts. But I have 2 months worth of Wellbutrin waiting for me to start taking it. 

That one year I quit was the best year. Things smelled so nice, and I smelled so lovely haha. I could breathe!! I want that again. 

TL:DR
Introduction: I am a fellow redditor (mostly a quiet reader) but I need a support group that I can contribute and read to help support me as I quit smoking. Everyone I know smokes. Please help me.

I just destroyed a pack and a half of cigarettes on my lunch break.

I've been procrastinating quitting smoking for awhile now, and I've been procrastinating getting my health in order. I have high cholesterol at age 24, which is definitely a result of smoking, so I've been putting off getting blood work because I know I won't like what they tell me. I constantly have a throat full of mucus. I'm broke as hell. And guess what? I'm tired of it. 

I tried to quit once, but I had severe mood swings. I'm scared of it happening again, but this time I hope I last longer than 4 days. In fact, I'm ready to cry right now... But let's hope that I don't relapse. And let's hope that a year from now, I'm clean of these nasty cigarettes and I'm thanking myself for this.

Problems

I decided to try cold turkey around 11pm January 30th around 2pm I had a massive anxiety attack and went to student health for some help. They got me in touch with nicotine cessation on campus and they gave me the patch to try for a week. Good news? Don't feel like smoking. Bad news? That anxiety from the attack is still lingering like a bad hangover. 

Little more info if you don't mind reading. Sorry trying to vent I guess. I was born with a heart defect and I know I shouldn't have started but it happened. So I'm around 1-1.5 years of smoking and I want to quit. The problem? These anxiety attacks are mimicking symptoms of a heart attack and it's driving me bonkers. I know there is nothing wrong with me but I can't get over these phantom pains. Honestly? I'm exhausted and I guess I just would like to hear if anyone else went through similar things while quitting.

It’s confirmed: quitting smoking has not fucked up my singing voice, in fact I think it sounds even cooler

Writing that title I realized how idiotic this sounds, but one thing I worried about with quitting smoking was that it would fuck up the character in my singing voice. Obviously if I was singing opera (which I do not! and I don’t sing professionally, just recreationally) that would not make sense, but for folk and rock etc it’s nice to have some grit in there sometimes, and I wasn’t looking forward to losing that. I’m of course noticing the obvious like not having coughing fits in the middle of songs, (that didn’t happen that much but it did happen) I can hold notes much longer and stronger, but interestingly I haven’t lost that grit at all, in fact I feel like my singing voice is actually more interesting now since I stopped smoking than it ever was, even in my booziest/boldest days; I don’t remember it being this good since I was in my early 20s (which was a hell of a long time ago). Huh! Never would have guessed this would happen!

Girlfriend trying to quit

She threw out her packet in January when she decided to give up (for mental health reasons), but since then she's been going through the same cycle where her friends will give her cigarettes on nights out or she might have one the odd week in college.

I've tried asked her to look for helping but she's insistent on doing it herself (just the type of person she is).

It's a touchy subject for us where she can get mad when I'm asking her about it (to try understand the addiction and what she's doing to try quit). I do try to give her space and only ask her about after a length of time.

Is it wrong for me to ask her again and try convince her to get help? 

EDIT 1: By "help" I mean looking up information or speaking to someone.

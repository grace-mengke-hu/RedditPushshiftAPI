New Year’s Eve...

So, I was meant to stop smoking yesterday and relapsed today (24 hours later), I feel really guilty every time I come home after a night out smelling of smoke and I don’t want to smoke anymore, I’m 21 and have been smoking 2 years now, my question is: should I keep smoking until  New Year’s Day and quit then because I have a nye party to go to, I know that I won’t enjoy myself if I don’t smoke and it will be constantly nagging at me, but if I do I’ll feel guilty until I officially stop. Any advice is welcomed. Thanks reddit.

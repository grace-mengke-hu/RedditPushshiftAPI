Day 2...

I just feel bored in the sense something is missing and I need to fill it.

I usually step out of my desk and outside once in the morning and  a few times in the afternoon. What do you guys to do to fill the void? Other that that, I don't even feel the cravings or the need for a one just yet. I just need to DO SOMETHING...its making me feel anxious.

It's been a while

So it's been some time since I've been to this sub and I have to say things are going good.  Honestly I haven't thought about cigarettes or needing one in what seems like a long time,  but this morning I had an experience that reminded me that the mental need may never go away.  I was out on a run( a habit I picked up to focus my mind early on when the cravings got bad) and after a few miles I stopped at a gas station quick to grab a water, nothing I haven't done many times before.  But while standing in line to cash out I suddenly seemed to get like a tunnel vision and focused purely on the rack of smokes behind the cashier.  In that moment I wanted nothing more than to buy a pack.  When I got to the register and the cashier ask me if I needed anything else it took all the power I had to say no and walk out.  After leaving I had to remind myself that I had worked hard to get to the point I am at, I am in a better place mentally, I am healthier and happier now that I don't smoke.  So I guess I have a question and a statement.  First the question, do these type of feelings ever truly stop or can I expect them to pop up and challenge me from time to time? For the statement this is what I kept telling myself after I left. That you quit for a reason you are better off now don't start down this road again you are strong you can resist this urge.

Obligate Aerobe

I quit using this substance like three years ago, but started again at the beginning of the year because of hopelessness. 

Didn't make it any better of course, but I'm trapped again since I can't cope with the stress anymore (and it doesn't make it any better, just a 10 sec relief from the craving then it's worse).

'been trying to quit for months, 'had a 50 days run, but collapsed again, day 0 now, I hope I can make it to one day.

Trying again, this time with help

Hey everyone, I’ve been here before (sorry if my flair is incorrect. I can assure it is not accurate) and I did it, I quite for almost a year and got right back into a pack a day ever since. 

A friend of mine recommended a juul and it’s been helping huge. The only thing is I’m concerned of all the health risks in the media about it (collapsed lungs, popcorn lung, etc).

My question, has anyone here switched to juul with success? I’ve noticed I’ve developed a bit of a dry cough ever since using it. It happens either while using the juul or shortly after (5-30mins)

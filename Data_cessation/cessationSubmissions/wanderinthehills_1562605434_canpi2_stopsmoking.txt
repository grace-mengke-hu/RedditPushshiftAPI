Day 57 for me and yesterday my husband said he’s going to quit too! He’s done over 24 hours now cold turkey and I’m so freaking proud.

He’s been talking about it since I quit and we’d had several fails together before so I’ve not put any pressure on him (he doesn’t smoke inside so it’s not been awful for me to be honest, though it has made it harder on occasions ).
We’ve got some time off together this week so the routine has changed so he was like I’m done. 
No fuss, just doing it. I’m so happy for us both.

Is there a way to at least substitute the ritual of going outside every hour or so for a break?

Nicotine is addictive, no doubt about that, but what I also miss, so it seems, is the actual ritual of going outside every hour or so for a little break.

Is there anything you guys do or have done after quitting to get an "excuse" to go outside and just pause for a few minutes?

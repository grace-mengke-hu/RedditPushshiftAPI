two weeks!

Longest I've gone in years.  I've had a few cigars in this span, so the badge might be a little bit of a lie, but it kind of keeps me going, so I'm keeping it.  No real struggles or urges aside from being under the influence of alcohol, which I decided after last night to give up for a little while anyway.  

Anyway, I feel like  shit about some of the things going on in my life right now, but the fact that I can abstain from smoking makes me feel pretty fucking great.  I'm sure I will eventually have to struggle to stay quit, but right now I walk by people who are smoking and hardly think about it.  I find it hard to believe that I, too, am a smoker.  

Many thanks to all the great people in this sub! This has been a wonderful resource for me off and on for the past year or so, and now that I'm getting more serious about this I look forward to being a more active member around here.

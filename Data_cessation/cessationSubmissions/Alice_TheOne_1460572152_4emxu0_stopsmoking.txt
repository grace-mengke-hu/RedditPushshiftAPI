What do you guys think about Vapes?

I'm on day 10. I smoked for 8 years. This is my third time quitting. I quite for 6 months, then for a year when I got pregnant. Now I'm quitting again. I bought a Vape last night ( a basic pen style) and I got no nicotine juice to put in it. I have gone 10 days not using anything to aid in quitting, no meds, patches, nicotine gum, I have not been eating extra foods or eating more unhealthy. So far so good. However when I stopped smoking, I stopped drinking as well since for me, I smoke A LOT when I drink. Two nights ago I had 1 beer because I didn't know if I could trust myself to not smoke with more than one, However, I don't want to avoid social/drinking settings just because I know that I will want a cigarette. I want to be more than the addiction but until I really feel solid, would a vape be ok to use out at the bars or bonfires this summer as an alternative? I don't want to use it everyday, more just social settings where the temptation would be intense.

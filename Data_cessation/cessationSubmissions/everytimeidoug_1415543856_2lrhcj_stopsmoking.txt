What are some withdrawal symptoms you've experienced but have not read about?

I'm currently on day 6 and so far I had one fit of anger at work but didn't cave. I haven't had anxiety or any other symptoms that you read about. However, my nose seems to be congested constantly now. With boogers. I mean every 10 minutes I feel stuffy and when I blow my nose it's boogers instead of mucus. Anyone have this happen after not smoking for a period of time or any other strange symptoms arise from it that I probably haven't read or heard about?

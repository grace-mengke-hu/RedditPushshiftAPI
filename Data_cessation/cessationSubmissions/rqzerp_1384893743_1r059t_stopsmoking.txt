Day 76 - go me! Also a pic of my pup who is the reason I'm finally successful.

Here's the little [guy](http://i.imgur.com/X7lH77w.jpg?1).

I quit a day before I brought him home so I went through the worst of it dealing with house breaking him. All in all, quitting has been so much easier because of him. Can't wait till he's a year old so I can start hiking and running with him!

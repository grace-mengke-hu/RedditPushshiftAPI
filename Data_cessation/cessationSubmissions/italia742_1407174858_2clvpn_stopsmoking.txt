I am done! Today is the day.

I have had it on my mind for the past few months to give up this habit. It has done nothing for me for the past 21 years and today is the day I am quitting. I became encouraged to do this after learning of this sub. You all have been a great motivator for me and an inspiration to stop making excuses and just get it done. Thanks for giving me that extra push. It helps to know I am not alone!

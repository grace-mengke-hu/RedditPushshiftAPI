Best decision of the year, thank you Easyway.

I was a pack a day smoker for 10 years, and 36 days ago I **stopped**.

It was as so a light bulb in my head had just gone off, and just like that I was done. It took me less than 3 days to read, and got me scared half way through (scared because I'm actually gonna do this). But... Best decision of the year, easily. 

Thank you Easyway :D

And to those smokers who are struggling, it gets easier!

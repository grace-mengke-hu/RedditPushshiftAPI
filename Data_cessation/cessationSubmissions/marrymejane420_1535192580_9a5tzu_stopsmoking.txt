Heavy smokers (2-3 packs a day) how did you stop for good? Is it doable? Still smoking like HELL since i stopped MJ and i feel like shit i cant quit :(

Hello! Ive been a smoker for 6 years and though I was a heavy advocate against cigarettes I started smoking weed and mixing it with tobacco and before i knew it i was a smoker. 4 months ago I quit cigarettez and it well fine (though not in the beginning), but my weed use was so skyrocketing that i decided to quit weed two weeks ago. Now that im MJ-free for two weeks (with a relapse last weekend), I continued to smoke like HELL. I literally smoke 40 cigarettes a day and i cant stop myself. I dont know what to do now that one vice (that also included tobacco) is gone i compulsively replaced it with another in HEAVY doses.

I feel like shit for doing good without cigarettes and coming back grand time but i just dont know how to kick it for good. For me cigarettes are *the most pointless* vice and i hate them, but i miss weed so much i just want to burn ANYTHING. 

Last time i quit it was so horrible, i had cravings for weeks, used to obsessively chew gums or take mints just to keep me occupied with somwthing but i still had a next joint to look forward too. Now i dont have anything to smoke and i feel desperate :(

Could you please tell me tips and advice that helped you quit?

Cheers!

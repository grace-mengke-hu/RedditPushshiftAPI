Offhand remark

I was reading comments on this sub and someone made an offhand remark about their coping mechanism for cravings. I tried to find it, but no luck, Basically they used ice water with a straw. I just wanted to thank that person. 

It really has retrained my brain. Every time it yearns for a cigarette I douse its hopes and dreams with a pint of teeth-numbing water through a straw as fast as I can drink it. when I'm done the craving is gone.  It yearns, I douse, It yearns, I douse etc etc etc. The yearnings eventually tapered off and continue to decrease daily. Thank you whoever you are.

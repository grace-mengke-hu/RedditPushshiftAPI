Serious question for you guys that smoked long term.

While you were still smoking did you ever notice that in bed, your member wouldn't get as fully hard as it maybe used to? And I dont mean not being hard at all like erectile dysfunction, I just mean like half hard, like a half assed erection, happening fairly frequently.

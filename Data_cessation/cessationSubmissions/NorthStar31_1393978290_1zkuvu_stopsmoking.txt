I can't get past that morning cigarette.

Hi guys, I hope someone has some advice for me. I really want to quit but it feels like I can't. I smoke a pack to two every day and I'm able to make it through the night without a smoke, resolved and ready to take on my day without it, but then morning comes - I'm groggy, tired and I just feel like I can't function without my morning smoke or two. I feel like if I can get past this hurdle I can conquer the rest of the day. Did anyone else have a similar experience? How did you push through the morning?

Been smoking on-and-off for a few years now. Recently told a friend "I don't remember the last time I went more than a week without smoking." Fuck this shit. It's my birthday, the year's almost over. May as well start making changes early.

My history with smoking is, well, unconventional.

I got into it due to some silly notion that if I smoked additive-free cigarettes I would be avoiding health problems. I assume some of you also took that approach.

Well...let's see just what regularly smoking "natural" cigarettes has given me.

Increased health anxiety...check.

Waking up feeling like shit...check.

Constantly checking the inside of my mouth...check.

Shitty feeling in my throat...check.

What's more is how much more frequently I go through them when I am drunk. Drinking, another habit that has not brought me much benefit; hell I should stop that, too.

Anyway, I'm rambling on. I know that my experience is nothing in comparison to those of you who spent decades going through packs a day, but I definitely did get something from smoking, both positives and negatives. But I've reached a stage in my life where the negatives *vastly* outweigh the positive.

So, no more.

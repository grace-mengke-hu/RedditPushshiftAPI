What causes nicotine withdraw?

So I'm trying to quit yet again and I'm trying to learn more about what causes nicotine cravings in order to help me understand the scientific process behind nicotine withdraw.  

I understand that it's the receptors in my brain being wired to require nicotine, but what happens to those receptors once I've quit for awhile?  Do those receptors remain there for ever?  Do they eventually change or go away?

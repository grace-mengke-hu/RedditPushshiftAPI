I decided to quit smoking while planning a wedding and my mom is being a nightmare

So, I had made it through last Saturday and Sunday with only one cigarette after slowing down for months. Sunday's was the last in my pack and I thought, you know what? I'm not buying another. Time to stop putting off quitting.
I got the smoke free app, which sent me here, after not logging into reddit for about 2 years, but I thought I'd post my story.
It's going pretty well, I've managed to get through the routine smoking spots without fairly easily and the times of stress by repeating in my head "a cigarette won't help, a cigarette won't help."
I'm also currently wedding planning.
My mom's about a 2-pack-a-day smoker. I was supposed to meet with her this coming Saturday to discuss some wedding plans and I texted her and asked if she would do me a huge favor and refrain from smoking around me. I didn't say, "don't smoke," tell her she had to quit, I just asked her nicely if she would be supportive and for the half an hour I was there, either refrain or relocate, since it's early in my quit and I didn't want to have to test myself on that yet.
She flipped her shit.
She told me I was being a "selfish, immature, little bitch" and that I was acting like a "privileged cunt."
Bitched at me for "deciding to have a big to-do for a wedding and expecting everyone to pitch in" (I'm having a 50-guest backyard wedding, and literally never once asked her for any help with it)
All because I asked her if she could maybe not smoke in my presence for 30 minutes.
I've gotta say, it actually increases my motivation to quit all the more. If my mom is so in love with cigarettes that the idea of not smoking for a brief period of time to support her daughter can make her act that way, I NEVER want to touch another one, because that's insane.
And I'll plan my "big to-do" backyard wedding without her or cigarettes.

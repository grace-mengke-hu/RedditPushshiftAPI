Getting ready to stop, hubby continues

When I met my husband I didn't smoke. Now I do, and not only do I hate it and really want to stop, I do blame it on him (which I know is unfair, I made my own choices) and I really need to stop to let go of that resentment towards him and myself.  
We tried to stop together before, but it's hard when you get kind of codependant. Now he's going on vacation for over a week, we're home together for one day, and then I'm going away for four days, home over the weekend and then away again for four days. I'm planning on quitting during this time. I had the easiest time quitting last year when he was away. I'm tired of waiting for us being on the same page on quitting. I know he wants to too, but I just can't wait for him to decide any longer. Him continuing will make it harder on me, but I'm hoping for support in that he won't smoke as much with me. Eventually maybe I will inspire him to quit again too, but that would just be a side effect, I'm doing this for me.  
I do have two work events during the week he's away, and those will be hard. I have an e-cigg and both 0 mg and 16 mg juice for it (to mix), which I'm planning on using if my cravings get to me.  
Anyone else who had stopped/planning to stop while your SO continues?

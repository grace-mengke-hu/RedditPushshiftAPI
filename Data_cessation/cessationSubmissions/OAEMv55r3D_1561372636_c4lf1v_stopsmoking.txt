Studies on effects of quitting cigarettes on brain

Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for scientific studies of the effect of quitting cigarettes on the brain. I know that it affects the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and the bloodflow in the brain, but not much more. Please link some. I'm today one month into my quit (only a few hours left, then I made it one month) but I need some motivation and reading about benefits usually helps me.

Thanks!

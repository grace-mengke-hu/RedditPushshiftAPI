10 Day Mark!

Holy cow.

I've read posts in here and thought everyone was magical for getting past just one day. I've seen people say that the cravings start to go away and I definitely thought that was a lie. But here I am ten days later!

I absolutely do not want cigarettes, but my body kinda goes crazy at night. I get super restless and feel like I'm in pain from it some nights. The first few days sucked the most, but here's what I did/am doing....

* eating veggies when I have a craving (makes me feel better for putting something positive in my body instead of toxins)
* eating other crunchy snacks (sesame stix are my fav)
* running is the biggest help for me (I get to sweat out the toxins and get rid of the antsy energy I have from cravings)
* I went hiking (10+ miles, lots of sweat, climbing, walking, etc.)
* I also have a sticker chart for myself (I'm a teacher, so naturally I'll reward myself this way haha)

I'm also lucky enough that my partner is extremely supportive. He's been talking me through my outbursts or just holding me. 

I think every day is getting easier. All I have now is some antsy-ness at night and headaches everyday.

Keep pushing forward, friends!

(also does anyone else have the headaches everyday? it feels like someone is stabbing my head)

Thank you all for the inspiration lately!

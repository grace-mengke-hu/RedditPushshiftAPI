I quit. I'll be here at least 3 times a day for the foreseeable future.

I need to quit. I have so many excellent reasons to quit that it's embarrassing that I'm still smoking now.

My mother died almost 4 years ago now from lung cancer. She smoked since before I could remember...she was 52. My daughter was born about 6 months after she passed, she's the greatest thing that has ever happened to me. I LOVE my daughter, I don't want her to feel the pain that I felt.

I don't have a plan yet. I've tried gum. I've tried tapering down. I've tried cold turkey. This is my first attempt with reddit by my side and I feel good about it. I need support, even if that is from a group of anonymous internet hooligans.

I have a break at work tomorrow at 9:00 ET. I would usually be outside with my coworkers for 10 minutes bitching about work and smoking. Tomorrow I will be here.

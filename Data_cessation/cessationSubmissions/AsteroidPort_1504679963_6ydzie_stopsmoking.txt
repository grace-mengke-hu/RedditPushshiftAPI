Looking for some support/tips as I begin this journey all over again

Hey guys,

I've been smoking almost everyday since I was 14-years-old. I'm 23  now and attempting to quit for what feels like the millionth time. I've tried using my family and friends as a support system in the past, but it's never worked because none of them are smokers and they don't know what its like to go through withdrawal symptoms and be bombarded with intense cravings. Therefore, I'm hoping that maybe some members of this subreddit would be willing to show some support and share some helpful tips/motivating stories with me during this arduous journey to help me make this current quit attempt my last one ever. 

Thanks guys.

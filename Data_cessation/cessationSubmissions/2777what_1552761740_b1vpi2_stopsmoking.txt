8 days in, getting very irritable - how do I overcome?

Hi all,

So off the bat, I have no intention of smoking or vaping  ever again, relapse at this point is not an option for me, so no worries on that front. However, after 8 days (well, 7 days 20 hours) I've started getting very irritable.

Probably not helped by a few things (FedEx lost a $200 package, have to do back to back social events with the gf that I would rather not do) but I just feel like I'm in a state of perpetual anger/frustration that I can't reset myself out of. I've been pissy with my gf, and basically everyone, and I know I shouldn't be despite my frustration.

How do you beat the irritability that comes with quitting?

Thanks

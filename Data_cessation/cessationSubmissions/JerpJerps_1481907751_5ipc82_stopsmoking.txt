Writing this to help myself and hopefully motivate someone else at the same time

So Im 30 and have been smoking since i was 15. I've managed to quit 2 times in the past, once with the patches for a year when I was 19 and again for a year when I was 27 by using a vape. 
So here I am giving it a go again at 30. In the past I've quit due to finances and because I knew it's bad for me. This time it's definitely financial again but I also was starting to feel tightness in my lungs and heart the last 2 weeks I was smoking. It's has since gone away and who knows maybe it wasn't related but I guess I'm glad I got a scare by it. This time I used the patches for 2 weeks then one day I forgot to put it on. After realizing that only  later in the day I figured id stop those too.
It has been a month and a couple of days now and I feel much better. I also started making my lunch everyday the same day I quit smoking (which I never did) so it feels amazing to open my wallet about 14 times less in a week. I have my sense of smell coming back and Ive actually made every bill in time and put a good chunk of cash on my cc at the end of the month. It's not like I didn't know all these benefits would come from quitting but when it's actually happening it feels good.
Anyway, I gotta say it really has its ups and downs. It's not easy thats for sure. I actually have found at the 1 month mark the cravings got more frequent and heavier then the past 2 weeks but I think that's just because I'm starting to feel healthy again and more on top on my finances. Stupid eh. Ugh what a dirty addiction. 
So I actually just wrote this to help me get through a nasty craving I was having so thanks for listening. Hopefully I can stick with it for good this time and be able to reverse the brain damage I have caused myself in the past 15 years of constantly rewarding myself with a doggy treat for every task I accomplished in a day. Bahahahahahaha

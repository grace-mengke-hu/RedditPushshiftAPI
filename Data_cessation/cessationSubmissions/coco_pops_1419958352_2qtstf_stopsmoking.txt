The benefits after a week.

For anyone who is reading this sub and is thinking to quit, I'm going to write a list of benefits that I'm currently feeling on my 8th day of my quit.

- Skin is so, so much better. It looks like a more natural shade. It's brighter and it makes my smile more radiant. 

- Not smelling of stale tobacco. This is great because I bet no one thinks "this guy stinks" anymore. This allows you to let your natural aroma or your favourite aftershave define you instead.

- Decreasing odds of long-term health complications that could arise in the future. This is something I can control and I'm making a decision to allow my body more freedom in the future. Health can be a numbers game sometimes such as in the case of taking the decision to quit smoking.

- My taste has increased! I'm not even exaggerating, it was great to taste craft beer in it's fullest flavour yesterday. I've just made my favourite activity (eating and drinking) that much better.

- Not having to leave social situations to go outside where nothing is really happening to have a smoke to get my fix. I don't miss out on the banter now and am spending more time being involved in the flow and intimacies of conversation.

- Not spending money everyday that could be used for better things. All that money I spend on tobacco is saved. This just means I have more to  save or have more money to spend on the things I actually love. Plus not giving money to these tobacco corporations who have so much blood on their hands and a high cost to welfare and society through their products (mind boggling when you think about how they still exist and are not punished, but that's another topic) makes me feel like a more responsible person.

- You will be more attractive to the other sex for the reasons above as everything above will make you a stronger character. I already had a female friend tell me this week how much more confidence I am projecting to the world.

- Not coughing up now and then or breathing very deeply at any increase of my heart rate also affords me more freedom and confidence in my day to day life. 

I've made a good choice. I am going to continue. Happy to discuss quitting with anyone!

A night of marijuana and beer and no cigarettes!

Hey guys. Really proud and ashamed (yes, at the same time) to be sharing this.

So yesterday my friends call me over for a session of pot and some beers. Pretty normal hang-out time. But not for me. It was day 6 and it's been an absolutely horrible two weeks already at work. I really needed to wind down and pot is my favourite party vice (as in, I don't do it on a daily basis). But the joints had tobacco mixed in it and I knew I was playing a dangerous game with my life. If I got addicted to the cigarettes again, it'd be a fucking shame because I'd already told another circle of people that I'd quit for good this time.

But I've come out the other end and with each craving going unsatisfied, I know I've quit for good this time. I reason myself to remember how a single death stick simply snowballs into pack(s) a day and then you feel like an idiot again and try your damnedest to bring it down to five a day, three a day, two a day etc. No sir. I've been through that multiple times and I'm no longer going to go that way again.

tl;dr - did a little daredevilry by smoking weed with tobacco mixed in the joint but came out of the situation without a relapse and a more solidified resolve.

Quitting smoking as a teenager?

Figured I would just pour out my feelings while I'm not sober in attempts for tips to completely go cold turkey.

I'm a 17 year old kid who has never smoked while I'm not drunk however I have developed a bad habit for having a cigarette or two (or three...) while at parties etc. This habit of mine originated during my grad trip to another country and ever since then I have had trouble resisting the odd smoke here and there.

Before I started smoking I would enjoy just drinking and doing my thing with my friends at parties but after I came back from my trip I have found it hard(?) not to have at least one after a night of drinking.

I usually have no problem not smoking during a night of drinking with the support of my friends (usually them saying "i'd be dissapointed in you", etc etc.) and because I want to show them that I havent "become dependent on it"  but my problem comes after I get home and am by myself with nobody to say otherwise. Sometimes (read: most of the time) I'll find myself sitting alone at my house after a party, smoking before I go to bed just to ease my nerves(?) or clear my mind. Even when I'm smoking I'm completely aware that I really shouldn't be doing it but I always trick myself into thinking "I live a healthy enough life that 1 or 2 every time I drink won't be that big of a deal on me".

Any tips that you may have to snap me out of my mindset or work towards improving my problem would be appreciated and apologies in advance for my non-engaging style of writing, I'm certainly no storyteller.

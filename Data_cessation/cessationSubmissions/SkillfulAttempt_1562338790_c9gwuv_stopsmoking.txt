I need someone to talk to

Hey. I am out for the first night since quitting. I nearly got in a fight with another girl I didn't want to (because  she tired to push me off. But then a girl started talking to me and she had an English accent and we were just talking and my girlfriend got upset but it wasn't like that. I'm a girl btw and I'm not aggressive at all. I just didn't mean to get in this situation. I just need support idk

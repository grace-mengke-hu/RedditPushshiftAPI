Grumpy

I haven't had a cigarette in like 3+ years. Switched to an e-cig at that time. Started at 18mg e-juice, then 6mg, then 3mg.

I decided to stop smoking my ecig too yesterday. And I have Nicorette to help the transition. But I am so... fucking... grumpy.

I'm finding myself really annoyed at things that would normally be water off my back. I feel tempted to yell at my gf and co-workers over small petty shit. Ugggggghhhhhhh. I'm not a mean person.

The gum does help a bit. But I don't like the taste; in particular it doesn't taste very good at all with coffee, and I miss my smoking/coffee morning routine. But it's better than nothing.

Dunno what I'm hoping to accomplish here. Just needed to vent.

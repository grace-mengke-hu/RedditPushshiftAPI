Three weeks and counting

I'm one of those guys who "wasn't really a smoker". Sure, I ran through a pack every two or three days for five years or so, but of course "I would be able to stop anytime I wanted". 

A month or so ago I decided that I want to get in shape, so when I had smoked the last cigarette I just didn't buy any more, and it's been working fine. I didn't think I'd get through some of those particularly boring lectures, and all that time waiting for the bus, but it feels nice to not constantly have cigarettes in my pocket again. The most satisfying part is that I even made it through a night of drinking with friends without giving in. 

Weirdly, watching movies is the thing that really gets my cravings out. Attractive people smoking with beautifully stylized lighting kind of makes it look appealing to me, but then I remember how awful they smell, how nasty the aftertaste is, and how it affects my breathing. Fuck that shit!

So as it turns out, I was indeed able to quit when I finally put my mind to it. I just had to convince myself that I was in fact a smoker. I reckon that's a problem for quite a few people?

Day 2

So I'm coming up on the end of day 2 of no smoking and I'm feeling very emotional. I'm crying over the littlest things and everything is making me angry. I feel like this will go on forever. And I can't get anything done. The house is a mess and I can't be bothered to lift a finger. I just want to sleep or veg. Is this normal? Will this go away? How long?

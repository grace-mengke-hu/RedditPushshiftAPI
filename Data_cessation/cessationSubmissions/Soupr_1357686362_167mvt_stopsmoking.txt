2 days in, i want to quit but i know my heads not in it.

Starting day 3 tomorrow, which is usually when i fail from past attempts.. not this time though. However, I can feel that my head isnt in it.. What do I do to change this, like do i keep on going and eventually i will wrap my head around it or do i just put it off for a while (this sounds ridiculous) cheers

5 hours away from being 1 whole day smoke-free

Has been the most difficult 19 hours in long time. I've been non stop reading everything I could in this sub to keep me going. I'm excited to be in control.




I feel confident, thank you for the stories and the encouragement I read everywhere here. Update soon!


EDIT: Made it and going strong!

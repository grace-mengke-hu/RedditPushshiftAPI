I wish I never started.

I started in college because it was fun, a social method and cool. Over the past four years I've been smoking on and off, and told myself that I could quit anytime I wanted. It was a lie, smoking is a social thing and a boredom thing for me. I recently told myself that I do have a problem. I've been trying to quit for the last couple months and I'm having trouble. I bought an electronic cigarette last week to help but it ran out today on the way to work.I stopped to get some at a drive thru because I was having the nicotine urge. I smoked four so far, two before work and two just now at lunch. I threw away my zippo and pack when I came in from lunch.

I considering getting another electronic to help me quit. I'm not sure if I should. I just need help.

Day 1 Again. Why do I like this disgusting habit :(

I quit for a somewhere around 6 months, and then had those moments "one at the bar will be ok", "this concert warrants a cigarette", until I was slowly but surely smoking every day again. 

I have been "everyday smoking" again for maybe 2-3 months? I knew with every one that I lit, that it was a bad idea. I knew I should be getting back on the wagon and I knew I would regret it later.

All of those things true. I had a hard time kicking myself in the ass to quit again, but here I am. I did it once, I can do it again. I will say that today's day 1, doesn't seem as hard as last time day 1 - so that is a plus. 

For those of you who have actually been able to stay clean, how do you get over the thought of LIKING smoking? I'm quitting because I don't want it to kill me, I don't want to smell, and I don't want to waste my money. The problem is that I still LIKE it. I don't really know myself as a non smoker... 

Thanks guys.

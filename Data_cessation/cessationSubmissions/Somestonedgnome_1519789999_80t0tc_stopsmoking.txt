How I quit.

Snuff..no, not the trashy movies but nasal snuff; powdered tobacco you sniff into your nose. You might see this as just trading one addiction for another but hey...why not? Unlike cigarettes snuffs greatest danger to your health is rhinitis, which I will gladly take over cancer any day. There is one..only one single documented case of snuff causing cancer, this one guy got it after pouring his snuff into his ear for 45 years.  Snuff is cheaper than cigarettes and you can take it anywhere because it's subtle and smokeless. It's also a very classic way of taking tobacco.  Snuff was a precursor to chew.
   I'm almost at day 100 smoke free and I feel fucking awesome thanks to my own willpower and this snuff called toque quit, which is made for helping people stop smoking and is the only snuff with a high enough nicotine content to satisfy the itch.

I'm not being paid. Sorry for making this sound like an advert. I just want to share something great I found.

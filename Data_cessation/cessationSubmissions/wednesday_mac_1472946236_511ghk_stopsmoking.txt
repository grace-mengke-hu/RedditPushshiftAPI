48 hours in, suspiciously easy so far

This is my third serious quit (although the last attempt was over two years ago).

All the resources I'm reading claim "the first 3 days is the hardest" I have never found this to be true. The first 3 days are, for me, the easiest. It's just 3 days after all! It's the weeks, months, and years without cigarettes that seem impossible. I'm not good at handling grief, and I know that in a few days I'm going to get seriously sad about the "loss" of cigarettes. How did you long term smokers cope with the grief of losing your friend?

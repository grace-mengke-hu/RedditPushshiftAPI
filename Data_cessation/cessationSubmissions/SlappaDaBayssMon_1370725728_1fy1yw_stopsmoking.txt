Relapsed again. Having trouble re-motivating to quit again.

Every time I try to quit and then fail, it always takes some time for me to get my head back into quitting. I made it 3 whole days, the longest time I'd been without a cigarette in 8 years. Then [a bunch of bullshit that amounts to nothing but excuses] and I was right back at it. That was about a month ago and I'm still kind of 'bleh' about quitting. By 'bleh' of course I mean scared (*how am I going to deal with all of these work/family/financial problems*), lazy (*creating a completely new routine seems like so much work*), and insecure (*I don't want to   be an asshole for the next week*). I can't really seem to shake these feelings on my own. I'm feeling like a giant pansy and I need a pep talk.

I'd read Carr's book, and I am very familiar with the teachings of the Honey Badger. I know what is holding me back, and I know what must be done, the challenge is just so enormous in my mind. I need help. 

I'm moving into a new house on Tuesday, which I think is a great opportunity to quit, no smoker roommates, nearest store miles away. I'm not asking for advice, I've got a pretty decent plan based on what has and hasn't been effective before. I'm asking for whatever it is that got you psyched up to quit. Whatever keeps you going, whatever got you through the tough moments. Whatever it was that stuck in your brain and kept you on track. I need a good pep talk.

**TL;DR : What got you stoked to quit? What kept you motivated while you were quitting?**

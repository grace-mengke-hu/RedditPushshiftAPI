OUTDID MYSELF

Visiting our daughter in the UK,  I am from South Africa.  Been a smoker for the past 44 years.  Admitted to hospital with double pneumonia on the 16 January , my last cigarette  was Sunday 13 Jan.  Haven't had one since then.  When mentioned by family and friends I said I would have to be weaned.....could not just stop. I HAVE GONE COLD TURKEY.  NEVER IN MY WILDEST DREAMS DID I THINK THIS WOULD BE ME.  FROM SMOKING 40 + TO NOTHING.   Can't believe it.  Pray for daily strength.

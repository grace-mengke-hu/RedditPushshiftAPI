I slipped last weekend. Shall I reset my flair?

I got drunk with a girl-friend and had a few puffs, maybe 5, from the cigarette she rolled herself. I do regret doing it, however I feel like it's not a big deal - I don't want to do it again. Do you guys feel like I deserve to be punished and reset my flair?

Today is my quit day.

Cold turkey. Haven't totally convinced myself I can do it. Still have my pack in the freezer. It's been an hour and half and I've bargained with myself 4-5 times. It took me an hour to get out of bed and come downstairs. I was scared. Now I'm down here at my work desk and the brain fog is intense. LITERALLY ITS BEEN AN HOUR, THIS IS OVER THE TOP. It has to be anxiety of thinking I will never have a cigarette again.

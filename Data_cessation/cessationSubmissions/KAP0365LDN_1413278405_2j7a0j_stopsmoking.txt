9 days down... :D

I've been a smoker for 9 years, and was up to at least 20 a day.

Quit 9 days ago now and already I feel so different, I bought myself an expensive watch to motivate myself as I can either pay for something really pretty or waste my money on cigarettes.

I have been suffering from Insomnia for months now, since stopping smoking I have slept so much better. Also no stiffness in the morning or cramp at night, and can breath so much easier. I was coughing a lot, this has got easier and my mouth is not so dry. I used to wake up gagging for water at night but no more. I have so much more energy already! 

Amazing the difference that quitting makes, I've resisted cravings around other smokers and whilst drinking (a big trigger for me) and my partner has also given up, which helps as we support and motivate each other. 

Tracking my progress with an app so I can see how much money I'm saving and how my health statistics are improving. 

This is the 3rd time in 2 years that I have attempted to quit and I feel so much more positive! 

Wishing luck to everyone else!

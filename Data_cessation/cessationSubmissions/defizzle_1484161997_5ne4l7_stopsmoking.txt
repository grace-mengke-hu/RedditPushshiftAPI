Trying to quit as of now

Hey all.. an hour ago I smoked my last cigarette and it just tasted horrible all of a sudden. 
It got me thinking to quit and the reasons why I want to quit.
I feel I am comitting more to quitting when I post it online for you too read.
The main reason I want to stop smoking is because of my 4 month old daughter, it really scares me what kind of example I will set for her.

Anyway, just subscribed to this reddit, I hope I can see it through.

Addicted to the throat hit and maybe not so much nicotine?

Hello everybody. Was wondering if anybody ever found themselves more addicted to the harsh throat hit you obtain from a high nicotine vape device and even cigarettes, more over the nicotine. I started smoking cigs when I was 15, got hooked on a vape device similar to JUUL (capable of holding 5% nicotine juice) for a couple of years, now iâ€™m back on cigarettes.  After being exposed to higher nicotine levels and a harsher throat hit, i find myself often  craving the burn more than the nicotine itself... Comments ?

A busy weekend, please tell me it’s okay!

So it’s been a busy weekend, girls night out Friday, after 3 weeks bummed a couple of smokes off a mate (very drunk) woke up went to work carried on, had a wedding reception that night, lots more drinking, meeting up with old colleagues and the girls, bummed a couple cigs. Work today, didn’t bother me not smoking, but Home to a much need glass of vino, and trying so source out cigs, someone please state the obvious and point me back on track. Had to ditch my patches Friday due to allergies so wondering if that’s why? X

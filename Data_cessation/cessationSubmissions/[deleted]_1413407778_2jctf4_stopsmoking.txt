How do I stop my girlfriend, 15 year old, to stop smoking?

I hate it
She doesn't do it around me because she knows this
But I worry about her
I just recently found out she smokes and has been for about 2-3 months
Sometimes 3 a day she said
I'm scared
I hate it
And I don't know what to do
I love her so much

At the same time tho, being a teenager there is the risk of her getting annoyed at being told what to do
Which doesn't help

Does anyone at least have some tips or suggestions??

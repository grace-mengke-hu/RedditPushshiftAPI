Day 4 - never made it this far before, also, question about methylphenidate/ritalin.

*my flair is a filthy lie*

I have a cold, made it 24 hrs w/o since I didn't have any and was in no condition to go to the store. Figured I could do 24 more. Cold is now finally clearing up, and I'm surprised how little I want one. Vape helps, I've had to not smoke for 24-48 before, but day 3 always got me. I'm past it, 4 days in completely and looking forward to the benefits once the cold stops masking them. :D

As a curiosity, I take methylphenidate (ritalin) for add, I find it makes me crave nicotine more, I took one for work today, but it didn't seem to affect me this time, but it has before, and I presume will again. I've heard stimulants make people smoke more. Can anyone enlighten me on if that's BS, and if not why it is? Or better yet, how to mitigate this effect? 

I'd like to not smoke as well as not be useless at work. 

This is my first post here, but I've been subbed for almost 2 years and read your stories. Thank you for sharing, and inspiring me. :)

Quitting both vaping and smoking, 24 hours in and already it sucks!

Decided it was time to stop. 30 yo and been smoking for about 5 years. Quit yesterday morning and started 2mg Nicorette, taking about 6 lozenges a day, granted it's only been one day so far. Headaches and pretty dizzy... Need all the motivation I can get to stay on this.

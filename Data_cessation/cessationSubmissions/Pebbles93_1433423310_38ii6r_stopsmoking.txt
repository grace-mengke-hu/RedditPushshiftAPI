Anybody any advice for your first drink after quitting?

Hi!
I have just found this sub and am so glad I stumbled upon it! 

I quite smoking on the 3rd May 2015, however, a week later, I had a drink at a Christening with some friends, I have never had alcohol without a smoke - ever! And on that day, I gave in and bought a packet of smokes after almost no cravings for the week I was off the cigarettes. 

The next day, once I sobered up, I threw out the remaining smokes and decided to start again! It has now been almost a full month without smoking, but I haven't had any alcohol during this time! My friends are asking me to go out with them this weekend, which is great, but, I would absolutely love to sit with them and have a drink. 

None of these friends smoke, so I know it will be easier to avoid falling off the bandwagon - but does anyone have any advice for what I could do to help myself?

If it matters, I am going cold-turkey, and am doing really well, I have no cravings anymore, and hardly think about them - except when I get a sore chest and a cough - which happens a lot at the minute - but its more of a "I am so glad this will be over soon" type of thought rather than wanting a smoke!

Anyway, sorry for rambling on, but I would appreciate any tips anyone could offer from their own experiences!

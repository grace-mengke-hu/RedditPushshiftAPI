My SO smokes.

Heâ€™s been off working and I was doing great for a few weeks but I came to see him and ended up smoking. Now Iâ€™m having a hard time getting back on track. I convinced myself it was ok to smoke just once which I knew was a bad idea. Iâ€™ve made my list of reasons to quit and heâ€™s convinced he wants to quit now to. I really need him to. Iâ€™ve got a lot of guilt but my mind justified it for me. Hereâ€™s to trying again. ðŸ˜”

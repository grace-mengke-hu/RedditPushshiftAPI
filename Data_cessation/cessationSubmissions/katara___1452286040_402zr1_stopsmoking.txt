No thank you!

So last night I was out back at work where everyone smokes. I was just on my phone chatting when someone asks if i need a cig. I immediately said "No thanks." I was in shock! But I did it! Then a friend asked me to stop and get them a pack when I got out. I went in, bought their cigs and left. I only had a mild temptation to buy myself a pack. BUT I REFRAINED!!
You guys and r/stopdrinking are helping me kick this habit one day at a time!

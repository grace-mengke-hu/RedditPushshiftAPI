4 Weeks / 28 Days

I am still going. Hope to make it another week. 
It gets easier. I don't think about smoking very often. But I do think about it. No physical pain any more. I think I am still a bit down emotionally / mentally. Stick to it if you want to quit. In my experience a day or two after you get the nicotine out of you system you start feeling better.  So day 5 or so.

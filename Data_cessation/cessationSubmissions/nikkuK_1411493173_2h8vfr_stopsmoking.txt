Having tons of dreams of me smoking, twist here is I haven't smoked a cigarette before in my 19 years of living.

First of all, I'm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to post in as I'm still new to reddit.

So I'm a 19 years old uni student who just started and I haven't smoked a cigarette before in my life. Been having dreams of me smoking at least twice or thrice a week. I really don't know what this means and I really hope I don't start smoking. Halp

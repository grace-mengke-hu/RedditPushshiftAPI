Enjoy those big belly breaths!

The feeling of having fresh air and just fresh air feels so weird, it’s only been 3 days for me and I’ve noticed it’s causing me mild anxiety. I know it’s a great feeling to have being able to breath that most of us take for granted, since before quitting I’ve been a belly breather most people especially smokers take shallow short chest breaths, if you’re feeling anxious about not smoking, breath from your diaphragm, let that belly out and push it back in and repeat!

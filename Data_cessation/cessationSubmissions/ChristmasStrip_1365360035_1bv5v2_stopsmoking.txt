Almost Failed Last Night

Man, last night was hell.  My GF and I had a huge fight that lasted for hours.  It was extremely hurtful and I got a pack of smokes.  I opened it, took one out, and lit it.  I took a puff and when the smoke hit the inside of my mouth it did not taste good and I exhaled without inhaling and threw the lit smoke and pack away.  Man, so close to screwing this up.

Send me good vibes because I am very down in the dumps and being tempted heavily to believe the lie that cigs will make it better.

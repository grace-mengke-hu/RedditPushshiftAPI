Quitting smoking and guilt associated with it.

I am 17 and have smoked for just over a year. I started smoking to cope with my panic disorder, and I hate myself for it. I need to quit but I have no other resources. My brother is graduated, but I go to school with his friends and today one of them found out. I cried my eyes out and told his friend that I hate myself for it and by no means do I think it's cool, I just can't seem to find any other options. My brother also has crippling anxiety, but when I try to tell him, he says he'd just rather not hear about it so he won't feel obligated to tell my mom (my mom has a tumour, and her father died from cancer caused by smoking). I feel like he is the only one who will understand why I smoke, but I am nervous that his friend will tell him, and then he will tell my mom. I don't want to hurt her. I want her to not worry about me and think I am alright, because my panic disorder has already done damage to the family. I am so anxious about this. It's not as though I don't already feel horribly guilty for smoking, I don't know if I could handle her finding out. It is something I hate about myself so deeply that I frequently cry about it and end up smoking more to cope with the depressing feelings I have about it.

I don't really know why I'm posting this. If anyone has similar experiences or advice, I would love to hear them. It's really tough right now.

Self Destructive Behavior and Stress

I told my current boss that I got a better offer today.  He was visibly upset.  I felt terrible doing it.  I love my job and the people I work with.  And while it's a good time workflow wise, it will be hard in many other ways for them to do without me (it's a TINY company of 5 people).  I just felt shitty.

It made me want to buy a pack of cigarettes pretty bad, but I won't.  I won't smoke.  I just wish I could get away from the guilt a bit.

Advice for quitting during depression

A few months ago I got a burnout and wasn't able to work anymore. I'm still at home with severe depression, and I really do not want to smoke anymore.

I've smoked for 9 years, a pack a day. My girlfriend quit smoking months ago, and I've had several tries with different methods that I relapsed from.

Any advice?

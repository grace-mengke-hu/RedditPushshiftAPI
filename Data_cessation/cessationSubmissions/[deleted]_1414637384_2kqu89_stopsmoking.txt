Just quit tonight

I was in the pharmacy, getting a soda and a snack for my ride home to Boston, and I was about to get a pack of cigarettes. Instead, I snapped, bought a box of Step 1 patches, and am wearing one now. It's only been two hours, but this is the time where I'm quitting.

Glad there is a sub for this. Thank you, Reddit.

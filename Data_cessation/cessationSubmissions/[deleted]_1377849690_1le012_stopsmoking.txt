Schizophrenia and Smoking

I'm 25 and had been diagnosed with schizophrenia about a year ago. 

Been a smoker since the past 3 years, and a heavy one for the last year and a half. I think a lot and it's mostly about things that make me nervous/anxious like people making fun of me, what my psych keeps telling me. At my peak, I was smoking a pack a day.

I've now decided to quit smoking. I haven't told this to anyone except one (and nowadays my only) friend. 

Any tips for a schizo patient for quitting smoking ?

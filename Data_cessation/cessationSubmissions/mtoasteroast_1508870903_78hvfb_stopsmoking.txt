Commitment waning due to health insurance.

I’ll be 30 days in tomorrow, feeling real good.  I heard today that I may not be able to change my insurance from the smokers to non-smokers. It’s because I haven’t quit enough.  Which is just, are you kidding me?! Enough!? I won’t know the real answer until Nov 1, and I’m so hot I’m ready to buy a pack. 

Ok, I’ve been ready for 2 days, but I haven’t yet so I have that going for me. It’s just incredibly frustrating and made me hit my lowest low while trying to quit. 

Along with health reasons, the financial reasons were strong. On top of paying an average of $175 a month on smokes, I was also paying $180 on extra insurance. 

Someone said I had to have 6 months of being a nonsmoker under my belt, anyone else have issues with this?

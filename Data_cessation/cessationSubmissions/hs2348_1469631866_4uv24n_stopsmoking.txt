These dreams are so real..

It's been two consecutive days for which I've dreamed about smoking, and waking up abruptly due to that.

The night before last night I took like 3 puffs and woke up from thinking "Dude I'm f***ed ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚."
And last night (though I feel like it's just moments ago really) I took a hit and just woke up now...
But these dreams are so real that it actually wakes me up after 3-4 hours of sleep.
Let's stay strong!

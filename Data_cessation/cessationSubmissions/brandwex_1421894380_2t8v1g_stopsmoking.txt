Don't feel bad if you use patches

I know some people (and websites) are anti-NRT and this can discourage those using them. Don't listen to them. Nothing is as unhealthy as smoking. Although nicotine is a stimulant, even the highest level patch is lower than a pack a day of cigarettes and you're receptors will down level. 

Each time you reduce Nicotine the receptors will down level more and more. Think of your receptors as little monsters crying to be fed. You can either not feed all of them at once and hear their loud cries in unison or you can feed just a few and wait for the others to get discouraged and disappear. They'll still be screaming,  but it will be more tolerable. As nicotine reduces, more and more monsters will disappear. It takes longer to quit, but your success rate will be higher. This is proven in numerous studies and why NRT is covered by most health plans and companies for free. 

The reason I wanted to say this is because many of you won't quit smoking without NRT. Nicotine interacts with many medications and brain chemicals and cold turkey can cause depression, anxiety, insomnia, and other symptoms. Those who can't disappear from work or family life can't take this on completely. 

We geeks aren't the types that are patient, and we like to flip switches, fix bugs, turn things on and off. 30 days to abs or overnight weightloss.  Our bodies and brains do not respond that way. Be patient, take your medicine (which is what NRT is) and know that several months is better than years smoking. 

When you quit, you won't believe why you ever continued. It's a reality you cant understand at this point - you just need faith there is something at the end of this rainbow. The same is true about weight and health improvement. 

NRT is a good way to go.

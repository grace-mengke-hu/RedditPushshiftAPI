Day 2 - feeling hopeful

I have been trying to quit for nearly a week now - I can make it through the day but around 8pm, after a long day of work (which is pretty stressful right now) - I can't stop thinking about my cigarette. So after 7 failed days of quitting, i finally did Day 1! Hoping for support from this group :)

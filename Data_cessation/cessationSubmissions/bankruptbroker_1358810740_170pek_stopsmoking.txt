I'm doing pretty well.  Looking for statistics about quitting smoking.

So  I'm feeling confident.  I have no urges to smoke, hardly think about it any more, but I understand that there is still a fairly significant recursion rate for people at this point.  I googled a bit, but I was curious if anyone had ever seen any data about quitting smoking.  when people fail, etc  I'd love to see a distribution about when people tend to fail, see how that all lines up.  I feel like that could help me stay vigilant...

Anyway if anyone knows where you could find that sort of data let me know.

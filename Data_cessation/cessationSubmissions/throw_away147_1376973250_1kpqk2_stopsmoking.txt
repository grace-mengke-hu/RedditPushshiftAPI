I'm 23 years old and it's been 40 hours since my last cigarette and drink. Any suggestions for the new food cravings?

At midnight (here in Texas) it will have been 40 hours since I last smoked. I'm also trying to go without alcohol for 60 days.

Since I'm trying to quit both cold turkey, I find myself wanting to eat more. I know it's all in my head and it's just a withdrawal symptom. What are some good ways that you have found to deal with food cravings?

Edit: Thanks for the help guys! I still haven't succumbed to either demon. I feel like once I make it to 72 hours (I'll reach it at 6:00am here), this will get easier.

Edit 2: Finally made it past 72 hours! Thanks for all the advice everyone!

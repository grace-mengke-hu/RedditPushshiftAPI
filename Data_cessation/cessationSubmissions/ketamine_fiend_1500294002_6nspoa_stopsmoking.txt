Day 7 no cigs

Was ready to cave, have been having the phattest cravings for the last 2 days. But many posts in this sub have reminded why I quit! Sick and tired of feeling like shit every morning, being bound to a substance, and as a 21 year old I feel like people my age just think I'm an idiot, and I'm sick of feeling like that. tbh I consider smoking immature and childish and am disappointed I even started. I know it gets easier from here and can't wait to stop slowing taking the minutes off my life! Not smoking is cooler than smoking, being able to say "na thanks man, I don't smoke" is something I am excited to say hahah. 

Fuck tobacco and fuck tobacco companies! Stay true everyone, there's so much to live for!

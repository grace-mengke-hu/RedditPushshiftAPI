Just finished my last smoke

Smoker of the better part of 14 years here. Holy shit just typing that out is depressing.  

Anyway I turned 30 back in September.  I have been working on improving my self since.  I did a major caffeine diet in the beginning of December which has greatly helpped with my anxiety.  After I was able to get that back down to 2 cups of coffee a day I knew that smoking was next. I spent most of my 20s as a opioid addict and have several years sober under my belt from all of that.  Getting off of dope had a lot of anxiety behind it and I feel like a lot of the same anxiety when I think about quiting smoking. 

My plan is to switch over to a vape and from there quit that. I have spent my last 3 days switching off between the two. My last pack of cigarettes was purchased over 48 hours ago. I emptied all of my ash trays from around the yard and put them away. 

I also feel a cold coming on. So hey why not make this my time to quit. 

I want to be smoke free by this summer. I want to enjoy going to the ball park and not wanting to leave after the 7th inning because I want to go smoke. I want to go camping and hiking and not have to consider how many packs of smokes I need to bring along. I want to not smell and have people look down on me as a smoker. Most importantly I want to improve my life and my health. 

Thanks for listening guys. I feel like I will be posting here a bit over the next few weeks.

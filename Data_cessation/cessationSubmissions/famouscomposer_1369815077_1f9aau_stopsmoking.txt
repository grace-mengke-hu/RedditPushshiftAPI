It's been 6 hours since my last cigarette. I'm already freaking out.

There is a weird taste in my mouth.  Everything smells funny.  My stomach feels really tight, and my body is so tense a rhino couldn't crush me.

There are a lot of things I've learned about addiction in the few weeks since I decided I wanted to quit.

1)  You will make up any excuse to continue indulging.

2)  You cause yourself more problems by smoking, and trick yourself into believing that smoking is the solution.  For example, I have some anxiety issues, and for a while I believed that smoking helped relieve the anxiety.  *Wrong.*  I just have *more* anxiety when I'm having a craving.

3)  The benefits of quitting are more compelling than the risks of smoking.


At least this is my experience.  So it's been 6 long hours.  My mouth is actually more dry than I expected it to be.  I can still taste my last meal from 2 hours ago like I just ate it.

Any suggestions on how to kill these cravings?  Maybe I can't kill them, but I need to learn to cope with them because all I can focus on is the craving itself.

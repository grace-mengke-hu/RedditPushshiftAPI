My quit date is coming up. Any advice?

Whoa! I've never seen this sub until now, and I'm a week from my quit date. Im grateful I found this. About a month ago, I set a quit date for April 1st (yes, I know it's April fools day.) I'm two and a half years sober from drugs and alcohol, this is the last destructive addiction to go, somehow this feels scarier. I quit those through AA. I'm grateful I found this cause having a fellowship to get passed that was key for me, perhaps this sub will be my fellowship to get through this.
I want to quit. It's been 16 years of smoking and I'm over a pack a day. Lately, when I lay down my breathing gets shallow. 
Most people told me to go cold turkey. Just any advice on what I should start doing now to get ready for this would be appreciated. 

Edit: my math sucks. 16 years of smoking, not 18

Jesus H Christ this craving is not giving up

Day 2. On NRT for goodness sakes so it shouldn’t be that bad... but this particular craving started an hour ago at 6:45 and just won’t quit! I’ve deep breathed, meditated, written, had a lozenge, cleaned out the junk drawer, wrote and deleted a post... I’m tempted to take a g.d. Xanax but I don’t want to substitute one addictive substance for another. That said, I have got to get some relief, and my pets need me to get some relief as well. Currently everyone’s on lockdown in separate rooms because for the last hour my temper has not been capable of not yelling at them. It subsided for a few minutes but roared back up again... I’m so stressed that my back hurts. 

I know: no craving lasts forever. There’s only one way out and that’s forward, not backwards. But shit does it have to be this annoying? I’m telling myself the animals will be ok even if I need to limit them to basic needs for a couple of days (I have two cats, one of whom is extremely needy as in follows me literally everywhere and has to be sitting on me whenever I sit down, and a dog who is also very needy, also has to be touching me a lot of the time, so it gets stressful. If they’re in the same room and not getting what they want they start fights with each other to get my attention... That probably doesn’t sound so stressful and 80% of the time it’s not, I can wrangle them all, but there are times when I just. need. some. personal. fucking. space!), they’ll survive and I have to get through this.

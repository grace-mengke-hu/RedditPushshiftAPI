Trouble fighting the urge

Right, so I've tried and tried to stop smoking cold turkey.

There's one thing that I'm finding harder than most, and when I give in, it messes up my day.
It's the fact that I just can't seem to say no to my morning cigarette. I've tried to change my routine by getting in the shower first, or missing out on my morning coffee, but I just find myself washing my hair faster so I can get outside and smoke.

It doesn't help that my partner smokes either, so when I see him going out for one, I just can't fight the urge.

Has anyone else had this sort of trouble (maybe a little bit of a stupid question, but I'll ask anyway) and if you have, have you managed to fight it? What did you do? 

Please, what tips can you give me?

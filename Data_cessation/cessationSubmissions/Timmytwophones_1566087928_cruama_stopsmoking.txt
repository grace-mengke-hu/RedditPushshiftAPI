3 months Nicotine free, been craving cigs a lot lately

Smokin for 13 years, Real stressed out lately with school about to start and family problems, I've been getting cravings for cigs a lot lately for the past week. They just sound so good right now

I keep having thoughts that one will be okay and I'll just quit after, or that I'm stressed and deserve it, but pull myself out of it and tell myself to shut up.

Just in a real vulnerable place rn, feel like I'm gonna smoke out of nowhere

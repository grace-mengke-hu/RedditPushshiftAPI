Im coming up on the six month mark, but I enjoy the occasional cigar, am I cheating?

I've been smoke free for almost six months and my life has taken a total 180, thing is, my friends like getting cigars sometimes after a few drinks. Are cigars and cigarellos just as bad? I always refuse cigarettes but I keep telling myself cigars are not as bad and Im allowed one every once and a while, should I stop them too?

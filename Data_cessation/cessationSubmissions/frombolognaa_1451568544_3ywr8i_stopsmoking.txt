I told my parents

I'm 23 and have smoked since I was 19. I used to smoke at work the most, because it's a stressful job and many of the employees here smoke so it was a social thing, too. 

Anyway, I actually managed to quit on May 4th, 2015 because I hated the fact that I smoked. NONE of my friends outside of work smoke, and they actually look down on it. Very few friends knew I smoked, even after four years. I sure as hell didn't tell my parents, because they'd be disappointed in me as well. Even though I'm an independent adult, I still care what they think of me and I knew they'd be upset. My dad has smoked for 35+ years and my mom smoked until she got pregnant.

This Christmas Eve dinner I had a few drinks (it's what we do) and confessed to my mom that I smoked for four years and finally quit. I thought she was going to be beyond disappointed, but instead she almost cried because she was so proud of me. She hasn't exactly been supportive of me for a few years now, but I could tell she really meant it. 

Aside from my mom, I'm the only person in my family that doesn't smoke. I'm glad I could finally quit and be proud to tell my friends and family. I'm even more proud of the people in this sub. You all have been a tremendous inspiration to me and I'm so glad I found this sub a year ago.

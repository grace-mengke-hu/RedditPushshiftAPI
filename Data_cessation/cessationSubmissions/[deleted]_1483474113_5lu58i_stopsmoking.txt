I seem to have quit smoking

I didn't really do it on purpose. I started taking Wellbutrin for depression and I just lost the cravings and found myself smoking less and less until it didn't make sense to even buy a pack. It's been about three days since my last one and I feel pretty good. I hadn't gone a whole day without a cigarette in 3 years. Not sure how it's gonna go next time I go out drinking with all my smoker friends, but we shall see! 

My only question is - do you think the cravings will come back full force if I ever get off Wellbutrin?

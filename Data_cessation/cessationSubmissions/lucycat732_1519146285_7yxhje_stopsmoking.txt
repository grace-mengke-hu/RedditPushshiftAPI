Another job rejection

I just received what feels like the millionth job rejection in the last year (probably more like 7th). And this was after stringing me along for nearly 2 months, and letting me get more and more excited about the prospect. I'm feeling extremely discouraged and beaten down, and all I want is a cigarette right now. The one thing keeping me from doing it is that it is so goddamn cold outside so I'd be extra miserable.

Anyway, sorry for the downer post. I know I will pick myself up and carry on like I always do, but right now it's just really hard to see professional value in myself.

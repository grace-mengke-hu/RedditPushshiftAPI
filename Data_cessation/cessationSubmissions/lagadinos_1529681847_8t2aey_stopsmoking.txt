Need help quitting smoking while at work

Hey, I need some advice

The thing is that I can get by without a cigarette on weekends or whenever I am at home/ on vacation. That (I think) no one at home knows I smoke helps a lot. I know that I can stop because I've gone without smoking for 10-15 days many times while on vacation without feeling the need to smoke.

However, when I get to work, I tend to smoke around 8-10 cigarettes a day. I'm guessing that I do that out of boredom/ need to mingle. I've tried multiple times to stop at work but it just doesn't happen.

Has anyone come across a situation like this. Any suggestions on what I can do to quit permanently?

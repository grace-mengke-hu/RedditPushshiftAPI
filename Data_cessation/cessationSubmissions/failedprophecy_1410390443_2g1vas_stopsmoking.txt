What I'm thinking after 100 days without nicotine.

I still miss it. I have dreams often where I light up a cigarette. I miss drinking and smoking, and I miss lighting up a cigarette and chatting with someone I've never met over a smoke. 

But I will never smoke another cigarette, because I value my health. I don't feel this is a difficult thing to do, only a slight dissapointment is all I feel when it comes to smoking. I've had my fun with it, and I'm over it.

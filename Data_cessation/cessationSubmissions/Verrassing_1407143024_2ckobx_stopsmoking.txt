I'm fed up with this shit. Please motivate me.

I quit smoking a year ago and started when I went abroad for a semester to study at an university. My SO smokes, and I am on ritalin because of ADD which doesn't help quitting. I want to quit, but I don't have the motivation I had a year ago... I have read Allen Carr but now I can't go past the first five pages. 

Please save my life.

First steps to quitting

Hi,

So to make a long story short I used to casually smoke but after an accident almost a year ago left me with a disability I guess I picked up the habit a little too much. It just hit me that over the past month I've been going through over a pack a day. Apparently I've let this get way out of control. I need to quit and from what I've been reading I should give myself a 2 week timeframe, but I'm just wondering if anyone has any tips about the first couple of days. Thanks!

9 months : indifference

So my star badge rolled over to a 9 and I can honestly say I am indifferent towards cigarettes and smoking, something I wouldn't have imagined 9 months ago.

Tonight I went to at a friend's house for dinner and she is a smoker. I haven't been in an enclosed space with a smoker since quitting and I have to say that the smoking did not bother me nor did I feel the least bit tempted.

I felt I had to share because it surprises me. I thought perhaps she wouldn't smoke in front of me knowing I had quit so I had no plan going in. I'm glad she did because it let me realize I don't miss it.

That is how I highlight the 9 month mark. Feeling pretty awesome.

Smoking consumes you

Its crazy how much time u spend on smoking.
"Im gunna have a cigarette then I'll do this."
Wake up "I'll smoke a cigarette before I shower"
Clean the house "I'll vaccum then smoke then do the dishes."
I have 30 mins before work "I can smoke then brush my teeth and spray a shit ton of perfume on."
Its Just time consuming and expensive!! Im so happy to be done for good!

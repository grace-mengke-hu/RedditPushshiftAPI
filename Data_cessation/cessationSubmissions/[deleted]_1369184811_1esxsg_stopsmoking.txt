It starts today, friends.

I don't have much business posting here so early into my attempt, but I figured I'd make it official: I'm going to rid myself of this dumbfuck addiction once and for all.

More than anything, I wanted to let you guys know that this subreddit has unequivocally strengthened my resolve to quit.  I've been lurking here for a very long time, and the genuine support you guys offer each other always puts a smile on my prematurely-aging face.

Thanks for everything, and wish me luck!

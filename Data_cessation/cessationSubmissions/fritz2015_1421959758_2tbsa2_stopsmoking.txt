Did you go back to old levels of smoking after quitting?

Like the title says (err should say: "did you go back to old level of smoking after a relapse?")...

My friend and I - whom have quit together, we're one month off in 3 days - were having a discussion earlier regarding relapsing and whether the level of addiction to nicotine will be different now that a significant time period has elapsed since last dose of nicotine.

I say, that's impossible. It will have to take time to develop tolerance and old smoking habits, as you've basically learned a whole new way of life by the 1 month period. 

He thinks otherwise. He think that you will go right back to old levels and habits. 

Can any light be shed on this topic?

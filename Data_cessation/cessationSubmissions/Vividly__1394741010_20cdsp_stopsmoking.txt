Ok you guys win. I'm quitting cold turkey.

I've been smoking for a year now going onto two years. I've cut back from two packs a day to half a pack or less a day now. I had a coughing fit this morning after a single hit. I've smoked a few cigarettes today and I feel like shit. I feel fatigued, walking up the stairs winds me and I just can't go on like this.

You guys win, I'm quitting cold turkey. I might need help and some distraction though to get through the first 3 days. Any tips? Any apps that can help? (I have an iPhone).

I got too drunk

This morning my room mate was telling me about how wasted I was last night. "Wait, I saw you last night?" I said. She told me about how I was wandering around naked and screamed for her to cuddle me. She said that most of the things I was saying to her were slurry nonsense and I knew it was nonsense so I'd just laugh. I don't remember any of this. It's scary to realize I got black-out drunk. I never get black out drunk. "Did you smoke?" She asked me. .....No. I didn't smoke! Holy shit I didn't smoke even though I was wastey pants! I was even at an outdoor party and everyone else there was smoking, but not me!!!! I'm winning this

Quitting cold turkey

Hey all, I have been smoking for about 6 years with varying amounts of cigarettes per day. On average, I probably have about 1 third a pack, sometimes less and sometimes more, and have been able to put down a pack on a day once in a blue moon (generally when I am stressed). 

I am looking to quit cold turkey. Was wondering if people have any pro-tips to pass along to help me with this. I am serious about quitting, and I do not want alternatives (no nicotine patches, no vaping, etc.), but am struggling with what I need to do and what to expect.  Any help is greatly appreciated :)

3 days.

Three days and not one puff. I haven't gone this long without a cigarette in 2014. That's mind blowing to me.

Been a smoker since I was 22. That's not very long compared to most (I'm 27), but this is big for me. 

So, what now? All the nicotine is out of my body. What else happens now? Also...^iheard^mydickworks^better????^yesplz

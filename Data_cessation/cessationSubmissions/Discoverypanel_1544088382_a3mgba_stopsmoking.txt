What worked better for you: quitting cold turkey or weening off?

I've tried both and nothing seems to stick. Right now I am doing really good! I got really sick about a month ago and decided to quit because I couldn't really smoke anyway. Once I got better, the cravings hit hard. So hard. I was debating buying a pack for one cig and throwing the rest away, just to help the cravings, but I know myself and knew I would cave and smoke the whole pack. 

I work at a bar and someone told me they were going out to smoke and I asked to bum one. Once I did that, I made a promise not to buy another pack of cigarettes. Only bum one when I REALLY want to go buy a pack. It's been going well (6 cigs in about 4 and a half weeks coming from a pack a day) but I wasn't able to bum one the other night and bought a pack of swisher sweets. I figured two cigarillos were better than 20 cigarettes. I already feel like I'm slipping back into smoking and need advice. Would it be better to just suffer through the withdrawal and quit cold turkey now before I start again or not buy another pack of swishers and only bum one when I need it to not buy a pack? I'm weak willed but I don't want to fucking smoke anymore. 

Thanks in advance for the advice. :)

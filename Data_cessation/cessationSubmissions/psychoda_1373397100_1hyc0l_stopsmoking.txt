Trying to stop AGAIN

Hello everyone. I'm a long time lurcher of this subreddit. Thanks to you guys I got to know Allen Carr's book and it helped me to quit last december.

I begun smoking late in life, when I was 25 or so. Never smoked to much: half a pack (10 cigs) on a bad day, maybe 15 on the worst days. Normally, about 4 or 5 cigarettes a day. In 2006 I just quit. I was traveling, had a bad stomach flu and couldn't think of smoking without being sick. So I didn't smoke a couple of days, thought "what the hell" and quit.

In 2010 I was already smoking the occasional borrowed cigarette. Then my father died, I thought "what the hell" again and bought the first pack of my second smoking phase. That went on until 2012, when I discovered this subreddit and Allen Carr. I was smoking about 7 cigs a day then. Followed the instructions and smoke my "last" cigarette in december.

Last month, I lit one cigarette and you all know the rest of the story: now I'm back to smoking 3 or 4 a day, sometimes 6.

I want to quit again. Do you guys think "Easy Way" would help me the second time around? What am I doing wrong? 

TL; DR: Light smoker; hard to quit, needs help.

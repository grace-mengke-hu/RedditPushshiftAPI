Quitting After Two Major Failures

After a Day 330 relapse, I have been chewing nicotine gum for 12 weeks.  I'm getting off the gum today and I'm terrified that I'm just going to be stuck in the same cycle over and over again where I quit for a month, start smoking again, then move back to the gum over and over and over again.


My teeth hurt, I am irritable, and I have zero motivation to do anything (working from home today, in anticipation).  Smoking, and now having nicotine at all, has been the shield that helped me insulate myself from bad things, celebrate when I had successes and mourn when I had failures.  


It feels like I've lost a friend, a part of my identity and a way to give myself time to think about how to approach situations.  I have very few coping mechanisms as it is, and I don't want to lay, depressed, in my bed as I wait for the next 3 detox days to pass me by while gorging myself on junk food.


How did you guys manage to quit the emotional attachment to smoking?

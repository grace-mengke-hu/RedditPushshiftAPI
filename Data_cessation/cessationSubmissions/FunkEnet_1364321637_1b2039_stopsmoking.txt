Tips to stop gaining weight.

Since I quit I've probably put on 10-15 pounds. I kind of think I choose the worst time to quit because it was right at the start of winter. Its been a bad winter, lots of snow and ice so I couldn't really get much exercise. It is just finally starting to warm up so I am going to start biking the 6 miles to work. I know this will help.

My main problem is I am ALWAYS hungry. About an hour after a meal I am super hungry again. I feel like after 10 years of having nicotine suppressing my appetite it is difficult to get used to not having that suppression. 

Any tips to help with the hunger? I am always snacking and it has to stop.

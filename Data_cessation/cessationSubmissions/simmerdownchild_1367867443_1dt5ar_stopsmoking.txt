3 days smoke free after reading Easyway and reading all your great stories!

Not too sure why I'm posting here, but I just wanted to say thanks to all of you for your inspiring stories! Hopefully I'll be able to post on my 100th day smoke free, or when I can run again. Best of luck killing the little smoke demon everybody!!

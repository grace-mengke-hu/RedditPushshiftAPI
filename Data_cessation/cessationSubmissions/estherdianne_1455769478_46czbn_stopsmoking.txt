Day Two was harder than Day One

I think I had adrenaline on Day One from making the decision to quit. I was excited and ready to kick this addictions ass. But today, Day Two, I spent in agony for the better part of the day. 

Every time I went outside, I had to force myself to not pick up a pack. There were moments of incredible frustration and tears. But I made it through. Day Two has come and gone, and I didn't smoke a cigarette. 

I'm really hoping this subreddit gives me the encouragement I need. I'm ready to feel better, but scared of failure. Any tips are welcome, and hopefully I can kick it for good!

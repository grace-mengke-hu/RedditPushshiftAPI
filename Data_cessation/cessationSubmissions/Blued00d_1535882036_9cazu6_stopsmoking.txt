I work at a strip club where EVERYONE smokes! I seriously need some tips/advice because im starting to seriously think i cant do it.

Cigarettes everywhere. Ive tried quitting multiple times and i do well at home, will even go a few days, but as soon as i get to work, the smell, everyone around me smoking, people offering cigarettes, it breaks me down. I always mess up by just "having just a few puffs" or telling myself i "only get X amount at work, and only at work". The biggest thing for me though, is i use cigarettes as an excuse to take breaks from annoying customers. They literally keep me sane in certain situations lol. Its so hard, but i love and need my job for another 2 years until i graduate. I dont want to smoke for 2 more years or even another day! Ive tried cold turkey, vapes, gum, patches, and my work is the one thing in my way to quitting asap.

Slipped Up

I've been smoke free for 8 months now. Last night, while I was shit faced, I took a couple drags from a girl's cigarette at her place. I'm not restarting my counter, because I'd never ever smoke again. Ever. But I was drunk, and it happened, and I feel guilty, so I'm telling you people. 

Thanks, guys!

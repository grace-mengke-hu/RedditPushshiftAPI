Tips on improving concentration and focus?

Hey girls and gals, new one here.

I manage the cravings quite well for now. just thinking about the cold turkey hell of the first few days, makes any desire to smoke go away quite effectively. 

however I have quite a difficult time with focus and concentration, as is not unusual from what I read. I have a great and good paying project that I'd really hate to mess up due to lack of focus (however if that's the price, so be it!).

So guys and gals, what are you best strategies for keeping on track and focused especially in the beginning?

tl;dr; I'm looking for Tips on improving concentration and focus.

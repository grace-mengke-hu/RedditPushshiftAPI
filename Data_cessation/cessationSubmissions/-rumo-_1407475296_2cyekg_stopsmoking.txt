Starting day 3

Hi all! I've been lurking around this subreddit for a few days now, here's my first post.
I'm 31, a smoker since I was 18 on an average of 20 cigs a day. This is the morning of my third day without smoking.
It hasn't been easy so far but this time I'm so determined to succeed. Every time I wanted a smoke real bad, I started doing other things - ropeskipping, walking, play catch with a tennisball or reading the other messages in this subreddit - and it's really working!
I'm already feeling so much better! I really want to succeed this time, and let me tell you, the support of this community is great! 
For anyone who's considering quitting: go for it. I really didn't want to smoke anymore. I smoked my last two cigs before I went to bed two nights ago, and I did it as conscious as I could, telling myself "this is your last one, enjoy it, but you don't even like it", so I really said goodbye to my smoking habit.
There have been hard moments, but I'm positive. Let's do this!

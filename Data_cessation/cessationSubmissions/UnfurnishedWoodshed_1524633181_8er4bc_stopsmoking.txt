Will breathing improve while vaping?

My main reason to quit cigarettes is to breathe easier. I wanna run a 5k and obviously have trouble because I used to smoke. Switched from roll ups to vape a few days ago, does this make a difference? In the long run I do of course wanna quit nicotine all together but for now I like vaping

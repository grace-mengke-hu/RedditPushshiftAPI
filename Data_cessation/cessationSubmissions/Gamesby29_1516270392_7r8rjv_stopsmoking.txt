I Need Help - I'm sick of being in this cycle

Hi guys,

I need some help here. I am failing. I'm 22 years old, and have been smoking since I was 17. I love smoking, I love going out for a break at work and having a smoke, or having a smoke on a night out, or having a smoke whilst sitting in the garden on a hot day; but at the same time, I hate it. I hate that I love it, and every attempt at quitting I've tried has ended in lasting an average of 3-4 days. I want to quit so badly. I want to be able to live a long, healthy life, but I just cannot break this cycle and shelve the cigarettes for good. 

This morning, the cycle continued. I'd gone 2 days without smoking, but woke up this morning with such a strong urge to smoke. I knew I'd regret it straight away and kept saying as much to myself, but it wasn't enough. I cracked and bought myself a pack, and I am now just absolutely sick of this feeling but I just cannot do it.

I hate that I smoke, my family all hate that I smoke, my Girlfriend hates that I smoke, but becoming a solid non-smoker just seems like an impossible task. It seems so out of reach, and it makes me feel so down knowing just how far out of reach it is.

Ten years in and I really want to stop. Has anyone else developed mild fingernail clubbing?

Hey guys, this is my first time posting.

I've been a pack a day smoker for 10 years now, just turned 29. About a year ago I got very close to quitting (20 cigs to 5 cigs a day) but failed and I really want to start trying again. I had a physical and the doctor noticed I had minor clubbing in my fingernails and she said it was from all those years of smoking. I've since had chest X-rays for my lungs and ultrasounds on my organs and nothing was off. Has anyone else had clubbing just from smoking without any smoking related medical condition? And did it go away when you quit? Any help would be appreciated 

Thanks

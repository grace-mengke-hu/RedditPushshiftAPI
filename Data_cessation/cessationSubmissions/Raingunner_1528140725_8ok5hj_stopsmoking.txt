When to quit?

Hello r/stopsmoking

I am asking for some advice. I am 17 years old and have been addicted to nicotine for about 13 months now. Whether I get it from smoking cigarettes or vaping I can't go a day without it. I am determined to quit but I'm not sure if quitting during the school year is the best idea for a couple reasons:

-Many of my friends at school smoke or vape and being around them would make it much harder to quit
-When I go 2-3 hours without nicotine I notice myself to be in a worse mood. I become more easily aggravated, I can't focus as well, I feel impatient.

I feel determined enough to force myself through the cravings and other withdrawal effect, however I don't want to put the relationships I have with my friends at school at risk because I'll be in a bad mood for the first few days/weeks. Please give me any feedback you feel would be helpful! I could just be overthinking this and procrastinating actually quitting.

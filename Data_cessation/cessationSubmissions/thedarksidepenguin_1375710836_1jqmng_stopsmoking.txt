The social aspect of smoking

Hello, /r/stopsmoking!

I haven't touched a cigarette for 3 days now (when getting a badge I mixed up the date).
What I really miss is a smoking break with my co-wokers: these 7 minutes of everyone taking their time to talk about unrelated things. This was the beauty of smoking to me - it's a mindful pause, when everyone is pausing with you.
Also, since I quit I haven't talked to my friend, who smokes. This was our way of communicating - we smoked cigarettes.
What can substitute social smoking? What should I do not to start smoking again for social reasons?

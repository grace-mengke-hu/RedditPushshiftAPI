Smoking my last cigarette

I’m smoking my last cigarette while writing this and don’t even want to finish it. I️ quit for 2 months about 8 months ago and thought one on a special occasion wouldn’t hurt but it easily turned into a pack a day. I’m finally done going through this loop of bullshit called cigarettes.

One thing I've noticed...

Dozens of my coworkers did the new year resolution to quit smoking. I haven't seen any that quit cold turkey start back up, but I've seen so many of those who wanted to do the gum or patches or the "only when I really need it" quitters outside again, huddled and hunched in the cold, puffing away. 

Is anyone having success trying anything other than just dropping nicotine all together? I feel like doing this cold turkey this time, I've been able to "sweat out" my addiction... It's been PAINFUL and HARD and MISERABLE... but only for about 15 minutes at a time maximum, 3 times a day. it's getting less frequent and more manageable. 

I'd love to check in on how you all are doing.

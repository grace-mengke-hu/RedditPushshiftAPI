So I'm starting all over again after a huge mistake last night

So I began my journey into becoming a non-smoker about 20 days ago. Since then I've been smoking about 1 to 2 cigarettes every few days due to stress (seriously, shit has hit the fan since I've been trying to quit which makes quitting 1000x harder). Last night I hung out with my dad, his girlfriend, my boyfriend, and my two cousins who I've never really hung out with. It was really nice to see them all and we all got pretty drunk. A few tequila shots and a few glasses of wine later, everyone went to sleep except me and my one cousin. I was craving a cigarette so badly it was insane. Usually the craving stops after about five minutes, but this was lasting for like, an hour or so. So I asked her if she had any cigarettes and she only had Newport menthols. 

Now this is really really bad for me. Even when I did smoke, I only smoked American Spirits and nothing else ever, but I was so desperate that I agreed to split a few with her throughout the night. I'm so freakin ashamed of this that I haven't even told anyone. I feel like if my boyfriend new that I smoked newport menthol he'd be really disappointed in me, because he also stopped smoking 20 days ago, but he's been much better with it than me. I guess I just wanted to ask for some advice or documentaries that will really help me get passed this and commit to quitting and also maybe not feel so bad about smoking newports last night.

Just throwing this out there... Unsubscribe from this subreddit and forget about smoking.

There is no worse trigger than smoking itself, and for me that includes reading about it. You don't want to see the words "smoking", "craving", "addiction" and "cigarette" on your front page when all they might serve is to remind you about your past habit. Unsubscribing doesn't stop you from coming here when you need help or support, but It might help you out overall. 

It's beautiful when you realize thoughts of smoking haven't entered into your mind in hours/days/weeks...

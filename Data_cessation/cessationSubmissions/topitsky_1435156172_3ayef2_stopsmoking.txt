3 weeks clean, then fell off the wagon.

I had 3 weeks in and all the withdrawal symptoms had gone away. Last friday we had a mid-summer party and I decided to smoke a few cigs to celebrate. The next day I had terrible anxiety for no known reason. It has then continued and I feel heavy headed and out of this world. Three cigs and I am back on the withdrawal cycle? Is this normal? I dont have any cravings for cigarettes and dont even think about them, but if theyre really causing this... what a poison.

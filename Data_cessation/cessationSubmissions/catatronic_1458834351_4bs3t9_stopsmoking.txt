just need to vent

It's been about 36 hours since I've had a full cigarette, about 24 since i've had a puff, and I already feel like this is too hard. I'm sweating, crying, couldn't sleep last night, my skin is crawling and I can't stop coughing. I feel like i'm coming down off of heroin more then cigarettes.

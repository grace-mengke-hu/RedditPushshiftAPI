22 male. 15 cigarettes a day.

Tomorrow I plan to quit for good. I've tried e-cigs (that make me cough), patches and gum (both make me feel sick) and cold turkey. Without using those... What would you advice to kick the habit for good? I keep retinas failing, it's de motivating and costly. Any advice would be appreciated! <3

Edit: I'm in the UK if that helps.

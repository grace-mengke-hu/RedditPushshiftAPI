Almost one year in and I can't handle it

It's been almost a year since I quit, my breathing is better and I work out most of the week. I love the feelings of it all but I honestly crave a smoke every other moment of my day. 

One night at a party I had a draw of a smoke and simply couldn't handle the taste of them and that is about all that's keeping me from smoking now. 

I suppose I don't really know where I am going with this, but getting it in words helps with the general perspective of it all... any suggestions from new and seasoned quitters alike?

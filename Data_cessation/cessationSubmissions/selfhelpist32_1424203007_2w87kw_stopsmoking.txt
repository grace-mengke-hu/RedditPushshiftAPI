1 year. Feels really good.

I was smoking about 10 a day, so this whole year that's about 3650 cigarettes I avoided, probably about $1000USD easily. It's not the money really, it's the health benefits, mental and physical. I can easily run a 5k any day I want to. And I used to have mood swings as a smoker, I was kinda nauseated all the time. It's no good, stop smoking you'll thank yourself.

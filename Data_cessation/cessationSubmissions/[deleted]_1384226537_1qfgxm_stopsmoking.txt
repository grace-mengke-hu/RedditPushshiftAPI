About to break my last record, nervous and excited at the same time...

The last (and longest) streak I ever went was right around 100 days, I think 102 and then I bought a pack and smoked. I'm really close again, so naturally I'm very nervous but also very excited. Before I thought that at 100 days I had it beat, two days later I was smoking again, so this time I'm not thinking like that. Just taking it a day at a time still. The cravings are long gone but the mental cravings are still there sometimes. I'm a writer so the worst parts are in the morning, when I get my coffee and start writing, but I notice it's getting easier, hell, I'm actually getting more writing done since I don't take smoke breaks!

Anyways just want to thank everyone on this sub for being supportive I couldn't have made it this far (again) without you guys. I don't ever post but I read all of your guys' posts daily to remind me. Here's to breaking my previous record.

Why smoking is retarded; a list of reasons to stay quit because it really is so lame.

Hey guys,

Just noticed that they fucked up my badge, it's been 3 days, not 2 days goddammit!!  Oh well, I guess I can just be content in the fact of knowing for myself xD

Ok, I decided to write out a list of reasons why smoking is fucking stupid (aka not for me) in the notes section of my daily/weekly planner (organization really is much easier from a weekly basis) to look at a couple times everyday to really hammer this new mentality in my head because I don't really have a choice.  It's either try damned hard right now or risk looking like the mummy of Ramesses II on my deathbed in 30 years.  I'm 21, I've decided to act now and have been struggling for the past month or so to make it past a couple days each time.  But hey, get knocked down and sometimes it does take a lot of times to get back up and stay up, but the more times you try, the more chance you have up staying up.

Anyway, without further ado, voila la liste, verbatim:

-It's bad for your health.  In fact it's a fucking disaster healthwise.  You are risking all of this and causing some inevitable health problems down the road if you start smoking again: bad lungs, amputated limbs/extremities, asthma, a fucking hole in your neck, heart attack(s), stroke(s), unknown shit that will still fuck you up even if you can't quite place a finger on it (oh yeah, all your fingers have been amputated), cancers, hernia operation (WTF just read that on r/stopsmoking today -> unknown shit i couldn't have possibly ever forseen)

-You feel better when you don't smoke.  Even in the middle of a nicotine withdrawal, there's something there that's been restored.  Admit it.  You're more yourself.

-It's gross.  Girls are less likely to want to kiss/date you.  You look retarded with a cigarette in your hand.  You look, no, you show the world that you're dependent on something (that happens to be dangerous, retarded, and nasty).

-It makes you smell bad.  Your clothes.  Your hair.  It makes your mouth taste bad.  You don't even like the taste in your mouth after a cig.

-Every hour or two you need to inhale cancerous carcinogens into your respiratory surface (very vulnerable surface where gaseous metabolic exchanges are supposed to take place, not this) in order to experience an artificial drug rush to make your day feel bearable.  It's tricking you into believing your day is not possible with it.

-You're watering the tree you will one day hang from.  Why are you actively accelerating its growth?  

-It makes you feel bad, a tinge of guilt along with a sometimes unpleasant headrush.  Feel good about yourself and the choices you make; don't smoke.

-Smoking is not in line with your values.  When you don't act according to your values, you don't feel the positive energy that comes with being in harmony with them.

-It's a beast that spirals out of control.  Always.  There is no controlling smoking.  It is always the master when you choose to allow it in your life.

-Who needs stupid shit in their life?  Stupid people.  Don't let yourself be governed by dumb shit.  Be proactive, make choices, and follow through with a plan and action.  This will give you a sense of integrity that builds on itself. -> values

Imagine 20 years down the line from now, you've got a family maybe, hopefully people that care about you, you start having health problems.  Still can't stop smoking and it's taking a toll.  Fuck.  You die in 30-40 years from now and potentially leave children whose father died from this miserable fucking habit.  Because of this stupid shit.  Smoking doesn't hurt just you.  Right now, you influence your younger siblings.  What are your actions telling them?  What would you hope for them?

-It's expensive.  Anywhere from 5-40 euros a week, depending on smoking method (rolling tobacco or squares) down the toilet to fuck up your health and appear to the world as a loafer.

-You're an active person when not smoking.  

-(Last two are personal, they don't apply to many of you) Smoking cigarettes is never truly enough for you.  It makes you think about drugs, how they make you feel.  Do you need drugs in your life right now?  

-It increases the risk of you trying weed again twentyfold.  If you decide to take that step and get baked, everyone knows that you're most likely going to stay there for at least a while.  It's a risky game pal, and YOU know how it ends.

-I crave the cigarettes first, and then I crave the spliff.  Once I crave the spliff, I crave the spliffs.  Once I crave the spliffs, I crave being high regularly.  Then comes the pain, the failure, the loneliness, the hopelessness.  If I can put the brakes on one of these processes, why not nip the problem in the bud so there's no bullshit, no rationalization, and everything checks out with my value system.  Every time I say yes to one of these chinks in the chain, it becomes harder to keep saying no to the rest.

Read these reasons a couple times a day and remember this:
SMOKING IS FUCKING STUPID WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU RISK EVERYTHING YOU'VE MADE FOR YOURSELF TO EMULATE THIS LOAFING SUBPAR FUCKING SHEEP MENTALITY LIFESTYLE.  

Sorry for the violence guys, but at the same time I own everything I just laid out.  That is really helping me retake control of this situation, getting mad at the futility of this whole thing is giving me my footing.  Anyway, I think a lot of these points could apply to people here, so I'm really hoping that I can help some people out if they need extra ideas to toss around in their brains.  Good luck and remember, it's always within your control!  You can always do it if you want it enough.  Unless you're 60 and have been smoking since you were 15.  Maybe you're actually truly fucked then.  I don't know.  I don't know how that works.  Point is, I don't want to know.  Good luck to you old people too, don't let my sardonic sense of humor get you down, don't be sheep!

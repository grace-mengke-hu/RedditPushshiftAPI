Paradigm Shift

Frame your decision to stop smoking in a new light. You are not giving something up. You've gained a new life without poison. This decision should make you feel excited about not smoking, not thinking to yourself how hard it is to live without it. 

This decision is exciting and easy! The more stubborn you are, the easier it is to smoke! We all know its bad. 

Good luck out there and don't listen to the commercials that say it's hard to quit! Change your mind about you being a smoker!

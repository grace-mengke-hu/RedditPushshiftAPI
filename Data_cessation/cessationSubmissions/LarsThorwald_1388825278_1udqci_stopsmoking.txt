Reasons why you should stay a non-smoker

So a lot of us quit on the first of January. That was the last day we smoked.  We are entering day three -- a tough one -- and I wanted to share some thoughts why you and I should continue to be non-smokers.  

We have all seen the websites and apps that tell us the health benefits of not smoking: within 20 minutes your blood pressure returns to normalized levels, in 24 hours your poop is the same as someone who never smoked, etc. etc.  

Here are some benefits you may not have considered. Here are the thoughts that keep me going against the cravings:  

-- When you smoke, you smell.  Like, badly.  You have this sort of reek of smoke that clings to you for many minutes after you smoke.  And you smell worse than you think because you can't smell it because you smoke. As soon as you quit smoking, that smell is gone. And it's gone forever. People who smell badly are judged poorly. Congrats. You don't smell like smoke anymore. You don't smell like shit. 

--  In a few days, that terrible stale breath you have goes away. Oh, you don't have bad breath?  You brush and floss and chew gum right after you smoke?  Nope, it doesn't work that way. You inhale a really foul-smelling smoke into your lungs. That creates a base breath aroma way deep down that your toothbrush can't reach. And it comes out every time you breathe to speak.  And its there when you kiss. Gum may mask it, but when you talk to someone or kiss someone, trust me, they taste or smell it.  And it's a turn off. 

By quitting smoking, you are allowing your lungs to begin the process of eliminating that foundational scent. Congrats. The minute you took your last smoke, you started becoming someone no one ever identifies as having that sickly stale breath of a smoker. You just became a better kisser, too. Good on you. 

-- Smoke in your car?  The second you took your last smoke, you started a process that will let you no longer make excuses for not giving someone a ride because you know your car reeks of smoke. Hustle the process along by going out this weekend and giving your at a good interior cleaning. Vacuum the floors and seats and ceiling. Especially the ceiling. Look how gross that area just to the left of your head is along the window edge. That black shading in the upholstery is all you, my friend. Vacuum it out as much a possible. Wipe down the dash with armor all or regular counter cleaner. Your car will smell better and it will help with the cravings. 

(Also, fill a cup with candy to battle cravings and put it in the cup holder. Yeah, eating candy is going to fatten you up a bit. But between putting on weight and staying a non-smoker, you want the weight. It's a lesser of two evils you can battle after you've become a non-smoker for a couple of months. Also, candy helps with the cravings, which are strong if you are used to driving and smoking. Plus, hell, you just quit smoking, so reward yourself! Sometimes you just gotta say fuck it and eat yourself some motherfucking candy!)

-- The second you stopped smoking your perception began to rise with others. Now, I am one of the first to say one should give few fucks about what others think of them, but the cold fact is unless you are Cary Grant or Lauren Bacall, you look dumb smoking. And lets be honest: Cary Grant and Lauren Bacall you are not. Standing outside the bar or, worse, your workplace, all huddled up getting your fix.  You just look dumb.  It doesn't look cool anymore. The world has changed. Smokers look dumb. But you are a non-smoker, so congrats: your image has improved. 

-- If you smoked a lot, say a pack a day or more, the second you stopped smoking your bank account began to increase. Every single cigarette is cash out of your pocket. Every single cigarette you don't smoke is cash in your pocket. It's like there is a tiny invisible reverse taxi meter with you at all times. And every hour you don't smoke, that meter registers a little more money staying in your pocket. Congrats, you're making money by quitting. 

-- There will come a day very soon when the cravings and the struggle will be immediately outweighed by a moment of realization.  Maybe it's when your buddy offers you a smoke at the bar and you say no. Maybe it's when you take those stairs up to your apartment and you hit that last landing and you realize you aren't breathing heavily. Maybe it's when you get a cold and don't get the crippling two-week bronchitis with it. Maybe it's when someone says, "hey, I'm really proud of you."  Maybe it's when you hit some goal mark, 3 days, 3 weeks, 3 months.  

However it comes to you, you will have that moment. And in that moment you will feel three things you have not felt in a really long time.  

You will feel an enormous sense of accomplishment and progress; you are doing it, you are really doing it. 

You will also feel that this demon, this filthy hell beast that comes 20 devils to a pack, is actually beatable, and that when it is beaten there will be benefits you could not have imagined. 

And the third thing you will feel is that the overwhelming sense of accomplishment and pride you just experienced is far better than any fucking cigarette could taste or feel.  You don't want to miss that moment. Congratulations. That moment is coming.

Think of these things and take heart. Because you, my clean-scented, sharp-looking mountain of unbridled willpower and grit, you are now -- right now -- a non-smoker.  You goddamned badass.

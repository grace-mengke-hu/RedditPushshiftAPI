The thought of not smoking makes me really depressed. What can I do?

A part of me would like to stop smoking, but I'm not fully committed and I don't know how to find that commitment. For me smoking is a beautiful part of life. I am fully aware of the consequences, but I really enjoy it and feel that something is severely lacking without it. I already struggle with depression and the thought of not smoking makes things worse for me. If I imagine a beautiful day where I'm feeling great, looking great and enjoying myself, if I'm not smoking in that imagined situation, It feels like something is really missing. Its like looking at a painting were all the people in the picture have no thumbs or no eyes. I don't know how to work through this and I'm looking for advice.

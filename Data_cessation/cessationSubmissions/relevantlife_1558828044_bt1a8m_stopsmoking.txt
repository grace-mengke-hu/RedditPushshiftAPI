6 months and 8 days smoke free. Last night, I dreamed I smoker a cigarette and was immediately pissed at myself. Today, I didn’t smoke and walked 4 miles because dammit, my health is worth it!

Very vivid, very real feeling dream last night that someone offered me a cigg and I, like i never stopped, just lit up and started puffing. In the dream, I got angry with myself over it. 

Woke up, said fuck that, and didn’t smoke today. 

Just walked four miles because dammit I am going to be healthy even if I did poison my body for 10 years!!!!

Any smokers experienced decreased libido or ED?

I'm a pack a day smoker, have been for nearly 10 years. I really want to quit and I have quit several times before, each time eventually starting back up again.

Now I'm facing an embarrassing problem, and I think it might be related to my smoking. I'm a young-ish dude (26) and my libido has decreased to almost nothing and I find it difficult to get and maintain an erection. I read something on a Reddit thread recently where a poster mentioned that after he quit, his "issues" seemed to disappear.

I feel like I can use this as good fuel for my fight, if you will. If smoking is what is behind this, I will use that as a motivator to help me quit. I've been on the fence for a while and this may just push me to really quit if it could be the cause.

So my (embarrassing) question is, has anyone experienced what they would consider erectile dysfunction or decreased libido due to smoking? I looked around online and it seems I can't find an honest answer. Hoping someone here was a smoker facing these problems and solved them by quitting.

Anyone?

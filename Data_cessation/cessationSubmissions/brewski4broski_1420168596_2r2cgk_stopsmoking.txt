Welcome to Stop Smoking on Reddit!

Welcome to all new people who have come here because it's January 1st. 

Let me first explain to you all, i'm not here for support for myself, I don't necessarily need this forum. I stopped almost a year ago with zero cravings and zero withdrawal, and I embrace every day as a non smoker. I am only here because I *LOVE* to see new people STOP being addicted to drugs. Nothing makes me happier than seeing people quit smoking because, even though being a non smoker for me now is super easy, I literally tried to stop at least 100+ times over the last 10 years. Every stop along the way was a false victory (woo hoo I stopped for a month, i'll start again after this weekend) that I lied to myself.

I am here now because I consider myself a success story because I haven't had a single craving. It's weird but I don't even remember what it's like to smoke. I wish this for every single one of you here.

If I can offer up some advice, it's to not make "quit smoking" your number 1 resolution/priority. My advice would be to make your #1 Resolution to live "one day at a time". #2 should be "Don't smoke at all today". #3 should be "do something to better my life today"

I truly believe if you avoid a time line, or an "end goal" you will be successful AND happy. Don't say "i've been smoke free for 7 days!" tell yourself "I haven't smoked at all today, this is awesome!" Do that every single day, and the time will fly.

I wish you all the best of luck. You can do it. In a year from now you'll be on this sub sharing your own stories. When others fall and restart in a months time, you can be happy that you are STILL a non smoker.

You can do it. Now that you've stopped, life will begin :)

Ok... When going to bars.... What do you DO? I don't mean how do you deal, I mean aren't you bored?

Smoking was always a nice way to break the monotony and get some fresh ("fresh") air for a bit... If sitting around watching a crappy game and chugging miller lite gets old I can just escape for a few minutes.  Do you still step outside? Just deal with it? Don't know what to do

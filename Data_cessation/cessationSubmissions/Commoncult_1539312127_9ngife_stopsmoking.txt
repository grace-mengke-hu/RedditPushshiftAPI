I want to smoke soooo fucking much. I'm fucking dying here

Day 3. Had one nicotine gum on both days 1 &amp; 2

Since I stopped smoking, the cravings never go away. Some ppl say they only last a few mins.. well, not for me. Its always there.

Been smoking 15 years. I decided to quit cos I was having severe trouble breathing. It was really bad actually. And certainly not the first time. Scared me a lot.

But I was to smoke so fucking much. I literally cannot fathom this ever getting better. Quitting is seriously depressing the total shit out of me. I really really really missing smoking so much. I'm fucking sad

I know people are going to tell me it gets better, but there's a apart of me that really doesnt believe it.

I've read Allen carrs book and have been on here for years. My health was terrible BUT I'm addicted as fuck.. I just relly want to smoke with a coffee right now, or a fucking beer..

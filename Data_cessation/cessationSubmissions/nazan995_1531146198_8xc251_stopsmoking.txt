the downhill run is coming

here is my story: after my last exam in the first year in collage I went with my friend to get lunch and he offered me a cigarette and i accepted it. I graduated last month and I smoked for 4 years 1 pack a day since that first cigarette, until last week I quite, I'm now 7 days without a single cigarette or NRT, the first 3 days were the hardest after it my life completely change, I wake up every morning with a dragon energy, my appetite returned back to normal, I start eating fruit between meals just to keep my mouth busy, and yesterday i joined scuba diving course, I have 3 cravings each one last 2 to 3 minutes or less every day other than that everything is beyond OKAY,I am very thankful for this subreddit for helping me through my darkest day.

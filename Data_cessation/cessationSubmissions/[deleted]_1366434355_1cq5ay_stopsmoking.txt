Mom`s gone for a couple of hours, perfect occasion to smoke.. What do I tell myself not to go for a smoke?

A part of me thinks its a shame to let all these hours pass and not have a perfect little smoke on the balcony, since I am going to be home alone for so long. Yet, another part knows it would be a shame to smoke and ruin my record so far.
What part do you root for? Do support it with more arguments because for me it is a tough decision and I know I shouldn`t take it alone .

Feeling the symptoms still is this normal ?

Hey guys it's like week 3 of stopping smoking. After week 1 and week 2 I was starting to feeling better, but recently on week 3 it started getting hard again. I've been feeling kinda anxious again, and kinda a down feeling like depressed but I don't have a reason to be depressed, mood swings, and a lot of irritability. Is this normal this far in. And also any tips on dealing with these 

Thanks in advance

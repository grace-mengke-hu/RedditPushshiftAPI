Question about withdrawal

I don't smoke cigarettes but I did use nicotine daily for 3 years and have in the past couple months quit. I wanted to ask two things about the withdrawal:

1. I'm trying to decide if what I'm feeling is withdrawal triggered again. I had some nicotine Sunday and then again Thursday after not having any in weeks.  Is this enough to set off withdrawal again?

2. If yes to 1, is it common to feel existential terror? I have been having what essentially amount to panic attacks over a girl I've been talking to, when just earlier this week I was patting myself on the back for how levelheaded I've been in this relationship. Now I'm suddenly feeling like she (and everyone else) has a negative opinion of me and I feel like I want to rip my fucking skin off and like something is clawing and screaming at the back of my brain.

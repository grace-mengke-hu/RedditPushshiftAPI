**First installment of my Nut Up or Shut Up Guide to Quitting Smoking written by yours truly.**

I figured since everyone in here is doing the right thing by quitting, I'd offer some encouragement to aid your excellent, although challenging, journey. First and foremost let me start off by saying that I am a former smoker (I think a bit over 3 years at this point) so I know the pain of quitting. I was a smoker for over 10 years so I know this is a nightmare to go through. However everything you're experiencing, although terrible I know, serves a purpose and it’s important to empower yourself with this knowledge because it will make the quitting process easier. This isn't a time-line guide by any means, because in my opinion we all go through these things but each of us experiences it at different times. This is more of a psychological guide of what to expect so when it happens you won't lose your shit and light up another smoke. 

**Part I - FML the first days are the worst!**

So you've decided to quit, good for you. Sure you have your reasons, maybe it was for your health, for a loved one, to save money, or maybe you were just sick of coughing up blood and black stuff (Yup, been there). Either way, you've made a great choice. Consciously you feel awesome, but physically you probably just took a dump in your stomach because you just realized you've committed to something that you haven't prepared yourself for....withdrawals. Here's what you should expect for the first couple days:

1. Anger - Why not? Don't you usually smoke when you're irritated? The kind of anger you feel is probably similar to a 5 year old angry at his mom because she won't buy him the toy in the store; you're angry but you know it's irrational.

2. Sickness - I know, strange huh? The body is kind of weird like that. For some reason when we try to do something healthy for the first time in a long time our body usually shows us it's appreciation by making us sick. You may get headaches, nausea, sweats, the shakes, etc. It's all normal; just drink a lot of water. 

3. Sadness/Depression - You feel like crying doesn’t you? I know. Go ahead, let it out. On my 4th day I curled up in a ball like a little bitch and just started bawling my eyes out. I was so sad accepting the fact that my "life was over". I couldn't say it out loud, but damnit, I knew it was! I LOVED smoking. I felt like I was never going to enjoy life to the fullest again. Good news though, life actually is better later on. But for now, go ahead and let it out.

4. Restlessness - Ok, this one sucks merely for the fact that it just makes those 3 other things more intense. If this happens to you my advice would be to do whatever healthy thing you can do to make yourself tired. Some people use music, drink warm milk, meditate, pray, go on a walk. Just figure out anything that helps you burn off the energy. 

**My Part I secret weapon? EXERCISE!!!** Seriously, this helped me so much with the restlessness and the anger. It also helps as a distraction for your sadness/depression. If you are really out of shape, which I was at the time (273lbs at 5'10"!), you can still do light exercise (i.e. crunches, walk around the block, jumping jacks, etc).

**Part II - No, the first 2 weeks are way worse!**
So, you made past the 7 day mark. Congrats. Statistically you shoulda failed by now, so be proud that you've made it this far. By now, medically a lot of good stuff has happened (I don't know all the details), but do you give a shit? Of course not! You're hating life to the fullest right now because this is the longest vacation you've taken from them since who knows how long. On the flip side, here are some things you'll probably notice during the next couple weeks:

1.	You're going to have more energy - Waking up will be easier, and you probably won't need as much caffeine to wake up

2.	You're going to smell/taste better - Kind of a double edge sword. You may gain a few pounds. But if you're working out like I recommended you won’t' notice as much but food will taste and smell AWESOME!

3.	Less frequent anger - Yeah, it's still around, but you've come to expect it at this point. You probably noticed that it lasts for usually a few minutes then you start to cool off. Start timing it that way you can predict it better and thus control it better

4.	Depression/Sadness starts to decrease - You've started to accept the fact that you're life isn't over, but it definitely is changing. You need to start developing new routines. You can't go to your normal lunch spot and hang out with smokers anymore, get away from it, they'll understand. Start distracting yourself during your downtime (Reddit was a great time killer).

**My Part II secret weapon? Replaced coffee with GATORADE**. This was huge because caffeine is a HUGE trigger for cigarette cravings. I found new places to go during my lunch breaks and other downtimes. Separated myself from other smokers. 

I'll release a Part III & IV but I first want to get feedback on this guide before proceeding. Hope this helps, please feel free to add or comment on it as appropriate.

**EDIT:** Frontpage, wow! Thank you to everyone for all the wonderful feedback and support. I'm really glad you've liked this first installment and I have decided to begin work on the 2nd installment. I have been reading through all the feedback and I have some ideas that I think you all will enjoy. Thanks again!

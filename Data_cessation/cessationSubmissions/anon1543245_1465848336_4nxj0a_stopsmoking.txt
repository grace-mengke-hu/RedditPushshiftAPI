I smoke 5-10 cigarettes on weekends when drinking. Am I experiencing withdrawal during the week?

I smoke only when drinking, which usually ends up being 5-10 cigarettes between Friday and Saturday night. No smokes between Sunday - Thursday. 

I find that I've been dealing with anxiety during the week, along with a heavy fatigue -- getting out of bed is extremely difficult and I operate with mental fog for most of the day.

So my question is whether this could be attributed to nicotine withdrawal during the week?

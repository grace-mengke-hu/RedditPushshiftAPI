Just had my last cigarette.

Well guys, I told myself that after my last pack I would quit.  I just smoked the last cigarette in the pack a few minutes ago.  I am 30 and have been smoking for 14 years.  I have quit before and went over a year without having a cigarette.  I tried recently to quit, a few months back, and went 7 days before caving in.

I desperately want to do this.  I am sick of the smell, the worry that I am going to contract some smoking related disease, and I am trying to have a baby with my fiancee so I don't want my fertility to be effected.  

I am scared right now.  Scared that I will have to deal with the withdrawal.  Last time I quit smoking I was a nervous wreck.  I tried cold turkey and ended up with horrible withdrawal symptoms, particularly anxiety and panic attacks which I am prone to.  That being said, I still made it 7 days.  This time around I have nicotine gum which I am perfectly ok with taking.  I just don't know if I should start chewing it regularly or wait until cravings hit.  I called the smokers helpline and am awaiting a call from a counselor to talk more about my quit plan.  

I don't want to ever smoke again.  But I am scared to death right now.  Wish me luck

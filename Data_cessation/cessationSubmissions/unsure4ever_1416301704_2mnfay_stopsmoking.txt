Never again will I bow to addiction...

2014 has been a great year for me. I have rediscovered myself. I am now more positive than ever and I am content. The only sour note has been my smoking. I have cut down hard and am now down to two per day ( for the past 2 months.) 

But I have been unable to go further. I couldn't bring myself to quit. 

I quit a lot of things this year: masturbation, porn, gaming. But I wasn't able to quit smoking. This changes today.

(I was running away from reality into a fantasy world via books and video games. I am now tuning myself back to reality.) 

So from today onwards, I am going to quit smoking. Never again in my life will I smoke. 

Will get and set my badge today.

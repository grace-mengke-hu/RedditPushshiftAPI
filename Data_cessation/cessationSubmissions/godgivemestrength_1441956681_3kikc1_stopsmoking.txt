I know Alan Carr off by heart

and they are the best arguments out there.  I've been to 4 sessions, I've read the book and know the app off by heart.  I do 2 weeks and then cave.  Everyone says you'll start to feel better and have more energy but I don't.  I am giving up today, I hope for the last time.  If I THINK about smoking, I wouldn't light up.  I smoke when I feel mentally lazy and do it without thinking.  Any tips from ex Alan Carr groupies would be gratefully received!

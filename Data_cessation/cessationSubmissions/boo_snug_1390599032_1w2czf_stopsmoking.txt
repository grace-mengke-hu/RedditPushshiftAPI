I quit...though not the way I was expecting.

At the end of last year, I was really thinking hard about quitting.  I lurked around here, downloaded some apps, and talked about it - but I never actually quit lighting up cigarettes.  My SO smokes, and a lot of the people I am around smoke, but I knew in my heart I needed to quit.  I am 24 years old, been smoking since i was 18 or 19.  I have had asthma my entire life and I hated identifying myself as a smoker.  

Anyways, I had some asthma related issues at the end of last year, and on New Years Eve I went to the ER hoping to just get a breathing treatment and then leave to celebrate the new year.  I was very wrong.  I left the ER with my SO and returned a few hours later barely able to breathe.  I was intubated, sent to the ICU and spent a week on a ventilator.  I had acute respiratory failure, pneumonia, the flu and became septic.

I am not saying smoking caused all or any of this, but I haven't had a cigarette or a craving for a cigarette since this happened.  I also know I have a very long road ahead of me and that a craving can strike anytime! I am not even back to my old routine, I am still recouping and not working.  However, my fear of actually stopping smoking, of quitting to light up cigarettes, has been conquered.  My lungs feel better and I actually feel motivated to make improvements in other aspects of my life, like working out and being active (just to name a few).

Anyways, I just wanted to share my story but I also wanted to say thank you to everyone for the amazing support that is offered here.  I wouldn't recommend to quit the way I did (I have a very costly medical bill with my name on it!) but I am so very grateful and thankful for my 23 days smoke free.

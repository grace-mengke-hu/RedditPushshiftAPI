Got past the honeymoon phase, now what?

I have gone 16 days without smoking and I feel much healthier for it. I am at University. I have used the time I spent smoking to learn the guitar, and the increased taste/smell I have gained has given me the push to turn vegetarian (When you cant taste anything properly, crappy meat products go down just fine). 

Anyway, my problem. 

I feel like I have cheated. Although I have gone cold turkey and not had a single puff, I feel like my quit has relied on avoiding smoking situations, which has changed how I am as a person. Not saying smoking was my identity, but it basically was. Now, I feel I am distancing myself from friends, opting out of socialising when I would normally thrive, and generally just being reclusive. Not only this, but I feel like I am more socially awkward without cigarettes. I am putting a lot of energy into self improvement but its a long term satisfaction rather than a short term one and I am yet to see the results. 

Can anyone help me overcome these doubts? How did you adjust to not smoking, and changing your identity without undermining the whole social circle and character you have formed around you? 

Also, I am struggling with the reducing additional achievement felt from each day of quitting, one extra day is easier and less of a proportion of the overall total. How do you keep yourself motivated? 

Thanks for the help, I am not going to fail, but I dont want to succeed and be miserable! 

P.s WHAT DO YOU DO WITH YOUR HANDS/ARMS WHEN YOU SOCIALISE?

How do I replace the social side of smoking?

I suffer from extreme social anxiety, and find it hard to talk to people when I'm out.

The only thing that (hugely) helped me was smoking. If I was in bar bar for example the only time I could get talking to people was out in the smoking area. Same with the smoking area at work, or anywhere else for that matter.

Now that I have quit smoking, how do I replace the whole social element? I've thought about this for ages - even to the point of coming up with ideas for a startup company around it. However, I have come up with nothing.

My anxiety is through the roof and don't want to start smoking again for obvious reasons - yet I need to find an excuse to talk to people when I'm out and about - and smoking was that excuse.

Has anyone got any ideas?

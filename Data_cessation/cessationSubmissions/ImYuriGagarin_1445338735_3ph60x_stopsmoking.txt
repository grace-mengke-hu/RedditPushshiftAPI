10th night!

I'm about to try and sleep for the 11th time since I quit, it's literally not let me sleep more than 2 - 3 hours since day 1... Is this weird? I feel great other than the sleep thing... 
Is it any possibility that the anxiety I'm feeling (never had a problem with it before) is causing me to wake in the middle of my sleep? And is day 1 normal to not sleep? :/
I smoked maybe a pack a day for 9 years. And I'm done!

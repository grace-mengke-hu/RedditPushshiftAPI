Roommate who smokes

I'm on day 2 of quitting, I've attempted to quit many times (as I'm sure everyone has) and lasted varying lengths of time from 1 week to 4 months. 

I don't use e cigs and I've tried gum but I still fundamentally have an issue with continuing to feed a nicotine addiction without smoking so I quit cold turkey.

The common hurdles of stress, drinking etc I think I can position myself to anticipate and handle but my main obstacle is my roommate, who is also one of my best friends who rips cigs all the time. 

We talk a lot and beyond letting him know I'm quitting and sheer will power when I'm sitting outside talking while he smokes, does anyone have suggestions for dealing with this? He's not going to quit with me, I've tried many times to get him to so that's unfortunately not a realistic option.

Thanks for any feedback, just subscribed today and hoping this will be the last time I try to quit.

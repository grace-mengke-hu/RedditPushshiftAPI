Can't even make it past day 1

I can't even make it past 12 hours. Everyday I try and every single day I fail.

It makes me feel so worthless about myself. Especially when I see people saying they failed on day 3 or 4. I'd kill to make it to that point.

I've tried bupropion, champax, various forms of NRT and obviously cold Turkey. The withdrawals just become so overwhelming by 8 - 10 hour mark.

I'm so over fucking over it. I fucking hate cigarettes

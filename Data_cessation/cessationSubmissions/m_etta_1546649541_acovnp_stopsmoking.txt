making progress

Hi all - I’m working on my 8th day smoke-free. 
I just turned 36 and had smoked since I was 16, so not quite 20 years. For most of that time, I averaged half a pack a day, but in the past year or so was down to around 6 a day. I had never seriously tried to quit before; I always told myself that I wouldn’t even attempt to quit until I was confident that I would be successful.

The first few days were surprisingly easy, but I was out of town and it was the holidays, so I wasn’t in my normal routine.

Day 5 was my first day back at work, and therefore back to the routine, and it started to become really difficult. The past few days have been super challenging. It’s hard to concentrate, and I am really irritable. Trying to power through. I do have Nicorette that I chew 2-3 times a day, when the cravings are the worst. Plus hard candy, normal gum, and I recently picked up some mint toothpicks as well. 

I’d love to hear others’ experiences, particularly about your quit timeline - what timeframes were the most difficult, and when did it start to feel easier? Really hoping this mental fog and irritability doesn’t last for several months...

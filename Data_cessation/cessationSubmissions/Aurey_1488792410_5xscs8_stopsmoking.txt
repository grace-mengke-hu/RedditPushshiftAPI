365 days smoke free -Best motivation right here

One year ago, after 10years of smoking and on my 32nd birthday, I quit.

One month ago I laid eyes on this guy : https://imgur.com/a/4yQlg

There is no better motivation I can think of and I want to be on this planet as long as possible to watch him grow up. Cheers to a smoke free life!

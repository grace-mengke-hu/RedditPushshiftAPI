I CAN'T STOP EATING.

Seriously. I can't fucking stop. 

I had my last cigarette at 6:30am on August 17th. I'm 5'6" and I shot up from 115 on the 17th to 127 this morning. I'm eating at least 3,000 calories a day. Even when I'm not hungry, I'm eating. I went to the movies with my friends and got a box of sour patch kids at the concession stand and I'd eaten them all before the movie started. I couldn't think of anything but food, food, food, food through the whole movie, I didn't even enjoy it.

Last night I bought a box of ice cream sandwiches and ate them all in a row.

Someone please help me, there has to be a way to beat this. I feel bloated and tired and miserable, my pants don't fit, I just want to go back to smoking so I can stop obsessing about food. Has anyone made it through this without buying a new wardrobe just to get through the first three weeks?

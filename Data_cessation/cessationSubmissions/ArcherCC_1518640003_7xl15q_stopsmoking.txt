Inadvertently quit smoking, not restarting

So I have wanted to quit for 6 or 7 years, always found an excuse not to, not gonna list them, we all know them. Found out back in December my wife is pregnant with number 2, swore I would be done before they are born.

Had no clue how I would go about quitting because frankly it has been part of my self identity since i was 18 (33 now), then 5 and a half days ago I got the flu. I was bed ridden for nearly 60 hours and still weak as a kitten now. 

The big thing was, I have had a lingering chest cold since October, add the flu and smoking in and during that 60 hours I felt as if I couldn't breath most the time. 

Fast foreward to Sunday when I could get out of bed and could have had a smoke, went down for one, lit it, hit it once and tossed it and the rest of the pack in the dumpster (yes it was out). Decided then and there that since my lungs were such shit and I had been almost 3 days without one I was done.

I need to be able to breath, I'm still dealing with a cough from the flu but I can't keep living like this.

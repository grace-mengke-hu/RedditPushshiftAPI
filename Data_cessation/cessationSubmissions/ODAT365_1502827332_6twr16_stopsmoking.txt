To keep it, you have to give it away

Self-sabotage would be an understatement if I were to smoke again. 

Please look after yourselves well, exercise, and troll through other comments on here daily. 

Other people's hope gives our minds strength, and we can help others on their quit, which in turn helps us on our own quit. 

To keep our quit strong, we must share our experience, strength and hope with others starting their quit. 

Keep it up!

11 days off, 26 years on.

Hey everybody, just recently found this sub and it's pretty damn inspiring. I found the first 9 days a breeze but the last 2 days have been rough with rage, cravings and mood swings increasing. I have been using a oral nicotine replacement spray. I was just wondering how weeks 2 and onward  have gone for you guys/girls ? Also will I ever get a good nights sleep again ? and to finish up, I have been thinking of becoming an occasional cigar smoker (not inhaling) to help in social situation like bars and parties, is this a really bad idea?

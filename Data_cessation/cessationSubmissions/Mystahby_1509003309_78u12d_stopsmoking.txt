Good Reminder

I had smoked for 7 years from 2009-2016. I quit last april after I had quit gambling. (yay) However, my father was recently diagnosed with cancer and I smoked a cigarette after I had shared the news with a coworker. I didn't enjoy it totally, but I did feel my lungs burn. In the time since I had quit, I developed chonic bronchitis (assuming its from the years of smoking and then quitting) when I lay down to sleep. That night I didn't cough like I normally did, but then a few days later I felt like I had a cold and it all came on at once. This time I had no fever or sore throat preceding it, just a lot of congestion. For the last 2 weeks I had been coughing like crazy whenever I laid down and had shallow breathing. I had coughed so much I strained an intercostal muscle and developed double pneumonia. Today I finally felt better. I don't know if I'm blowing things out of proportion, but I blame it all on the one cigarette... I'm staying quit now lol! Thanks for reading my rambling!

God damn these cravings are painful, any advice please??

22 days now and the cravings are just ridiculous! I'm gymming and running but for some reason my brain keeps saying 

'Look, how much better would your day be if you had a cigarette now!'

How did you people get over this? I used to really enjoy smoking and am finding it so hard now!

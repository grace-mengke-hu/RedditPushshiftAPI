265 days without smoking.

I am so close to my new years eve resolution of going the entirety of 2018 without smoking. Initially, I started 3 weeks prior, only to be peer pressured back into smoking. My friends I hung out with are good people. They never meant to pressure me, I just felt bad because it was our "ritual" to have a smoke every now and then when we hung out. I reaffirmed my desire to quit, and started, officially, on the 31st of December 2018. I had actually started a couple days prior, but that is of no importance. I just wanted to humble brag, and share my story. I was a smoker for 2+ years, started when I was 22. I knew I had to stop early on, but was too distracted by the urge to keep smoking. I smoked 1-2 packs a week. I know that's not as bad as most smokers, and I didn't want to progress to that level, hence why I decided to quit. Anyways, If there's anything i wish to tell others that are also wanting to stop, I would say "stay dedicated. It will be hard. It will be challenging. Remember why youre doing it."

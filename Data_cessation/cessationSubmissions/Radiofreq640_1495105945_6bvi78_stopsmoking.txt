Made it to day 5. Woo-hoo

I've been a smoker since I was about 13. I smoke 1.5 to 2 packs a day. I've tried numerous times to quit and never did. I finally found something that drives me to quit,Money. I started looking at where all my money goes and a giant chunk of it goes to cigarettes. I always figured it was a big chunk of money but I never really totalled it up. Anyways I got chantex, followed the instructions and quit. First few days were hell but day 4 seemed like I had more energy and I was starting to smell things a little better. I'm so glad my girlfriend put up with my crazy crabby butt for those couple of days. Very excited for my new life without cigarettes/nicotine.

I don't get it..

Why did I assume quitting would be so hard? Yes I will admit the first 3days were hell but since day4 the duration of the cravings have dropped to less than a minute of wasted thought and also it's not super intense anymore. 

Is this normal? I mean I'm only 10 or 11 days in, it can't be that easy?

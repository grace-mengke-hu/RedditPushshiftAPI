One Day Smoke Free

Hi!

I've been a smoker for the last 7-8 years of my life, approximately, smoking half a pack a day in the last 2-3 years.

Besides smoking, I live a pretty healthy lifestyle. But I know smoking its terrible for my health, even though I might not be seeing it yet. I'm really afraid of developing cancer later on in my life, and realizing I could have done something to prevent it.

I've tried to quit multiple times. Most of them half-assed, and I ended up buying a pack at the first craving. Some of them more serious, but I ended up succumbing anyway. Usually just thinking that one cigarette would do no harm and that it wouldn't mean I would be buying a pack. Which I ended up doing.

This time I really mean it. I've planned it in advance. I set my quit date for yesterday, and I stuck to it. I've been using an app on my phone that shows how much money I've saved, how many cigarette I've avoided, etc. I've written the reasons why I want to quit, and I've set contingency plans for what to do when the cravings come. I'm also on NRT (nicotine chewing gum).

I had my last cigarette 1 day and 30 minutes ago.

I just wanted to share here to have some sense of accountability :)  Wish me luck!

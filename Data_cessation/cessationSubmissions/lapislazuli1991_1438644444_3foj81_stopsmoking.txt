quitting today

it's been really hard. and i'm just like ahhhh. but every time i have a craving i go for a run or chew on a piece of nicotine gum. i tell myself that if i can get through the day without a single cigarette i win. and if i can go for 24 hours without a cigarette i can go for 48. i'm just not sure how much gum i should chew. i already had three pieces today. i'm trying to keep it down to four. so if i go to bed early, like at 9pm, i should be good. sorry for rambling. but i'm just so anxious about quitting. i really really want to quit.

Introduction

Hey everyone, 

Just wanted to introduce myself. My name is Jacob. My relationship with cigarettes is kind of complicated. I started smoking when I was 15. I smoked half a pack a day until I was 23, when I quit for two years. Stupidly, I started smoking again last year. But just recently I quit cold turkey. Haven't had a smoke since October 27th. I've started a blog about quitting smoking/staying healthy, something to keep me motivated to stay quit this time. 

So, yeah, just wanted to say hi and wish everyone good luck with their quits. We can do this!

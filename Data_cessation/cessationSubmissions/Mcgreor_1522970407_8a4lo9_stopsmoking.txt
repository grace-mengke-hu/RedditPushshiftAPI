Has anyone successfully quit cigarettes through JUUL, then quit the JUUL itself?

I recently got the JUUL and was successfully able to make the switch from smoking a pack a day with minimal cravings for cigarettes. But the reason it was so easy was because the JUUL pods have a lot of nicotine and a good throat hit similar to cigs. 
Now I'm completely hooked on the JUUL.
Has anyone successfully made the transition through JUUL and now doesn't smoke anything at all? Any tips? Thanks

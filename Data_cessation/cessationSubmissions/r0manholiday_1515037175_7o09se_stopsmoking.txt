[TW: Eating Disorder] When do the cravings stop?

I went cold turkey (my second attempt in the past year) 20 days ago and I really thought I'd feel better about it by now. At the moment, the only parts of quitting that I'm enjoying are that my clothes don't stink of smoke and that I'm saving money.

I'm having a major issue with cravings. I don't seem to get separate cravings, I sort of have one constant craving that's like an annoying voice at the back of my head going 'I want to smoke I want to smoke I want to smoke' and I can't get it to stop. I've tried things like nicotine gum but they don't really help, I think my brain is missing the routine of going outside and actually smoking, as well as the nicotine itself.

I don't think it helps that I used to use smoking as a way to suppress hunger when my eating disorder was really bad. It tends to bother me around Christmas because people typically eat more than usual; I know that I've put on weight during Christmas so now I feel guilty about eating in general and want to replace eating when I'm hungry with smoking when I'm hungry. 

Does anyone have any ways of controlling the cravings? It's kind of driving me nuts.

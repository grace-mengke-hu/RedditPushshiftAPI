Had powerful cravings today. I proved to be stronger! :D

Man that wasn't easy at all. Fortunately, this was just day 2 and it's normal for it to be hard right now, I expect it to get easier. I am really done with smoking now, so I will continue no matter what. My secret weapon is exercise. If the craving is strong, I just go walking, and running when no one can see me. Get the blood flowing, and the feel-good chemicals getting released. And reinforcing the idea that I am an athlete, not a suicidal person (wanting to kill himself with cigarettes).

Looking forward to seeing my lungs heal and my health and fitness go through the roof as I am simultaneously exercising a lot, improving my diet, relaxing to deal with stress, sleeping better, and losing weight.

Funk Checking in, all is well. 77 Days, 1111 Smokes not smoked. $355.00US re appropriated.

Howdy, 



Title, + its easy. Don't be scared to try kids, the patch worked like a charm for me, and I only needed step 2 and 1/2 of step 3.



I am a 37 yo dude, and my muscles are liking this new found circulation. It feels like there is blood getting to places it hasn't gotten to since I was 15, and I have noticed some visual changes in my body, especially the guns. Its radical, and totally tubular. 



Wang; it has turbo mode now, also tubular, but meaty. 




I can drink delicious beers and not freak. I did on day 2 actually. I was really fearing that part, but I just had to get my mind right. That sounds so lame, but it is the truth. Want to quit, think of the the benefits, and know you are giving up nothing. Everyday feels like an upgrade to a character that I actually am. 



Also.....ladies; Turbo Wang.

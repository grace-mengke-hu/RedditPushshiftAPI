Hello again

I'm feeling kinda down. I quit smoking and drinking Jan 1st and I'm so happy with my progress, but I've found myself gone nocturnal. I am so exhausted after work I lay down in the afternoon and sleep till 1030-11p. Then I can't fall back asleep till 4-5a (wake at 6). Anyone else experience insomnia or turning into a raccoon?

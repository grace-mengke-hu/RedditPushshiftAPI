I need advice!

I smoke cigarettes and use dip tobacco. I'm trying to quit both. The hardest part is cigarettes. I would like to quit both, but I don't know what to do to help my situation. 
I started smoking when I was 14 years old, and I started dipping a little while after that. If anyone has any advice on quitting both it would be appreciated. I've been doing this for around 8 years, and since I am almost 23 I need to quit!

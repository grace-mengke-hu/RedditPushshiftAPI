4 days smoke free. Things are starting to even out!

Had my last smoke 4 days ago. I'm starting to feel good. I didn't think about cigarettes until about 45 minutes after waking up today; and even then it wasn't a craving, it was more like "Woah, I haven't though of cigarettes today!" I've been using the 2mg nicotine lozenges to help with my worst cravings. Whenever I was going to crack I'd say "Take on of the lozenges, and if you still want to smoke in 20 minutes go for it." The craving would subside, I'd get occupied by something else and forget. Rinse / repeat. 4 days in and I haven't had a lozenge yet today, and I have only the mildest craving!

Super excited to start feeling better. Once I feel fine I'm going to need to do something about this 5lbs I've put on in the past 4 days :)

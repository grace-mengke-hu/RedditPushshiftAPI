Sometimes it's too much...

Such an awful addition... :( I'm almost 3 months free and the last days were an absolute nightmare. It's not that I want the cig it's just that feeling of not knowing who I am without it. I don't know if I'm sad if I'm angry... oh! And I've dream I was smoking the last 2 nights. Anyone can relate?? I don't want to give up but it was easier one week ago and I thought it would be easier by now...

Smoker for 2 years - can't do it. Note to 'social smokers'

I started smoking just around two years ago. From mere social smoker to around  15 a day - road to a packet. I just can't take the guilt of having my first cigarette at a mature age of 20. Recently I've waken up with my body stiff, not processing enough oxygen throughout the night and I am concerned about my well being. I can't do it any more. I've been lerking around these forums for a few weeks and have quit two days ago. My motivation levels are high, I wouldn't smoke if someone paid me $1000 bucks. I just need to make sure my willpower is consistent throughout this process.

I think the position I was in is nearing to a packet a day smoker from a social smoker. Most my social groups are smokers and they tend not to be disconcerned about smokers. So the emvionment made it easier for this habit to take place. Take it from me. There is no such thing as a social smoker. I'd take two or three smokes from my mate during a day out - realizing that I'd want to hang out with them to a smoke. Then buying a packet felt so easy after a few times. The friends who would advice me not to smoke had given up and all I was left with was a packet of smokes and a lighter. It was not worth.
 
I haven't experienced a habit that needs to be removed in my life before. I hope this experience will teach me a few things about life and make me a stronger man. I know it's making you guys stringers. If a full time smoker can quit, he can do anything. 

I would like to congratulate everyone who is on the road to quitting and I severely wish you all the best. 

Thank you for an amazing medium and hopefully be more helpful on my journey.

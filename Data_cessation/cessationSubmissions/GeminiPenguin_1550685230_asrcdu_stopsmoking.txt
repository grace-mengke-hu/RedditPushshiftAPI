Nicotine Gum Question

Hey all! I quit using the gum and I'm still using it. It's almost time for me to start cutting to the second part of the program. Right now since the program says I can have it every 1-2 hours I've been having it whenever I want it. Some days I have more and other days I have less. With the second part (Week 7-9) I'm supposed to cut down to one piece every 2-4 hours. Has anyone quit smoking and quit using the gum ? I ask, because I know so many people who use it like years later. Do you have any tips on cutting down on the gum? I know the gum is healthier than smoking, but I don't want to be on it forever, either.

I need help

I've seen some tips on here and I've heard some advice from other people but I can never get myself to follow the advice given. I was wondering if anyone had any other not so common tips or tricks that helped them quit. The end of the month marks one year of my addiction but I'm already smoking a pack a day, sometimes more and it's worse when I drink or smoke weed. I'm looking for anything to help me quit no matter how silly or outrageous it might be. Thank you for your time

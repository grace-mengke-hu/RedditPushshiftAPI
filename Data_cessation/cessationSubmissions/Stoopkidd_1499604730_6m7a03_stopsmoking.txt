My 1 year.

On July 9th, 2016, exactly 1 year ago today,  I decided to put down the pack and strive towards a healthier way of living. I had tried quitting numerous times in the past, but this time was a little different. I had the drive. Although I'm only 26, after 9 years of smoking, I felt like I had to make the change now, at that moment.

Since quitting, I have picked up a more regular work out routine, ran my first 5k and rid my car of the tortuous smell. I still have a craving now and then, but nothing crazier than wanting a chocolate bar or something. 

For those of you deciding to quit, stick with it. It gets harder, but it definitely gets easier after a few weeks. After a few months go by, you'll wear that "non-smoker badge" with honor and wonder why you ever started in the first place. Life is better than a smoke.

Best of luck to all. I'm going to celebrate my one year with a pack of Camels (Just kidding ðŸ˜€).

Cheers!

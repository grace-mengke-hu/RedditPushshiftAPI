I have started developping a smoking habit. What is the best way to nip it in the bud?

Title sums it up.

For the past ~3 months I have been having a couple cigarettes a day. I can already feel that I'm working my way up to more (3-5 a day) and I'm not sure if I should just quit cold turkey, or if I should invest in patches/gum/a vaporiser. On Sunday I decided to stop, but I only made it till today, which was kind of my 'wake up call' and showed my I was addicted.

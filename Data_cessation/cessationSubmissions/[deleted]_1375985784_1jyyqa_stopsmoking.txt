Day one.

Well, I've been thinking about this for a while. I figure it's now or never. I thought since I'm pretty serious about this, and have been working myself up to it for a little while now, I would just give a first hand account of what it feels like to be ready to quit. 

I began smoking about 3 years ago. It started at parties, while drinking. A bunch of my friends would smoke, they would offer me a puff, and I would take one. I liked the head rush that it would give me. I didn't really like the taste, but I didn't find it completely repulsive either. I guess I just liked the feeling of relaxation it gave me. 

Fast forward 3 years, and I'm a textbook closet smoker. My girlfriend hates smoking, so I hide it from her. She has occasionally discovered me smoking, but I managed to convince her that they were just relapses and that I had really "quit". In reality, I had never stopped smoking. It is damaging our relationship, and damaging my health. Half of the time, I'm paranoid that she will find out I'm smoking, and the other half I'm feeling grossed out by the habit. In addition, I'm so lethargic most of the time that I barely want to do anything active, and so I'm getting out of shape quickly.

So, I've read Allan Carr's book (and the general gist of it has helped), and am now watching Joel Spitzer's videos on youtube. It's now been about 21 hours since my last cigarette. I'm excited to break through the physical withdrawal in a few days, but I'm much more excited to learn to control my behaviour and replace my bad habits with good habits, so I can live the type of life I want to live, and be the type of person I want to be.

Wish me luck!

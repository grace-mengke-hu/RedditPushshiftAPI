It's been my 9th day and I am just struggling with a very bad craving. Please, help.

I quit smoking 9 days ago and I felt very determined. Right now I feel down and depressed and missing a cigarette. It's driving me crazy and I can't stop thinking about lighting a cigarette and just sit outside and relax. What should I do?

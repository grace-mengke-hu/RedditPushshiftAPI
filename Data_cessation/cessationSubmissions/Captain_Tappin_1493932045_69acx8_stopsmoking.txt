21M heavy smoker

Hi r/stopsmoking, Tuesday I decided to quit smoking and I couldn't make it 6 hours. 

Some background, I started smoking first year of University when midterms hit, it was only a few a week but I started working in an environment where smoking on the job is common and my habit started to pick up to where three years (coming up on 4) I'm at almost a pack+ a day.

What really motivated me to quit was visiting my best friend and seeing how the smell alone could cause her to have an allergic reaction, it made me realize I'm hurting myself and the people I love. I just discovered this sub and am really hoping that some other creatures of habit out there who were able to quit could share some wise words of wisdom.

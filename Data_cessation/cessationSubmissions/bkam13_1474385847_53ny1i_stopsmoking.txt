Day 2 smoke free

Well it's my second day of not smoking and I'm still a bit sick. Mostly sinus issues and coughing today though. This is strange because the last time I quit smoking, I experienced the same symptoms. Maybe that's how my body decides to freak out is by giving me a cold, instead of super anxiety.

Day 2 smoke free and I don't plan to look back.

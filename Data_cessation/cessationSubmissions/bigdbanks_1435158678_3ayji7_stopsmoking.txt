First day smoke free!

Had my last cigarette of Monday night at the pub and conveniently ran out. I bought another 20 pack yesterday morning without even thinking but I seemed to be in a really good mood so I taped the pack up with loads and loads of selotape and haven't touched them so far. I keep them on me but without a lighter. I also poked a few holes in the bottom of the pack and when I have a craving I smell them for a bit instead of smoking because I'm too lazy to get through the tape and too tight to buy another pack when I have one. I knew my laziness would come in handy one day! Anyway here is to 1 day smoke free, and hopefully many more to come... no definitely many more to come!!!!

Today sucks balls

Day 28 and I want to go buy a pack more than ever. When do these fucking cravings stop? I feel like a crazy person. I am so irritable. I ruined a good night with my girlfriend last night because I couldn't think straight and I fear I have no personality now. No way to break up my stress. What the fuck.

Another thing... another fear... what if this is just how I am now? What if instead of going outside and cooling off and having at least SOME satisfaction when I get stressed, I just freak out in my head now and shut down? I think this is how I was before I started smoking. It feels familiar to me.

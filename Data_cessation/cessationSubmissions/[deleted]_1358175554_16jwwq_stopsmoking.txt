so much more energy

I quit cold turkey new years day and the cravings have not been nearly as bad as the previous times i tried to quit with the e-cig and the patch. I have set myself a goal to run a half marathon in May. I know that smoking even one cigarette will be a huge set back and i think that is keeping me motivated.

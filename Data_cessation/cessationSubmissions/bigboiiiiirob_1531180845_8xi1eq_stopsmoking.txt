Trouble quitting due to social drinking

I have been smoking for about 11 years now and while it used to be an every day thing, I have no issue not smoking Sunday through Thursday, but on Friday and Saturday once I start drinking I am helpless, all I do is crave a cigarette and will go through a pack a night while drinking. Obviously the logical solution is to stop drinking, but I’m in my late 20s and the social part of drinking is the main reason I do it, I’m not an alcoholic.



Does anyone have any advice on how you were able to get through this?

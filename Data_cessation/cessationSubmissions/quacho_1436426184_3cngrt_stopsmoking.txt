Tiredness and drowsiness after quitting. Is it normal?

Light smoker for 4 years. Smoked 1-2 cigarettes a day. Quit 15 days ago. Feeling extreme fatigue and drowsiness to the point that I can't function. Has anyone experienced the same? How long does it last? Don't know if I should see a doc or wait till it gets better..

5 months pregnant and I'm so embarrassed

Tomorrows the day! Finals are today and I will quit tomorrow, I swear I will, I can, I'm going to. I am 5 months pregnant and I feel just aweful about smoking, people stare, my own guilt...its terrible. It kind of feels like if I don't have the morning smoke, or the after dinner one, or the just got home one, I'm going to miss out on somthing, like I'm going to miss smoking or something. 
The worst part is that my husband wants to quit too but it seems like he has even less drive to do it than I. Its a back and fourth... But TOMORROW IS THE DAY! Day one... Let's do this !!!!

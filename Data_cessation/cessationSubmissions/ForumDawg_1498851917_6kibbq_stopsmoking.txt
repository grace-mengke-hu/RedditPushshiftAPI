100 days. Successful vape-quit, down to 0mg!

Hi all, 

Just a quick follow up. I have spent the last 100 days vaping to quit smoking. I have been steadily diluting the nicotine strength of the liquid I am consuming. I started at 18mg/ml and was consuming about 6ml/day. My last dilution was 0.125mg/ml and last week I was consuming about 1ml/day. Today I have dropped to 0mg/ml. Last week I found myself spending whole days not vaping at all, leaving the house without my vape, and just generally not craving nicotine for long stretches. This is just an anecdotal report to say that weaning yourself off nicotine can work.

Good luck to any of you just getting started. I'll report back in another 100 days.

Getting rid of cigarette smoke in the car?

So I’m not sure this is the best place to post this, but I’m really annoyed with how my car smells from over 3 years of smoking. I didn’t have an ashtray in it (dick move because of flaming litter) and would clean it regularly about every 2 months with a vacuum and Armor cleaners.

It still smells like smoke, and I know there’s no complete way to get rid of it, only to reduce the smell to a minimum. I’ve looked at many posts about using Ozium, coffee grinds, citrus peels, baking soda, vinegar, etc. but wanted to hear more opinions.

I’m hoping that someone with the experience of cigarette smells could lead me in the right way. I just want a nice smelling car, and can use an air freshener to cover what little smell is left from a deep clean. Of course, I’d like to do it by myself, but if it doesn’t work I can just go to a local detail shop for professional help (with an ozone pump/treatment). But I’d like to avoid that for financial reasons.

Any help or links is highly appreciated. I’ll delete this post if this isn’t the right community to post in. Thanks.

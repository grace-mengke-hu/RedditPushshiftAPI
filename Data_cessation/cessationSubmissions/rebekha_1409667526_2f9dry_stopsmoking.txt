I will be 1000 days quit in a couple of weeks - how to celebrate?

I quit on the 21st December 2011 and I've just been informed by my stopsmoking subreddit flair that I am nearly at the 1000 days point.  What should I do to mark this occasion? Purely by coincidence, I will be on holiday at the time! :)

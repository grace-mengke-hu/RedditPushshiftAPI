Best way to quit- Get your tonsils removed!

It's been 4 days now and it really wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I should have quit years ago. Not sure how I'll cope when my throat is better though. Anyway I've been lurking in this sub for a while and seeing all your posts really pushed me to finally stop. So thanks.

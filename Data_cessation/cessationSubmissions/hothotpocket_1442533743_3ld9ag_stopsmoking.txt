2 tips for kicking the habit that worked for me

I tried a while back and could lose the habit. I found the best way is to drop your current social circle that encourages it.. If that means moving town or changing jobs then so be it. 
And secondly whenever there are cravings to tell yourself you have the power to have it at any time. I can have it next month, next weekend,  if I really wanted to. But I can wait for now. 

I honestly thought I would feel more excited about not smoking but strangely I don't?   I now can be around friends that smoke and not have any urges. 

Look forward to a clear head and unbound creativity.

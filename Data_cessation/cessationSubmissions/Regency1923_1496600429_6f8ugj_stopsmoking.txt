Going to try again

So yesterday didn't go as good as planned but plan to try it again this time with the patch and this time also I have stuff to keep my mind busy.  1 being embroidery and 2 just overall things to do including I decide to start dieting and brush off my old religion.  Towards my religion, I've always had a few twinges to go back and normally just ignored them but lately they've been stronger so what's 1 little trip to church going to hurt?  Especially to us Catholics, church is kinda important.

Besides that my embroidery will keep me busy, it can be frustrating lol with the cross stitches and french knots and all that. 

If this stuff don't keep me busy I don't know what will.

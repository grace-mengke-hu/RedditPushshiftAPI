I'm on the verge of smoking again

Just wanted to tell you guys something...

...So I have been to my doctor, and he's told me that I can't do sports again. No skating, no dancing, no parcour. To know this has sparked my interest in smoking again. Since I can't do shit to stay fit, I might aswell just start smoking again. 

I don't know how to handle all this. 

Edit:

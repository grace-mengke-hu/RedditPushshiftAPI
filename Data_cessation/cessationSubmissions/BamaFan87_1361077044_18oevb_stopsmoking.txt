500 day milestone!

Yesterday was my 500-day anniversary of the last cigarette ever smoked! I owe it mostly to Allen Carr's Easyway to Stop Smoking seminar video. Along with tea tree oil chewing sticks I made it through the first 21 days and after then was smooth sailing, I am still plagued by the occasional nightmare of smoking in my dreams. Upon awaking from these unfortunate dreams I am very angry at myself for ruining everything I have worked for but then rejoice after the realization of having only smoked in my dreams. These dreams are truthfully the only time smoking ever crosses my mind. The urge to smoke is non-existent. There is hope for all the early quitters, it is truly much easier than you may be bullying yourself into believing. Keep on keeping on everyone. 

Edit: Grammar, fixed the ones I caught, there are probably more, oh well.

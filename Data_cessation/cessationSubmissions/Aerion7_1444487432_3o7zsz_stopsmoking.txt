Cutting back to quit

This week I have significantly reduced my cigarette intake. I previously smoked maybe 10-15 cigs a day. Now I'm down to about 3. I actually feel a little more energetic now. The first few days of smoking the reduced amount were rough. I felt emotional and jittery. I think I am now acclimated to the smaller amount and will quit in the next week. Has anybody else had success with tapering off before quitting?

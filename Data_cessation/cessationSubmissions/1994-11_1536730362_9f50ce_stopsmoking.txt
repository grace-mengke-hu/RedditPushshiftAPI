Quitting Tips?

I’ve smoked for about 10 years now. At my most I was up to a pack every two days. I’ve cut down to about 1 cig per day but I’m having a hard time getting over the hump to none. Any tips or thoughts on how to stop completely? I definitely have wrapped my identity around being a “smoker” and I’m not sure how to shed that. I follow this sub to get inspiration and I figured why not interact! Seriously any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

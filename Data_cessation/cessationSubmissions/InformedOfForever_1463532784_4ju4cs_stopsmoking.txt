Day 50!

This is the longest I've ever gone without smoking since I took it up in high school ten years ago.

I owe most of my luck to my own willingness to keep going, though I think this time my continuous checking of the Smoke Free app on my phone, plus reading Allen Carr's Easyway method did wonders.

If you're struggling to get over those first few days, or have been going for a while and are ready to crack, I suggest trying one or both of those methods, cause it could really help a lot.

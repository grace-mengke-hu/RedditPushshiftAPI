Wanna quit but not cold turkey!!

I already suffer from clinical depression. If i stop smoking at once, i feel like killing myself with all the withdrawal symptoms. Nicotine keeps me calm no doubt about that. 

I have been reading a lot about e-cigrattes and that they are safe. Is it true? Can anyone who is using e cig for a long time help?

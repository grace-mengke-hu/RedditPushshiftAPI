Close to quitting

Hey guys, I’ve been trying to quit recently and use a vape with 35mg while trying to minimize my usage as much as possible. I recognized that I get cravings after I finish a meal or just when my brain feels mentally tired after a long day. I know that it’s all in my head etc. and theres really not much advice to get but i just wanted to put this here and get it out of my system. I feel like im super close to quitting but I just get these big cravings sometimes, like a bunch of tension i can feel it. I was thinking of embracing the tension but I lowkey just want to take some hits right now

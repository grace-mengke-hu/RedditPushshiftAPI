Rage Stage

I finally decided to quick smoking after relying on it heavily to deal with any kind of stress for the last eight years. I’m three days in and I feel like a ticking time bomb; I punched my kettle earlier because I burnt my hand on the steam. I’m usually very placid in regards to getting angry, I feel so out of sorts. In your guys experience, how long did it take for this to pass?

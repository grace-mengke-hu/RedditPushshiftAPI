10 Days Smoke Free

I can't believe it! I've been smoking at least a pack a day since I was 14 years old. I'm 25 now. On my birthday this year, I told myself I would stop with this terrible habbit. And I'm writing this, actually succeeding. No patch,  no gum, no vape. Just cold turkey. And I am so proud of myself. The stories I've read on this sub have helped me immensely! Thank you all so much. And to all of you that aren't quite there yet. You can do this. We have it within ourselfs to cut this shit out of our lives. I'm so excited to be able to hug my parents without subjecting them to the scent of my self destruction.

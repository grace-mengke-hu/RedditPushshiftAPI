The double quit

wow, 42 days, never thought it possible. I feel great, I can breathe and I have more energy.

However...

I have always been a drinker, even before I was of legal age. My friends and I would always make sure we had beer or liquor or anything that would get us drunk for friday and saturday night...every week. 

This continued into my adult life as well. However, I don't get blackout drunk anymore, I just like having 5 or so beers every night. I managed to disassociate drinking and smoking when I quit smoking. But now, I am noticing that I am drinking more(because I dont get as hungover without smoking).

I have decided to stop drinking as well and cleanse out my body completely. I have requested a badge over at /r/stopdrinking and will put in just as much effort with that as I have with smoking. 

Here's too a cleaner me!

Didn't think it could be so bad after 2 weeks

Damn it, I'm still holding out but it's like the first easy 2 weeks have come back to take their toll, with interest. I've been riding cravings all day since last night, sometimes every 5 minutes, sometimes only every 15 or so. 

Been shopping this morning and even though before this I never even thought about it, today I had to concentrate on physically not letting my feet stop at the tobacco shop on the way to the market. It also helped that I saw a guy passing me by with cigarette in hand and I thought: "that could be you if you stop now". 

But damn, I'd still like to just hop on down there and buy a pack, even though I barely ever experienced this feel of wanting during the 1st two weeks. 

I guess this is at once a plea for help and a reminder to myself why I'm spending today in agony of wanting to light up, just when I thought it only gets easier. At least I could stay strong and get half a dozen packs of crackers instead of that one pack. Never again do I want to resign to spending my life smoking pack after pack. I will not falter.

Quitting for my future children.

My husband and I agreed to quit smoking because we want to have children soon. Yesterday we had our last cigarettes. 

It's been 20 hours. 

I've cried and sobbed. 

I've had a migraine for hours. 

I barely slept. 

But it's worth it. I bought myself [these little newborn slippers](http://m.target.com/p/just-one-you-made-by-carter-s-baby-boys-puppy-bootie-slipper-gray-nb/-/A-49166897) to stay motivated. 

What keeps you motivated?

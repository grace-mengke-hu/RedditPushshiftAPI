more than one week smoke free

I have no physical withdrawals, which makes it fairly easy for me to quit.

Tougher are social situations. Last week, during a BBQ with friends, one of whom smokes. Temptation was fairly low ( I dont like his brand of cigarettes haha) 

The weekend was a bit tougher, doing stuff with 2 regular smoker. After not giving in during the first 2 smoke breaks (which wasnt easy, as I was hungry for a cig ) it got easier and I stayed my course.


So far so good.

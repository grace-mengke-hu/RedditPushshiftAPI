Canker sores

Hey everyone, I’ve been smoking since I was 19 (I’ll be 22 in less than a month) and I’m finally ready to call it quits. I got myself a juul (even though coincidentally it was actually vapes that led to cigarettes in my case) and cut out the cigs. I don’t have any cravings for cigarettes so that’s good. HOWEVER THESE FUCKING CANKER SORES ARE KILLING ME. I just got my first round of canker sores but from previous experience with going days without cigarettes, I know there will be more immediately after these ones go away. How long can I expect to have to deal with these reoccurring canker sores until they finally stop coming back? Because honestly, cigarettes are better than having to deal with the constant pain of multiple canker sores. But I’m willing to power through it. So how long until my body recalibrates and I stop getting canker sores? 1 week? 4 weeks? 6 months? Or am I in this for life??

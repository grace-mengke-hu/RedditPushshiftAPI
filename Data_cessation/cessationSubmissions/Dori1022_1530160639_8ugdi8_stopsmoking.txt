I have to but can’t seem to do it

I’m new here.  I’m desperate to quit and I just can’t.  I keep telling myself that all I have to do is not buy them .  Then next thing I know I am buying them. Everything is a trigger— driving, waking up, eating, boredom, stress, anxiety, anger. I want to do chantix but I’m a non smoker on my health insurance so I can’t have it on my record or insurance and I can’t afford it without.  A friend gave me a Month.  I made it a week without smoking and foolishly went back.  Life is extremely stressful right now with pressures coming from all sides.  Smoking relaxes me and reduces my anxiety.  As soon as I say I’ll quit something happens and throws me for a loop and I give it up.  Sometimes it’s only an hour later.  I’m hoping that doing something different like using this sub along with an app will help me.  I think I’m going to be posting a lot.

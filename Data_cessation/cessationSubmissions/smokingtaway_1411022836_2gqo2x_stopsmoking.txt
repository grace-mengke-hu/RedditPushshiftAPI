I need help

I started smoking about 4 years ago. My boyfriend(ex) was a smoker and that's how I even got into the whole smoking thing. We broke up a year ago and since then I've been trying really hard to quit. I'm all alone in this battle and I really need help. Please, please help me. I don't know how to stop all of a sudden. Please help me, someone, please help me. I'm so desperate right now.. I don't have anyone I can talk to. How do I stop smoking? I've read books, I've read blogs, I've done everything. I dunno what else to do. I went cold turkey for almost a month, but that's the best I could do. If anyone is kind enough to help me, please, please, help me.

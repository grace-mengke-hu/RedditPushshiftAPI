easyway to quit smoking, need help.

I have read the book and watched the video several times, still i give in somehow everytime i try. This is making me really hate myself pretty bad. Once i did quit for about 40 days and then relapsed. I have been smoking since 5 years and its taken a toll on my health, my stamina is close to zero, Iam lethargic all the time I just want all this to stop, can you guys suggest methods you used to continue your quit.

After 10 days I'm not even tempted anymore!

Tried to quit, numerous times, smoked for 15 years. Mostly tobacco as it is cheaper, slightly better for you and taste far better IMO. 
Haven't had a sober cigarette on 10 days now!

And haven't had a drink in 3. So no intoxicated fag since Sunday. Fags was step one, alcohol step 2. 

I will not drink or smoke today!

Stay strong!

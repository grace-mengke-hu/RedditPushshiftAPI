Quitting moking/moles/chops?

Anyone else doing this/has done this? Any tips or experiences? I have a viral infection on the left side of my throat that enlarged my lymph node(according to urgentcare. i have an ENT apptmt tomorrow so hopefully I haven't really messed up) and made me not wanna smoke tobacco ever again.

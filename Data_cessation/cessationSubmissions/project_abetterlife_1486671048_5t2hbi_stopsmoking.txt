Still free. Have to learn to deal with anxiety now that I choose not to choke it. I will stay free :)

I am looking forward to reaching 2 months. 

Also, this is one of those things not so commonly listed under "evils of smoking": I now actually have to learn how to deal with anxiety as apparently I haven't learned before. 

I still have cravings. I choose to stay free. One thing that is helping me is knowing the number of days, and telling myself "let's just reach <next milestone>" :)

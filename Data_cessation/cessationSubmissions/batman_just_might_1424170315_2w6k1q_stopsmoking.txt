1 year without smoking.

I started smoking at 15 and decided to stop smoking at 25. This year I'll be 33. I tried every single recipe or method that was known and I failed miserably several times. This is what worked for me:

- Champix. I didn't have any bad reaction from it what so ever. I didn't even stop smoking at first. I just had the medicine until I didn't feel like smoking anymore (maybe 3 weeks in)
- After I quit smoking, I would keep going out to smoke with my friends from work, but just not smoke. It sounds silly but this helped a lot for me.

If you guys have any questions, shoot. I'll try to answer as much as I can.

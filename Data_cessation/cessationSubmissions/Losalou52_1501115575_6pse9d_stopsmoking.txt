14,000

**cigarettes that I have not smoked!**

Today marks 700 days since I quit.  I was smoking a pack a day for many years.  At a modest $5 per pack assumption, I have saved at least $3500 and forgone over 14,000 cigarettes.  I just had my first child a few months ago and am so proud that she will never know me as a smoker and that I will be happier, healthier, and wealthier for it.

I did it.  So can you!

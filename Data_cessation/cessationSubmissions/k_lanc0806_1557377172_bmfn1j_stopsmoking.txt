I had my first smoking dream

Been without for 2 months. And I miss it. Was on a tire in my driveway (which should have been a giveaway that it wasn’t real life). And decided to smoke just one. 

It was both so nice to smoke a cig, and so sad that i has broken my two month streak. 

Woke up to find it had just been a dream. Kinda of pissed at my subconscious that I hadn’t realized I’d been dreaming. I could have enjoyed that one with no negative consequences. 

But oh well, at least I haven’t actually broken my streak.

How to get out of the *uck it attitude

I've been trying to quit for months now. I am asking for advice on how to get out of the screw it attitude that always leads me to buying a pack. For example, my thought process is just like screw it, you're going to want the cig, what's the harm. You'll quit one day. I met a girl who, thinks I only vape. I'm still smoking and I think I really want to NOT ruin it with her. So I have to come and be honest with myself and go through with the plan. I also don't really want to vape. I'm at 9mg with the vape and I am hitting this thing like a madman because it just isn't the same. I think I will really use her as motivation as things get more serious (early dating stages) I want to do it for myself, ultimately, but I need advice on what your thought process is during the beginning. Should I just ditch the vape? It just really keeps me as an addict.

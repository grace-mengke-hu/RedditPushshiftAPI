13 days! It kind of crept up on me!

I didn't realize until I looked at my flair today that I have made it almost two weeks! I owe this success initially to Chantix, but after that I totally give my brain credit. It just got easier each day until I forgot that it was ever a big deal! Stoked! I watched a special about the tobacco trade today and didn't even writhe around in agony! Cheers everyone!

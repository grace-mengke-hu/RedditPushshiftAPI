I got back to smoking and don't know how to quit again

So as the title says...i've started smoking again the past 3-4 months and i just wanna quit again. I managed to stay free of smoking for 2 years...and one drunken night it was all it took...started with some weed...then a cigg after...then a pack...and that was it.

I just wanna try again but i'm at a very low point in my life and i'm severely depressed and i'm afraid that i'll just go nuts the first week or two. I remember the first time i quit cold turkey the first week i couldn't handle myself, i was angry all the time and couldn't restrain myself, i pissed off alot of people that week. I don't wanna go throught that anymore but i have to try.

Anyone have any tips? Not involving eating other stuff to stop smmoking because i'm already fat as it is :D

Today is the day

I'm giving it a go today.  Quitting smoking after 15 years.  I have my Chantix.  Wish me luck. 

It was hard today but not one cigarette.  Several cravings.  But I'm doing this and appreciate the support here.  Every time it had a craving I came to stopsmoking and read and got distracted and encouraged not to give up.   Looking forward to posting Day 2....

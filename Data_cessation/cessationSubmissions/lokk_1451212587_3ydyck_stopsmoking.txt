First cravings one month in :|

Is this normal at all? After getting through the first 3 days or so, I've been really good and haven't desired a single cigarette. However, all day today I've been thinking about smoking. Anyone else run into this? I thought after making it 3 weeks in, things would be easier, not randomly harder.

Anyways, just wanted to share my thoughts. Trying hard not to give in today.

Shortness of breath after quitting

Hi everyone! So I just reached the 2 week mark (can I get a 'Hell yeah'?), but the last couple of days I've experienced the kind of burning sensation in my lungs and shortness of breath I would normally have associated with, well, having smoked. My fianc√©e suggests it's nothing to worry about and most likely a sign that my lungs are cleaning themselves, causing them to 'work harder' and be more sensitive to dust and contamination.

Should I be worried and maybe go to a doctor, or is this normal? 

Thanks in advance for your responses!

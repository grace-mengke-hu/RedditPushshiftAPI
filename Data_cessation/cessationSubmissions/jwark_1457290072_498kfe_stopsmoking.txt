at 64 hours and having a really hard time, scared

I'm getting blood pressure spikes that are scary, almost have made a trip to the ER a few times. Body feeling flushed out, ringing in ears, numbness in lips, feet, tongue. Feel like I'm dying. Is this normal? If anyone experienced this how long does it take to go away?

Day 35, and the cravings are increasing.

Hi all.
Quick question: did anyone else experience a substantial increase of the physical discomfort well over a month after quitting (cold turkey)? I'm on day 35, and even if the first three weeks or so went by like a breeze, in the last two weeks I've been fighting progressively stronger and longer cravings, without any apparent triggers. Anyone experienced something similar and managed to successfully suppress the nicotine demon?

TIA

(Edit: for context, I've been smoking a pack/day for almost twenty years)

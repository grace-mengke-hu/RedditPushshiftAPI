Trying again

About a year and a half ago, I quit for about 3 months. Everything was going well, but then at a holiday party I stepped outside with my wife just to chat while she had a cigarette. Well, I had one too and the slippery slope continued from there. This morning I decided I'm going to try again. Wish me luck!

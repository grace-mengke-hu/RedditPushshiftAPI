Tips for quitting with autism?

I have autism and even though I am on the lower end of the spectrum, routine is a huge part of my day. Any tips for setting a new routine when I feel like I am literally dying because my routine is messed up? I can't do patches or the pill because I have an allergy to nicotine (started when I was a teen and didn't give a damn) and my therapist has denied the pill. Any tips or suggestions? Thanks!

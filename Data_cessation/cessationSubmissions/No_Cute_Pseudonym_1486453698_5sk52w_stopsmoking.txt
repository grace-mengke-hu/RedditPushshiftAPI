This Is It. Period.

I've been a smoker for 23 years now, and I've had enough. I've quit before, sure - for a few days, a few weeks, even a whole year once - but this is the absolute end of the road for my relationship with Messrs. Phillip Morris and R. J. Reynolds.

 

My last effort was going well enough, until my wife - with the noblest of intentions - bought me a pack of my favorite American Spirits after a particularly rough day. She isn't a smoker, she doesn't quite get it. I need the support of a group of my fellow quitters. I need *you,* r/stopsmoking, to help me hold myself accountable.

 

I'm in recovery from a seriously nasty bout of the flu, and after a few days in bed/on the couch thought I'd treat myself to a single smoke. And you know what? It was fucking awful. I threw out the pack, bought a bag of Life Savers Wint-O-Green mints as a substitute for when the *real* nic fits strike, and have set myself some milestones with concrete rewards for reaching them.

 

Thanks for reading. I'm ready to change my life.

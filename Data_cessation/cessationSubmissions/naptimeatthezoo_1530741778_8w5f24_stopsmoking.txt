In-the-moment tip for when a craving hits

Alright, so I'm currently just dabbling in non-smoking (haven't had one in four days so it's going pretty well), but I've stumbled upon a little technique for when I suddenly wish I had one: 

When the desire to smoke arises, I immediately think, "This is a feeling of wanting something and not having it. It's a normal feeling." And I just sort of sit with it, and sometimes I think of other things I want or have wanted in recent memory, from big and emotionally heavy stuff to other small cravings that did not result in getting what I wanted. 

I find something comforting about thinking of this thing I'm not having right now being part of a larger picture in which not every urge gets satisfied all the time. I've been known to give smoking some sort of special classification as something that I need to do every time I feel like it, but it doesn't actually deserve such treatment. Thought I'd share since it's been helping me a lot this week.

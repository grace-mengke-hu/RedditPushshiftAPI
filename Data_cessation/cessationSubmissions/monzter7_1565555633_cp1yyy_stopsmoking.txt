Started after 5 years of being clean

I smoked for the past week during anxiety attacks and trying to calm down with it. It doesn't help much. I just reach for it hoping it will help and it just makes me more anxious because I started with it again after I promised myself I won't. I am planning to stop after this I finish up with this last few cigarettes I have. 

With me luck guys. Gonna update on it, I need someone to hold me accountable.

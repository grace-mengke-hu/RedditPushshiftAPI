I failed. 36 days into the trash.

I feel miserable.

It was a night out and I had resisted huge cravings after drinking a lot of alcohol.

After managing to stay 5 hours without smoking while drinking, I finally gave in, because I was having fun with a girl who smoked. As simple as that. I feel so weak, so terribly pathetic you don't even have an idea. 

I enjoyed those cigarretes, and this is what is haunting me the most.

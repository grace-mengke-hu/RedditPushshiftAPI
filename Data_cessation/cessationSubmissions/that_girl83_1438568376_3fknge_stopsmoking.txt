Just dropping in to say... It really does get better!!

I quit November 5th, 2014. I used patch and gum for three months as directed. I had tried to quit a thousand times before, cold turkey, with no success. Do whatever the hell it takes to escape the demon and do not let anyone give you shit for it!

So I'm just about at nine months smoke free, and six months nicotine-free. FREEEEEEEEEEEEE!! It sucked, hard, and for a long time. For me, I don't know why, I had at least a slight desire to smoke for the first eight months. A couple times I cried and whined, and wondered if I would always have that desire in the back of my mind. I prayed and prayed to be relieved from the obsession.

Well here I am at nine months. I DO NOT THINK ABOUT SMOKING ON A DAILY BASIS. I AM FINALLY FUCKING FREE!! I'm quite excited about this, because I never knew if the time would arrive. Sidenote- even a slightly sad non-smoker is 100000x better than a sick addicted smoker!

 Don't give up before the miracle happens! Just hang in there! If it stayed so hard forever, no one would do it.

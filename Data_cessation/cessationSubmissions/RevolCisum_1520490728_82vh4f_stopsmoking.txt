Tastes

I'm only a few days in, but am already noticing benefits.  Posting and reading here a lot is helping so much!  Tonight, after I brushed my teeth, I grabbed the same floss I've been using for years to floss my teeth before bed.  I knew it was mint flavored, bc it says so on the package, but I've never actually tasted any mint when I used it.  Tonight, I totally did, and it tasted strong!  It's a pleasant taste, and I hate flossing, so perk of flossing being just a tad more enjoyable!  Just had my teeth cleaned a couple days ago too, so my mouth feels super squeaky clean and fresh!

Chantix Insomnia Side Effect?

I don't have insomnia at the onset of the night but I have woken up between 1:30-3:30 the last 5-6 days in a row and can't get back to sleep.  It's starting to take it's toll.

After the 2nd night I started to take Benedryl at night in hopes that it would get me to sleep through the night, to no avail.

Has anyone else experienced that?  If so, did you ride it out?  Did it go away?  Would your doctor prescribe any sleep medications in conjunction with the Chantix?  I am reticent to just quit the medication because I'm on day 16 and haven't smoked in 8 days so it's been successful in that area.

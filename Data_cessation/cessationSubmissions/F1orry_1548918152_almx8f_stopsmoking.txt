Things that have worked so far - day 19 after 9 years

This is my current list of things that help me to stay smoke free at the moment. What works for you?

1. reminding myself daily that I'm a non smoker by using the smoke free app
2. telling others that I quit daily via apps
3. responding to other non smoker's posts and messages for encouragment, support and identification 
4. taking it a day at a time
5. pausing, breathing, drinking water
6. extra attention to self care
7. more awareness to my thoughts, so my addict mind doesn't trick me
8. interpreting cravings as signs for needs and trying to meet them
9. practicing gratitude daily
10. celebrating my new freedom whenever possible 
11. feeling physical benefits with heightened awareness

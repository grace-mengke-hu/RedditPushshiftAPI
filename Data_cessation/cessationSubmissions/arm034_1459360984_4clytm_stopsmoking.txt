Just realized that I've gone 285 days without smoking!

The biggest part in helping me finally put out my last cigarette was truly wanting to quit and realizing that I didn't actually need another cigarette; That cigarette's don't control me and my actions. The day I told myself "I don't need you, cigarette. I can have a good time without you." was the day I quit.

Many thanks to this sub for helping me get to where I am today!

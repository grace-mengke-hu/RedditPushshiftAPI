Stopped smoking cigarettes almost 3 years ago...

EDIT: almost 4 years ago. March 06, 2014. Time sure does fly!

Came across this subreddit today, and wanted to share.

I managed to quit smoking cigarettes after about 15 years. Almost 3 years have passed now, and my lungs feel great. I had problems taking full breaths regularly when I was a little heavier, and smoking, but I can take a full breath pretty much any time I want now.

Main takeaway from smoking cigarettes, is the smell. Once you truly quit smoking, you realize how bad you smelled to everyone else who doesn't smoke. It's a disgusting smell. Very pungent, and perfumes and colognes do not entirely mask it, it just makes it worse. It hits your nose very quickly.

In the last year before I quit, I was down to about a 1/2 pack a day or less. I also used a nicotrol inhaler (nicotine-coated stone), for maybe a month, and then quit nicotine completely after that. I had tried to quit cold turkey when I was smoking more, but just couldn't do it for more than a day or so.

I encourage anyone reading this that is still struggling, to know how great it feels to be a non-smoker. To not be a victim of the cigarette/nicotine addiction any longer. They gross me out now, to the point of avoidance when it can be helped. There is also the obvious savings in money. 

I quit smoking for good after many attempts, and you can too!

Going on 12 years.

Wow. Stumbled here today. Don't give up! I quit February 2, 2004. My quit date was January 1, then February 1, and I finally made it February 2.

I quit cold turkey and used the guide that describes how your body is healing by hour, day, month, and year for my motivation. I told myself the first three days were the hardest and it was coasting from there, and - for the most part- I remember that to be true.

I can never and will never touch another cigarette again. 12 years. Wow. I did it.

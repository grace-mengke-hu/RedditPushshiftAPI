Desperate for some advice

I'm 22 and have been smoking for three years. Started smoking right after my dad passed away. I never really liked it..it just became a coping mechanism &amp; it worked. I've honestly "quit" 50 times. Whenever I'm feeling even SLIGHTLY stressed or upset I CRAVE a cigarette! Absolutely 0 self control when it comes to it. I also work as a server and I crave it the most when I'm working. I cant figure out why this is so hard for me...one of my biggest regrets is ever picking one up. You'd think that'd be enough to quit but no matter what, I always go back. Anyone have any advice? Anything that truly worked for you after going through something similar? :( Thanks in advance! (Mind my user name. Bf chose it for me when he got me started on here, pls take me seriously hahaha)

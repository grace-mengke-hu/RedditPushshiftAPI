Need to start again... had a big lapse last night

I smoked 7 cigarettes after 42 days non smoking (well I did have one a random day) straight after my sister told me that the cancer she had and was cleared has come back and she needs to start chemo and all the horrible process again. Why I did that? I was so sad, had a horrible evening and just left the house to buy cigarettes and a bottle of wine. Today I feel even more sad than yesterday, spent 10 quid in cigs and alcohol and finished the night semi drunk, crying, putting in the bin the 3 cigarettes I didn't smoke. Why I did that? I don't know why I reacted like this. far to be proud of myself :(

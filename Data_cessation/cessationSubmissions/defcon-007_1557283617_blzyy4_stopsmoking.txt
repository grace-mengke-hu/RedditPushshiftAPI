One should quit abruptly or gradually?

So I have been smoking for around two years now and finally decided to quit. I smoke around 3-4 cigs daily. I tried quitting abruptly before but the cravings are too strong. I was thinking to take it slow now, like start with 2 daily, then bring it down to one and then 0. Any suggestions?

Back to Day 1

I stopped smoking in July, 2012 and lasted for 9 full months before I decided to just have one cigarette after I'd been drinking.  6 months after that an I'm here again back to smoking 1/2 a pack a day.   2 nights ago I threw all my cigarettes out and didn't smoke at all yesterday.  

I've done it before and I know I can definitely quit again, this time I'm just hoping it's forever.

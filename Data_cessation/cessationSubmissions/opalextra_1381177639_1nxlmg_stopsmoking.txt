My first day almost coming to an end

This is my third time I decide to quit for over 16 years. I have been a pack a day guy since I was seventeen years old... But this weekend I got drunk and smoked 2 packs (which I Usually do when I'm drunk) and I woke up with big pain in my lungs and I felt really short of breath all day. It good now but hell I was scared yesterday. I have been thinking about quitting for a long time, but for the last couple of months that urge as gotten bigger. 

But I need some advice... for example, I have a huge craving for a cigarette right now, and I decided to go Cold Turkey since one of the reason quitting is short of cash. 

Where can I find an app for Windows phone/Macbook about how much money I'm saving each day... That could really boost my effort in quitting.

Thanks in advance

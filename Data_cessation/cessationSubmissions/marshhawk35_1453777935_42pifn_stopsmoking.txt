The good news

At 43 days:

* My skin is so clear! After years of terrible acne, it is all gone. ALL OF IT. I realized that my skin had only got bad when I started smoking, too. 

* I'm finally breathing easier. I'm amazed at how deep of a breath I can take now. Climbing stairs is so much easier.

* My teeth and eyes are brighter. It's noticeable.

* I've got spare money at the end of the paycheck. Like way more than I expected. And that is REALLY sweet.

* I can smell everything from 10 miles away. The good and the bad. Worth it.

The psychological challenges are still hard and I get tired and frustrated sometimes, but it gets better every single day. I'm starting to feel like an ex-smoker, not just a smoker who is trying to stop. 

Just wanted to share some positive words today. Thank you so much to everyone who contributes to this community. I feel like this sub was the support I was missing the other 9,000 times I quit before and failed.

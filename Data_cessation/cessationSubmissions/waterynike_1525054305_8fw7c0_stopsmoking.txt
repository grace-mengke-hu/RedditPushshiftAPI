Has anyone made multiple changes at once?

I thought I was having a MS attack (I’ve had MS for 21 years with no symptoms at all)  but I actually had hurt my back. It did scare me enough to change my lifestyle because it could have been worse or a MS flair. In the past 6 weeks I have 
-went to a mostly vegetarian diet
-started training program and yoga
-not drank
-started MS medicine 

And last week stopped smoking. I’m kind of figuring that I can be miserable for a month doing a bunch of new stuff and getting rid of bad. And I was ok until yesterday (in fact I never had more energy in the past years) and I know it is the stopping smoking. Today has just been terrible.

If anyone has done a massive lifestyle change at once can you give me tips? How did you do it?

Snacks to help quit

What’s up everyone. I’ve been a smoker for about 4 years now and wanna quit before it gets too bad. I was up to a pack and a half of Camels a day as of two weeks ago when I decided to try going cold turkey. Obviously that didn’t work, but I started smoking Spirits and have cut down to about a pack every 3 days. I have a long flight next week and am planning to smoke my last cigarette prior to that. I’m gonna switch to light spirits this week to ween myself off, but would like some snacks I can have around to eat compulsively when I feel the craving. Any ideas? I’d like to avoid the mess of sunflower seeds which seems to be a go-to for smokers.

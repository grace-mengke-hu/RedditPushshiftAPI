Smoking has taken over my [M/18] life

Hi guys,
I've posted here before, saying how I'm going to quit and stuff...and well that really just went to shit. I started smoking last July/August, in November I turned 18 so therefore I was legally allowed to buy cigarettes. Since then I've been going through a 19 pack of cigarettes a day, which roughly costs around Â£7.15

As I'm a student, with no part time job, I cannot afford to do this. I used to waste my money on stuff I love; like video games, comic books, dvds etc. but now all my money is going on cigarettes. It gets to the point where if I'm really skint, I'll use my travel/lunch money for college to buy a 10 pack, just to keep me going. 

As I stated before, I've tried to quit but have ended up going back to smoking. When I'm at college, during my breaks it gives me something to do. When I'm at home, I just do it for the sake of it. Simple things like walking to the train station, listening to music and stuff like that seem really hard to do when I have no cigarettes. 

All my friends smoke and they're in denial that it's actually doing them any harm, both physically and financially, which brings me onto my next issue. I've found that since I've started smoking that I've started to get ill more often, whether it be coughing, getting colds, or even smoking so much that I'm literally throwing up. My diet is pretty much junk food which really doesn't help, but the smoking is definitely taking a toll on me, so God knows what's going to happen if I carry on.

Basically, I just want to quit. I feel as though smoking has taken over my life and I don't want to carry on doing it anymore. I don't want to waste my money on it anymore, and I don't want to feel as though every single thing that I do has to be done with a cigarette in my mouth. We all make mistakes in life, and starting smoking is definitely the biggest one I've made.

Forever is a long time, but today, today I can handle for SURE.

I'm at 11 days. One of the main things that helped me make it day after day, is just taking it a day at a time. I say to myself, I will go to sleep tonight, not having smoked a cigarette. 

I dont say I'm quitting smoking forever and I have my whole life of not smoking to worry about.

I just say: "Tonight, I will go to sleep and lay down in bed, knowing I resisted any urges to smoke, and I will wake up tommorow full of energy and proud of myself".

Forever is a long time, but today, today I can handle for SURE.

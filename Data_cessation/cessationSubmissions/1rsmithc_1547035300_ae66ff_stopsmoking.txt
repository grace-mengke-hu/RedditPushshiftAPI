13 days smoke free - Oh my GOD I'm in a foul mood

Smoking 10 years, 15 per day. Have been nicotine free 13 days so far

So far my quit has been painless... Aside from a pretty vicious cough which has now gone away I've not had much in the way of cravings or irritability. In fact I've been on a bit of a high for the last 10 days and just in a really good mood. 

Today though I am in a foul mood. Feel utterly depressed, lethargic and absolutely ZERO motivation to do anything. Just feeling very apathetic about the world. Really hoping it's just a temporary mood swing as it's bloody awful. 

Anyway - didn't have anyone to share this with so hope you don't mind me venting on HERE!

Being able to quit smoking is like a blessing, sometimes I can't believe I was a smoker.

Went from heavy daily smoker in college nothing for a couple months now. Il still buy 10 pieces of nicotine gum when I get a craving but I never thought I would lose the desire to smoke. My lungs are clear, I feel healthy. Sometimes I can't believe I used to smoke or even smell like that all the time.

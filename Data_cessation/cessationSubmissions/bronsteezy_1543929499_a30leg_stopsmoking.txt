Unmaking it your crutch

Hey. I used this subreddit (and weed) to quit in April of this year (on my one year anniversary of smoking cigs). I lasted admirably until September, and it's day three of my second quit.

Old associations will gradually be replaced with new, healthy connections. Time and practice make the task doable and life normal once again.

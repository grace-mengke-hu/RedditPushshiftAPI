Oral fixation; need advice.

I have an oral fixation that I cannot get a handle on. I quit smoking cigarettes years ago in exchange for marijuana. My oral fixation had me smoking upwards of 10 joints a day... so this has started getting in the way of other parts of my life. I stopped smoking weed and now my oral fixation has me back on cigarettes. How do I curb this lust to have a smoke? It feels so relaxing to just puff on something, how do I replace this habit???

Been trying for years now and I always come back to some form of smoking.

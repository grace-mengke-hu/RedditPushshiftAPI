Quitting smoking on Wednesday, wish me luck

I've been smoking since I was 17, I'm 35. I've quit a few times before for 6months to a year. It's far past time to finally quit for good. My plan is to use an ecig for a little bit to step down (maybe for about a week or two, gradually taking down the nicotine levels). I just wanted to put that out there and hopefully this will keep me accountable :)

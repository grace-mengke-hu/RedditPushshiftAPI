How long does the lung butter last?

coming up on 2 weeks not smoking, still coughing up as much of the nasty shit as I was when I smoked.  I know it's different for everybody, but roundabout how long should this part of the process take to clear itself up?

Edit:  I'm please to note that the worst of it is over at around 3 weeks.

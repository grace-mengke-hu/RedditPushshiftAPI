QOM

I'm just shy of one year (10/01) This is the first time I've quit because I was ready, not because of circumstances. I have been road biking for the last 1.5 years but this year I got serious about it. In the year since I quit smoking 

I've logged 6 Centuries (100 miles in a day ride)
2,683 miles on my bike
99,101 feet of elevation
Lost 25 lbs
And yesterday I got Queen of the Mountain (QOM) in our bike sprinting group on a segment I've been chasing for a bit now. 6.6 miles in 17:58

I'm pretty damn pleased and just want to say if I can do it, you can too.  Sometimes you just have to take it a day at a time.

2,160 Hours

Hey all, 

I wrote [blog post](http://www.cragglerock.com/rambling/8/7/2016/2160-hours) about the 90 days (91 now!) since I've quit smoking. Reading stories here has helped me a lot over the last 3 months so hopefully I can return the favour a little. 

If you don't want to give my site traffic, here's the whole thing below sans links and some formatting: 

Dear Reader, 

At the time of writing it’s been approximately 2,160 hours since my last cigarette, it’s late, I’m having difficulty sleeping, and I’m thinking about time again.

I’ve made some significant changes in the last 90 days and I found myself reflecting on them. I’ve broken a couple long-term habits, done some things I wouldn’t have done (or had the motivation to do) while I frittered and wasted the hours in an offhand way by getting high most evenings and playing video games.

Additionally, the time I’ve saved from not rolling joints/cigarettes or taking smoke breaks in work and at home has allowed me to get more done with my day, and been surprisingly noticeable to me. Before I list out some of the things I’ve done in the 90 days, let’s do some rough - and please forgive the crudeness of this - napkin math for time saved by not smoking over this period: 

4 @ 15 mins each (rolling + smoking) x 5 days a week (in work) = 300 mins  
300 mins x 12.8 weeks = 3,840 mins  
2 at home @ approx 30 mins each (rolling + smoking) x 7 days = 420 mins  
420 x 12.8 weeks = 5,376 mins  

Result = 153.6 hrs saved (or 6.4 days) - at least.  

Bear in mind we’re not including time spent smoking with friends, smoking extra on the weekends, spending entire days completely baked, etc. Even as a rough estimate that’s still a significant chunk of time I could’ve spent doing something more productive with myself, and if you were to take that number and extrapolate it over years…fuck…that’s, like, a lot time man. 

With some help from the time saved above, in the 90 days since I quit smoking I have also:    

* Gradually had more energy. 
* Started to regain some mental focus. I think.  
* Had hemorrhoids and successfully rid myself of them with the power of modern medicine. Fuck yeah, anal suppositories. 
* Began a de-clutter process around the house, getting rid of items I/we no longer use or have no future use for. We’re nowhere near finished with this but it’s helped to remove some of the anxiety I was having about owning stuff and not actually using it (why own it if you don’t need it?).
* Took part in the Darkness Into Light fundraiser for Pieta House. 
* Started a movie podcast with 2 friends, and recorded 6 episodes to date. 
* Saw Bruce Springsteen live in Croke Park. 
* Attended 2 OTT Wrestling Shows. 
* Expanded my drawing paraphernalia and subscribed to Scrawlrbox in order to get even more awesome stuff to scribble with. 
* Gotten new glasses (because my other ones were fucked and held together with sellotape). 
* Put on about 14lbs (mostly in the gut region) because I’m eating more now.
* Started going to the gym to try directly counter the above. Not as easy as I had hoped but I’m working on it!
* Completed approximately 40 drawings and counting.   
* Celebrated my son’s 11th birthday.  

The above might not seem like much to a lot of people but, to me, this has been a significant 2,160 hours in my life. For a long time I considered myself a “high-functioning stoner” and I genuinely believed it - it may have even been true for a period. To spare you the details: it was time to make a change and reclaim time for myself and loved ones.  

I’m not trying get at all preachy and claim that giving up smokes and weed have changed my life because that would be hyperbole. Simply put, I felt like I spent lot of years doing fuck all when I could’ve been doing more with myself, so I made conscious decision to cut out 2 habits that I personally felt were having a negative impact on my quality of life.  

In the end it might work out, it might not, but I’m going to give it a fucking shot and try to make the most of it.    

Until next time.

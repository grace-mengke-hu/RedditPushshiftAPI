Almost five days.

I'm 28 and this is really my first attempt since I began around seventeen. I guess I was always a light smoker, five to seven a day , I've never smoked a pack in a day. I have to admit it was easier than I thought, or at least it has been so far. I really haven't expirenced any of the physical withdrawal. I know its early still but I am optimistic.

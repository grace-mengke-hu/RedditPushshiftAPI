Day 1

Been wanting to quit for sometime now.   I'm extremely active and practice yoga daily and have always been a runner... And a smoker.   Something doesn't add up in that equation.   I got patches and gum fromy VA doc.   Woke up this morning and currently sitting outside with my coffee without a cigarette in my hand.   My mom died at 49 from hypertension,  she was a smoker.   I'm 32.  Something has to change and I feel the time is now.

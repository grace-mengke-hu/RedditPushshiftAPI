Help

Im trying to quit smoking we desperately need the money. Between me and my soon to be husband we spend 600 a month on cigarettes.  I get to the 5 or 6 hour mark and cave. Im at the 7hr mark and im typing this with tears and a cigarette burning ive had one drag off of and its almost out. How do you quit when stressed to the max? How do you make it past the first couple of days without gum or candy ?

Stopped smoking, day 8. Effects?

I stopped smoking on the 13th.  

I believe that on day 2 I caught a minor cold.  Strangely, it is very minor, but I just haven't been able to beat it yet.  

I have a lot of inner ear ache/pain - sore throat - phlegm.  Is that normal after quitting smoking?

Also - does your body/lungs purge any of the crap that you inhaled for years?

I have the appetite, energy, and feel better in general.  

Other than the "you'll feel great" effects of stopping smoking, what are some of the others that I can expect?

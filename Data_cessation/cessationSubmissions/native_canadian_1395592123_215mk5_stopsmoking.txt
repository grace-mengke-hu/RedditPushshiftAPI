On Day 2, feeling fine

Pack a day smoker for years... switched to the e-cig for bout 8 months... went back to cigs for the last few weeks, but now on day 2 and not suffering at all:

Only things that have helped:
1) Orange Pekoe Black Tea rather than Coffee
2) Walking
3) Lorazapem (Benzodiazipine)


Things that are making cravings worse:

Coca-Cola,

Coffee,

Copious Amounts of Water (absolutely horrible feeling and craving for cigarettes)

Camomile Tea specifically, not sure about other herbal teas

Fatty Foods like potato chips and whatnot. Cheese however no, even though that's all saturated fat.

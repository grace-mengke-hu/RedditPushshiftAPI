Day 2. Feeling better than I was yesterday.

So I’ve decided to quit. I’ve told people over the years that you won’t ever hear me say “I’m gonna quit” unless I mean it, and so it’s held true til now. I quit for about 3 months in 2017 until my wife’s (fiancé at the time) smoking ended up being too much to handle. But this time, she’s decided she’s gonna try to quit with me. I highly doubt that she will be able to this time, as it’s her first time ever trying, but I’m starting to gain confidence that I’m going to be able to do it. 

I’ve been using a Juul and trying to avoid habits and situations that make me want to smoke for about a week now, and haven’t bought a pack since last Friday. Sunday was my last cigarette and now I’ve been around a lit cigarette about half a dozen times and managed to stay strong. 

The Juul really helps right now, even though I know it’s not a complete solution, but I think it’s going to do more for those trigger points than anything else, aka after a meal, hopping in the car, sitting down to relax after work. Hopefully I can start decreasing the nicotine levels soon and eventually faze it out, I foresee my biggest problem being that I enjoy the act of inhaling and exhaling the smoke/vapor more than anything.

I take adderal every day which has been my biggest problem/excuse so far, and let me tell you it makes it hard. But before this week I was smoking almost 3 packs a day, so I’ve seen these couple days as a pretty big milestone. Anyway. Don’t really have anyone to talk to this about because I know that psychologically, that dopamine hit from telling people you’re quitting can be enough to throw you off track, so thanks to y’all for reading and keep the hard work to all of you guys fighting this fight. It can be done! Let’s do it together.

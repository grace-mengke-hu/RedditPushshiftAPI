After perfect 2 days unfortunately I smoke and really regretted it

Hi, I’m using nicotine patches and it was really good and helpful for the first two days. But now, at midnight I could not resist to craving and went to find cigarettes and smoke one. I feel terrible right now. I’m an animal rescuer and I see really terrible things all the time. One of my friends sent me a picture and video  of a tortured dog in order to take an advice about what can we do and although  I couldn’t even look at the actual video, I felt huge amount stress, went to find a cigarette. But I have to learn how to deal with this since I have to deal with lots of stress on a daily basis. What should I do? Any advice will be really helpful :(

Ended my stopsmoking streak...

After over 120 days of smoke free... I opened up a pack of cigarettes today again...

Q1: Did I have any cravings?
A: First 30 days only. After 30 days, no crave at all. I got used to drinking coffee without cigarettes.

Q2: When did you slip first time?
A: I was bored and took a puff after 56 days... Threw up and thought “Damn they taste like shit..”

Q3: How did you start again then?
A: I ocasionally took a cigarette (only 2 a month) and really really had no crave after them + I took few puffs and threw it away.
Then I thought that I was superior and  that I can smoke once or twice in a month without getting hooked again. But they won this time. I started to get cravings few days ago.

Guys. Not even one puff. I just smoked my 7th cigarette today and I am ready to start over again.

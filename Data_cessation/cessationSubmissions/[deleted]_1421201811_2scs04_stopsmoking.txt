31 mother flippin days

Really feels awesome. 

Quit cold turkey after waking up on a Saturday, having my morning smoke and deciding I was done. I did 1 day with a patch but decided I wanted to try without any help. I did read Allen Carrs "Easy Way" last year when I tried to quit. I remembered a lot of what I had learned so I didn't read it again. It really isn't as difficult as the world wants you to think it is. When you're ready to quit, you're ready and nothing will stand in your way. 

Oh, and I decided to buy myself a nice new TV for my new apartment with all the cigarette money I will save this year. 

Good luck all!!

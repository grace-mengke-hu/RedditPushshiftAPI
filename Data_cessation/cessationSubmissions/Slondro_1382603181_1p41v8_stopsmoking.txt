Quit smoking - how to replace it?

Hey all, I'm an American living in Japan. Smoking seems more widespread here than America, and there is quite a bit more acceptance of it--lots of cafes/bars/restaurants are just overflowing with smoke.

Anyway, I quit about 2 1/2 months ago, and it actually hasn't been so bad. The girlfriend is very sensitive to smoke, so I was only smoking during breaks at work, and then I cut that out.

I find myself needing something to punctuate events. I liked to have a cigarette after I finished a job, while taking a breather, or in the 10 minutes before going home. Sadly, that has all been replaced with snacks, and my belt is not thanking me.

Can anyone here relate? I do like tea and coffee, so those are ideas, I suppose.

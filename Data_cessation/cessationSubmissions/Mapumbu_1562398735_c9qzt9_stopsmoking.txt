I made it through a funeral. To day 6

Day 6 is always a key day to make it to as I find the physical withdrawals die down significantly on day 6.

Yesterday was my grandmother's funeral. Funerals are always hard not to smoke at because you think: what the hell, we're all going to die anyway. But wait: just because we're all going to die, why would that make me want to spend my alive time wheezing and stinking; a LOSER addicted to this pathetic little weed?

Had a beer at the wake. Dangerous.... but I was safe. There were no other smokers there. On the drive home, stopped into a starbucks and as I was leaving, there was a lady smoking. I felt like asking her for one. Just 1 cigarette. For the funeral.

There is never just 1 cigarette. Each cigarette causes a desire for the next one. And this time I am not going to get to the perimeter fence of the prison, scale the fence and then knock on the prison door and asked to be let back in.

So I didn't ask her for one. I would be on day 1 again if I had. I would have felt so low.

I have made it to day 6. I'm free.

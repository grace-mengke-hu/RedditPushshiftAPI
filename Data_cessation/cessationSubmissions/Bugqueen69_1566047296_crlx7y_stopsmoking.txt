Trying to quit, BF chain smokes :/

I started smoking about a year and a half ago, people(customers) at work (i bartend) were always going out for little breaks and when i was drinking, id have one etc..... Anyways, ended up basically going thru a divorce around thr same time so i was stresses out and really needed those breaks and those friendships to keep my shiz together. 

One of those friends i have now been dating for a year.  He smokes like a pack a day and now we live together. Often when he's smoking when we are together, we share the cigarettes.... Its like evwry 15 minutes.. So bad... 

Anyways, i am in a panic. Hes beeen smoking ten years, me a year and a half. I have kids. I hate smoking.  I had one cig two days ago and then 0 yesterday and i feel fine without them but i am super stressed bc we jist got into a little ffight ish thing and now alllllllll i want is to go buy a pack. But that means i just go thru the whole "after this pack im done" bullshit all over again. I had NO cigs yesterday. Today should be day 2. 

Anyways, i love our little breaks that we take for a cig but like hoooowwww do i quit when he smokes so much?? How do i continue to take little breaks with him and not give in to cravings? And when im not amoking how do i deal with his disgusting cig stank?? Lol.    


Anyone else ever quit when an SO still smoked? I need encouragement and stories!!! 





Summary: my so smokes a pack a day. I want to quit. Whats it like to quit when your so still smokes and you always used to enjoy those little breaks together? And how do you deal with the smell??

My first smoking related dream.

I always thought it was quite weird with the dreams and all, but that must have been because I never had one. I'm in bed now and just dreamt that I was in a trailer park discussing blues and having cigarettes with an older man. When I woke up I was really disappointed in myself for smoking. But in all my confusion it struck me: I've never met Johnny winter. I laughed at myself and feel great. Now I understand you dreamers out there.

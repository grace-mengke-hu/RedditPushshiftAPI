failed - just removed my badge - will start again

Well, I quit around mid July. Went about a month and a half without smoking. Then I bummed a couple from a neighbor and a few days later bummed a couple from somebody else. Then I found some when I was walking my dog, they were in fine condition so I smoked them. Well shit then 2 days ago I bought a pack and smoked them.

I just removed my badge and I will reset it and start over.

Yeah shit, it's true........ NOT ONE PUFF EVER. I guess I didn't believe that but I do now.

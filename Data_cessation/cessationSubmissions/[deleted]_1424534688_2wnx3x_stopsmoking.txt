How do you guys feel about e-cigs?

I've been using e-cigs for a year now. I upgraded my tank and batteries several times and I'm quite happy with what I've got now. Of course I make my own juice to save money but also saves the hassle of going to a shop to purchase juice. All in all I've spent much less on the equipment than normal cigs.

I've relapsed several times, more times than I can count due to work, stress, being tired etc. But every time I do I feel the effects of cigs and I just feel slow, tired, sleep much worse (this is the one that gets me the most). And every time I go back to my e-cig, the less I want to smoke cigs.

I'm slowly programming my brain to hate cigarettes even under the conditions I use to relapse. Any of you care to share?

General consensus: An addiction is an addiction, even if a better option. So if you're like me and vape nic juice, make sure you have a plan to quit that too. At least for me, it's a step in the right direction but I will prepare mentally to quit vaping in the long run. Thank you all for sharing!

Almost 3 days.

I haven't had one cigarette, that's not to say that I haven't thought about it, but I think I'm doing well so far, I've been working, dealing with a lot of shitty people but I've been taking it well, there's not even been one occurrence when I flew off the handle (which is surprising), and here's the kicker, I drank today and didn't even think about going down to the store to buy a packet. WOOHOO!

It's only early days so I know I can't say too much, but I feel like I can really kick this thing this time. 

How are you all going?

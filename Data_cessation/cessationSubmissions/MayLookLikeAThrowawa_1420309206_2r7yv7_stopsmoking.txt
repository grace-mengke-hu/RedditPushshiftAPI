The famous "Easy Way to Quit Smoking" vs. not being the actual smoker?

I myself am not a smoker but a close family member of mine is and I'd love her to quit. The problem is, there's no way in hell she'd ever read a book about quitting smoking cause, you know, "she just likes it" and all that generic smoker's jazz. Anything to play it down. The regular "smoking causes tons of nasty stuff" doesn't work either, as could be predicted. 

I researched a bit and found that A LOT of people are praising Allen Carr's "The Easy Way to Quit Smoking" as if it were a miracle cure. Thus, I though I could read it myself, even though I don't smoke - the question I have is: is there something in that book that I could tell the said family member to maybe get her to think about her addiction? Something different that "you don't really need that cigarette" (to which I'm sure she'd just say "I sure do, I like them!" succeeded by some defense mechanism like "You eat junk food, too, don'tcha? And it ain't healthy either!")?

In short: does this book work only if the addicted himself is reading it or did anyone have some success in helping somebody quit while not being a smoker themselves thanks to the knowledge gathered from it?

Relapse Prevention Button?

I just checked out /r/NoFap from the sidebar and noticed they have a cool [Relapse Prevention button](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/)that links [here](https://emergency.nofap.com/).

I think that's a great tool.  I believe there are public/NFP organizations that have counselor hotlines, right?  I know I have one through work and they have been very helpful for general counseling, but not great when in a pinch (you have to set an appointment).  

What do you think, would we be able to aggregate some of the resources that are out there?

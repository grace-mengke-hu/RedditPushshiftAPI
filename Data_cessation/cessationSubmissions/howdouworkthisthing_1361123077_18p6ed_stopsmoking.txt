I've accidentally quit smoking. Sort of? Story inside. Need help keeping it up. 

I'm trying to think of how to type this all out so that it makes sense. Here is the whole story, and I'm sorry if it turns into a wall of text:

Monday night I don't sleep. I have crazy pains in my stomach. By about 6AM Tuesday morning I decide I cannot handle it any longer, and I head to the ER **leaving my cigarettes at home.** After testing and waiting, that afternoon they tell me they're gonna take my gallbladder out. I call Mom and Dad they come take me to their place and I stay with them while I was waiting for them to call me back in. By Thursday I'm feeling a lot better and decide I wanna head back into my own place and I smoked the few cigarettes I had left except for one. Friday AM they call me in and I smoke my last one on the way. Actually, I didn't even finish it, I had like 5 puffs, but anyway. In the last 6 days I've smoked for one day (or, 24 hour period)

So, basically, I've just been too sore to go buy cigarettes and I worry that once I get back to my place I will be heading right to the store. But I've been coughing up all this gunk (seriously you guys ... it's so gross) and I just like the idea of that not being in my system anymore. Although, it does hurt to cough, for reals.

Any words of encouragement? My boyfriend quit smoking over the summer, and it was easy for him. I guess. He just stopped one day and that was it. I feel like when he talks about quitting ... I dunno, he's just not helpful? I know he doesn't mean to be, but it always comes across as preachy.

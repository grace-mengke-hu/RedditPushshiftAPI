Gaining So Much Weight

20 days quit now and I'm fatter than I have ever been in my entire life. I don't know what's happening. It's so discouraging because I don't really eat more than I used to except for the first three days in which I let myself go because they were the hardest days. Lately ive been controlling my portions a bit and choosing to eat more fruits and veggies when i previously would eat only meat at every meal. I even doubled my exercise length and frequency.

But I've gained a lot of weight. A lot by my standards. 7-10 lbs. I've been enviably lean all my life and now no one would ever describe me as thin anymore. My clothes are hard to move in as they don't fit anymore. 

I know this is all because of quitting smoking. Messing with my metabolism. It sucks, but I'm also proud of myself but also really disheartened by what I see in the mirror. Apart from smelling better and sense of taste improving I really dont see that much tangible physiological benefit to having quit. Help.

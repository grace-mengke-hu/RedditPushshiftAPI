Depression and lack of sex drive?

I'll preface and apologize if this is a ranty wall of text.
So. 27f, quit smoking 9 days ago with what seemed like too much ease. I quit in July of 2013 for almost a year, but I vaped for the first few months. It was really easy for me to kick the vaping. It was also really easy to start smoking again while being out drinking with friends. I know several people fall down that same way. I realized after about 6 months of smoking again, it was getting hard to breathe again and I started coughing like an 80 year old chain smoker and I wasn't okay with that.
This time around has been cold turkey. I've had maybe one craving, the rest seemed to be pretty smooth sailing. Until about 5 days in, I was great. Now I'm depressed and have zero sex drive. I don't feel like myself at all without a sex drive. I went from a pretty high libido to literally feeling like I might as well abstain for the rest of my life. Twice in the last week, I've turned my husband down. In our 7 year relationship, I have NEVER done that. Sex makes me happy and when I don't even want it, I'm lost. If I'm upset/anxious/happy/sad, I want to have sex. Now here I am, more depressed than I have ever been and seriously feel like I don't know what to do with myself. I wish I would have never started smoking again. I know I need to figure out something else to keep occupied but I just wish I wanted to have sex with my husband. I don't know if I'm depressed because I have no libido or if I have no libido because I'm depressed. I don't want to smoke. I have no desire, but I miss desiring my husband and wish I could just pull my head out of the sand and get my life back in order again. 
I just need to hear if anyone else has ever experienced this issue. I know removal of nicotine will make you depressed but just curious to know if anyone else has come across this. Help :(

Day 1 - I can do this!

Day 1 of stopping smoking. Ok, I had a roly when I woke up then asked myself why when I have patches in the cupboard. So on with one I went. 
I have a horrible head cold at the moment and can hardly breathe anyway so now is as good a time as ever eh? 
Itâ€™s also half term with an 8 and 4 year old at home for the week - am I mad!?

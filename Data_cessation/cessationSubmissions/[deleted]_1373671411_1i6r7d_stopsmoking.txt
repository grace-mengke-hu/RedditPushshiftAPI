Almost at 100 days and I blew it.

So upset with myself I can't even.

Almost a hundred damn days without a square and then I decide to start smoking bud again two days ago. Within a few hours I had purchased a pack because having a cigarette when you're high is the best. Or so I thought. My lungs are stuffy, I already smoked a pack in a day, I'm so pissed and confused with myself. Not only have I taken a giant step backwards, but I feel like I lost such a great streak... this is the longest I've ever gone without smoking.

Quitting never felt so good

I quit 3months and 20 days ago. I’m from the UK and I was in Australia on a holiday when I decided to quit. I was spending all my holiday money on smokes &amp; my allergies were really acting up so I thought, nope, the cigarettes have got to go. I’m now back in the uk, and being able to bare a 21 hour flight without craving was amazing. I no longer have an ashy feeling mouth or panic when I’m running out of cigs. I’m so happy to take my life back finally from the grips of nicotine addiction

Quit cold turkey, after smoking 15/20 a day for 6 years

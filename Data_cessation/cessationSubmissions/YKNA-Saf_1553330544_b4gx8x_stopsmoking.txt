End of Month Three

Hey, so nearly the end of March and I have not smoked. Pat on the back, saved over Â£1000 thanks not buy the toxins, and im so glad i have invested all my savings [buying ripple](https://www.xch4nge.com), 4000 of them, so far, with the money I saved.  However not sure the last few days all of a sudden the cravings have come back with a bang. It strange how they just randomly come back. But anyone else getting ready to starting month 4 had this issue.

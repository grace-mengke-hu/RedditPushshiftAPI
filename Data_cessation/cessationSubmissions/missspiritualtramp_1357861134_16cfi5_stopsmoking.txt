Day 11 - pissed off, crying mess and cold symptoms started today.  Huh?

I've been having the best quit ever, until today.  It's so bizarre!  I was feeling pretty decent all day until I was walking home at about 4pm and my brain went crazy, just over-thinking (something I do pretty regularly anyway) and feeling so, so sorry for myself.  Not even craving smokes just feeling FUCKING ANGRY at the world.  When I got into my building I nearly crashed into a man leaving the elevator because I couldn't hold back the tears another 20 seconds to get to my place.  When I did make it to my apartment door, my keys stuck a bit and I punched the door really hard about 4 or 5 times, then spent the next 10 minutes just sobbing uncontrollably.  2 hours later, I'm still a bit weepy, and now my nose is so stuffed up I feel like a cold is coming on.  The weirdest part really is that I don't crave a smoke!  I don't want to smoke I just feel like absolute shit.
Quitting is weird.

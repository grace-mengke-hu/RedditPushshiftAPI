Moment of weakness after two weeks

I am having a very trying day today. I want to smoke a cigarette SO BAD. In my mind, I picture myself walking up to the coworkers that will definitely let me bum a smoke. I see myself lighting it and taking a long deep drag. I can't stop thinking about it. I don't want to give in, but it's somehow very hard to get over this craving when I'm having such a tough day at work. I need advice as to how to cope with this mood-related craving.

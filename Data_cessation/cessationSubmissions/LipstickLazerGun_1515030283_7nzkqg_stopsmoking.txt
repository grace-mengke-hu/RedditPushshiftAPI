What are you doing with all the money you are saving?

I've started a separate savings account and have just deposited the $12.50 (rounded down quite a bit) I've saved from not smoking my usual two packs. I think seeing that balance grow IRL and not just in the app will give me the endorphin boost I need to get through bad cravings.

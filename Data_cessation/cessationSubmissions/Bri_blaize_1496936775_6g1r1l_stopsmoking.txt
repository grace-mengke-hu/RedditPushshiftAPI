Day5 - join a community

It's day 5 and this sucks.  At the recommendation of a stop smoking app, I've joined this forum.
After 20 years of neglecting my body by smoking a pack a day, I'm finally at the point of disgust.  With that, its been a major struggle as my body is adjusting.  Just hacked up something fierce... I suppose that's a good thing?

Things I'm doing to stop:  patches, app, breathing exercises. 

If anyone has any other tips, I'm open to hearing it out. 

Good luck in your personal journey.

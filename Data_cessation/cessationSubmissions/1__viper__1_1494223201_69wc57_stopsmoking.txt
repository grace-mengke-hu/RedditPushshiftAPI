3 months smoke free.

After smoking for over 20yrs I finally said enough is enough and quit cold turkey. 

I started walking first thing in the morning instead of having a smoke and coffee. I didn't drink a beer for 4 weeks to avoid cravings. I can't believe how much better I feel. 

I don't cough all the time, I don't stink, I don't have to scrub dirty nicotine stains from my fingers. Life is pretty good. 

It I can go cold turkey after smoking a pouch of tobacco every 2.5 days then I know you guys can. 

Things that helped me get to this stage in my quit in no particular order.

1. Go for walks. 
2. Do the dishes. 
3. Cut the lawns and weed.
4. Quit drinking coffee
5. Quit drinking beer for first 4 weeks.
6. Do the laundry, fold and out away. 
7. Drink a lot of water. 

And if you are generally unhealthy and over weight like I was there is never a better time to change your habits. I've changed my whole diet and walk 5km every morning before work. I've dropped 11kg since Feb 6th.

Quiting smoking didn't kill me and it won't kill you either. There are only positive outcomes. 

Good luck with your own quit.

Smoked. Maybe i can't white knuckle this shit

I think it was the combination of a long day, some general life related stress and a lot of caffeine. I think i've seen something on here about how too much caffeine is a trigger. I think that's something that i should look out for in the future. I'm also going to buy lozenges/gum. Going to give that another shot. Keeping my head up.

NEXT MAN UP!

Help

Maybe I need to see my therapist shout this but I'm very close to having a cigarette right now.

Every reason to stay quit... 

No stains on fingers, no chest pains, breathe easier, smell better, more attractive, better exercise, better teeth and gums, and more money. 

These all seem to be vanishing lately. I've been nicotine free for 18 days. It's the longest I've ever gone. But in the past few days I've had some realizations about myself that are really making me hate my personality. I've always had this problem even when I was a kid. I'm always judging myself even when I do the right thing sometimes. I am my greatest enemy and the more I fight back the harder it gets.

I don't have time to get personal with what I am going through in my head but basically I've realized why I act the way I do towards people and that Im basically a tool and try to reflect what people want me to be. I also take advantage of girls in relationships and throw them away when things get intimate. I have been doing this for so long I have become disassociated with myself. I don't even know who I am anymore. What I want in life or respecting my needs cause I don't even know what I want or need. 

I feel really lost and I'm sorry to vent my personal life to you guys. This is just the thinking I'm going through which is making me want to smoke. I feel like nothing anyone can say will change my mind because I'm starting to realize I quit smoking for the praise from other people that I'm amazing for quitting. I did it for other people and not myself and with realizing that people aren't always going to praise me it becomes pointless. Regardless, I should want to quit for myself and believe that it really doesn't help but all I do is try and convince myself every day and the battle never ends. I don't know if I can do this anymore.

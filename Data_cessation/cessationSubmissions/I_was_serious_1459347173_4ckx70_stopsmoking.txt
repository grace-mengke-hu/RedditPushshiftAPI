Trying to Hang In There...Seriously Might Not Make It

So I have problems with anxiety and I stopped taking meds for it years ago. For the past two days, I've been dealing with non-stop anxiety like I'm on the verge of a panic attack, and I am likely to end up smoking today. I already know this. Haven't caved yet, but this is too hard right now and I don't think I can do it. Eyes stinging with tears as I type this. Want to give in, don't want to give in. No one else to tell. Will reset badge if I start smoking again.

**Update:** Thanks for the encouragement everybody. I messed it up today, but I learned an important lesson. I smoked and the anxiety was not alleviated. At all. I think I needed to know that to break the association. Problems with anxiety may have been why I started in the first place, but nicotine doesn't alleviate it. It simply exacerbates the problem. Lesson learned. Thanks so much for the support and encouragement and I'll be sad to see my number back at 1 tomorrow.

P.S. I just reset my badge and requested a new start date for tomorrow. I still feel like I quit 42 days ago...this was a setback but nicotine will *not* win.

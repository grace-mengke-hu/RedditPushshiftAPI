Whatever you do, don’t take another puff!

I had quit for 28 days.  I’ve been out of work for 16 months and had interviewed for a position I would love to land.  However, I’ve heard nothing back from them when I was supposed to, I got stressed out and caved in and smoked a cigarette.  I couldn’t stop for about a week.  I’ve quit again and today is Day 5 and the fight with cravings is worse than when I quit the first time.  They are driving me insane.  Instead of worrying and stressing about whether I’ll hear from them, I’m applying for more opportunities.  Let’s face it, it’s a heck of a lot more productive than killing myself 5 minutes at a time by smoking a cigarette!

quit smoking 2+ months ago, still suffering

I have smoked for the last 12 years. Before quitting I was smoking 2+ packs per week. I used to smoke more. I am 30.

I think the last time I smoked a cigarette was back in late September. I only smoked 5/6 cigarettes in the month of September.

I am suffering from two issues:

1. I feel like I can't breathe properly, I have to put extra effort while breathing. Not always, but sometimes.

2. My ability to concentrate on anything is not what it used to be.

I am not using any alternative source of nicotine or e-cigs. My question is, how long will it take for my problems to alleviate. I am finding it extremely difficult to perform at my work.

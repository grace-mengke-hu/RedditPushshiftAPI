1 week down, the rest of my life to go!

First week and it's a lot easier than I thought it would be. Staying active and keeping a healthy diet in mind is definitely helping. Although typical marine corps stress has made for some intense cravings, (and it doesn't help that 90% of the marines at my shop smoke) I've managed to get that first week out of the way. Just wanted to share this so that if anyone who is deciding on taking the leap, it IS doable! 

Thanks for all the support and motovation on this subreddit, you guys are awesome.

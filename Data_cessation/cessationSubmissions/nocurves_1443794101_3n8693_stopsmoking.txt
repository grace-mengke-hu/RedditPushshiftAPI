22 days

I don't know what my counter says, if anything, as I'm on mobile. But I am at 22 days as of this morning. This subreddit helped tremendously, I read this and whyquit almost all day my first few days. Now it's a bit easier. It seems like free cigarettes are everywhere now that I don't smoke!! I don't get it. Staying strong though. I'm only 23, so if I keep my quit, my chances of getting a healthy body back are hopefully pretty good!!! That's what I want.. To someday not have smoking related illnesses in the back of my mind.

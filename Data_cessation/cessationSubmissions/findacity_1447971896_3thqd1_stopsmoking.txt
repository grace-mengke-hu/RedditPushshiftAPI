How long did you experience cravings?

Hi there. Three week non-smoker (well, two and a half.) The first week was easy, I felt good about my decision and it was freeing to not feel like i had to smoke every time i went outside. The second week is when I started having stronger cravings. I used to really look forward to when I could escape a stressful party or whatever and have my cigarette, or I'd bribe myself with a cigarette to run a tedious errand. Now these are the only times I really miss smoking. Other times I can think about it and I won't even feel tempted. So how long until I just don't think about smoking?

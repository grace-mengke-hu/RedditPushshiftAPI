Tough night, but I found a technique that really helped the toughest hour: timing my cravings.

I read somewhere that cravings only last 3 minutes, there's only so many cravings per hour, and quitters experience severe difficulty measuring time passing. So when I was having really bad cravings for what seemed like an hour, I decided to just set a stopwatch and write down every time I really wanted to go outside and smoke. I continued watching a movie and working on a craft project. 

I didn't feel the 3-minute rule to be true, but every time I wrote down the time, I felt satisfied in some way, like now that it was documented I didn't have to think about it anymore. It was also nice to see how many cravings had passed without me caving in. 

Within an hour and seven minutes, I had 15 cravings, some within 2 minutes of each other and some within 6 minutes. After an hour and a half, I stopped timing because the cravings stopped.

I recommend doing this if you feel like you're going to cave. An hour and seven minutes isn't really that long. 

Also, funny thing, the movie I was watching was Dead Man, which I'd never seen before. It takes place in the Wild West and throughout the movie several people ask the main character if he has any tobacco, to which he replies "I don't smoke." It was nice to hear that repeated. Plus I got to be reminded of how shitty it is when you want to smoke and you can't, making it feel good to be a quitter :)

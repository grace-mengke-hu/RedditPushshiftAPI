I think I'm done...

I took my first drag at least 25 years ago, and it's been an on again/off again battle ever since. At the height of my addiction, I was smoking two packs of full-flavors a day. 

I've tried before, and eventually failed every time. I tried patches and gum, and kept smoking on top of them. I quit for a couple of months with Chantix, but the stress of a marriage ending had me smoking a pack a day in no time. 

I'm a medical professional. I know the risks of smoking. These days, everyone knows the risks. Whenever I smoke, I feel stupid, and whenever I try to quit, and fail, I feel weak and pathetic. 

I even been smoking a pack a day of light menthol for at least three years. I smoke the Camel crush menthol, because they're the most menthol I can get. 

This weekend I started vaping. It's now Sunday night, and this pack-a-day guy just smoked the last cigarette in a pack that was purchased and opened Friday morning. 

I'm done. I quit. My daughter is 13,and I want to be able to walk her down the  aisle someday. I want to be able to spoil my grandchildren, when they come. I'm 37... I have so much I still want to accomplish... 

I know it's a hard road. It's a road I've started down before. I'm going to make it this time. He'll, even if I stumble, I can get back up. 

I'm kind of scared.

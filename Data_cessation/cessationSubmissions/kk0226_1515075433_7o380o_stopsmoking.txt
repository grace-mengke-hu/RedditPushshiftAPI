60 Days as a NONSMOKER!

I would have had no idea 3 months ago that today I would be on day 60 as a NONSMOKER!  One day it just clicked, I put them down and I haven't picked them back up.  There have been hard days and moments but I haven't given in and I won't give in!

I've taken extreme ownership of my quit and hold myself 100% accountable of my actions... It isn't easy but it can be done!  Once you make the decision it's up to you and you can do it!  Congratulations and good luck to everyone starting their quits, you've got this!

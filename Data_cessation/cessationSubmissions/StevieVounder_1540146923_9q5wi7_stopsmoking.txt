3rd attempt this year

Tomorrow I'm going to make my third attempt to quit this year. First, I quit from Jan - Jun, second was for 2 weeks in August, and now I'm going to try and make it stick! They say on average it takes 8 times and I'm on my 8th since I started. I've read the books, got no-nicotine replacements, and a supportive community to help. Wish me luck!

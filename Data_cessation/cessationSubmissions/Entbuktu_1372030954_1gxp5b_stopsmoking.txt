Very active people, what were the physical effects for you?

I was a 5 year pack-a-day smoker and I quit about 45 days ago- I noticed almost no physical changes (I should say the mental changes were apparent and awesome). Did anyone else have the same experience? I essentially do about 50-55 hours of moderate cardio a week (for my job).
I was excited to go through the physical changes but not much happened.

The only things I noticed were: Muscles are a slightly less achey, bit more energy in the morning, and my hair got more shiny and more ~*fabulous*~

And that's about it. No cough or lung changes that I can tell. Everything else feels the same. I was almost disappointed to not cough up awesome chunks of black tar :(

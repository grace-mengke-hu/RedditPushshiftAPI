Advice for someone surrounded by smokers

I am 6 days smoke free! I recently came down with an awful cold and realized I hadn't smoked in 4 days. I said you know what i'm done and haven't smoked since and honestly I don't want to. My question is how do you stay strong when you are surrounded by smokers. My girlfriend smokes, my parents smoke, my friends smoke. I am not pushing everyone to quit around me, though it would be nice.  But how do you deal?

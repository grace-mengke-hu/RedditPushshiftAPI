Anyone Still Miss it?

I've been smoke free for a little over a year now, slowly decreased the amount of smokes over the course of a month and haven't had a cigarette since. the first few months were tough, lots of cravings and the occasional mood swing but with the help of a rubber band I was able to fight the cravings. the hardest part was breaking the ritual smoke break. I decided that instead of trying to fight that I would transform the smoke break into a Coffee break. instead of walking around the building with a Dart in my hand I would have a coffee. after all of the cravings, the fighting, and the struggle, I am proud to say I am smoke free. yet every time the smell of a fresh cigarette hits me, I think of smoking fondly, I miss it. 

anyways I just felt like sharing.

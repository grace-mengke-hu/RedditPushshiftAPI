Day 13, doing pretty well. Question about vaping

Hi everyone, 


It's been almost two weeks since I had my last ciggie. I was doing a meditation retreat for 10 days so these first days were very easy, but now that I came back to the real world it's getting a bit harder.


I resist cravings etc, I get very angry sometimes, not taking it out on anyone but I really fume inside, at least once a day. And also, the hunger. The freaking hunger. I am insatiable. I can eat all day without stopping, I'm a bottomless pit, really. Never knew it could be this bad.


So, I'm thinking of getting a vape with 0% nicotine juice for a while. To help me in social situations, have something to do with my hands, hand to mouth gesture etc... And maybe eat less. But I don't wanna swap an addiction for another, so my question is : does vaping create a strong psychological dependance? I wanna use a vape until I feel I'm completely free from cigarette temptations. Is it hard to give up vaping when that point is reached?


Sorry in advance for th terrible formatting, I'm on mobile.

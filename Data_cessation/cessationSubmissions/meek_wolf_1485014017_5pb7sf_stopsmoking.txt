Relapsed after 3 years without a smoke.

So I've been smoking for about 5 years, then after 5-7 tries I managed to stop (cold turkey). 3 years without a single puff passed and maybe 4 months ago for whatever reason I tried a cigarette. Was convinced that I wouldn't start again. Fucking pride. I've been smoking a pack per day since, but now I'm quitting again. The last time I quit, it was the hardest thing I've done in my life and I feel so miserable that I came back to day 0. I know the struggle ahead of me, but I will not stop until I'm smoke-free again. Good luck to everybody who is on the same journey and stay healthy <3

Has anyone made themselves a deal?

I have 3 cigarettes left in my pack and I'm going to try my hardest to quit after those which will be tonight. I told myself if I can make it a year I'm going to buy myself something. I intend to save what I spend on cigarettes daily and transfer that money into another account, then at the year mark use that money to by myself a new toy.

In Australia on 73 hours, it has been a huge 3 days I can tell you that

Firstly the way I decided I was going to quit was on thursday night at around 10pm in the shower, I was having a durry and was legitimately like in my head "fuck this, I wish I could go out and not have the craving to smoke" and finished it and said it was my last one. Friday night comes and I decide to stay in for my first day, saturday night comes and I go out and get absolutely blind but don't smoke. Today (sunday) I am happy that I didn't smoke and have work from 2-10pm where I am used to going on smoke breaks every 2 hours or so and then having 2 on my break but I didn't smoke not today, that is the old me. It comes to 10pm and I'm off and offer to drive a smoker friend home. He offers me a smoke and asks if he could smoke in my car, I respectfully decline the ciggy but let him smoke in my car. 



I am genuinely proud of myself, something I don't think I've ever felt before. I think it will stick this time and am not evening hoping because I know it's up to me this time. Although I am hoping that the cravings will ease up sooner rather then later. Anyway I want to thank this sub first of all because I have a long way to go but whenever I feel weak I just think of all the successful people on this sub that have done it. So thank you

Got sick, decided to quit

Had my last fag around 9:00 a.m. yesterday, Sunday morning. Have had a pretty nasty throat/nose sickness for the past few days and after powering through about a pack of cigarettes decided that this is just BS. Smoking just for the sake of smoking, actually not enjoying every puff from light to extinguish. Been wanting to quit for SOME time now, so decided to use this period of extreme distaste to hopefully boost through the first few horrid days of nicotine withdrawal. It's been going well, only a few strong fits of wanting. Downloaded some quit smoking apps, I like seeing the heath benefits progress. 

Anyway - wish me luck! From past experience I can say for certain the more replies/stories/attaboys/advice/etc I receive the more likely I will be to continue on smoke free. So go for it - even if it's only a one word reply!

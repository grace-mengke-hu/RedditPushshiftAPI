Day Five feel Alive!

Day 5 just making sure I do the work meditate breath and remember that the thoughts of smoking aren’t real they are just one of 70,000 thoughts I have a day and it doesn’t define me and it isn’t real. So I was thinking of doing a detox cleanse to flush the toxins out faster, was considering the lemon detox diet cleanse. Any thoughts?

100 days!

Today, I have not smoked for 100 days! I am so proud of myself. Its been hard. Really hard.  I have cried, sniffed ashtrays (how pathetic) shouted, been withdrawn and moody, laughed, dreamed about smoking, told a stop smoking advisor to go f**k herself and that she was incompetent (she told me I should start using some gum or patches as I was struggling at 3 weeks), sobbed, burst with pride at myself, cried some more, looked longingly at cigs behind the counter of shops for so long that the shop assistant asked if I was ok, bored my friends, felt unbelievably sad, followed smokers smoking (I looked like a stalker) and eaten my own body weight in food on a daily basis, over the  last 100 days. I have smoked for almost 25 years, smoking about 20 a day. This is the hardest thing I have ever done: but as the quote by Winston Churchill says "If you are going through hell.. keep going".

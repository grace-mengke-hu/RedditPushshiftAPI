Just smoked my last cigarette in my entire life

And you know what? This decision makes me feel good actually. 

I've been a smoker for about 4 years now. Always thought it made me feel better when going through stressful periods of my life and that it was nice to smoke, but yesterday I just had the thought "Does it even make me happy at all?" 
I came to the conclusion that no, it doesn't make me happy at all. Even though I'm going through one of the most stressful periods of my life so far, smoking does not at all make me happy. I came to the realization that it's actually a really disgusting habit.

I know it's gonna be a tough ride because I have two parents that have quit smoking and I have seen the effects it had on them the first couple of weeks. But I'm very determined to go through this. 
Never again. I'm not gonna be a slave of nicotine any longer.

So now I join the ranks of the non-smokers. I've actually lurked around for a while and found that this community is very supporting and great so I wanted to be part of it for my journey. Wish me luck! 

Also, I'm currently losing weight and I know that it's inevitable to not gain a few pounds in this process. I just wanted to know if anyone had any tips or advice for keeping the weight gain to a minimum? 

Edit: Also any advice on how to cope with cravings? Planning to just quit cold turkey so if anyone has any advice on that part, it would be greatly appreciated!

And last: Hello /r/stopsmoking! We will make this journey together!

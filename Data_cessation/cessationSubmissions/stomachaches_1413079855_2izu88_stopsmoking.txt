quitting in eleven days!

i'm currently trying to quit in eleven days time -- my partner asked me to not smoke any cigarettes starting on their birthday (the 22nd) and after some consideration, i agreed. i'm fairly young, and i've only been smoking newports for about a year, but i know that i'm hooked, and being overweight as it is surely isn't going to help the health problems i know i can develop in a few years time if i keep up with the habit.

i smoke half a pack to a pack and a half a day (depends on my stress levels, if i'm going to concerts -- i'm a huge concert goer, and oftentimes queuing is terribly boring, so i chain smoke as a result), and i know this is going to be hard. i'm unemployed at the moment, and i stay home and watch over my great grandmother -- she's 101 and needs care around the clock, and i watch her during the day while my grandmother is at work. i was inspired by a lot of stories on this sub, and i hope i can share my success with all of you. i plan on quitting through willpower alone, because i'd rather not be hooked on an e-cigarette, nicotine patches, gum, any of that. there'll be a few hellish weeks ahead of me, but i look forward to ridding myself of this habit :)

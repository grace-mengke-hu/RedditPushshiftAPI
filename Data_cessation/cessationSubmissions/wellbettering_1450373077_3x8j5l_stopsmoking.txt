Day 19: I can't focus and keep finding myself irritable and moody

After a binger over Thanksgiving weekend, I decided it was finally time to quit smoking (about a pack a day for 3 years).  A lot of my friends have had success with Nicorette or vaping, but I didn't want a nicotine substitute and am just going cold turkey.  I'm on day 19 and find that I'm terribly moody.  I can't seem to focus to organize my day/life.  I keep thinking about a recent breakup, forced and estranged relationship with dad, thinkings I'm guilty/shameful of.

Does anyone else experience this?  How do you cope? How long does it last?

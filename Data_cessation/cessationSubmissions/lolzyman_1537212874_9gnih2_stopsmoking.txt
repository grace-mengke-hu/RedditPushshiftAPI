Almost threw away six months, what do I do now

Six months without a cigarette and I almost smoked one. We were out and a friend offered one which I accepted and almost lit (the lighter was close) before sense prevailed and I threw it away. While I am happy that I threw it away I am still shocked that it went so far.

I am still missing cigarettes, most days are still a struggle and sometimes I feel life is incomplete without them. I know this isn't true but I cant shake off that feeling. I don't want to feel like this anymore and I need your help with it.

Cigarettes as a crutch for anxiety

Hello redditors. On mobile here, so, sorry for any and all annoying formatting or errors.
Here's the scoop: I'm a 27 year old Husband and Father of 3. I recently quit smoking, finally finding it in me to do it for myself and no one else. I had been nicotine free for 2-2 1/2 months. The problem is that running into marital problems combined with my anxiety makes for an awful concoction inside of me that drives me to smoke beyond any reasoning. I used to tell myself "why pick up smoking again? Why waste all of this effort?" And now I cannot go a day without buying a pack, even if I don't smoke them all(I've run two almost full packs under water, only to become overwhelmed with anxiety and rush out to get another pack)

Do any of you have experience with this type of Crutch-Smoking? If so, what are some alternatives you've found to deal with anxiety that relieves the urge to smoke?

Thank you for your time.

reached the four month mark!

This is supposed to be exciting to me, because I'm at a new school, finals week is starting, and I haven't touched a cigarette in four whole months. I think part of the reason is that I haven't had a job in four months either, and so money has been severely limiting. While I'm glad that I haven't had a smoke, the longest I've ever gone since I started smoking at 18, I still miss it. I just want to take a few long drags in between classes, and end my day with a cigarette. I didn't smoke socially, and I spend most of my time away from my peers during the day that I still feel strange without a cigarette while I'm waiting for my next class, or waiting for a bus, or walking to my destination. I don't have the physical cravings, but in my minds eye, I still feel like I need the sensation of it.

KA-POW! One week!

In part thanks to this subreddit, I've now spent over 168 hours without smoking a single cigarette! Thank you!

Yesterday, I had friends over. We had beer and wine, and drank and talked, and occasionally someone went into my kitchen (now the only place I allow people to smoke. With the window open, of course) and I never once went with them, even just to be near the smoke (which actually smells pretty foul, even through the closed kitchen door). I didn't even pay the smokers much mind, other than two or three short blips in my brain, going: "Come on, just one while you're drunk. You could just share one with a friend, and tomorrow it'll be all good!" But I quickly turned my thoughts to the conversation at hand, and I'm majorly proud of myself today: A big trigger has been vanquished! I know I've just won this battle, but not the next battle... And the next battle... And the next battle... I'm just proud to have taken the first step towards removing my social triggers. 

Even at university this week I have never felt the need to go outside and smoke between seminars, which I, of course, used to do every chance I got (I got addicted to smoking during those breaks... I used to have a "Every third time" rule back then... pretty stupid of me). I often thought about it, whenever a seminar or lecture ended, but it was pretty easy to say "no, I'm a non-smoker, remember?" And then it was all good. It really is that easy at the moment!

The Stench!

Two months ago, I never really thought about how stinky cigarettes were. I mean, I smoked twenty of them a day so the smell was stuck to me and I didn't remember life without it.

These days:

* If someone driving in front of me is smoking, I can smell it.
* The smell of a put-out cigarette is absolutely horrendous. It almost makes me gag.
* Cigarette smoke lingers, as some of you may know. My brother moved my car this morning and had a cigarette with him. I got into my car a couple hours later and the smell was still there.

Stale cigarettes stink! So for all you people trying to quit, don't be stinky! Be sexy! You can do it!

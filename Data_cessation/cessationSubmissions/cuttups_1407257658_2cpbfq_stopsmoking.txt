I know all the arguments. I just really want one.

Its been over a month and I went from feeling good about it to being really anxious and craving a cigarette.  I've been rereading the Allan Carr book and I keep thinking "yeah yeah yeah...".  I know the points he is making and I know how the cigarettes are affecting my life but even still, I just want one more than ever.  It seems like I went from caring about quitting to not caring and I don't know why.

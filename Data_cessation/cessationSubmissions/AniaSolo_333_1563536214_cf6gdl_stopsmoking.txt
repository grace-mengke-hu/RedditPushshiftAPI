I was doing so well...

I was about to hit 3 weeks smoke free, and then I smoked about 5 cigarettes last after getting really drunk. I was feeling so good about my quit and I stopped thinking about cigarettes for the most part. I really thought I had made it through the worst. But then I just drank way too much I guess. I should be able to drink however much I want without smoking. How can I get to that point? I've heard a lot of mixed advice about whether one should avoid their big triggers, or just face them head on. What do you guys think? 

The other thing is that I really don't want to reset my counters. Having a lapse doesn't undo all of the work I've done, but at the same time it makes me really sad seeing "19 days smoke free" and knowing that it's not true. Where do I go from here?

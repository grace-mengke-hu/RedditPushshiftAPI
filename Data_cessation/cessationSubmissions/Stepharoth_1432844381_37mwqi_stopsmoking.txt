New here... yay.

In an effort to be less sarcastic in general, I wanted to first say thanks to the mods of this sub. Really great to have extra resources at your fingertips that go beyond just words on a page.

At first I wasn't sure how anyone could fathom typing on this subreddit while going through nicotine withdrawals, because every simple task has been excruciatingly difficult for me today. Here’s my week so far, completely nicotine free:

* First day – Fine.
* Second day – Fine.
* Third day – Fine, if suspicious.
* Fourth day – Great morning, until my inner critic sent me into a prolonged negativity party at work. Later, because of an impromptu sobbing fit in my car, I was unable to go to choir practice (my first, and most important rehearsal; how nice to have missed it). Oh, and I screamed at a homeless person asking me for money and blocking my way out of the building while leaving work.
* Fifth day (today) – One of the more miserable days of my life, if only because I have to pretend to smile at work and be normal. Spent most of the morning crying in the bathroom because every little thing I’ve been worrying about for the past 2 years has surfaced inside my head tenfold. It's about every 30 minutes of tearing up at my desk, now. At least I'm lucky enough to be a cube monkey with little amount of bother from coworkers. I’ve officially romanticized starving myself for the entire week because "what does it matter anyway"? I stabbed a big hole through my notepad while on the phone with a salesman.

I'm not above rational thinking, however. Talked through a possible solution for missing my music theory lesson tonight, but damn if I wasn't a nervous wreck before. And there's nothing saying I won't feel like absolute shit for missing out on two music things this week already. Food still tastes meh unless I have some herbal help (it's legal where I live), but this sure beats the 24/7 nausea I had for a month leading up to this 0 cigarette time frame.

Don't know why I posted this. Cry for understanding I guess; words mean little and I feel like I'm in a fog of stupid and emotions. I'd link a Ron Burgundy picture if I didn't think I'd look like a moron for doing it.

Thanks be to this subreddit for receiving my offerings of rambling. I sense a great harvest in our future.

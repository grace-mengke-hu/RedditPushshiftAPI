day 10, sort of

I've currently been Cigarette free since June 23rd, and I had been smoking for around 3 years. I've tried countless times to quit in the past 6 months, I've thrown away too much money and countless packs of half full cigarettes.

I've finally managed to reach go over a week without a cigarette, however I didn't quit cold turkey and have been chewing 9 or 10 pieces of Walgreen's brand nicotine gum. I'm kind of worried that I could have traded one addiction for another, but I also don't want to stop chewing the gum because I'm afraid that if I cut myself off I'll find myself throwing away another pack of cigarettes in short time.

Does anybody have any experience in quitting with this type of gum before? Am I simply delaying the inevitable Nicotine withdrawal once I cut myself off from the gum?

I didn't think I would make it..

I've made it 8 days and the thoughts of having a smoke have dropped off significantly. I smoked for 14 years and just had enough.  I'm so happy I'm finally done smoking. 

A quick question though - I cant stop taking deep breaths and always feel out of breath. How long does this typically last?

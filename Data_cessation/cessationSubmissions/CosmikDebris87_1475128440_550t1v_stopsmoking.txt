Turning to reddit for advice

I have been smoking since I was 16, some 13 years ago and aside from the constant and very short lived "I'm quitting" periods have smoked heavily during this time. Today I stop. Any first day advice would be very much appreciated. I guess I'm here really because almost everyone I know is a smoker and are far from helpful. You complete strangers however... Thanks in advance

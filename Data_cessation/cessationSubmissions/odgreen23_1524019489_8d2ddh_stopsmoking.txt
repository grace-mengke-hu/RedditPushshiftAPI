How to help boyfriend quit smoking

Hi guys! So my boyfriend of about 3 months just told me he wants to try and quit smoking. He knows I don’t like it but I have never asked him to stop for me, but he told me that he wants to for me. Any tips on supporting him through this? I told him I don’t expect him to do that for me and there’s no pressure. He also dips, so I’m assuming he’ll do that quite a bit more when he tries to quit. I’ve never really known someone well who smokes or has tried to quit besides him and I just want to make sure I can make it as easy as possible for him!

12 hours in and this is a lot easier than I thought!

I finished Allen Carr's EASYWAY this morning. As soon as I finished, I smoked my last cigarette and focused on the taste and the sensation of it. I almost gagged several times during that last cigarette, but I forced myself to finish it, just like the book said to. I thought it would be so much more difficult going through my work day with out running out for a smoke. I though that because I had a monotonous desk job that so would have nothing to focus on but cigarettes. While my mind did turn to cigarettes a few times, it was always how excited I was that I hadn't smoked a cigarette in X hours. I have tried quitting in the past and the first 12 hours were always torture. Now I can't help but marvel at how fast the day has gone. I never would have learned about the Voodoo/Black Magic/Supernatural Cosmic Fuckery that is Allen Carr's book of it wasn't for all of the lovely people in the subreddit. Thank you all! I am finally a non-smoker!

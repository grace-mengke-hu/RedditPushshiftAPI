100 days in and just one issue.

It's been 100 days and everything is going great. The only "problem" I've had is driving. I smoked since the day I got my license 15 years ago and I always had a cigarette in hand while driving anywhere. Now that I've stopped, I'm bored out of my mind while driving. One positive thing is it's actually lessened my road rage a bit when I see someone drifting in their lane or not keeping a constant speed; rather than get angry I just assume they're bored as shit too and not paying attention. Luckily I only have a 15 minute drive to work each day but I have a 4 hour solo trip coming up I'm not looking forward to. I'm not worried I'll buy smokes, I'm just wondering what non-smokers do to occupy themselves. I usually have sunflower seeds handy at any given time, even before I quit, and there's always the radio I guess. Is that it? Obviously watching the road is important, but I've got several hours of two lane highway with nothing but trees to look at. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

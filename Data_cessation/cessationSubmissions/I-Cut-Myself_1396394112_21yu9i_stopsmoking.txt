Gonna quit but scared, any advice?

Started only smoking when drinking in the bars because it was a way to pass the time and socialize, but 2 months ago i started smoking every day after i started back in college because everyone smoked.
Dont want to smoke anymore, dont wanna be a smoker in 10 years etc.
But i have a very addictive personality and habit controls my life..
What should i expect?

I smoked tonight...

I had a few drags tonight. My friend offered me a cigarette and I instinctively said yes. I'd usually be able to say no but I've been feeling a bit self destructive and I dropped my guard. I won't be resetting my badge because I don't think that will be helpful to me. I'll just say, don't get complacent and keep your guard up. I had a few drags and I regret it, it was disgusting. Keep going :)

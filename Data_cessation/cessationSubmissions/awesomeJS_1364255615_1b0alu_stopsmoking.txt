I'm quitting today, on my 19th birthday. 

I have been a smoker for almost 4 years and never really thought about it. Today I found out that I live in a house full of radon, plus I quit my job last Thursday so I won't afford to buy cigarettes, and I have a terrible cough that just won't go away. I'm done with this holding me back.

My birthday seems like a good day to quit. But I will need your help. Tell me your story! :D

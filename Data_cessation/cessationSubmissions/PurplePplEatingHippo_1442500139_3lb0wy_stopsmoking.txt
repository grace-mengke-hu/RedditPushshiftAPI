Why is this so darn hard?

Long time lurker of this sub, and its finally dawned on me that I need to give up this habit. I'm 21yrs old and I sound damn close to how my old man sounds every morning and he has been smoking for 30+ years. As I'm typing this right meow I'm smoking my last cig and throwing my pack out.

I'm hoping that I will have the mental resolve to finally put down the cigs after smoking a pack a day off and on for the last 5 years. I'm sick of smelling like this, trying to figure out how certain foods taste, and wasting my hard earned money on these things. My first goal is to not have touched a cig by this time tmrw. 

See you guys tmrw, and I'll be 24hrs smoke free then to.

Just bought a vape

I just treated to/invested in myself and bought a vape. I started smoking on study abroad because I'm in a place where there is literally zero stigma to smoking and I was slightly depressed. I realized how much I was hurting myself by smoking (half a pack a day, luckily for only like 2 months) and just bought a vape. This thing is kind of stupid looking, but I needed some kind of financial incentive to quit if that makes sense. Does anyone have any tips for using a vape to quit smoking?

Things you like to do instead of smoking?

Hello all! So I've made it 80 days now and feeling fantastic overall, however I'm dealing with a lot of stress and anxiety issues in my life at the moment and although I'm not craving to smoke I'm still kind of at a loss about what to do during the times I would usually light up to "calm myself". 
Just interested in seeing what kind of things others and have used to help with stress since quitting :) 
Thanks everyone!

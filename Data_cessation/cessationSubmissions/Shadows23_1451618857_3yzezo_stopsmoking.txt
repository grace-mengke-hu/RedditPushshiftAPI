I need some support in quitting.

I started the patch two days ago, and ive still smoked 3 or 4 cigarettes a day. I am feeling desperate like nothing will make me quit. I want to quit but i question whether i really want to or not since im really struggling to. If you've quit what helped you? I could use some encouragement and suggestions. Thanks.

Thankful to Allen Carr

I quit three days ago and have no desire and don't miss smoking.  I have become a non smoker without replacing it with something else.  I watched the webcam because I didn't want to wait for the book.  Best money I ever spent.  If your trying to quit or suffering after quitting I really recommend Allen Carr's Easy Way to Quit Smoking.  Really amazing!

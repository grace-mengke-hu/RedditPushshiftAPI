Depression exactly at 3 weeks

So as my title says.  I quit snus Swedish tobacco.  I hope it's ok I post here.  I'm so happy I quit no more withdrawal.  I woke up exactly at 3 weeks super depressed and skipped my work out and just stayed in.  I woke up today depressed, but did my work and started going about my day.  Is this normal for people?

difficult times

A friend (that quit 6 months ago) told me that between weeks 3 and 6 was the hardest time for him. After that it became much better. 
I must say I have the same issue right now. I am 3 weeks in and is more difficult than during the first 2 weeks. Not that I have immediate urges or that I am in accute danger of restatring but it takes a lot of focus right now. Just thought I'd share.

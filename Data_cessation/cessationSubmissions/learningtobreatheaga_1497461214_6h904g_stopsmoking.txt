worst symptom........GO!

what was your worst symptom and how long did it last?

how long and how much did you quit?

i keep hearing you're over the hump the first three days because it's truly an addiction to nicotene, and nicotene is out of the system by day three...... need help with this, thanks reddit.

i am asking these questions because i am the kind of person that needs to be mentally prepared.

An-NOYING dream

I dreamed just now that I was a teen once again (my 5th day not smoking) and had my computer, but a whole fuckton of 13 or  unders came into my room and wanted to play the game console and so forth. I also had a dress picked out for Christmas season that was $6.96 or some odd price. This dress was gorgeous from a China wholesale site. I mean, WTF? Thing was, all I wanted to do was sleep in the dream, too.

Still have the last trace of nicotine left and the aftereffects still washing out. I THINK!

Day 3.5

Didnâ€™t sleep too well last night, think I maybe got a full 3 hours of decent sleep, the rest of the 10 hours spent laying down was cat napping and staring into nothing.  

Woke up with a craving from hell so I made myself a huge cup of coffee and passed an hour slowly sipping it until the craving went away.  Also found some flexibility stretches on YouTube that run about 20-30 minutes, so I stretched through it.  

Then I remembered I downloaded this app called Zombies, Run! And decided to go for a walk.  I highly recommend this app! It drops your right in the middle of a zombie apocalypse and motivates you to get moving.  I walked the whole time, but the sounds of the zombies and of the people talking to me via walker talkies was real enough to keep me going.  

So 2.5 miles down, a nice cold shower later, and my craving finally passed.  

Whoever said cravings last for a maximum of minutes has clearly never smoked.  

Good luck to everyone else!

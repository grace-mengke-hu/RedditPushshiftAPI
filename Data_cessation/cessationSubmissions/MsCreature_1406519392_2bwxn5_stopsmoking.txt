352 days smoke-free and I gave in.

Fuckfuckfuck.

I was doing pretty damn well. Then I went through a series of country-song-level heartbreaks. Even so. I thought I was coping.

I wasn't.

It's the hardest when it's late at night and I'm all alone with me, myself, and netflix. All I want to do is eat, but that makes it fucking worse. I go through phases where all I can think about is smoking. They pass. 

This time it didn't and I finally gave up. I'm so mad, but at the same time.. it's like an old friend who I know will never leave me.

August 8th was my year. The second time I've hit a year. Fuck.

I hate this habit so much, but it's my only vice and I miss it all the time. I wish I never smoked that first pack or ever picked it up the second time.. I don't drink, I don't smoke weed, I don't do drugs. Nicotine is my drug of choice and I love every single aspect of smoking.

I know it's a pure emotional addiction at this point.

Is there no turning back? I've only smoked one and a half cigarettes. Can I fix this?

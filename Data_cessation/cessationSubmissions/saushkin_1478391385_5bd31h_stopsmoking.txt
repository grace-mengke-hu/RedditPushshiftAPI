90 days,much happier, much recommended

I dont miss it, i dont crave it, i couldnt care less about it.
The more time passes the clearer is to me that smoking is just an addiction, hijackin persons mind and theres little to nothing more to it.  
First you consume then it consumes you. Your soul, mind and body. It twists your thoughts and reasoning like an evil manipulating friend. 
I feel better than i have felt in years. Im not only happy but at peace now and thats what i have been missing the most. This experince has opened my eyes to other bad habits that were doing me no good. And i can change things. Its like a superpower. I feel now like a person i want to be and the person therefore i am. :)

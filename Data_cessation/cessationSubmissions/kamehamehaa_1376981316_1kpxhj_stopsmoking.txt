20/8/2013

I'm going to remember the 20th of August 2013 as the day that I let it go. It isn't going to be a struggle, just an act of renunciation for a brighter tomorrow. Smoking has served me well. The cigarette has been a companion to me in the best and worst of times and I am grateful for it. I hope to never see the period that I've been a smoker as negative. I choose to dwell on the growth that has taken place because of and despite this crutch.

I've grown up a little tonight, and I choose to get rid of this unsustainable tool of support. 

Let the healing begin.

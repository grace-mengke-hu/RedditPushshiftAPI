Thanks everyone for the support today!

I have finished my first day back to work! I was only tachycardic from anxiety for the first 4 hours. During the last two I calmed down. Short first day back.

Thank you for all the well wishes, kittens and dolphins! And I had one success today. One of my co-workers wants to quit again and I'm going to share with her the video. Please send me the link again ELI. I promise to save it somewhere this time.

Everyone else at work was more supportive of the fact I quit drinking Diet Coke. And I got a lot of 'Oh I could never quit smoking!'. Did I mention I work in a hospital? I've decided that people are not supportive because they are jealous. :)

Anyway as soon as possible I'm handing in my notice.

Also although I was wearing a laundered uniform; it stunk of cigarettes. It made my eyes water all day. I had no idea I smelled so bad. 

Thanks again!!

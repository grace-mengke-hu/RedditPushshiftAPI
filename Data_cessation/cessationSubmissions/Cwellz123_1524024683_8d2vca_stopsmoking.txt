Day 3 cold turkey off of nicotine

This is my 2nd time quitting.  stopped cold turkey for 8 1/2 months back in February of 2017. Relapsed in November of 2017 and then got back into smoking regularly at the beginning of this year as I was getting sober off of alcohol and a bunch of other hard drugs that I was doing. I got hooked on nicotine again. I quit all my other vices but nicotine is back in my life and I want to end my nicotine addiction as I ended all my other ones. I know the only way to quit for me is cold turkey. I have tried vaping and nicotine gum. They work for a little while until I eventually decided to smoke again. It’s kind of like teasing myself by giving me a little bit of nicotine. Thinking it would be enough to satisfy but as I’m hitting that vape, for some reason, it’s not as satisfying as smoking. Wish me luck guys! The withdrawals fucking suck and my cravings are intense but Ik in the end it will all be worth it.

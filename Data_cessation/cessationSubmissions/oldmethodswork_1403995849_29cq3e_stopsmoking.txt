Another easy day 2, but the cycle never ends

Hi, I was a non-smoker from November 6th, 2012 until last summer in August. Since August, I have occasionally smoked cigars. I don't want to smoke them, but every once in a while I just happen to smoke one. 

I have smoked easily less than half of the days in April, May, and June, and I usually have smoked multiple days in a row, then quit for a few days (generally about 8 or so) then I smoke another, and take a few days off, and then another, etc.

Is this normal? I mean, I know the nicotine is out of my system in about 24 hours after smoking 1 cigar, and maybe after 3 days at the max. So I don't know that I'm addicted to the nicotine. I just get bored and smoking a cigar turns into a good idea. Is this normal? I remember reading The Easy Way to Quit and Allen Carr warned that I am a rare breed that can choose to quit and start up at will and that I will have more problems than just about everybody.

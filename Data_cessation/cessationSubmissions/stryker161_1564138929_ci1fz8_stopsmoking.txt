26 days smoke free!

Hey guys, so this is strange. I was a light smoker from when I first tried it at 16, I'm 20 now. At the beginning I smoked maybe a few times every few months. It got more with time but nothing bad, like maybe max. 3-5 cigarettes a day; way more at parties though, as I would pretty much spent the entire time outside, smoking one after another and talking to people.

Now, on the first of July I went on a three week vacation with family who has no clue I smoke and would probably not tolerate it. I decided that I would just go cold turkey and if I made the three weeks I could just stop forever. I was optimistic until the urges got really, really bad on vacation and I tried to calm myself by deciding to start again once I got home. I gotta admit though that the frequency and the intensity of the urges got way less after two weeks. I had the opportunity to get cigarettes on Monday, which I did. And I smoked. And it made me feel like shit. Cigarettes had always suppressed my mood and maybe had given me a headache but it still had something addicting to it but this experience made me not wanna smoke again.
Unless I was drunk, I couldn't smoke two cigarettes after each other because my circulation would break down. Like I said, I got bad headaches, dizziness and that fun stuff before from only smoking one cigarette but it never made me wanna quit because it felt so good at the same time. 

I just think this is strange because despite not smoking a lot, I was so addicted and the going cold turkey was the worst thing I have ever experienced (might be an exaggeration but yk, it was bad). I don't know how I managed to feel like this about cigarettes but I'll take it and hopefully I'll never smoke again.

If I'm not counting Monday as a relapse, I'm 26 days smoke free!

Also, sorry for the bad format I'm on mobile.

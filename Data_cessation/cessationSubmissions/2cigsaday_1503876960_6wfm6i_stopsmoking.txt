Anyone here only smoke like, 2-3 cigs a day and have a hard time giving those up?

I have a habit of smoking about 2 cigs in the evening to kind of wind-down the day.  I will sit on the porch with my favorite nonalcoholic drink, smoke them, and not get that craving again until the next evening.  rarely if ever any daytime smoking.  I'm trying to give it up but the habit of "winding down with the cigarettes is strong!

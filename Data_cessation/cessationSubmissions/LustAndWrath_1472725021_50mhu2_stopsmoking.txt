Three and a half weeks in and the insomnia starts...

Well, I thought I already got through the rough of it, two weeks ago my withdrawal symptoms were super rough, Anxiety all day, one pretty bad panic attack, Dizziness, confusion, super headaches, it was rough, but finally it all stopped, BUT NOW, I'm having the worst time sleeping, everytime I lay down my heart races and it takes forever to finally fall asleep, and today for whatever reason all day my hands and feet have been sweating non-stop and it's if anything getting on my nerves, anyone else experience this? And if so any fixes? I can't make it stop and it's driving me insane...

Edit: I've noticed if I get distracted and stop thinking about it it pretty much stops until I notice it's stopped and I start thinking about it again and then it starts again, it's like a vicious cycle Q_Q

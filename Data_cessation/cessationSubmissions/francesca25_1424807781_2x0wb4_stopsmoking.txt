Star <3

just wanted to say I can't believe I'm here and I love my new star.

Thanks Mellofox, Theragingclap, Chodeybear, Ktadkins and Jonameq and My_vape_self for helping me get the star. 

I wish I could give some advice but I can't think of much.. I replaced coffee with green tea, I started working out a lot more (weirdly, I don't get tired anymore). A new, better looking body is always a strong motivator. Also I got many phone games like Sudoku or Flow that can keep me focused until cravings go away.

4 weeks!

About 4 hours ago I hit the 4 week mark. I honestly did not think I could be strong enough to make it one week, much less 4. For those of you that are further along- YES! Good job, and keep being awesome. You're the ones giving hope to people like me. If you're LESS than 4 weeks- stay strong. You'll really be surprised how quickly you can put your "weak" moments behind you. I still have cravings *almost* every day... And I'm okay with that. At the beginning I had cravings damn near every 5 minutes. Now, if I have them, it's once or twice a day. I can even drink and spend the whole night outside with smokers! This is a really great place to be, and I couldn't have done it without the people in this sub!

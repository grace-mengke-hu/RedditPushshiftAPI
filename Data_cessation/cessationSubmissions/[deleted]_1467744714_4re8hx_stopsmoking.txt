Passed the two month marker, and the difference is night and day!

Most or all withdrawal pains are gone right now and I'm so happy with my perserverance.

Sure, I still think back about smoking from time to time. Not in that I need to have nicotine, but more about thinking back to the "good times" when I enjoyed smoking. Which, looking at it rationally, are problably just good times anyway, even (or especially) without cigarettes.

I taste and smell so much better, my condition is much better (I've also started training again after some injury issues, so that helps too) and I never have that annoying "I need a smoke" feeling anymore! I feel much healthier (also mentally). 

The withdrawal may suck. But it is so worth it after you have gone through it. 

Good luck in becoming and / or staying smokefree all!

**Thank you for all the positive responses!**

Another milestone reached

Went to a party last night, first one since quitting.  I have to say I was worried I would smoke after too much to drink.  I took an e cig with me just in case. 

But I didn't need it>  No smoking, no cravings and when a few people trooped out to smoke in the cold and wet I pitied them.  And the smell when they came back in - gross.

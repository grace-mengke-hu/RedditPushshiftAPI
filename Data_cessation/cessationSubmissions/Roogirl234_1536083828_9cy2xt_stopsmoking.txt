Bought my last pack yesterday

Yuuup I fell off the band wagon. I made it 8 months without smoking I know I can do it again. Should be done by thurs or Friday.
Going to download the smoke free app. For everyone out there staying strong, I applaud you!! This sub helped me so much in the past and I know it will continue to do so!

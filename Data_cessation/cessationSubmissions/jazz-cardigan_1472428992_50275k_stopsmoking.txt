Day four/almost day five.

Its not getting any easier for me. I still have a huge nicotine withdrawal that feels impossible to Cope with. I havent slept Good for four nights, probably clocked around 3-4 hours Every night. The abstinence is crazy, but i know that i have the willpower to be nicotine free. Im not going to let a drug control me - mind over matter.
I just long for the days Where i Can get a full nights sleep. Where i dont fall asleep at 6 am, and wake up at eight. Its hard, but ill continue to fight and manage all those cravings. Good luck to everyone out there

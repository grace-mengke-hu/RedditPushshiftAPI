Chest congestion / trouble breathing (Day 20!)

I am on day 20 of quitting. 

Anyways, the inside of my chest literally hirts when i breathe through there. And my breath feels short. Did you experience anything like this and when did it go away for you? I still havent coughed much since quitting so could it be that airways still havent cleaned out? Any stories and remedies are appreciated. i tjought these kinds of symptoms go away after a week or two.

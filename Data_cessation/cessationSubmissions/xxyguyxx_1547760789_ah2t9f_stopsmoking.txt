Has anyone ever had this happen?

I'm on the road to quitting by slowly tapering off my number of cigs (from 3-5 a day to 1-2) but the other day I smoked my usual first one of the day right after lunch and something weird happened. I thought I was passing out so I went and laid down. The next hour and a half i couldn't do anything but stare at the ceiling while my heart raced and i focused on breathing. If I tried moving or thinking about anything specifically my vision would get hazy and I'd get all woozy. Sometimes while smoking I'll get a head rush and need a few seconds before I started moving but this was way worse. Now I dont think this was cigarettes alone but I waited 24 hours before I lit up another one and I got a head rush but nothing as intense as the day before. Could this event be explained by smoking or does this sound like something else. I'm prone to anxiety attacks but this wasn't like that, this felt more like a drugged up high thing.

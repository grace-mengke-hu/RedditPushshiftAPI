Will I be fully satisfied or happy again?

Hello all. I am new to the reddit community, but the stop smoking app recommended that I check it out, and I’ve enjoyed it so far. 

I’m looking for a bit of encouragement or support from folks who have quit for a long time. 

Today was the first really nice spring day we’ve had since I’ve stopped smoking. I used to take advantage of these days by grabbing a beer, a book, and my pack of smokes to go sit on my deck and enjoy the weather. Today I sat inside and cried.

I just feel like I can’t enjoy anything anymore. Everything I do would be better with a cigarette. I’m not smoking, but I’m still thinking about it what seems like 24/7. 

I see posts from people who have quit for months or years who still crave and I wonder, is it worth it? Sure, I’ll be healthier and live longer, which is obviously great. No one can contest that. But is it a life worth living if you’re only 90% fulfilled? Would you give those extra days, or months, or even years so that you could really enjoy every moment? 

I’m not sure I can do this. It’s been 25 days, and I just feel miserable. The app (and this page) is making me feel like I should be super happy that I’ve made it this long, but I’m not. 

Am I alone here? 

Is there anyone who has quit for a while who has felt like me? 

TL;DR: I don’t feel happy anymore, and I’m worried that I’ll never feel happiness and freedom that I did as a smoker.

1 year too.

One year ago I decided that I had enough with the cigarettes, that I was tired of being slave of a stupid addiction, that any feeling were a reason to smoke, bored? smoking will be funny, sad? let's punish my own, happy?, dude let's celebrate it with a cigarette!.

I went cold turkey, I saw Allan Carlson video, and I download a few apps to track myself, I do climbing now (and I love it), I lost 20Kg and I feel great and fit.

But what I really love it's the freedom and proud feeling that I get every time I think that I'm a non-smoker now, thank you guys, this reddit really help me and It doesn't matter how bad you are feeling now IT WORTH totally.

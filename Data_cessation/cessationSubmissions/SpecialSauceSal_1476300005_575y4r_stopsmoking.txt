462 days strong and suddenly I want one?!

I've had little cravings here and there since the big quit, but today has been rough. I got a wave of anxiety coming into class because the way we were reviewing for our study guide was by collaborating in groups instead of going through the study guide step by step. I had to leave because I (incorrectly) assumed I had nothing to offer my group and would just be a drain on the process.

Now I have the strongest craving I've had in a looooong time. I know I can pull through, as I've endured this exact form of stress before and made it just fine, but *man*, I didn't know they could still be this strong well over a year out. The only thing I can do is be productive about it and distract myself by burying myself in my studies.

I'm glad you guys are here. Sometimes I come back just to look at my badge and admire it as something difficult I've accomplished, and am continuing to uphold. It's a lifelong obligation, and I'm sure as hell not going to let myself down.

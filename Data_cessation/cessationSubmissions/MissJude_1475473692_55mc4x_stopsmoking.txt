Quitting Timeline questions

Hi guys!

I'm currently a 15-hours-non-smoker lady!

I've been through about 20-30 more or less serious attempts to stop. I feel confident this time, chewing on an extra strong peppermint gum and thinking about what is going to change during the next days and weeks. I fear the weight gain for I have to lose weight to fit into category on my powerlifting meet.

So.. I want to create a timeline of some sort, just to keep myself going. I mean "in two days you will stop coughing", or "in a week you will realize the food tastes a lot better now" kinda stuff, but neat and beautiful so it feels official and therefore it's hard to break the streak.. get me? Could anyone share their experience (literally anything positive or negative: nails, breath, sex life, patience, reactions of ppl...) in order for me to create an accurate one? Willing to share for sure, if anyone was interested.

I have one additional question, mainly for the ladies: how did your hair improve and in what time? I've been having a looot of trouble with my hair last couple of years and any improvement would be a huge motivation for me.

Thanks a lot!!

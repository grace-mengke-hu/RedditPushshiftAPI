on day 4.

hello all fellow non smokers! i was gunna say fellow quitters but were not giving up or giving in, were giving ourselves a new lease on life! 

it hasnt been as bad as i thought it was going to be. i am a 13 year smoker was at about a pack a day. i got sick and tired of being sick and tired and waking up feeling like absolute death. not able to breathe ever. my girlfriend said to me while talking on the phone that it sounded like i was out of breath while talking to her. well that scared the shit outta me, on top of the fact that i drank a lot as well, i was a complete mess. super depressed and smelled like smoke and felt like a sack of poop every day. i finally broke the cycle on sunday. i feel 100x better already been running and working out every other day. 
 
couple of things i would like to ask and say:
any tips for a newbie on how to manage cravings?
im taking 4mg nicotine lozenges about 3 a day right now.

 i have all the obvious triggers but it hasnt been too bad. i stopped drinking as well. this is the first time in about 10 years i have been completely sober and smoke free and it is amazing. i keep telling my self that every time i want to light up. 

ive heard a lot of people say to get alan carr's book so ill probably do that. ive been cooking a lot to occupy my time. its been amazing how much shit i can do when im not spending every waking minute not a work drinking and smoking. this is been a pretty monumental couple of days for me and i have a large amount of support which helps. this will be my 3rd and final attempt to quit. i keep correcting my self when i say i am trying to quit to **i AM quitting smoking cigarettes*

any comments and any support is greatly appreciated! i will not smoke with you today!

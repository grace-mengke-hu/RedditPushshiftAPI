Today has been the hardest

Today is only my 5th stopping using patches.  I decided to go to sleep last night without a patch just to try it out and at about 530 this morning I was already showered and in uniform for work and I had the biggest craving and almost caved and bought a pack.  I got through it and put a patch on, I guess I'm not ready to go without them.  Anyway, thank you r/Stopsmoking,  I'm still going strong. Have a good day all

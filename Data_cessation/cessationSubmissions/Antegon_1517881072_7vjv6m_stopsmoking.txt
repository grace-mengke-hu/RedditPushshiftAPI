Does it count?

Today was it, I just decided smokes were dumb (after a pack a day for 19 years mind you).  I'm pretty sure I can't cold turkey it, so I'm attempting it with lozenges.

If you have any tips or wisdom looking back from a quitters prospective feel free to share.

Hopefully this time it sticks. (And hopefully I can wean myself off the lozenges a short while from now!)

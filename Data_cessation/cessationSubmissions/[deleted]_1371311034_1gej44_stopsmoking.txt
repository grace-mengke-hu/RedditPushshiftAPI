A sure sign I made the right choice

Last night I went out to a neighborhood pub with a few friends. It was my first night out since I pledged to quit my social/light smoking habit 6 days ago. Before we went out, I told them I why I had quit and my plan to remain smoke-free. After we ordered our food and drinks, an older gentleman neighbor of theirs invited himself to sit down at our table. At first I was annoyed--he was telling stories, cutting into our conversation, eating our pizza, and we hadn't seen these friends in a while. The guy was clearly lonely though, so we humored him to be polite. 

Then the old guy mentioned how much he misses his partner, who died 5 years ago after 45 years together. "The smoking is what took him in the end." My friend leaned over to me and said, "if that's not a sign that you made the right choice, I don't know what is." Damn right.

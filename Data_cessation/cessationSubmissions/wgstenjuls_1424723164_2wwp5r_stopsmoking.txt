I'm quitting for the second time, and I need help not becoming my worst self.

I'm quitting smoking again, as of today. I quit for 2.5 years, from September 2010 to July 2013.  Last time, I quit with the patch. My problem is that when I'm not smoking, I'm short-tempered and anxious. It wasn't just during the nicotine withdrawal stages; I was short-tempered and more anxious for two and a half years. I don't want that. I want to be smoke free and not feel like a head case.

Any advice?

1 month 14 days. 

thank you all. Never posted here but read yall for inspiration and help. I've done what I use to think would never happen. I realize there is still plenty of time to screw up but now I feel like when I see some one smoking I get a grin knowing I have over come it. I do dip some through out the day but think on Monday I'm done with that too. Everyone just now trying to quit, keep your head up. It's not as hard as you think it is. Once again thank you all and best of luck to everyone starting out this month.

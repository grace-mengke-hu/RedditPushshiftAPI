I hope this works this time

I've tried quiting so many times, and this time I'm actually convinced I can do it. I have not only been helplessly addicted to cigs, but I've been bingeing video games as well. The amount of time games were taking in my life were taking away from my personal life and I wasn't excersizing.

I sold my Xbox because I had no control over my life. Since then I've been planning every days activities the night before and it feel like I have control over my life. While Its only day 2 with no smoking I feel better and for the first time during a quit attempt I feel in control. I always saw quiting as an isolated incident. Stop doing this one thing, but a few days ago I put it together that I smoked because it gave me control in a chaotic life, now I seem to have time to plan and execute my quit attempt. 

Another thing I've been doing that seems to help is recording myself on my phone. The first one I did is just a list of all the reason I want to quit and a challenge. I've played it about 20 times since I recorded it 2 days ago. 

Anyway, I just wanted to put these techniques out there to see if it resonates with anyone... As someone who has tried many different ways to quit I have often looked to others experiences. Wish me luck!

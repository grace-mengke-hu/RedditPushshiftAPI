4 months, $1100 saved.

Today is 4 months with no cigs and I’ve never felt better. I never thought about the money I used to spend everyday smoking. I use the Smoke Free app because I like visually seeing results to help the motivation. As of today being 4 months free I also crossed over the $1100 mark in savings. I’m treating myself to a trip to NYC next weekend (somewhere I’ve always wanted to see during the holiday season) I can’t wait. 

I’m saying all this for the people who are trying to quit today or recently...not only will you feel better about yourself and your health, but there should be motivation in the amount of money you will save too! Good luck.

Trying again...

Hey, I'm Kris and it's time to try again. I got in contact with the tobacco helpline in my state and today is the day I'm supposed to be ready to quit.

But at the same time, will I ever really be ready to quit? I'll be tired of the cough, the smell, and spending the money, but when it comes to throwing away my leftovers and not indulging in my habit, I'm nervous. I've been thinking to myself that if I can quit hard drugs then I can quit this, but this feels harder, and I don't know why. 

I smoke about 7 a day, and when I use an e cigarette I smoke much much more (two packs in a few days). I quit one time for almost a month back in November but I couldn't stick with it. I had a bad craving and I caved. Let's hope that doesn't happen again.

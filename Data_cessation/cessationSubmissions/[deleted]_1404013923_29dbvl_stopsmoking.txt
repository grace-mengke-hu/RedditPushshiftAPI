How long does nicotine withdrawal last (for a non-smoker)?

Being in college, I try to try as many new things as I can, for the most part. The other day, I tried an ecigarette, my friend's. I didn't like it at all. Two puffs (because maybe the first bad puff was just "misleading" apparently) -- both sucked. Now since, I've had some chest pain/tightness and shortness of breath. I figure it has to be nicotine withdrawal. How long does it last? Again, I have absolutely no craving for cigarettes, I didn't like it one bit. I'm just waiting on the physical symptoms to subside.

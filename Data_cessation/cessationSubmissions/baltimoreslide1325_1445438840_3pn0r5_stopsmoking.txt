Need some help starting over during a stressful/busy time

EDIT: Screw it, I'm about to throw out the cigarettes I have here and just start. On the faith that I can somehow figure out how to deal with this trigger before it undoes me. Uh...help appreciated!

Serial quitter here.
My most recent screw up turned into light off-and-on smoking for about a month and of course is now full-blown smoking again (because that's how it works--for any of you considering "just one"--there is never a "just one.")  
My body hates that I'm still doing this to myself and I need to quit, but I'm having a hard time getting the gumption to start again. I'm in the midst of a busy time and don't have the ability to take time off.  
My main trigger is that I work in a creative field and am used to smoking while getting my creative work done. This is responsible for most of my screw ups because my brain thinks a cigarette will make the idea come faster or better.  
Can any of you disabuse me of this stupid notion?  
Have any of you ever quit in a similar situation--busy mental work time, finals week, something like that?  
Right now is an especially busy time, but the thing is that I can't really foresee life getting less busy, and I have to get this over with some time.  
I feel like if I could just fully convince myself that nicotine does not help my work and that nicotine withdrawal doesn't have to seriously affect it, I could power through. Maybe this all sounds totally ridiculous. But triggers are triggers.
Quitters of reddit, tell me how stupid I am! Eternal gratitude in advance.  

TL;DR: Tell me smoking does not make mental or creative work easier?

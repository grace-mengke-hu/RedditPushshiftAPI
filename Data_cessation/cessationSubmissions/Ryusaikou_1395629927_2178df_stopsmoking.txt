I almost failed today. Went for a run instead!

I cant believe im this far in and still getting cravings. Especially as hard as I did. But i have found that a quick hard run may take much longer than a cig but it is equally as effective at controlling myself.

Now only to convince my body that I am craving the run instead of the cigarettes... then I will accomplish my other goals.

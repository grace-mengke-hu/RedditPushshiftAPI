Reason why I'm quitting. At this exact moment.

I've smoked for a while, but very heavily over the past year. If you're reading this, thank you, but in reality I'm making this list for myself. 

* I'm turning 21 soon. I don't want to spend my big night smoking a pack or two because of the scene. 
* I hate kissing my boyfriend right after he smokes. Insteantly kills the mood. 
* I want to be able to taste how awesome my mom's pasta dishes are. 
* I don't want to keep hiding this from my dad.
* I want to be able to sit through my younger brother's **entire** opening day for baseball. 
* I want to stop feeling quilty every time I drop a cigarette out of my car window.
* I want my hair to smell like lavender all day.

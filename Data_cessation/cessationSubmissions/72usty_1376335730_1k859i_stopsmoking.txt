Can i rejoin in?

I've quit properly before for over 120days, but then started the habit when i found my ex had cheated on me several times and my Gran passed away not long after. 
I'm doing it again. I need to quit and it starts today. I'm waiting on my mum to get back and I'm showing her me binning it all!

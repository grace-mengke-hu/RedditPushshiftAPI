This was something I never thought I’d be able to accomplish. I tried so many times to quit smoking and made it a month at best. I had given up and figured I’d be a smoker the rest of my life! Then One day I read Allen Carr’s easy way to quit smoking, and figured I’d try one more time and here I am!

This might not be my first time but it's my last.

It's been 62 days. Do you know what that feels like? Most likely you do, but if you don't, I'll try to put it into words that make some sense.

Imagine waking up every morning and thinking to yourself - where the fuck has all my energy gone, how will I go through this day, what the fuck is going on, where is my head at today.. This is how it was for the first month. 

Good news people, it gets better... OH YESS!

Now I feel calmer than ever, I am glad to be alive each day and I am happy to not be a part of something that kills me slowly each day.

My girlfriend broke up with me over a text message that I dearly loved for a year. My whole family relocated to Europe and I am all alone now. But, If I can do this, so can you. Never give up. NEVER. There is such a beautiful twist to this suffering which you can only experience when you are at the bottom. Which you can really grasp when you are most vulnerable. Keep on keeping on and just take it minute by minute.

I smoked analogs for 7 years and It took everything out of me to do this. I know you can do it too.

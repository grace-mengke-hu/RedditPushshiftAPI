Recently quit..

Wow I have made it this far with out a smoke at all.  Mostly thanks to this sub, thank you all.

I had read carr's book and thought it was ok, but found that Joel Spitzer stuff on whyquit.com was the most helpful.  Course maybe it was me or something in his inflection but I kept waiting for him to say inconceivable.  Anyways his stuff I thought was quite helpful, which I would not have found if it wasn't for this sub.  So again Thank you.

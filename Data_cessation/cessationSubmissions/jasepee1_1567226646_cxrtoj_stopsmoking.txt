120 days of no smoking

I’m 31. I’ve tried to quit unsuccessfully for the last 5 years after smoking half a deck everyday for 6 years. Always going back for a puff and then the cycle starts again. 

I consider it one of my best memories, getting drunk and smoking whilst talking deep conversations with my best friends, especially during the holiday season. It connected us like nothing else. When I stopped buying my own, I thought that it was the end. I bought NRT products to help the cravings but I still couldn’t resist bumming one off my friends every time they went for a cigarette. The guilt I would feel immediately was immense but I just ignored it and pretended this will be the last time, I promise I’ve made hundreds of times. 

Now fast forward to today, For the first time, I don’t crave it anymore. I actually despise the thought of it, even though if I walk past a whiff of someone smoking I still like the smell but thinking what it does to my body makes me so disgusted. Im lucky in a sense that I think I’ve overcome not just the physical addiction but the mental one as well. My sense of smell and taste has increased, I no longer have to leave dinner early just to sneak in a cigarette. I’m more present with the people I talk to, instead of feigning for my next smoke. I can actually smell it on peoples clothes if they’ve gone for a smoke and I think, I used to be like that. 

I know the temptation will always be there. But I honestly don’t want to fuck up my health. Enough is enough and it’s up to me to stop poisoning my body. 

Good luck to everyone out there, not one puff. If you fall, just get back up and try again because your health is the number one priority.

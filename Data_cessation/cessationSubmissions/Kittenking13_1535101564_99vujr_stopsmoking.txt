I have an incredibly low libido, also how do I tell someone I quit for them. Kind of, but not really [nsfw]

So, first I will say I quit on the fourth, I was a smoker of only 2 years, and it’s been interesting. Sometimes I find myself reaching for a vape, sometimes I find myself just staring at my roommates Ash tray. Currently I am far too in to actually go back, but there is still some sort of craving. 

Back when I realized I didn’t have the will to quit, I thought “hey, if I ever find a non smoker that I’m actually into, I’ll quit.” Now, I quit on our first date after we were talking about dealbreakers, he said smoking, I said I quit, never mentioned how recent. This might sound like a really stupid reason, but part of it has something to do with the need to find someone who is gives me the will to better myself. Now how do I say this, bring this up, or do I wait like, a year and bring it up super casually as a joke.

Now, and this is the weird part. I never noticed this, but we started trying to get a lil dirty, and I found that my manly parts aren’t responding, and that’s a tad bit frightening. Now, compared to before, where I was legitimately constantly horny, now I am... not. I didn’t realize I haven’t been since I quit smoking. If anyone knows why or if my sex drive will ever come back that would be nice. I seriously had to spend an hour alone to make things happen and I don’t know if I can deal with that. Anyways, thanks, hope that didn’t get too dirty, I apologize if so.

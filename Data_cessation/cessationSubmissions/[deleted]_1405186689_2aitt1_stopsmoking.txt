Recently Quit!!!

I just celebrated my 18th day cigarette free! My lungs feel great, I am a runner so its far easier to do my workouts. Overall I'm feeling great. It was weird because I have tried to quit so many times before but for some reason this time I was just like no more, this is the end and i've made it so far. Probably the happiest i've been with myself in a while. Good luck to everyone else out there trying to quit. Just remember don't give up. If it doesn't happen today there is always tomorrow :)

Day 19...

Haven't posted here in a couple of days and thought it was time for an update. After 24 years of smoking I'm on day 19 being smoke and nicotine free. Things are going well. I'm cutting back on the Chantix a bit... mostly because it gives me really bad heartburn. I don't feel like I need it much anymore... though I worry that might be a bit of hubris talking. I'm still going to take it... just cutting back a bit.

Emotionally, I've been feeling like... well... a complete loser. I don't know why... but my self confidence is worse... not better. I keep looking back at how I was when I smoked.... and the person I am now because of it... and think... I wish I was a different person. At the same time... I'm glad I quit and look forward to more changes.

After a number of days breathing easier... I had a coughing fit this morning. I don't know why. It was very similar to the coughing fits I had each morning when I smoked. Is this part of the process? Are my lungs repairing themselves and is that causing the coughing? Are gooey things getting dislodged and am I going to eventually cough up some alien being made from the cigarette tar that's been building for the last 1/4 century?

Anyway.. still going... feeling better and worse at the same time sucks. I know it's just the emotions and they will pass eventually. But, as far as the feelings go, things suck right now.

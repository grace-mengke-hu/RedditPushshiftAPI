2nd attempt

I smoked for 10 years, then I quit for about 200 days.  About a month ago I started smoking 1-2 cigs a day again :(.  Combo of warm weather, beer, and vacation got me.  Only bought 1 pack in that time, but bumming is just too easy.  Went on a long bike ride yesterday that kicked my ass and reminded me why i quit.  Today is day 1 again, NO MORE CIGS FOR ME!!

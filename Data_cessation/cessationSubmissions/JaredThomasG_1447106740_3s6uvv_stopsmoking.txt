1 week!

And I feel so much better. I've started running again which hasn't been very easy but I count on it getting easier with persistence. I've had very strong urges to smoke throughout the week but i'm proud of myself for not giving in. Nicotine gum has helped a lot but as of today i'm moving from 4mg of nicotine per piece to 2mg. I made a whole pack of 20 pieces last an entire week! Shoot 20 cigarettes wouldn't last me a day. I really enjoy reading everyone's posts about being clean for a year or more, it's really helped me push past the struggle and motivate me to be there someday. Thank you all for the support :)

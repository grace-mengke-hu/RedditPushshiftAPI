this week is really testing me

I just started a new job, and while last week was full of meetings and get-to-know-yas and lunch and such, this week has been a bit more stressful as I settle into my role and start fighting fires (and we had a really big fire yesterday which occurred right during something I was doing to our production servers, eek!)

I've come *sorta* close. I haven't even taken the step toward getting a pack of grabbing my car keys and walking toward the car or anything, but yesterday afternoon my productivity really suffered due to major distractions due to a basically 3 hour long craving and I forced myself to distract myself by hopping on IRC and such.

This morning already I've had some serious cravings, but the day is at least less stressful so far (and hopefully will remain that way).

I dunno where I was going with this post, but I think I just needed to vent a bit and also distract myself a bit and work through this craving.

On a side note, I just had a pretty decent win during the process of writing this post (I have a long-running job running in the background and my change worked!) so that's helping the craving go away.

TL;DR: YOU CAN DO IT, NEVER GIVE UP!

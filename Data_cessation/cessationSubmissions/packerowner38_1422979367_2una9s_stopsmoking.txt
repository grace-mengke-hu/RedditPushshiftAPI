I didn't smoke after I bought a pack.

I came here a couple weeks ago to distract myself from the pack of cigarettes I bought. I'm happy to report that I still did not smoke them.

I wish I could say I don't want them, but I still do. Is anyone a long time quitter that still wants a cigarette (daily or close to)?

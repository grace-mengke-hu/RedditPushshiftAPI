So I think I've quit for good...

It's been long enough that I have lived every moment of my life without needing a cigarette. Every routine, emotion and behavior no longer requires that vice grip around my lungs. I could easily keep this up until I die or even eternity.

It's still something I will always remember. Not smoking is easy to do, so easy you get over confident and put yourself back in the hole for no reason. GL quitters, never thought I'd ever make it out.

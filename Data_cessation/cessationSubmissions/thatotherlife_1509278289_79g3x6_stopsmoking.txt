One year down !

So thrilled for this countdown , the ups and downs stopped by sixth month mark . Bars are stilll tough but I have learnt to shake it off and it goes away easier and easier, also quit drinking to get a handle on fitness so it's easier to be completely sober in a bar because smoking doesn't cross my mind if I am not inebriated.. weird shit man .. but  the freedom of not being tied to a habit is so liberating . The confidence I got from being able to quit smoking is enormous it made me feel like I could conquer many other aspects that I wanted to fix in my life but didn't think I could . I'll be running a half marathon before end of this year and I didnt do nothing until my six month mark of smoke quit . 

All the new quitters , stay at it . You can do it. It's patience and perseverance nothing beyond what you decide to to do. All the old quitters , come here and support the newbies once in a while it will show how far you have come both to yourself and others .

I've been torturing myself for last 3 months...

I've been smoke free for 10 months, till the end of April. That's when i started smoking again, with an intention of quitting again "soon".
I smoked for 3 weeks - after did quit, but only for 3 weeks. 
I have anxiety and depression issues in my life, and quitting smoking made my anxiety sky rocket with a help of anti depressants side effects. 
Then i started again, smoked for 3 weeks, and deciding to quit again now.

I really want to quit this time. But at the same time, i am afraid of my anxiety sky rocketing again, due to my body not totally being "adjusted" to anti depressant yet. 

Read Allen Carr's book. it's a great piece of advice. 
I've been smoke free for 3 hours now.

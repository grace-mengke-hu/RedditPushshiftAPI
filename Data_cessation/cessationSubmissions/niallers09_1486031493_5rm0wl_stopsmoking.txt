Hey errbody,

I'm new on here, and love to read how other people overcome the same problems I've dealt with every time I've tried to quit smoking. 
I'm smoke-free 3 weeks now and it's awesome I am slowly starting to regain my confidence again and beginning to believe I can beat this habit which has had a hold over me for a long time now. 
I am using the patches which makes it very easy as I am currently just breaking bad habits and don't have to deal with physical cravings. Breaking the task down into smaller more achievable goals. 
Has anybody else tried this method??
My only worry is that I have had a very upset stomach on 4 different occasions, at first I thought it was food poison, then mabey a bug, now I'm starting to think it is something to do with the patches. I use 4 21mg patches by day and one at night.

Accidentally on day two

So I didn't really have any intentions on quitting smoking. I just had some oral surgery two days ago and haven't been able to smoke. Quitting has always been in the back of my mind. I want to be healthier and free of all substances. I stopped drinking and doing drugs over a year ago. 

So here I am in r/stopsmoking. Hoping to get some support and advice so I can turn these two days into a year.

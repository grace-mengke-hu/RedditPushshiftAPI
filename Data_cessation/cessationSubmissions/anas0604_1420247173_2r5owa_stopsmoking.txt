46 days and completely loving being a nonsmoker

So as the title implies, I've been smoke free 46 days after 11 years of a pack a day smoking (minimum). Of course I feel wonderful! My breathing is awesome and I haven't used my inhaler in 45 days, my skin looks lifelike again, and I have more energy than I've had in a long time. This time is different. I just know it. I don't feel like smoking again. When I have a craving I think about smoking but I immediately remind myself about lung cancer, COPD, bad skin, and low energy, take a few deep breaths, and I leave the craving. This is the first time I've quit that I really have felt like I was done smoking. This is IT! I'm officially a nonsmoker!

5th time at Day 1

So I've decided to quit...again.
I've tried a few times now. I download the app, I reseat my badge, and I usually last until the weekend. Then I avoid the app and feel guilty whenever I see a post from r/stopsmoking come up.

The second I'm around alcohol I cave. I have friends that are smokers and non smokers, all would be happy to encourage me, but I don't tell them when I try and quit. It just seems easier, but I smoke so much they notice pretty quick that I'm attempting to quit. 

I'm 25, I've been smoking for 8 years and I don't want to age prematurely. I don't want to be slightly out of breath after walking up 3 flights of stairs, or too scared to go on the treadmill at the gym because I know how fast I'll run out of breath. I don't want to get cancer one day and know that I probably bought it on myself. I might have children, and I would leave them without a parent. 

I'm sick of seeing nice photo's that are ruined by cigarettes. I'm sick of needing a cigarette when I drink, and making all of my clothes smell. I always wonder, if I can smell it and I'm the smoker, how does it smell to everyone else? Winter is coming on, and I don't want to go outside into the cold for a cigarette. I don't want to get the cough I get almost every winter. The cough that I say is caused by the cold, but I know it's because I smoke.

I guess I'm making this post to reiterate this to myself. But I have never posted on here before, so maybe this anonymous encouragement can help me do this. 

I really don't know how to handle the drinking aspect of quitting, and I'm wondering if I should stop drinking for a few weeks to get over the first part. 

Anyway, thanks for reading.

The Quitting Paradox

The hardest thing about quitting: You don't smoke.

The easiest thing about quitting: You. Just. Don't. Smoke.

It doesn't always feel good or easy, but I'm starting to appreciate how simple life as a non-smoker is. When friends ask me what my plan for the future is, I say, "to not smoke, ever again."

"Quitting" used to feel so overwhelming, like something I'd never be able to manage. But "not smoking", that I now know I can do.

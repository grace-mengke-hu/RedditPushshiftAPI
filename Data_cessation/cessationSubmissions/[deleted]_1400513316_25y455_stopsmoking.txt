New Zealand here, patches don't do fuck all, been cutting down

But I love the whole ducking outside for 2min for a smoke, I am happy not smoking at home at this point, I just really do not want to give it up while working.

I am interested in the blu ecigs, has anyone had any success with them?. I really can not find anywhere that will sell them to me (we have pretty strict regulations on everything here), and the ecigs that are available I do not trust, they don't have a brand and the online stores disappear pretty quick after opening.

Would anyone send me some BLU ecigs if they have had a possessive experience with them, PM me if you want, I can paypal or whatever.

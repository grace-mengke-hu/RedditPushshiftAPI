My recipe of quitting

1) Try to quit. Try as hard as you can. For some people this will be enough. If you relapse, then proceed to the step two.

2) Determine you threshold. Is it always the 3d day that you start again? Or the fifth? For me it was the seventh day and it happened four times in a row.

3) Do everything you can to pass the threshold. Lock yourself up. Go on vacation with parents, wife or kids, i.e. with someone you cannot comfortably smoke with. For me it was a 7 day camping trip.

4) After the threshold is passed, it becomes so much easier. You really don't even think about cigarettes! If you still relapse after that, mark this as another threshold and try again. Never stop trying!

How do you know when to stop?

So, quick summation: I have to quit smoking for a surgery, I need to quit smoking for my autoimmune disease,  and I want to quit smoking for the money. 




The problem: I'm terrified that I'm going to be an asshole and I'll fail because my husband will get butthurt about me not being a barrel of laughs for several weeks. 




I bought patches.  Was going to start them today.  I chickened out.

QuitIt App Goal Ideas?

I had personally quit before for about 3 months felt great, everything was amazing and them bam! Relapsed harder then ever. I'm at it again, using the QuitIt app because it's pretty damn cool. I just can't seem to be creative enough to make up some cool goals. So I'm just wondering do you guys use the app with some custom goals? What kind of goals would you suggest?

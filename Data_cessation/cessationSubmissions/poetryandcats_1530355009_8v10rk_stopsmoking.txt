Slipped up, had a cigarette last night during a date.

Hey guys, just wanted to vent. Today would have been 7 whole days without a cigarette!... key words are “would have”. I ended up going on this really romantic date in the graveyard. The moon was out, her skin was glowing, the air was on fire. It was an amazing time. 

However, after some time, the girl lit of Camel cigarette. I have a weak spot for them, and in the moment I obliged and had one. It was stinky, made me sick to my stomach, and boy do I regret it. It seemed worth it in the moment, but it was not. I would have felt been better if I just turned it down.

So, Day 1 guys. Remember that even if it is “just one cigarette”, you’ll feel like shit once you have one. And if you don’t, you’ll probably end up buying a pack. I’m mildly hungover, and if I had less willpower I definitely would. Stay strong.

Keep trying to convince myself it doesn't matter anymore if I start again

Quit on Jan 2 of this year. I did to make myself healthier but I don't seem to care anymore. 

I've been depressed and drinking a lot more since my girlfriend broke up with me six months ago. That's another reason I wanted to quit....widen my options for ladies that's don't like smokers. However I don't think I'm going to find a woman anymore anyway.

Other factor is in going to a festival this summer and will be with smokers all weekend. The last two times I started smoking again was when I was with one of my buddies (I'm on 3rd time quitting, age 33)

I know there are lots of factors but I'm not happy and feel like something to look forward to, like smoking, will make me feel better. I know it's dumb but that's the way I am

Sorry to rant I'm having a  bad day. Thanks for reading

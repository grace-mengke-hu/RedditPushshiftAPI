Day 2 after 22 years

I hope it's ok to make a new post. [Yesterday I posted the first time!](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/4walop/day_1_after_22_years/) and I've to say: Thank you so much for your support! It really means a lot to me. 

Today is my second day as a non-smoker and unfortunately it has been a lot more harder than yesterday. I felt unwell, irritated as hell and I thought about smoking almost the whole time. I thought how stupid it was to try stop smoking in my holiday - which I couldn't enjoy now. And I thought I should have tried more things to support me, like hypnosis. And I thought - ok, Allen Carr lied. It's not easy! It's a conspiracy. Allen Carr wrote "It's easy". Everybody who tried it his way no says "It's easy" because they don't want to show weaknesses...

And then I understood. And I said: "Fuck you, brain. I'm NOT going to give you nicotine again." 

I'll go to a festival later, only for one or two hours. I didn't want to go until a few minutes ago. I wanted to go to bed very early so this day would end. But now I think: Fuck it. I stopped smoking. Nothing else. I'm not giving up anything. I won't lung at the first smoker I see, tear a cigarette out of his/her hand and start smoking again. I WANTED this. I decided it. I can do it.  

So I'm going to end my second day around people, not hidden in my bed. 

So, that's my second day.

And just so you and I and everybody knows: I'm not going to smoke again. I won't.

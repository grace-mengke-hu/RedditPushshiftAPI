Day 21. 3 weeks. Part of me can't believe it.

As some of you may know if you've seen my recent posts, Week 3 was a tough one for me. 

I don't really know how I managed to not smoke. I do know one thing for sure: posting on here, and receiving replies, REALLY helped. 

I would like to thank everyone who read/replied to my posts. The simple feeling of being heard and understood helped me more than I even realized. 

Congrats to all who are in the midst of a quit, and to all who are seriously considering it.

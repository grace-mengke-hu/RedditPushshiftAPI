I've had a helluva stressful day

I couldn't be happier with myself. I work in a restaurant and I've been trying to quit. Today proved to be a more difficult day, we had a catering to do for around 100 people but that's not too bad in comparison to other jobs we do but it was the people that we served that really made me stress out. After everything was said and done, I got back in the van after loading all the shit up and looked at my friends pack, I even went as far as looking in the pack to see how many cigs she had (to see if I could bum one) but I set 'em back down. After she got in the van she lit one up and I couldn't help but to think that It'd be okay if I just had one, but I didn't. I told myself it wasn't what I wanted, it was the stress talking so I just let her smoke.

It's the small things in life.

5 Days smoke free - what a drag

I'm feeling significantly better about myself mentally know that I'm cleansing the body from the inside.

The first 3 nights were quite rough. Had trouble sleeping, and when I did fall asleep, was ridiculously restless.


Currently trying to kick another vice of mine on-top of this. Drug abuse is not a thing to joke about.

I quit smoking due to the price of cigarette's here in Australia ($30 for a pack of 25), and got paid my monthly salary today. I am extremely tempted to splurge some money on a pack of cigarette's, so today would be the first major craving.

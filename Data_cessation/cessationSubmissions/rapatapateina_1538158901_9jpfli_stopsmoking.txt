Trying to write a essay about smoking, need help!

Hello!

I have to write an essay/lab report about something. I choose to write about smoking, the question that I came up with to do research about was  *"whats the negative effect of smoking?".* My teacher said this question is too broad and that I will not be able to write about it because there is word limit. She said I should concentrate on a special thing of smoking and try to make to question more concentrated. Then I came up with *" How does the nicotine affects the body?"* but I am not sure if this is a good thing to write about and I am wondering if someone on this reddit page can give me some other question related to smoking.

**Sorry if this is the wrong reddit page to post this considering the purpose of this place is to help quit smoking, but I thought a lot of people here have a lot of experience when it comes to smoking.**

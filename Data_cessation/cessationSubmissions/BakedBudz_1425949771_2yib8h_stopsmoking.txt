Is it normal to be dehydrated?

I stopped smoking Friday after class, and since then I have felt a constant state of dehydration. My lower lip keeps getting chapped and irritated, my throat is sore, and I'm constantly thirsty.

I've stopped smoking before and have never experienced this. Is this normal?

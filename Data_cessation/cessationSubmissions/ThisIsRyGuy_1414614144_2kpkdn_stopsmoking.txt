Started Chantix three days ago. Looking for some help and support!

I'm still currently smoking since my doctor and pharmacist said I could.  This coming Sunday is my quit date.  I've been smoking for 22 years and have previously only made it two days without falling back into the habit.  I've tried gum, patches, CT and e-cigs but none helped.  Any tips or experiences with either quitting or with Chantix?  Who do you all go to for support? Anything I should let my husband and family know before Sunday comes? Thank you all in advance. I look forward to being a quitter!

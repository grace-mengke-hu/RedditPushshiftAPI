Creating healthy alternatives to smoking

Most of us know that we need healthy alternatives to smoking.  It's not as simple as just picking a habit and running with it.  At least it wasn't for me, or most ex-smokers that I know.

I used a technique known as 6 step reframing (from hypnosis) that helped me to create alternative and healthier habits to smoking.

I whipped up a video (with a text breakdown) of how to do this technique.  I'm not quite happy with how the video turned out, so I'll probably make it more streamlined in the not to distant future.

For full disclosure - I'm creating a stop smoking program using a few different techniques.  If you find this technique helpful I'd appreciate feedback and or a testimonial :D

**note**: It's also a useful technique to deal with things such over eating after you quit smoking.  I had a HUGE problem with that.  Then I got wise and busted out this technique and nipped it in the bud.

If you have any questions let me know :D

Quit 2.0 mistakes to avoid and tools to help

I am 42 days into my second (and hopefully last ever) quit.
I have once again used the Allen Carr method (the DVD) and I have also used an app on my phone called Quitnow Pro. 
Last time I failed because of alcohol and association. This time, until I am well and truly a non smoker for life, I will be to all intents and purposes a non drinker. I am also in a new place away from many dear friends who still smoke. I am making new friends who live healthier lives and therefore don't smoke.

I am also exercising as often as I can to feel the benefits of not smoking 

I am finding the app really helps as it helps me to focus on the positive benefits of beating nicotine addiction. I can pull out my phone anywhere and remind myself that I am saving money, breathing easier, looking healthier and living longer. And all I had to do to feel all these benefits was stop doing something that I actually hated doing. 

So for me, the keys are: Stay clear of booze, hang out with non smokers, track your progress, feel the benefits

Good luck fellow quitters. I know we all have a different path but I hope some of you who are still preparing to make the leap can take something of use to you from this post.

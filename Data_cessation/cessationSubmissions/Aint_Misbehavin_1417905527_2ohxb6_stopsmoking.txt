I'm trying to stop smoking, but the fucking WALLS are closing in on me.

I found this sub about a week ago, and it.. sort of inspired me. Last night I talked about exactly how I felt about cigarettes to a really good friend of mine, and how it was the Demon in me that wont shut up.

I need a support group. I need people to look up to. I am naked without my cigarettes, and I want to stop before all of my teeth fall out and I'm reduced to nothing but a feening puddle, unfit to be called a man.

Help me, please, because I am going UP the FUCKING wall with this shit. Everything is amplified by a thousand, it feels like. I'm cleaning my teeth the best I can, and that's only a fraction of the work I have to put in here. 

23 years old, started smoking 2 packs a day when I was 18, and I NEED HELP.

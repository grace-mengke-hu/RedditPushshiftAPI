4 days in and I'm facing my greatest triggers head on

I quit 4 days ago after reading Alan Carr's book. Didn't think it would work but it really has helped me. After 10 years of smoking, I'm officially done.

Last night (and this morning) I took part in a homebrew competition where I was tasked with judging 12 beers.

It used to be that i would have a smoke after every pint but I sat there, calm and cool, for 4 hours, sampling different beers, taking in all the aroma and flavors, and didn't have a single pang.

Today I will be judging at least 15-20 beers and I have no fears.

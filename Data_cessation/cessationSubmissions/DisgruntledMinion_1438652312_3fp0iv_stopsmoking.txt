I just smoked my last cigarette!

Thanks to Allen Carr's book I just smoked the last cigarette of my life. As someone who has been smoking for 11 years and gradually worked my way up to two packs a day, I feel an incredible sense of relief. After multiple failed attempts to quit, including just about any and every NRT you can think of, and trying to quit cold turkey I couldn't figure out where I was going wrong.
I always had the desire to quit, but I also always felt like I was giving something I thought I enjoyed. Allens book brought up a bunch of good points, but the one that helped me the most is that I am not giving anything up, yet exchanging my foul habit for all good outcomes. Another great point that he made which resonated with me is that I don't enjoy them at all like I thought, like his book said to do, I went out and had my last cigarette inhaling deep into my lungs while searching for a reason as to why I enjoyed it. I came up with nothing. 
It relieves no stress, aids in no way of concentration, and does absolutely nothing positive for me. I came on to /r/stopsmoking today about 3 hours ago and scrolled through a few threads when I stumbled upon his book and then read it from beginning to end.

Thank you /r/stopsmoking for helping. I will be periodically checking back in to update my progress, but I am more motivated and excited to quit than I ever have been before. I WILL successfully continue to be a non-smoker from this point forward, and I will have you guys to thank.

So thank you, I will be joining your ranks.

Here's the link to the book that I used.

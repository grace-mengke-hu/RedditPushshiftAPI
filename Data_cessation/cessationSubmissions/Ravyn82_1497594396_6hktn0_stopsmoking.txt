5 years: My story

Hello everybody!

I am 23 hours away from 5 years as a non-smoker. I want to share a bit about that, if I can make even one person see that it'll be okay and it doesn't matter how long you've smoked before you quit then I'll be happy

**Where it started**:

I started smoking somewhere around 1995 or 1996; I was 13 or 14 years old.

All of the parental influences in my life smoked, my dad, step-dad and mom all smoked at least a pack a day, most of my friends smoked too.

At first I would take a single cigarette and there from open packs that a parent left lying around. Never to many to quickly, as we all know a single cigarette once or twice a week won't be noticed.     
Eventually I started taking full packs when I was around 15 from the cartons my father bought or I'd find some generous older person to buy them for me.     
By age 16 or 17 I had been found out by my parents and in order to not be hypocritical they allowed my smoking, even at times buying them for me rather than have me take the risk of trying to buy them myself.

**Fast forward to 2012**:

I don't mind being a smoker. It wasn't anything I felt I needed to change in my life. My wife didn't smoke and she had said she would love me to quit but she knew it wasn't something that can be forced so she didn't push. I didn't smoke around the kids and that was enough for her.     
What changed me from a smoker to a non-smoker was a tragic event:

My step-father had been in my life since the day I was born. He and I had a great relationship. He wasn't my dad and he never tried to be, he just knew he had to be a positive role model.     
He had also smoked since around the age of 14 despite having serious problems with asthma and sinus trouble...spring was the worst time for him with all the pollen.

He had decided in 2012 to quit smoking himself, He knew it was affecting him and he was tired of coughing all the time so around the beginning of the year he started cutting back and by February he had quit completely.

**Easter Weekend 2012**:

My kids were staying over Friday to Saturday...that was the original plan but we had work things come up so we called and asked if they could stay one more night     
"Of course, we love having the kids over, we will put together Easter baskets for them and have a great time"     

**2:00 am Easter morning**:     
the phone rings...It was my mother, "[step-father] is gone, oh my god he's gone, you need to be here now" So we jumped into the car and made a 45 minute drive in 30 minutes...

When she got home from work he handed her some cash and said "kids are staying one more night, the bunny needs to come tonight..." and so she went shopping for candy and baskets.

Once the kids were tucked away in bed they started assembling; halfway through he started waving his hands and grabbing his throat...     
massive asthma attack which in turn led to an embolism. He hit the floor hard enough to break the wooden coffee table.     
They told us that it was so quick that there was nothing that could have been done...it was so powerful that they said if he'd been lying in a hospital bed he still wouldn't have made it.

I realized over the course of the next couple of weeks that the best thing I could do to honor his life and memory was to quit. It had been to late for him but it wouldn't be to late for me.

I picked my date about two months out from his death and that was my quit date.

A lot of people say, don't tell people you're quitting, it adds undue pressure. Just quit and tell them once you've done it, but I told everybody.     
I told them I was quitting and I told them that when I came and asked them for a cigarette that they had better not give me one. 

**The night leading up to my quit day**:      
around 5 p.m. I went onto the porch with a few packs. I sat there and chain smoked, getting in that last bit before it was done...that was very helpful in that by the time midnight hit I had smoked about 4 packs and I didn't even want to *look* at a cigarette let alone smoke one.     
Just one after another until the clock struck 12; I had two cigarettes left, I took them out of the pack, broke them in half, threw them away and went to bed.

**The aftermath**     
Was it easy to quit?     
Of course not! I was a grouch and irritable, I felt like something was missing...I had been smoking for 17 years, at that point I had smoked longer than I hadn't smoked.

I chewed a lot of gum and ate a lot of carrots.     
I carried cut drinking straws (cigarette length) so I had something to do with my hands.     
I used the patch for about a week until I decided it was just one more crutch keeping me on nicotine.

It wasn't easy, but it was worth it. The way food and drink tasted changed dramatically, I smelled better....     
the first time I saw my mom after I quit the smell of smoke was overpowering, I looked at my wife after she left and asked if that was how I had smelled for our whole relationship, when she said yes I apologized because it was so overpowering!

I had to take it an hour at a time, and then a day at a time, and then a month at a time...

It's been a long journey, there were times in that first year when it felt like it was to much.     
That same year I lost my grandmother who helped raise me when it was just me and my dad. The fact that my first thought wasn't "Man I need a smoke" really showed me that I was getting past it.

This story is so hard to tell, 5 years later and I am sitting here with a lump in my throat and tears in my eyes. I don't tell this story so I can tell people how long it has been since i quit, I tell this story when I get the chance because he helped me so much during my life and I need people to know that he helped me one final time in death.

Thank you all for listening to me ramble.

Stay strong and remember that you can quit, you can make it through this.     
You can fix the damage before it is to late.

Day 25, temptation strikes, looking for opinions

I am looking for opinions/examples of what you do in difficult situations where you either smell cigarette smoke or hang out at an old spot or see an old friends that brings back smoking memories. Although I have not had any slips since I quit 3 1/2 weeks ago, the devil on my shoulder gives me the fleeting temptation to indulge a little. 

Any advice is good advice thanks in advance.

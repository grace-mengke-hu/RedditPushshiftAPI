I need help in being more supportive to my SO who is now trying to quit..

The title says it all basically. Back when him and I first met, he was smoking about two packs a day. Two years later, he's down to about one pack a day. I know I should be thanking my stars that he's cut down that much, and I do! I just wish I knew how to describe it. I used to be a smoker in my late teens, and I smoked for a little over a year. I had no issue quitting what so ever just out of the blue one day after about a pack every two day habit. Having been able to do that 'cold turkey', I just can't fathom how people can't stop like I could and I'm well aware that's not how I should think. I hate thinking like that, trust me. My SO and I get into fights over this and I want to find a way to be more supportive. What are some things I could possibly do, or not do (besides nit pick, etc) that could possibly help him along? I've been praising him for cutting back little by little lately, but I feel as if I should be helping or doing more. Anyone have any suggestions?

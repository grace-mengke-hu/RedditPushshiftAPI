60 days smoke free!

Thanks for everyone writing comments and posts on this site. You have given me a lot of encouragement directly and by proxy, without this sub I don't think I would have made it.

I try to keep posting along the way and check in once in a while. I owe you that much. 60 days is better than 7 days, but I'm not completely out of the woods. 

I have used my brother's ecig a few times, but other than that I quit cold turkey. 

Keep going! If I could do it so can you!

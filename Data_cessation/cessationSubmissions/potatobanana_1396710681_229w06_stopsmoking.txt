Day 1

Consider this as day 1. I've been smoking since I age 18 (26 now) and I've been trying to quit for a while now. Now it really needs to be done, partly for medical reason but mostly because I just got baptised 2 weeks ago (yes I know, for some its not really reason enough) and it was one of my promises.

So here I am. I need help, the mental battles in the next couple of days is gonna be a b*itch and the way my tongue would crave is going to be a pain.

edit: Any tips anyone?

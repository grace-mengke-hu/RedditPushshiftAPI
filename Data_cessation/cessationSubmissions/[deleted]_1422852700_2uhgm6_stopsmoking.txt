I stopped smoking a month ago and think I figured out why.

About a month ago I tripped on lsd and had a fucking crazy trip. Mostly 100% greatness, but super heavy. I can't explain it, but afterwards I had no desire for cigs. In fact, they became super gross (like when I was a kid).



I just realized that I watched the first DVD from a 3 DVD set that's supposed to hypnotize you into a non-smoker. The last 15 minutes are hypnosis. 



The lsd trip must have triggered something I experienced in the DVD.

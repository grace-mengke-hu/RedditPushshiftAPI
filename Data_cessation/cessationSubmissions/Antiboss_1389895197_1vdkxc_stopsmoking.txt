Close to Week One

In about 4 hours i am hitting the first 7 days without a Cigarette and just wanted to share my story

I was a smoker for almost 10 years and did a cold turkey don't know why exactly but i did. First days weren't that hard tbh, was just tired as shit and slept most of the time since it was a long Weekend for me. Last few days especially at work it was so hard to see all coworkers smoke and enjoy it. its fucking hard to resist and don't know if i can do it any longer...

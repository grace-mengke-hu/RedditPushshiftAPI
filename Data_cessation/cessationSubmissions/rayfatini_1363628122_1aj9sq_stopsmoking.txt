Today is the day!

Ive been lurking around this sub for some time now, and after seeing so many people able to stop i feel that now is my time. After seeing a post yeaterday of a picture from fight club, before i went to sleep, the line " its your life, and its ending one minute at a time"  haunted me throughout the night, in my dreams. Upon waking up, i knew that after all the mental preperation, i was ready. So here i go.... No more cancer sticks... EVER AGAIN.

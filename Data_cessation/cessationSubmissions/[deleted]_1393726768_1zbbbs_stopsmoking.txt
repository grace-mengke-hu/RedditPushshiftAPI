Day 11 without smoking!

Hey all! Im nineteen and have been smoking daily for about two and a half years. I hid it from everyone, lied about it, made positive I didnt smell. The thought of someone considering me "a smoker" was so embarrassing to me. I guess I honestly thought it cured boredom and made me cool and whatnot. But, im focusing on my heth and its time i stop being a dumb teenager. So im on day 11 and its going perfect! Just wanted to spread some encouragment, it IS possible!

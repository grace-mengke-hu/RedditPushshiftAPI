Difficult times

I quit smoking Dec 13 2012.  Been doing great.  Wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.  However my life plans have recently changed due to my husbands work.   So we all of a sudden need a brand new plan likely in a new city.  Where I will have to find a new job.   I love my current job btw.  Find a new school for my son.   And I had to put my dog of 11 years to sleep last week.  
It's so much at once I'm having a very hard time dealing and it's making cravings strong.  Would love some words of encouragement.

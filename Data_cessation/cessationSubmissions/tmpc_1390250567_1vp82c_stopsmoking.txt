Quitting Today

I've been smoking for about 13 years and this is my second attempt to quit. The first was about 8 years ago and lasted for 2 months. During those months I felt great  (confident, healthy, I could keep up with non-smoking friends playing sports) but the internal fight never stopped and I ended up relapsing. I'm hoping the fact that I'm older now will make it easier this time around. Wish me luck!

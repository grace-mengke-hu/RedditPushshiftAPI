Using patches, but it's still tough. Here's how I've been dealing

I smoked my last cigarette Sunday evening, 11:23 p.m. I've been using the patch to quell most of the issues, but I'm still dealing with quitter's flu  -aches and pains, lots of phlegm - and I still have moderate cravings. 

Three things I am doing to make this time my last time quitting:

1. Drink water. So much water. I have to use the bathroom all the time, but I swear I can feel the angry crackling in the back of my head dull when I drink it.

2. I don't tell myself I *can't* smoke, I tell myself I *don't* smoke. Want a cigarette? Nah. I'm not denying myself, really. It's just not something I do anymore. It's part of who I am now. I don't smoke. Not a smoker. Nope.

3. Every time the craving kicks in particularly hard, I tell myself I am feeling this because smoking made me so sick. I'm not feeling this because I'm quitting, I'm feeling this because I smoked. I'm just now realizing how sick smoking made me, and now is my chance to make myself well again.

I use these primarily, but I also have a list of the reasons I want to quit in my wallet and a pack of nicotine gum to use in concert with the patch if I ever get to that point. It's still unopened, though. I hope these tips help you guys, and hope that they keep working for me.

Stay strong!

I was doing so well, but this is hard

I was doing so well. The cravings were gone. I was feeling better. Cigarette smoke smelled terrible, I was completely resolved and confident.


Just had a bad fight with my SO. A lot of screaming and crying. Now I’m sitting here, drinking rum from my coffee cup, it’s 3 in the afternoon, and I haven’t touched hard liquor in ages, bowl after bowl of weed, trying to breathe, trying to calm down and all I can think of is SMOKE. smokesmokesmokesmokesmoke I can almost feel the taste of tobacco in my mouth. SO has a few cigarettes in his pack. I’m stroking the cat and trying not to think about it, staring at my 45 day badge. Tell me it won’t be worth it.


Edit: It passed. I didn’t smoke, but I was close. It wouldn’t have been worth it. Weed helped a lot. Cats are awesome.

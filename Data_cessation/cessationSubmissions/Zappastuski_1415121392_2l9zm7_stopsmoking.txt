Quit by accident yesterday, not optimistic but gonna try to roll with it.

I've quit before.  Made it 8 months and 6 months on different occasions, but it's been 2 years since I've really tried.  Yesterday I just didn't have a pack and was too busy to get one, so I'm gonna roll with it and see how far I can get.

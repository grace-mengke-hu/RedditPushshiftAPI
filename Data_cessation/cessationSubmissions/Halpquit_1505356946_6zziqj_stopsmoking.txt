Advice or tips?

So my girlfriend is trying to quit smoking. But she says she'll get heart burn and the only thing to make the heart burn go away is to smoke a cigarette. I don't under stand it. Has any body else experienced that? I googled it and the only thing I found was smoking causes heart burn.

One month since I thought I was going to die.

Well, a month and a day to be exact.

Christmas morning I woke up at 4 a.m. having an asthma attack and thought I was going to wind up in the E.R. I put down my cigarettes and never looked back. Thank you all, and I know you guys can make it.

I'm proud of myself, and I'm proud of all my bros out there that are kicking this awful habit.

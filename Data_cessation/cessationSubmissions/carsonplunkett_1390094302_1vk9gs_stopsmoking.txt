Four days down...

As of 11 PM CST tonight I will be four days clean. Took the cold turkey route and haven't used a patch, gum, vape, etc. It was tough, but not nearly as bad as I expected. I feel so much better. 

There's one thing that I'm having trouble with. I really miss the act of smoking itself. I miss being able to light a cigarette and simply enjoy smoking it. I've thought about purchasing an e-cigarette with no nicotine in it. Would this be detrimental to the progress I've already made? Should I just tough this out and move on? 

this sounds stupid after typing it out. This is just a huge change for me. Any advice would be appreciated.

No idea what to do?

This is my 8th day smoke free. 

I’m a horrible person now I’ve quit. I’m so miserable and irritable I literally hate who I am like this. I keep lashing out at my fiancé, who commented it surprises him when I’m nice now, and he doesn’t want to tell me to stop being irritable in case I hit him. 

This has really upset me. I’d never ever hurt him- he is my life and best friend. I feel heartbroken he feels that way about me. I used to be nice why aren’t I anymore? 

Now I’m just sat here crying with a packet of cigs in front of me (they’re his) and I have no idea how to cope with feeling this way without a cig. 

My anxiety seems to have disappeared but has been replaced by the depression I thought I’d escaped years ago. Every other thread on here I read was “smoking causes my depression” but not for me- I loved it, and it kept me sane. Now I’m just so miserable and the person I hold dearest to me thinks so low of me... I just don’t know what to do. 

I’m also so scared about putting on weight in my quit I don’t really want to eat... I improved my diet and cut out alcohol s couple of years ago cuz I was so fat, and now I have to give up the “naughtiest” thing about me. Everything feels so boring now. I don’t want to reward myself with sweets. Everyone’s all “putting on a few pounds (11lbs on average which is quite a lot imo) is better than smoking” but to me it really isn’t, not after everyone made such a huge fuss over how big I was.

I’m really really struggling and I have nobody to talk to. I asked my therapist last week about quitting smoking and she said it was the best thing I could’ve done, but it doesn’t feel like it ever will be. 

I feel like a much shittier person now. Not even the person I love most wants to be around me... I’m so alone in this quit. My family have all quit in the past but with everything they just say it’ll be fine, that I’ll get over it.

Questioning the addictiveness of cigarettes

I used to smoke, quit pretty easily really as I never found it addictive, I found swimming and cycling helped as both were enjoyable and if I smoked between doing either it meant my lungs hurt but would make myself do it anyway, eventually stopped smoking as I found cycling more rewarding than burnt leaves, found smoking more of just a lifestyle habit really, and im very glad not to worry about at all anymore. However I have always questioned how quit smoking initiatives etc go about helping people quit. Each one of these initiative or nicotine substitute companies directly and bluntly reiterates how addictive cigarettes are, keep reminding you and telling you how hard quitting is. I wonder if this constant talk of addictiveness compounds how difficult quitting is for some people. Almost as if it conditions smokers to believe what they are up against is somehow bigger and harder than it really is.  it gives the smoker an excuse to quit quitting also. ‘I tried to quit but I was just craving a cigarette. They are so addictive’. And then they proceed to point you to nicotine patches or gum or something. Perhaps I was lucky, I don’t know I’m a sample size of one, so what I’m suggestion isn’t much but if you are planning on quitting smoking, firstly it is way better not being a smoker I guarantee it, secondly are you actually physically addicted to smoking or is it just lifestyle. My bet it’s just lifestyle, I don’t believe they are actually as chemically addictive as they claim. Take up and aerobic sport, push yourself with it, enjoy it and each time your lungs burn like hell remember that that’s because of smoking. 

Just some thoughts, hope it helps someone.

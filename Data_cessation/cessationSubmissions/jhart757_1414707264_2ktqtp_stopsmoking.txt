Just about to hit 24 hours without a cigarette...

And i feel great. When i woke up this morning, my throat didn't burn like it usually did. Other than that, i haven't noticed any more physical effects, but watching the timer from the last cigarette I smoked get larger and larger makes me feel great. Will report in again when i hit 7 days! 

Couldn't have done it without hours of lurking this subreddit!

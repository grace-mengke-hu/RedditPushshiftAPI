How do you guys/gals overcome the little mental battles you have with yourself?

I feel really lucky to feel the way I do right now, my physical withdrawal is very very mild so it doesn't bother me so much. However, I keep having these moments of mental weakness where I try and convince myself that I need to smoke/it's not that bad. I usually end up caving and smoke one, I'm 4 days into trying to quit and I've only had 4 cigs, which I would say is a big accomplishment for me. But the internal dialogue is so difficult to overcome and I don't know how to move past it. Anyone else have a similar experience and have any pointers?

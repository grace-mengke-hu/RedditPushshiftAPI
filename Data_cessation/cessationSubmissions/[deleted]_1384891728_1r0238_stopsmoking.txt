In 2 days I'll be 3 years smoke-free. I still have my Alan Carr audiobook CDs. If you're serious and ready to quit, first to PM from US me gets them free.

Include your address.  I'll even pay shipping.  It's my way of paying back the people who guided me on my successful journey.

Good luck quitters!

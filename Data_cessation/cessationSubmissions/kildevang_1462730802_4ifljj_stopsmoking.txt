Day 1. Quitting while i can

For about 3-4 months i have been smoking at parties and "special occasions". Yesterday (at a party) i lost half a pack of cigarettes and i don't remember how. 

Today, with mild hangover I found my lighter in my pocket and said to myself "screw it. No more". My lighter is in the trashcan now, and I won't smoke again!

Usually i've been smoking 1 or 2 cigarettes every other week, so I feel like i can do this.

Thank you drunk me :)

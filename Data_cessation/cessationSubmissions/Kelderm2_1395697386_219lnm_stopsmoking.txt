202 days!

I just thought I'd stop by here after a long period away and realized how long I have gone without smoking.  Just wanted to say that I'm proud of myself and that it gets way easier for all the people trying to quit!  I rarely even think about smoking anymore.  Also, I've run 3 5ks in the past week, damn lung capacity gets better after quitting.

Advice on quitting needed with exams coming up.

I have exams coming up in 2 weeks time and I really want to quit smoking. I’m just worried that if I quit now I’ll be depressed and will lose focus and won’t be able to revise for these exams. I feel like this is a shitty excuse but I want to know your thoughts, will quitting impact my ability to work effectively?

Quitting & Camping. Any Protips?

I've hit my 2 week mark smoke and nicotine free. Thats about 200 cigarettes I haven't smoked and $70 bucks saved. I'm freakin' ecstatic about that!!!

However, I'm going camping this weekend with about 15 people that all smoke, its going to be tough to not give in to temptation. especially since a few are pretty big enablers. 

Do any of you have any helpful advice/sugggestions to help me make it through this temptation ridden weekend smoke and nicotine free???

**EDIT:**Well, I made it! It wasn't half as hard as I imagined it was going to be. Thanks for all the tips! Part of the reason I didn't give in was because of this sub reddit, so I appreciate everyone's help!

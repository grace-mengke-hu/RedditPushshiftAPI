Day 13... Exam worries

Hi guys

After 13 days of not smoking, I have never felt better. One problem im facing now is an exam on Tuesday. This will be the first time since high school i've not smoked with exams coming up. I don't feel like a need a ciggarette but i'm just a little worried. These pre exam worries are making the cravings much stronger.

I just really needed to get how i am feeling out.

Thanks for reading!

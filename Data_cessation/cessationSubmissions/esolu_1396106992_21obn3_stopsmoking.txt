So how many relapses this weekend?

Sundays and Mondays can be so depressing around here.  I hate all of the relapse posts.  Think about it going in guys, plan on making it through.  Go in mindful and plan on using the opportunity to beat another trigger.

It's too late after you relapse, seek help before you put the cancer stick to your lips and suck.

I'll keep an eye on this thread, so post here if you are concerned that your general post may go unanswered in time.  Or do both for that matter.  By the time you are done posting both your craving will be gone.

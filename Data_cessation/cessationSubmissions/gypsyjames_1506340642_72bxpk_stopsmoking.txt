Day 1

Disclaimer: I did see a post where someone else quit today but I don't want to try to steal their thunder. 

I am going into the military in April and want to deal with the stress of withdrawal now as smoking isn't allowed in basic training. This particular day is ideal because three months smoke free is the only Christmas present I can afford myself. On second thought with the money I save I can treat myself to a damn fine gift. Like many others I am making it public so I feel more accountable.

And so it begins...I will update this post as I see fit.

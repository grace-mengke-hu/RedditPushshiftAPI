I'm on day 4 and I just want to say I feel good.

I'm not letting my guard down, I am committed this time. I've been very occasionally chewing cloves to help with really bad cravings - it seems to work for me - but I'm watching I don't use it too much. My energy levels have gone up, my breathing is already noticable easier, and seeing my lungs trying to clear itself of gunk feels really great (as gross as it is to see black specks in my phlegm). My mood has been all over the place and I've definitely hurt people with my irritability (which I'm not happy about but apologized for). I'm trying to keep myself in check and hopefully things will level out very soon.

I know the worst is still not over and I'm watching for triggers. Guard up.

My biggest challenge will be when I hangout with my best friend who is also a smoker. He is very supportive and also wants to quit but haven't taken the plunge yet.

I just want to say that it's day 4 and I already feel better than I have since I started smoking 4 years ago. Cigarettes have been bringing me down and it will no longer.

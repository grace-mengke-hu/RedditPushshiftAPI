10 days smoke free! Can't believe it

Hi everyone, firstly this website is brilliant for me, seeing that there is so many others suffering but staying strong gives me real strength. I have been off cigarettes for ten days, am 25 and smoked 10-15 a day and then the weekends out drinking around a million then!ha for ten years. I have been using the patches and gum but have definitely found things tough from anxiety about things in my life (that I always dealt with easily before) fear of things happening to me, depression, dreams of smoking then nightmares and waking up sweating!ha saying that the times I don't have urges I just feel great and as each day passes am getting stronger and more determined to make this one fight I don't lose! I went out for a few beers other day and I didn't touch one because am not going through this hell to slip and I felt so so proud of myself! My taste and smell, I look much fresher, my teeth are getting whiter and I exercised the other day and felt I had so much energy! Brilliant. Here's to another day, week then month then year, then decade!! :)

I dreamed a dream...

...last night that I "accidentally" bought a pack of cigarettes at my local convenience store. In the dream, once I got home I realized that I didn't smoke anymore. But, I figured, I'd paid the $7.25 for the pack, right? Might as well have one. Just one!

Thing is, even in my dream I knew that would be stupid. One cigarette? Ha! I'd end up smoking the entire pack. So I made myself a deal: I'd take three of the cigarettes out and destroy the rest. Then, and only then, would I enjoy the three cigarettes I'd "accidentally" bought over the course of the next week. What would be the harm?! It's not like I'd be able to smoke an entire pack!

Of course, this being a dream and all, something went wrong. When I was trying to take out the three cigarettes from the pack I messed up somehow and ended up destroying all twenty of them. 

My dream ended with me trying to rationalize the fact that I now *deserved* to go back to the store and buy another pack. You know, just to get those three cigarettes.

Thankfully it was just a dream. I'm still smoke free although I am still using 2mg gum (two pieces day down from a high of ten) and the occasional puff of my e-cig.

Day 13 and I have some questions

Hi guys,

I read Alan Carr's book and have been glued to this subreddit for 2 weeks and so far so good! I have some questions though - In Alan's book, he talks about how cigarette's don't add anything to your life, they simply get rid of the cravings but ever since quitting I've been confused, forgetful, impulsive, hyperactive and i have trouble collecting my thoughts. When i was a kid, i was diagnosed with ADHD and these feelings are remeniscant of that. In fact, the more I think about it most of my achievements have happened after beginning to smoke. I even dropped out of college as a non-smoker and went back as a smoker to graduate with mostly high distinctions. 

I've been reading up on it and there's quite a lot of evidence that points to cigarettes helping treat ADHD symptoms. It's also easier to start and the withdrawal symptoms are stronger. I want to believe what Alan Carr says and that it's all in my head, but the brain fog is pretty hard to ignore at this point.

Did any of you experience this? Were my cigarettes medicating my ADHD condition or are these simply temporary withdrawals? I'm not tempted to smoke because physically, i feel so much better but I'd really hate to replace them with adderall or something similar.

Thanks so much for your help guys.

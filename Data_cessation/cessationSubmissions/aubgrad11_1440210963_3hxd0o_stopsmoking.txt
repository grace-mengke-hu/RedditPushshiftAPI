Reading Allen Carr after switching to vaping

Has anyone done it? How did it affect you? I am currently at 29 days of vaping since my last cigarette. About 1/4 of the way through Carr's book that I started last night. Has anyone quit vaping after reading it? If not, how did reading Carr after vaping for a while affect you?

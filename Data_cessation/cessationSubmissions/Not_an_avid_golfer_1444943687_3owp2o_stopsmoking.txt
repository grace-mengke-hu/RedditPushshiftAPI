Nine days. Coffee, cigarettes and action addiction

I don't miss the smell. I only slightly miss the taste. I definitely don't miss the taste it leaves in my mouth. I *thoroughly* miss a coffee and a cig in the morning. I don't even particularly like coffee, and I didn't smoke my first cigarette until about a month after my 18th birthday in September last year. There's just something beautiful about sitting on my porch on a summer's morning, listening to the sounds of the forest, drinking a robust cup of black coffee and enjoying a Lucky Strike. There's nothing I miss more about smoking than that. 

I'm not even sure if there's such a thing as action addiction, but it's what I would describe my addiction as. I quit smoking about two months ago because I felt a nicotine addiction coming. I caved in after two weeks but I decided to tone it down. After that I haven't felt a nicotine addiction, but an action addiction. I can go as long as I want to without a cigarette as long as I'm busy. I'd smoke when I was bored. I'd smoke when I needed a break and not because I needed a cigarette but because I needed to do something else. It became something I did just to have something to do. During the past week I've been sitting with my pencil between my index and middle finger through hours of lectures, without feeling the need to actually smoke. 

I'm nine days in, and I'm starting to feel like I don't need any of it any more ^^except ^^a ^^coffee ^^and ^^a ^^cig ^^^holy ^^^fuck

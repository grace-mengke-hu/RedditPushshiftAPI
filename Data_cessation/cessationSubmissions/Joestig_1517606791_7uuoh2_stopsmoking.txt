After 60 days of not smoking, I had a relapse. Took me a week to get up again. This is what I learned...

**The good**: it is possible to recover quickly. I smoked less than two packages.

**The bad**: Even though I did not smoke much, I notice that my lungs have to recover, I can cycle and run much less fast than I used to (the good is that I can expect a lot of recovery in the last months, as I witnessed during my last attempt). A lot of mucus is coming out of my lungs and throat, which is a sign that recovery is happening (and has to happen). I do think that the 2 packages didn't do enough damage to make the 60 days worthless, but it's bad. I learned that I should continue to aim to not smoke *at all*. One cigarette was enough to trigger this addiction, and one is enough to give me the symptoms of a cold. I also have to recover from my addition, as I notice that I do have cravings now. It's much less than 9 days ago, but I do have 1-3 cravings on average per day. In the second month of the 60 days I had 1-3 cravings in total. I guess that teaches me that this more difficult phase is temporary.

**The ugly**: I thought I had no desire to smoke left. I thought I had beaten it for good. Apparently I hadn't (I learn that I will need to stay vigilant, even after not having cravings for a long time).

**TL;DR**: I'd like to share some lessons that I learned: the good is that you can recover quickly from relapses, the bad is that even after a brief relapse your lungs have to recover and your addiction can come back pretty powerfully, and the ugly is that even after quitting for a long time you're not invincible, your cravings may stay dormant for a long time but they can grab you in a weak moment if you're not careful (but I do believe that you can resist if you stay vigilant).

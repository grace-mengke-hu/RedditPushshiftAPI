Need advice about quitting

I had my last cigarette last night and bought the patch today, which I am currently wearing. I've tried to quit so many times before but I always go back if I'm stressed or drinking. 
Have you come up with any alternatives that really work for you? I would love to hear about them and try them out! Thanks for your help :)

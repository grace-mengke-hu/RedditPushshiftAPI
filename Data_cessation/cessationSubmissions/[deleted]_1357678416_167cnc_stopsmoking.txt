Twenty Days, feeling great!

Twenty days clean since my last smoke. I had about fifty before that, but I got way too drunk and ended up smoking two cigarettes. Just two. UGH! I COULD HAVE SEVENTY DAYS RIGHT NOW! :(

But I feel better being honest about my clean date, even if it's just two squares, than I would not being completely honest. Here's to twenty days, woot!

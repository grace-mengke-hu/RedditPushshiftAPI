Can it really be as simple as getting lunch?

My title is odd I know and I was going to wait until I reached the two week mark to post again BUT BUT BUT I think I may have had my "revelation" or moment or whatever.

Day 11 I had a weak moment and took a few drags of a cigarette and it made me super sick.

Day 12 I was in withdrawals pretty badly but it only lasted the day

today I feel amazing and I went to lunch and it hit me that I could just GO TO LUNCH, without having to map out my smoke breaks ..am I too hungry to have one before? Should I wait till after I eat and have 2 instead? 

Then I just wandered around, did some shopping, enjoyed the fresh air before coming back to the office to eat.

When I got back two smokers were outside the building and the girl smoker was just hacking and sucking on her cigarette and it was THE FIRST TIME I didn't feel a pang of jealousy.

I actually just smiled and took my food in and sat down and it was the best feeling!

I know the bad days probably aren't over yet BUT I got a taste of what it feels like to be a non-smoker and had to share in case anyone is struggling or needs some kinda bright spot. I feel amazing today!

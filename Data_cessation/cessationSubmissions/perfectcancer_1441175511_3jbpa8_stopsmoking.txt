Started again

After almost a year (my badge is a lie) I went out one night, just like many others, I stupidly accepted a cigarette from somebody thinking it could be a one time thing. Now I've been smoking for about two months again. I'm waiting to be picked up for work at the moment with that all too familiar weak and tight chest. Let this be a reminder to anybody thinking it can be a singular event. I was over 10 months in and now I'm back to where I started. I will be resetting my badge again soon which is devastating when the number is that big, and for anybody that gets this reference, fuck the zero. 
Good luck everyone

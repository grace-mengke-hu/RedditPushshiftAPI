2 weeks in!

Hey guys! Been 2 weeks now and I haven't had too many cravings ... until yesterday. I have had insane cravings the past two days and I've been going slightly mad with it.

I've avoided a friend I generally meet when I'm in town because he's a trigger. I've avoided going out of the house on the weekend because that's the motherlode of triggers. Basically, I've done a lot to keep myself distracted but never near triggers. I've studied (for an exam coming up) like mad, I've written code, written stuff in my journal ... but the fucking thing just doesn't go.

Honestly, I thought I wouldn't get any cravings this far into my quit but this is worse than the first few days when all I had were simple 2 minute cravings that I needed to ignore long enough. Now, there is a persistence. I feel the need to get down tomorrow on the way to somewhere and have a smoke but there is another part of me literally shouting "AND THAT WOULD BE THE END OF THAT, IS IT?!"

I just read a post here that gave me a good boost (always find something good on this sub) but I'm not a 100% sure it'll last till tomorrow morning. I'm saving up all the comments and videos I see here on my phone to make sure that I do not fucking cave. But advice is always good. Thanks guys! Let's hope we don't smoke tomorrow.

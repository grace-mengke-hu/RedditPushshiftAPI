5 months today and going to a job interview smelling goooood

Quit on the 29th of february! Still get the odd craving but keep repeating to myself how crazy it would be to put all that hard work to waste now. 
Looking forward to getting to 6 months and then a year!
I used to light up straight after waking up, if I can quit you can too!! 


Job interview in 2 hours! Wish me luck :)

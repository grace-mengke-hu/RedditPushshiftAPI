I caved.

A little over 2 months ago I quit cold turkey, I used maybe 6 pieces of nicorette gum, but thats it.

I quit mostly because of money. I work at a small grocery store and for the last week or so ive been staring at these big bags of tobacco we sell and thinking to myself "well if I rolled my own it would be way cheaper than buying $7 packs of marlboros once a day, or the cheap $5 pack of montclairs." Everyday I would look at those bags.

Well today after work I caved and bought a pack of marlboros. "Just to see if i really wanted to smoke again". And I smoked one just now. It didn't taste as good as i remembered, and I'm kind of ashamed, but still not sure if i want to keep smoking.

I'm kind of just venting, I guess..

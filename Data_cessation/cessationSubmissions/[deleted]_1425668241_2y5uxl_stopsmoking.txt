Woke up craving a smoke

I am 3 days in and when I woke up today, all that was on my mind was where could I get a cigarette.  I refused to get out of bed as I was afraid that I would make a bad decision such as go to the store and buy a pack.  I then grabbed my phone and checked emails and facebook notifications and the next thing I knew I was not craving any more and I was able to get out of bed without worrying. :)

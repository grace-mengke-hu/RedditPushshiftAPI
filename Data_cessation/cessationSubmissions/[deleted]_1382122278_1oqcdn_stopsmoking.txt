18 Days. No longer feel like my insides are on fire.

The strangest part of this whole experience is how closely smoking cigarettes are linked to the passage of time. (At least for me). The first few days moved at a glacial pace, especially in the hour or so directly after a meal, but now time seems to be moving normally again.
And also the edgy/burning feeling seems to be subsiding.

Anyone else notice this? (Also this is my first ever post on Reddit after a year of using the site).

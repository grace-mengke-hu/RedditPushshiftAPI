At least one person noticed.

Last weekend I was watching UFC fights at a sports bar with my girlfriend and a friend of ours. As he went to the restroom after smoking she commented about how glad she is that I don't smoke anymore and how she doesn't miss the stank of stale cigarettes. 

It made me happy to receive her encouragement, even though I have completely resolved to never smoke again. Today marks two months. Here's to many more.

If you're thinking about quitting, or in the beginning stages of your journey...

You CAN do it! This subreddit, along with Google Images: 'Anti-Smoking', helped me tremendously!

In mid-July of 2012, I quit cold turkey. All I did for preparation was stop smoking in my car for a week or two prior, as that was the hardest part for me. (For the record, I quit smoking MaryJane on Thanksgiving 2011 - so cigarette use skyrocketed.)

To this day, I'm still smoke-free! This winter was the first in a long time without the dreadful smoker's cough. You will feel absolutely FANTASTIC once you get over the hump. I can sprint without being out of breath! I can go places without reaking of cigarette smoke! I have more cash to do what I want with!

The point to this post is this... Don't let the temptations win. Mind before matter wins this game. You CAN do it. 

Hasta la vista /r/stopsmoking. Keep it up!

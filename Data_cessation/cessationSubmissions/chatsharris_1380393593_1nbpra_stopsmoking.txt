Day from hell... reset badge?

What started as a simple painting job on my spare room has wound with the entire wall of paint coming off like soft butter. A pretty stressful time with my rental inspection coming up in a couple of days. I asked my partner to roll me a smoke, and I smoked it. Didn't enjoy it in the slightest. Won't be smoking again in a hurry!

Should I reset my badge, or see if lightning strikes twice? I was 11 weeks done without any problem at all...

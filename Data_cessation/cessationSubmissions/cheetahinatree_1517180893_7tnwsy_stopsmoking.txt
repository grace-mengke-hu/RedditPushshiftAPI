I quit because of this sub reddit update

I wanted to thank this sub for setting in motion some positive changes in my life. Since I quit smoking, 1 year 8 months and 26d ago, I've attended Unleash the Power Dallas, stopped drinking, started biking to work, starting participating in a self mastery course, starting attending church, and most importantly I have become less critical of myself and really grateful. Big hearts to all of you on your journey.

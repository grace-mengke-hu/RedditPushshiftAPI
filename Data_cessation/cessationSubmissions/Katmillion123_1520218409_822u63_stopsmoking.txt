But I love it....

Hello all, I'm new here to this sub but figured out couldn't hurt to try. I know I need to quit smoking, I want to quit smoking, but I don't really really WANT to. I can't help it I love the shit (even though it stinks, it's expensive and it's hindering my workouts). Why is it so damn addicting??? Why do I feel like I "need" it so bad? I can go without it, I've proven that it's not a big issue when I go all day at work or wake up and realize OMG I DON'T HAVE ANY CIGARETTES!!!! But at my next given opportunity I'll run in and buy some and break my 12 hour, 24 hour or even 2 day streak of being smoke free. Any advice or success stories y'all would like to share? I really need the motivation to just do it....

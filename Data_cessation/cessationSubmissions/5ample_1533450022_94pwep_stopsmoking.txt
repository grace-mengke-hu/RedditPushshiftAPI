Quitting smoking after around 100 cigarettes

Hi, I apologize in advance for this post as I know a lot of people have been smoking a lot more than I have. However I've been feeling immense regret lately because I used to chain smoke during times of deep depression in the past. I quit smoking around a little less than 100 cigarettes, but I have huge regrets about what I've done because it was a stupid choice. What are the long term damages I can expect, and is there a way to lower the risks of future health implications. Thank you in advance.

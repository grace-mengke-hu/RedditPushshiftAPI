It's getting easier.

I still want to smoke at times, but it's just sometimes and for a moment. I don't even feel that same full body desire screaming at me that it will fix all the problems in my life by...by...I can't even remember what the reasoning that I lied to myself with anymore.
Was it by giving me a headache? A sore throat? Was it because I wanted to taste the toxic smelling smoke my friends exhaled? Did I want to spend an extra 2 hours a day in the Florida summer against my will? Did I want to keep listening to people telling me to quit as being on their high horses? Did I want to keep getting winded after walking practically no distance and being unable to run? Did I want to seem like white trash? I certainly don't need any extra help being broke.

I can't remember why I did it. I won't forget the pain of being a slave that brought me to the point that I wanted to change. I won't forget that I quit for me because I certainly smoked for my own reasons.

Finally stopped

I smoked from 1969 to 1998. Stopped for 15 years and then started again and lit up for another five years.  What an idiot.  
Have been smoke free for 10 days now. I live with a smoker who has no plans to quit so Lurking here and reading other peopleâ€™s successes and contingency plans for moments of stress or longing are very powerful help tools. Thank you.

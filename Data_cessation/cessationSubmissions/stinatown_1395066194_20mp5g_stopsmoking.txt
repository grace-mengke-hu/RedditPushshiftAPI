Spent the weekend walking around outside... without smoking!

I went to visit my friend in Manhattan this weekend. We spent Saturday walking around Central Park, eating outside, walking from destination to destination. We've done this a thousand times, and I've always had a cigarette burning as we walked home from brunch, or immediately after we stepped out of the movies, or as soon as we finished a picnic lunch. 

But this time, I did all of those things without smoking. And you know what? It actually felt good. I've been so scared that I would be tempted, but I was so caught up in having a good time that I didn't really care about not having a cigarette. 

I've been scared of a lot of things after smoking. I still haven't gotten drunk since I quit. I'm scared that I'll have cravings when I go to music festivals or the beach this summer. I'm scared that I won't be strong enough to resist the urge, or that the experience will be less fun without cigarettes. But this weekend confirmed that I can still be myself, and have a good time, without cigarettes there. 

It's kind of like getting through a break-up. I will survive!

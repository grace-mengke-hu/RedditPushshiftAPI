The best cigarette you ever had

I’m beyond pleased on how this quit has gone. I’ve more energy, I sleep better, I can breathe better and the cravings haven’t even been that bad. I’m now at a point where everyday life is not dominated by the thoughts of cigarettes and it’s like Joel says - I’m learning to do everything I did as a smoker just as well as before, if not better. 

What I am struggling with though is the fantasy of the ‘best’ cigarettes. I’m able to remember my everyday smoking for what it was but there are certain cigarettes that I literally cannot imagine life without:

- on summer holidays, drinking and smoking until the sun goes down
- having a smoke with a coffee when skiing
- at a wedding, having a smoke in the evening party

These, thankfully, are things that I will do rarely but I’m irrationally worrying that they won’t be as fun without cigarettes. I know smoking is an all or nothing proposition for me now so I can’t just have them at these times. 

Any advice from long-term quitters here? Do I just have to do it once and realise these things aren’t so bad without cigarettes?

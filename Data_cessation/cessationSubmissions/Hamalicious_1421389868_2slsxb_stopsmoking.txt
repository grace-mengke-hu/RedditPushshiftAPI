After 25+ years I'm done with smoking!

Hi guys, I'm 40 years old, I started smoking when I was 13 and have been a consistent pack a day smoker since I was 15. It wasn't a New Years resolution or anything but I just got it in my head that it was time. I'm going the E-Cig route and couldn't be happier. I started with 12mg juice which was low for me so I was a bit jittery the first day but nothing like trying to go cold turkey. I thought it would take longer to adjust but now I'm feeling confidant and will lower the nicotine strength next week. Anyway just thought I'd share my experience so far, if your struggling to quit and think the e-cig might be for you; visit /r/electronic_cigarette or /r/ecr_eu .

19 days and counting

I've smoked for over 30 years, around a pack a day, sometimes more.  Back in August I found out that I have COPD.  I started taking Chantix, I didn't take quitting very serious, I guess.  I thought I could just cut back and be ok.  Then on Feb 1st I ended up in the hospital because of the COPD, and spent the next  6 days there.  Now it's been 19 days and I'm still feeling like a wreck.  I think about it a lot.  My son has a vape.  I tried and liked it because it gave me the inhaling sensation that I miss so much.  But I am not going to start that.  

I also smoke weed.  I started using a small hitter and smoke a ton less than I normally do.  But I wonder if even the little I've been smoking is making it harder to quit the cigarettes.  I have cravings all the time.  So my son says I should make edibles.  My first attempt was way too potent for me.  I was high for over 24 hours, seriously.  So now I'm afraid to eat anymore brownies.  

The question in all of that is does smoking even a little pot making it harder for me to stay cigarette smoke free?  The cravings are intense!  I wake up and my first thought is "you can't have a cigarette"  I tried the positive thoughts strategy, but it all feels phony.  I can say "wow, you've made it 19 days without a cigarette" but in my head I think "I wonder how long this will last"

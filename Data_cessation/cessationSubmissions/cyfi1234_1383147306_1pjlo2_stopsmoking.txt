Quit smoking for a while then started again... any advice about getting back on the horse?

I quit for 9 months and got to the point that even the thought of smoking again repulsed me, but I had the urge to start again one day and spiraled down the path of becoming a social smoker. Any advice on how to get motivated again would be helpful... I really want to cut it out of my life again...

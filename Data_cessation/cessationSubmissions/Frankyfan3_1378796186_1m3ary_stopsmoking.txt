Avoiding my parents

Normally I visit my folks for a little bit once every week or two. They are a very short detour on my way home from work & I'll often smoke one with my mom & catch up before I head home.

I don't really want to tell them I've quit because I don't want to project any superiority as they've made it abundantly clear they love to smoke & deem it a hobby rather than a vice. Also don't want to disappoint if I relapse. Even though my parents are smokers I was ashamed to tell them for years after I started. When I finally broke down & lit up with them it was a bit of a bonding experience, as crazy as that sounds. 

Since I'm on the family plan with my phone I eventually need to stop in to pay my bill & say hello. 

Since they smoke menthols & I never got a taste for them I know I'm not in danger of bumming one, but it's going to be tough to cope with the urge to buy my own pack when I see them. 

Argh. I've not even been at this a week &it feels like most of my success had been from avoiding temptation but I don't want to avoid my parents.

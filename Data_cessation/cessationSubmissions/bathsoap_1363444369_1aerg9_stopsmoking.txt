Whats your opinion on e-cig with no nicotine?

hey reddit.
I have quit for 4 days now, haven't had one cigarette and doing it cold turkey.
one thing i miss is just talking shit at home with my house mate over a cigarette.
or just therapeutically watching the smoke rise from my mouth.

Ive had an e cig before with nicotine and it was average but theres new features for them now and you get more of a throat hit and more smoke.

so whats your opinion on e cig's with no nicotine? viable quitting tool or is it just a band aid?

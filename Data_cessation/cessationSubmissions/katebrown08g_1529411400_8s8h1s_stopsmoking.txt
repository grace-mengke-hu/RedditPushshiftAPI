Quit Smoking Two Days Ago, but boyfriend says he will smoke forever.

Well I’ve finally decided to actually quit smoking for real this time. I just had my 28th birthday, which puts me at 10 years smoking. Enough is enough! I always wanted to quit by 30, but 2 years early sounds good too! 

My question is does anyone on here have trouble with their significant other being a smoker? We’ve been together 5 years and talk about marriage a lot. But he has always told me that he will always be a smoker - no compromise possible. How will I be able to live my life smoke free if he’s still puffing like a chimney? 

Also, I always think to myself, well they say 2nd hand smoke is as bad as first hand and since  I’m still getting that, why not just smoke it myself?

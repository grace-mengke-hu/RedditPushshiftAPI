3 months in

I was a smoker for about 15 years and quit 3 months ago. I feel like I should be proud but am not at all and am ready to start up again. The ONLY thing stopping me is I made a promise to my 4 year old that I wouldn't smoke anymore. It just gets very discouraging at times. I don't feel any different, don't have any more energy, etc. But the most discouraging thing is that my severely overweight husband said how proud he was and vowed to lose weight to be healthier for our kids and hasn't lost a pound. TBH I think he has gained. I know that quitting smoking was the best thing I could do for myself but sometimes I feel like what's the point.

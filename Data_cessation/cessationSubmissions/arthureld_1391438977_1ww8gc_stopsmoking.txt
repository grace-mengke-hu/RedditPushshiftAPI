Just over a week, time for some other changes in my life

I've been nicotine free for just over a week now. Other than the first 4 days (which were all pretty much continuous hell), the cravings have backed off (still come, but I find a handful of cravings easier to deal with than near constant ones).

I decided to use a small fraction of the money I'm saving to invest in a good gym membership this weekend and now I'm harvesting some of the new energy and ability to breath (I actually, like, ran today and didn't pass out!) to make some other changes my body need.

I've been morbidly obese for years. Just like smoking I've tried to change that many times (often, like when I tried quitting, with various fad methods or shortcuts), so I'm hoping the willpower that I've discovered in myself with all the help from /r/stopsmoking can also be used to lose some weight the old fashioned way. Hopefully this can keep off some of the post-smoking weight and shed some unwanted poundage.

Any one else out there have experience with this? My biggest concern is taking on too much at once. That said, working out an hour a day and doing some calorie counting (not starving myself for sure, just trying to choose good options for snacks and meals rather than my "go-to" carb&sugar-heavy items) and cutting out sugar soda (probably still diet for now, but eventually I will try to cut out soda completely) doesn't feel like *a lot*.  

EDIT: Forgot how sentences work

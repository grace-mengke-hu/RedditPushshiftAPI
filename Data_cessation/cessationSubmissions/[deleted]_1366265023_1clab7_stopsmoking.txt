Any ex-cigar smokers?

I'm talking about Swishers, not legitimate cigars. I smoked at least one a day for a couple years, and I just quit. I'm wondering if the withdrawal symptoms are the same as for cigarettes. It's been 9 days and I still feel intense cravings for a cigar. Shouldn't this be subsiding quite a bit right about now?

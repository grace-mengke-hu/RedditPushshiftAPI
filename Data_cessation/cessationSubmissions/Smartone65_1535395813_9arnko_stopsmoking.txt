Struggling for the 1st time in 57 days...

Bad start to the day, didn't sleep well. Maybe I'm needing a pat on the back but today is the first day I've really been close to tears from stress and I'm actually wanting relief. Before, that relief would have come from a cigarette. Today, that won't happen because I DON'T SMOKE. Keep me in your thoughts today because I know you're all out there, virtually rooting for me! Thanks, friends. ðŸ™ƒ

Day five on an electric.. man I am gasping for a real one!

Its strange though, last time I used an electric it was for cutting down and I smoked just at evenings and on my days off from work, but much less than before, and I stopped coughing after a few days.  This time I haven't even smoked in the eves or this weekend and I am still coughing like an old man.  I can see I will go back to the eves and weekends smoking, just trying to give my lungs and arteries a break.  Anyone used an electric as a cutting down/cessation tool?  Any tips?  Thoughts?

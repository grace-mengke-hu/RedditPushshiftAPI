Hi, I'm 17 years old(turning 18 tomorrow!) and I've had smokes here and then for the past 1,5 years. Always in weekends when going out, never through weekdays. I never bought smokes myself, my friend always had them so I never had to put up with keeping leftovers that we didn't smoke. I was never addicted, I never had the urge to smoke through weekdays. Two weekends back, I decided I got my own pack because I got sick of asking my friend for a smoke all the time. I didn't smoke the whole pack, and so I got "stuck" with half a pack after the weekend. We went to the beach, and smoked some more. Then I smoked one on my walk to school, and then yesterday evening after work. I'm still not convinced I'm addicted, but that might be deniability right? I don't smoke everyday, mostly 2-3 days in between them, and everytime I do have one, I don't fancy one for a couple days after. Since I've been keeping up not getting addicted(on a daily bases) for 1,5 years, my question is what your advice would be? Can a couple smokes in the weekends hurt? Do you think from hearing my story that I am addicted? Should I stop at all? Please no "smoking is bad!!" comments, I know that, point is: I like social smoking with a couple beers. I don't do it to look cool.

Thanks in advance!

Day 4 (what!!): back at work, drinking coffee, did not smoke!

One of my coworkers and I like to go get coffee and then hang out outside for a bit while I smoke a cigarette. I was nervous about getting coffee with her today because I thought the cravings might be awful, but it was totally fine! I told her I'd quit, we got our coffee, we sat inside (which was a nice change), and we went back to work. Easy peasy.

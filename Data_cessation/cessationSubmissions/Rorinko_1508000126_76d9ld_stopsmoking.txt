Today is the day

I was smoking 20 ciggarets per day for 8 years. 1 year ago i quit smoking, big shotout to Alen Kar, but 2 months ago i had a really bad day and for some reason i let it smoke 1 cigarette, felt awful, week later it was all over again, 10-15 ciggarets a day. Today is a day, i will never get a ciggaret once again in my life, they dont have ANY pros. Everyone have a bad day, dont smoke even once if you broke with this guys.

It's been two weeks without a smoke, and I still haven't felt any symptoms. Is this normal?

Have any of you gone this long without symptoms? I haven't had a headache, or nausea, or even really cravings. The only thing that's bothered me has been habit related, like reaching for my cigarettes while driving, or wondering how long it's been since I've smoked. Other than that I feel totally normal. I'm not complaining by any means, I'm just a little concerned.

Oh, and has anyone started grinding their teeth after quitting? It started for me three days ago, though I believe it is stress related, as I have some serious stuff going on in my life.

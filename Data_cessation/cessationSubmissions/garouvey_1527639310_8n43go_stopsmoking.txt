Quitting Smoking Poppers?

This is my first post on reddit so if I put this in the wrong place / format I apologize and please do let me know!

I've been smoking poppers almost every day for 3 years now. There's a few different terms for it , but it's when you mix tobacco and weed and smoke it through a bong. I opt to rip off a piece of the cigarette, stamp weed on top and smoke it. It produces a much shorter but intense high. That wore out after a while, so now I have to smoke a lot more, much faster, for anything close to that effect. I don't even keep track of how much I smoke, so I'm not sure how much of a need I've developed.  

The weed isn't the problem, it's the tobacco. But, I don't really ever smoke weed without the cigarette \(and vice versa\) anymore and I'm not even sure what part of the process I'm addicted to. Hell, there's been a handful of times I've had dry spells with weed but still smoked just the tobacco through the bong. Although if the opposite happens and I've run out of cigarettes, I'll usually just not get high at all. 

I've been told / have seen what it can do to people, and I've been lucky not to have developed any issues so far. I don't know how to tackle the issue because I'll keep convincing myself I'll slow down and eventually stop, but had to face the reality of it when I got my wisdom teeth out a week ago, and packed gauze in my mouth the next morning just to smoke. 

I don't even know if this is supposed to be in this subreddit \(or if this made sense\) but I'm just confused and I don't know why I have such a problem with this specific thing when I've never had any prior addictions to any substances I've used before.  Any help would be greatly appreciated because I'm lost on what to do and I can't find it in myself to reach out to anybody in person about it. I don't know, man.

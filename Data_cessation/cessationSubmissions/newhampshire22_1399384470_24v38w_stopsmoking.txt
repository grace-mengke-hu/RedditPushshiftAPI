Huge benefit of quitting nicotine

I recently met a wonderful lady with many rare qualities that I am attracted to.  Well I just finished my second date with her and scheduled a third.  It's not a big deal, but I'm happy.  My quitting of nicotine helped me achieve this happiness for several reasons. 

1)  A mutual friend helped arrange the first date.  I made this friend when quitting nicotine.  I don't think she would have tried to arrange this date with a non-smoker for a smoker. 

2)  I have confidence that I wouldn't have if I smelled like cigarette smoke.

3)  I am not anxious when I don't have nicotine.  This is huge.  It's hard to explain why you're anxious when you're getting to know someone.  Sometimes rushing off to have nicotine can send the wrong signal.  

There are so many reasons to quit smoking, this is just one more.  

Oh, I also have been going to the gym.  I gained weight right after quitting.  The gym was the best way to remove that side effect.  Replacing smoking with the gym is a good idea.

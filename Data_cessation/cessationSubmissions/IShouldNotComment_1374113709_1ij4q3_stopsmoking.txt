I need help @ 1 month

I read Allen Carr's book and I was so thankful to not have to smoke cigarettes anymore. However, now that I've forgotten how much smoking sucks I am starting to think I want to be a smoker again. I really don't want to go back to that nasty habit, and I know deep down that it sucks to smoke, but i'm having troubling thoughts about going back to being a smoker. Maybe if I just keep reading Allen Carr's book every time I start to have dumb thoughts like these I will be safe. It seems like this is the final battle in my mind over whether I will be a smoker or not, and I need logic to win over my former drug-addict mindset.

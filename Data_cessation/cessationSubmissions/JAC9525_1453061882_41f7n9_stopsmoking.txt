Day 1.

Going good so far. About half way through the day. Decided to quit last night, and have stuck with it. 

Only thing I'm noticing so far is a bit of irritability, and that every now and then I get the feeling that I have to go outside to smoke, and then I feel uncomfortable. The feeling is almost like hearing someone knocking on the door and then intentionally ignoring it. 

I know that I'm already starting to feel better, and I'm doing well reminding myself that in the long run, it'll all be worth it. 

Good luck fellow quitters!

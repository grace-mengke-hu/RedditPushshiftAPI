Quit smoking for 3 years then started again for the last 1 year. How the fuck do I quit this shit guys??

I started smoking when I was around 13 at school. The older guys would give me cigarettes. Quit when I was 16 and started doing sports, eating healthy and not drinking alcohol at all.

I'm 20 now. 1 year ago I started smoking again while partying. I'm trying to quit it for several months now. I watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggo4T75ZntE). I knew most of that stuff about nicotine. I experimented with some hard drugs and realize that nicotine is very, very addictive even comparing to them.

I just want to quit this destructive habit. I stopped smoking for 7 days and then for 10 days in the past months but every time I relapse, it usually happens when I'm drinking or feeling stressed.

I know you might not have the time or need to give me any advice but please. I really need some concrete, practical advice on getting my life together. How did you do it?

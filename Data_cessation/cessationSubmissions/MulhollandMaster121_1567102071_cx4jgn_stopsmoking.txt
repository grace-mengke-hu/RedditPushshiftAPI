I have not had a cigarette in 21 days

For about 13 years I’ve been a very heavy smoker (2+ packs a day). But 3 weeks ago I ditched the cancer sticks and fully replaced them with the e-deathstick (the Juul). I know it’s not great and I’m probably even more chemically dependent on nicotine now but still. It feels awesome to not smell like shit anymore and to be breathing noticeably better. 

I know the next step is to scale back the Juul use but I think it’s an important thing to note when you’re trying to give up this addiction: you can’t let perfection be the enemy of good. Which I know sounds like a cop out, but truthfully there aren’t many things out there quite as self-destructive as cigarettes. So whatever it takes to kick them to the curb, do it. Even if it’s baby steps. 

I know it’s not much to be proud of, but screw it. I have never gone this long without a cigarette before. So I’ll take it as a win.

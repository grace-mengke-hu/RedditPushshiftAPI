I'm really sorry guys.  I messed up again and I'm off the wagon again after 21 days.

It's been a rough week and in the end my emotional mind couldn't be held back by my logical mind.  Between shit at work and my personal life involving a girl I've liked for a while and my good friend now dating her after meeting her for the first time a few days ago, I just want to die... I mean I won't do that intentionally, but you guys know what I mean.

You all are an inspiration and got me going for a total of 46 smokeless days this year, which is the longest I've ever gone as a smoker.

As of today, I'm removing my badge.  Once my heart recovers from this little debacle, I'll start over at day one.  Until then, I'm going to light up and cry at how much of a failure I am in more than just quitting smoking, but as a man.

This is my promise to you all; I WILL BE BACK AND I WILL CONQUER THIS EVIL FIRE DEMON ONCE AND FOR ALL.  However, the demon wins this round today.

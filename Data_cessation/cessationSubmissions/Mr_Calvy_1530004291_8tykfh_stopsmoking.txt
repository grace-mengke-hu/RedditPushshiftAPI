Over 1 year clean!

Over a year ago I made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/6hasa5/resetting_my_400_day_flair_were_doing_this_again/) post.  
  
Just a quick update to say smoking is finally behind me! Out of the last 3 years, I've abstained for 2.6 and it's been 370 days since my last smoke. Stick with it, life is much better without that disgusting habit!

I need to stop smoking. I need my fellow redditors to help me!

Obligatory: not a native speaker. Sorry about my grammar and spelling. 

I am almost 40. My life took a turn 2 years ago. My dad had a stroke and, because I took his role in the family, stress, responsibilities, etc happened. 

Result: I started smoking way more than I should. 

But not long ago (3 months) I met someone so extraordinary that made me think about my life choices. I could not be more thankfull for his presence in my life. **(Brandon, if you ever read this, I love you. And when I say I love you, means all kinds of love that can possibly exist among 2 people. I respect, admire and adore you. You came to add so many things in my life that I did not know could be possible in a relationship with someone else. &lt;3)**

Anyways, I NEED to stop smoking! I tried once, failed miserably. The trying resulted in shaking, more stress, etc etc etc. 

One note is that at the same time I want to quit, I feel pleasure with the whole ritual: opening the pack my way, using my zippo to light it, smoking after a cup of coffee, etc etc etc. 

So, my fellow redditors... help? What can I do? 

Thank you so much for the attention in advance. &lt;3 ---;---{@

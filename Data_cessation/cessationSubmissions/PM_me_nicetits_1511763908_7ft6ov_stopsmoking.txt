I've been smoke free one week.

I've been smoke free one week. I can already tell that I jump from a 0 to a 5 when I get irritated. Its going to be both easy and difficult to keep this up. I don't think I should drink. If I drink, I'm going to want a cigarette. Quitting is a decision I need to follow myself. On some level, I want to smoke because I know it's bad. What I need and want is the mindset of not smoking because I know its good.

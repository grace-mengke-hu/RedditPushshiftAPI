No More Nicotine for Me, Proceeding with Caution

The last cigarette I smoked was January 20 at 10:33 p.m.

I took off my last patch (21 mg) on Thursday, February 21 around 10 p.m. I know I *should* have completed the step down program, but I felt I was ready. The patches irritated my skin, and I wanted to scratch my arm off the last day I wore one. I couldn’t have quit without the patch. I know I needed a backup plan of some nicotine while I worked on the habits and the triggers and trying to avoid doing that hand-to-mouth motion I use to do 240 times a day. I decided I could switch NRT if need be, I had nicotine gum and the nicotine inhaler, and I carried an unwrapped patch in my purse. 

Nevertheless, I decided to move forward without nicotine.

The first day without nicotine was a Friday, and I managed to stumble through the day. The Saturday with no nicotine was a horrible blur. I had that “brain fog” I had when I first quit cigarettes. Sunday was a little better than Saturday, and Monday I was SUPER irritable. Now it’s Tuesday and I feel better than the day before. The cravings are still there but they seem to be shorter in length than they were before.

I plan on remaining super-duper vigilant to get through this. I’m still carrying NRT in my purse, because any NRT is better than a cigarette. 

This is the longest I have gone without a cigarette or nicotine in 22 years.  

Anyone else quit NRT early and relapse?  Or was it all smooth sailing?

I want to quit but so many failed attempts have me worried.

I know this isn't the right attitude to have when trying to quit (yet again) However in the past I was so motivated and enthusiastic only to give in to smoking again and again. Any advice to someone who wants to quit but really no longer believes it's possible. I'm 26 and I've been smoking consistently for 9 years. 

*Edit : The thing that really gets me is I work in an office with numerous other smokers who are more than willing to supply me when I 'leave' my ciggs at home

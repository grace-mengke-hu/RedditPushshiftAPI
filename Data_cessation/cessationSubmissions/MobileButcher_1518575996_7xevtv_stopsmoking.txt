Only one week...

First post here...It’s been one week since I had a cigarette. I’ve been smoking for the past 15 years. I will be turning 30 this year...it’s crazy to think I’ve smoked for half my life already. But enough is enough. Sick of coughing. Sick of stinking. Sick of blowing money on something so dumb! So I just decided to try to quit. No vape, no patches, gum, etc. This past week has been pretty rough honestly. I can’t believe it’s only been a week...feels like I’ve been craving it forever already. I know it will get better eventually. Gotta stay strong. One week down, the rest of my life to go. I’ve got this...but I hope it starts to get a little easier.

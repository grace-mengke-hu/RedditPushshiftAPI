I'm on my 6th day smoke free!

Hi, My app gave me this site to come to and I sure am glad they did! I need a support group! I didn't quit cold turkey, I'm on the NicoDerm CQ patch and on my 6th day without a cigarette. Boy, Does it feel great! I've smoked for 33 years about a pack 1/2 a day. Really glad I found this site!

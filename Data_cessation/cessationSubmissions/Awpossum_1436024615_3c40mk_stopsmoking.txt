Change my view on cigarettes

Hello everyone, I'm here because I want to stop (I tried to stop several time, and I didn't smoke since yesterday). The reason I fail is not because of the lack of nicotine I don't think, but more because I've always seen cigarette as a cool and overall positive thing (on a subconscious level).
I've always liked the smell of it, even when I was a kid, and I started smoking as soon as I could (which wasn't that young luckily, around 16). I am now 18 and I really think cigarettes are bad for my health, I have no doubt regarding that but I really don't know how to change my view on cigarette and see it as something negative.

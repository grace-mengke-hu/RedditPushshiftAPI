I caught a cold this week...

...and really, it's not been so bad :) I only realised it was probably a cold and not just feeling tired from early mornings when I developed a cough. I haven't really had a cough since April (I quit at the end of January) and I suddenly remembered that I used to cough almost every day. I definitely haven't missed it!

Thank you cold, you've given me another excellent reason why it's important to stay strong and prevent a relapse. Embrace your next sniffles, people, it's only temporary but it's reminded me of how things used to be almost all of the time. The other side is definitely a lot more fun :)

Just Started!

Hi friends, I'm 22 years old and after smoking for roughly 6 years I have made the decision 167 minutes ago to stop smoking. I picked up a box of the gum and so far it is going smooth but I am really nervous! Im sure this must get posted here all the time but can you offer any tips/encouragements/stories to help me through this next week (which I am told is the most difficult part). I was also wondering is it counterproductive to allow myself 2 or 3 smokes a day or is it best to completely replace smoking with the gum? Thanks =]

I survived my first big test of willpower!

My last cigarette was October 22. Due to some massive bad luck, I ended up in the hospital for a couple months, the first few weeks of which I was in and out of consciousness. I joke around that it's been the easiest way to quit smoking, what with being doped up and mostly unconscious through the withdrawals. I've been home for three weeks and after using some advice I got here, I have avoided any cravings.

My biggest worry was drinking, as that was when my cravings would be the strongest before the hospital. But today I got off of home health care and got the okay to go to the bar. I did get a couple cravings, but I was able to shut them down! One huge step in my smoke-free future!

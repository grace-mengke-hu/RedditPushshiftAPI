Suggestions on quitting the habit, not the nicotine addiction.

Alright, I smoke about 2-3 packs a week so I really don't smoke that much. Sometimes it is more, depending on the weather and how often I am outside and what not, but that isn't my concern.  
  
What I came here to ask is: What are some good ways to quit the habitual smoking? Like smoking in the car on my way to work, or when I wake up in the morning, or before bed at night. I quit for 2 years before and I don't feel like I smoke enough that the addiction to nicotine is that strong, but I *like* to smoke. I enjoy it when I am driving and when I take breaks at work. I really don't want to quit and I believe that makes it harder to actually do it.  
  
So basically, what are some suggestions on how to quit smoking when you really don't want to? $10 a pack is not that much when you only buy one every couple days, but it does add up to what I would estimate is $150-$200 a month that I spend on cigarettes and I feel like I could spend that on better things.

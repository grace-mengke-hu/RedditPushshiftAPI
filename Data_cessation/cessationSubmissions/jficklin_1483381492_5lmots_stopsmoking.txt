Reset The Badge. Ready to Start Again

Alright. Haven't stopped by here in a bit. Back in September I started up again after 100+ days of being smoke and nicotine free. One smoke every two weeks quickly turned in buying packs every other day or so. It got out of hand real quick. 

Here to remind you all that casual smoking is not an option. Just a one here and there while drinking will land you right back where you started. Anyway, here we go. Fresh start. I'll be checking in here regularly to keep myself accountable. Let's do this!

Thanks!

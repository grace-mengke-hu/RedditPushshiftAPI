Suicidal at 1 month

I'm on my second attempt to quit smoking. The general consensus seems to be that the first 3- 5 days are the worst. And it only gets better from there on out. The weird things is, that when i hit the one month mark, I completely loose my mind.  I am by no means an angry person but since quitting i have fits of rage. And I am not really exaggerating here. I loose it. I mean, I cry 1- 5 times a day. I start thinking suicide is the only way out. Since the 1 month mark, I think about killing myself a couple times a day. This is completely unlike me. Also, I was bulimic 5 years ago, and relapsed since quitting. The kicker is, I am on the patch. Not really sure what to do. I don't crave cigarettes. Also, I am in a situation where the people I live with are adamant about me quitting. And I feel as if they would think I was lying about the suicide part. Any similar experiences? I don't have a desire to smoke, but I'm worried I might kill myself. Just a bit distraught.

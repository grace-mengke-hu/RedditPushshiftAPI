Quitting with no support.

I always blamed the fact that everybody i know even the ones i live with are smokers as the reason i never quit. Well I'm sick of feel pathetic. Wish me luck, because since this morning i haven't had a cig and I'm going to keep it that way.

I just want to say to everybody out there thats feeling like they're in a rut, it's literally all in your head. You don't even like cigarettes. If u smoke a cigarette you're going to need another in 45 minutes just so you could feel the way you felt before you started smoking. It's a counterproductive habit that doesn't make you feel good it makes you feel normal. The way you should feel all the time. It's deceptive. 

When you're out with friends they go out to smoke their ciggies you should think "thank god, i don't need to choke myself for 5 minutes to feel the way I'm supposed too" and still even then you can accompany them outside. It's not like they don't want you there. 

You might think that cigs give you an edge in your focus and concentration. That's also a lie, you've been that focused all your life. Until you started smoking cigarettes that is. 

Next time you see the awesome protagonist in your favourite film light up picture him in 20 years. In a hospital bed, hooked up to oxygen, with an ICD in his chest. 

Every time you think to smoke take a deep breath and let out only some air and try to breathe like that for the next 5 minutes. That's what emphysema feels like. 

I know this is a lot coming from somebody not even 24 hours in but everything i've said here is true. The addiction has tricked you into thinking you like cigarettes, you don't. You actually hate them, and so does everybody else who smokes. And sometimes you just need to hear yourself say it to others to believe it. This has been very therapeutic for me. Thanks for reading.

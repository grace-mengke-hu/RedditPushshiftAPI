Newbie here, don't know where to begin.

Does anyone have tip and or tools to get the ball rolling? I quit drinking three months ago and my smoking intake just about doubled. I've already seen the "I don't know what to do with my hands" sentiments on here and I feel the exact same way. Smoking helps with my social anxiety now I'm sober. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!
Also is it better to taper down or just quit cold turkey?

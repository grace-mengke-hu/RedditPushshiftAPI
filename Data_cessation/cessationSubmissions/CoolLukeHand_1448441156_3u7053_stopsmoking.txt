I am turning into what I used to despise and I love it :)

What I am doing to retrain my brain that smoking and everything to do with it is wrong, horrible and filthy is turning me into one of those anti-smoking people that I despised when I was a smoker. 

Don't get me wrong, I completely keep it to myself and it only happens inside my head but every time I find myself walking behind someone dragging on a gasper I walk across the road and shake my head telling myself that this is just unbelievable and shouldn't be allowed, filthy smokers. Don't get me wrong I would never say anything to anyone and have no interest or cares what anyone does to their own body, however if they could hear what i say in my head it wouldn't be good :)

I have to keep telling myself over and over and over that I hate smoking and if I had a cigarette it will not help or make me feel any better and just ruin everything I have achieved and set me back to square one and for what?!? What would it do for me versus what would I be giving back if I smoked. 

It seems to be working and by the time I have finished berating my brain, the desire for a cigarette has passed and I get on with whatever I am doing.

I have the 1 month in my sights and can't wait. I had to run for my train this morning and was delighted when the recovery time when i got to a seat was a lot shorter than it used to be. 

I think my taste buds are slowly becoming a bit more sensitive. This may just be coincidence but I used to shock my family with how much hot sauce I put on things.. now I am only able to take a fraction of what I took as a smoker.

Day 1........again *sigh*

This time I’ve made it three days before lighting up again, coughing my brains out, and deciding that this is yet again the last time. How many day ones am I going to have before I decide this is for good? 

I’m done having a shit ton of day ones. I’m done hacking up phlegm all fucking day and I’m done blowing wads of cash on something that does absolutely nothing for me.

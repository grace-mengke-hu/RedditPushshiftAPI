Today, today is the day!

I woke up today, deciding that after 2 and a half years of habitual smoking, I had finally had enough. So today marks the start of what i expect to be a difficult journey, but luckily I have some writing projects to occupy my time. Any tips on maintaining this healthier lifestyle and not reverting back to the ways of old would be greatly appreciated :)

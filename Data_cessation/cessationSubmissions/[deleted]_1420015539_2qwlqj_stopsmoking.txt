What is wrong with my ass...

Ok, this isn't the most ladylike thing to post, but Jaysus, my family needs an intervention! 

While I was smoking: fart occasionally, not very often that I notice. Husband says I sometimes fart in my sleep, but it's rare. And they don't particularly have any smell that either of us notice. 

After I quit smoking: Holy fucking ass trumpets Batman. Continuously fart the most noxious smelling farts in the history of farts. Farts smell so bad that the dog is offended, the kid's eyes keep tearing up and my husband of almost 12 years is rethinking all his life's choices right about now. 

What the hell is this shit and how do I stop it?

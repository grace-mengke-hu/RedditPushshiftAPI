The Deadly Widowmaker

A heart attack known as a “widowmaker” heart attack occurred to my mother a week ago. She was feeling chest pain for a few weeks beforehand, but shrugged it off as her hernia. They were miniature heart attacks. The finishing  blow was a widowmaker heart attack. She was rushed to the hospital by my dad around 4:00 in the morning. She was doing fine, until after they placed a stent in her heart. She lost her pulse. They got her back, but things were severely going downhill. The doctors were almost 100% sure she wasn’t going to make it. They were putting a tube in her (for reasons that have not been disclosed to me) and she sneezed, causing the tube to go off course and cause internal bleeding. There were blood clots in her heart that could break off and go into her brain at any time, which would be fatal. She wasn’t breathing on her own, and was unconscious. Doctors lost her once more that day, yet again resurrecting her. They days afterward the doctors kept telling us how she’s extremely lucky to be alive. She’s breathing and eating on her own, and talking, her blood pressure has been stabilized too. I dunno about the blood clots, but I think they’re gone too. The internal bleeding has ceased. She was in the ICU for 6 days, lost her life twice, and has a 6+ month road to recovery. 
Why is this in r/stopsmoking? They say the heart attack was caused by smoking. My mom is a smoker. Trust me, it’s a miracle she survived. Unless you trust your odds of surviving which is 3%, then I wouldn’t risk it. Smoking is not worth your life, and this case is just one of many complications that can occur when smoking. I’ve never been addicted, but I’m sure if you dedicate yourself to stopping, you’ll stop. Good luck!

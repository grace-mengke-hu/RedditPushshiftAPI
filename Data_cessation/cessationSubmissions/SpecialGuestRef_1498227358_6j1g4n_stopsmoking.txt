23 days.

I quit cigarettes and Copenhagen cold turkey on the 1st and have been good since. Replaced them with exercise and general healthiness. I tried to quit drinking at the same time and went 19 days no alcohol before stupidly spending a few days drinking (just a few in the evenings) on day 22 I was overcome with guilt and have picked back up. I no longer need candy or toothpicks and cigs seem pretty gross to me now. The bad smell is gone and I can't stomach it hardly when I'm around it. Alcohol will definitely be harder for me and i still haven't truly decided if I want to quit altogether. Thanks to this sub. Hang in there.

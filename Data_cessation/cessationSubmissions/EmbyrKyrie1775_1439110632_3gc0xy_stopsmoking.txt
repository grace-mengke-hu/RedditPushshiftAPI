Hiya, folks. I smoked for eight years, quit twice before and here we go again, third time's the charm, ya? *fingers crossed*

I'm just about 9 days in. 8 days 23 hours and 4 minutes. At about 5:50 this morning it will be officially the whole nine. Kind of exciting. I use nicotine gum, chewy ginger candy, and cinnamon sticks (it really helps to have something cigarette-shaped to hold and they have a pleasant flavor. Try it!) and a Stop Smoking app that I found on the google play store. It tracks the time and money saved and supposedly the health changes. It also has a nifty missions system to help you on your way, little things to do like putting the money you save daily into a jar to have a tangible reward at the end of...whenever. I actually found out about this subreddit through the app, so I thought I'd give it a try. ;) Hope all these strategies and great resources help me stay quit this time.

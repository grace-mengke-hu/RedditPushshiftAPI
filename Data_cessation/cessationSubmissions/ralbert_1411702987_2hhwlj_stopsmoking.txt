Ex-smoker wanting to vape

Hi guys, how are you doing? Hope all's is well. I'm currently at 18 days without a smoke, breathing fresh air, feeling relaxed, get the occasional pang, but once I remember how shitty my body felt (and smelled) after sticking one of those cancer sticks in my mouth and lungs, I decide I'm better of as a nonsmoker.

But still, ughh, the longing for my precious clutch, going out by the beach at night, watching the stars and remembering things worth remembering aren't the same with a glass of water or just a cup of coffee. I don't know what to do with my hands.

Recently I heard about electronic cigarettes with nicotine-free liquids (have no idea how it works) and I've been drawn to it. Sounds splendid, sounds like a healthier alternative. I don't want to smoke cigarettes ever again, I've been in nicotine's grasp and I don't want to be there ever again. But if there's something else to do, as a clutch, while everybody else clings to their cancer sticks, I could whip out one of those pen-looking electronic cigarette, and smoke other healthier chemicals into my body.

I don't know if I'm asking for advice, opinions, or just ranting on. Maybe it's the pangs talking, or maybe it's fear. What's your take on nicotine free liquids for electronic cigarettes? Have you used one?

EDIT: Thanks everybody, I still haven't decided on anything, but I think I'm going to wait it out a couple of weeks to see if my desire for a smoke goes away and I stay cigarette and e-cig free, or if I succumb to smoking vapors through an electronic pen-like thing. Thank you all for your kind comments :)

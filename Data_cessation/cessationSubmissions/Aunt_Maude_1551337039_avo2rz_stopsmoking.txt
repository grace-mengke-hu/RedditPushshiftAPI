Patchy patches

I am at 15 days of non-smokery, the last three days I was patchless but to be honest I struggled like hell yesterday so today I slapped a patch on and I dunno whether it's a placebo or what but today I seem to be coping a bit better. 

So to all you out there, I just want to say that whatever works for you, whether its patches, gum, knitting, whatever... so long as it gives you the strength to go another minute, hour, or even the next fucking few seconds without lighting up.. if it works you are winning! I am winning! Together we can beat this addiction. If you are struggling, say something here. It's not all about milestones (which are incredibly inspiring so please don't let me take that away from you) but it is a struggle sometimes. It is fucking hard sometimes. Reach out, we are all in the same boat, don't struggle alone.

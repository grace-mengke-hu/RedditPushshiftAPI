9 days since I decided to quit. Looking for advice.

So it's been over a week since I stopped smoking, was hooked for over 4 years. Cigarettes, weed, spliffs, you name it. I'm done with it, cold turkey. Honestly the cravings aren't happening as frequently, which is good. 


However my sleep has been pretty bad. The last 2 nights I've woken up in the middle of the night feeling nauseous, don't know if that's related to quitting. 


I was also hoping my appetite would come back, but it seems worse than when I was smoking. I was eating healthier when I was smoking.


I've been feeling lethargic and just shitty too. I was looking for a new job but since I quit smoking I've just been really unmotivated to keep looking. 


Anyone else experience these things? Any advice to get back on that horse and keep pushing forward?

9 days later...

I did stop once already, after reading Allen Carr's book, it was almost 1 year, but relapsed somehow, doesn't really remember, it was last august. So after smoking mostly regurarly for half a year, I decided not to anymore. I planned on starting woth the new year, somehow smoked 1 or 2 on the 1st of Jan, not a single one to this moment, which makes 9 full days. It's not that I have carvings, or not that bad. My mind somehow keeps whispering that I can have one. I would really appreciate some help from someone with more experience, what to do.
Thanks, and big thumbs up for Y'all!

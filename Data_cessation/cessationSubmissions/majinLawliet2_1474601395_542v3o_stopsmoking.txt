50 days: Sharing my experience

Hi good people

I joined this Reddit soon after I quit. Today is 50 days. Some background: 26 yo, smoked for 6 years... Was smoking ~6-8 cigarettes a day averagely. Quit cold turkey. 



Lessons learnt: 


1. Being determined helps. Just don't care about what that tiny monster in your mind wants. I won't smoke cigarettes. They are fucking addictive. Just repeated this over and over in my mind. 


2. Self control: Don't substitute cigarettes with carbohydrates. It'll lead to weight gain. I just slept off when I had cravings and chewed some gum/candy. 


3. Give yourself a reward every week: I buy a beer bottle every Friday to reward myself and roll a joint. I know it's kinda cheating when I smoke weed but not cigarettes. However once a week helps me. This is not a substitute. I don't crave to light up a joint every few hours. :)


4. Keep following r/stopsmoking for inspiration: seriously. This community is awesome. 



Cheers!

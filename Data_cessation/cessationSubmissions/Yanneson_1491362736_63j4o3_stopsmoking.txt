Rock bottom

Hey guys, first time poster here.

I know this may not seem like much of an achievement, but yesterday I was able to not go out and buy the usual pack of 20s I would consume in a day normally either at work or home. I have been a very heavy smoker for 7 years to cope with some bad jobs that have caused some great depression and anxiety. Although it does help get me through day to day, it's obviously not healthy. I am scared after a recent loss in the family due to smoking.

I've always used cigarettes as a way to cope. Whether it's physical or mentally. Substituted for food, which has landed me at an all time low of being underweight. 

I've seen people replace cigarettes with vaping, or chewing tobacco and such. But I'd rather quit cold turkey, go through the horrible withdrawal which has already consumed itself in the form of depression at the moment, and finally beat this shit.

One last thing - I appreciate it greatly if you have made it this far and listened to my nonsense. I have always been underweight most of my life, and I want to take this upcoming dark few weeks to turn my life around 180 degrees. I am planning on increasing quantity of meals throughout the day (healthy that is!), and starting off at the gym with some friends step-by-step to put on some healthy weight.

Thank you and good luck to all others attempting to quit. We are all on the same journey.

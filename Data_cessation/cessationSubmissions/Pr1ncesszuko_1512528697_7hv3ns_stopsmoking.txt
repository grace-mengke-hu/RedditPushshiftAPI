Actually pretty proud of myself

I just wanted to share this really proud moment with you guys. So I stopped smoking 2 weeks ago, I don’t use any nicotine products or anything. I do however have a vaporizer without nicotine that I use when I get a seriously bad craving. It doesn’t really make the craving go away but it helps to distract me a little and keeps my hands and mouth buisy and at least gives the illusion of smoking. 
But to get to the point. One of my biggest fears after quitting was working again. I work at a club on weekends and I am allowed to smoke on the job at any time as long as I don’t neglect my actual work. And that’s basically what I did every time I worked when I had to pass a few minutes or when I had a little break etc. Basically I would smoke A LOT, additionally basically all my co workers are smokers. 
I called sick into work (actually was sick though too) the first weekend after quitting but then I had to work this past Saturday. Had a new co worker. She smoked.. a lot. I brought my vape to be safe. 
And I actually made it. I didn’t think I would but I stayed strong. It was a busy day /night too so there wasn’t too much time anyways but even when I could have I didn’t. I only had to use my vape once throughout the entire evening. 

That really and truly felt like a huge accomplishment 💪🏻

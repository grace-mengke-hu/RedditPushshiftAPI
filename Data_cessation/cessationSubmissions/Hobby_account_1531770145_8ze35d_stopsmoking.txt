Can I safely enjoy a social smoke,

Im 21, smoking on and off about 3 years, became full time smoker for about a year smoking 3-5 per day and that’s when I decided to quit while I can before I really get hooked.

Im now smoke free 7 weeks and it’s easy, I don’t think about cigarettes and when I do it’s usually revolting.

But I’m just wondering if anyone has been able to quit but still enjoy one or two cigs on a night out with a few drinks?

Last week I was at a party and wasn’t even drinking, but decided I’d bum one off a friend. It was a mix between wanting that social smoke, and also curiosity to see how I would react to it.

I didn’t particularly enjoy it and only smoked about half, but if I had a few drinks on me I’m sure I’d have finished it.

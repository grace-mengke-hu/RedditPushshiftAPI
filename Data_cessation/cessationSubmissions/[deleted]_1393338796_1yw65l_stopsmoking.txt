Morning, all. Day 2.

Day 2 over here (even though my badge doesn't say so - not sure why). 

Like another recent poster, I decided to use the flu as a motivator to quit. So I'm home from work and, for the time being, feel too miserable to really think about smoking. 

Hopefully I can get through the physical dependence part without too much trouble thanks to the flu. Anyway, wish me luck.

Day 6 - I think its gonna work this time.

Just getting this off my chest I suppose.  Smoked since I was 15 years old (35 now).  This isn't my first attempt to quit smoking - and hopefully it will be my last.

Couple of weeks ago I told my wife that shortly before our next trip to Costco to pick up the Kirkland brand of smoking cessation chewing gum.  Reading the instructions it says to go through a complete X day period.  I didn't last with the gum but for a few days only because it says that you cannot eat and or drink for 15 minutes before chewing the gum.

For me, its kinda pointless because I'm one of those who like to drink coffee and or have a beer with a cigarette.  So I let myself go for a couple of days without the gum and I found that I can get along just fine without it either.

Now I know its natural for me to have a craving every now and then, but as of day 6 I've noticed that the cravings are less intense and more spread apart.  Is it all in my head now?  I have the gum beside me in case there's ever an incident where I want to run off to the market and pick up smokes.

My last cigarette was 6 days ago, coming back from the casino - I tossed out the half empty pack of cigarettes from my car while headed home.

Still at it....

It has been 28 days since my last [confession](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/6tm608/i_wont_miss/)....

This is a placeholder to myself, (in case anyone happens to be reading), to state that another month has passed and I am *still* smoking...

I am a regular over at r/stopdrinking, and I did indeed stop drinking around two and a half months ago, having been a heavy drinker for roughly 15 years...

My tobacco intake, however, is just as bad as it has been for the past 16 years, which is understandable, yet unsustainable....

Day 1 ~~may be~~ *is* looming ever closer.... I ~~may~~ *will* be spending some more time here very soon...

Many of my peers are also currently, actively, making efforts to free themselves from tobacco, with great success...

More thoughts to follow....

Is there any merit/ danger in moving your chosen quit date forward?

Hello, longtime Reddit lurker, this is my first post. I have picked out my quit date and have been spending time preparing for it. The reason I´m asking this question is as follows: fairly recently I purchased a carton of tax free cigarettes, believing that it would last just about right up to my quit date, and that I wouldn´t buy any more.
However it looks like those cigarettes will be gone a couple-three days before my quit date (shocking, right?) and now I´m sort of tying my brain into knots trying to decide whether it is safer to just buy another pack or two and stick to my chosen date, or if it might be as safe to simply move the date? 
I really want to quit this time and have been following good advice and preparing in advance, and I want to avoid doing anything that might torpedo my efforts. Does anyone have any thoughts to offer on the merits of sticking firmly to your chosen date, vs. moving it up or down a couple of days? Thanks.

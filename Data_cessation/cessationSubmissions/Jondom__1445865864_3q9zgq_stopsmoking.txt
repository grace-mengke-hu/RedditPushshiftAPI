Day 5 - Smokers flu intensifies

Alright if you read my post yesterday you know that I currently have the "smokers flu", it is getting worse, I am taking a couple hour break from vaping because every time I inhale I start coughing my lungs out. Food tastes 10/10 now and I still haven't gotten any cravings for cigarettes yet, yay!

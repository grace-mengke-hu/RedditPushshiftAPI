Starting over again today.

Hi, guys. I lapsed and went back to smoking a month ago. I have decided to come back. This girl I like is grossed out by smoking, and with lent starting today, feels like a good time to try again.

Any tips? This is like the fourth or fifth time I've tried, and I'm determined to be successful now.

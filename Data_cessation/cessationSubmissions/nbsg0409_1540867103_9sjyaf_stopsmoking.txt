Finally attempting to quit

Ok, so first time posting. Posting on mobile so yada yada format stuff...

Tonight I took my first Wellbutrin and I’m making my first real attempt to quit. I’ve had the “this is my last pack, my last cigarette” thoughts a lot over the years, but this is the first time I think I’m actually serious about it.

For background, I grew up in a smoking household. Tried my first cigarette at around 10-12 and finally became a habitual daily smoker at around 18-19 years old. I have had a pack/pack-and-a-half a day habit for 15 years. The doc says the Wellbutrin should stop the craving, but how do I stop the habit? The first smoke when I wake up, or smoking while I’m driving. Those are going to be the tough ones to break. 

Any help is welcome...just needed to put this somewhere. My husband knows what I’m doing but I haven’t told everyone...trying to keep it low key...(hedging my bets I suppose)

Juuling/ vaping?

So I finally quit smoking cigarettes because I started using the Juul to substitute, it’s worked really well so far and haven’t bought or smoked cigarettes in months. I know juuls aren’t great because they still contain nicotine but they’re supposedly better than cigarettes because they don’t contain tobacco or tar. I also don’t feel like I have to smoke for a set amount of time (like committing to a whole cigarette) so I smoke for shorter amounts of time (a few hits) but more frequently throughout the day (because it’s more accessible). I was wondering if anyone else does this/ other experiences with juuls/ vapes to quit smoking cigarettes?

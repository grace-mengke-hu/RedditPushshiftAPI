24 days of relapse and now my second day of recovery from smoking addition

After 3 years not smoking I had a relapse last month. From that first cigarette it took me 22 days to get back up to a pack a day. By not smoking for three years I saved myself 4500 dollars in cigarettes alone. The worst day was the first day of my quit. On top of the cravings I still had the consequences of smoking (cough, dry throat, wheezing, low energy) but it's day two now and most of the grumpiness is gone. My sinuses are getting better and my sense of smell is returning.


The last year was tough, it would have been tougher if I had smoked. One thing that helped me snap out of it faster this time was the realization that despite anxiety and stress that was above normal during the last year, I didn't light up. Now that the summer is over and I'm heading into new challenges, I am committed again to not smoking.


This sub helps me keep to that commitment as I know that many others are struggling today too and despite their challenges they are not going under. I will not smoke with you today. Thank you.

Edit: thank you to everyone who replied. I managed to stay free so far. Push-ups seem to help a little but knowing you are out there fighting the same fight and winning helps me believe I can do this.

Tomorrow is my day

I started smoking at 17, I'm now 34. Tomorrow is the 1st day i plan to quit for good. I'm quitting cold turkey. My husband, who is a smoker also, decided to join me. We've been preparing ourselves the best we know how. My car is my trigger and we cleaned it top to bottom today. Any suggestions out there to help? Especially driving an hr to and from work?

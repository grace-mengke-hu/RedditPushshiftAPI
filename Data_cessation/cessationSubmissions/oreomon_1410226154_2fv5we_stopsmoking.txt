How to stop headaches and extreme fatigue?

Hello all! I was 3 days in and I couldn't handle the headaches and fatigue anymore (I know I need to reset my badge). I stopped drinking coffee after I quit and found that I slept through most of the day with little to no motivation. Any tips to counteract this? Thanks

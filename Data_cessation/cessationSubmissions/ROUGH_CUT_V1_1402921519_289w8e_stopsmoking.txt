close call ...phew!

Today, there was another breakdown fight with my wife, which was the same reason I had a relapse about 11 days ago.  Today, however, I resisted running to the shop to grab a pack...  I had the resolve in my head that I was going to do it, especially in the midst of the hell.  And then I thought "no, not a whole pack, maybe I'll just get some papers and smoke from that half empty Bali Shag still sitting behind my desk at work."  But here I am at work, looking at that half empty pouch, and I still stand strong, even though my brain is still swelling from the stress of the argument.  Didn't buy the papers.  Just manned up and let it go.  Thought about my lungs and all that would be undone from the last 8 days and that helped a lot, as I've been chronically coughing, and I feel like it's finally letting up lately.  Anyhow,

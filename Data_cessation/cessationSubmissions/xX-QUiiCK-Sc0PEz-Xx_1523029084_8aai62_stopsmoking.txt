Day 13, all is well..ish

Hi guys, my smoking app told me to check this sub out which I thought was pretty cool.. So far everything has been going smoothly apart from today. Today was supposed to be my day off work to spend time with the family etc, but was called in to work, fair enough. Been told to do a lot of stuff but had customers keep coming into the shop causing me to stress a bit. This has brought on a few cravings and the desire to smoke is not high, but is higher than what it has been the past few days. Im not giving in. Even after 13 days I feel better than ever. Can't wait to reach a month, then 6, then a year.

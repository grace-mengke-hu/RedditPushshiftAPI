As of tomorrow morning, I will be an ex-smoker!

Hi all, long time lurker here. Never really had the courage to post before, even on previous quitting attempts. 

24 years old, been smoking since 14, and I've finally decided that enough is enough. 

Not sure why exactly I'm posting this. Partially so that when it gets tough I'll be able to look back at the feeling of excitement that I had when posting this, and partially cause I'm looking for advice. 

What helped you get through the tough times?

Also, if there's anyone that I can P.M. and reach out to when things get tough, you would be my hero.

Almost two years quit. I will never smoke again, but why am I still having intense cravings?

I will never smoke again. I want to see my 7 month old daughter grow up and graduate from college, and I'm an older new mom. I smoked on and off for about 15 or so years but I wasn't a heavy smoker after college. I didn't even smoke during the daytime for the last decade. I have been quit for over a year and a half, so why am I having a nic fit like I quit yesterday? It's killing me right now. Any insight?

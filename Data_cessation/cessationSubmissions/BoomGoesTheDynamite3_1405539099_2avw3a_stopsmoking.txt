Quit cold turkey, now other cravings are taking over!

Hey guys...I could use some help! I quit cold turkey last Wednesday...wasn't planning on it. I was taken to the ER by ambulance, couldn't breathe...big bad pneumonia. I was a pack a day smoker for 17 years (YIKES!) but now, I'm done...quitting for good.  And I'm ok with this...it hasn't been rough at all.  It's this non stop eating that's killing me!! I've even picked up sugar free mints, and they're not helping.  Any advice on how I can curb these non-stop munchies!?

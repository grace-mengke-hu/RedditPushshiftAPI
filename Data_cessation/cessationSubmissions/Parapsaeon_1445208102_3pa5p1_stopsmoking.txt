On day 3, triggered by a bad cold... Will it stick?

Am I at a disadvantage for quitting because of a cold? 

Had my last butt on Friday morning, Oct. 16. I caught a bad cold and simply didn't want to smoke. I'm 80% over the cold now and getting cravings. Obviously I know that not smoking is better than smoking, but will I have a harder time quitting because my body associates not smoking with being sick?

Additionally, any tips on quitting while living with smokers? My husband and MIL both smoke 1-2 packs a day. It's been easy to avoid it while I've been sick, but it'll be tough when they invite me to join them for a butt.

Trying again...

but I haven't got the same motivation to quit as I did last time. 

I started smoking when I was 14 and I'm turning 21 soon. None of my family are smokers so I've hidden it for nearly 7 years... that's ridiculous, right? 

I quit earlier this month for a grand total of 4 days. I switched to vaping but I ran out of juice and had to order some online. I had to wait days for the juice to arrive and I needed SOMETHING so I started smoking again. 

I really didn't want to. Although I'd only done 4 days I was already seeing benefits. So I had that first roll up and just carried on smoking, even when the juice arrived in the post. 

I was so ready to quit then. I was totally fed up with it. I want that mind set back. I bought lots of juice today and want to try quitting again tomorrow but I don't feel the same as I did last time.

Thinking of getting up early before work to exercise and show myself how unfit I've become. I'm 20 years old and feel about 70. I've got a million things going on right now but I don't think there will ever be a "right time" to quit.

Total rant, sorry. I'm thinking sharing might help because I can't exactly get support from my family.

I have no idea why I didn't smoke

I dropped smoking recently and yesterday I got relay frustrated over an argument and being treated unjustly by my gf. It was my first time in many, many years since I've been this angry and I really did want to smoke, I mean, at one point I had a cigarette in my mouth already and a matchstick drawn. I am not completely sure why I did not smoke a that moment or any other, but reading this Reddit previously had a part in it.
I just wanted to say thanks!

Wow! I can do this!

Wow! I only had two cigarettes Saturday and Sunday and those two cigarettes only consisted of a few dirty puffs! I thought to myself I could always have one Monday. 

I'm trying to hide my smoking relapse from someone so I don't want to smell of dirty smoke around them. Therefore, I try not to smoke when they are home.

This was easy! I wasn't even thinking of smoking!  I can probably quit again soon!

It's never been this easy! Hopefully I will allow myself to succeed.

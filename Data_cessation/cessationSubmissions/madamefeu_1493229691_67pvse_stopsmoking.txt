18 days! but still some worries..

After many attempts, this is the one!
All my last attempts were fucked because I decided to just take a puff after a couple of drinks. Never again. I don't even have the desire to drink (or smoke) this time.
I smoke pot though. It's not a problem with the cigarette cravings, I don't feel like smoking when I'm high. I don't smoke weed that much maybe half a joint per day.
Yesterday was the first day that I felt congested in my lungs and I coughed a lot. Today is worse, my breath is shortened, I have trouble being at my best at work. So, I guess this is what we call smoker's flu? My lungs are cleaning from the tar? Even if I still smoke pot on the regular? I used to smoke more or less a pack a day, since 2002. I googled a bit but I don't find answers with weed involved..

I need help

I wasn't even a smoker before I joined the Marine Corps.  I hate it. EVERYONE I know smokes. I'm constantly surrounded by it. Everyday. I buy packs and feel guilty and end up breaking all of them in half and throwing them away, like I just did. I don't even smoke a lot, like maybe 3 a day, but I know I'll become full on addicted if I don't stop. I have mild cravings when I don't smoke for a couple days, but its not bad at all. I usually do it cause I'm bored most of the time. I know my family would hate it if they found out I even smoked one cigarette. And I would feel ashamed if they found out. I didn't join the Corps to start smoking. I joined to better myself, to be more for and serve my country.

Day 1 starts.

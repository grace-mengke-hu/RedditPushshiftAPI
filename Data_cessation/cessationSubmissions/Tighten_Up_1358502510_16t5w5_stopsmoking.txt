Lapse

I was 9 days strong. For the past 4 days I forgot I even smoked for the past 8 years. Last weekend I got pretty wasted twice and was able to abstain. Tonight I went out and had a couple beers and smoked about 4-5 cigs. I don't know what made me light up that first one but I feel down about it. I also see how they do nothing for me but bring back that all to familiar sore throat. Badge being reset.

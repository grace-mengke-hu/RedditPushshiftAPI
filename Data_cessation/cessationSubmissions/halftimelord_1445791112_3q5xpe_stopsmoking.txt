257 days isn't a milestone

But that's not why I'm making this post.

One year ago today, one of my closest friends died of lung cancer. Neither he, nor nobody else knew that he had it. He was admitted into hospital, and died a few days later. He was only in his late forties. 

When I found out the news, the first thing I did, apart from cry and call my sister, was go outside for a fag - I could hardly roll it because I was crying so much. Some part of my brain must have noted the irony of my actions, but dat cognitive dissonance. 

I was shocked, and my anxiety spiraled almost out of control in the following months. Somebody I'd know for five years, and talked to almost every day of those five years was gone, and it was fucking surreal. 

However, a few months later, I made the decision to quit. I'd made half-hearted attempts before, but every time I lit up a fag, it felt like I was spitting in his face. It was horrible, and I didn't think I'd do it, but I took it one day at a time, and I haven't smoked since the last cold, drunken night of stealing fags from friends. 

As I reflect on this today, this is the only positive I can see. His death, pointless and horrific as it was, was the catalyst for my eventual quitting. And if this post makes anybody reconsider smoking, or even gives somebody just a tiny little push towards quitting, then his death won't have been as meaningless as it seems right now. I'm sure he'd agree with me.

Good luck to everybody here, regardless of whether you're on day one, or day one thousand, or not even on day one yet. And if you read all of this - thanks a lot. You can do it!

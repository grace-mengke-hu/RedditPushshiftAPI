Today is day 7

Today marks 1 full week without smoke inhalation. It's fair to say that it's probably been 20 years since this has happened...and I'm proud as can be!

Monday I'm looking forward to tackling the day with vigor, as the confidence I've gained as a result of not smoking is beginning to bleed into the rest of my life.

Many thanks to all for the support in the journey!

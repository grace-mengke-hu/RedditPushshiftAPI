Day 2 of not smoking!

Always said if my wife and I had a child I would quit smoking. On Tuesday the 14th of June, 2016 we had the ultrasound and we have a healthy 10 week old fetus. I finished the pack I had and haven't had another one yet. I am currently using the Nicorette Gum and it is ok but the work day is tough. I work at a car dealership and a lot of people smoke here. Reading your stories on here help though. Wish me luck!!

3 weeks cold turkey

It wasn't easy at first, but I quit cold turkey on February 24, 2018 and I intended to make this my final attempt, so that's been my goal. "Never take another puff". I have absolutely no desire to smoke again, and I understand that it only takes one puff to return to full relapse (for me personally at least). I wish the best for everyone else who is also on this journey, and for those of you who are wanting to quit, I encourage you to visit whyquit.com and educate yourself on the topic of cigarettes, nicotine, addiction, etc.

We can do this! Do your best to never take another puff of any form of nicotine, and if you manage to do so cold turkey, which I strongly recommend, consider how cold turkey is actually the most efficient method due to the fact that the nicotine is no longer being dosed and will more quickly deplete from your system than any other method of quitting, which means you can get through the dreadful withdrawal process much more quickly than you would if you attempted to wean yourself off. It seems to me that if you choose to wean yourself off, you're honestly just stretching the withdrawal process out, typically making things much more difficult for a longer period of time than necessary. Anyways, with that said, I once again encourage you all to check out whyquit.com, and best of wishes to you all.

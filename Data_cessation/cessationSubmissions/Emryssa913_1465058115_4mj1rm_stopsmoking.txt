18 days without nicotine and extremely tired

So I quit smoking 18 days ago. This app has definetly helped but I haven't read anything about anyone being extremely tired. Iv been out and about and drinking with friends and for some reason I keep experiencing this extreme tiredness.  I'm not a drug user but for some reason iv been nodding out. The only thing that has changed is that I no longer smoke cigarettes. does anyone else experience this and what can I do? I feel like I'm being a bore. before i quitting smoking I never had any problems staying up until the wee hours of the morning. Iv always been the life of the party. I'm sleeping more then normal because of this extreme tiredness but I have noticed that I haven't had a deep sleep in while.

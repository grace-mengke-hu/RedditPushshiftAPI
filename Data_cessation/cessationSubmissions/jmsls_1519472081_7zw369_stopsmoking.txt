Two weeks without voluntarily inhaling poison!

Hmm, that title makes me think I'm probably a bit like that annoying guy when you smoked. But it's true though, and whatever, as long as those thoughts keep me from smoking for the moment.

I don't know what I did this time which makes it different, but I think I just made the idea of smoking so unappealing in my head when I quit, really made myself feel the consequences it had and would have if I'd continue. Now when I think of smoking or even see a cigarette, I sometimes make a face like 'fuck, that's disgusting' or shudder a little. Yesterday a friend walked into a room after he smoked and for the first time I really smelled a smoker like non-smokers do, I don't need to say any more. Also, the smell just lingers around everywhere. 

Now for something more positive: I stopped smoking for two weeks! I'm buying myself an e-reader to celebrate. I've never made it this far, and to be honest I don't really tend to give myself the credits when deserved. But actually that's pretty good. I remember me mocking quitters or people who lived a healthy lifestyle: "It's not worth it.", "I don't have time for that." or "Everyone is different.", well up to now it has been worth it, I have more time and I have become a bit different. The upside of having a naturally pessimistic mindset is that you can prove yourself wrong. On to more healthy, smoke-free days!

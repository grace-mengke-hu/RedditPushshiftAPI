Who else thinks electronic cigarettes are actually bad?

The thing that scares me is that there is still no study about long term effects of using them. 
They are as addictive as cigarettes and I was lying to myself for almost 2 years that they are better than cigarettes. 
That panic feeling if the battery will last the whole day or if I have enough liquid is one thing. Another one is that I noticed I was smoking it ALL THE TIME. Normally I would smoke 15 normal cigarettes a day, but e- cig - I was constantly and unconsciously vaping !
It also cost me a lot of money, not mentioning how many times different parts were getting broken. 
I had a cough for months and couldn't sleep at nights. 
I think I would not advise it as a method to stop. It is more a method to delay the quitting date and a method to lie to ourselves.

What other harmful effects did you notice?

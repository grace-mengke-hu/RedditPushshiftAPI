A hundred days and my head is shrinking...

'm usually writing on here about how easy stopping is and how I've got all the cool methods to stop and that I don't even remember I'm a smoker anymore.....

I am drunk, tonight was really hard and these last few days have been really hard. I just think....that one cig. just one. just one.  I just know it won't be wrong. I know as soon as I spark up I know these last 100 days have been worthless. I don't want to do these 100 days again. But god damn it's fucking difficult now. p.s I live in China and everyone smokes inside. and everyone smokes......I don't know why I'm writing this..I guess I just want to share with people that know that this is fucking difficult. and know that you know how I feel right now. 

deep down inside I know I won't smoke again, I know I won't make that mistake. well, at least in the next month...after 130 days I would like to think the same thing. I just no..I am not going to smoke today no matttter how much I want to....tomorrow is always a different day. but I wish that the part of me that knows I will not smoke today willl tel the part of my brain that craves a cig to fuck off, cos it's just fucking annoying.

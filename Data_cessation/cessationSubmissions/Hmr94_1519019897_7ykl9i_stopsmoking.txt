6 week smoke/nic free check in. Are you still with me?

Just made it to week 6. I had a horrible week last week loosing my dog, I went away on the weekend (first trip without smoking) all loved up and happy and came down with a chest infection on Saturday.  But I’m doing it.  I just keep on trucking

What I wish I knew before I quit was that this journey would expose that I had a lot of serve anxiety and high functioning depression, that I’d fall apart at week 2 and need to be medicated and see a therapist who would make me realise I was so stressed out that I was making myself sick. 
I wish I knew that it would teach me to look after myself, not just physically but emotionally.
I wish I knew that quitting with your partner is a make it or break it situation, your going to hate him, cry with him, yell and be jealous over how easy it is for him to quit but be patient you’ll get through it. It’s made you guys sooooo much stronger (we’re on the other side of it now folks)   
I wish I knew that everyone else really doesn’t give a shit if you succeed or fail, they just want you to be happy, healthy and around well beyond 70.
I wish I knew that I can really do this.


What do you wish you knew?

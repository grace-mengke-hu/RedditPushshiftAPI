"Why keep going if you already tried it?"

This lady said this to me today. I was at a corner store/gas station where I usually buy single cigarettes instead of buying a whole pack. Everyday i'm in there, i greet her with a big smile and usually ask for 2 singles. 

When i came in today to buy some, she stopped ask "when did you strat smoking?"

I said "last year." 

then she said" why are you still smoking?" 

I said" at first when i started working at jobangles, when it got busy, i got stressed so one day, my coworker was outside smoking a cigarette and i being curious asked him for one and now I'm here"

she said" why keep going if you already tried it?"


She has got a point. I tried smoking cigarettes and its ok but why have I gotten this far still smoking. What's the point. What is 1 single benefit that you can get from smoking? I'm literally pouring my money into a habit that does not benefit you in any way. Its 2:14 am and I just got off work and the reason that made me want to write this is because, I seriously need to not give in to cravings and keep waisting money and harming my self slowly. This is definitely Day 1.

Caffeine and Nicotine

Didnt know if anyone knew this but i just found out and didnt see anything mentioned about on the page. 

essentially, nicotine metabolizes caffeine substantially more quickly, so when you stop the caffeine hits you harder. I have had some jitters, assumed it was withdrawal, think it is probably this.

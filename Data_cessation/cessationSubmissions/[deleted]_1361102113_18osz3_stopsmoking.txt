I'm feeling good about this attempt

I have been trying(and failing) to quit smoking for the past 4 months. Every damn day. It was really taking a toll on my self esteem and self belief. 

I don't know how it happened, but I quit 5 days ago, and I think that this time around it's for keeps. I even managed a night out with lots and lots of drinking. Feels good, man!

The one thing I've found that seems to work for me is really taking note of my cravings and what's causing them. Every time I'm craving a cigarette, I calm myself, and force myself to really think about why I want to smoke. I've even named them, lol.

"Oh, it's the bored-craving! This will pass."

"Oh, it's the worked-hard-want-a-reward-craving."

"This is the feeling-really-full-craving."

Anyway, it feels a lot better coming on this sub-reddit now that I'm not giving in anymore. Keep on keeping on, guys!

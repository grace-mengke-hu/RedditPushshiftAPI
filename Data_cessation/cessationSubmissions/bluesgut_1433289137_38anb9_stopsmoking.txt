Square one. No biggie.

So.. I made it, I don't know, 6 weeks out and cigs became completely foreign to me. I went to see a friend and said "Gimme one of those" -- It did nothing for me cognitively and i felt pretty sick and satisfied I had beat it. That turned into "just a weekend of smoking" which it was.. until a week later I was bumming cigs left and right and had to go purchase some of my own just so I didn't look so bad. Anyway, I got fed up and I'm back here on day one and just after 24 hours I'm already feeling this soreness in my throat gone. Here we go again (I should note that it's been a lot easier this time even though I've almost smoked several times).

Good luck, y'all.

Any real time messaging apps for us to make a support network?

While I think reddit is great for people wanting to make long posts/share links/have long and elaborate discussions, it doesn't really facilitate real time discussion, which can be important in the random situations like quitting smoking. Does anyone have any suggestions for some sort of cross-device mobile chat app we can set up so that we can directly contact one another when in crisis mode?

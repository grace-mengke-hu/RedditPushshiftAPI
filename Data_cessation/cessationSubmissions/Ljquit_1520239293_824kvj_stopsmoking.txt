It’s my cake day!

Which means it’s a year since my Smoke Free app told  me my mission was to go onto this sub and read the posts and maybe write one of my own. The best advice it could have given me. I lost count of the number of cravings I managed to get through by reading the posts here, and posting about my successes. This is a very supportive sub and I thank you all.

Day 8...

So I quit last Monday, making today my 8th day smoke free. I have managed ok so far, this is my first time going cold turkey. I used to smoke as many as 20 a day, and any time i attempted quitting i used patches or e cigs. I am glad to be 8 days without any form of nicotine, i think going cold turkey should surely make it easier in the long run. I still miss my morning cigarette with a cup of coffee though!!! I find managing cravings easier now than at the very start - I just tell myself "no, you dont smoke"..

Fingers crossed

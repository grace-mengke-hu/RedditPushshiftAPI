When will my emotions level out?

I teach teenagers, so I am already pushed to my limit almost daily, but I feel more easily aggravated, less patient, and more easily hurt by the things they do in class than normal. I feel tempted to take things more personally thanI know they actually are. I think I am hiding it decently well, but I am tired of dealing with it on the inside. 

I am also EXHAUSTED (I slept for 3 hours after work). I quit drinking 6 months ago too, so I think I am just having to learn how to deal with the stressors of my life without my vices. 

TL;DR: When will my emotions level out? I teach teens, but I feel like a teen myself right now.

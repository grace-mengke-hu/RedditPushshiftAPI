How did you guys establish new routines?

Day 2 starts today!

A lot of my smoking was tied to doing certain things. Like, wake up, heat up coffee, have a cigarette while I wait. On the way to work, have a smoke. That sort of thing.

My nicotine patches are working great at keeping the physical cravings away, but mentally, I still want them because that's what's part of that routine, if that makes sense. Mornings are really rough because that's when I smoked the most.

Does anyone have tips for adjusting to a new life as a nonsmoker?

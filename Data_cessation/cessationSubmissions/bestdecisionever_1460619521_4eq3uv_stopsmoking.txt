Day 2 complete

Survived the first 48 hours. No major cravings again, I do craved few times today, but not something I couldn't control. I didn't notice any major difference between today and [day 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/4ekjr6/day_1_complete/)

Looks like I have it under control. Quitting smoking is easy peasy, I just don't have to smoke again. And whenever the urges come, I have to distract my mind for few minutes.

Also, I was wondering earlier today, why my badge showed 1 day, but it seems it remembers the exact time when the badge was created. Thanks for reading.

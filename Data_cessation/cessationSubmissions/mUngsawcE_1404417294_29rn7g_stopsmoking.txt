Get over that hump for real

I made it a week now and i actually had to log in today to see how many days its been.  Ive had 1 slip on day 3.  Now on day 8.  But it feels good that im not even counting the days anymore.

Just came here to mention that the 1st 3 or 4 days seemed literally impossible.   But once u make it over that hump and start getting victories, they become as addictive as the cigarettes were.

I smoked 1.5 paxk a day goin on 12 years.  So i dunno i am really going through a growing phase at 30 to cope with this.  Dont want to get into that tho, just want to stress that if you can muster out a couple hard wins early on then they will snowball.

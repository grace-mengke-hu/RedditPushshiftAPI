Concerned about complications from quitting smoking? Stroke, heart attack etc.

I posted earlier asking for tips but didn’t receive much so I did a bit more looking and found articles that stated that quitting smoking can actually cause a heart attack or stroke in some people? Does anyone have any info on this? I don’t want to be scared into continuing to smoke! I’m already scared of continuing to smoke! Funny but sad and true.

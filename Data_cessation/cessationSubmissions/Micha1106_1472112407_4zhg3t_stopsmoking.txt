10 days now, had one day which was really hard.

On the last day of my vacation I smoked the last cigarette. That was 10 days ago. At the weekend I had a few beers, listening to good music, the urge for a cigarette was there really strong but I could resist. I have a half-full pack at home that I can not throw away.

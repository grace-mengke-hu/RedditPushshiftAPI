Here we go again

I’m new to the subreddit and I’ve been smoking on and off since I was 18. I’m 27 now and I’ve been wanting to quit for quite some time. 

I had my last cigarette on the 5th. I’ve found I will quit when I catch a cold and resume smoking when I’m feeling better. The most I went was a couple years and that was the first time I quit. I’ve quit a couple times since then with shorter windows of being a non smoker in between.

I hope this is the last time I have to quit.

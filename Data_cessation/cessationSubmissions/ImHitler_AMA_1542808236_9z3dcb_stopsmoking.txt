I don't have any proof to show that i quit smoking but last week was 370 days since I dropped one.

It's been 375 days that i quit smoking. Personally i haven't observed any change in my health. I don't have a partner so I don't know if my sex stamina has increased. I don't exercise a lot I mostly sit at my desk so I don't move a lot. My teeth never browned or yellowed. I smoked om average half pack a day for 4ish years.  The only great thing about quitting is the smell. The shitty shitty smell that stuck would otherwise stick my clothing and hands and all over. I slept and woke up in cigarette smell and that is the biggest  change. 


Yet I don't plan on changing this because I know cigarettes are unhealthy even if there aren't visible changes per se I'm ok with not having cancer

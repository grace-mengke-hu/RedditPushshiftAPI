Okay so day one...

Day one is here and wow was it difficult to break my morning routine of smoking. I always felt like my day was going to be ruined if I didn't start it off with a smoke. The main issue I am having right now is some severe brain fog. I'll try to focus on something at work but my train of thought always goes to cigarettes. It's like I can't think about anything other than smoking. I feel like I am in a strange dream world and that if I just had a cigarette everything would go back to normal. Anybody have any advice on how to function somewhat normally through these first couple days?

Nictotine gum makes me feel like I have a lump in my throat?

I tried quitting a couple days ago. Went to Costco and but a boatload of nicotine gum. The first time I chewed one, just felt a slight tingle. Hours later, I tried a second one. Almost immediately felt nauseous. Felt like a frog was in my throat and felt like I needed to puke. Tried a third hours later, same thing. These are the 2 mg gums. Package says that 4mg is recommended if you smoke within 30 minutes from waking up in the morning, I smoke within 5 minutes of waking up, and smoke a pack every 2 days on average (camel crush). Anyone know what might be going on? I really want to quit, have done so for years just by going cold turkey.

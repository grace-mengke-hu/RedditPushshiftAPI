Stopsmoking

So I quit smoking regular cigs cold turkey 20+ years ago. Tried a vape, just for fun , about 3 years ago and I was HOOKED! 

Have tried quitting vaping several times over the  past year... to no avail.

Any tips or advice from anyone who has quit vaping? I have tried to reduce nic amounts, but for me , I think cold turkey is the only option . Iâ€™m open to how anyone else out there has quit vaping though...

TIA!

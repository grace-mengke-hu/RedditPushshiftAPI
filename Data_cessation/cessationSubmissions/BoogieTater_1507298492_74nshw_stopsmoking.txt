Tomorrow is a month and I got good news

Tomorrow will be one month I've been smoke free and it has FLOWN by! Not only to do I feel and smell better, but the money saved is great AND not being a slave to... "let me smoke before we go" and "I'll smoke then do xzy" or "let me go outside in the rain and smoke". I have survived tropical storm Irma this month, having no power for days, and being around a toddler, and living with a smoker with sheer willpower of not lighting up! Woot woot! 

 So the exciting news my FIL has decided to quit smoking, which in return has made my husband want to quit too. So the 18th is set as their quit day and I am praying they stick with it! It would be awesome for my husband to quit too and join me in the smoke free life.  I know he is doubting himself hard though. He has been smoking a very long time. He is more worried about being at work, I was thinking of making him a kit of blowpops and gum to keep with him. 

Any advice of how to help him stick with it and encourage him? Should I suggest he do nicotine gum or patches first? Any others help their spouse quit after they have? 

Thanks all! I wouldn't be here without y'all!

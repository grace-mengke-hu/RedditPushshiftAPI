Is that feeling of self-worth better than any puff?

I've recently decided to quit again cold turkey after many failed attempts in the past. What I remembered from last time I did this was just how much I enjoyee being smoke free and that feeling and sense of self-worth from not doing it. I'm awaiting my badge on here and along with being 31 days free from gambling and now into my 4th day of being tobacco free, Im taking that sense of feeling healthy and liberated due to not smoking to inspire me to recover and pull my way free from debt. I will use this reddit group as inspiration during my battle.

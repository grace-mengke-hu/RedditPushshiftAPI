We'll ALL ALWAYS be smokers

But many of us will be making a choice not to smoke today and tomorrow. As time goes on, that choice will become easier to make, less of a choice and more of a desire.

Smoking does you no good. There is no upside or positive benefit from it. You do not look cool in the eyes of non-smokers and to smokers you're just an average Joe.

Nicotine and many of the other 5,000+ noxious chemicals in modern tobacco are highly addictive and, in sufficient doses, highly toxic. The nicotine addiction is the hardest to shake but once you realise that the strong nicotine craving only lasts for a minute or so and quickly fades then fighting the addiction becomes a breeze.

I was a smoker for 10 years and then an unsuccessfully non-smoker trying to give up for the next 10, until a month ago. This time it's for good. I want my life back before it's too late.

Good luck and big respect to all the smokers out there who choose to say no today and tomorrow, and keep on choosing life.

Scare yourself today. Get off the couch and to the gym or out for a run. Drink and eat well. Feel healthy. Change for the better.

Help! I want to stop smoking.

I want to stop smoking. I'm to the point where I'm smoking against my will. Being that I've gotten clean from heroin and don't use any mind altering or changing chemicals I would think that getting clean from smokes would be relatively easy but it's not. I liken going to the store to get smokes to copping dope. I don't want to do it anymore. 

I need help. I've been in recovery for sometime, go to meetings and work steps so I've got an inkling of what to do and a strong ass foundation but so far have not been able to stay abstinent. I've smoked for 20 years and am up to two packs a day. It's killing me.

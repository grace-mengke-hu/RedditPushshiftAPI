What gifts could I get for my girlfriend to encourage her decision to quit smoking?

This is probably her 4th time attempting to quit smoking. I understand it is a tough and trying time for her, I have been very supportive each time. Is there any type of gifts, from a smoker's perspective, that would be really encouraging in their decision to quit smoking?

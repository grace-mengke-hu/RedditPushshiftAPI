The thing that helped me most in quitting...

...was realising it was okay to have a 'trivial' reason for stopping, like not wanting to be wrinkly before my time or not stinking.

For way too long I thought I had to reach the point where I was terrified of developing lung cancer or heart disease for a successful quit. And although I knew those things are devastating and scary, I couldn't get motivated by something that seemed so abstract to me.

I don't know what changed, but I wanted to share: there is no reason too stupid or frivolous to quit! Whatever personally motivates you is valid regardless of what anyone else thinks.

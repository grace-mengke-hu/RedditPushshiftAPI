Tomorrow makes a year for me and I've been on the verge of tears all week...

It's like celebrating your escape from a captor... An exit from a bad relationship... I'm so happy, I am welling up while typing this. I've never been goal oriented. To accomplish a goal of such magnitude is, in itself, an accomplishment. Two in one if you will... Quitting smoking and accomplishing a difficult goal. The words fail me.

I am a sobbing 38 year old man.

EDIT: Thanks for the gold, /u/sstrdisco !

How long does this lightheadedness dizziness last?

This is part of the reason I always fail. I seem to get dizzy and feel a bit out of it whenever I stop smoking.

THe cravings I can deal with but feeling dizzy and a bit spaced out is really unpleasant for me.

Also when I cough I can taste smoke. I guess that's normal right ? My poor lungs, how I abused them.

Lastly my mood is so bad. I keep feeling over emotional, in particular anger and sort of depressed.

I hate smoking but I've never lasted more than a week with doing it.

Day 6 of quitting - Feel like shit?

So I'm on day 6 (yay) and I've only had one slip up cigarette. I've been drinking lots of water since I've heard that's good while you're quitting. I went from over a pack a day to cold turkey.

But I feel like shit. I can't sleep properly, I have nightmares and wake up multiple times throughout a night, making me tired all day. I woke up today with a slight cough and sore throat. My headache is back (it went away for the last few days) but that could be because I'm tired?

I feel like shit and I'm tired of having these creepy dreams. Please help! Do you have any tips for how to feel better or what to do to take care of yourself during quitting?

just checking in

Ok, I'm buried in work last few days, and the cold has passed, so I feel kind of funky (shivers on skin or something like that) on occasion, but it's passing. 

I feel great, and motivated to continue. 

Bonus 1. wife said that my breath is great now :) Bonus 2: wife also decided to quit, so we're keeping each other busy as best as we can :)

Be strong, dudettes and dudes, this too shall pass!

Quitting via directly switching to zero nicotine vape?

Hey everybody,

Previously, I have quit smoking for 5 months but then relapsed one night and gradually started full time smoking again. I want to quit again, but my biggest fears are the nights when I’ll be out drinking. In my previous attempt I was always irritated and couldn’t have fun from fighting against the urge to smoke all the time, and I don’t wanna repeat that. 

I am thinking of using a zero nicotine vape as a replacement to keep myself occupied on my night outs. Is this a reasonable way of fighting against it? Is there anyone here who has accomplished quitting this way?

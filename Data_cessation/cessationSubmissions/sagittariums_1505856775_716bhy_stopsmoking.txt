Work is Driving Me Nuts

I used to light a cigarette as soon as I was off of my company's grounds. I've been okay the last few days without my walk home smoke, but today was a busy day with a lot of extra stress and not smoking is proving to be really hard right now. I told myself that if I saw someone smoking on the street I'd ask to bum one, but I'm almost home now and haven't seen anyone. I'm happy I didn't because I would have asked and I would have been so disappointed in myself, but I hate that I was so close to giving up like that. 

Sorry for the rant, I just don't feel strong today and you all inspire me so much.

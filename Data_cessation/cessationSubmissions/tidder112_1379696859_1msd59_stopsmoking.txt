4 Months Down, and I am feeling fine.

The habit is no longer there, but I walk through crowds of smoke clouds in front of my school, and see tobacco filled butts on the ground, and it still brings up my struggle to mind.

I know I wont let myself break the promise I made to myself, but I still have thoughts, and I still see people smoking and want one.  Not for any reason except familiarity and maybe a little head buzz.

I have to be careful, and I have to learn to ignore that part of my brain that says, "hey, guess what I know is going on around here, why not partake?"

Let's hope next month I will have forgotten to check my phone and notice another 30 days have passed.

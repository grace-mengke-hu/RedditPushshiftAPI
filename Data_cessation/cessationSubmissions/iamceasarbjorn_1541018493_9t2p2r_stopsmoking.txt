How Psychadelic Mushrooms Ended My Nicotine Addiction

I became desperate to quit my habit of chewing tobacco and my search led me to trying Psychadelic mushrooms. The first time I took them I threw up but only from a full stomach (technically it is a poison) and my body reacted to it.   
However,  I was the happiest Ive been in a long time. It was a great experience, so great, in fact, that I took some more 2 days later, then 3 days later. (This time on an empty stomach) And what I had noticed the following days of taking the mushrooms was that I no longer had a craving for chewing tobacco or nicotine. Its like the desire has all but went away. I still think about doing it at times but more so just habitually. It stopped the chemical desire for it however, which is a fantastic miracle.  
It was as if my mind was at peace and I no longer thought all day long about my inherent need to chew. To this day I am a month clean from my addiction thanks to psychadelic mushrooms.  


Anyone trying to quit smoking or chew or any bad habit for that matter, I highly recommend doing a few days dosage of mushrooms.

One month! I still can't believe it.

I have to remind myself that I used to smoke now. It's so weird how that happens! 

I'll see someone smoking and instead of thinking "I wish I could have one", I think about how weird it is that I used to do that and how unnatural it looks. So glad my time isn't wasted on smoking now. Things I thought were impossible (like staying in my office for the majority of the day) are basically nothing now and I find it hilarious how difficult my addiction made everything seem. 

Also I used to have low-level anxiety throughout certain days. That's completely gone now since I quit and I can definitely associate it with smoking. PLUS hangovers now are a piece of cake in comparison to when I smoked!

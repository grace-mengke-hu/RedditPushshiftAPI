Help me fight relapse

I'm ~50 days without tobacco.  Before that it had been ~50 days, so I think I'm past the physical symptoms.  But now, I'm starting to wish I had it back.  I find myself getting addicted to a bunch of other things, and I hate it, because I'm not focusing on my school work like I used to.  I'm not sure if it's other things in my life which are causing me to feel this way, but I just think to myself that if I started smoking again, I could forget about all this other shit, and be productive again.  Advice?

Want to share some benefits I experienced as a woman after quitting for 5 days and counting

I have smoked for 6 years with half pack a day since I was 20. Quit a few times, but I feel this time is the real deal. I actually really hated smoking.

- My skin is less oily and more radiant 
- The skin on my legs and hands is more moisturized 
- My lips are no longer purple because of the slow blood circulation
- I don't wake up with a smelly mouth 
- My lips are softer
- No disgusting taste in my mouth
- My hands used to have the mix smell of smoke and perfume. It's the most nauseating smell in the world. Kinda smells like an old cab. Now my hands smell amazing. 
- I can breath much better. No more morning cough
- My body is less tensed up and I have better posture
- My hair is no longer greasy after a day

These just are results of quitting for a few days. I can't wait for it to become much better.

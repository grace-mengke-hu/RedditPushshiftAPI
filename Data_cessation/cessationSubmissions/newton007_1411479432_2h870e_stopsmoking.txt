A rough start

I asked a question earlier but thought how rude that I didn't say hello first. So hi. Never used this community but someone put me on it and you all seem amazing! Hoping it helps to connect with people going through the same thing. 
I've had a rough start. I am determined. I'm ready to quit. And it's my first time trying. 
Well it began a few days ago - lasted 12 hours. Failed. 
Got up the next morning - new slate. Lasted 20 hours - caved. 
How do I begin to do this??? I'm all good to go and not even a day into it - I'm throwing the towel in. Just had another "last one" - going to bed. And will try again tomorrow. 
Any helpful words would be amazing in how to keep going....

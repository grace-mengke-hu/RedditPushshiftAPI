Two Hours In

Last night, I (28 F) thought a lot about quitting. This morning, the thought lingered but I ignored it and smoked anyway. Around 3 p.m. EST, I found out that my uncle was diagnosed with aggressive lung cancer and given a maximum life expectancy of two years. I smoked my last cigarette around 3:10 p.m. EST.

Since I still have nicotine in my system, it hasn't been so bad... yet. Let's see what the next few hours have in store.

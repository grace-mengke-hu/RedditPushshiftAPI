No real difference

With the stress of work, it still feels exactly like when I smoked. I have the same fuzzle-head and craving for a ciggie that I had if I hadn't smoked for a while during the day. When I smoked I would take regular smoke breaks just to get away from my office, but now I don't smoke, I don't  remember to take a break, so I'm working non-stop for hours, and then get the cravings.  Then I get home and crave sugar like a maniac. Life's a bitch.....

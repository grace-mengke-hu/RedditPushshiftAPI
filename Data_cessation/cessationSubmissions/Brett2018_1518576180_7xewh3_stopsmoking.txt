I know it is time.

I'm 27 years old. I have been a smoker for 13 years now, at least a pack a day for the past 10. I recently was laid off from my job of almost 3 years and fortunately find myself in a new one.

Nobody here smokes and my bank has been absolutely destroyed. I have been worrying daily if my truck will be repo'd or if the power will be shut off and I have 3 more weeks until I get my first check.


----- Now is the time I need to quit smoking. -----------

 I have a box of nicoderm CQ step1 patches from a year+ ago.
IS this the right way to go? Last time I tried the patch I quit completely within 2 months and stayed good for almost a year. 

Black &amp; milds occasionally are no better than smoking again. Lesson learned.


My question for the reddits. 

Finish my pack? It was really hard for me to spend the money on this and I have 6 cigarettes left. 

Use the patch? or cold turkey?  My girlfriend whom i live with smokes, and we smoke inside the house (no kids dont worry). Is cold turkey possible? Or should I break my habitual habit first?

Any help is appreciated.

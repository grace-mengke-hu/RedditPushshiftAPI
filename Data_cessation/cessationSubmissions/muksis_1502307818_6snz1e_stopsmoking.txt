Day 6, feeling OK(ish)

Hello! 

I've smoked since I was 13 (now 35) so 22 years and ~a pack/day. 

My previous quit was for about 6 months (5.5 years ago). I was starting at a new job back then and it was stressful (shocker) so I relapsed and immediately got back to my old ways. Been telling myself I'm "too stressed" or "too busy" or just "have too many things going on" to quit again since then. Excuses, excuses. 

This time I feel very motivated and better prepared, too. I really want to keep this promise to myself and be done with this useless habit. I've been taking 3-6 pcs of nicotine gum/day now and it helps me. 

Reading the posts & comments here is very helpful so thank you! I wish you all the very best with your quit.

What's one thing you didn't expect to enjoy so much about not smoking?

I have become so obsessed with my smile. I can see the yellow going away and my mouth feels so much cleaner all the time instead of only after brushing.

I've never been overly concerned about my teeth. I've always brushed twice a day, but kinda rushed it and wasn't super consistent with flossing or mouthwash.

But since quitting it's become a ritual I love, and I really didn't expect that. Just taking my time and doing each step and enjoying it. I keep smiling at myself in mirrors and feel so much more confident talking to people and knowing my breath doesn't smell like butt xDD. I finally broke down tonight and bought a waterpik because I just couldn't resist anymore. My teeth feel so clean!! 

So what's your unexpected pleasure?

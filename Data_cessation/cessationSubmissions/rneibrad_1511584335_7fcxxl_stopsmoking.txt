Quit day

Sorry for two posts in one day. 
Buuuut. After smoking my entire shift at work (6-7 cigarettes), I gave my pack away and decided that I am not smoking again after today. Tomorrow would have been three weeks if I wouldn't have bought a pack this afternoon. And I'm determined that it is NOT going to happen again. 
Thank you everybody for the support. I really appreciate it

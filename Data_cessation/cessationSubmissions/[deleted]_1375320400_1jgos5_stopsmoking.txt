Time to quit (again)

I stopped smoking on January 22 and fell off the wagon in the beginning of May.  I stopped again for 10 days towards the end of June, but have been smoking pretty aggressively for the entire month of July.

Over the weekend I stopped seeing the chick I was seeing (who was a bad influence as far as healthy behavior is concerned... we had a lot of fun, but we partied way too hard), and have been detoxing since Monday.  Today is day 3 into no drinking or drugs, and I'm almost 24 hours without a cigarette.

Monday I smoked five.  Yesterday I smoked two.  Today I'm going back and forth between feeling angry and self-loathing.  Feels like a cigarette would help, but I know that's not the case.

Maybe I should've waited to completely detox before I stopped smoking too?  I woke up today wanting to go and do a bunch of productive things since I was off work, but crawled back into bed after breakfast, just to have more fever dreams for half the day.

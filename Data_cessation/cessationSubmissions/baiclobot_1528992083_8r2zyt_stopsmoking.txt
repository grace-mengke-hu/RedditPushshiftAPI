Smoking mom and I absolutely hate myself. I’m ready to quit. I can do this.

As a way to just keep myself accountable I want to share my reasons for quitting. Just as something to look back on. I’ve set my quit date for Monday. I didn’t want to ruin my husbands first Father’s Day with my bitchy non smoking self. But anyways here are my top 5 reasons to quit.

1. I will save an astronomical amount of money. 
2. The 15 minutes I waste smoking will be time I get to play with my kiddo.
3. I will be a non smoker for as long as my kid will remember and that can only be a positive, good example for him to follow. 
4. My smoking is gambling with not only my health but his. Despite all of the ridiculous measures I have in place to lessen the second hand exposure (hand washing, even changing clothes, etc) it’s still a gamble. 
5. I have quit for years at a time before. It’s easier than it seems and I know without a shadow of a doubt how much better I will feel as a non smoker. 

I’ve got this.
I’ve got this.
I’ve got this.

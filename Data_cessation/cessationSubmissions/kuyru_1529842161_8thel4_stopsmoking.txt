nth attempt

I have lost track of the number of times I've tried to quit, but hopefully this is it. 

Been smoking for 10 years and in the recent years I have developed an incessant cough which is followed by some phlegm, few times with blood. I also wake up every morning with aches, if I wake up earlier than usual this is considerably worse.

I hope to make it this time and decided to join the community for support. I wish all others patience as well.

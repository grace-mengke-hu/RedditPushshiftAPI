A couple of hours in, today is truly Day 1!

I smoked for about a decade. Last night I finished EASYWAY and just decided I was sick of it, put out that last cigarette halfway through, and instantly became a non-smoker. 

Fast forward to this morning, I've had one craving but just reminded myself if I feed it, it will just continue.

Otherwise, I feel awesome!! I will keep updating this thread.

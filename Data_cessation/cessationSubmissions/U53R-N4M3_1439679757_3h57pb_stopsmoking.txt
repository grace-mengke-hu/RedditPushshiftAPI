Allen Carr's The Easy Way to Stop Smoking. Almost 600 days later, I have zero clue as to how I stopped smoking, but I no longer do.

It is completely bizarre. It is like he mentally flipped some switches in my mind and turned off all incentive to smoke.   I am currently reading The Easy Way to Control Drinking and his book is a complete mind-fuck.  My mind is so confused midway through but I am pretty certain it will work.

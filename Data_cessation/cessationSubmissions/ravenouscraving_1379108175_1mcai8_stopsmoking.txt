Badge reset, shame, and resolve

Resetting my badge today. I was smoking with my father over the weekend.

A little back story, my father and I have had a rocky relationship. I hadn't spoken to him in YEARS. So I was at his place for the weekend getting reacquainted and decided I wanted to have some smokes with my drinks.

I came back from his place and was fine. I'm fine not smoking. I don't get serious cravings, even after that relapse. I just, for some reason, got it in my head that I liked to smoke when I'm drinking heavily.

And now today, I'm on the phone with customers all day and my voice is AWFUL. I'm coughing, and I'm spitting up that familiar, nasty gunk that we're all familiar with.

I tossed the rest of my rolling tobacco in the trash. 9 months down the drain.

Never again. Don't make my mistake. You will regret it.

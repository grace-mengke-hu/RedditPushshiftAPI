Just a thank you and appreciation.

I only hit the cigarettes hard for about a year after a hard break-up. I wished it had been weed since it'd be healthier by comparison and cheaper, but I was too stuck in my head to find a friend to buy from. 

Once I started talking and spending time with my friends again I felt happier and wanting to smoke less, so most of my addiction was psychological instead of physical.

While I guess I didn't need /r/stopsmoking as much others, I wanted you all to know that your inspirational messages and community (even though I mainly lurked) helped me with my depression.

Thank you.

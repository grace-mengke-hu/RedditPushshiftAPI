6 months cig and nic free and things haven't been going well..

i have bipolar disorder and spend a lot of my energy trying not to self destruct. lately my best friend (one of my only friends) is moving across the country, got ditched by an old gf to meetup while she was in town, im unemployed, and current girl has ignored me w/o responding all week and i don't know why. today is my 6 month marker and i am trying not to buy a pack and drink all day. Yeah the depression is coming back and exercise and meds aren;t enough. sorry for the bitching i just don;t know what to do

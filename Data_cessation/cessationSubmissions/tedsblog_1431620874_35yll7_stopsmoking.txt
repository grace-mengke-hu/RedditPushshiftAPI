Yesterday marked four years tobacco free

Four years ago yesterday, May 13th, I had my last cigarette. It was tough, I'd smoked nearly a pack a day for over 20 years, but thanks in no small way to this group I got through the very difficult first few days/weeks/months. It gets easier you guys just starting out, just know that you are stronger than a paper tube filled with weeds. And cancer. Don't forget the cancer.

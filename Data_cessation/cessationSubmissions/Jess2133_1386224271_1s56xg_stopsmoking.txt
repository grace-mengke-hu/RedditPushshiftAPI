Today I decided I need to quit.

So, I decided I need to quit, I've been smoking for a bit over 8 years, and to be totally honest, I'm scared. 

I've thought about it, and I think cutting down would be better than cold turkey, but so far ( 10 hours in) I've already broken my rule twice. 

I don't have any idea on what to do, I'm anxious, I can't focus on anything and I've cried more times then I would like to admit. 

I need help, advice, ideas, anything to help me feel better about this. 

I'm trying to cut down from every hour, to every 2 hours, and tomorrow trying every 3 hours, but I don't feel like it will work if I can't get around this 'useless' feeling. 

How has everybody else done it?

Day 4 - I’ve had shit news and all I want to do...

I’m on day 4. I had loads of tests at the hospital a couple of weeks ago to try and diagnose a stomach problem, today I found out they were all clear. I know, I know, that should be good news. But it’s not, I’m in pain every day and I don’t know why and I’m no closer to getting it sorted.

Since I got the news, I’ve been going from sad, to angry and back again. I also just want to go pick up a pack of my old friends. I know they won’t help, but I want them.

7 days

It's been 7 days that I stopped poisoning myself.  I can't say it's been hard in fact I  feel pretty much in control this time.  Whenever I have what I would like to think of as a distorted thought about smoking again I start reminding myself of my reasons to quit that I wrote down the day I smoked my last one.  My favourite and most powerful idea is that every smoker will have to stop smoking one day there's no way around it, so why not stop before you have to deal with one of the consequences that this addiction will surely bring.

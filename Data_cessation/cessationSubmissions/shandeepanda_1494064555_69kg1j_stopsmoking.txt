Smoked after 10 days. Feel terrible

So week 1 was so easy for me, I was surprised. Now suddenly as week 2 began it's been hell. I wish I knew how long it would be until I start to feel good again.
But anyway. Cracked and bought a pack last night, had 4 or 5 cigarettes. I feel awful about it especially since week 1 I was so strong and I'm supposed to be over the worst of it by now.
I'm starting to feel hopeless because I've tried to quit so many times and always fail. 
I don't want to start again and I'm going to get back on the horse but I feel like I can't trust myself. Any advice?

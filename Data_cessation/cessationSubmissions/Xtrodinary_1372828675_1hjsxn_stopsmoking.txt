Trying to stop again and kind of messed up tonight.

Not a throwaway because fuck that. 

I've only been smoking for around four years. I quit for around three months then picked it up again in January around my birthday. On 11:45 June 30th I smoked my last cigarette, or at least I hoped. Well, tonight I smoked half a black and mild. I think that being apart of this community will help me. Before, I quit cold turkey but this time it seems harder. I'm working more and I know this isn't an excuse but working in a kitchen a lot of the people around me smoke. I failed tonight but I will keep trying. Sorry if this seems clich√© but I think that putting myself out there and join people with similar interests can help me thought the coming month and beyond.

Going to Thailand for a month in a few days

So I'm 42 days smoke free now. Thats awesome. It truly is. I can go to bars and nightclubs again without much cravings. Alcohol was the biggest trigger for me, so I really enjoy this.

A problem is coming up, though. In a few days I will leave for Thailand, and will stay there for a month. Backpacking through the country. Since my biggest motivation to stop is financially based, it will be really hard for me in Thailand, because a pack is only around 2 euros. I keep telling myself that I will not smoke while I'm there, but somehow I feel that my mind already made the decision, and I'm allowed to smoke for a month. I read all the posts here from people who also got tricked by "I just smoke one cigarette" and relapsed into their old habit, but still I feel my mind somehow already made the decision to start smoking when I'm there. I keep telling myself I won't, but it really scares me.

How do I get my act together and not smoke? Anyone been in this situation?

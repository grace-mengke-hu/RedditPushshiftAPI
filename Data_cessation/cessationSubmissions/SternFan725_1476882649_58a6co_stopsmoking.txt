Day 7 To Patch or Not to Patch

I have been a CHRONIC relapser with this just as I was when I was recovering from a couple other substances. I was finally just sick and tired of being sick and tired. I took a pragmatic route of patches and mint toothpicks for the oral fixation and then got spiritual with removing the desire to smoke.

I also have been reading Allen Carr. I have patches left, but I'm quite frankly really excited to just expel this nicotine from my body and HEAL. I may be getting ahead of myself by doing this, however I may just be prolonging my misery 12 hours on the patch/12 hours off.

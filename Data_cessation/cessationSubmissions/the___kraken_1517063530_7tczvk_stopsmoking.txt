Should I see a therapist before I try to quit?

This past year I really started to overcome my depression and anxiety, something that I’ve been battling close to a decade.  I did it without support or meds.  Got a new job, fixed myself up by losing 80 lbs, met a new girl and life has been pretty good.

Yesterday I had to get a tooth extracted.  They said wait 24 hours before you smoke.  I haven’t even made it 24 hours and I’m ready to risk my health even further, dry socket be damned, to have a cig.  I feel like 10 years of struggles, small steps, and progress are about to be completely undone if I don’t have a smoke.  I feel like my world is collapsing.  I’m a teacher - I can already see myself behaving unprofessionally and snapping on a colleague or student and losing my job.  I can feel the sadness and isolation coming back.  I can’t even get to the point of deep breaths because when I think I’ll never have another cig again my breaths go shallow and I feel like breaking something and then crying.  I feel like the almost endless support I get from from my beautiful, loving girlfriend is going to wear thin because I can already feel myself regressing.  

This seems impossible - and everything in me is telling me not to quit because if I do, I’ll be back where I started.  Jobless, alone, miserable.

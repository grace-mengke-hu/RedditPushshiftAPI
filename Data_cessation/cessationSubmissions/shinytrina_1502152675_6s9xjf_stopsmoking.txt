I think my mind is playing games with me and I could use some help

I keep on smelling smoke even though smoking is not allowed in the hallways here and none of my neighbours smoke that I know of, yet for some reason I keep on smelling it and it is making me crave so badly right now.  I really really really don't want to break yet I am so worried that I will.

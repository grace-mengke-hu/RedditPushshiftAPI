Quitting a different addiction helps with the first. Is this a strategy?

Eight months ago I quit drinking. Managed it quite well, but it got easier when I quit smoking two months ago. I tended to focus on the trials of quitting smoking, so I forgot about alcohol. A few days ago I went on a diet. Now I tend to obsess about food, and forget about cigarettes. 

Is this a strategy?

Is anyone here using Chantix?

I used it a couple of years ago and was able to stop smoking for about 6 weeks before falling off the wagon. I was hoping for similar success (and of course hoping to quit for good) this time around but after 10 days I still haven't been able to put the cigarettes down. I was wondering if anyone was going through anything similar or have any pointers.

I need help, but I’m not sure what kind.

I need to quit smoking, and on days like today I even want to quit. I caught a cold last Thursday that quickly turned into a respiratory funk (like it always does thanks to smoking). I stayed awake half the night in a coughing fit because the congestion is thick and doesn’t want to come out. I got pneumonia last year due to this. 

I know I need to quit. I’ve read both Easy Way and Only Way by Allen Carr. Everything they said made perfect sense. I know I’m being lied to. I know it’s killing me. I know the enjoyment is false, but I can never make it past a day or two. It’s like my rational brain can’t compete with the rest of it. It doesn’t help that my husband is a smoker too. I see him outside smoking and remember how that was our time to watch funny videos or vent to each other about our day. I’m also aware this is just another excuse. I could just as easily do those things with him inside or outside without lighting up. 

I don’t want you to think my husband’s not supportive. He does everything he can to help me in my attempts. He’s hidden them from me, won’t smoke near me, etc. Everything I’ve asked and more.  I feel like I’ve tried everything and what it boils down to is the desire, false or not, starts screaming in my head. The break from work/chores, the “kill 5 min of boredom”, the intermission that separates the various tasks in my day. I just want to smoke and it makes me feel like a spoiled child that I should get what I want strictly because I want it. This person isn’t me. I don’t act like this about anything else. 

I need to quit and today, I even want to, but it never lasts beyond “today”. Does anyone who’s been there have any advice or tips that might help? I just want to not want it anymore. 

Thank you for listening to my rant.

20/01/2019, day #18

How are you all doing today? I'm at work, on a break, and thought of posting again. In a few hours I'll reach 18 days smoke free!  

It's weird. Friday was a day with an extreme craving, yet Saturday was a day with none, just like today, so far. I didn't even think about posting here yesterday.  
Anyway, I'm almost at my three week mark, only a few more days. Can't wait. Another milestone. Every day that comes and goes is another day of fresh air. More distance between me and my last cigarette.  

So, last time I asked you what changes you were most surprised by, since you quit smoking. Right now I'm curious to know: what is something you thought was going to be difficult to do, without cigarettes, but turned out okay.  

Keep up the good work. I will not smoke with you today.

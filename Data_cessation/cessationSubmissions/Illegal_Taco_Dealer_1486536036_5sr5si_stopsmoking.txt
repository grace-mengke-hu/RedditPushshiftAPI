Coming to terms.

It's really the uncertainty of things that get to me. I feel like my closest friends have it all figured out and that I'm in the blind. I could compare it to being on a racetrack and when the starter pistol goes off, everyone is darting towards the finish line and I'm stuck on a treadmill. It's as if I'm running, but I'm not going anywhere. I'm making the efforts, but I feel no payoff. I believe Nicotine has done that to me. I started smoking when I was in my sophomore year of high school and I haven't dropped it since. I'm still young, only a 19 year old sophomore in college, but I really need to make this change and I'm going to start it today. I'm not afraid anymore. I know my personality will change and I'll be different, but it will be for the better. I just have to remember those simple, honest, and treasurable words: 
"It's for the best."
I have to have hope that everything will fall into place, everything will have its answer and it's resolve. I want this clarity and I want to have the power over my life that I see so many of my friends have who do not smoke or use nicotine as an aid.
So I'm making my change today. Thank you for showing me that I am more important, and more valuable, than this addiction ever could make me. 
r/stopsmoking you are the absolute best.

Let's Talk Caffeine

Caffeine is my lifeblood.  I'm garbage without it.  I need it to get what I need to get done, done, as far as work is concerned.

I do know however, through previous failed quit attempts that excessive caffeine really exacerbates the cravings, even a ways down the road.  

And I also know that I can't be the only one like this.  How have you quitters adapted  and survived to this issue?

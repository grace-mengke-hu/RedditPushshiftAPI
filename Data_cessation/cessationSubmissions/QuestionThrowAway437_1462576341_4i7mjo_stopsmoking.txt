I was a smoker for ~3 years, but I have now quit. What are my risks?

Hi, I'm looking for information about risks of smoking given that a person has been a smoker for a given time duration. 

I started smoking after graduating college, and had the same routine for about 3 years. I never considered myself a heavy smoker, but I think that's the main reason I never considered it a serious problem. 

Every day after work I would smoke a 1-3 cigarettes. I generally followed the same pattern on weekends. I officially quit 4 months ago, and I seem to be over the addiction. I'm confident that I'm never going to smoke another one. 

I was curious if the risks of smoking were different for someone who was smoking for 1 year vs 3 years vs 10 years, and if so then how different?

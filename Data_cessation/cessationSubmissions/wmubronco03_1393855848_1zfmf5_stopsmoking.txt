16 days smoke free using Allen Carr's book and a hypnotherapy app by Max Kirsten.

I decided to double down and combine the two. Never tried hypnotherapy but Allen Carr mentions it in his book. I did some googling and found out about Max Kirsten. He helped Ewan Mcgregor quit. The app is only like $7, so even of it is only a placebo it seemed to act like a touchstone that first week.  There is a 40 minute starting session, which you only listen to once, then there is a 20 minute booster you listen to everyday for a week and then every other day for 3 weeks. Might be an odd thing to do but so far so good. I made sure to drink often that first week so as to break the association between  drinking and smoking. Keep up the good work!

6 Months

Wow. I can't believe I've actually done it. Half a year, and in a lot of ways it went by in a blink. Only very rarely do I get cravings, and when I do I'm very well practiced in saying "no" by now! I can breathe better, smell better, taste better. Physical exercise isn't as taxing. I'm not attached to a cigarette and don't experience anywhere near as much stress or anxiety anymore.

I genuinely wasn't sure if I'd ever be able to quit. I had tried a few times before, making it about 24 hours (or on an occasion or two for 49-72 hours) but I always ended up breaking down. It would feel like I was going completely insane. I couldn't think through the fog of not having a smoke, and my moods were wild. But I stuck with it. 

And now? Freedom. Sweet, sweet, freedom from cigarettes. 

If you're currently reading this and contemplating quitting, do it, now! You owe it to yourself. This is your life and you deserve better.

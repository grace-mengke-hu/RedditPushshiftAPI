I relapsed, but I'm 3 days without a smoke

I got tempted and relapsed... chain smoked half a pack that I found at home. I'm finding it hard to quit since I'm anxious about some troubles at work but exercising is helping a lot!

I can say, even with that relapse, I'm feeling somewhat better (breathing and energy)

So far, 3 days without smoking! :-D

I was reading this subreddit, and I have decided to quit smoking like that

However, this craving is coming intense as we type. I feel like having just *one* more smoke you know?

I have been a pack a day smoker for 9 years since I was 14. I started out with a cigar, and then to fit in with my friends in high school. After that it was an unhealthy addiction that would have me sneak into my mothers room in the middle of the night to take her debit card and buy two packs of smokes for myself and steal her smokes all the time. I would scrounge for cigarettes like a dirty hobo.

One image I have is several years ago when my good friend came over to where I used to hang out to buy coke. He wasn't allowed inside so my pseudo-friend sold him a gram and he went outside and spilled it on the ground (don't ask :P) He then went on his hands and knees on the pavement and snorted that rock with god knows what else was on that ground. Well, that is how I feel with cigarettes. I go to the gym but feel I am not hitting my full potential. I can barely run a full mile without multiple breaks and try to tell myself that I have no stamina. I want to taste my food because I love cooking but I feel I overseason everything all the time. I want to wash my clothes once and have that sweet smell linger for more then my next cigarette.

Oh to be able to have whiter teeth and cologne that stays with me. Fuck this is going to be hard. 

I have quit before using champix. Twas this time last year and I just wished to quit but didn't have the willpower. After two days I just stopped and was disgusted by smoking. I didn't smoke for a full year afterwards and felt great. I lost 70lbs, had my first visible six pack, and my girlfriend from Sweden visited me. Life was absolutely grand. Then she left and I started doing pub nights with my friends, and one particularly drunk evening I went outside to talk to my friend and had half a menthol. The taste was disgusting but the high intoxicating. I went home afterwards and bought primetimes, and smoked them regularly in the morning on my drive to work. Of course it escalated into buying a pack a mere month later. and for several months now, I have spirited money away into a useless addiction.

I have used the rockiness of my relationship lately as an excuse for smoking because I feel stress. I know that is bullshit. I also use the regularity of my breaks at work for cigarettes and say that is extremely difficult to break. Also bullshit. I have quit before and I know I can do it again. But I am scared, of the withdrawals, of my best friend who is a hardcore smoker, and just the intense cravings.

I apologize, I have rambled. But I feel like I should have said something and I did. Feels good bro. 

**TL;DR** Story of my smoking life. and how just reading some shit here has made me decide to quit right now. Right after this last one...

**Edit** I am 23, I was smoking since I was 14

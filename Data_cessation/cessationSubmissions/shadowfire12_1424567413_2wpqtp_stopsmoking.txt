I Started Smoking to Understand Addiction

The closest people in my life have suffered and, more frequently than not, succumbed to addiction. Alcoholism, eating disorders, hard drugs, the sorts of substances that swap your blood with anti-freeze and set you on a linear path from fix to fix. It came to a spearhead when the woman I loved and my best friend simultaneously came forth that they were in need of professional help dealing with crippling addiction. Obviously I urged them towards rehabilitation. I attended open meetings and I sat in private council till stupid o'clock more days of the week than not. I could see their pain, but I couldn't understand it. I would repeat things like "It'll only get easier, I promise. Be strong, I know you can", things I had heard from counselors and sponsors alike. I could see the disconnect; they looked through my words, saw the token gestures, felt the lack of true empathy. I decided that sympathy would only take me so far, and that I intended to go much further. I started smoking. It was an active decision to experience addiction in a relatively safe environment in order to better support those I love and understand those I've lost. Two years later, too many packs later, I've quit. This is my third week sans nicotine. Tobacco was hard. I wanted to understand what they went through, I thought it would help. I hurt so much more for them now. Addiction is a blight, and I am proud of everyone here for their commitment to its eradication. So be strong, I now truly know you can.

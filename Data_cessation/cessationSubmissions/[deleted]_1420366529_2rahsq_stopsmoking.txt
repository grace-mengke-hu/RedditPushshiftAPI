Is smoking a joke?

Goddamn are we serious, smokers how do we continue this lie, I mean for fucks sake I'm 23 years old, and probably have tried to quit over 50 times in the past 7 years. I have gone months of times with no nicotine, and still come back to the same old tasty savior(demon) that is supposed to make my life happy or as it usually does, complacent. It's fucking crazy. I wasn't happy before I started, dipping, smoking, or addicted to nicotine,and being addicted has made my life way worse. Fuck, this shit is addicting. When you see loved ones dying, smoking cigarettes, it really shows the true nature of addiction. When you see a friend battling hogdkins lymphoma smoking a cigarette do you stop him, no, of course not, I fucken didn't, I smoked one with him( I hate myself way worse for other things.) I am sure he will make it through ( kid's a champ), but who in there in their right minds would smoke going through chemotherapy( addicts will.)  I mean c'mon. I didn't know where else to post this, and encourage everyone else who smokes to quit, or let the addiction destroy your life.

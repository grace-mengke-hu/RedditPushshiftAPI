The grass really is greener on the other side

Today's is my one year anniversary. One whole YEAR. ðŸ™Œ You guys were my greatest support in the beginning and what helped me the most. I now chew a pack of gum a day and eventually would like to get over the mouth movement addiction but hey I'll take him over smokes any day. After the first month or so I stopped obsessing over cigarettes. Soon after that the smell of them turned my stomach and no longer smelled unbelievably good to me. I still have cravings sometimes but they are months apart and more of a nuisance than anything. My brain says "oh a smoke would be nice" and almost as soon as that thought is over I'm like eww gross cigarettes are nasty.  Sorry this is so long and drawn out but life really is better on the other side. I see people paying for a pack with change and am so grateful that is no longer me. My change is for vacuuming my car now ðŸ˜‚ Moral of the story guys keep at it it's worth so much.

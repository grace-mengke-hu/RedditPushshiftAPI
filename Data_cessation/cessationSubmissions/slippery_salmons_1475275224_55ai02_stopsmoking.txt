I'm tired of quitting over and over.

Within the last year and a half I've "quit" six times. Sometimes for a month, one time for three months. Then, I always start again. When I go to quit the next time "for real", I get so mad at myself for having to go through the initial quitting urges all over again. Today is day one of attempt number too many. I notice that with every time I quit I feel more like this is the time for good. I'm not sure if I'm just not doing something right, or what my problem is. I'm tired of smoking. I really am. Never posted here, just venting some thoughts.   

Thanks for all the support everyone. It's a process, and I know I can get through it.

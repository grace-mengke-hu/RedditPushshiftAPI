So I just passed 48 hours...

And I feel alright, I have quit for months before with the use of an e-cig, but this time I didn't want to have to quit that thing too. So this time, it's cold turkey, just Big Red gum. 

I have cravings a lot, and they are hard to stop, the guy I work with smokes a lot, and he said I can have one whenever I want. And it's damn near impossible to not grab it, but I did it! I couldn't be more proud of myself!

Usually every morning I read these threads, and they help a bunch, especially when I'm having a craving, I'll just read a short story. Haha

I hope you guys who are starting to quit and have quit know that you are awesome, we're all awesome!

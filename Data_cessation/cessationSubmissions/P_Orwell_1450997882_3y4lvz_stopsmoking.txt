Reducing to Quit

 This is going to be my seventh or so attempt to quit and my first one in several years. My previous attempts were mostly cold turkey, sometimes assisted by Nicorette products, and with one exception of 4 months they all failed spectacularly.

I have always thought that the reason I fail to quit is twofold. First I have always like smoking to the point of romanticization (I know it is stupid and childish but it is hard to disassociate smoking from "cool" in my mind). I guess this happens when you think Film Noir is awesome... My second reason is depression, which is the reason I started smoking in the first place. Recently however I have noticed a shift in both factors. I still romanticize smoking a bit but I am starting to dislike like it. It feels more like a chore than anything else. To me that seems like a hopeful sign but I am not sure if it a permanent shift or only temporary. As for depression, I still suffer but I have medication and understanding friends so I really don't think I need my old companions anymore. 

Due to those factor and recent fears of illness (I caught bronchitis a few months ago, the first time I have developed a "smoking illness") I think this is the time to quit. I am afraid of failing again though! Does anyone else have these issues? You still sort of like the idea of smoking but you need to stop or your afraid of collapsing into a depressive spiral if you do quit? Should I continue to reduce or just outright stop?

Stop Vaping Experiences?

A little bit of backstory:

I was a 1/2 PAD -  full PAD smoker since middle school (roughly 18 years) with numerous failed quit attempts over the years using the usual methods - cold turkey, patches, gum. I've also read Allen Carr. Recently, I gave myself an ultimatum, and set a no excuses quit date. I'm proud to say I've not had a cigarette in that time. But there were times, especially sitting in heavy traffic, that I was insane with craving, and managed to rationalize the use of an ecig. In the three weeks since I've stopped smoking, though, the nicotine content of my ecig has been tapered down to almost nothing (i mix 6mg and 0mg). 

I'm not writing this post, though, to look for confirmation or denial of whether or not it counts, whether i've really quit, etc. 

I get it, I'm still using a crutch, and I don't want to vape anymore either. 

I am writing this post to query those who have successfully used ecigs as a stepping stone to quitting smoking, and then quit vaping too. What was your experience? Did you experience withdrawals, and how did they compare to your traditional cigarette withdrawal symptoms? What would your advice be to me (and to others in this position), so that I can continue my journey to freedom?  


**tl;dr - Long time smoker successfully quit smoking a few weeks ago by transitioning to low-nic ecigs. I want to quit those, too. Please share your experiences.**

[vent] Finally quit and already struggling with cravings

  

Found out I need to have another (this will be the third) brain surgery on the 30th. ðŸ˜¢

This time it's a brain biopsy to take tissue and test it to see if the brain tumor has returned. I'm pissed off about it as well as stressed and anxious. Not only that, hubs and I just found out we are getting our first house, so we'll be moving out of our apartment by the end of September. 

I picked up the nicotine patch that my PCP prescribed. Smoked my last one this morning after going to the bank and slapped on the patch. 

I have the smoke free app and have been recording my cravings. My biggest issue is that smoking was built into my routines and was a way to deal with horrible anxiety. 

Luckily, my hubs doesn't smoke and I told my family and close friends I'm doing this. I'll have to avoid seeing certain people for a while since they smoke. 

I keep telling myself I have to f\*cking do this for my health and my bank account. I have quit cold turkey in the past so I know I can get through this since I have NRT. 

Just really needed to put it all down to say it to people who will understand. My husband and nobody in my immediate family has ever smoked, so they don't understand the difficulty in quitting an addiction. 

Thanks for letting me vent and have a great weekend!

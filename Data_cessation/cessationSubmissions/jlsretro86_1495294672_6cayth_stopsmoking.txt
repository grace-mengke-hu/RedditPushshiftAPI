Smelling that fresh air...

I went to Canada last weekend. The air is so much cleaner over there. One of my buddy is a smoker so I told him "no matter how much I beg, DO NOT GIVE ME A CIGARETTE." He is a good man so he said ok. We went out drinking for three days straight. Went to a casino and everybody was smoking. I tell you, it was tempting, but I told myself " If I even smoke a one cigarette, I am done." Throughout the whole trip, I didn't smoke a single cigarette. In fact, it smelled disgusting. I am almost 60 days in and I am glad I found this sub and having good friends. If you ever get an urge to smoke, go outside and take a deep breathe. Air is so underrated...

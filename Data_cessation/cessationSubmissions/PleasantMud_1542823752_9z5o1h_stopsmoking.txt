Starting this second

''Change happens when the pain of staying the same is greater than the pain of change.'' So says motivational speaker Tony Robbins. 

The pain of continuing to smoke is too great. Let's list the pain that smoking causes me:

- Makes me antisocial; always exiting conversations early and ducking out for a cigarette
- Empties my bank balance at an alarming rate 
- Ruins my skin, hair and teeth
- Blackens my lungs
- Subdues my sense of taste and smell 
- Makes me cough and gives me constant phlegm 
- Drains my energy 

No more you evil bastards. No more.

I set my app with a quit date of today Wednesday 21st November at 17:55. 12 minutes in. I believe in myself and I believe that I am finally free.

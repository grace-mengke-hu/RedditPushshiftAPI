Help - feeling close to relapse

I feel like I'm getting closer to relapse. My brother is here for the holidays and he's smoking. He left his cigs out and I took one, but I haven't smoked it yet.

I'm reading through the posts here trying to motivate myself. It's kind of working. Reading other people's stories about how they're trying to quit, and how miserable it is trying to quit. I don't want to have to quit again, I don't want the ridiculous, miserable withdrawals again.

Help.

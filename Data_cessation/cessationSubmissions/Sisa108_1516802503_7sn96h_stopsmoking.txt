72 Hours

I was compelled to read to avoid smoking when I first quit.  I think it's a comfort issue, I read a lot as a kid and a good book is distracting me. 
So I've been watching Hunting Hitler and decided to read Anne Frank's diary. 
What are some other good WWII books?  A couple years ago I read The Greatest Generation by Tom Brokaw and Unbroken, both excellent.

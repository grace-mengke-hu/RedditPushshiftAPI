A one of a kind story that ends in a question.

Hello all fellow quitters, I have an interesting story that I would like some advice on. First a brief description of my back story. So, I have a very rare bone disease that affects my physical appearance, mostly stature, bones and hair. (think elephant man without protrusions from my head but still a sore thumb) Anyway, I started smoking both weed and cigarettes at a very young age, 12 or 13 I think, which already comes with its own set of problems on top of my disorder. But I was habitual, smoke sessions 3 to 4 times a day, and after every one followed a cigarette. I am now 23, so imagine doing this literally every day for 10 years. I started having minor health problems my senior year, including the worst acne in school, and early balding signs. (My hair seemed to fall out the day I graduated high school) Fast forward to today, and I'm a year or so clean from cigarettes (quit cold turkey after almost dying over a ball of green flem in my throat) and now 2 days sober from weed. I know the body is capable of unimaginable things and everyone is different, but I've started seeing changes in my body that I'm now learning should have happened in puberty and it's honestly blowing my mind. So my question is, could the combination and severity of smoking so much have halted some changes that puberty should have caused? And is it possible for the body to recover and restart this process? (Hair has started slowly growing all over my body including my head that has been barren for almost 5 years now) has anyone ever seen or heard of this before?

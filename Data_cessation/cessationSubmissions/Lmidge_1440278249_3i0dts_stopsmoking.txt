I'm brand new to reddit and this forum is why.

We all need help and support when it comes to quitting. I read Allen Carrs easy way and was good for 7 days. Started again and am still smoking. I'm ready to try again. I'm terrified I will fail. Should I read it again to get some reinforcement?  I did find it empowering but my "downfall" was stress. Smoking doesn't even help eleviate stress! Anyways. Am I doomed?  Thank you!

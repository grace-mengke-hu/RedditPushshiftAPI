sleep problems five days in

Had my last cigarette on Friday. I'm excited to be reaching that one week point. I had some serious mood swings over the weekend, but I'm doing better now and don't have the same intense cravings I was having. The trouble is I've been waking up in the middle of the night - like 2 or 3 a.m. - and it takes forever to get back to sleep.  I usually have no trouble getting through a night. Has anyone had this issue when they've stopped? I thought cutting nicotine out was supposed to make you sleep more soundly.

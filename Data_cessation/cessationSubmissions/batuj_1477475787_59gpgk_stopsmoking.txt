Loss of IQ

Hi all

It has been just over a month for me however i don't know if it is due to quitting from smoking (i hope), I can't really think straight. 

Currently I'm in an important meeting but I feel like a car without gas as I can't really think or plan anything. Just giving the empty look to people.

Did you have this feeling? If you had at which point it disappeared?

Thanks!

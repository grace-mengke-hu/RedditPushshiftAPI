Its my birthday and im giving myself the gift of quitting

Fell off the wagon a while back and life got stressful.  Today August 22 is my birthday and now im ready to be done with smoking.  My last smoke was at 8:28pm today and I dont want to go back.  

Whats your best tip to deal with the first few days cravings?

I don't know what to do anymore!

So, this is my 4th day. I tidied up and cleaned my room. I ate 8 peaches and 5 apples. Been for a walk. Played some guitar. I rearranged the rat cage. I could start with some papers for the university, but I don't think, I can focus on a task like this now. I just can't think of any more ways to distract myself :-(

I'm gonna need some strength tomorrow

About a week ago I posted about my decision to quit. I've been doing pretty good about it too. Most of my cravings now only come from stop smoking ads or reading this sub and they are really short cravings. 

Part of the reason I said I am comfortable with quitting is because I finally left my stressful fast food kitchen job. Tomorrow though after getting off work from my nice non stressful job I will be going back to the old job just to help out on a single shift. 

I know it is going to be a stressful night and I am probably going to want a smoke more than I have at all since I quit. But I can do it. I'm gonna borrow some strength from y'all though for this trial.

quitting and chest tightness

I'm 23 years old and today is day #3 of quitting for me. For four years I have consumed nicotine in multiple way most commonly through mokes/moles/chops. Where you mix weed and tobacco in a bong and rip it in one hit. Around two months ago I started feeling constant tightness in my chest that really freaked me out. I went to the doctor and he gave me a chest x-ray and a pulmonary function test and said everything looks normal. This gave me a false sense of security and I started smoking cigs and moling again. Three days ago I had a panic attack and realized I was killing myself, destroyed all my bongs, threw out all my cigs and juuls. It so far hasn't been quite as bad as I thought it would be although the main reason I quit, the chest tightness, is even worse now on it's third day. Has anyone else had this experience, it's kind of a constant pinching or tightness in the right side of my chest sometimes it feels like a band all the way across my chest. Im kind of freaking out and just looking for anyone else with a similar experience. I know I hurt myself permanently from this but I'm scared i might just drop dead at any point.

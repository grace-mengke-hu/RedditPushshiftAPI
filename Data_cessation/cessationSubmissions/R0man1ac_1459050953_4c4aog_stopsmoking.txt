At day eight again!

Hey everyone.

Just wanted to give an update to keep holding myself accountable. I'm at day eight.. I won't lie and say it's been completely easy. On the second day I did have a few puffs of a cigarette. It made me feel sick, I immediately put it out. I did it again the following day. Haven't had any since, and refuse to. 

Last night was surprisingly easy. Worked eight hours by myself with nobody to talk to. Got super bored. Could have gone for a smoke, but I didn't the entire night. Same situation tonight, overnight work. But I refuse. Not going to do it. One day at a time, but I refuse REFUSE to ever become a smoker again.

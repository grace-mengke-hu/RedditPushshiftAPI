trying again - reducing

I know it's the wrong way and most difficult..

I know it has never worked until now..

But it's the only thing I can do unfortunately.

I need to quit vaping. I knew I was vaping too much, but I really enjoyed and yes I am badly addicted.

I have developed leukoplakia, it is small, ENT in jan was not concerned and said just scar tissue, I went to a new oral surgeon and said yeah it's small don't need biopsy, but do not smoke and do not vape.

Yey.

I suffer from anxiety, from chronic pain and I am since months looking for a medical diagnosis to pain/issues.. and it's scary. So my mental power it's quite low. My strength, happiness, willpower.. are low. Days are often difficult for pain, doctors visits and so on.

But.. I have to do it. I want to be able to.

I won't be cured of all my problems, but at least I can't blame myself anymore because I vape too much.

I have reduced the nicotine strenght. I have reduced the amount.

I was chain vaping for 5 years, I am around 120 puffs for the last three days and today I want to try to be at 100 and less every day. I don't have anymore nicotine shots and I have only 0mg juice.

It is being very hard. Light headed, constant cravings. Irritability.

I am walking more, going more to the gym, but I can't overdo for my other issues.

Waking up is the worse. Any moment of relaxing I want to be vaping. Or stress.

I will maybe post here how the reduction is going and if I am finally able to stop torturing myself and just quit vaping alltogether!

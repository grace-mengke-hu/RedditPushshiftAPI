Day 4--I know where the cigs are

So I gave my cigarettes to my spouse. The last few quit attempts, I destroyed the pack but he \(non\-smoker\) got pissy with me because they could be given to homeless people. Please don't lecture me; I think that if you're dealing with that much stress, you are allowed some nicotine vices. 

Regardless, those cigarettes were NOT given to anyone. I found them. Is it unreasonable to ask the he dispose of them? Or at least give them away? I'm going crazy knowing where they are. If I end up going through his bag to get them I am going to feel like a crazy person and I'm worried the temptation is too great.

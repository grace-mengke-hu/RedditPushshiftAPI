Encouragement

It's what I need on day four right now.  Went cold but weened for a couple months.  I've been focusing on getting the gym routine down but today is the rest day and my normal reward was to allow myself a few cigarettes after work on "rest" day.  So I feel it in my head and I can't get out of the thinking of it like I need to.

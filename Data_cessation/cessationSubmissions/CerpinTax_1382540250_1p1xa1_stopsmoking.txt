Day 4: My Nerves Hurt

My decision to quit smoking has happened to coincide with a highly stressful and busy time in my life. "On edge" doesn't do justice to how irritable I am. I have read on this sub (and believe) that smoking does not reduce stress or anxiety, but it is difficult to see it  that way right now. Looking for some pro advice on coping with the irritability until it normalizes a bit.

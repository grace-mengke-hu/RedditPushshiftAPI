Non smoker with an observation; It seems very clear to me that the stresses created by smoking far outweigh the stresses relieved by smoking.

I'm the heart transplant patient who's posted here before about how what you guys are doing is great. I have many smokers in my immediate family and I observe them. My crash education on the heart and other organs causes me to reflect a lot. Here's what I see regarding smoking stresses.

Financial, health, relationships, travel, cold/bad weather, can I smoke there, is the store still open, the cognitive dissonance of smoking, feeling helpless, needing to wake up in the middle of the night to smoke, rapidly decreasing places to smoke etc. Versus the short-lived stress reduction of smoking.

You can do this!!!!

Best tips to quit?

I've  juul about a pod a day for the past year and I'm ready to drop it completely.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm honestly scared for the withdrawals that are to come, but could someone give me tips on how to help it?

Also, how long do you think my withdrawals will last? Is this going to be a battle for a week? Month? Year?

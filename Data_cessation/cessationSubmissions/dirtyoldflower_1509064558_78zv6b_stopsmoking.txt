Thoughts about giving up cigs but still using a vape?

I started smoking around 16-17, and going through maybe 2 packs a week. I remember being on the fence about getting a vape, because I thought that it would make it more accessible and I was completely right. I don't have to worry about the smell ruining my place so I'm basically using it all day, and it doesn't make my lungs feel tight like cigarettes do and I feel basically normal. I'm torn from wanting to quit using it because I should, but at the same time enjoy it so much. And because of it I have probably only had like 4 cigs this year.

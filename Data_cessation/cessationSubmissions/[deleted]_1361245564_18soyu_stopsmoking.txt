I just hit one week...

As of ~3am (GMT) today  I have gone without cigarettes for the longest of period of time since I started; one week. And the best part is I'm pretty drunk and have been out all night and haven't touched a smoke. Last month I didn't even think that was an option....

Here's to another smoke free week! 

P.S you guys have helped massively. Cheers guys!

I feel weird posting here...

Maybe it's because I've never earnestly used one of these support groups before, but I feel very weird posting here. Talking about my struggles and whatnot. I know this might seem odd, but do you guys actually care? You know average people in the world, they don't care about about you at all. What makes you guys different? The addiction we share? 

Edit: About to smoke my last cigarette (quit attempt 9001).

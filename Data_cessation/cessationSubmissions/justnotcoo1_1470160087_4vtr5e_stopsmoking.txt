26 years of this is ENOUGH!

It was 1989 and cigarettes cost a dollar a pack. Everyone smoked back then. My parents, my teachers, my friends, it was so normal. Now I feel like a social outcast everytime I am seen smoking. I feel guilty and dirty. I feel a little white trash even. I have kids, 2 teenagers, they both hate it. I have a 7 year old who I have hid it from completely (almost). I stopped smoking in front of them yard ago but I they can smell it on me. I am so self conscious about that to. I am a chef and I go visit tables a few times a shift and I never get too close to the table because I don't want the guests to smell me. I am tired of these things controlling me. They dictate so much of my life. I honestly don't know how much, because me and the cigs have had this intimate and toxic marriage all these years. I am leaving that relationship today. I know there is going to be some sucky moments ahead. I am going to write here often. Writing makes me feel better. I am going to ask for support from other quitters. I am going to remember the destructive relationship I have had with these little fiendish white sticks, be annoyed, be angry and be sad. But at least I can be brave enough to face all that withdraw today. I have farmed out the kids so if shit gets too real here today I can at least spare them that. Also, lets face it, its a whole lot less stressful. I have asked my partner to smoke in his truck and not to bring those damn things in the house. I want no temptation. I have made it 5 and a half hours.

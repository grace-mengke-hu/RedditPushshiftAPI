So I think I need to quit...

My mom just came out of the operating room to get a pretty significant amount of cancer removed, and the whole time I was waiting, I chain smoked cigarettes. It felt wrong and gross, but it's been my pattern for so long. I find my problem mostly lies in the social aspect. Any tips?

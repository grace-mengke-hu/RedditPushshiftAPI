Difficult day

Day 12 of not smoking, today is the first day I really craved a cigarette, so I signed up on this site and downloaded a non smoking app.  This time I'm determined to stop, I am using a e cig, which I know is cheating but I donâ€™t think I could quit without it. Anyone else having craving after what I think is a long time after my quit date,  I won't give in to it but thought I need to do something different this time.

One year yesterday

Thanks to the Easy Way and this sub. 

When I first quit smoking I worried I'd always have cravings for the rest of my life and just overall never be happy as a nonsmoker. Boy was I wrong! After just one year I feel so far removed from smoking I can't even relate to what it was like. I have zero cravings ever.

So again, thanks!

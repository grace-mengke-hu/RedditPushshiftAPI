I just want one more, help!

I know how this road goes.  My first time seriously quitting.  Started off great.  But now I just want one more, one last one.  However, I know it's a never-ending cycle of "well.. just one more" another couple hours later.

How do you guys get over it?  I can get distracted for a little bit, but my usual distraction things end up with me thinking "ok now it's time for a smoke break," and then I remember that feeling never went away.

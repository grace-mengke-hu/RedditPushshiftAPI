Slips

About 1.5 year ago I quit a habit of smoking every night, 1 - 2 cigarettes every single night. [I did post about it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/201yw7/i_only_smokeed_a_maximum_of_2_cigarets_a_night/)
I was so addicted and it was really hard to kick it off, but I did.      
Now the bad part is that sometimes, maybe once a month or so, i go out with friends who smoke and I indulge. I probably smoke 1 -3 cigarettes. Then the day after I feel ridden with guilt. In any case, I have a strong conviction that I won't be returning to my original habit. 
Just wanted to share my experience and hear your thoughts .

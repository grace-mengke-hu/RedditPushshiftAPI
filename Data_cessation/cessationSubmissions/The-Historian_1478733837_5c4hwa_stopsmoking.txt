Boyfriend Being a Jerk

Okay smokers and exsmokers, be honest. My boyfriend has tried quitting smoking a few times and each time he starts acting like a raging butthole. I mean it. Abuse proportions.

I understand the first few days of quitting anything are rough. He keeps it going for a few weeks. I swear He's trying to break me down so I'll be like "For the love of God just smoke because clearly you can't live without it!" 

So is it true? Is he doing this to justify smoking to me and himself or is it really that bad?

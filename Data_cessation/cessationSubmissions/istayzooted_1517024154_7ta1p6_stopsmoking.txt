I just felt a sharp stabbing pain in my lung

Is this a really serious warning to quit or one of my lungs will collapse? My hands got really sweaty for a bit I thought it might actually happen.. fucking nicotine ugh I wish I never started.

 It went away after a few bowls of cannabis (I know what a good thing for it lol /s) but it works oddly enough. Time to look into champix or whatever it's called .. this is too much to handle that  hurt big time was debating going to the hospital for a couple minutes but I'm perfectly fine now. No pain at all it was also my left lung not both

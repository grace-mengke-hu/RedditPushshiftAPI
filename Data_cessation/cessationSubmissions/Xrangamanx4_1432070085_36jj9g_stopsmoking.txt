72 Hours in

I've been a smoker for 5 years at a pack/day. I finally mustered up the willpower to quit and I just hit the 3 day mark. I know this time I'm finally over it but I just feel super weird. I can't focus on anything or concentrate on my work at all and I'm going through a particularly busy time and I'm not sure if I picked the best time to quit. I don't plan on picking up cigarettes again but I'm just wondering how long this feeling will last and what I can do to speed through it.

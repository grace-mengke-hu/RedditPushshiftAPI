Silver Lining in my TIFU

Idk what happened reddit. I was going strong for 20 days and the cravings subsided after the first week. But today I smoked one because I just wanted to for some reason to find out what it was like again. It honestly tasted nasty and I coughed my brains out on the first puff lol. I don't really feel the urge to smoke again but I guess it was good to feel that cigarettes are beginning to taste nasty. I'm just pretty bummed that I fucked up after going strong but I'm still going to carry on. Don't give in family, it's totally not worth it.

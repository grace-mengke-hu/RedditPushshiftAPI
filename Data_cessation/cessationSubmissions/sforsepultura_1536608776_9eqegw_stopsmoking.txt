I want to quit and I don’t at the same time

Hi guys! I am new here! I am a smoker for 9 years now. Been fighting the cigs for about 1 year and I did managed to reduce from 1 pack a day to a couple of cigs during work hours, like 2-3 a day, although, I can’t give up completely. Jesus, it doesn’t even feel good as it used to before. I feel like it is killing me. I don’t want that. I still can’t give up completely. I am like fuck cigarettes why do I even smoke them? And then I get that fucking craving for one from time to time, which makes me feel like it is going to be awesome, but is not. Never is.

I know my smoking issues are nothing compared to many of you. But for me, it is still a issue and I would like to overcome it.  Can I get ideias of how to do it? 

Thanks a lot!

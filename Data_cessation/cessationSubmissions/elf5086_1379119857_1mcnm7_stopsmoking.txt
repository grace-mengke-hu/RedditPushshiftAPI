E-Cigs

What do you all think of e-cigs? I've been smoking for the past 7 years. Probably at least a pack a day for the past 4.  I'm finally trying to commit to quitting.  I bought an e-cig a few days ago and haven't smoked a real cig since.  I still would damn near kill for a real smoke, but I can manage if I hit the e-cig here and there. Have any of you all quit using e-cigs?

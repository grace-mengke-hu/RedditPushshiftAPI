My SO has quit but stress levels now off the charts, I'm at a loss with how to help and support him. Please help!!

Hi all!



I'm hoping you guys can help me with a situation I'm currently in. For context, I'm a non-smoker


**TL;DR:** SO quit smoking 3-4 weeks ago but stress levels have risen dramatically and he sees no other release for it other than smoking. I don't know how to support him



**Long version:**



My SO has recently quit smoking (was smoking about 40 reds over about 3 daysish, I'm not sure if thats "heavy" or not). 



He stopped 3 weeks ago, was on patches for the first week but nothing after that. His only motivation to quit was money (we live in a country with massive taxes on tobacco) and he has said many times if it wasn't for that he would happily keep smoking. 


Health is not a concern for him (which is a thing that hurts me a little but that's a different issue for another day. At the end of the day I guess it's not my business)



Terrible timing but we also are in the middle of moving house which has elevated his stress levels a lot. I made the mistake last night of asking how he was  going and feeling about the no cigarettes thing and he got really frustrated saying he just wants to buy more or at least some pipe tobacco to destress. He said he has no other way to relieve stress. I suggested maybe we both could go to the gym or something but he's totally not interested. 


For some context, he is usually a REALLY good communicator, even if he's had a horrific week he never ever takes it out on anyone and is open about things. We've never fought before this. We still haven't really but things have been extremely tense. 


I'm at a loss of what to do.. I don't know what else I can suggest for stress that isnt smoking and he seems to get really irritated if I even bring it up but I feel unsupportive if I just ignore it. What else can I do? 



I'm at the point where I feel I should just buy him some pipe tobacco until we figure out a better approach but I also feel this would be the worst solution as it would take him back to square one, but, I don't know what other option I have.. I now feel like I have a SO who's a completely different person who I'm scared to talk to sometimes out of fear of frustrating him. He has NEVER been like this before. I want to help but I don't know how. We have a very healthy sex life and we're fine financially so those 2 things are fine at least. 



Has anyone here been in this situation where they felt they couldnt find anything else  to destress but eventually found a solution? 



I'd really appreciate any advice I can get! 


Thanks :)

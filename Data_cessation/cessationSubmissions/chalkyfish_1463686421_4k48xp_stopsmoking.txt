Feel like ranting

I messed up at the weekend and had to reset my badge, but that's not why I want to rant. I was talking with my friend who also smokes on and off normally when he's drinking, but sometimes not. He started going on about how he has never been addicted to smoking, and he can stop whenever and he's been smoke free for two weeks and its fine.

I guess I was pissed off because a) nicotine is obviously addictive, so that's a blatant lie and b) I find it really hard to quit, and it pisses me off he's acting like it's super easy.

This is just a rant, but I hate when people act like admitting you are actually addicted to smoking means you're worse than them somehow. We are all addicts! At least I can admit it.

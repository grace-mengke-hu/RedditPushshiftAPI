It’s been a little over a week but...

Well I guess I just need encouragement or reassurance or something. It’s been maybe 8-10 days since I quit and I thought my breathing would get better, not feel like it’s worse! I just can’t seem to get enough air, chest always has that funny “breathe more bro” feeling. I know this is the best thing I can do for myself and will not go back but, it’s getting frustrating because my good ol health Anxiety kicks in when it feels like I can’t breathe and just makes it worse. I smoked for about six years and I’m only twenty six. There was a one year lapse from last time I stopped smoking, stress got the better of me two years ago which is why I started again. I figured I’d breathe better if I quit again which is why I even quit and last time I didn’t have this problem!

Will it ever go away?

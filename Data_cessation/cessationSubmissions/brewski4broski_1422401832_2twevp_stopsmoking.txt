Have you quit without the help of books or medication? Help me then

What did you do?

I stopped over a year ago with the help of Allen Carr's book. I have no desire to smoke again ever. My girlfriend is slowly reading the book now, but to be honest with you my faith in her stopping with that alone isn't that great. I know, that's not a positive attitude, but I just get this feeling she doesn't want to stop, she's just doing it because I think she knows if she doesn't stop the relationship is over (I never said that, but I think she feels it)

Do you have any tips or suggestions to offer me if Allen Carr doesn't work for her? I am not showing her this post, or even going to bring it up unless I need to. Any kind of advice will do and be much appreciated.

I know I may come across as a pessimist here, but it's not leading over to our relationship. I'm only positive with her, and just want to be prepared ;)

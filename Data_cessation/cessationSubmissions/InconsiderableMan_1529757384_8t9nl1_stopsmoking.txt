Day 5: Finally managing

Last Monday, I had 10 minutes until the stores closed to buy a pack of cigarettes. I promptly visited the supermarket, bought some coffee and bread. Back home I realized I forgot about the cigarettes and I became distressed about being out of cigs for the night.

This moment made me vividly recall what it was like to be addicted to weed. I previously had been a heavy weed smoker, with a daily urge to use. When I would be out of weed, I would not have a nice day. I gave up weed at age 22 and switched to cigarettes - some kind of attempt to fill the void smoking weed left behind.

Back to Monday night, I concluded it was pathetic to feel distressed about being out of cigarettes and just. ... quit cold turkey. The next day was hard but Wednesday I wanted to shoot myself. Spent half that day in bed having cold sweats. Thursday wasn't any better. 5 days in now and it's manageable. I do get cravings, but it's somewhat easy to distract myself by eating food, which isn't a problem because I'm not overweight.

Moral of this story is; if you want to quit... don't do it for someone else. Do it for yourself. Find your own reason. Many people have always said to me 'you should quit, It's bad for your health'. Well you know what? I don't give a \*\*\* about my health. Oh it's expensive? I make too much money anyway, I can afford it. I smell bad? Yes, how is that my problem?  

My reason is; I want to challenge myself into living a healthier lifestyle. I wan't to be in control. If I can manage to do this cold-turkey, I can beat any challenge.

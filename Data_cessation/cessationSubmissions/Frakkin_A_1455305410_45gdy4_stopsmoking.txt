Why is this getting harder, not easer, after 4 days?

Hey everyone,

It's been great getting to know you all here. I'm sending my best vibes out to all of you!

That said, I have to get this out. This is my first quit attempt ever, and I'm going cold turkey. I'm on day 4, and this is by far the hardest day I've had. It's funny, yesterday I felt (mostly) great. I was full of hope, excitement, and I even had meals without wanting a cig after! It was awesome. 

However, last night I hit a wall. I lost most of my appetite, slept like shit, and this morning I can't stop thinking about smoking. I'm feeling sleepy, super aggressive and agitated, and nauseous as all hell. 

I go between thinking, "If this is what nicotine does to me, then fuck it! I will never go back!" to thinking, "I'm really my best self when I smoke. I'm more productive, happy, and I'll never be able to reach my full potential without nicotine."

I know the latter thought is false. Today is really fucking hard, and surprisingly physical. I figured after 3 days I'd be done with the physical withdrawal. 

Has anyone else had that experience? You're doing very well, and then out of nowhere you just want to curl up in a ball and die? I've felt that way constantly for the past 6 hours!

I haven't relapsed. I want to...but I wont. I refuse. It HAS to get better.

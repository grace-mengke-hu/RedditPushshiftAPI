Venting

So I quit smoking and drinking at the same time a little over 3 months ago.

Quitting smoking is so fucking annoying. I got off of nicotine 28 days ago and I still feel like shit every day. 

I craved alcohol for 2 or 3 weeks and haven't wanted it much since. But I want a cigarette every fucking day. I'm irritable as hell, snapping at my boss and my friends, crying randomly and so anxious that I'm certain that I can literally feel my heart muscle hardening.

I'm actually thinking about going to the doctor for some medicine to get these feelings to go away but I feel like I'm just picking the same solution as I always have except with a different substance.

I know if I carry these feelings around too long I could smoke over it, and I don't want to do that. So, I'm reaching out as a solution instead of smoking.

It's 7 pm where I live and I'm pretty sure I'll be able to make it through until I go to bed without a cigarette. No matter how shitty my day was, any day I don't smoke is a good day. I'm just tired of feeling so stressed and anxious and like fucking shit every day.

Acid Reflux??

Has anyone had acid reflux symptoms since quitting?  Last weekend I went deep sea fishing. Associated the sickness to simple sea sickness at the time. Well happened again, yesterday and today and I was no where near the sea. I typically have absolutely NO issues and can eat anything spicy or dink alcohol with no issues. Omg this is awful. It's mostly in my chest area and upwards. Like my throat is closing up too. I've had one bout with actual nausea as well. Feels better to lay down though than sit up and can last for hours, lots of hours. Any insight, suggestions, stories etc. would be appreciated. Started at about 5-6 weeks after quitting.

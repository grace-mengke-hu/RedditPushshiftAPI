Gave in after a day and a half, just reset my badge :(

Smoker for about 8 years total, putting away around 6-7 per day for the last 3.5 years. I made it to the 1 day 13 hour mark but gave in to the monster and just reset my badge. I'm feeling pretty guilty about it. I'm about 2/3 of the way through The Book -- any helpful tips for overcoming days two and three would be helpful! I know I can do this, I just need to get myself in the right mindset.

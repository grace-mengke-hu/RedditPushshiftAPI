First week.

Looking back, it's been a week, right down to the day and hour, since I quit. The physical withdrawal has been a cakewalk. Just a couple days of feeling light-headed and the odd craving or two. Now, here, a week later, it feels like more of a struggle. I'm pretty sure I'm hitting the psychological portion of the withdrawal, built up over 17 years, now. Cravings are a lot worse, plus there's a bit of irritability/depression that's looming. I've managed to keep myself clear of it thus far. Seems like a shame to let a whole week smoke-free go to waste.

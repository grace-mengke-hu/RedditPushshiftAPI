I will never smoke again, VI

I don't feel addicted anymore.

What worked for me:

For me seems it is trying something new. It wouldn't work to read Allen Carr again. Or just requesting badge reset in /r/stopsmoking

Instead I posted here, promised not to ever smoke again. It's been huge help from you guys.

And android app. I just loved to see how my addiction time flows away in the first days when cravings were the hardest.

Any miracles happened? No, just feeling good.

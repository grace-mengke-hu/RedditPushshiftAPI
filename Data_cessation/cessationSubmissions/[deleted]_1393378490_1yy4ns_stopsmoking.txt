This is embaressing but I'm super close to buy a pack, after deciding to quit a few days back

You might have read my other post about being sick and deciding to quit while the fever kept me from smoking. As I'm now 3 days in and no longer sick, my mind and my body wants to "reward" myself, and I can't see any better reward than a pack of smokes. 

Stupid, makes no sense, irrational, I KNOW. But everything is black and white right now. I see no joy in anything. The embaressing part is how quickly I went from being determined and passionate about quitting, to this state of failure (even though I haven't bought a pack yet)

The only reason I've not yet bought a pack is because its 02:30 AM here and the stores are closed. And tomorrow is my last sick day from work, perfectly coinciding with the release of a big game expansion. And my scumbag brain tells me to reward myself after these few days of sickness, with a whole day of gaming, fast food and cigarettes.

Sorry for the wall of text. I'm just venting here.

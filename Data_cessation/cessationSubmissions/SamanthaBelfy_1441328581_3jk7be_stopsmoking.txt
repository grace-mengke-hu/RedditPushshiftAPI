Hey I'm new here!

So I've finally decided that I need to quit. I've been smoking a ridiculously long time, really since my early teens. The only breaks I've had are for pregnancy and nursing afterwards. I've tried quitting more times than I can count. 
This time it's going to be different. My main trigger was being sick for a month. I know it wouldn't have lasted as long if I would have just not smoked but of course that didn't happen. Another thing was my daughter saying "mom why do you always have to go outside" and I just felt guilty. 
My quit date is Tuesday because a weekday will be better for me since I don't have much opportunity during the day anyway. I'm so nervous because I have such a strict routine for my entire life and always have my usual cigarettes at certain times. Any tips????
I should also say I'm going to be cheating a little with a vaporizer. It's really helped me cut back the last couple weeks
Also, my husband smokes and is not interested in quitting. I'm so nervous because they'll be around and so tempting!!
Super rant I'm sorry!

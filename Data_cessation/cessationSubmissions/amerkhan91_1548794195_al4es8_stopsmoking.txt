It gets harder

i started cold turkey 5 days ago without setting a date prior.  My friend tried to quit a few days ago and i joined him without any planning.  He had the issue of getting stronger and more frequent urges than i did and he was a more frequent smoker than me. I tried to stop him a lot today but he still smoked one and i had a really strong urge too but i controlled it somehow in the moment but i feel really depressed right now and i feel that im not ready to quit completely just yet.

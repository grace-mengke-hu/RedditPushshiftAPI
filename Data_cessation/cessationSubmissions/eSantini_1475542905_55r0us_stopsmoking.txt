Came home for vacations, got drunk with a lot of smokers and I didn't smoke a bit!!

I was so worried that I was going to wake up one of these days feeling lots of regrets for smoking but nope... I get to keep my shiny little star on my badge ;)

It wasn't super easy tho, I do remember a couple of times when I was so close to grabbing one and hitting a drag. Some friends didn't know I quit and kept offering but I always said NO.

2 more days of vacations, 1 more party with smokers, but I'm so happy because now I know how easy it is to say no.

I'm gonna repeat my advice to newcomers, never let your guard down and avoid getting drunk.

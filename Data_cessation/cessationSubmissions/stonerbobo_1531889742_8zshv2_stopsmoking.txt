Ex-smokers: Did stopping reduce GERD symptoms for you?

I’ve been having a bad bout of GERD/acid reflux for a month now. Stomach pain, vomiting, nausea and diarrhea. I’m pretty sure its GERD b/c it gets worse with acidic foods and smoking.

Did anyone who quit notice reductions in this kind of thing? My diet etc is OK so I’m wondering if smoking is the big factor causing this now.

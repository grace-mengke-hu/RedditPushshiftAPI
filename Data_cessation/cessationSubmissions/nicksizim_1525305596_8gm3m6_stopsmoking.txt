I am smoke free for 6 days but Mouth Ulcers killing me

Is anyone have these little creepy ulcers for quitting cigs? It's all over my mouth so i cant eat. I am depressed, had headaches and this ulcers. Sometimes i think fck this lets smoke but if i smoke i ll smoke for this ulcers to go away. Any advise and motivation accepted. Sorry for my shitty grammar but i cant get my head straight.

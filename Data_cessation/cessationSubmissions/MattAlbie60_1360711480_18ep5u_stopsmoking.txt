Help me battle my scumbag brain.

I registered here literally just to use this subreddit, ha. Longtime lurker, first time poster, so on, so forth.

Okay, so I made it six days. Six whole days, almost to the minute. The thing is, those entire six days I knew something hadn't quite stuck.

It's not like I was in physical pain or anything. The whole "withdrawal" part really is as bad as the Carr book says - which is to say, not at all. But something about those six days had me going "Yeah, I don't think this time is it, for some reason."

I acknowledge that I don't get anything out of cigarettes, or this cigar that I'm smoking right now. I acknowledge that those six days were pretty rad, as I didn't smell like smoke and I could taste stuff and whatnot. But for some reason, I just wasn't serious about it. 

Anybody else go through something similar? Something along the lines of "I really don't know why I'm about to smoke, but I'm definitely about to smoke?" How did you beat it?

Maybe I need to read the Carr book again, I don't know. I feel like I'm one "Eureka" moment away from never doing this again, but I can't quite figure out what that moment is yet.

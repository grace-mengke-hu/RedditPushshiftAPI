Suggestion on quitting

Hey guys,

So I'm looking for some advice on quitting tobacco. I quit about a year ago using an e-cig as an alternative and was tobacco free for about 3 months before finally giving in and smoking one with my friend, thinking it was only one and before I knew it I was back on cigarettes. I have a habit of smoking tobacco with my weed so it really makes it feel like I'm missing out if I try to go cold turkey and just the thought of that scares me, in turn making me smoke. 

I just finished reading "the book" but every time I think about going cold turkey It still makes me feel like I am going to be missing out on something (especially since I put tobacco in my weed). Either way I was thinking of going back to using the e-cig in the mean time, but this time maybe try to cut back on the e-cig after quitting. Last time I quit I believe I was using the e-cig more in the end and didn't even think about quitting that. Would you guys suggest using an e-cig first, given the fact that when I think about quitting with that as an alternative, it doesn't scare me as much thinking about life without cigarettes.

-Thank you, all advice is appreciated.

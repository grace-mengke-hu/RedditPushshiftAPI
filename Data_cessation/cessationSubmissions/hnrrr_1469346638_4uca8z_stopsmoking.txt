Had a cig last night, but its okay I realised I didn't like it

I went 84 straight days without a ciggie. It was really hard to say no and so many people around me smoke. There have been so many times that I really wanted to smoke and been offered a ciggarette but then said no and I'm proud that I've made it this far without caving in. 

Well last night my vape ran out of battery (I dont vape regularly just when I drink) and my friend handed me a ciggie, I thought about giving it back to him but then just kept it in my pocket. Throughout the night I kept thinking about it and eventually lit it up. At first it felt great, like satisfying a great craving but then eventually it became pretty shitty. It wasn't as good as I made it out to be in my head and my lungs couldn't hold as much smoke as I could before and every inhale I felt like coughing. This morning when I woke up my throat hurt and I remembered that I used to be used to feeling like this every morning but now it just feels uncomfortable. 

I don't count this as a failure, its okay to fall out every once in awhile, its actually made me dislike smoking a bit more and destroyed the mental feeling that I thought it would give me. Now should I change my badge to start over or just continue from the day I decided to quit officially?

Really really scared

after losing 80 pounds (thanks r/Loseit) I was finally in a good place to donate blood again. During the health screening process my blood pressure reading was "high". I was almost turned away. I was so sure with all the weight loss that my blood pressure would be near normal. But the reality is weight loss isn't enough, the smoking has got to end too. 

when I came face to face with that realization, I smoked a bunch of cigarettes out of stress. Typical!  And I started feeling like my heart was racing. After a few hours of that pity party I resolved to quit last night. But I still feel like my heart is racing. It's scaring me. I'm also scared I can't do this. I'm 54 and got to get it together, it might already be too late.

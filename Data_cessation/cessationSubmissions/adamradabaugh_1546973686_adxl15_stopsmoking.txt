Serious question, cigs making me feel sick

So I've been smoking since I was 15, I'm 22 now, never had any problems but now for some reason every time I smoke a cigarette It gives me a headache and it almost feels like i have to puke also, I'm not sure why, I smoke the same brand I've always smoked and last night after I smoked a cigarette I felt so bad I had to go to sleep and now it's happening again today, I was wondering if anybody here might have some similar experience and know what's going on, thanks.

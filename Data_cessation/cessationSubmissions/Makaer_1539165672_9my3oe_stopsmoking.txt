Smoking and alcohol

I’ve been smoking off and on the past couple of years, quitting several times, but I always ended up smoking when drinking. 

I’m just looking for any advice or ideas to help me mentally get over that hurdle. I get nervous whenever I know I’m going drinking after I have quit and it makes me dwell on smoking so much that I end up doing it.

Trans girl here, starting HRT soon so time to throw away the smokes!

Hey guys! Since I'm starting hormones in about a month or so, I decided it was time to kick the habit now instead of right before. For those who don't know, smoking while on HRT is a recipe for bad news. Today is my second day smoke free, and I can already feel it's gonna be an uphill battle.

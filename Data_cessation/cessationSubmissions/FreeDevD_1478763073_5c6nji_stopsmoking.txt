Day 1

Just quitted. I have quitted so many times in the past.  So little confidence and so hate for myself :( This time I would give it permanently with reddit. Seeing so many people badges is very hopeful. So hopefully this would be my last attempt. I have already read allen carr but looking for some support and maybe joining people who are also at same stage.

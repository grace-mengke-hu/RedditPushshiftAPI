Quitting again, and feel so confident this time!

Hey! This is my first ever post in stopsmoking, and I'm glad to be a part of the community! 

I've smoked for about 3.5 years now, and I have hated almost every cig I've had. I've tried to quit a few times, my longest run being 1 month when I quit with my girlfriend of the time (that made it a hell of a lot easier). 
I've always told myself that cold turkey is the only way to go, and I still think it's the BEST way to go. However, i've recently bought a Vapouriz e-cigarette. Although I am currently probably more addicted to it than I ever was real cigarettes, I don't really care. All I care about is that I haven't even thought about having a cigarette the past two days. I bought my e-cig 4 days ago and went to the pub with friends the following day. My attitude of the time was, 'as long as I'm cutting down I'm proud, so one cigarette won't hurt'. I had two that night, and I can safely say that... well, I just didn't enjoy them. I used to love a cigarette after a while of quitting simply because I got the nicotine I needed, but when I have my e-cigarette to do that job I have absolutely no reason to want a cigarette! 

Despite the fact I'm getting my nicotine, I've still been pretty agitated and fatigued. I'm guessing that's the lack of carbon monoxide/tar/chemicals cigarettes are filled with?

Anyway, lets get this show on the road! Day 2 is nearly over :D

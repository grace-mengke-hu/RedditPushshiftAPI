Stay strong, soldiers, I'm about to join you!

Going cold turkey within this night. Have been smoking for \~9 years, tried numerous times, but was giving up within the first day, because there was always "something difficult coming next day or week or whatever". Basically, as soon as first real cravings came, I was just blushing it off for later. It was way too easy to do since I never told anyone I am quitting, maybe because I was so afraid of it.

Kept hiding it from my family all those years, and I don't really have friends/SO/whoever who'd care, so I want to at least say it there on /r/stopsmoking. Today is the day simply existing and running away from my problems stops and living an actual life starts, as hard as the beginning of this road might be.

Stay strong, soldiers, I'm about to join you!

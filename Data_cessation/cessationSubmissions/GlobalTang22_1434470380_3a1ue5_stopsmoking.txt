First day of freedom

I'm 22, i've been smoking a pack a day for three years, and today is my first nicotine free day.  I've read Allen Carrs book and I know i'm ready for this.  I hope this subreddit can help inspire me every day!  I am tired of being a slave to cigarettes, vapes, nicotine gum, and everything else.  I'm tired of spending thousands of dollars and having people comment on how I smell and desperately needing a cigarette every 25 minutes.  I know I can end this starting now.

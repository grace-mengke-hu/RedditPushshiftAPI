Quit smoking and can barely breath

I had been nicotine free for 3 years. But  while being on holiday I randomly decided to have a smoke with my uncle  while have a few beers .which lead to buying a packet which led me to smoking back home and then  flat out heavy smoking for about 3 months solid. nightmare of a time trying to quit 

Thankfully I've been nicotine free for about a month now. But I  can barely breath. My chest is tight and I can't  completely relax  from the difficult breathing.
 
I know this is my lungs healing and clearing themselves out.

Is there anything I can do to speed things up besides running

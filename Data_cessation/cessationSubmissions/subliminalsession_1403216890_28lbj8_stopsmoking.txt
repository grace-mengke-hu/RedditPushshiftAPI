is anybody else stressed as hell??

i was getting to a very unbearable point the day before yesterday where i would just break down in tears every five minutes. i don't want a cigarette, my mind is just torturing me in telling me i can't quit something, etc. this upset and anxiety seems to have disappeared and been replaced with blind rage. i get angry when i can't find my keys, when i miss a phone call, when the sun blinds my eyes, hell i'm angry at everything and i never used to be this angry when i smoked i swear :/ 

i thought exercise was helping me, so today i took it to extremes at the gym and now i can hardly walk. and i'm still angry. does anybody have any tips on how to make this better, or a general idea of how long this anger is gonna last? it's driving me literally insane :@

will i start smoking if i start partying/drinking?

Hello, i stopped smoking about 4 weeks ago yay me (:
one of my best memories of smoking is in the morning with a hot cup of coffee and when i'm at a party with lots of booze involved. My question is, is it easy to start smoking again at a party and what can i do to prevent it?
do you feel the urge to start smoking again when you're drunk at a party?

7 days

Today marks 7 days nicotine free. First day was hell I don't know how I made it through. Then it started getting easier. Friday night I went out with a buddy and had a few too many drinks. Didn't smoke though. But the past two days have been pretty hard for me. The physical cravings are for the most part gone but now it's just an empty feeling all day long. I will continue to fight the part of me that wants to smoke. Going to go see a movie that should help distract me.

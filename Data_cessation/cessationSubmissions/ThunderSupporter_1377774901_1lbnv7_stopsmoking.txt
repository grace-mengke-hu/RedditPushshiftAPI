Why always so hungry?

Hi,

I never had problems in making breaks with smoking - I had month, 3 months, week breaks - always came back, always was something. But that's other story. I want to ask why the hell I'm always so hungry when trying to have a break or stop smoking? Right now I don't smoke  because I'm not going out after all - even that I have something to do here, in the house I eat much more than usual. How do I fight it? Normally I'd go for a smoke and I'd beat hunger for another few hours :)

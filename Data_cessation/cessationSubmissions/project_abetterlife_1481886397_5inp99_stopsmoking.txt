Slipped yesterday: my issue seems to be destructive thoughts and not knowing how to handle frustration with others

Hi,

Last night there was a very frustrating situation in my life (let's just say that it involved having to be in the rain with 2 friends waiting for the police to show up and listening to insults, wishes for evil in my life and illogical rants from a stranger, feeling unsafe and only getting home at almost 2AM).

Of course, when I got home I was really frustrated with the stranger and the situation. I had asked the taxicab driver who got me home (and who I had seen smoking) for a cigarette and after some hesitation I did smoke it. Well, 80% of it. 

Now the interesting part is that I did not want a cigarette because it is precious or I trust it to calm me down. I wanted it because I knew it would make me feel awful and hate myself. And that, I am familiar with. The feeling of anger or frustration with others when they behave  in a bad way and it makes no sense is something I have a very hard time with. I can perfectly handle being angry with people who are lazy at my job. There's a reason and I can understand that. When the bad behaviour of others makes no sense, however, I have now realized that, instead of acting out, hitting things, crying or whatever, I usually find some way to turn that anger into myself by doing something that I know will harm me. Up till now it has been either staying up till far too late or smoking. 

Urges for boredom or habit reasons I can win reasonably with either reasoning or willpower. But this is actively choosing to do something to harm myself to redirect my frustration. This is "hating myself is far, far easier to handle than hating others". Feeling anger at others scares me. 

So, please help me: ideas, advice, people with destructive urges that have overcome it, all help will be very welcome.

I am restarting today as a non-smoker. I want this.

What do (or did) you do with anger?

     I’m so pissed at my husband. I was trying to tell him about something I wanted to do this weekend. As usual, he started offering helpful suggestions and comments. 
     Normally, his suggestions and comments don’t bother me. Actually, he’s pretty smart and usually has good ideas. But I’m on day eight of stop smoking and I want to murder him.
     These extreme flashes of anger are the thing I find the most difficult to deal with and the most difficult trigger to resist. Any suggestions you have I would appreciate. But please don’t tell me to punch a pillow. That tends to just make me more angry. Thanks.

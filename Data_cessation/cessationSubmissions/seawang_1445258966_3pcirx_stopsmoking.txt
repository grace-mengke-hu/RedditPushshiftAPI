Bad news and good news

Welp. Got blasted last night, broke and smoked for the first time in almost two years.

But! I Hated it. It didn't taste good, it didn't feel good, it didn't curb any social awkwardness that I felt being out. I used to smoke daily and I didn't feel anything- I took just about 3 puffs of someone else's cig last night and I can feel it in my throat today. 

I'm still pretty disappointed that I did it, but I'm glad it went so poorly. I don't see it happening again any time soon. 

P.s. This hangover though...

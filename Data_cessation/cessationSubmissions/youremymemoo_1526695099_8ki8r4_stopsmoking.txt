Sending positive vibes to everyone this weekend. Especially for us Canadians who are facing the first summer holiday- We are strong and we can do it!

It's been a long dark winter here in Canada, and May long weekend marks the start of our summer season. Often this comes with alcohol, friends, family, that oh so nostalgic feeling that can come with smoking triggers and associations. I will not smoke this weekend and hope you won't either!

Have a great May Long!!

Beginning of the end

Well here I am, just having smoked my last cigarette and threw away the rest of my pack. I have failed to quit too many times to count at this point, and that has been discouraging. But reading through this sub I see all the success stories and know that its possible if I allow myself to succeed. 

So this time I am going to try to actually be active here and reach out for support unlike most of my attempts. Im also trying to utilize mindfulness more this time to help avoid moments of stress where I go into "autopilot" and instinctively drown my sorrows in smoke. Instead of viewing it as a loss I'm trying to reframe it as a healing process that will be exciting and positive! I know its going to be hard to remember that when cravings hit thought.

Not really sure where I'm going with this post, just kind of jotting some thoughts down and sharing them with you guys for a little bit of accountability, so thanks for reading if you got this far, any words of encouragement will be much appreciated if you have them :) and to anyone starting their quit with me, cheers! We can do this

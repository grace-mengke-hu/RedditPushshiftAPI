So this is terrible. Advice?

It's only technically been three days. I cut down to two and then one cigarette a day because the CDC said 95% of people who try to quit cold turkey relapse. So this is week one with none. 

I literally joined reddit just now for support because no one is really getting how difficult this is. 

Any advice would be awesome. I couldn't sleep last night bc I was craving a cigarette. Now I'm late for work.

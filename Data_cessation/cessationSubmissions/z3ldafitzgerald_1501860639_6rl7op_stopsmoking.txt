1 week Today

1 Week ago I quit smoking cold turkey.  This isn't my first time quitting.  I'm 23 and picked up my first cigarette in 8th grade (age 13 or so).  I've quit for long periods of time before, but this time I want it to be for good.  I've created a mantra "I want to live a long and healthy life" .. when  I get strong cravings I try to repeat this to myself. 

I just got out of a year long abusive relationship a month ago.  My ex and I would smoke together, and that's how my habit started up again.  It's helpful for me to think about it this way:  I don't want his bad habits hanging around me.  Also I miss being my athletic, happy, active self.  I was starting to feel constantly fatigued, out of breath, heart racing, all around terrible.  I'm too young to feel so old. 

I'm nervous because tonight i'll be going to a party, and wherever there's booze and my social anxiety involved, it makes my urge to smoke so much worse.  

Cheers, happy Friday, here's to quitting!

What can I recommend to smokers of 20+ years?

I'm in the process of trying to quit smoking myself, but I'm really hoping to help my mom and stepdad quit as well. I lost my dad to lung cancer in Oct 2011 (on his 55th birthday,) and I don't want to lose anyone again. They are both extremely heavy smokers, especially my stepdad who is a truck driver. I was just wondering if anyone could suggest things that have really helped them, especially if they've smoked for such a long time.

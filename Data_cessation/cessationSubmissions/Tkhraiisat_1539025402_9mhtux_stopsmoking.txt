Community Pressure

I lost track on how long I’ve gone without smoking, I haven’t smoked in about 6 months approximately. 

Now here is the thing I live in the Middle East, and the majority of people there smoke, you see cigarettes packs everywhere, everyone on the streets is holding a cigarette, it’s so casual. Nearly every relative smokes and every student at my school “juuls”.

so here I am having internal social pressures which lead to craving a cigarette, I don’t know where this craving came from as I haven’t touched a cigarette for 6 months and counting, I’m having really intense cravings. I go out for runs and I’m overall a healthy person but I also want to say fuck it and buy a pack of cigarettes and start smoking like everyone else in my community.

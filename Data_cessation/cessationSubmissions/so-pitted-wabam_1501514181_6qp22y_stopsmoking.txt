Day one (again)

Here we are again, had I not slipped, I would have over a year, but I did, so here's a chance to remember how strong I am!!
I started smoking again last month when my uncle committed suicide. His step son/my cousin is a smoker and in grieving with him I thought just one would be ok. Wrong!!! It was about 2 shameful weeks on real cigarettes immediately after that and I've been on an ecig for the past 2 weeks.
Today I'm done letting nicotine steal me from me, and for good this time. No more excuses, no more feeling sorry for myself. This is my life, my body. Never another puff. My uncle was a successfully quit smoker for about 25 years, he would want the same for me.
This time's for us, me and uncle Marsh.

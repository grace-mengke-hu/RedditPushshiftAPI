Okay so I’m in a unique situation

(Too long didn’t read on the bottom) 

I use to smoke cigarettes a lot but never bought packs. Just sometimes here and there. Would always get a cigarette from a friend, co worker, I use to smoke to just past the time. 

The last time I had cigarettes was during a shroom trip, in July of 2017. I smoked a whole pack of Marlboro lites in 8-9 hours. (That’s how long the trip was). Anyway, after that day, I never craved it, and eventually never had a cigarette after that because after that trip, I would get nauseous from the smell, or even sight/thought of a cigarette. (I AM NOT CONDONING YOU TO GO TAKE A SHROOM TRIP) 

Recently, last month I decided to quit smoking weed as well. I’m now a month an 3ish weeks clean from weed, but starting around last week, I’ve been craving cigarettes and I have no idea why. Sadly, I did fall into the craving and went a copped a pack. And smoked 6 cigarettes in one sitting. 

I know the damages of cigarette smoking, I don’t want to fall into a chronic smoking habit, as I’m trying to be sober for the rest of my life. I’m young, and I shouldn’t be doing this bullshit. 

Does anyone know why all of a sudden I’ve been craving the cigarettes? Like is it some sort of psychological thing? I don’t know tbh my friend told me about “oral fixation” after quitting and I believe it might be this. I’ve been eating more and more too. 


TL:DR - smoked cigarettes a lot before, quit. Quit smoking weed last month and 3ish weeks ago, and now I’m craving cigarettes now. I want to know why after a year and some change the cigarette craving is back? Thank you in advance for the help.

Bf mad because I didn’t tell him about my slip up while quitting

I quit smoking a month ago. On July 1st I gave my usually charming boyfriend my 5 remaining cigs, told him to hide them/not let me smoke them. Fast forward a week later when I was under the influence. I took the cigs from the hiding spot and smoked 4 of them. I was so messed up I can hardly remember it. I left the box with one cig inside the shed. Here’s the important part; I didnt tell my boyfriend I’d slipped up. I continued to act like I had gone a week without cigarettes. Another week passes and I sneakily smoke the very last cigarette, my last one to date. I did not enjoy it. Fast forward to last night and my boyfriend looks in the hiding place and sees there are no cigarettes. He’s very upset because a) didn’t tell him I took the smokes, and b) i’ve been “lying” about my quit date. I guess my question is, can my quit date still be July 1, despite the 5 cigs, because I want it to? It’s more encouraging this way and I consider those 5 cigs to not have made much an impact considering I used to smoke almost a pack a day. I do feel bad for breaking a promise to my boyfriend and not telling him. I wish I had. What do you guys think? He says he can’t trust me...

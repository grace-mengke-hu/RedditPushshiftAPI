Started last night, the triggers are hard

As of 10:00 p.m. last night, EST time, I am done with smoking. Waking up this morning was really nice, my throat wasn't sore and my chest wasn't achy. But doing things that I normally have a smoke after, like eating, really make me crave one. 




I've been chewing gum every time I crave one, but does anyone have any other tips to get past the cravings?

need advice

so ive been quit now for over 2 months and i can honestly say its easy for me now, but tonight im going out drinking with the lads who all smoke. now this is gona be my biggest test, i know all the obvious things like tell yourself you dont want one etc, but all that goes out the window when youre drunk and yes i will definately get drunk, if and i repeat if i do be an idiot and smoke a cigarette am i going to wake up tomorow morning craving a cigarette like its day 1 again?

I'm drunk right now and really fucking want a cigarette

It's afternoon where I live and I'm already aware I have a drinking problem, which will be taken care of hopefully but this is not the sub for drinking problems. 

This said, everytime I drink I want a cigarette. They have in the past gone hand in hand for me like I'm sure they have for many others here. I can't help but want a cig. How should I combat this? What do I replace it with? Today I got my shoes on and went to walk to the store but instead I just walked around the block. I wish I could buy a single cigarette, it's all I want. Instead, I have to buy a pack, then be left with 19 others. It's devious. 

I shouldn't want this. Please I need help. I need to quit, I have too many health problems to be clogging up my lungs with sweet, sweet tobacco.

Any personal experiences with drinking and cigarettes welcome

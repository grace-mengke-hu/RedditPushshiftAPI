What is the point in asking how soon I smoke after I wake up?

I've noticed this question from going to the doctor, they always ask that question after asking how many smokes/day. Also the Smoke Free app asks that in the smoker information section. Is it just an indication of your addiction level or something? 

PS: This sub is awesome. I've tried to quit in the past, but after lurking this sub for a week I'm making another attempt and I feel really good about this run. Currently on day 5 and things are starting to get easier.

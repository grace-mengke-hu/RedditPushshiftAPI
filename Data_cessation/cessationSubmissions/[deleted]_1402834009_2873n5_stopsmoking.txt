Quit today. My 20th birthday.

Been on and off cigarettes for 4-5 years now.  Since living on my own I've been pretty heavy.  On and off but  never for good.  I know that the trick cigarettes play on us,  not Falling for it again.  Wish me luck everyone and I hope to encourage you all in your process as well.

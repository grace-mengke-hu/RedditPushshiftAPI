The last time I posted on here, I was on my fourth day without a cigarette. Today is 365 days.

Last time you guys heard from me I was struggling with quitting, but I knew deep down I wasn't going to give up. I needed to stay strong for myself, my health, my family, and my friends. Every one in my life was so supportive of my decision to quit, I didn't want to let them down and I especially didn't want to let myself down.
To catch you guys up on my thoughts from that time period, here is the link to my original post: https://redd.it/5m1q72

One year later, I am so fucking happy to tell you, I did it. I haven't touched a cigarette or even a tobacco/nicotine product.
No matter where you are in your stopsmoking journey, I promise you this, it gets easier. The first month is hell, the second month is slightly less hell, and by the third, fourth, and fifth month cigarettes will become something you used to love.

This doesn't mean the cravings go away entirely, there's been plenty of times in the last year that I've had a random craving. However, the cravings are so mild, it's easy to occupy my mind and let it pass. I can also say that in the last six months I've only had about two cravings. Like I promised, it gets easier. So no matter what day, week, or month you're on, hang in there and keep going. It's more than worth it.

vaping V E cigs Must watch

Watch the video carried out by Public Health England to show the differences. PHE &amp; NHS both state that no harm in passive vape and E-cigs 95% healthier, far more people quit with E-cigs than patches , gum other NRT. 

So surely can be used in doors if its not big cloudy vapers, genuine people wanting to quit don't want Mods, box mods, coils, VG,PG ohm etc etc . just a simple device.

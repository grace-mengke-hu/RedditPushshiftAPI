Back from a weekend with my chain smoking dad and still smoke free!

I thought this would be my undoing. I went to stay with my dad fro three days and he smokes like a chimney. I said to friends 'at least when I cave, I'll know I can make it this far'. 
Well... I didn't do it! I am still smoke free! I stuck to my guns and realised how good I feel within myself being able to breathe and having one less thing to worry about on top of the fact that I'm a little sick. 
I barely even craved. Together we can do it! This sub is the most incredible support and without you guys I couldn't do any of this :)

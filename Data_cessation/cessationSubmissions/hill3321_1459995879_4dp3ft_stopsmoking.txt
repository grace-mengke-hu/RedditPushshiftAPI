Third time's a charm! My 3rd go at quitting and I made it through Day 2!

I've smoked for 15 years. When I type 15 years, I can hardly believe I've let it go this long. I've tried quitting in the past. Lasted a few months, then started smoking just when having drinks, then back to smoking full time again. Always the same cycle. After being smoke-free for a few months I seem to forget how much of a struggle it is to quit and have a drag here and there from friends' cigarettes, and then in a few months I'm back to buying my own smokes again. I forget how terrible the first week of quitting is. The intense cravings, the mood swings, how slow time seems to pass... This time I won't forget. I've written a list of reasons why I've quit and posted it on my fridge. I've started a quit diary and documented the past couple of days. I plan to read the reason list and the diary often so that I don't forget how hard this is again! I am really excited, but really scared at the same time. It's hard to be confident that you will stay quit, when you've failed in the past. Each time thinking it was going to be your last. I wish quitting came with a guarantee!

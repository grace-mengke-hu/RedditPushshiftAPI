90 day celebration and a thank you...

Well, I didn't think I'd get to this point. While I know that a big part of quitting is willpower and finding the strength to say "No", it's equally as important (if not moreso) to have a group or circle that you can rely on for advice and support. I haven't said an awful lot here but I visit every day to feel inspired and secure in my decision to give up smoking and live a more healthy life.

So to all of you, whether you're just starting your journey, years free or somewhere in the middle, thank you for your stories, words and just for being here. You all rock!

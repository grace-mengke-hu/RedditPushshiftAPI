3 days #notevenone

Just starting out but I hear the first three days are the toughest. I found that as long as I just don't stop at the store, no matter how many or how strong cravings were it was easy to say to myself "too bad, you don't have any no matter how much you want one". The other thing I have found to help get over each craving has been to just stay busy! Easy enough since I have been rebuilding an old Jeep. But even when I'm not doing that and a craving hits, I try to occupy my hands and mind with something g else asap. My energy levels are up and it is driving my motivation. The longer I go without a smoke, the more self-control and self-discipline I find within myself. If I can make it this far anyone can. Find your reason to quit!

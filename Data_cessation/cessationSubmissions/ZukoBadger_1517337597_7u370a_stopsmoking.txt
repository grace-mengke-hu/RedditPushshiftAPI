I’m going to quit today

I’ve never smoked cigarettes, but I’ve smoked the majorly hated Vuse Vibe for about a year now. I go through a pack of 2 tanks in about 3-4 days. 

This morning, I put on my second tank, and it tastes like shit. Burnt. 

I’m pissed off. I’m not going to be able to get another pack until Friday. 

Then I get a brilliant thought. I should quit! 

So here I am, 1 hour from my last puff, attempting to quit cold turkey. Hopefully this works. I think the hardest part will be breaking the routine of, well, doing it constantly. 

Any advice is gladly excepted. Will post updates if you guys want. 

Update 1: It’s been about 6 hours. There is a terrible pit in my stomach and I feel weird af. 

Update 2: 10 hours in. The internet talks of getting cravings every once in awhile. I have had a constant craving since hour 4. Wot.

I just threw my tobacco away and cut my ID in half...

(For context, being a short, fairly androgynous girl with short hair, I look too much like a teenage boy to buy anything without ID. Last month I got carded for a Captain America DVD). 

I keep "quitting" then breaking, and I'm going to force myself into it this time. I'm an ex-addict, and I got through proper drug withdrawal, so I don't see why I can't get through this. Wish me luck!

Second time Lucky?

Ok so this is my second attempt at quitting. Last time I quit for 9 months then stupidly went back to it for no apparent reason. So I am now attempting again with the help of Vaping. Gradually dropping the amount of Nicotine in my Vape. Any body else do it this way? It worked last time for me for 9 months. Just hope it will this time. Not had a fag since 2nd October at 8.00am.

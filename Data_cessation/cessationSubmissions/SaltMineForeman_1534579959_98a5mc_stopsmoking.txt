6ish packs the last year vs 6ish packs a week...

I've had a LOT of people messaging me about telling Steve to fuck off next month.

I still light up sometimes when I'm drunk but haven't gone back to the habit of smoking all the time... and that's basically what I respond with. 

I don't work with Steve anymore and I haven't gone a year since having a cigarette... I'm still going to call this decent progress and want to get him a cookie with a note or something.

Thoughts?

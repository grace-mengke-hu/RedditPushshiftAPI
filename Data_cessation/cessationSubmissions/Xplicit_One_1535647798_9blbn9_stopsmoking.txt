3 days of not smoking.

I have been smoking since October 2017 and I know it isn't a long time but I decided its not something I want in my life bc of the health issues and I felt like crap. I haven't smoked in 3 days. The chest pains are gone now. My throat feels dry/scratchy but I can deal with it. I feel a lot better already. I can't imagine trying to stop for those that smoked a lot longer than I have.

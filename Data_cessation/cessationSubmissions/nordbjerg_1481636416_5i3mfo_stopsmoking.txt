Now is the time

I'm quitting. I've become aware of how dangerous it is. It hit me because one of my friends had to have surgery in one of her lungs to remove a cyst. They said the likely cause was her smoking. She's turning 20.

I'm 20 myself, and I've smoked for roughly 2,5 years. I don't know why I started, and I wish I never did. I've had a few times where I didn't smoke for a week or so, and it hit me that I could smell things I've forgotten had smells. Freshly cut grass, wet roads after summer rain. I miss it.

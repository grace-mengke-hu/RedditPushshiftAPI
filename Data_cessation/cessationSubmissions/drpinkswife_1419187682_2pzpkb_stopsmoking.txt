Just noticed

It's been six months without nicotine. Best decision ever. And if I can do it, you can do it. It wasn't the physical addiction that would have done me in, but the emotional aspects of smoking. So if you think you can't quit because you get something emotionally from smoking...you can quit and it does get better. I promise.

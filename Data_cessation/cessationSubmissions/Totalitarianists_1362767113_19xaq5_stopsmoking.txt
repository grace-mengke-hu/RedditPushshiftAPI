100 days snuck up on me, feels so good!

I put my foot down 100 days ago today, never looked back.  I finally found enough reasons to quit and now I'm feeling stronger, healthier and happier than I have in years!  I went on my first long bike ride since quitting yesterday and I am amazed at how much easier it is since getting off the junk.  So happy!  Fuck cigarettes.

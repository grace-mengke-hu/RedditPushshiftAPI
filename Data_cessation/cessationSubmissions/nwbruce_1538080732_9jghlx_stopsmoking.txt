70 days, but I'm in a funk; when do I start feeling better or find some motivation?

I thought this was supposed to be some fresh start, but I can't seem to get up the energy to go get a job, haven't showered in days, can't even seem to get up to go enjoy the last sunny days of summer.... Cigarettes used to be my excuse to get out there and do stuff, but now it seems like nothing is to be done.

I can't believe that I made it this far. I am so happy.

I smoked off and on between the ages of 18 and 27.  There was a point where I was smoking more heavily between 23 and 26 (1 to 2 packs of Marb/Newport 100s a day *Non Menthol*).  During that part of my life I honestly couldn't even imagine myself as a non-smoker.  Not even a small piece of me could grasp the concept of wanting to quit.  It was June of last year that I started to snap out of a depression that seemed to follow me through life.  I honestly can't even say what happened... Something inside of myself just said that I should definitely give up smoking any kind of tobacco.  No Hookah, no cigars, and especially no cigarettes.  As sudden as the day I started smoking I was able to stop smoking.  I no longer saw the point.  I've made it over a year without even taking a puff.  From a cold turkey spontaneous decision I was able to do something I never thought I'd do.  I am happy, I am debt free (besides a mortgage), I am smoke free, I can sing, my teeth look a lot better than they did a year ago... I just feel blessed.  I started reading this subreddit before I quit smoking and I definitely think that it has also had an impact on my ability to stay strong.  I used to need a cigarette, now I don't even want one.

Will the feeling of "missing out" ever go away?

First of all, let me say that I am really proud of how far I've come (149 days!) and I know that all of my reasons for quitting are valid and far outweigh any "pros" I may delude myself into considering. 

That being said, man I just hate the feeling that I'm not having as much fun when I'm not smoking. For the past 14 years I've been a "drinking smoker", and predominately only when I was around other smokers. If I was sober, or if I was alone, the chances were very slim that I'd smoke. I feel grateful that my only triggers revolve around drinking. That being said, I am around those triggers quite a bit (especially because my husband still smokes). I can go weeks without craving a cigarette, but the second I am drinking around other smokers I feel like I'm missing out. I know it's all psychological, but I'd love to hear from some more long-term quitters about whether this feeling goes away.

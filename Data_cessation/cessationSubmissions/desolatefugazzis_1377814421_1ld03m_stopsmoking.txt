Give me ALL the good reasons to quit!

Hey guys, 

I was a subscriber here a year or so ago when I first had the thought of quitting. I'm 24, been smoking since I was 17, and the other day I noticed that I am AGING. I am ACTUALLY aging faster than I should, because of 8 years of this stupid, stupid habit. 

So, I want to quit. Again. I want to do it right this time. Please, for the love of all things, tell me all the reasons that quitting is good. I  am sure I have heard it all before, but hearing it again right now would be terribly beneficial. Enlighten me?

Thanks in advance.

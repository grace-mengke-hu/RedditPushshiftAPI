NICOTINE FREE for 1 year and 4 hmonths

NICOTINE FREE for 1 year and 4 hmonths..... i've noticed that i gained weight which is really my goal.. bcoz before when i was smoking, my appetite is not that huge, but now my taste and my appetite really increased. b4 every month i have cough and cold....but i noticed after my 6 months quit smoking until now... i dont have or even get sick...

i would say that quitting smoking is one of my achievements in life. and if you love your family and want to be with them for a long long time.... stop smoking, be healthy , be strong.... and always pray and ask for guidance to GOD...

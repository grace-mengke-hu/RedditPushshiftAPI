Made it to a week! Many thanks to this subreddit for support

Hey all you quitters! 29 year old here.  Been smoking a pack a day since I was 18.  Marlboro 27's and Marlboro lights.  Quit cold turkey a week ago and barely started getting over the withdrawal symptoms.  What were my withdrawal symptoms you ask? I acted like an irrational baby rager hit by a wave of lethargy and mild lingering headaches throughout the day  LOL.  Shit was not fun at all, but I'm seeing the light at the end of the tunnel! Been walking 2+ miles a day which helps immensely.  I'm kind of eating like I just smoked weed for my first time and just got hit by the munchie monster.  I have this voracious appetite and everything tastes and smells so god damn good!  



Anyways, just want to thank the subreddit and everyone here for supporting each other and sharing your stories. It's heartening to see that other people are suffering with me LOL. ;D

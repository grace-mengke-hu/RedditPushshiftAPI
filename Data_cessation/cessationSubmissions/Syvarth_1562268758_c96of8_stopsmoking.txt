In need of some help

As the title said, I need some help. First, some back story: I have been smoke free for 2 years. Quitting was awful, and my girlfriend did not join me in quitting, which made it even harder for me. I struggled with it alone, and got no support. My girlfriend insists it was ‘so easy’ for me because I only had a few setbacks before quitting for good. 
In January of this year, she decided she would quit. Part of the reason for it is that she has severe Asthma, and smoking makes her very sick sometimes. It was hard for her, but I tried being helpful and supportive of her. By the end of February she was completely done. No cigarettes, no vape. I was so proud of her. 

This brings us to two weeks ago. She had borrowed my headphones, so I went into her purse to get them back (which is something we do all the time). I didn’t find my headphones, but I did find a pack of cigarettes with a few missing. After being pretty upset about it at work, I decided to talk to her about it when I got home. She told me it was an impulse buy when she was drunk and that I should just drop it. I asked her point blank if she was smoking again, and she said no. 
Since then she has gone on walks alone, coming home smelling of smoke. I can always tell when she goes out for one because she covers it heavily with perfume or immediately smokes some weed to cover her breath up. 

What do I do? I’m so upset by all of this. It’s hard living with a smoker again, I can smell it on her clothes and on her hair. I don’t want to ambush her with this, but I also don’t want to be lied to anymore. 

Has anyone dealt with something like this before? I don’t even know how to bring it up with her.

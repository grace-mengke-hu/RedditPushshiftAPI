Restoring Lung Health

Hello! I am currently wanting to quit smoking. I’m going to give you some background/info so you guys can understand me better and hopefully provide some support too. Sorry it’s long.

I have quit several times and have made it around a year without smoking. I have had troubles with alcohol and I ALWAYS smoked when I drank. I had relapsed around the holidays this past season  (after 5 months of not smoking), and I picked it back up.  I wanted to wait to have some concrete sobriety time under my belt before quitting smoking again, to ensure I wouldn’t get too stressed and relapse on everything. 

I am a little over 4 months sober now, I am starting up some weight loss activities, running in events, I am starting to do well in my life in general, I just turned 29 and my goal is to be in great health once I turn 30 - and maintain it. 

I ran 5K tonight and my lungs hurt, and I want to quit really bad. I’ve done cold turkey in the past and running has always helped me quit, but I bought some patches to help me through it. I have a patch on my nightstand for the morning and I REALLY hope I can do it.

My main question is how do I restore my lungs to health? Is there anything that will make running/breathing easier? Are there any deep lung cleansing remedies anyone has found helpful?

Also, what are the best smoking cessation apps? and any pro-tips for quitting is really appreciated.

I am grateful for any insight, information and support. I’m not sure if there’s such a thing as being “ready” to quit, but I can say I really want it. Hope everyone is doing well. Thank you so much for reading this long ass post.

TLDR; looking for restorative lung health products/activities, general support and things that help (like apps) for accountability and more.

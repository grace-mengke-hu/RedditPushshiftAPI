I put my last cigarette out on my hand

First off - Don't do this. Don't put a cigarette out on your hand. It was just something I knew I personally needed to do and I just want to write about it.

I'm 21 and I've been smoking about a pack every 2 days since I was 17. I've made a few attempts at quitting, once I even quit for like 2 months, but I eventually relapsed when stress started to surmount. I've probably made about 5-6 honest attempts at quitting, but they've all failed for one reason or another, and I'm sure all of you can empathize with that. 

Today though, I was at the end of my pack (Marlboro Reds) and one of the cigarettes sitting in there was one of the new Marlboro Edge cigs. I started casually smoking it, but suddenly this feeling came over me, and I knew I had to do this, if I ever wanted to really quit, I had to put this cigarette out on the back of my hand. It hurt, but I did it, and sanitized it afterwards. Honestly, I hope it scars. I hope every time I look at my hand I can see a little rough circle, and it will remind me of the damage that cigarettes do to you. I really do feel empowered, like I reached a new level of inner peace and zen, and plus I know in the future this will make a great story of how I quit smoking. I've never felt so sure of something before.

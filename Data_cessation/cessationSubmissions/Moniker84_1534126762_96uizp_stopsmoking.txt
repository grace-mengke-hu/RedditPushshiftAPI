Another month has come and gone..

It's insane to think that for 10 months now I have been completely nicotine free. I am happier, healthier and have more money than I used to. My clothes smell good all the time &amp; that dreadful feeling of wondering if I smell like an ashtray in a small space is completely gone.

Before I never thought I'd be here, but now I couldn't imagine going back. 

Once I get to the Year mark it will be time to get these extra pounds non smoking has put on me under control. lol. Other than that though, everything that's happened since I quit has been a total improvement!

Day 2, mothafucking MOOD SWINGS.

Made it to day two, which is quite amazing, really. Previous attempts failed after day one, haha. And now I remember why. I wrote that I was just waiting for all hell to break loose and well... it kind of did towards the evening. I had weird ass dreams and slept restlessly. I was sooo tired yesterday. Today I've felt like I want to do *everything*. I want to run around and do stuff! And these mood swings man... One minute I'm feeling like Wonder Woman, invincible and strong. The next I just want to curl up in a corner and cry. The next I'm angry at everyone/everything. I feel like a teenager again. Have had some minor anxiety as well, but only for short periods at a time. Anyway, I know I'm not making much sense right now, haha. There are positive effects though! For example, MRW I'm starting to smell *everything* and food has so much taste: http://media.giphy.com/media/SOYBR16wVV0di/giphy.gif
I mean, who knew? I'd completely forgotten.

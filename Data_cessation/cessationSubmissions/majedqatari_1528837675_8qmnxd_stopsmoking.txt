I am going crazy

Been a smoker since 2009, 5 days ago i decided to quit smoking with the help of nicotine patches. Everything was fine for three days till i found out that i was allergic to nicotine patches. I decided to stop using any NRT and just be patient for few days. 

As far as i can tell, nicotine is not my problem now. Im just used to smoke when i wake up, eat, walk, play video games, bored, studying, reading, watching tv ... 

I just cant stop thinking about smoking when doing any of above, i am losing my mind.

Please someone tell me this is normal :(

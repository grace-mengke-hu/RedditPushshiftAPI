8 days today

I am on day number 8. I smoked for 32 years and found the nicotine patch is a huge tool for me so far. I've never made it more than 1 day before. My doctor has me on a 6 week plan that steps me down to the lower dose patches and then no patch at the 6 week mark. Have anyone tried the patch and how did it go?

Thanks -

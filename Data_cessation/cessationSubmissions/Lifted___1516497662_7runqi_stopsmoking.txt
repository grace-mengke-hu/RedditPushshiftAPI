Alternative way to quit

I have been a long time lurker here, but I figured I'd share the  way I quit with you guys.  I've "quit" more times than I can count in my life, just like many of you. But the way that I finally kicked it may seem a little counterintuitive at first but hear me out. 

This time I kept my pack and my lighter on me wherever I went, just like usual. The key is to not think about quitting as giving something up. If you tell a kid they can't have something, it only makes them want it more. Same goes for smokers. It was easier for me to quit by having my pack close by than just getting rid of my smokes and telling myself I can't have it. 

Let me know what you guys think and post your weird ways of quitting

Joining the gang, NOW

Hello world!
 I’ve been a smoker since I was 10 (bad neighborhood) ,am now 20. Tried to quit multiple times before but failed. Yesterday, I stayed up all night and haven’t smoked, felt really good and interesting. It felt nice to want, and have the motivation to do other things than smoking every hour. I think it boosted my creative powers. But I fell to my girlfriend’s invite to smoke in the morning. Will update this post about my cravings and thoughts. No more smoking. Going Cold Turkey, no social smoking, or just one more. I quit. Peace.

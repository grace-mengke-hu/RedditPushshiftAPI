Today's the day!

Firstly,  thanks to all on this sub - Its been inspiring to read through the great advice and success stories.  So after 5 or so lame attempts to stop (over the last 15 years ) I decided on trying the Champix route (Chantix in the US).  Smoked for 26 years - pack a day.  Tried Patches , Zyban (bupropion) and pathetic cold turkey attempts.  the side effects of Champix have been minimal and after 14 days on the drug it feels like the right time to stop. So putting it out there - today is the fist day of a nicotone free future!

Champix/ Chantix

Same drug different countries. Does anyone else feel lit right up on this stuff? Seriously it gives me ridiculous clarity. I feel I accomplish amazing things on it! I don't feel at all high, or strange in that sense. But I totally feel like my receptors are lit right up and my synapses are on point. I sort of feel like the energizer bunny. Anyone else? Is this normal?

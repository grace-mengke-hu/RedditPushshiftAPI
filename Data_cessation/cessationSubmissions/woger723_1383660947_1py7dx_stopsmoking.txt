Money Saved by Not Smoking Question

Hi Everyone,
  I'd like to calculate how much money I've saved by not smoking for the last 41 days. Are there any websites you would recommend for this? I've seen a lot of sites after doing a google search, but found they just told me how much I'd save in a year, etc.

I'm on day 6!

Hey all, 
Well this has been a long day coming...and so far 6 days without smoking! My reason, I need to get healthy and I smoked about a pack a day for probably 9yrs (I'm 29) and I would use smoking as a vice when I would become stressed or didn't know how to handle the situation. I recently gotten broken up with and instead of falling, I decided to climb. I have taken multiple challenges and I'm getting better. I'm 100 days alcohol free, slowed my intake of sugar and mainly drink water and unsweetened tea. I am working on eating more greens. 

Man, it's tough at times....but I keep myself busy now and bought two books to work on me. Keep in there all!!!!

Day 4 and a big test this week end.

I'm halfway through day 4. It's been ok so far, not easy, but manageable. The big test will be this week end where I play golf like I do most Saturdays. That's always been a moment during which I smoked a lot. 

One the one hand I'm a bit wary about it, on the other I'm eager to just get through the day and show myself I can go out there, play some golf, not smoke and enjoy myself..

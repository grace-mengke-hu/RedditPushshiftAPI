Wondering about the general consensus on vaping

Hey guys! I was a smoker for about 6 years, but i got fed up with all the bullshit that comes along with it. My friend recently got a new box mod and is letting me try out his old stingray to see if i want to buy it. I've had it since saturday and haven't wanted a cig since. I feel more energized, i don't feel like death in the morning, i'm not running out of breath going up the stairs, all this after 5 days of no smoking, it's amazing!

So i guess the question is, if i stick with this, can i consider myself a "non-smoker"? Do you guys think it's a viable way to quit? I appreciate any input on the matter, and thank you!

Time to stop

This is my first post to reddit. I've been lurking for almost a year and finally got up the nerve to participate.

I've been smoking off and on for the lats four years. A lot of people would consider me barely a smoker. Most days I'll only have one or two, but I go a lot of days without having any. I started out social smoking, but lately I've had the urge to smoke everyday before work and before school (I work and go to college full time). I really don't think I will be able to stop myself from having a cigarette while I am around my buddies who smoke. I mostly want to start by not smoking while I am alone in my car. It seems like a lot of the urge is boredom a lot of times. I think it's the hardest to stop when exams roll around. I'm willing to take any suggestions on stopping. This will be day two of not smoking, which isn't an accomplishment yet, but I have to start somewhere.

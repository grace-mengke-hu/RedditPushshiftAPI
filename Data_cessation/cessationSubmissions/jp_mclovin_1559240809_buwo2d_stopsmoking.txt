I failed. Simple as that.

It's been a long time since I've been here.  Mostly out of shame, partially because I wasn't doing anything to correct my mistake.

I quit for ~1.5 years. About 6 months ago, with out any stressful situations or big life changing events, I  bought a pack of smokes.  I still can't figure out what drove me to do so and it has cost me so much progress. 


 Today, I am rejoining this community to say I am once again a non-smoker!  I just had a tooth pulled and it was embarrassing to have to say I was a smoker again after my very successful quot period. Today, I start my journey anew.  I'm sorry I let myself down, but here's to "not one more, ever!"

Thanks for reading, good luck to all of you. I hope anyone struggling cab see just how easy it is to slip, and that slope is steep.

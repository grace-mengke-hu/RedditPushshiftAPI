I smoke about a pack a day/day and a half and its cutting into my finances and personal life

The title says it all basically. I'm routine with my smoking: 1 before work, 1 at each break (10:30am & 4:30pm), and three on my lunch (12:30, 12:40, 12:50pm). When I get home around 5:30pm, I usually am finishing one from the drive home while listening to A7X (8-27-13!!!). 

Anyways, it is starting to take its toll in my personal life as well. My girlfriend and I get a long great, but she is an ex-smoker. She knows I would like to quit(I have twice, for 3 months at a time, I'm 6 months relapse as of now), but lack the motivation or strength sometimes. She says it doesn't bother her, which I know it does at least a little, it is kind of nasty to be honest.

I was just curious if anyone here had a little feedback for a nicofiend. 

TL;DR: Read title.

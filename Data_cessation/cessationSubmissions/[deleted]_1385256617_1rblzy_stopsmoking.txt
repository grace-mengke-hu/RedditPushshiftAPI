24 hours smoke free.

GAHHHHH!!!!!! 

I am trying to so hard to keep my mind off smoking. I feel like my thought process right now is "I want a cigarette. I should go for a walk. I want a cigarette. I need to stop thinking about smoking cigarettes. I'm hungry... but then I know I will want a cigarette. Cigarette. Cigarette. Cigarette."

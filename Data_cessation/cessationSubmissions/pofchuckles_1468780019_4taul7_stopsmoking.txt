Day 41 today I got hammered on day 39

Went out to a friends birthday a big group of around 20 of us. In the bar where I spent most of my Tuesday nights and Friday's during winter season at the ski resort where I work. Despite being very drunk for the first time in months and being drunk has always been the reason I failed after 5 days usually in the past i'm delighted to announce I didn't smoke. Not only did I not smoke but after my friend walked into the bat after one I thought "Wow he smells did I do this for 9 years? Everytime I kissed a girl it must of been some achievment" Because it's not nice at all

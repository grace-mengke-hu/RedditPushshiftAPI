250 Days!

I can hardly believe it but it has been 250 days since I smoked a cigarette.  I used the patch and lozenges for the first two months then nothing, and I have not cheated once.  Not one puff.  The urge is still there--sometimes I'll see one on the ground and a part of my brain wants to lunge for it and smoke--but now I feel confident in saying that I am a non-smoker and it makes me happy.

Tomorrow is the day UPDATE

Day One and Two Complete. On Day Three. 

Going cold turkey has been surprisingly okay. I have cravings sure, but every time I do I drink water, eat a snack, take a deep breathe, and or go for a walk and it passes. Honestly I think being in the right head space has really helped me. I was worried it would be much more painful and it hasn't been. I've had StopSmoking Reddit support, friends family and coworker support, Smoke Free app, food, gum, deep breathes, walks, and water.  But I think what it really was: after ten years of smoking- I was sick of it. Tired of being a slave to cigarettes. I chose my quit date. Prepared for it. Stayed as positive as I could. And it's been okay! 

I hope it remains that way. Because I'm not going back. I am no longer a smoker. But one day at a time, here goes Day 3!

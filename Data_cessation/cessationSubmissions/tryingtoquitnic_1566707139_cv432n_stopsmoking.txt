quitting vaping

I dont know if this sub is for nicotine in general or just smoking so let me know if im posting in the wrong place.

I quit vaping out of necessity, money is tight and I lost my vape.  Couldnt afford a new one.  I started the first few days with gum and then nothing.  Had some pretty bad mood swings and anxiety.  It was not fun.

ANyways, found my vape in my trunk.  Shit.   I started again for the past day and a half.  I guess I'm not sure how to quit if its around.  I hadnt really wanted to quit but I didnt have the money.  Now Im starting to want to quit for me.  I could use some advise.

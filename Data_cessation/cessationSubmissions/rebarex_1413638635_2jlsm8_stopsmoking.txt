Resisted a drunk smoke.. Feeling great!

Day 10 and it's been tough, but I haven't had to face any drunk cravings until last night. I came back from the bar and wanted a smoke soo bad. Just one, I told myself! I was so close to walking down the road to buying a pack (to have "just one" how stupid!) but then I opened the quit app on my phone and reminded myself that I've made a lot of progress and I shouldn't throw it away. Had to remind myself that I DONT want to be a smoker... Period. So I went to bed and woke up this morning so ecstatic that I didn't give in! Feels so great.

For all those quitters who may indulge in alcohol this weekend -- stay strong and keep it up!

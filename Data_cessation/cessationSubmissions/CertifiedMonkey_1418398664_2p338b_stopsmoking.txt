Hi r/stopsmoking, i need your help with my mom

Hey everyone, i know this is a subreddit for self improvement of the people who come here, but i'm just not sure where else to go. I just need some advice to help my mom quit smoking. To give a little backstory, she has been smoking since she was 14, she is 49 now and will be reaching 50 next year. In 2012, she quit smoking, it was a slow progress, but she did it, the whole family was  very proud of her. Unfortunately, this brought her more stress into her life, she gained weight, and it was difficult for her but we were here for her as a family. Recently she has started smoking again, and going back to her old habits. She only started with a few, but now im seeing her smoke a pack a day. This started about 3 months ago, and im really starting to get worried about her health. She did such a great job quitting but i hate seeing her relapse into this bad habit again, and i just feel helpless on the sidelines, i dont know what to do. I have confronted her about it, other family members have, but i feel all that did was make it worse. 

Some friends have recommended something like and E-cig to help, but im really just lost at the moment, i would appreciate any advice at all.

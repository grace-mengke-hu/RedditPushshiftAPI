Weird Weekend

So I've been 10 days off cigarettes, was vaping exclusively for the 1st 8 days while I dialled down my nicotine intake. Now I'm 48hrs clear of nicotine.

My withdrawl so far hasn't been as bad as I expected. The nicotine goblins have been griping in my head a little but not so much that I can't ignore it (weaning myself off nicotine by vaping did it's job). However, I'm having some symptoms that may or may not be related so I'm after some opinions.

I have felt like shit all weekend. It's a feeling of lethargy and ever so slight nausea that I have had before so I'm not sure it's related (I've put it down to being tired before). I've also felt restless all weekend. I've also been taking naps which I very rarely do. These feelings are happening all at once. Is this withdrawl related or did I really want a lazy weekend while my body didn't?

Opinions please.

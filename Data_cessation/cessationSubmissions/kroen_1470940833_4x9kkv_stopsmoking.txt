Day 4. Started getting nausea. Which might just break me.

You have to understand something: I have emetophobia which means puking is probably the worst thing I could possibly experience. Even nausea gives me panic attacks given it's strong enough. Now I just started getting light nausea, but if it gets stronger and/or persists for more than a day I don't see how I could stop myself from smoking. I'm not joking when I say I'd rather die of lung cancer 20 years from now than puke once. Yeah, I know it doesn't make sense, but phobias rarely do. Anyway, should I be worried?

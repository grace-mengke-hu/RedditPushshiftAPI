1 year! I know there were other April fools quitters, did you guys make it?!

Made it to a year, after a 10 year habit.  I never thought I'd actually quit, I just fantasized about it for a long time. That very first moment you decide to quit, and actually refuse a cigarette when your first craving hits, is the hardest part. Trust me, it gets so much easier! I encourage anyone considering quitting, to finally take the plunge. There's no better time then now!

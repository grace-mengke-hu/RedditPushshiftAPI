Been over a month since I smoked. Big test coming up!

Been smoke free for over a month.  Got a ski/party trip coming up Sunday and into next week with my old college buds.  Fortunately none of them smoke, so I should be OK, but this will be my first test in a party atmosphere with copious amounts of alcohol.  Wish me luck!

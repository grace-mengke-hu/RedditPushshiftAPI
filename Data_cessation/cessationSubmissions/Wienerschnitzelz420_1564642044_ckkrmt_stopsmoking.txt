I love how I got a bit annoyed at smokers in the club last night

Went to the club last night and was surrounded by people chain smoking while being drunk asf. It actually started to annoy me. I'm now one of those guys that just walks away from wherever people are smoking. It's hypocritical because I must have annoyed other people by doing this myself, but it also shows how I'm never going to smoke again.

F 47, smoked 30 years and want to quit for good. Any helpful apps or tips.

I think the smoking is taking a toll on my health and I need to let it go.  It is really hard though, kind of like giving up my best friend.  I am the only smoker in my house now (hubby quit 6 months ago), but he is a person who just sets his mind to something and does it...I on the other hand am pretty stubborn, and set in my ways.

I know there has to be hope for me. I don't want to take medicine like chantix though.

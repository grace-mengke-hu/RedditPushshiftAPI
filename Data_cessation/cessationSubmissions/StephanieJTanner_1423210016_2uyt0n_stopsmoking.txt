No more hypertension!

So today was my fifth smoke-free day. (I'm using nicotine gum about 4-5 times a day and vape occasionally.) My blood pressure had been through the roof for years, and I stopped taking my medication a few months ago because of some adverse side effects. I started exercising regularly about three weeks ago to try to lower my BP, and it helped, but it was still a bit high, at pre-hypertension levels. Getting it down to a healthy level was part of my reason for quitting smoking.

I finally made it to see my doctor yesterday to confess that I had been bad and stopped my medication, and to see about getting something else for it. But after looking at my chart, the first thing she said was, "Your blood pressure is beautiful!" I told her I had quit my medication, but have been working out and was quitting smoking, and she told me I no longer needed to take anything for my blood pressure! I'm healthy! And it will only get better once I'm 100% nicotine free. Feeling awesome and motivated as ever!

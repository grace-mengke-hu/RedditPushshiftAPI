I'm not special

A year and 5 months ago I quit. My friends still smoked, my fiance still smoked, and no one in my family suddenly died from prolonged tobacco use. I just decided it was time. And by that I mean it was the 3rd time I decided it was time. But this time I think it's for good. Guys (and gals)....dont give up. You got this.

Cold Turkey: Day 7. Recapping week 1.

It's been a week since my last cigarette. I woke up this morning with my muscles sore and my whole body in pain to the point where I could barely move. This has nothing to do with any nicotine withdrawals or cravings though. This is because after being smoke free for a week I feel like I have the energy to do more and to keep bettering myself. So after a very intensive workout at the gym yesterday I feel that "good pain" that comes after a vigorous workout when you're getting back into shape. 


 So yes the first few days of quitting smoking all you can think about is  battling the cravings and all you can think about is NOT lighting up. It's exhausting but it's not impossible. These urges though frequent at first only last for 2 or 3 minutes at a time so just don't show weakness for those few minutes. Then the next thing I noticed is that I ate A LOT. Smoking suppresses the appetite so after giving it up I constantly felt like eating. It's probably partly due to that fact and also due to the facts that you get your full sense of smell and taste back and food is certainly much much more enjoyable. So needless to say. I did gain 7 lbs in 7 days but it's no big deal. The health benefits far outweigh the extra pounds. And also this comes back full circle to give me more motivation to keep working out and to make smarter dietary choices. 


So my point is that what started off as a mission to quit smoking has evolved into a full scale "bettering myself" campaign. I intend to keep riding this wave of self confidence and determination as far as it will take me.

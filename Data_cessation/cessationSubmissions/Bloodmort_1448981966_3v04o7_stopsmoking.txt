I'm stopping this New Years. Please give me tips.

Hey guys,

I've been smoking for nearly 5 years now and I've decided that on New Years (as cliche as it is) I will be stopping smoking. 

I usually smoke a pack of 20 Rothman's a day (UK). I'm not a fan of patches and gum, as I've tried these before. Do you have any other methods that will help me stop? I tried stopping earlier this year and managed two months before I stupidly started again.

Any help is appreciated! Thank you.

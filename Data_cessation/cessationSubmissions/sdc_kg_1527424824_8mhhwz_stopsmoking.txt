Smokers, ex-Smokers I apologize for the following... (rant) ...you know what, just don't read it.

I'm on day three of not smoking, with the help of lozenges and of course, you guys.  I'm also on day three of not drinking with the help of LaCroix, AA, and of course the gang over on r/stopdrinking.  Carbless for a month and a half thanks to the gang on r/keto.  Game-free thanks to the gang over on r/stopgaming.  I love all of you guys.

*That* being said... (turn back now)
I took advantage of my sobriety, woke up clear-eyed and before dawn to go for a walk down the local museum-park-richpeople'salley system.  Every time I take that route, I always spot some litter, and vow to bring a trash bag with me the next time, but never have.

Well, this time I remembered!  So I brought my trash bag, with a mind to grab whatever garbage I spot along my walk.

(turn back now...there's going to be salty language)

Smokers.  We have got to talk.  WHAT the FUCK is with all the garbage??  Butts EVERYWHERE.  Rain drenched empty packs of smokes.  Those little plastic ends of cheaply-arsed (bot avoidance) cigars.  Wrappers.  I thought I was going out for soda cans and water bottles, but 90% of *at least* is smoker garbage.  I've got a healthy loathing for the human species on a *good* day, THAT was almost enough to send me straight to Hermitsville!  Holy crap!

Gods, it was a mistake.  A terrible mistake.  Eyes-front, don't look down, and you'll be a lot happier.  The world will end with us all drowning in cigarette butts, but just block it out of your mind.

*GHAH!*

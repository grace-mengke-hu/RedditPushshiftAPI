Should I avoid happy hour or should I man up and attempt to break the association between drinking and smoking?

I am 11 days into a cold turkey quit. I've had a beer here and there, no big deal, not any crazy cravings. I went to the bar last weekend and was lucky enough to have my girlfriend there to stop me from wanting to go outside with the smokers and sneak one. It was a mild struggle, but not too bad. I'm supposed to go out for happy hour tonight, and already all I'm thinking about is the struggle not to smoke. So what I'm curious to know is what you all think is the best thing to do.  

A) Shy away from the bar scene until a time comes that I'm more confident (if that ever happens since my addiction is so closely tied to going out for a few beers.) to tackle this?

B) Soldier on and start re-training my brain to disassociate drinking and smoking right away? In other words, the earlier I can break the association the better?



What say you?

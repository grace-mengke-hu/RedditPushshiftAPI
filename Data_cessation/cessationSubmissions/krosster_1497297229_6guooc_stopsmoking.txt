Dumb brain tricks

In 7 minutes it will be 100 hours without a cigarette but I WANT ONE. 
Bought chocolate today because my tummy is starting to hurt from all the hard candy. Bleh. I may have to turn to other methods. 
I've been doing a very small workout every morning to give myself something to do and it is nice. 
I'm frustrated because I feel discouraged with quitting, like I'm missing out. I know it's not true but I miss smoking. Eeek. 
I'm reading stories about people relapsing who are way ahead of me in days and it makes me nervous. 
Hasn't even been a week and I almost convinced myself to have one. 
I really want to quit. I have quit. I am done. 
Just withdrawing I suppose. My brain is trying to trick me ):

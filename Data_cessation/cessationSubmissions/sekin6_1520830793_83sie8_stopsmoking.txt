Champix

Sooo I’m day 9 off the smokes with the help of champix. Up until this point, I haven’t minded so much the ongoing nausea and vomiting as I felt it was worth it to get off the smokes. I haven’t had any cravings when taking the champix as prescribed (2x 1mg/day). It also makes me soooo tired. I skipped one dose the other day and the cravings were back in full force, it was a very uncomfortable time. 

Today I am feeling overwhelmed about the whole thing. I am tired of feeling sick and nauseous and feel like as soon as I stop taking champix, it’s gunna feel like I’m quitting cold turkey and the cravings will be unbearable...

Wish I was already at the milestones that you guys are after reading some of your posts! 

PS I take the champix with food and a drink. Also tried taking champix in the middle of a meal

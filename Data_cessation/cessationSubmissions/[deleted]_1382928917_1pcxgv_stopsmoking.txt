I read all of your posts while smoking. I need help. I want help. I can't stop.

I just spent over $1,000 in testing, because my throat is swollen. I can't swallow food properly, and there is something (doctor says it's my hyoid bone), popping every time I turn my head. When I was first afraid of esophageal cancer, or thyroid cancer, I stopped. I had quit for 5 days. 5 DAYS! That's as long as I've ever gone in 7 years while not pregnant. I was in the homestretch! As crazy as it sounds to people, smoking is my mechanism to deal with the stress and worry about what is wrong. I got my results back, and everything is clear. My fucking brain and actions aren't coinciding here, and I'm in a constant battle with myself. "Oh, you don't have cancer, well you're ok to smoke". "No you're not. youre lucky the results were negative, but youre still doing damage, and may i remind you that your throat is swollen to the point you cant breathe while wearing a t-shirt, speak properly, or even sing to your children anymore?!"  Basically, the only answer to the swelling IS the smoking, and I'm still doing it. I feel like a lost cause. If this can't make me stop, What the hell will? I just choose denial, and a Scarlett O'Hara "I'll think about it tomorrow" attitude. A little background, I'm a stay at home mom to a 3 and a soon to be 2 year old. If I don't have my cigarette break, I don't get a break, at all. It is my downfall. I need to find a way to deal with the stress, and be able to walk away, and take a break, without using cigarettes as an excuse. It's my only "me" time, and it sounds awful, but it's all I have. I'm having trouble giving it up.

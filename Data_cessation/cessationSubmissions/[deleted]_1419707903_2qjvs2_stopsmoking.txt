some random thoughts

heya I've been smoking since 2010 and stopping smoking since November last year :D 

so in this process after relapsing yesterday and smoking cigs together with weed for the second time I've had some thoughts: 
The added difficulty for people with mental health issues. 
Because actually stopping smoking isn't very hard. If you read a withdrawal report of hard drugs you'll never whine about your nictotine withdrawal again. This means its easy to focus on the advantages of not smoking and that makes it easy. However, this foccuses is still required and for people whose minds are occupied by their mental health issues it's much harder. 

e: these captchas are absurdely hard.

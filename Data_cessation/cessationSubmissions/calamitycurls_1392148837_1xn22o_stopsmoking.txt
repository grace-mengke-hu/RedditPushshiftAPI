Grumbling and hateful on Day 3.

I feel really low about it, but I will probably sleep a good deal more today. I am so very cranky and gruesome, I don't know how to react to anything. I dont even want a smoke, I just want to yell at everyone. Is this normal for third day withdrawl? 

Also, holy crap my armpits! swamps of awful stench.  Still not smoking, but damn, that's gross!

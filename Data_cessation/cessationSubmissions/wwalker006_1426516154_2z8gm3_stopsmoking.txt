Am I fooling myself thinking quitting will be easy?

I have tried to quit before and it has failed but this time I feel like its different. Before I tried quitting when I truly loved smoking and that made it difficult. But the other day it hit me that I don't love them anymore. I finished my pack and just decided to stop. No matter what my mentality is will the withdraws become an issue? (pretty heavy smoker, about half a pack a day)

For 5 years, I've had panic attacks, heart palpitations, low energy, lower sex drive and now I'm done.

Last Friday I smoked a few cigarettes with my friends. These past 5 days I have had horrible heart palpitations that have woken me up from sleep. I have had scary as shit pains in my arm and chest that won't go away with massages. I've had mild anxiety attacks border lining on full on panic attacks. I'm 27 years old. I'm not going to pretend that I've 100% mentally got it together, but I am a pretty stable person. These panic attacks have ruined my Sundays and who I want to be and are 100% related to smoking. I can't believe how long it took me to make the connection and then how long it took me to say NO MORE! I used to smoke 6 cigarettes a day then stopped smoking completely for 6 months. During that time anxiety and panic attacks disappeared completely. The last 6 months I have only smoked a few cigarettes on the weekends, and my panic attacks, anxiety, heart palpitations, chest pain, are now all present.

My point is, don't dismiss minor anxiety or even full blown panic attacks as having nothing to do with smoking. It can and in many cases IS THE REASON FOR YOUR HEALTH ISSUES. Real talk, you may not have any health issues now, but from my experience and experience talking to older smokers, whatever health issues you start to feel will only get worse if you continue to smoke.

TL;DR: Even a few cigarettes on the weekend can affect your health in a negative way.

1 week... need a plan

I quit smoking a week ago today. My husband also smokes and has been out of town, which has made it easier for me. He knows that I want to quit and he says he does too, but when we’ve tried to quit together in the past one of us ends up smoking and then the other caves as well. He’s coming home tonight or tomorrow. 

Suggestions for not picking up another cigarette even if he does?! It’s been a way for us to step out of the house together and have a few minutes alone here and there since our 3 kids know they can’t be around while we’re smoking. I need a plan to replace the habits of going out for a smoke together.

The Smoke Free app needs your help

We're looking to test a new feature of the app that allows you to create an account with Facebook, Google or your email address and use that to restore your data. It's a feature lots of people who change/lose phones have requested because they want to keep their progress but don't have a backup of their phone.

Before we make this available to everyone we want to check that it works fully. It works for us, but there's only so much testing we can do.

If you're interested and have an iPhone please sign up for testing here: https://smokefreebeta.herokuapp.com/

If you're on Android please email testers@smokefreeapp.com

Please note, there is a chance that the restore won't work for you. So please make a backup of your phone first as restoring that will bring back any data our custom restore fails to.

Here to answer any questions you have about this.

Thank you.

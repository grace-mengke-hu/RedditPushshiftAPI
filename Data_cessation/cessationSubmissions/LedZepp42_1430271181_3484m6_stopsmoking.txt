20 year old smoker.

Hey, I'm 20 and have been smoking for about 2 years now. I smoke anywhere from a pack a day to a pack every 3 days depending on what I'm doing. I've been noticing lately that my urge to smoke has stemmed from killing 5-7 minutes I have nothing to do and just liking the "feeling" of smoking. What are some things you guys can suggest to replace that urge? I've seen people say keep a rubber band on your wrist and smack yourself when you get the urge, or shuffle a deck of cards etc. Any suggestions?

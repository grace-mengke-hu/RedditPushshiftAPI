After 8 years of smoking and months of trying and failing to quit, I'm finally making it happen... almost day 3!

For the last couple months I've tried to quit and I would fail DAILY. But I never stopped resetting my app and coming here to lurk around. It almost started to feel like my anxiety about failing- and the fear that I'd never quit- was overcoming my actual desire to smoke.

I'm not sure I could have put myself in the right mindset without reading Allen Carr's book, and I got the idea from here so thank you SO much, Reddit. Even in such a short time, with each passing day I am being shocked by what I can do, and I am proud of myself. Dare I say... I'm loving life a lot more than I thought I would at this point. After some cleaning my car smells nice. I go to school and my clothes smell nice and I smell nice! I'm looking forward to running again and pushing myself and eating Mexican food and buying a candle for my no-longer-smokey apartment.

I did expect more congestion and coughing than what I've experienced. I've taken long, hot showers and slept with a humidifier, but nothing seems to be "loose". What I have mostly been experiencing is suddenly waking up in the morning. The first morning after I quit I was wide awake at 7am, 30 minutes before my alarms were suppose to go off. This morning I did the same thing at 6am. Usually, before now, it was a battle to drag my ass out of bed. Anyone else have this happen?

Quitter here...

Hello everyone,

I've been lurking around for quite a while, as I officially quit IIRC around April 2012... but since then, now and then, I have a cigarette or two (or sometimes, in a binge, way more than that). Not very often (once per a couple of months), which is why I was kinda making up excuses to myself that it's alright... but now, I've decided, that I don't want to have this lingering temptation around forever, so here I am! Hope it goes well for you fellows too, and wish me luck.

Thank you for reading this!

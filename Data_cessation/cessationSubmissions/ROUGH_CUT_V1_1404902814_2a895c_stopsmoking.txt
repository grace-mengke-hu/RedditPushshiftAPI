only a month?

I stopped checking this sub for a awhile, as it's gotten easier and easier now.  I looked quite a bit in the beginning for support to stay strong.   But I cam back today to see what my exact count was, and I really thought I was at least 6 weeks.  Lost track... but hey, I'm not disappointed :)  At least I didn't come back to reset my badge.

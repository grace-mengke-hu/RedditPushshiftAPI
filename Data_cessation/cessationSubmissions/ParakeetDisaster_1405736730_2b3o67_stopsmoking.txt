This isn't even my final form...

So after roughly 12 days, I can safely say I have discovered a new form of cravings that have been difficult to master. These creeping cravings are not the urgent and intense desires that struck in the first few days, they're more psychological.

* "You've done so well, and one little slip won't hurt"
* "If you only smoke one tonight, you can pick up where you left off tomorrow"
* "You don't want to spend tonight obsessing. Smoke one so you can relax and have some fun"

I'm kind of having a rough time with it, but I keep reminding myself that I am not a smoker. And I'm chewing gum like mad. I'm trying to remind myself that these cravings will disappear soon.

I'm sliding backwards and I think I need help

Hey everyone.

I'm reaching out because I'm having a really difficult time with my nicotine addiction. I had quit completely for about 18 months, then slipped when I was having a really bad day surrounded by smokers at work. Since then I've started using a vape, which feels like less of a failure than smoking, but I still wish I was nicotine free again.

Lately I've been really anxious and stressed and it's making me want to smoke again. The only thing keeping me from doing it at this point is knowing that I'd want to hide it from my wife because she cried the last time I smoked in front of her.

I've quit drinking, smoking pot, and even quit fucking painkillers and amphetamines, but nicotine has been the hardest. I feel weak and hopeless.

I don't know where else to seek out help at this point. What do I do?

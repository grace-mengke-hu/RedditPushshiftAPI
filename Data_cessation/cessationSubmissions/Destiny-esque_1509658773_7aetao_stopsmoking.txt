3 months of freedom!

I have always been someone who seemed like they were in a hurry and I was. I used to rush to the store so I could smoke before I went in and rushed to get out so I could smoke before I get in my car. I used to rush away from the dinner table. For the past two months, because lets be honest that first one is brutal, I have noticed that I am no longer in that hurry anymore! Keep your heads up quitters the non smoking future is so much more enjoyable.

Giving up smoking

Hey guys!

Just posting here really to encourage myself. 

I’ve been smoking “full time” for about two years now. My habit has gone up from 10 to 20 and finally to about 30 skinny cigarettes a day!

Sadly, cigarettes are extremely cheap where I live and it makes breaking the habit harder.

I really want to give up and I want to give up cold turkey. I’ve tried nicotine patches before but they give me mad palpitations even on low doses.

I can feel my health suffering from smoking. I get random chest pains, random wheezing, a tight and sore throat and going up stairs is like running a marathon.

Thanks for all the inspiring posts here and please excuse me if I add to my own thread occasionally just to keep me on target.

Wish me luck!

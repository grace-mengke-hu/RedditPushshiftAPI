130 days in, suddenly have cravings

Last week or so I feel like my self control has gotten weaker.

During these 4 months I have had dreams of me smoking several times, and I felt bed after them. But the last time I dreamt somebody offering me a cigarette, I politely refused and told them I do not smoke. That felt like a big achievement for me, that I'm not even smoking in my dreams.

But why do I suddenly get these cravings, I think this is the hardest point for me during the quitting period after the initial week or two.

I think it might have something to do with me discovering that my GF has been secretly smoking, even though we stopped together, but it might be something more. Anyway I could use some words of encouragement right now, it's been hard lately.


EDIT:
Thanks everyone :]

Can I please have some advice for a dude 36 hours into a quit

I attended a party last weekend: 70+hours in, with a patch and caved. Since then I've seen the Allen Car video and  decided to try without patches or gum..

**Current Problem is as follows:** I'm going fishing tomorrow on a small boat with my grandfather and his friend (both heavy smokers)

Also when we get back I have another party I have been asked to attend.. once again it will be packed with smokers...

Anyone have words of wisdom?

Getting of chest

Im working now at callcentre telemarketing, its stressful as fuck, im doing it to  get some work experience so i can work at other Jobs where is trading, social skills required. Problem is that i dont sell nothing, i have some kind of block and i cant get past it, i know what to do i just cant take action when im calling and it pisses me off cause i know i can do it. 

Anyways everybody is smoking there and i never worked in such stressful work so it ads up. I know maybe it sounds like too much crying, but i really dont mind the job, i mind that im not good at it as i want to be, and if anybody else can make the sales i can do it too, but im losing Hope...

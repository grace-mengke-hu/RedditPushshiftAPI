14 days and my progress so far, and a massive thank you, I doubt I'd get this far without this sub.

Well surely but slowly I'm getting there, I no longer go into shops and have to restrain myself from getting smokes, a couple of times I've not even thought about it.

Driving was the biggest thing, during the first week everytime I knew I'd be driving somewhere id think "great i can have a ciggy" but remembered I didn't smoke and would stress out.

I honestly feel like my sense of humour has changed, I feel happier, everything seems more fun and I can joke and smile about anything, although there have been 2 or 3 times where I'd get angry for absolutely no reason but that seems to have stopped overall

I've used no aids what so ever, no patches, gum or electronic puffers because I'm quitting a habit not starting another one.

In terms of money I've saved around Â£70 in 14 days which is the biggest thing, I've bought new clothes and a few other bits and bobs knowing it makes no difference to my monthly budget and smoking no longer takes a large part of that.

Not sure why I'm writing all this but thought a few of you might like the read, and possibly relate In your experience.

Also to the would-be quitters, if I can get this far, so can you! I have a terribly addictive personality and im not always the most rational person thus wanting a cigarette over the smallest things but I'm doing well so far. 

As I said in other posts, I kept a half a pack on me for around the first week of quitting, this kept me calm knowing that they were there. I didn't have to smoke them but they were there. Better to have them and not need them, than need them and not have them. After a week or so, I took them crushed them up and threw them in the bin. This might be the key that helps you quit, it might not help at all. But you can try.

Thanks guys.

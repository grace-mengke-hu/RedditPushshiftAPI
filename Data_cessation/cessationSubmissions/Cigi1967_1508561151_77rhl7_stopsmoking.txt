I almost lost it today...

Went with a friend this evening for a few drinks and a light meal to a local bar. She was smoking which didn't really bother me in the sense of I want to light up but she kept taking deep drags and litterely blowing it in my face. This is the first time I almost ran out the door. It was awful.  I didn't think I'd ever ate the smell of smoke as much as I did today.

Just started...but feels good!

I decided just to cheer my stop and feels good attempt, I m 23 and i started smoking really at 16 and I know im on the good side of life for stop. Mostly because its always the good moment for stop as it is always the bad moment to start puffing cancer in any lunghs.

So lets just do it! It's not my first attempt. Maybe it is the fifth, i got even 3 months 2 times. but this time i feel im not going to be fooled again. Thats it. 

Now its gonna be the few annoying days but its going to be it!! 

And i loce this sub for the support it gave me to start doing it again!!

Thanks to everyone!

Ps i decided that each time the monster will kick in i will just sing loudly or within myself: 
im free and im feeling good! 
Just for fun...i will tell how does it works

Day 50!

I've smoked for 12 years at a pack every 2 days. I had quit 3 other times with the longest being a few weeks. I even believe I cheated here and there too during those other times. However, not this time...I haven't had a single puff from a cigarette. Cold turkey. I did not think this was possible for me. 

I'm at 50 days and here's to another 50 days. Thank you to everyone here. You guys are awesome! 

Also, Allen Carr's book help me make that extra leap towards quitting, which I heard about from this sub. Thank you for the recommendation.

Life is sooo much better without nicotine..

I’m on day 24 without a wretched ciggie and the things that have helped me are as follows:
- Smokefree app has been helpful as it encourages participation through this forum and allows me to relate to all the other posts here in. 
- biggest one is simply “think of something else”. Sounds obvious and cliche but it has worked. My last failed attempts at quitting I found my consciousness battling with itself wanting to have a smoke until the turmoil was too much then I’d light one up. As soon as the thought to smoke arises, identify with it, then focus attention elsewhere. 
- meditation has been helpful as well as yoga. Deep breathing and getting better at dealing with the ‘noise’ inside my head. 
- zero NRT
- Being more active and finding a new hobby and setting myself goals- I have bought a stand up paddle board with the money I’ve saved and want to start participating in races. 
- being constantly grateful to that I’m no longer in the grips of the nicotine monster. 

Wishing you guys all success in all your endeavours. Life kicks ass without filthy smokes!

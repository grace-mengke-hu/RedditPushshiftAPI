Looking for quitting advise~Have quit 2wice for 40+ days then relapse

Greetings all fighting the good fight whether you're losing or winning!

I am 28 years old and have been smoking consistently(addicted) for about 2 years now. I originally switched over to smoking cigarettes when I was trying to stop smoking so much marijuana so you could say I traded one habit for another; one coping mechanism for the other.

I have tried to quit smoking over 5 times now with 2 very successful attempts where I made it over 40 days. What seems to happen is I start out with much forward momentum and have found it helpful to use marijuana at night during the first week or two of the quitting process. After this I subside on the weed usage and seem to be going strong feeling better about my health and my wallet! 

At about the 1 month mark I start to feel almost like a delayed response as all these negative effects hit me like a ton of bricks. I become very un-cognitive, restless, nothing interests me, such little clarity or ambition to even get in the shower let alone tackle anything else in life, so I fold after feeling like this for about a week or so without it subsiding. The light at the end of the tunnel seems ambiguous  

Everything I have read says the first 2 weeks should be the hardest and all better from there, but in my experience the first 2 weeks really aren't that hard once I've made up my mind to quit its the 4-6 week period that I haven't been able to transcend

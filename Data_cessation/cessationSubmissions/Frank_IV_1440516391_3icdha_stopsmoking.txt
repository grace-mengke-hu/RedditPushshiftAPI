How's your sleeping?

I've quit in the past for up to 4-5 months, and I do remember the sleeping pattern being a bit 'off'. But I feel this time it's even worse; 

I seem to spend a large proportion of the night in REM sleep with a lot of vivid dreaming in a very light sleep state. This of course makes it really easy to wake up at night. 

I'm also not drifting off to sleep easily despite being really tired. 

And I'm finding really difficult to get up in the morning. 

However, I do of course feel physically better for not smoking, and this is more just a casual observation rather me complaining about quitting. 

How did/is sleeping affect you during the first few weeks?

Trying.

So I've been trying to quit for the last 23 days. I used the 21mg patch for the first two weeks and just decided to go cold turkey do to finances. I've had a few slip ups where I've been drinking and have had one or two at night. I use to smoke about a pack a day for the last 14/15 years.

I am at work, having some coffee, waiting for a patient to come in and all I can think about is having a cigarette. I want one. My anxiety is through the frigging rough and I feel like my skin is crawling.

Gum doesn't help anymore.

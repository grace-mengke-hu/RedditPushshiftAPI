Day 145: Fight for a better life

Hi Guys

So currently I am at day 145. At the moment my relationship with smoking is close to non-existent. But I would lie to say I didn't have any urges. They were present from time to time. And there were cigarettes offered to me. And it was easy. Easy to resist, easy to say no. 
You know what fascinates me? There are millions of people being unaware. Unaware of the bad sites of smoking. Unaware of their bodies. And for some of them you quitting makes them think. I am pretty sure, subconsciously, that there are people trying to make it harder for you. Be it by joking, offering, not understanding, belittling the effects of smoking or passive aggressively diminishing your achievement. 
"You'll start again in a week, haha. No, I'm just joking." But they weren't really.
"Do you want one too? I wouldn't have offered but I don't want to be stingy or rude." But you know what? Offering is rude if the other person is stopping. We don't stop for an hour or a day. We are developing a new lifestyle. And in my new lifestyle I do not smoke. You wouldn't have offered one to a non smoker, would you?
I just want to show you, our friends and family could make our struggle harder. And not at all do I think they do that because of ill intentions, not consciously anyway. Your own struggle and sometimes external struggle makes this decision and getting rid of this shitty habit a hard battle. 
I know you can win that fight. And I feel deep respect for you, trying and overcoming that hard fight. You have strength in you. Now use it to create a better life. Because nothing less than that do you deserve.

Much love and respect

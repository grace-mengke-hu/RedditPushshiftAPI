I need some guidance.

I'm 22 now, and have been smoking pretty regularly since I was sixteen (10 - 20 cigarettes daily). I wake up every morning with what feels like someone standing on my chest while I gasp for air. The longest I have quit for was 3 months, and that was about 3 years ago. Since then, I have done a bunch of "mini-quits,"  which have all been thwarted by stress. Perhaps more accurately, a lack of conviction to stay quit. 

I am telling you all of this because I really don't want to be trapped. I'm sick of this addiction,  I'm sick of feeling sick, and sick of this lifestyle. 

So I come to you folks for guidance on where to start, but more importantly,  support. The only kind of support I get in the real world is "you should quit" and "smoking is bad for you." 

I have seen some of the successes that have transpired as a result of this subreddit, and I know that if you folks can do it, "angle and vector be damn we're going to the moon! " (I can do it)

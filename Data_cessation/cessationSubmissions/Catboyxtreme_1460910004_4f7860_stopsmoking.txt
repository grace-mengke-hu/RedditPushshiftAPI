5 Days unwavering. Don't fear withdrawal.

HI everyone, just want to brag about how awesome it feels to have quit smoking. I quit 5 Days ago cold turkey after smoking between 10 and 15 cigarettes a day for the past 8 years. And I wanted to share a bit of my experience so far for anyone who is where I was for the past 2 years of my life. 
      everytime I would light up in the past I would say to myself I'm my head how stupid I am for smoking how it's going to kill me how much money I'm wasting and how I knew one day I would have to quit. But I kept putting it off and putting it off, maybe next week or next month or after the busy season at work. 
Well I just want to say that I ripped up my last pack on a whim and it was the best whim that ever happened to me. I've been 123 hours without a smoke and I truly wish I had done this year's ago.
Don't get me wrong the cravings at times have been crippling, day 3 and 4 were especially hard, with several cravings causing me to stop, breathe deeply and say TP myself "I can do this". But I'll be honest apart from those cravings quitting hasn't been half as bad as I worried it would be. I'm trying not to get cocky but I feel so much better than I have, that it's hard not to be blindly exuberant. 
I hope anyone out there who's been thinking to themselves "man I gotta quit smoking soon" takes heart and has the strength to take the plunge. Cause really, it's not so bad friend. Just take it one minute at a time. 
Thanks for reading!

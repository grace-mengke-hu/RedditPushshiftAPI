Foggy brain

Started work today, felt my brain partly paralyzed. Went to the gym, really outdone myself, now tired and feeling slightly better. Waiting for day 10 when I know from prev quits things get even better. Hope all you quiters out there are riding the quit wave, weâ€™ll get on the shore eventually !

How many times have you reset your "quit date"?

Hi everyone. This is my first post here (as well as on Reddit in general), although I have been visiting this sub regularly for more than a year. 

Over this year I have resent my "quit date" at Smoke Free app so many times that I am not sure about the exact number anymore. 50? 70? More? The last several months have been especially nasty, as sometimes I would change the quit date every day. I guess I am curious if I am alone in this, or is it something that many encounter?

So my question is to those who have experienced something similar: how many times has it happened to you? Overall, have you succeeded in "fixing" your quit? 

And to those who managed to quit from the first try: congratulations! How are you feeling now?

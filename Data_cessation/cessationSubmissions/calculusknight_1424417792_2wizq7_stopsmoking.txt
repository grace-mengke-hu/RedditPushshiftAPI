I didn't believe it, but it really gets easier. But one thing puzzles me

Day 4 and I'm much more relaxed than I was yesterday. For the first time, I get the feeling that this is something I'll just succeed at.

But one thing: Did anyone else have stomach trouble when you quit? I feel like I've eaten ten pounds of beans in chili sauce.

2 days in. Jonesin' hard.

I'm in a recovery program/halfway house type thing that includes urine tests and decided, hey, if I have to quit smoking weed and drinking, I might as well get completely clean and quit smoking cigarettes too. It's hard because quite a few people here smoke, and there's not much to do if you're stuck in the box without passes to go into town.

Exercise and gum are my next move. Wish me luck.

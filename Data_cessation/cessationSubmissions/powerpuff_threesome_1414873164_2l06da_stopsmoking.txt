At 10PM tonight, it will have been 48 hours since my last cigarette.

Started Chantix one week ago today and since you can smoke during the first week of dosage, I shamefully took advantage.  

I smoked my last cigarette Thursday night.

Nearly two days in now, and I feel like I can do this.  I'm thinking about smoking constantly, but in an "It'd be nice to have one" kind of way rather than the "I need one and I'll cut you if you get in my way" type of manner. 

Just gotta stay strong, I guess.

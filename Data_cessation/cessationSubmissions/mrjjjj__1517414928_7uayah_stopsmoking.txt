Day 1 again.

I stopped smoking weed for about 4 months. Today is the day where I have to start over again.Right now I'm back to being high again (currently atm) which I think allowed me to see things differently in another perspective. It made me introspect of what I want and what I don't from my life. Since I quit smoking weed, I started picking up another habit of cigarettes. Which to be honest is really bad for young teenagers like me. I've been trying my best to keep my addiction contained by smoking because I was bored and had nothing to do. It made me realize it was time to change my habits and the way I think.  
I've realized that it is not too late to change
I've realized that it is just wasting my time, money, and my health. 
I've realized that it is very important sometimes just to pause before doing something. 
I've realized the only way for me to beat addiction is through changing my habit, which means having a good discipline. 
I've realized that this is not real happiness but sadness. 
I've realized I have to communicate how I feel to people, and not suppress my feelings if I feel them. 
My addiction made me feel numb. I want to be able to express how ifeel, is the feeling that I need to feel in order to be alive again.

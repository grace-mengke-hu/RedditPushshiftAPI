5 days, still nervous, but now extremely fatigued

Today is day 5 without smoking. Yesterday I stopped using my nicorette lozenges and haven't had any today either. 

The cravings are still really bad but I think I'm handling them decently. 

I've just realized that I'm literally always tired now. No matter how much sleep I got, I'm still constantly tired. Any tips for how to deal? Or should I just keep napping my life away?

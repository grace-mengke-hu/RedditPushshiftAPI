tonight it was the end of the world

tonight it was the end of the world with the kids and the husband always working late on our house after his job... I was looking at the cigarettes on the counter like it was the solution to my sadness... but I didn’t touch them I was vaping like crazy but I make it !!! 19 day without smoking cigarettes and I’m so proud !!!

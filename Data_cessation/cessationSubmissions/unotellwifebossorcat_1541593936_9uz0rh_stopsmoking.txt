I quit smoking 2 years ago and I haven't felt truly awake a single day since.

I used to smoke about 30 cigarettes a day, starting the with three to accompany the morning coffee (in lieu of breakfast). I never really felt any impediment to my health, apart from the expected cough. (Or so I thought at the time).

Quit cold turkey because my then-girlfriend didn't like the smell. Just finished my pack and didn't buy another one. It was much easier than I expected. What was hardest was the missing rituals, and routines. The thinking breaks on the patio with a soda/juice/coffee and a cigarette where I planned what to do next or pondered a problem. Reading magazines, as I can't seem to bring myself to read one without having a smoke.

**Anyway, the biggest changes since I stopped have been**

\- **No more trouble falling asleep**. I used to lay awake for 30-60 minutes, mind racing, before finally falling asleep. Now I just lay down and doze off within two or three minutes.

**- I constantly feel tired!** Or at least, I never feel truly awake. Not like I used to. Eyelids and limbs always feel heavy and I routinely almost fall asleep at boring meetings.

Actually the title was a lie. There was one day: The day about a year ago when I chose to smoke a nostalgia cigarette in the morning. Finally felt what I remembered as "awake" again. Later that day I almost puked and passed out after smoking two in a row and I haven't touched a cig since.

Has anyone else been dealing with this? I know nicotine is a stimulant, but I didn't expect this. Caffeine doesn't seem to be able to hold a candle to it. Coffee doesn't do anything for me (and I don't feel more tired if I don't have any on a given day.)

I'm thinking about trying to go on Ritalin or similar... I'm tired of the lack of energy, concentration and creativity I have gotten accustomed to.

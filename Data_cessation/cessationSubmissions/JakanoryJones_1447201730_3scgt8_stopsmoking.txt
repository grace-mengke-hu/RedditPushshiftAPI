Just over 12 hours or something.

I've got asthma and I've smoked since I was like 14 or something and I'm at the arse end of 21 right now AND I went back to college (which is super weird, everyone's younger than me) which stressed me out a bit and I started smoking more.

But whatever anyway, I woke up not being able to breathe again this morning and my inhaler just wasn't doing it for me. And I pretty much decided then and there that I'm not doing it anymore.

Sgoin okay so far. Was offered a fag like a half hour ago and I said no. Sgood.

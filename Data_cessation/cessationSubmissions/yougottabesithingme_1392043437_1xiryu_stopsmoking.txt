When Will This Get Better?

I'm tired guys.  I'm really, really tired.  It's been over 8 weeks and I'm tired of muscle cramps and that all-over feeling of "wrongness" that's like hunger or sleepiness but its own separate special "I need a cigarette" feeling.  I'm tired of being afraid to talk to my wife or my son because I'm going back and forth between being horrifically irritable and so moody/depressed that I want to curl up and cry.  I'm tired of cravings that last way longer than 2-5 minutes, tired of spending half an hour or more clenching and unclenching my hands and trying to stop vividly thinking about the taste, the warmth, the feel of the cigarette between my fingers and my lips, of the rush of satisfaction and pleasure that would come as the nicotine hit my blood.  I fantasize about smoking more vividly now than I fantasized about sex when I was a teenager.

I'm tired of feeling so awful and knowing that I could feel better in a matter of minutes if I just walked down to the gas station.  I've beaten another addictive drug before, but after the first couple weeks of getting the chemical completely out of my system it wasn't anywhere near this bad.  I'd still want it sometimes, still do want it sometimes, but it wasn't like *this*.  I thought that after the first couple weeks it was supposed to get easier, it feels like it's getting harder and harder everyday.

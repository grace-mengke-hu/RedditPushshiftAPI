Ten days! Holy mother of nicotine!

I've smoked since I was 15 (7 years) and I never thought it would be this easy to stop! I'm so excited so I just wanted to update  you guys on three things I've encountered  so far on this short but ongoing smoke-free journey: 

1) smoker friends are not good friends after you've quit. Mine have been increasingly negative about it, telling me I can't do it, that it's pointless that I've quit and remain intent on blowing smoke in my face and bragging about their freedom at any chance they get! But what they don't realise is that I can smell how terrible they smell afterwards and that only makes me more determined. 

2) I never thought it was possible to smell at taste this much!! I'm finding that for the first time, food is awesome. Flavours are awesome. Smells are like a whole new dimension of amazing! I no longer wake up with a shit taste in my mouth, my hair doesn't smell like a bonfire and wearing perfumes is fun. I feel like a real woman! SNIFF ME!!  

3) after coughing up brown shitty snot, getting nose bleeds, waking up coughing until I threw up, I finally realise the damage I was doing/ have done to myself. I didn't ever stop for the health benefits, I stopped for vanity. However, there's now more of a reason to stay smoke free forever. I may not be able to reverse the damage I've done, but I'll spend the rest of my life making up for it. 

Good luck guys! It's such a liberating and powerful feeling! To those of you who have yet to stop, do it and don't look back. To those who have stopped, high five! 

TL;DR: I am a fine-smelling, smoke-free goddess and I don't need no cigarette!

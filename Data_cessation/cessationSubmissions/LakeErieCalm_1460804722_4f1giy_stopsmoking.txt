2 Weeks, no nicotine. Keeping it simple

So I quit 2 weeks ago today and it was hell.  The first 2 days were unusually bad, but that was it.  Things are now much better.  The keys are 1) No substitutes...  Do not go down the road of nicotine substitutes.  The addiction needs to be broken and will not be with substitutes.  This is an important point that I am only now learnning in my 40's. 2) Stay busy!  Good luck everyone!  Fuck you Nicotine Cartel!

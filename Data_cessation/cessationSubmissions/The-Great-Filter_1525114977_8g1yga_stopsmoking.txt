Help!!! 4th day of quit and a huge craving!

I'm into my fourth day and in the middle of the biggest craving by far. I'm just into bed trying to fall asleep but it's becoming harder and harder to resist. Right now I'm with my family at least so I know I won't smoke but tomorrow I'll be free and alone and I don't know what's going to happen. Any tips from someone who has gone through this?

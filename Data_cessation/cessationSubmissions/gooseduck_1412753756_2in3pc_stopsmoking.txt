Day 1, Again

So here we go again. Another attempt to quit. The longest I've had is 2.5 months, but that doesn't really matter as much as the 12 hours so far currently.

Cravings are OK, at the moment - I'm looking forward to getting my sense of smell and taste back, and losing the cough which has just gone into overdrive since I've stopped smoking.

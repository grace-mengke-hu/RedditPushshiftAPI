So Stupid

After smoking for 12 years, I quit on May 30, 2009. Hadn't had a cigarette in 5 years and what happened? Yep, had a stressful day on Friday,  June 13, 2014 and here I am getting ready to quit again tomorrow. I'm so pissed at myself! Of course the even more ridiculous thing was that I started smoking for the first time at age 26! Hi everyone! ğŸ˜ƒ

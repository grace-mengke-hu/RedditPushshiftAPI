Light smoker - can nicotine gum be too strong?

I've been smoking 5-10 cigarettes a day for the past 3-4 years. I decided I want to try and quit, so I bought some 4 mg nicotine gum off Amazon. Looking at the packaging, it says it says the product strength is suitable for those that smoke over 20 a day. Is there a downside if I were to chew these? Should I look for a different alternative to quit smoking?

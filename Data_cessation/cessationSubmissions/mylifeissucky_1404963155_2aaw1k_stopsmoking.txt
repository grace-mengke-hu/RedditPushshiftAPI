After a night of fukked up dreams, I had a good day

except at the *Other Walmart* on the other side of town, at first. That was a triggery situation. I remember going outside to have smokes there. I saw some people smoking and smelled a cigarette there as well.

I gave myself a consolation prize of a Big Mac Deal at the McDonalds there for not smoking and bought a little Yoshi from Mario Bros on a small scale motorcycle as the other half of the prize for making it out of that boss level alive and not banged up.

No, I didn't cave this time either, but it seemed worse somehow. I still hung on though.

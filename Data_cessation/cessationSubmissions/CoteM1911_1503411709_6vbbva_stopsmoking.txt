What are all these smells?!

I'm 7 days in my second attempt to quit in the last 6 months. (been smoking for 15 years). I took my dog for a walk after dinner the other night (was having a pretty decent craving). As  walked through the neighborhood I could literally smell different peoples houses. One was doing laundry, one was cooking outside, one had a fire, one mowing the lawn, one smoking.... but I actually could distinguish all of these. That's insane to me. 

The last time I quit (40ish days) I fucking hated every second of every day I didn't smoke. I never stopped to smell the roses. I insisted I couldn't tell a difference in taste or smells. I insisted I felt no different even after a month. I was SO SALTY about quitting I refused to recognize any of the benefits I was having. I have a totally different attitude this time around and it's CRAZY all the shit I'm noticing. It's only been 7 days and this non smoker life is pretty sweet so far and I know it's only going to get better. 

This isn't all rainbows and sunshine, some moments I get a tough craving, but with this new weirdly positive attitude I have I pass through them by literally talking to myself. 'I'm not a smoker.' Pop in some cinnamon gum and move on with my day. I refuse to let a nicotine/cig craving ruin my entire day.

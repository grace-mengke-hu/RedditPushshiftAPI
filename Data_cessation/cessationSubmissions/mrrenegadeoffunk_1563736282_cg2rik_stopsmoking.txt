I'm embarrassed that I ever belived quitting wasn't endurable. From now on I will be in control of my life and choices, not addiction.

This is it, today was the day I refused to stay a slave to my addiction. 

I despise the fact that I've been addicted, I won't let my weaknesses define me. I'm in control. I want to better myself and I will prove that I can.

&gt; “Everything that happens is either endurable or not. If it’s endurable, then endure it. Stop complaining. If it’s unendurable … then stop complaining. Your destruction will mean its end as well. Just remember:  you can endure anything your mind can make endurable, by treating it as in your interest to do so. In your interest, or in your nature.”

I wish you all the best! We can do this. I'll be back even if I fail, but I'm feeling more motivated than ever.

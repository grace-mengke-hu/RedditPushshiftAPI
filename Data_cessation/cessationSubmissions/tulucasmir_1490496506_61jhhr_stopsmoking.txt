It's working!

I've been smoking for 5 years and tried to stop smoking couple of times but after I've seen couple of posts here and enthusiasm of you, now I feel like I will succeed this time. It's been around just fifteen days now but this time I can feel the willpower! I can feel and see the slight chances of my life and attitudes. Thanks to you guys! I don't say "I hope I won't smoke" but I'm saying "I'm sure I won't smoke anymore".

Good luck? No! Let's do this! We are more stronger than we think we are.

so im just under 2 months (shouldve requested badge :/) but now, more than ever, I'm craving one so bad.

I didn't request a badge because I didn't think I was gonna stick with it, more of a break I thought. But now I'm about to hit the two month mark this week and I can honestly say, I don't think I've ever wanted a cigarette more in my life. I've gone a few weeks without one before but always went back, but those times I didn't want one as bad as I do now. 
anyone else experience this?

Soon

Recently I’ve been working on turning my life around. I’ve began to eat healthier, try to lose weight, and become more active. I’m only 26 but I am in poor health. I’ve been smoking since I was in middle school (oh how I wish I could go back in time and slap myself. ). I quit for a month two years ago for a surgery and like an idiot the first thing I did when I got out of hospital, still sore from the surgery I had not hours before, was light up. I need to quit. Currently I am reading Allen Carr’s book. Half of me is starting to despise myself every time I have a cigarette, and the death stick itself. The other half is telling myself that it won’t work for me, that I’ll just continue smoking and continue being unhappy, unhealthy and always broke. But I know I can do this. Even after I finish, if I still have that need I’m going to push through it. I’m going to do everything that I can to do so. I can do this.

Sweating after quitting

Hey, i need some advice on the sweating that arrive after quiting. I have exema and use creams that smell a bit multiple times a day. The smoking helped hide the smell of the creams, but after i have quit i sweat more than before, and therefore smell alot. I't has come to the point that my mother has asked me to smoke again, since the smell from the sweat and the cream makes her embarrast on my part. How long will the sweating last, and is there anyting i can to to reduce the sweating that arrive during cravings?

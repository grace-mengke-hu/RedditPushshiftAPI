Feeling guilty about smoking weed

I'm 17 days into quitting but this weekend, I've been smoking weed (mixed with some tobacco) since I was visiting and hanging out with my brother. I had decided at the time of quitting that smoking weed is ok (even if mixed with some marijuana) but now I'm suddenly feeling guilty about that and going forward I'm making a rule that even if I smoke weed, it should not be mixed. 

I have had intense cravings to light up a cigarette but I've not given in. Should I reset my counter to zero and start again or does it still count as 17 days?

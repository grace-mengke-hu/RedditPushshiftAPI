My City Smells Like Shit! What "newly acquired" smells/tastes have you found out you like dislike once you got your senses back?

After 15 years of smoking, i am starting to get 100% smell and taste back and have been like a newborn trying all the things! Some fun stuff i realized in the past few days

* My city smells like shit, often. Alot of sewage...

* I like spicy but a lot of foods are alot spicier than i thought [i use to make fun of people for being wusses]

* I don't like the greasy taste of pizza buns anymore. This was my favourite food to eat while browsing the supermarket

* My SO smells. Really really good.

* Girls in public smell. Really really good.

* My shitty whisky tastes bad.

* The smell when breaking open a green pepper - never smelled it, like it

* I've been putting waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too many spices in my dishes when cooking


What "new" smells and tastes have you rediscovered?

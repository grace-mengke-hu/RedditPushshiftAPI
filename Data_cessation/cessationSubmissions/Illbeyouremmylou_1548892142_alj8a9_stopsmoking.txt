My Nan was diagnosed with Lung Cancer

Hey guys,

Today is a hard day. I’m so sad for my Nan. I’m sad that she will have to experience pain at the end of her life. Images of her in the shape of the warnings on cigarette packs are intruding my thoughts and my heart breaks for her. I will not smoke with you today. Let’s not smoke for my Nanny.

Don't read this if you're also on day 1, or even week 1.

I figure I slept through the first several hours of withdrawals, but once I was awake it got tough. It was easier in the early morning when I could roll back over and sleep more, but once I got out of bed I couldn't stop thinking about having one. The morning one, the one that wakes me up. Sitting in the sunshine, listening to the birds. It would have been glorious. But I won't. Maybe. Really this time. It's my fourth serious attempt to quit, and I've been a smoker for almost fifteen years. I know all the reasons I want to stop: my health, the cost, the social stigma. None of that matters, though. If I think too hard on the reasons to quit I'll discount them all and convince myself it's alright to go have one - just one more. I'm on the brink right now, that stage when reason becomes just a tool for the addiction to twist into making me give in. The cravings are constant and unyeilding. Every symptom is a reminder. There is an increasing tension in my neck and shoulders, and I have a mild headache. More than that, my head feels foggy. I can only seem to concentrate on the cravings. When I try to focus on anything else, I become confused and easily lose my place. They are all minor symptoms, but combined they make me feel useless, and strangely enraged. And I know, with absolute certainty, that all will be cured if I just have one. Maybe not even a whole one. Just a drag? I just want to feel like myself again.

I used to go a couple days without a smoke no problem. Now that I'm quitting, day three is a nightmare. What gives?

As I stated, I used to just skip one or two days when I was smoking. But now that I'm quitting it seems like a nightmare.

I know it's probably psychological because I know I'll never be going back, but it definitely feels physical.

Is day three a big threshold for everyone?

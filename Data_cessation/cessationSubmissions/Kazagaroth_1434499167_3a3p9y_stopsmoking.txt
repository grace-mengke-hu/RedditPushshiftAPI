Making it hard on myself, why do I do this...

I'm leaving for Navy RTC in about 60 days and have been quitting off and on for the last year.  


On my last attempt, I made it 10 days then said "fuck it I can just quit again later".  Smoked for two weeks, and quit again a few days ago.  


Problem is, when I get really drunk I don't care anymore and want a cig.  Last night I bought a pack of tobacco, rolled and smoked a bunch of small cigs, and hid it out of sight this morning.  


My lungs hurt, I need to stop.  However I am going to keep the tobacco.  I think I need to get used to the idea that cigs are going to be everywhere, and always easy to get, so if I can't quit with them in the same room as me, then there's no point to even try again.   


Suggestions?

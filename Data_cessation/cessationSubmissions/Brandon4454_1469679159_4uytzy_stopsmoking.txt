5 days...might be a quit journal.

So quitting this time has been pretty interesting. I'm using the 21 mg patch and plan after a month or so to drop down to the 14 then 7 and on a weekend stop entirely.  

I "quit" for a while back by using ecigs for about a year or so but didn't like them because I could use them anywhere and who knew how much nicotine I was ingesting.

I am not skipping any meals like I did when I was smoking. I am having to eat much more regularly. I also found myself buying a bunch of fruit and fruit juices. Mangos, strawberries, and blueberries are what I'm eating most of.

Around the third day of quitting smoking I had two very vivid dreams. I rarely ever dream and having two the same night was extremely unusual. I enjoyed them both though.

I'm trying to drink more water. I drank around 36 oz of water today.

I was leaving the patch on at night and am now removing it at night to give myself a little less nicotine.

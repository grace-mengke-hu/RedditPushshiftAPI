Struggling more in the fourth week. What have your experiences been?

I've been trying to quit smoking, with epic failure, on a regular basis for at least four years. Right now I have not had any nicotine whatsoever for four weeks as of this upcoming Friday morning. 

Amazingly, this is the longest quit I have ever managed. And, I actually feel that I will never smoke again. The idea of smoking does not appeal to me at all. 

However, I have always been prepared for the first three days to be the worst, and for the effects of withdrawal to slowly fade out over time after that. But, my experience has actually been that starting at about the three week mark, many of the withdrawal symptoms have been escalating. In particular, I feel very tired throughout the day, vague, physically weak and not mentally sharp. Essentially, I would be worried that I have a neurological condition, were it not for the fact that I recently quit smoking cold turkey. (I am 31/M.)

So, is this an experience others have had? If so, what happened? Any protips?

OMGGGG I drank and...

I didn’t have a cigarette craving, not even once!
I chugged almost one bottle of red wine, had water in between glasses, ate well, snacked on nuts and almonds and God I feel good!

Tomorrow at 9:30am I’ll hopefully complete ONE FREAKING WEEK :’)))) had to share this with you guys, I’m very overwhelmed right now, thank you so much for your support!

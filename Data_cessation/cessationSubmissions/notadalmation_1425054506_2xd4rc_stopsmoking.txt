I need to reset my flair to 0 days

Last year I read Alan Carr's book and successfully stopped smoking. Last month I started again. A friend of mine recently committed suicide and 9/10 at the memorial service were smoking and offering cigarettes because they knew me when I smoked. This is about the time I started again. Now I've been feeling all this awful guilt and shame from hiding it from most people in my life. 

Unfortunately I lent my copy of the book to a friend who is currently reading it (very slowly). I've been trying to remember the things that it said. It helped me so much at the time and now I am having a hard time seeing whatever it was that made it easy last time. Now it seems so hard. 

The fact that I'm working two jobs and going to school full time now is a big difference from last year as well. I'm already very stressed and I want to quit. Help?

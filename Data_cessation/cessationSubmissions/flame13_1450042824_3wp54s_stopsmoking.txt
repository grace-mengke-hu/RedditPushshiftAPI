Reddit Help!!!

I smoke about a pack and a half a day. I started 2012 and for the last 2 years, I think I've been smoking for at least a pack per day.

I used to be an athlete. And last August, I tried going back into basketball and realized I'm overweight (180cm/5'11" and 208lbs) when my knee started to hurt. I started dedicating myself and as of today, I'm 195lbs. I can play basketball again.

My only problem now is quitting smoking, which surprisingly is still a pack a day. I really need some help. :/

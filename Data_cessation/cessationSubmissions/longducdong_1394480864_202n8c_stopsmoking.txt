Day 25 and doing great. Partially thanks to information here. Encouragement for others!

So I have been trying to quit for a long time. I've actually been "quitting" for about 8 months now and I finally have 25 days nicotine free.  I just want to encourage others. It is so much easier than I thought!  I thought I loved smoking. I thought giving it up would be endless days of denying myself pleasure. It's not like that at all! My cravings went from these strong physical sensations in my chest that were like "pulling" me to smoke (during the first two weeks) to just a fleeting thought that I can quickly ignore.

Part of my success is do to [this article](http://whyquit.com/whyquit/LinksAAddiction.html) and how I implemented it. The article helped me learn that I didn't love smoking. I loved avoiding nicotine withdrawal.  I never let a thought about "wanting to smoke" pass through my head with out being challenged and called out for what it is: a lie!

Another big thing was that someone here posted a link to an article about synaptic pruning. It basically said that after 21 days of no smoking your brain returns to a non smoker brain.  I committed to giving myself 21 days with no nicotine and it's probably one of the best things I have done for myself in quite some time.

Just wanted to throw this out there. I used to feel pretty discouraged about quitting when I would hear from ex smokers talk about how "not a day goes by that I don't want a cigarrette." I totally thought this would be me. I smoked heavily for 14 years. I can honestly say that I haven't really thought about cigarettes much at all. I might have a quick thought about one but it passes without any impact.  I know that I'm not all the way there yet but I am confident that I'm done with smoking. I see cigarettes for what they are and I don't need them.  Hope this helps someone else

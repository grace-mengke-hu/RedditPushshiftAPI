I never have to smoke one of those disgusting things again.

Today is day 13 on Chantix, I just finished reading Alan Carr's book, just gave away the last of my smokes and had my "final cigarette".

It feels good. I know every quitter says that right away, but the book really changed my perspective. I remember previous quit attempts, looking at my last cigarette almost as if saying goodbye to an old friend that I would miss. I finally don't feel like I'm giving something up or sacrificing something. I know I'm not losing anything, I'm actually finally going to be free. No more scheduling my life around the next smoking opportunity. Just submitted a message to renew my badge and triggered the app "Smoke Free". Ill be checking in frequently to read others experiences. Hopefully I can have some good advice for new quitters soon!

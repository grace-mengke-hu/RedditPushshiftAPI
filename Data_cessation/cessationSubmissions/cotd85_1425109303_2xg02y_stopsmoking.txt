One week and a "short" story....

Hey guys, 

I'm feeling strong with the first week behind me and I wanted to share a bit about me and my life (both as a smoker and a non-smoker now). This might help people who want to stop or who are in their first days as well.


About me:

I am from Germany, 29 and I was the usual 10 to 20 smokes a day. I always told myself that I wanted to stop before I am 30 and although I still have some months to go I found this subreddit, saw the Video with the Allen Carr method and stopped smoking immediately. I read his book after the first day when someone posted the link here. I have been smoking the last 10 years.


I had a lot of attempts to stop so far. I even made it to 6 months with the Willpower method! And yeah if you fail such an attempt you lose a lot of hope and self confidence. I thought I might never be able to stop again. I talked myself into believing that I have an addictive character and that I just can't do anything against it. But the method by Allen Carr showed me a new side of quitting and gave me my confidence back! Now that I don't see a single positive side of smoking and realize that all it gave me were some kind of drug influenced beliefs I do not feel like missing out on something or making a huge sacrifice. If you do not realize this, I can tell you one thing: weak moments will come and no matter how long you stayed strong you might lose your path. 


Short story long:

[This](http://redd.it/2x324g) was the original post. I had a lot of fear about this event and I wanted to share the results with you to help people lose their fears as well. 
As you might have noticed I stayed strong. And it was as easy as Allen Carr tells you. I didn't get a single craving (!) and felt a little pity inside myself for the ones who are still locked up in the nicotine prison. (Instead of envy them as I did with my other attempts!) But I need to tell you that I did not drink alcohol. Yeah I went to a Tequila Bingo with the intention to not drink --' even though I am not the religious one I had the feeling of getting some help with my plans. Our table was one of the few who didn't win a single round of shots :P
But I wanted to share some positive experiences that came along with the night out. 

* I realized that when the 2 smokers at my table went out for a smoke we had some good laughs which I would have missed out on. Every time they came back they needed some moments to join back the conversation or asked questions about what we were talking. Not a huge deal in a group of friends but I still wanted to share it. 

* Since I did not drink, two of my female friends who did not drink alcohol as well (different reasons) did hang out with me the entire night. They were a bit annoyed by their drunken boyfriends and truly enjoyed my sober company. And when you sit there with a girl at each of your side having some good laughs it attracts other girls as well. Therefor I had a bunch of flirts and winks directed to me which boosted my self-confidence to the max. (I am in a relationship so I do not care that much, still a nice feeling) The important experience I got from this is the following: I did realize that not only the smokers bond easy (which was my usual thought). The non addicts bond as well. And in a bigger group it should not be a huge deal to find some. (The girls who do not smoke or drink are often the ones who look for their skin or figure and are therefor the hotter ones. Do you share that experience?)

* I went out with a friend who wanted to talk with me about his new girlfriend. She isn't smoking so while smoking he told me he wants to stop for her, since she gets disgusted by his taste when kissing. I promised him to send him the link to Allen Carrs book.

* I did wake up at 7:30 (was back at 3 am) to my usual schedule, fully awake with a lot of energy and without a headache.

I feel really great and realize one positive effect after another. But one thing that is really important to me is this subreddit. Although I do not post that much and are a part of it since only a few days (A WEEK!!!! YEAAAH) it gives me something that I do need to pass that addiction: 

* the feeling of not being alone

and

* the share of experience with people who care

So this is some kind of a thank you.

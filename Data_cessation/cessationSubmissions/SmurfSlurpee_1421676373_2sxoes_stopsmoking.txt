I feel like I cannot function properly without nicotine.

I failed and started smoking on Thanksgiving, and I finally got back on my quit last Wednesday (badge update in process). 

It seems that every time I quit something goes wrong. Last time it was the clutch master going out. This time, I had a flat tire, and a flat donut, which I discovered as I was leaving for work yesterday.

Now, this morning, I drove my wife's car to work, which is nicer/newer than the car that has historically given me problems. As I'm pulling into the parking garage, I swiped the yellow cement pillar, leaving a 2 1/2 ft streak of yellow and hellfire on the side of her car.

It's only 7:05 a.m., where I'm at, and I'm already considering calling it quits on this quit. I'm extremely frustrated, right now, and wish I wasn't at work so I could relax and deal with this appropriately.

I guess I'm mostly just looking for motivation to keep going with my quit. You guys are awesome, and I appreciate the help I've had in the past from reading your posts and comments.

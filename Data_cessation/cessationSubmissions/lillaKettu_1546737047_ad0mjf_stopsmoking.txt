Cravings ...

I've done well for one week, haven't really thought about it too much to be honest .  And now out of the blue I'm having a really bad craving for a cigarette.
I'm not even sure why. Maybe I just don't want to care for a second? 
Anyway I haven't caved in but if I'm starting to get these kinds of cravings all the time I don't know how I will handle it. 
Its been a weird day and a lot is going on. I hope I have a better mindset tomorrow.

Just came by to encourage you guys and say hi.

Hello,

I stopped smoking year and a half ago(I deleted app since I stopped). I just wanted to say thank you for all support. Now I am living a better and healthy life.

Now that I remember how stupid I was for doing my first puff then first cigarete and in no time I was smoking pack a day.

You should not let that stuff to dictate your lifestyle. To feel like a lower class citizen and be put in some kind of box where you can smoke.

"Hell" phase is the worst and when you pass it you will feel somehow relieved that it ended. But never underestimate next week(i got burned first and second time i stopped). After that it all gets better and you just need self control. 

If you are out drinking order 2 drinks and have both your hands full whole time that way you won't miss anything in hands and also try to hang out in non smoking bars if you can 

Thank you again guys and stay strong YOU can do it :)

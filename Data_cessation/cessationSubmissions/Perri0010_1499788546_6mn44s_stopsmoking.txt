if you smoke shisha once then quit, how long until you heal?

i dislike smoking. ive never done it and will never do it again. however in an attempt to exposure therapy myself to my hatred to it, i smoked a lot of shisha for about an hour and actually overdosed a bit. fell down and im still feeling sick right now.

how long until im as healthy as a non-smoker? cheers!

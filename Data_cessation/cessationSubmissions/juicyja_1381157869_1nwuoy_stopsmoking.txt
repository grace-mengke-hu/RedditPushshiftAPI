10 Months Today! You can do it to!

Edit: I stand by my poor grammar in the title!

I spent 10 years as a half a pack a day smoker. I got sick of getting winded walking up stairs and feeling like an old man so I started running. After a year of running and smoking, I got sick of the smoking holding my running back so I quit. No patches, e-cigs, or "big books," just willpower, a bunch of gum, and this sub when I needed support.

At first I worried about the thought of quitting forever, but eventually, I went a whole hour without thinking about cigarettes, then a day, and now I've lost count. It just isn't a part of my life.

I can smell shit I forgot had smells, I'm having the best sex of my life, and my whole outlook on life has shifted. 

Best of all I'm running the Chicago marathon on Sunday! 

I don't know why I posted this. Just patting myself on the back I guess. Thanks /r/stopsmoking!

I'm a heavy smoker for 7 years. Please tell me how to beat the addiction?

As the title implies, I want to quit smoking. I tried quitting a few years back but I relapsed after about a year of no smoking. Now that I'm 25 years old and about to compete in amateur boxing, I decided that I need to quit. So can anyone share any advices on quitting for good? Thanks!

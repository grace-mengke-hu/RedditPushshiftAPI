Done with smoking. It's gotta stick this time.

So, this is the third time this year that I am trying to quit. I tried back in March and was doing really well, but then I went home for a visit in May and a lot of my family smoked and I fell right back into it. Tried again in July, but it was a half-assed attempt and it didn't take long to relapse. I've been taking it back for a while. Lately, I've only been having two or three a day at work, and none at home.

I'm currently in Korea and heading back to the States in a few weeks and I had already sworn that I would quit before I got back, no matter what. I'll be visiting home for a couple weeks, but I've learned that all the smokers in the family there quit recently. That should help. I just can't keep smoking.

It's been difficult to quit. I've tried the patches. I have an e-cig. It helps, but isn't perfect. The strange thing is I enjoy smoking while I'm doing it, but towards the end, and afterword, all I can think of is "Bleh. I can't stand this." That's actually a step up. Before, I didn't think like that, so this will, hopefully, help in the beginning.

I have asthma and I'm just tired of smoking. I really need to pull this off. I don't want another cig. A part of me wants to use e-cigs, and a part of me wants to go cold turkey and just get over the nicotene, now. Just don't want to be stressed & take it out on my wife when I get back to the US in a few weeks.

Either way I do it, I have to stop smoking real cigs. I don't want to do it, anymore. Starting today. Anyway, just wanted to say hi. Sorry for the wall of text.

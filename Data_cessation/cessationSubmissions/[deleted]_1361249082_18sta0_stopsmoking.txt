Hey Reddit, I may have some advice for you.

I've tried to quit smoking over a dozen times, using so many different techniques, all from reputable sources, but absolutely none of them worked, so now I am on week 2 of no smoking and this is how I did it:

I didn't really think about anything, all I did was say no.
I didn't think about the future, because to be honest, the thought of never smoking again actually scared me.
I didn't think of any reasons why I should stop, because I didn't want to think about it, just when it came down to it, I simply said no, and moved on.
When I would walk past the cigarette section in the super market, I just said no, I didn't think of any consequences, I didn't think about anything.

This has really worked for me, I managed to quit cold turkey with some ease, maybe it will work for one of you guys

Good luck and don't give up guys! (well do, ehh you know what I mean)

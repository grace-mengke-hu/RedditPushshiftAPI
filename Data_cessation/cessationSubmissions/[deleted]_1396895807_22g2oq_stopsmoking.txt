Sick after quitting?

So I've been quit for almost 2 months now and it seems like I've caught every cold that's been going around since then. I've caught a sore throat bug, an ear infection and with the latest one, I can't stop sneezing and my nose is running constantly. Claritin doesn't help, so it isn't allergies. Is this normal? Is it even related to quitting or is it just bad luck?

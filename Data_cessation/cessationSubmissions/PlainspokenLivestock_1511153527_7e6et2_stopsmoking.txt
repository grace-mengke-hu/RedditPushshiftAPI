A star badge means 1 month tobacco free! And a medal to boot!

Got a participation medal after completing an obstacle course race - the obstacles were challenging but doable, it was the cardio that was a bitch. With every painful breath, I was thankful that I quit smoking a month ago and not a day later.

I still get SOB at odd times, usually at night, while sitting or lying down. Looking forward to that stopping at some point.

And tomorrow is my first big challenge: drinks with friends who smoke. But I feel strong, and in this moment right now, I have absolutely no desire to smoke whatsoever.

Thanks to this sub for the good reads, the reminders of the need to be vigilant, and the continuing support!

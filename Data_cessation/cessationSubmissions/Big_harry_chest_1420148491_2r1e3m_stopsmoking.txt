Anyone who has tried to quit!

So I quit smoking in April! I was stoked when I was able to hike without losing my breath! But a few weeks into quitting I had some horrible side effects. I couldn't eat anything without immediately having to use the bathroom! Instant diarrhea was constant! My stomach was in knots! I actually went to the doctor to find out I had gotten internal  hemorrhoids when I had bright red blood in the toilet bowl! It was horrible. I'm sad to say that a few weeks ago I picked smoking back up. But all the symptoms have stopped! No stomach in knots. No more instant diarrhea. This just makes me want to quit even more! But how do I handle the issues after I kick the habit. Any ideas will be helpful! Thanks
And happy new year!

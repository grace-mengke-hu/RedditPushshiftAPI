Been smoking for the past 9 years, quitted last month but now I'm having different issues

Hello reddit and thanks for reading!

I've quitted smoking last month after 9 years of intense smoking, this is the first time I'm trying and it's going pretty well except for one small detail.

I've always been a very nervous person, I've play a lot of games and I usually get mad for losing or doing bad, this was never a big issue since I was able to handle it decently. but since I left this is getting a little bit out of hand. 

it's happening for everything, work, social relationships, games, favours. It's happening quite often and I feel like I'm not improving but going the other way, Like i've transformed myself into a worse person. 

I know that smoking is not the answer but I do not know WHY is this exactly happening.

Is the lack of smoking that is turning me into an annoying idiot?
Is it me and smoking 'covered' this issue?
Is it ever going away?

Any help is appreciated.

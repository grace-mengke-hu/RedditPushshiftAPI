Help!

So a little back story. I smoked for two years, was sick after my morning one and then that was that for two years. 
Moved to a new country where I am surrounded by cigarette smoke all the time and with them being so cheap, I buckled. 
I can't use an e-cigarette as they are illegal here. I tried patches (bad rashes), lozenges (heart burn), gum (feels like my throat is closing up, burping and nausea) and pain conditioning with an elastic band around my wrist (goes out the window when I have alcohol). 
Feel so shitty that I can seem to kick it this time, does anyone have any advice?

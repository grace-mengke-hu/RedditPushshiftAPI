It's crazy looking back this far away from smoking now. All of the cravings gone. All of the muscle memory gone. All of the pre-planning any situations I would be in so that I could find smoke breaks, gone. If you are new here and ready to stop, I want you to know that you can. I read Allen Carr's book and quit cold turkey at the end of it. Whatever path you take to get there, I want you to know that there is life after smoking, and it is so good.

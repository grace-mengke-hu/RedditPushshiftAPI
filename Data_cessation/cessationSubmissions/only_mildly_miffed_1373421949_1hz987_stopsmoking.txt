Just quit. Need help. Lots of help.

I haven't had a cigarette since Saturday afternoon. I was doing great until a little while ago. I have a head-splitting migraine, I'm so bitchy I'm even starting to intimidate myself and I feel like I just noticed a 10 pound weight gain. I'm committed to quit, but is this normal? Should I expect this to get better or worse over the next few days?

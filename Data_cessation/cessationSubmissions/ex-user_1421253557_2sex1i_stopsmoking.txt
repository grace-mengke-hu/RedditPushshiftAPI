Why I stay subscribed (and quit)

Every once in a while I think that I remember enjoying smoking. And I get that tiny gnawing voice that says I could or should. But when I see posts from the person that is struggling, I remember what That is like instead. I don't ever want to feel that again. If I can ignore the tiny nagging then I never again have to endure the agony and compulsion of being addicted. Thanks for everything, /r/stopsmoking!

Its been 4 days. Feeling positive!

I'm 24 and have been smoking since I was 16. Bought myself a vape pen and its been 4 days since my last cig. Feeling great and have no desire to buy a pack of smokes. I've tried quitting a couple times but this time it feels different. Really looking forward to completely eliminating the habit. All these stories on this subreddit really help too! Keep it up guys! Lets do this together!

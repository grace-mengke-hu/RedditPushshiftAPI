One week today and I really really want a cigarette

Maybe I could just get a pack of those cheap cigarillos, right? They're not much more than a dollar, the price is justified, I could just have one and save the other two for another occasion. It's just a treat, I mean I've lasted a week haven't I? 

Hell, why not just get a pack. I'll get something fancy, like American Spirits. They're my favorite and since I'm not smoking anymore I can justify that price. They'll taste a lot better than the cigarillos, and because they're expensive I'll spread them out for longer and have more treats, right? Right?

But gah! I've been doing so good. So fucking good. I even cut back on the drinking. The day I quit I started working out and haven't stopped. I tried earlier to lift weights and forget about that nicotine tugging gently on my pant leg, but it just never goes away and I'm already so sore and tired. My lungs though, my lungs feel great.

Why can't I just not want you, cigarettes? Why can't I just tell you to fuck off. Every time I buy a pack it's my last pack, always a regret. I know I only smoke a pack or two a week, it's not much, but I know how this goes, it always devolves into a pack a day habit. I know the cravings will go away once I get it out of my head that I'm a smoker, but right now I feel like a smoker and I really want a smoke.

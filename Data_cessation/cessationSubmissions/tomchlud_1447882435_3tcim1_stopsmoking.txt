8 days in and now come the real problem...

My girlfriend wants to make out all the time... My life is fucking amazing and I can't believe I wasted nearly 10 years of it on a chemical.  I'm not out of the woods yet, but hell week faded uneventfully into heck week yesterday after more than a year of lurking.  Those of you who are year + quitters that stick around to encourage us quitlings are amazing and I always look for your comments on this sub. Thank you guys. 

Someone slap a badge on my name and let's get this show on the road!

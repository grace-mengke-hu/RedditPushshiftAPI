Girlfriend wants me to quit, but I'm really not feeling it

I know that smoking is bad, and I know that I should probably quit, but I just don't have that inner drive to really dedicate myself to stop. All of my friends smoke, and I've always had a good time just shooting the shit with them. It'd be difficult to quit hanging out with them. Thoughts?

Edit: Yeah, fuck it. Quitting cold turkey.

Be Strong guys! Stopped after 4 years of smoking a pack a day!

I cannot believe that I am about to hit 93 days without a smoke. I have the weakest willpower, and somehow I powered through first 20 days, and after that, it got easier every day. I still get cravings from time to time, but they are something that can be brushed aside! Somethings I learned from my past mistakes:
* Never vape(even for once), although it helps a lot of people, for me it was a vicious cycle between vape and cigarettes. 
* keep clove handy! It mimics the burn to some extent, and helps with the cravings
* Don't expect it to be life transforming. It is life transforming on a long-term basis. 
* Don't romanticize smoking. I used to see a beautiful view or meet an old friend whom I used to smoke with and romanticize smoking. It always has been my tipping point to start smoking.

My strategy always was to quit on a Friday, sleep all weekend, and by the time its time to go to work, you already have 3 days of a headstart!

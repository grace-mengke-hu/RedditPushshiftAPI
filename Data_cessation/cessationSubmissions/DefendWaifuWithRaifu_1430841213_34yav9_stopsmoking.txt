Card got declined, decided to take it as a sign

Must have mis-balanced my checkbook, but when I went to the store to grab smokes, the card was declined. Oh well I say, I'll just transfer  money out of my hard earned savings account. Then I really thought about it. That's my savings! What I have to my name and I'm going to burn it all away? No thanks. Took it as an opportunity. Dug out the Vape (I need something or it will not work simple as that) and the journey begins again. Reading some of the posts on here makes me feel like these feelings of "thinking i'm going to miss it forever" are possible to beat. 

Biggest worry is my after meal smoke and my after drink smoke

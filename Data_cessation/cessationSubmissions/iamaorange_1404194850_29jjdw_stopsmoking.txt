Quit smoking, but it feels like i have a lump in my throat

I quit smoking actual cigarettes at the end of may and have been using an e cig up until a week ago. I never smoked a lot of cigarettes, maybe 1 or 2 a day, 3 if i was lucky, but i heavily used my e-cig. Like at least a couple draws every 15 minutes on average throughout the entire day. I used the 24 milligram bottles. I quit cold turkey from that a little over a week ago and I'm feeling good. The only problem is that It feels like I have a lump in my throat. Also I've been smoking for about a year and half and I'm 18. Any help on how to get rid of this lump and id be grateful.

Day 9

It's been over a week gradually reducing the amount that I use my Nicorette Spray to 1-2 a day when feeling stressed. At the end of this week I will drop it entirely and just get the last of the nicotine out of my system.

Beyond that feeling pretty good day to day. Don't feel as tempted to go out and smoke and been getting more active. 

Just thought I would check in and best of luck to all of you today.

Hour 3: What now?

I lost my tobacco pouch at uni today, and thought. "Fuck it, I'll try quitting" . 

Paid a few bucks for an app to tell me what a good boy I am. I'm a singer and I like run. Smoking doesn't help either of those things. So I guess the thing is: What now? Do I throw out all my lighters, filter and papers? What do I do in the morning when I make my coffee, when I finish a class, when I go for a beer, when I get in my car, or when I finish a meal? I'm concerned for when cravings get intense. I've smoked for about 7 years, about 10 a day, sometimes way more, not often less.
Advice guys? Should I see a doc or a counsellor? What did y'all do that took your mind off really wanting a cigarette?

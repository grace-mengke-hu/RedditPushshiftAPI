1 week in. Getting easier.

So yeah. A week ago yesterday, I smoked my last cigarette. I have quit twice before (once for about a year..but got caught in the "drink and a smoke" trap) and again for about 6 weeks with patches, but dumped the patches and started again because of a sudden, extremely stressful situation. 

This time, I'm determined to quit for good. I am using the CVS brand patches this time around and honestly I don't think they're working like Nicoderm CQ. When I was on those patches I had no cravings until the last week when I was on the tiny 2mg/day patches. Honestly, the CVS patches were only appealing because they were like $25.00/7 days and it was buy one get one 50% off.. But the trade off is this past week has been sheer hell, seems like every time I turn around I'm having a craving. 

I've really had to push hard to not want a cigarette. I've found popping a couple altoids or chewing some gum helps but I can't do that all the time. I am sure it's going to get better soon. 

I'm already feeling my lung capacity coming back, so that's good. And, I've actually LOST weight because we're also doing the diet and exercise thing..So yay!

I just wish I could knock down these cravings...

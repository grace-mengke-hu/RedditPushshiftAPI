Cant stop wont stop

Can you stop? Sure you can. Who dies from smoking? Not you!  You're going to be unscathed by smoking. The other people are the unlucky ones, not you! Too bad they didn't quit in time! You're so smart. You're going to stop before it affects your health! Why didn't they stop before it affected their health? They must not have been as smart as you. 

You are the "others"
You are the "they"
You are the "them"
You.

100 Hours, 100% Nausea

So it has been 100 hours since my last cigarette, and yesterday I was feeling great, I mean really great. I walked a couple miles to university and back, I could smell stuff, and it was great.

This morning though, Christ this morning. My day starts with a stabbing pain on the left side of my chest which got worse when I tried to sit up. It did eventually go away but I've been left feeling nauseous all day. The kind of nausea where you're gagging over your sink. I am coughing a lot, but having a cough was what spurred me to give up in the first place.

Is this normal? Is it going to go away soon? My insides feel like they're on fire, and I've burped my way through the alphabet like 10 times. I have an E-cig but I'm not sure if this is going to make it better or worse, HELP MEH!

9 months smoke free and it feels so easy now

Smoker of 10 years, quit 9 months ago and now I can’t believe I ever smoked before. I never have cravings anymore, never miss smoking, never want one anymore. Here’s a summary of my craving history:

First days: cravings were really rough and I had to actively distract myself with activities

3 months in: my new nonsmoking lifestyle became routine. Still had cravings when partaking in activities where I used to smoke especially while driving (always smoked while stuck in traffic)

6 months in: No more cravings while driving, but I noticed cravings would come at the weirdest of times, times when I never smoked, like brushing my teeth. But even then, cravings were light and easily ignored. 

9 months in: I never have cravings anymore. I have no interest in cigarettes and they frankly gross me out! 


I’d like to point out that every persons journey is unique and there’s nothing wrong with having cravings at any stage of quitting. And I wouldn’t be discouraged if I were to ever experience a craving again—I’m almost certain I will. Cravings are good reminders that the fight is real and to keep up your guard. 

But with that said, I’d like anyone who is curious or trying to quit to know that it does get better! And while addiction might not be “cured”, it is totally beatable. 

TL;DR Cigarettes will not weigh on your mind forever and cravings will go away!

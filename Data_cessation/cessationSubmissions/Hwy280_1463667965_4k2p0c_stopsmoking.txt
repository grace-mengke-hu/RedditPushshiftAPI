500 Days, Today.

Proud of myself for getting this far after smoking for about 13 years. I think I can finally say I'm done with cigarettes for good. The catalysts for me to quit were:

1. Allen Carr's book
2. whyquit.com

Both of which I discovered through this subreddit. whyquit.com is an ugly website and I didn't read all of it, but the thing that really affected me was reading the stories of smokers who died young. I'm a parent of two toddlers, and it hit me so hard how much I want to be around for my kids as long as possible. After that I never looked back.

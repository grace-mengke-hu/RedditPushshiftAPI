Withdrawal side effects.

First time poster here. I recently quit on June 3rd. Wish I could be more proud of myself but I have quit for up to a year, maybe two (I forget), before and still started back. Still this time I have gone cold turkey. No gum, patches, ecigs. 

I know a sore throat is a common but for how long I am unsure. 

My question is that when I quit my acid reflux/GERD symptoms seem to worsen. Is this a common side effect of withdrawing from cigarettes? Will it subside or is this just my normal self?

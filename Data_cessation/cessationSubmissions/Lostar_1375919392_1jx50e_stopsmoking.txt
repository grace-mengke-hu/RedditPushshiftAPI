Holy shit this is hard.

So I'm almost at 2 days. I'm anxious as fuck. My head is all sparks and weirdness and my temper has gone to nearly nothing. Really trying to quit, I've tried 3 or 4 times, but all have failed after the 6 or 7 day mark. This time I'm trying Lobelia Inflata and Rescue Remedy to manage symptoms. Any other ideas?

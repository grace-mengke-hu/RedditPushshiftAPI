20 Days and Still going strong

Can't believe it's been 20 days and I didn't even smoked a puff of a cigarette, had some very bad and stressful days in between but I just didn't let go of this promise I made to myself of 20 days ago. I just want to see this score grow now. No turning back. And just to motivate the people who are deciding to quit, I don't crave for cigarettes anymore. It's only one week you gotta make through and after that everyday will be the easier one. I don't think about cigarettes anymore. I am extra conscious about my health and diet and skin and hair now. Man I can breathe and smell and taste too. Thanks a lot all you beautiful people out here for helping me get out of this shitty habit.

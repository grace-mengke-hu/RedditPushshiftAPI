My day 3 excruciating craving

I am currently on day 14. My day 3 by far the worst. I woke up "wanting" a smoke. I ate breakfast around 8:30. I had a fit from 9:00 to 2:00. It was excruciating. I couldn't focus. I felt like if only I took one puff I would have the focus needed to be productive during the day. My brain was telling my body all sorts of things to try to light up. Luckily we have that other part of our brain. The voluntary side. It said non smokers don't have a lack of concentration nor do smokers have an edge over non smokers. This feeling will pass. I am now on day 14. I don't have this long drawn out cravings. Day 3 was a bitch, until I made it my bitch.

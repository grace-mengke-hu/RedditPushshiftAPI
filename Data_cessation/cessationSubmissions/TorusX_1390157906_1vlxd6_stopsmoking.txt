I'm like 50/50 on caving in.

So i am 1 month 20 days and 16 hours no cigarette. i am almost 3 weeks no nicotine at all(i was using an e-cig and gum). i just need to hear people say they feel just as shitty as i do. I don't have cravings necessarily, but the majority of my days so far i just feel semi depressed and I'm getting pains all over. Should i still feel nauseated at times? I mean when i'm not, i'm eating like crazy. But these few times i get this feeling in my throat(not to mention tension in the muscles even in the front) but it feels like i could puke but i know that feeling when im screwed and its gunna happen and it isn't it. i have no problems swallowing or breathing(had an occasional weird feeling while breathing but i'm sure that was due to the cleaning in my lungs and has almost ceased.) I also quit weed back in November(you don't even wanna know how much I smoked a day). To top it all of, my mom passed away last January and my Doc said that with the weed i may have suppressed all my grieving with weed so she said on top of all this my body is probably grieving now along with the no smoking so its like overkill. Part of me just wants to smoke again to see if some of the symptoms would go away and the other half doesn't want to start the process over again...help

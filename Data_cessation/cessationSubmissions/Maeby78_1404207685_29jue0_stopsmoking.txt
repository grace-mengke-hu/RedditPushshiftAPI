Something else I didn't see coming when I quit.

My mouth tastes horrible when I wake up.

 I could mill around for an hour or more after waking up as a smoker, but when I wake up now, my mouth is awful. 

Is it because my taste buds work better now that I don't smoke?  Maybe morning mouth tastes awful because I can taste it now?  

My mouth is awful in the morning now that I don't smoke, and I expected the opposite.

You know what feels great?

Your 3 yr anniversaryüòâ


All your posts helped. When someone said they relapsed hard after a few months and had to start all over again, I really took their pain to heart and learned from it. When I talked about my own struggles and someone related to it I felt the courage to keep putting up a good fight.


Looking back I thought the hardest part of quitting is the fact that you might fail or relapse at some point down the road. I don't feel like thats an option for me anymore. I don't have to put up a battle because my noggin has a collection of posts from this community to look back on and remember "ah yes, smoking is a bad idea and I wont do it." Plus if I fail I have to restart my counter! 


So really, thank you. Whoever you are. What you're going through now helps me to keep going and the support offered here is impecible. I wouldn't have been able to get this far without you. It was really hard at first but you DO get to a point where it's not hard at all and its a glorious feeling. ‚ù§


I'm wishing you all the best!

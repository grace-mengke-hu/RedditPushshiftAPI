Can't get past the self defeating thoughts when trying to quit.

So my problem is every time I say I'm going to quit I get to one hour without a smoke then these thoughts pop up: "oh my god what am I doing what if the withdrawal is so bad I can't go to work or what if I'm at work without cigarettes how will I get through the day? How am I going to leave the house without cigarettes and I get a panic attack from not smoking? What if this is the worst withdrawl I've ever had to go through in my life and I can't handle it? What if what if what if" and while that's going through my mind I'm already speed walking to the gas station to Buy a carton . I have tried to quit once before and the first 24 hours were brutal so much so that I couldn't picture myself going another day, let alone 2 weeks of withdrawl, so that quit was very short lived. But that was when I was only smoking half a pack a day and if that was hell, I can't imagine trying to quit a pack a day which is what I currently smoke. I have read Allen Carr and that didn't really do much for me. I'm hoping anyone here can share some thoughts or suggestions that will ease my mind about quitting because right now quitting is terrifying me.

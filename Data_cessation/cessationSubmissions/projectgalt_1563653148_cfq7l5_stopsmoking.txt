Paying your friend to quit?

Hi all! I'm a former smoker. I've recently been trying to get my twin brother to quit as well. He won't try counseling and doesn't really care for Nicorette products/patches etc.  The other day I mentioned if I could, I would pay him to quit - he laughed, then said he'd think about it. Has anyone else thought about literally paying a friend/family member to quit? How would you even monitor it..? and did it work lol

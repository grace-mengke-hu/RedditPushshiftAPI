Day 2. Pushing forward.

I began my journey 2 days ago. Day 1 was easy, due to a hangover and sore throat. Day 2 is hell. Time is going slowly, very slowly. I am feeling ....defeated. I don't know if I am handling this right, but I got a pack in plain site. I stare at it and say, "You could smoke, but you choose not to." It makes it easier. I guess I'm just here looking for support or tips. Or just someone to chat with during these cravings.

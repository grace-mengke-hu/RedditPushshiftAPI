Anxiety

So I quit about a month ago, Septmeber 17th.  And my anxiety is THROUGH THE ROOF.  Even when I'm not craving things or worried about anything in particular, I'll wake up and throughout the day feel anxious/on edge, can't focus, etc.  It's gotten so bad at times i have to remove myself abruptly from social situations so i can calm down.  I also recently started a new relationship in the mean time (stress increasing anxiety about performance/libido) but i feel like that anxiety is adding to my withdrawal symptoms.  

Anyone know how to the difference between quitting withdrawal/anxiety is how it affect life stressors?  I can't seem to think straight.  Am I still in withdrawal induced anxiety or is anxiety just a larger problem i have to now deal with since i don't smoke anymore?  I've started trying to eat right, started using caffeine only when i need it, and I've started working out more including cardio plus weights.

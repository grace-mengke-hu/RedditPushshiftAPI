hello. live from day 10.

this whole thing has been a lot easier than i thought it would be. for that, i suppose i'm lucky.

day 1 was e-cig day. determined that it was a waste of money.

day 2 and day 3 were hungry days. just famished.

day 4 and day 5 were smoking dreams days. packs consumed in my sleep.

since day 6, it has kind of been a non-issue. i watched a movie the other night with a lot of smoking in it, and kinda salivated a little. but actual cravings, not really. 

i'm eating a bit more than i did before, but weight has stayed steady. 

i'm really proud of myself.

i'd love to tell my parents, but they didn't exactly know that i had been smoking for years in the first place. 

my friends are proud tho. and i'm proud, which is most important.

tasting things is pretty sweet.

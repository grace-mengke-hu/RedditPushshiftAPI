If I can do it, you can too

Started smoking at 15-16, and by my late teens I was a pack-a-day smoker. This was back when smoking was still thought to look edgy and cool rather than just trashy and disgusting, and you could buy a pack or Marlboros for $2 in quarters right out of a machine in almost any diner. I loved smoking, it was a major part of my look and personality, and nobody I know could have imagined me back then and throughout pretty much my entire adult life as a non smoker.

Fast forward to last year, 41 years old going on 42, almost 25 years as a pack a dayer and I quit cold turkey on Halloween. Did the first few days suck? Yep. Tiredness, gastrointestinal upset, anxiety. Was it hard for weeks afterward? Yep. For maybe a month I had this chronic feeling like I’d forgotten my keys or something. 

Today though I don’t miss the habit at all except for those few times after a big meal or whatever when I think “I’d love a smoke,” but I know my choice isn’t one cig or none. It’s being a non smoker vs smoking until it kills me.

If I knew how easy it would be in hindsight I would have quit decades ago.

Congrats to all of you who quit. Nobody here is going to miss it. And for those of you trying to quit trust me: If I could do it you absolutely can!

Stay strong my friends.

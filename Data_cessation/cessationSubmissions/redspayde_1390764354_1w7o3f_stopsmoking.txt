Self Respect

I've been lurking here for the past week and seriously debating if I should quit. After reading a post on /r/nofap about how this whole quitting thing comes down to the strength of your word, which is the foundation of self-respect. I knew I had to make a move.

It's completely true. Every drag I take, I know in my heart that it is killing me, I know that I'm literally burning money that can go to my student loans, I know that it conflicts with every goal I could ever have in this life. And every time I ever tried to quit or said I was going to quit tomorrow and did not do so. I devalued the strength of my word.

So now I quit. Today is day 1. I am not going to devalue my word. Hopefully with a little support from this amazing community.

Good luck to everyone else out there!

Just needed to get this off my chest.

It's been 169 days since I had a smoke and I hardly have any urges these days.  I think I am almost qualified to call myself a 'non-smoker' but I wanted to share a feeling that I have about smoking.  Sometimes I still kind of miss smoking, I mean, that quiet time, sitting in my armchair outside and relaxing, felt like a time of contemplation and meditation.  Especially after dinner, I used to sit outside look at the stars and have a smoke.  I won't lie to you, I used to love it and I miss that feeling.  It's not about the cigarettes or nicotine but it's about having a good time with myself.  No way, I am going back to smoking but I just wanted to get this off my chest.  I hate to have that kind of feeling in my mind.  I don't like to have any kind of attachment towards smoking, I want to get rid of that too.  

Does any of you have such a feeling?  If yes, how do you deal with it?  I think this is the only remaining thing that I have to get rid of regarding smoking.  Kindly let me know your thoughts on this.

Thank You.

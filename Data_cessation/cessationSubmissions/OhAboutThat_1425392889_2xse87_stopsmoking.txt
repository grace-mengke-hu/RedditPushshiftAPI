This might be a little too soon, but quitting cigarettes has forced me to be sober.

For the past eight years the most I've ever been sober (be it alcohol, weed, or other things) was maybe a whole day. I also smoked half a pack-a whole pack a day, depending on how sober I wasn't. I never went to clubs/raves/bars and I could keep a friends for a few months at the most. I usually sat in my room watching netflix, because I didn't really have the brain power to do anything else. It was a deep dark hole, and I cried almost everyday. Some how I managed to maintain a 3.2 gpa, and I'm about to graduate. I honestly don't understand or remember what I'm suppose to have learned from these 5 years in college. But I'll deal with that later I suppose. But for the past FOUR days I haven't smoked (anything), drank, or popped any pills and I feel WONDERFUL and terrible at the same time. I can breathe, I can think clearly (mostly), I realize it wasn't the drugs and I actually need glasses, and I also realized I like me as a person. I had Saturday off work and instead of getting high and watching netflix I listening to NPR, crocheted, and read a newspaper. I'm an old person at heart and I freakin love it. The only problem is, I feel completely alone again. I can't have my dog (whole different story), all my friends and **family** pressure me into getting high and smoking and I just don't know. I need sober friends. Thanks for reading my rant.

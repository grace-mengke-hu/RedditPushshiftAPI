Nearly three weeks and stressing..

They say you hit a bump after three weeks and it's hard again - I hope I can be strong and make it through. On the smoke-free app we have to post what has helped so far, for me it's: MUSIC - listening to music calmed me down and got me through the first three days; exercise - walking or going to gym helps a lot; eating healthy food - snacking on fruit and nuts and drinking lots of Rooibos tea.  But the problem is I am snacking a bit too much, chips and chocolate too.

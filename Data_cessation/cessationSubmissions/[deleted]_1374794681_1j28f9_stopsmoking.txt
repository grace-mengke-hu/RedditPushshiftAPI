Days are passing by, and the cravings are as well.

2 weeks into this journey and going strong. I am around two smokers yet I have resisted the urge to smoke. Cigarettes actually smell bad to me now. It's really weird! I still miss having one after dinner, in the morning...you know? Those cigarettes you'd have at certain times of the day? Not the ones in between. Oh well cigarettes, I am smoke free now!

What were your worst symptoms when quitting?

I (22F) am trying to prepare myself for my quit day on December 13th at 4PM. Why so far away? My final exam of the semester is on this day from 1:30-3:30. This day is also 1 week before a surgery where easier/faster recovery means no smoking. 

I have tried to quit by vape in the past with no luck. I think that the only way I will kick my addiction is cold turkey.

I want to quit. I've wanted to quit for at least a year. However, I have general anxiety and health anxiety, meaning I worry that the smallest changes in how my body feels is cause for concern. I think the easiest way for me to feel at ease about any symptoms I will face by quitting is hearing your worst symptoms that you experienced physically. If you have anxiety, I would also appreciate hearing how bad it was while quitting. I want to hear all the bad, worse, and horrible so that if it happens to me, I will know it's just because I'm quitting smoking.

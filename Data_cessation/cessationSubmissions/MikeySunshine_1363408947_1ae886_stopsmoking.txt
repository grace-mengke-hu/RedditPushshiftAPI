A small victory...

Ten days into my cold turkey quit. 10-year smoker since the age of 19. 

Pulled into a parking spot at the local Mexican foodery and I saw a man exit his truck with a lit cigarette hanging from his mouth. For the first time ever I didn't think to myself, "Man, I'd really enjoy one of those," but instead, "That's disgusting." Instead of fantasizing about the act of smoking, I remembered the uncomfortable burning sensation of having a flaming stick of garbage in my mouth.

My family and girlfriend all think I quit a lot longer ago than ten days. Thank you, redditors, for being here to share in my wins.

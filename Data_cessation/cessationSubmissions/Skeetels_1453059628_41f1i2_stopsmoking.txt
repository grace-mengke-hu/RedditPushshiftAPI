Quitting with a Vape

For the past year I have been a five cigarette a day smoker, mostly rolling my own american spirits (probably doesn't make a difference but thought I would throw it in there) and as of this morning I am 80 hours deep into no smoking.  Day 3 was the hardest, but today is better although I still feel edgy.  I have been using a vape with 3mg's of nicotine to help with the withdrawal and was wondering  if that is doing more harm than good.  Is giving my body such a small dose of nicotine going to prolong my withdrawals and just make it worse or will my  body slowly get used to just having such a small amount of nicotine?  Hopefully this made sense.  I've been a little off for that past few days.

First day. So many triggers...

Today was miserable. Just plain miserable. There were so many triggers, before lunch, after lunch, after dinner, after running... I didn't give in a single time and I thought I was doing great until my biggest trigger kicked in, which is when I go at midnight for a light snack (I knew this was going to be a trigger and didn't plan on going out today. But since I didn't eat anything today since 3pm, I was really hungry and I went out for dinner, not a snack). Honestly, if I had enough money after my dinner, I would have bought a pack. I can feel my willpower slowly slipping away, but I am determined to get through this. 

/r/stopsmoking, what helped you get through the first week? How did you deal with your cravings? I heard from some people that the cravings stop, and from others that they don't, so I guess it differs from person to person. I hope they stop for me...

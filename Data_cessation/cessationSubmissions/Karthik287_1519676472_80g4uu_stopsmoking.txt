Revisiting Allen Carr

5 months and 8 days. Most days smoking is at most a fleeting thought. Some days its a bit more but nothing compared to the first 3 days, 3 weeks and 3 months. Once in a while, say once a month, the idea of "why not take up smoking again?" pops into my head but I've never actually gone through with it. Today is one of those days where it doesn't seem like such a bad idea and I'm thinking I need to revisit Allen Carr's book again. That usually works for me. I just don't want to have to deal with this anymore. When does this end as well?

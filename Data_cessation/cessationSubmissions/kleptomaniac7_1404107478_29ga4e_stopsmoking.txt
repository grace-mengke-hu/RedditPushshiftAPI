Quitting by cutting back

Hello everyone,

I'm currently trying to quit. I used to smoke about 15-18 cigarettes per day. I started smoking when I was 18 and I am now 2 months shy of my 24th. For the last 3 weeks, I have cut back from 15-18 to about 5-10. What I do is I set a timer on my phone for 2 hours. Every two hours I will have one, and then immediately reset the timer for another 2. My question is this: Will quitting by cutting back reduce the chances of me getting sick once I've quit fully? I plan on being smoke free by mid-end of August. 

In terms of other factors, I eat very healthy and I drink about 4L (~a gallon) of water every single day. I eat plenty of active-culture plain yogurt and I have maybe one glass of whiskey a month. No pop, sugary drinks, my coffee is only black and I do weight training 3 times a eek and yoga twice a week. Based on all of this, how "should" I fare when it comes to side effects of quitting?

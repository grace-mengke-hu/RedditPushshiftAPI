Cravings are driving me insane. I have a hard time focusing on doing anything. Also my insomnia is getting worse

Even though I'm chewing 30 nicorette gums per day. Any tricks to lessen the cravings? Seriously I'm even thinking of getting drunk. 

I can't go back to smoking or vaping. My asthma is getting worse but I think I'm more addicted than the average person...

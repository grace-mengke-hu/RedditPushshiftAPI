Y'all are AMAZING!

I cannot express how completely AMAZING you all are for sharing your experiences, temptations, resolutions, advice - everything.  I am on Day 3, and it's like walking through wet cement most of the time combined with racing thoughts and anxiety.  So, super fun.  But, reading your stories really helps.  Knowing you are out there struggling along the same as I am, also helps.  Knowing that there will be days that breeze by, helps.  Knowing that there will be tough days and stupid dreams, helps.  Knowing that just by committing to this self-care instead of committing to self-destruction, I am showing myself more love than I have in a long time.  I didn't before, because I didn't think I deserved it.  Smoking was my passive-aggressive slow-motion suicide attempt.

So - Thank You to everyone here - whether you post or not.  I know you're here, struggling, achieving, trying, and doing better right along with me.  I couldn't do it without you.

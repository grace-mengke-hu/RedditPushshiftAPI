I made it to a year, Thanks everyone!

I never thought that after 22 years of smoking, I would be able to quit. I had my last smoke one year ago. What worked for me? I didn't read Alan Carr's book, but I used his ideas. I knew what I was doing was feeding an addiction. Now, I have never felt more free. Keep going, day one people. You can do it, too. Thanks, everybody!

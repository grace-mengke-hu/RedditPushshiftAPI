When do these crazy dreams die down?

Hi folks,

Hope you are all doing well and thank you for creating this community. I'm turning 30 this summer, have smoked since I was 21, been smoking about 5 packs a week for the last 2 - 3 years, and promised myself that I wouldn't quit on my birthday -- that I'd celebrate my birthday with some momentum.

I went cold turkey on June 3rd. I carry 2mg lozenges in the pocket where I used to carry my lighter, but for me it's like having a fire extinguisher in the kitchen and thus far I haven't used any.

Anyway, on to the question -- crazy crazy fucking dreams, every single night, especially at first. Has died down a bit, but then last night was a real rollercoaster. I'm dreaming about dead family members for some reason (not smoking-related deaths), and wish it would go away.

Any one have a perspective to share?

Thank you!

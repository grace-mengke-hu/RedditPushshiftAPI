Any other weekend smokers here?

I stopped smoking for 14 years and slid into it again 3 years ago when a close relative was dying - logical, eh?  In some ways I don’t feel like a ‘real’ smoker as I can stop most weeks.  Strangely, I find it just as hard cutting out the weekends.  It’s a constant battle which I have never won!!!Just wondered if anyone had a similar experience....

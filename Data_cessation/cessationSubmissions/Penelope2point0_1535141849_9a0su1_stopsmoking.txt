Working on my quit plan!

After trying and failing cold turkey a million times, I have been considering where I fall off the wagon. It always is because of habits I associate with smoking. 

So I decided this time I am going to try something different.  My official quit date is Sept 11th (my daughter's 18th birthday) so between now and then I have put on a low mg patch, and I am focusing on breaking the psychological habits associated with smoking first.  Even with the patch I still feel that urge..

so my biggest times to smoke are 

when i wake up - thankfully because of kids I have never smoked in the house, so I just need to not go outside!

While driving to and from work 

When it is quiet at work

I feel like if i do it this way I may help myself. (and if it doesnt work..fine tune and back to the drawing board)

since I am already a little on the neurotic/anxious side I want to focus on learning to cope before throwing myself into coping.

So far with this plan I have had 3 cigarettes in almost 24 hours vs a whole pack. To me that is good progress. 

suggestions for things to so while driving..and other times I would normally smoke? i have an ecig that is dead but i use it to mimic the hand mouth movement..

what did you all use? candy? lolipops? I don't chew gum, and I would love some suggestions that are sugar free!

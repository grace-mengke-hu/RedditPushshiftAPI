Three months smoke free! Finally quit all the way!

I'm not sure why, but around January of this year, smoking lost much of its appeal and I found myself going down over time from a pack a day to one or two cigarettes a day.  It was at this point that I decided to try eliminating it from my life altogether.  I'm sure it helped that I'd been making my own for about two years, as the tobacco you buy in bags doesn't have the chemical brew contained in commercial cigs that used to make me leave claw marks on the wall if I went without for so much as a few hours.

Anyway, after getting down to the point where I'd only smoke about one or two a week, I gave away my RYO gear, tobacco and tubes and told my husband not to give me any smokes even if I begged him.  Here it is, three months later, and I'm mostly done coughing up the shit from my lungs and have noticed some definite changes in my taste buds now that the tobacco isn't altering flavors anymore.  Can't eat BBQ chips anymore, but that's a small price to pay!

Best part about all this is that I don't even crave cigarettes anymore.  Went through a short period (about two weeks) when I'd desperately want one for about half an hour, but I found, oddly enough, that drinking pineapple juice stopped that craving.

Good luck to everyone who's trying to quit!  If I can do it, anyone can!

over 4 weeks!!

Can I just say that I am so happy to be a part of this group, and say that I have now not smoked a cigarette in over four weeks. My one question is my chest felt so much better up until like a day or two ago, it now kinda feels like I've been smoking which I haven't been. Is this the process of all of the shit that is in them from years of smoking working its way out? Well either way cannot explain how happy I am that I do not smoke anymore. Still have those cravings every once and a while, but have learned to live with them and get over them. Thanks guys.

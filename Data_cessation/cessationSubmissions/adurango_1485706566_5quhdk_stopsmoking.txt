So I finally stopped. It's been 3 weeks. More actually. How?

It wasn't the Allen Carr book. I loved those cigarettes way too much. That did nothing. It wasn't any nicotine replacement. That shit just drags it out and never worked. 

You know what did work? Laser fucking acupuncture.  The first day was a little rough and day 2 even harder. Day 4 I think I almost failed but instead of letting anxiety own me I popped a Valium and made it through. 

Walked right out of a gas station without buying a pack. It was the strongest moment of my life. After that it was all gravy. 

I want to help  because I think I know a working recipe. I'm still not in the clear but I would never ever have made it cold turkey. I still can't believe I don't smoke. It's the craziest concept after 23 years of smoking.  But here we are.

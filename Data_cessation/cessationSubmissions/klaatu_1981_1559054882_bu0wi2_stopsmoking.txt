Feeling nauseated when smoking. Considering quitting

I've been smoking on and off for a while. Started late in the game, when I was 31 (yeah, I know), stopped after 4 years of it, went 3 years without smoking and now I've been smoking again for maybe a year or so.  


But lately for a month or so, I've been feeling pretty nauseated when smoking, and feeling like going to the bathroom for a number 2 whenever I do. Any of you ever experienced this? Because I'm gonna be honest, I used to feel good when smoking (and that's why the thought of quitting was far from my brain) but now....feeling nausea and everything is taking the pleasure out of it and maybe that's my chance of putting this habit down forever.

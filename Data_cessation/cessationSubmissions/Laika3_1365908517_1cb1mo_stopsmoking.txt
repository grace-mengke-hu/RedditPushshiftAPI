Let's do this!

I've been a smoker for almost 4 years now and have tried quitting many times for the past 3 years. The past few weeks I've especially been building up the mindset behind quitting. Why I need to and want to. I've been athletic all my life, and here I am at 20 and struggling to go for a short run. That's just pathetic. I need to treat my body with respect and be healthy again. I don't even want to think about calculating how much money I've thrown down the drain. I wouldn't be worrying as much about rent and finding furniture if I hadn't spent so much money over the years. I'm tired of smelling bad and worrying about when I can duck out next to light a cigarette. 

I know I've tried quitting before, but I really want this to be the time it sticks. I downloaded Quit It and Since I Quit to remind me how much money I'm saving and the health benefits I'm getting. I'm reading Allen Carr's book and already feel much more inspired this go around. Cigarettes don't relax me, they don't relieve boredom, so why bother hurting myself? 

If anyone can give any further tips, it's much appreciated. I'll admit I kind of wrote this as another reminder for myself. And I wanted to see my little badge :P

Have a good night!

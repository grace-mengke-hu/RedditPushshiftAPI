Smoking Cessation Research Study

I wanted to announce that the T-SCAN Lab at Rice University is conducting 2 week compensated research study investigating how people experience and manage cravings. 

Your participation will come in three parts. First, you will meet with someone for our lab for a one hour Skype session where you will do a task looking at and thinking about smoking-related pictures. Second, for one week, we will ping you brief surveys throughout the day via mobile phone. And third, we will follow up at the end of 1 and 2 weeks with a 10 min questionnaire. 

Participants will be monetarily compensated for their time in the study. If you would like more information, please email us at Rice.TSCAN@gmail.com or fill out the screening form at https://goo.gl/forms/dI5LgNsN6dEyC1HE2 to see if you're eligible.

Getting nasal surgery this Friday I need to stop this crap and I want to.

I just can't resist those sticks of cancer... I started smoking at about  14-15 and didn't stop since except one time and now im 18. This one time lasted 4 months, saved about 500$ and I was really proud of myself but one day, I got really anxious and smoked about 10 cigarettes in a day and this got me back on the boat and even stronger ... I'm smoking like a pack a day and was smoking about half before. ;(

The smell, Oh God!

The smell of people smoking, or people who have smoked recently makes me want to puke. Quite literally. I can smell someone who's smoked recently at the other end of an aisle at the store. It's so freaking gross. I think my pregnancy has a bit to do with it, but I can't believe I went years smelling that gross. 

We went out to eat the other day and there were people smoking in front of the diner. I never realized how disgusting and rude that is until the other day. 

On the other hand I had a dream last night that I was smoking. It's odd. I don't really get cravings but once a day or so now, but I'm dreaming about smoking?

Patches

In my commitment to better health, and my forgetfulness of old age, I accidentally slept with a nicotine patch on. Let me tell you: I don't recommend it.

I woke up sometime in the dead of night screaming at my phone because I had such a vivid dream my boyfriend was texting me as he sheltered in place during a workplace shooting.

I'd almost rather have the stupid cigarette. *Almost*

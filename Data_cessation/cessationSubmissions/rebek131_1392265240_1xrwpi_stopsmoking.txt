Chantix Side Effects- When Can I Stop Taking It?

I've been on Chantix for two and a half weeks and smoke free for 11 days.  The Chantix side effects for me are pretty awful- nausea (which has subsided a bit but is still a problem), bloating and constipation, total and utter irritation (the slightest things set me off), etcâ€¦  Problem is, it's working! I've had an easier time resisting cravings, and even those have been much less terrible than when I tried to quit using other methods.  I guess my question is- what is the minimum amount of time I should stay on the Chantix, and should I try to stick it out?  Would love to hear from folks who have experience with using Chantix to quit.  Thank you!

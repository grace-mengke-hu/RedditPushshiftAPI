Quit smoking about 2 weeks ago and feeling strange. Would really appreciate some help!

Hi,

I quit a couple of weeks ago now and the withdrawals were all fine in general. Nothing that really concerned me.

The problem is (and one of the reasons I quit smoking) that I get quite anxious about things. I'm 26 years old and I have a habit of blowing things up in my mind.

So the issue is that the last couple of days I've been feeling numbness, tingling in my hands and my toes. I've also been feeling like there's a pressure in my head.

Also just generally feeling very dizzy and/or out of it. I guess brain fog would be the best way of describing this.

Is there anyone whose been through anything like this? Is it normal?

Before anyone says go to the doctor I have done that in the past and been told I'm fine. They also need to send you off to do a series of tests which takes around 2-3 weeks to complete and given I'm considering going back to smoking to stop feeling this way that's not really helpful.

Any help really appreciated!

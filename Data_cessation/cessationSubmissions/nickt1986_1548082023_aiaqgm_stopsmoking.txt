This is it... Day 5

I've lost count how many times I've tried and failed to stop smoking over the past couple of months (and years). After another failed quit, where I made it to three days, I caved. I hated myself, yet again. 

&amp;#x200B;

I stumbled on Zyban on the net and thought this would be my miracle cure. The doctor didn't know too much about it so refused to prescribe it to me. I was distraught, and thought this would be my only chance left. After all, over the years I read the Allen Carr book (where I quit for 7 months, and stupidly had that "just one cigarette"), did hypnotherapy, used vapes, NRT &amp; champix and the rest...

&amp;#x200B;

So believing Zyban would be my only help, I booked in to the doctor's again to visit a different GP the next day. I made a solemn vow to myself that if I was prescribed the medication that I would never smoke again. To my delight, at the time, the GP agreed to give me Zyban. I was thrilled. The doctor said that I must continue to smoke for a week whilst on the medication before quitting, which I did. However on the medication, I was not feeling myself. It really got me down and miserable. And I know what you're thinking: this was just the nicotine withdrawal, but it wasn't. This was much darker, and I was feeling this way before my quit day. In addition, the cravings weren't going away. But since I made the promise to not smoke once on the medication, I stopped smoking after a week. However, my state of mind was at an all-time low.

I knew that I couldn't continue on the medication for another 2 months, so I made the decision to stop taking Zyban at the end of Day 2. It was like a reality-check: this is what smoking resorted me into. Taking pills to help me kick this. This realisation was the motivation I needed. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm almost into Day 6 now. It's strange. I get occassional cravings, but I know I cannot and will not and do not want to smoke. Instead I try to remember and smile and know these episodes are signs that I'm ridding my body on the effects of smoking, step by step. It annoys me that I think about smoking a lot; not wanting to smoke but hoping that I soon stop thinking about smoking. It's a catch 22 I guess. I look forward to the day where I can go even a day without even thinking about smoking. I just need to continue on this road to recovery, day by day!

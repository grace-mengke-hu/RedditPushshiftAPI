Not a single puff

Hi guys, I've been lurking through this forum about a month ago and got inspired by yall big time! I was reading a lot of your stories and was able quit for a week but then decided to smoke "just one". Of course that lead to buying a pack, but I managed to quit again for another 2 weeks! As I tell myself yet again "one couldn't hurt" I smoke another single cigarette. Guess what? I've been smoking for the whole week (pack a day) like I never left. How stupid I am to have ever picked up this toxic and foul habit. Here's to never smoking again! (aka not a single puff)

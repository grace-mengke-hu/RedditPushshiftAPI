Today is my birthday - And also the beginning of (yet another) attempt...

27 today. Smoked a pack a day since 2007, just random cigarettes (maybe a few a year) before that. I had quit in 2011, which lasted 45 days (my longest ever) - but I fell off the bandwagon when my exfiancee kicked me out in December of 2011.

I'm tired of it. I have a sore throat, and what may be a lump there, as well. I feel like crap, I cough nonstop. My immune system is shot. I'm just tired of it.

About 2 months ago I purchased an electronic cigarette that I have been using to try and curb my cigarette intake. it has worked to cut me down a little bit (down to about a half pack a day), and I'm ready to try this again. On top of all the bad side affects, my kids deserve to have me around for many, many more years.

Here's to everyone who quit recently, is thinking about quitting, or has successfully quit. Wish me luck - I have no support (I live alone, now...), so I know it'll be tough.

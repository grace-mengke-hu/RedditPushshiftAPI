Ever dream of smokes ?

I started my no-smoke journey 2 months ago. I failed a couple of time. But, one particular day I fought a friend of mine over his weed habits (It once got me kicked from my previous house i had rented). It made me hate smokers and dope-heads all together and I quit for good.

Ever since I have had few dreams where I smoked and woke up to find myself clean off that habit. I find it weird sometime that I break my resolve when I dream but it is truly satisfying when I wake up.

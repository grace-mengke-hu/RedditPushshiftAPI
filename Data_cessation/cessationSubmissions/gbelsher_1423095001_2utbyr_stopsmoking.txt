Every cigarette is my last. Help me. Anybody.

For the last one year every day I tell myself that from tomorrow I'll go cold turkey. I'm 23 and I've been smoking 6 cigs per day for the last 9 years. I'm a skinny shit, 55kgs,my hair is almost gone.  I'm afraid I'll die if I go on but I just can't stop. At the end of every day I decide that this will be my last.

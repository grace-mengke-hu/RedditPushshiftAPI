Off the wagon today

I smoked on & off, mostly consisteny for about 1-2 years. And I'm  not gonna lie, i slipped up today. Took a benzo and fuck! a stogie just goes too well with that (used to drink so I'd  compare the combination of a cigarette  to a beer) but honestly, Im not too bummed at myself. Since december 16th, i smoked 2 on new years eve & 2 today. Id say thats hella progress from 2 to 3 a day. 

Tl;dr; you may slip here & there, but its a ladder to an end. each day is its own stepping stone, each day is a chance to win.

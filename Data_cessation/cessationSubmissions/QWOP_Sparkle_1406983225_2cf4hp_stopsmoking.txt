When does 'feeling ill' stop?!

Quitters flu is just irritating more so than anything...

I'm not having any major cravings, thankfully, but I just feel ill all the time. Like bloated, indigestion, coughing, sore throat, chest etc.

I had this last time I quit and it was bad for the first few days then it calmed down to where I barely noticed it but this time it's just there constantly, been to the doctors, they said its just my body rejecting the bad stuff.

I guess even if theres a coping method anyone can recommend? Currently on Peppermint tea and yoghurts for the stomach concerns. I just want to chill, especially as I'll be working full time hours again soon.

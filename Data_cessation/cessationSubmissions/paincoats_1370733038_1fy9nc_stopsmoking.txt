I have one cigarette left, not buying any more.

Money's been so tight recently. I have $30 left until Tuesday, cheapest pack I can buy would be about $12 (Sydney). I went a whole day without last week because I couldn't afford any, and you know what, I was fine. Not going to make a big deal out of this!!

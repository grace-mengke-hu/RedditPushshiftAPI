One year done.

Around a year ago I made some big changes in my life, the most important of which has been to stop smoking. 
I hope anyone reading this on 'Day One' can draw some solace and support from the fact that it really does get easier. 
There will be days where it doesn't seem like it and where 'Just One' seems like it would be okay but stay strong guys and gals and get out for a run or a walk as often as you can as your sense of smell returns!

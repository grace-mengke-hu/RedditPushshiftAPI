Day 9.... wobble yesterday!

So pleased that I can say I got to 9 days today... I went away for the weekend with a non smoking friend and so it helped LOADS with my quit. On the way home from the trip my brain was shouting “go and buy cigarettes, the weekend is over now, it’s fine, you can smoke!”... it was flipping hard to drive past the shop where I would normally buy cigarettes and drive home, unpack and go to bed. I said to myself that if I still wanted to smoke this morning I could, but of course I didn’t and I’m now very pleased I didn’t give in. Feeling so much more positive about life, health, work and the future as a non smoker. To feel like this 95% of the time it’s got to be worth the 5% which is a bit of a challenge at the moment, and that 5% will get smaller. Thanks to everyone on here for the support, you guys make such a difference :)

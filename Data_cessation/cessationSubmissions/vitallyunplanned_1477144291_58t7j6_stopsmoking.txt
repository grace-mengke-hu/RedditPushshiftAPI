I asked my best friend to choose a number between 1 and 30. He chose 28 so 28th November is my quit date!

I've tried and failed to quit many times in the past but looking back I have never really prepared myself for it. I smoke 20 a day, I'm only 25, my dad is in hospital again, he had half of each lung removed a few years ago and continues to smoke. I don't want that to happen to me, I would be an idiot to keep smoking.
I've read that having a quit date is a good way to prepare. If you guys have any advice or tips for me on how to keep off the cigs for good I would be very appreciative. 

28th November is just over a month away, is that too long?

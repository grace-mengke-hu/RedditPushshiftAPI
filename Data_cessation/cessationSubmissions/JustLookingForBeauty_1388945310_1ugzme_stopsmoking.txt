After 5 days smoke free I just relapsed and smoked a couple cigarettes

As many people did, I stopped smoking at NYE. The cravings were A LOT weaker and I was finally thinking I could make it. I got trough 5 days and now I got home. I know I had a pack of cigarettes in my bedroom and couldn't resist smoking a couple. I regret it. I now smell like smoke and I know the next craving will be a lot stronger. Just wanted to make this post to have record that I made something I regret.

Edit: My personal record: 5d14h. I'll just gonna reset the counter and try to be better than past me.

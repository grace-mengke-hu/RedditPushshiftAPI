Hey guys, I'm so happy!

I haven't technically quit ( I'm using a nicotine replacement). I feel so much better though, I can walk up stairs without feeling like I'm dying!


Anyways, personal achievement of today: sat outside with all my smoker friends and didn't even crave a cigarette! I was actually sort of repulsed by the smell:)


GO ALL OF US. FUCK CIGARETTES!!!

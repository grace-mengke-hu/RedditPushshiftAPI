I'm turning 36 soon. Been smoking since I was 18. Literally half my life. This is the longest I've gone without a smoking…

…and I feel completely fine with it. Actually, I'm happy about it. Wish me the same strength over the weekend. A full week without smoking will be a milestone for me.

And to all of you, keep up the good work.

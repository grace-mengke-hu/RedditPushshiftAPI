More than 100 days :) Also, colds more frequent now? Wtf?

I am happy that I reached 100 days free :) 

Now, why am I having more colds since I quit? I used to have 1, mostly 2 per year, and I have already had 5 or 6 colds since last December :/ I am exercising and I do not think I am having more contact with sick people than before. Is this a side effect of quitting/lung cleanup/other thing? What can I do to prevent more colds?

Thanks!

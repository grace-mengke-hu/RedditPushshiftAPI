one week!

So, I had a breakdown today due to stress of bills and finals coming up. I was crying and all sad and shit. I wanted a cigarette so damn bad! I fought the urge, and I have to say, that was one of my greatest accomplishments ever. That was the times I would chain smoke. AHHH, SO PROUD! If I can do it, so can you!!!!

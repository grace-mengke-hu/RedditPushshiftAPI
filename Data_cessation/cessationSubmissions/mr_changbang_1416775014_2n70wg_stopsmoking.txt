Day 1! Any advice on how to think positively about the process?

Hi, a bit of background here, I'm an 18 year old male who's been a light to moderate smoker for the past two years and I have smoked primary in social situations, to "manage stress" and to go along with coffee.

I'm done with cigarettes forever. Any advice on how to think positively about the process? In other words, how to cheer up and be happy with this, because the shorter days and colder weather in England plus the fact that I'm getting flu-like symptoms, could weaken my resolve to quit...

Edit: thanks for the comments about Allen Carr, I've both read his book and seen the video.

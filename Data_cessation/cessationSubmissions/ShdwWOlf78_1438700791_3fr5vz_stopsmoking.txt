Six months. Could NOT have done it without you guys.

Though I used a quit smoking aid, I truly believe that this time I couldn't have made it this far without the help and support and advice of everyone here, and the fact that I truly wanted to quit this time.  I started down this path because at the beginning of this year I realized that I had been smoking for 25 years.  That's longer than I've pretty much done anything else in my life besides breathing and pooping.  So again, thank you all from the bottom of my heart.  For all those just starting out...it gets easier.  I PROMISE.

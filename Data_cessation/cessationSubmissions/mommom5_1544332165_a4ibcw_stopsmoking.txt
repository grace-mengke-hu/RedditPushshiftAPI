I HATE THE WEIGHT!!

I just checked my app and I’m just shy by two days of being 3 months smoke free and not even excited about it.  I’m just disgusted with myself.  In these 3 months, I’ve gained 22 pounds.  My dr even said he’d rather see the extra pounds vs me smoking.   And yes, I know... go for a walk, work out, cut back on the snacking, chew gum, drink more water, snack healthy... blah, blah, blah!  I don’t want advice right now, I don’t want suggestions right now, I don’t want anything but to just scream how much I hate the fucking weight gain!  Everyone wants to give me tips and I just want to say shut the fuck up!  I AM MISERABLE!!  I don’t want to go buy new clothes, I don’t want to accept the weight gain and I have nothing to fucking wear and I’m just really HATING EVERYTHING right now!!  

And again, I’m not looking for advise or suggestions, I just want to vent.  ONLY VENTING!!

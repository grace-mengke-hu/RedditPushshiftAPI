I can't believe how much confidence I've gained

If I'm grateful to the horrible Nicotine Monster for anything, it's that he came into my life and let me beat him -- which has given me more confidence than I ever thought I would have. 37 days smoke-free, 32 days without booze. Thanks to everyone on this sub for your support!!

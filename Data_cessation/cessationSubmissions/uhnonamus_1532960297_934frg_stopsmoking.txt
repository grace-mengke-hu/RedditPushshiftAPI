6 days 9 hours in!

I’m using the quit smoking app and it recommended I come here for support. 

I’ve quit before (3 months) in the past using the Easy Way to Quit by Allen Carr. This time I feel that difference in my mindset; that I’m never smoking again and it’s no longer apart of my lifestyle/identity. 

I’m an amateur runner and intermediate cyclist and saw the benefit in my workouts almost immediately. My pace improved and I didn’t have to work past the terrible burning in my calves like I usually do. 

I would love to hear from: 

* people who quit and how it helped improved their running/bicycling.

* people who have also quit who have awesome advice/stories to share 

Also I would love to hear that the cravings will go away completely one day. 🤞🏻

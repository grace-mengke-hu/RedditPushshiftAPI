Need some help

I’m a college freshman who got addicted to cigarettes middle of last quarter because of stress and emotional problems. It started off really bad and when I went on break and over Christmas I quit for a few weeks, but when I went back I ended up right back where I started because of the same issues. I’m quitting again but It’s such a staple and way to decompress I almost don’t want to. I already hit the gym and surf and have a lot of other outlets but smoking seems to help so much on top of that. I guess I’m asking you guys because I need to see others who have been through quitting for good, and know that it really is better on the other side.

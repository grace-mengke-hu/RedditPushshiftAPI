I missed it by 1 day and 10 hours according to my app... But I'm 1 month smoke free!!!

Fuck tobacco AND vaping! I'm free! But never letting my guard down. Thanks to everyone in this sub for being inspiring and supportive. And if you're thinking about quitting or struggling through those early days/weeks, you can do it, I believe in you!

Filling the Void

I'm almost 2 weeks cold turkey, and amazingly enough, this quit has been quite easy for me (knock on wood). I do get the occasional thought to smoke, but I'd be lying if I said I actually CRAVED a cigarette. Truth is I honestly DON'T want to smoke, but I do want...something. 

The first week without cigarettes, that "something" was food, and I probably put on 10 pounds in that week (I'm exaggerating, but not by much). I'm watching what I eat now, and started exercising again, but I still get that "void feeling." I'm trying to figure out what to do with it.

Does anyone know what I mean (about the "void" I mean)? Previous quit attempts would've found me back at the gas station relapsing to fill it, but like I said, I don't want that now. What do you guys do to fill this void (short of eating yourself into a coma)?

Thanks!

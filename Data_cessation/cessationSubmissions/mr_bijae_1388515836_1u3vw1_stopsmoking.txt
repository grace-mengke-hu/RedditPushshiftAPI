It's going to get a little crowded in here...

But all are welcome!!  We've all been in your shoes, quitting on NYE or other day. For those of you that are quitting tonight at midnight, welcome to the club! The first few days are going to be tough, but we're here to offer help and encouragement. I know the first few days for me were brutal and I was in here nearly every day. It's a tough battle, but you're stronger than you know! You were a non-smoker once in your life, become that powerful non-smoker again!

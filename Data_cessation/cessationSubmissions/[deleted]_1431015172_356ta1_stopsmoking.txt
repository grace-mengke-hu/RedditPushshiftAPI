My motivation is thinking of who I want to be in the future.

I've been smoke free for five months after 2 1/2 years of daily smoking menthols. 

Here's some of what I learned:

- I will only have success if I want to quit more than I want to smoke. That was it for me. All those failed attempts were because, at the back of my mind, I didn't reaaally want to quit. The change occurred when I looked at my future and realized I do not want to be a "smoker" throughout my life.

- In order to quit, I had to get to a place mentally where ever smoking again wasn't an option. Not a maybe, not a kind of quit. If there was any inkling left that maybe I could smoke sometime in the future, well that effort failed.

- The only thing that motivated me enough to quit was to look at my future and the person I wanted to be. My health was not a good enough reason because I am a sucker for instant gratification. The social stigma, the smokey smell, those too weren't enough. Only taking a cold hard look at myself right now, and realistically looking at who I would be if I didn't quit, was sobering enough to motivate me enough into quitting. Thinking of the choice as two different life pathways was helpful:

1. I continue to smoke. I don't change my eating habits or my exercise habits, because I'm trapped in the idea that it wouldn't matter anyway because I'm a smoker. I never address my anxiety or depression issues, because with smoking I can distract myself from those. I continue to socially isolate myself, gain weight, and generally have crappy mental health. I continue to look at life as a series of chores and tasks I have to get done, like schooling and then an endless career, just to survive. I get some self-indulgence in my "I don't give a fuck" attitude, but deep down I know it's because I have mental health problems and other issues that are keeping me stuck in a stagnant pool. I keep smoking. Someday soon I'm 30 or 35. I'm probably obese, probably have health issues like lung problems, my childhood asthma came back, and walking up the stairs is a challenge. My social life is crap. I am so disappointed in myself for screwing up my life that I will probably never find motivation to get better, and at worse, I will drink and smoke myself to death on purpose just like my father did. I defend this lifestyle with a sense of smug cynicism, and continue to live in denial about my personal responsibility for any of it.

2. I quit smoking. For a few months I do get a bit of an ego boost about it, but eventually it's just part of my life that I'm not a smoker any more. All those mental health issues I've avoided since going to college start popping up. This is the first time in my life I've tried to face them, instead of running away into smokes, food, or videogames. It's not fun; in fact for a couple months it might be the worst. My friend smokes the same cigarettes I did; being around him, especially when drinking, is a huge temptation. I tell myself NO continually as that's not me anymore. I continue to have mostly crappy habits, but I know I've got the ball rolling at least. Pretty soon I'll go to a therapist who can hopefully help me deal with certain issues, which I know are the root cause of most of my self-sabotaging behaviors. Someday I'll be 30. Maybe I won't be skinnier or have a better social life. But I know I'll be healthier all around, and I'll be on the right pathway. 

A lot of smoking for me, was putting today in front of tomorrow. Who cares if I damage my lungs today, or I feel like shit today? I only get one life! Well.. I wasn't really enjoying that "today." Sure, I had a lot more laid back attitude about things, but that is because I was too sick and depressed to really care. I don't want to be depressed and self-sabotaging forever. I don't want to laugh in public and then wistfully dream about having a better life when I'm alone at night. 

**TL;DR The only thing that motivated me enough to quit was looking at who I would be if I didn't quit, and who I really wanted to be. I was using smoking to avoid mental health issues, and I decided I didn't want to feel "just okay" anymore. Look at your two life pathways between smoking and quitting; which one is the life you really want?**

Good luck all! Stay positive and think of the future! Think of how great it will be to start feeling better! You can do it!

Who has stopped reading Allen Carr's Easy Way, because you knew you were going to stop smoking after finishing the book?

This book is weird. It almost awakens you. I remember reading half way through and stopped reading it. I actually got scared at the fact that I'll lose my best friend forever. Cigarettes were there for the best and the worst of my times, and I've become terrified that I'll never have that moment again.

So I stopped reading it, and kept it in bookcase somewhere for another two and half years. 

While I'm doing house cleaning month back after Thanksgiving, I find this book again out of nowhere. For awhile I thought I had lost it somewhere and I was for sure that I had to buy one again.

I just finished rereading the book couple weeks back. This book plain WORKS and makes it EASY. Yesterday I was able to truly enjoy coffee at local Starbizz and felt sorry for those smokers who went outside in the cold rain only to be addicted to nicotine.

For those who really wants to quit Cigarette. I highly recommend this book. BTW I'm not getting paid, I'm not selling shit, I think the book is available at your local library as well. 

This book only costs about two to three packs of your favorite cigarette. What do you have to lose? You were going to spend that much money on cigarette and burn it away anyhow.

Legalize marijuana, make tobacco illegal.

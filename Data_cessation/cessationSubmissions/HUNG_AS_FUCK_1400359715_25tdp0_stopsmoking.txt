Wanting to quit and needing advice

Ok, I have been a smoker for 5 months now, so I am relatively new to the habit, so i hope there is time to quit before I get even more addicted. I work a very stressful environment, so smoke breaks are really craved, especially after busy days, like they are at present. Anyway, my friend smokes and so do i. I believe he wants to quit too

I have tried going cold turkey and usually i fail. I find when I shop the habit of asking for a pack of Malborough is habit when I get to the counter. My parents do not know I smoke, as i live overseas. They are coming in September and I want to be COMPLETELY smoke free by then

So please, help a brother out. I do suffer depression and get down and bored easily, but that is no excuse for me to indulge in this nasty habit.

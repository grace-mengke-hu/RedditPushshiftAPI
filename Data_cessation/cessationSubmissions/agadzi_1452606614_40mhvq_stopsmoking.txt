Cigarette Free 50 days. Cravings question

Hey all, thanks in advance for taking the time to read this. As the title suggests,  I have been smoke free for 50 days. I started running 5ks every other day, so I am staying proactive with my health.  I am 23 yo african, and smoked about 2 packs a month for 2 years. I was wondering if this damn craving for cigs ever goes away. Every morning driving 40 min to school, I feel like I am dealing with the proverbial devil and angel on your shoulder, to cave or not to cave, debate. My physical fitness and allllll the cardio I have been doing is really motivating me to stay clean. But these cravings aren't going away and it is really getting to me. Not to mention they are compunded 7 fold if I take a srimulant like adderall. I know I did this to myself for starting to smoke in the first place and it is ny burden to bare. I just want to know if these cravings ever go away.  Thanks

Just quit smoking, breathing feels tight. Is this normal?

So I just recently quit smoking roughly 3 days ago. I'm now noticing my breathing is tight and seems like I have to yawn everytime in order to get a deep, full breath. Is this normal?

I smoked cigs for roughly 4 months, about 3-4 a day. Is this just my lungs recuperating? Or should I be worried? I'm only 21, I'm somewhat worried, thanks

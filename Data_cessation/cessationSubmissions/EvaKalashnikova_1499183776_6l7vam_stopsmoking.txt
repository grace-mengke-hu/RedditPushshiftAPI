Trip with heavy smoking friend

I'm 3 days in on quitting and so far it's been better than I expected, except for some overly sweaty hands.But there's one obstacle that I just don't know how to tackle and that's my best friend that is not considering quitting. We're going on vacation next week and I'm scared I won't be able to resist if she lights up twice an hour. Any tips on how to stay strong, since this isn't just some strange smoking at the bus stop that'll be gone any other minute.

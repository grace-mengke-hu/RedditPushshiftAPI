All my friends smoke! I need motivation..

I want to stop smoking really bad!! I don't even like it anymore, not even a little bit.. But all my friends are smoking and I'm afraid they'll not be supportive enough.. How can I make my point clear to them, without making them feel bad about themselves for smoking?

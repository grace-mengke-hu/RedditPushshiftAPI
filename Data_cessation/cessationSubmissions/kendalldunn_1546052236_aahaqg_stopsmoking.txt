Cold turkey vs cutting back?

Has anyone had success with cutting back? I’ve tried to quit cold turkey and have had pretty bad luck doing it. I know some people who have tried smoking once in the morning before work, and then one right before bed, but I’m not sure if it was just their will power or if it’s more effective. Thoughts? Any help would be appreciated! Thank you in advance!

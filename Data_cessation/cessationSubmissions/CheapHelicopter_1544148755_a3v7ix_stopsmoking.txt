Five Days!

I have "quit" since May. By that I mean I haven't bought a pack of smokes since then, but I have indulged at least once week by being around people who smoke a bumming 2 - 4. 

A couple days ago I realized that I wanted to quit for good. My indulgences were keeping one foot in that addiction, and since we were all busy with work and finals I knew I wouldn't see my smoker pals for awhile. I'm spending the holidays around people who don't smoke, so I'm thinking "Why not now?" Today I got a notification on my quit smoking app that said five days! Huh. I may actually do it this time!

16 Days - I miss it

I'm seriously considering going back. It's been going well, been using the patch and the cravings aren't really so bad. I guess I just miss it. It helped me so much. It made every day easier and nicer. I just feel like I was happier when I could disappear from the world for 5 minutes. Now I don't know what to do. I really wanted to quit smoking before I quit, now I'm not so sure. I just keep thinking how nice it would be to light one up every once in a while, but I don't know if I'm the kind of person who can moderate this kind of thing. Anyone go through this?

For info I'm 23 and been smoking about seven cigs a day for three years.

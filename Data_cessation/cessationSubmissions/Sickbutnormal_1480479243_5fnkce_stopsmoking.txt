I've quit cold turkey multiple times

I have a whole range of health issues from Asthma, hiatal hernia, hashimotos (thyroid autoimmune disease), HS (autoimmune disease of the sweat glands) and psoriasis (autoimmune of skin cells on my scalp)
I have the hashimotos being treated, emergency inhaler and my psoriasis is under control thanks to a really good shampoo I use almost daily but most of those conditions are affected by smoking. I also have IBS which one of my triggers is anxiety and caffeine and nicotine have an effect on that as well. I know I need to quit but I have 2 young children (I do NOT smoke in the house nor go out without a jacket) and I work- cold turkey is my best method  (I have a full supply of the gum and it made my IBS act up)
How can I get past the numbness, dizziness, cold sweats and mood swings while working and taking care of my kids? I'm tempted to try the gum one more time because both times I used it, it gave me different symptoms.

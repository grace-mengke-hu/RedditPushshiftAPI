Attention Whore

2 months completed. Shiny and (almost) cravingless. It's all in the head. Once you beat the physical addiction (in 2-3 days + a few weeks so your body reduces naturally your nicotinic receptors to normal - you'll notice that when you can take a dump every morning on time^yes,seriously ) the rest is all in your head. There is no nostalgia needed & there's nothing to miss.

I am still so glad this is over.

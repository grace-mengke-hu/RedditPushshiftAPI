79 days and BOOM! had a cigarette :S

Five years of daily smoking, quit cold turkey and lasted 79 days before I fucked it up. I had had some pretty intense stress for the past week due to my exams, a few fights with my gf and some other issues so I broke and had a cigarette. I have to say that at first it felt like a huge relief but now I really regret it, I feel like im back in square one. 

Please PLEASE keep in mind that even though you feel like you have gotten out of the fucking disgusting habit - even a little slip can relapse you back to where you started. I have to reset my badge now and start this all over again. Im still convinced that I wont relapse again but second time over it feels even harder than the first time.

Stay strong!

I've finally done it

And its changed my life.  

I havent smoked since my birthday (sept 3) and I feel great.  Not only that, I've completely changed my life.  I've been working out everyday now, and can definitely see the difference in ease of breathing.  

I've replaced my bad, toxic habit with one that will make my life better.  You can do this people, its easier every day.

6mo in - a list of unexpected benefits

Aside from the obvious smell, cardio and cancer benefits stopping smoking allows you. I have noticed some other super great things that were totally unexpected. Some of these may be commonplace but back before I quit I truly did not appreciate how much these little benefits add up (in order of importance):

- I can now breath in Saunas and Steam rooms so I enjoy them and go (thus actually also go to the gym)

- My fingernails are much stronger - super for scratching that itch

- Libido increased significantly

- Things taste a whole lot better

For those of you who are still in the smoking trap - don't wait another day. You can do it, you will do it!

NO ONE knows..this is awesome.

Sorry I still trying to figure out how to post. So please bare with me. 

So it's been 3 days and 9 hour that I smoked my last cigarette and decided I wasn't buying any more. And I haven't. I had been reading this blog for a little while and decided to put all the valuable info to work.

I (48M) am the only smoker in my household. My wife (48F) has always complained about the way I smell and she dont want to kiss a ashtray. But my sons (12M) came up to me last year and asked me to try and quit.

Well I did Jan 3 at noon I smoked my last one. I didnt tell anyone that I was quitting because I didn't want to let anyone down. My mom came over today and we always go out side to smoke. I stayed out before we had supper and she smoked 2 and I just sat there talking about her week. Then after supper we went out side and she smoked two more and just sat there.

I walked in the door and the first thing my wife said was "YALL MUST HAVE SUCKED THOSE DOWN QUICK. YALL SMELL HORRIBLE". No she didnt say in front of my mother. She just said it. Thing is I didnt smoke at all and she is still saying my clothes stink. I dont know if I'm going to say anything and let's see who is the first to find out.

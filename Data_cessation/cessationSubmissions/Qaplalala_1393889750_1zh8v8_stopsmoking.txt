Visited my dad in El Salvador for a week and never indulged in his extensive stockpile of fine Cuban cigars!

I don't think having a cigar is as bad as smoking cigarettes but if I'm able to resist the relatively less harmful (and much more enjoyable) temptation of a cigar, then continuing without smokes is looking good.

When people say its gets easier...

Do they mean being able to say no to cravings or craving cigarette full stop? 

I was never a heavy smoker- under 10 small rollies per day was average (over 10 years or so) if I wasn't drinking/ going out. I haven't smoked for 4 weeks now but I still want a cigarette a lot of the time (with coffee, after food, with alcohol). It's pretty easy to say no but I think that's down my comparatively light smoking habits.

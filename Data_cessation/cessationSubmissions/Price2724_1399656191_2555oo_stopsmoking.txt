Quit day

Today is the day. I picked my date and time and feel that I really want to go through with it this time. I keep telling myself that I love myself more than cigarettes, but my mind keeps trying to trick me into thinking how much I enjoy them and all the times I turn to cigarettes to make me feel better. I am scared that I will slip up. ,my quit time was set for today at 4 pm, but I decided to smoke the last cigarette in my pack and be done. I am worries that I will slip up and disappoint my partner again. She has been asking me to quit for over a year. I did it last year but only lasted almost 4 months. I had a hard time with the psychological withdrawal and was crying all the time so I went back. I had how smoking makes me feel. I used to be so active and athletic and lately i found myself turning to cigarettes instead of working out  I am determined but scared. They are my crutch I use to cope with life. I have downloaded two quit apps and hope I can find some support through here. My mantra is I love me more than cigarettes. Let's hope it works. Any tips or words of encouragement are appreciated.

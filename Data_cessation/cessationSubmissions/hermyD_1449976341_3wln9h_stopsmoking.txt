35 hours smoke free. Longest time in 11yrs.

26 F, 1 pack a day, currently using Nicoderm, and so far I'm at 35 hours. I tried quitting multiple times and failed hard each time. 35 hours is huge for me. I find the patch has been much more helpful than gum or trying to take my mind off things. 

Wish me luck please. I'm terrified I'll relapse again.

My cravings are nearly gone, but...

It's been 10 days, and my cravings are almost completely gone, other than a few very mild ones, but I have very regular dreams in which I smoke. I then wake up feeling relieved that it was just a dream, but it's still disturbing and it reminds me of the taste of cigarettes. When will this stop?

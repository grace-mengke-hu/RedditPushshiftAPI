Back to work from memorial holiday

Good morning everyone I hope you had a relaxing smoke free weekend ! I know mine was full of ups and downs but I stayed strong . This whole weekend being away from work and home with my SO whom doesn’t smoke had me feeling like I was really missing out on my normal routine . This morning standing around with my crew who all smoke , they stood there doing what I’ve done with them since I started working here . I had to leave them because they smelled so Horrible ! Ugh I just wanted to puke . Can you believe I use to look forward to standing there smelling like shit ? Gross  . Day 5 ! Firm in my belief I made the choice that saved my life !! Live long and healthy friends

My poor neighbour!

The only person sad to see me quit was a neighbour of mine who randomly gets smokes from me late at night.  I was happy to be able to disappoint him last night!  It was also the first time I physically in person said the words “I quit smoking x days ago” and hey it felt good!  Made up for white knuckling it through however many cravings... plus he looked downcast and said, how?  I wish I could.  Well, I said, I just stopped.  That was it.  No need to elaborate because I had to close the door and go bite my hands for a few minutes.  It’s so worth it though!  20 years of smoking, all done and gone and I am NOT going back.  HaPpY NeW YeAr to me!  ⭐️🦋💛🔆

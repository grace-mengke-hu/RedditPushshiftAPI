Long-time quitters or new, what's the single best thing you've enjoyed about quitting?

So I just wanted to try and offer up some encouragement to those of us who are newbie-quitters on what are some of the things we can look forward to, to keep us focused on the end goal. 

What have you enjoyed about it? What has surprised you about it?

Anything specifically you can think of that really makes it a bonus when you become a non-smoker?

5 days in, feeling low

So I quit smoking 5 days ago. I've quit several times but this one felt different. I didn't use patches, e cigs or anything else that I've used before, just decided to stop. I don't miss it or want to smoke at all, even though I was on 20 plus a day before, but I have noticed that I'm feeling really down as a result of withdrawal symptoms. Has anyone else experienced this? How long does it last? It's beginning to really get to me!

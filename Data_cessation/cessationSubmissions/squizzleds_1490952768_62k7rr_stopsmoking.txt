Stomach issues

Ok so did anyone suffer stomach problems when they quit. I have IBS, managed extremely well, but since I quit my insides are so screwed up. 
If you had problems how long did they last?
If you had IBS what happened when you quit?
I have no desire to smoke but so bored of feeling terrible

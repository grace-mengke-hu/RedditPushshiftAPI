When you fall off the horse, get right back on.

Not mad and growling at the horse, not mad and growling at myself. Well, kind of. I just had that 'just one' that became 'just two.' Oh how quickly that happens. What am I doing?!#@^%$# ??? What I'm doing now is getting back on the horse, that's what. I should have come here instead.

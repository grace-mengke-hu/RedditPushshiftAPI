Checkink in

Hello everyone! It's been a while since I droped my last cig. and decided to step in to the batrle against tobacco. It wasnt easy , but it was god dammit worth .I am smoke free for more than a year , feeling wery clean and happy. One thing I noticed that no matter how much time its elapses , you are still going to think about smoking from time to time , its just 60s thoughts that come and fade away . It never leaves you. Anyway I want to wish everyone to stay strong and keep going !

I'm tired of this addiction.

That's it, I quit, I quit smoking as of an hour ago, I ripped my cigarettes apart like a mad man and torched the box and broke my ashtrays. I don't care if I have to go through hell and back for the next few days, I quit. My mind is already playing all sorts of games with me, asking me to go to the store to get milk and sneak a puff, I decided to ignore it like a buffalo standing in the rain.

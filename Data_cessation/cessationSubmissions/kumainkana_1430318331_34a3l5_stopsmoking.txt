Fell off wagon, want to get back on

II was a smoker for over a decade when I quit September 2013. I quit cold turkey, in the midst of a breakup and a sickness, and did fine until February 2015. After a sudden storm of relationship problems, family problems and work problems, I bought a pack and have been smoking a pack a week since. I've been rationalizing that it's not that much and that I just need a little to get through this time. However, it's almost May and I'm scared that I won't be able to quit. I get news on an important work issue next week and I plan on smoking my last cigarette then. However, it's so different from when I quit in 2013. I was going through tough times then but I just didn't want to be a smoker anymore. Now I know it's bad for me, but I feel like life would be so much worse if I didn't have this. I don't have the same drive as I did in 2013, I just want to stop in a very intellectual way and that terrifies me. This is a dangerous habit but it really helps me  function.
Anyway, I saw this sub and wanted to ask for help. Any advice on how to get that will to quit (and stay quit) back?

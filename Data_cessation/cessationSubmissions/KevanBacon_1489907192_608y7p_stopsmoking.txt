It's time to make the change. Not just for myself but for my fianc√© and our child.

She's 9 weeks and 1 day pregnant. She's overcome smoking for the baby. I need to quit. It's not just about me anymore. I've realized that starting 9 weeks and 1 day ago my life changed forever. My future son/daughter will come to rely on me for the rest of my life. If I keep smoking I'm taking time away from us. 

Fuck smoking. It's time to be strong.

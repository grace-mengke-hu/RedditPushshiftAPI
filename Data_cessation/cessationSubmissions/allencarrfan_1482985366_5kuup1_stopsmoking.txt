this is it!

Decided today that I'm going to stop smoking.
I watched the Allen Carr webcast and I'm all set to have my final cigarette shortly.

Just want to wish everyone else that is quitting all the best. Do it now or if your waiting for NYE its all the same. Just stick to it, make it happen. You dont even have to do anything about it! You get to do less! Just dont buy and burn filthy cigarettes in your mouth.

Please leave a comment if you have any advice on qutting or if you are also embarking on this journey. All the best Xo

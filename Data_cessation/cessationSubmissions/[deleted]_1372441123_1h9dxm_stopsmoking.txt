The Sun is Out Again

     I just wanted to check in and let those who have just quit that after two weeks I am starting to feel joy again. It was like a dark cloud was over me. Many others have mentioned it before.

     Just stick it out. I know now that I am done smoking. Sure, I get the occasional craving but they are very light and manageable.

     Keep your head up and your mouth out of the ashtray:)

so Yesterday was my first full day of being smoke free after 10 years!

I feel good, i don't ask myself whether i should or not. Reading all this posts about people really wanting to be in charge of their own decisions has got me so motivated!! WE can do this, one day at a time. I'm dropping drinking and weed as well. They don't do anything but take my time and my health.  I need to focus on my future. I hope to keep this mentality up. Let's do this PEOPLE!!!

Three months in but I’ve pulled out half an eyebrow, any tips on how to cope?

I quit January 28th after 18 years of a pack a day smoking, since I was 16.   I was in and out of the hospital for other issues and on my second trip they gave me a patch and I’ve been using those ever since.  I’ve been very stressed and feeling like I don’t have a great way to release it.  I’m still recovering from surgery I had so I can go all out with physical exercise just yet. When I’m just sitting or watching tv now I constantly catch myself picking at my eyebrow.  I feel like I’m constantly on edge and irritated and snapping.  As a typically cheerful person, this is really getting me down.  Anyone else go through this? Any advice on how to deal?

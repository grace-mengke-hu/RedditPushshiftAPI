A question for the more successful quitters, if you'll pardon the irony of the statement.

So, I just hit three months without my little old friends. I'm very pleased with myself, obviously, but as the light at the end of the tunnel starts to brighten and the constant agony of "why aren't you smoking you silly boy" starts to wear off, I find myself wondering something. Here's what started it. 

Moments ago I was sitting here, surfing reddit, and came across a video of iguanas. I live well north of the Wall, it you'll pardon the Game of Thrones reference, and our lizard population has been largely nonexistent since the Jurassic. Well, these little green dash bastards get me thinking of the last time I saw a lizard, which was in Orlando earlier this year. Cute little thumbnail-sized thing zipped out, catalogued me as pure evil, and disappeared back into the grass. Totally new experience for me. But can you guess what I was doing when it happened, and can you guess what happened when I remembered? 

Oh good God, right now I'd kill each and every one of you for one of those stinky little pricks. 

The question is whether or not these periodic sudden, agonizing cravings bugger off eventually. I mean, I think I can deal with it regardless, but momentarily I could feel myself sitting in the warm Florida sunshine, and... Well, you know what I was doing. Does that eventually get better? I can't even guess the triggers before they come half the time now that I'm not simply craving 24/7.

TLDR: I'd really like for someone to say that eventually I won't crave nicotine.

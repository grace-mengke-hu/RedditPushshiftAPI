My second morning.

Ive been smoking for 17 years, this year is the year I really want to kick this habit. My cravings are the worst in the morning when I wake up. I am using lozenges(Nicorette) about 3 times a day. Im just worried that Im prolonging my nicotine addiction with the Nicorette. I want to get over the hump, but I fear I wont be able to without the  Nicorette. Any one have experience with Nicorette and has an idea of time frame compared to cold turkey to Nicorette?

To those hitting the 72 Hour Mark

Congrats.  The realm of bullshit you've survived at the hands of your own brain is something to be proud of.  I myself had a three day weekend, was living in an apartment I don't smoke in, and figured "fuck it, let's get the nasty time out of the way before I get into the work routine."  

In the 11th hour of my time away (actually the 60th or something) I starting typing up some shit I need for work over a few beers, and bam.  I smoked two cigarettes.  Two shitty, unsatisfying, useless cigarettes.  I feel like a bitch, because, well, I am. 

Altogether though, I feel great about what I did. I did cardio at the gym without gasping for air.  That only took 2 days. I was EXCITED about cardio for the first time in a year after two days.  In this time away from smoking I also felt like I overcame at least 40 logic battles with my own brain. 

I hope this reaches someone at the point I was at. Your brain is a bitch to tobacco.  In every activity you do, your brain will find a way to put a cigarette in your mouth.  At 72 hours, you will suddenly be proud of yourself, as you deserve to be.  You already won some major battles.  Don't fuck it up now.  It's not worth it. They taste like shit and that faintest of flutters in your heart is, in fact, really fucking bad for your body and won't come off as anything else. You know better. KEEP THE FIGHT ALIVE. It is, after all, the fight for your own wellbeing.



Fuck smoking.  I will get there. You already have.  Do NOT compromise the emotional investment. Ever.  

It takes a good deal of emotional fortitude to start a quitting attempt.  I had mine and let it pass.  I'm ready to start new in the morning.

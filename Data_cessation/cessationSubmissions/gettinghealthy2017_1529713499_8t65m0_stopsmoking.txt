just hit 17 days // 339 cigarettes not smoked

that number of cigs not smoked is blowing my mind. I'm so happy to be a non smoker but today the cravings are hitting. I'm still on the patch, going to step 2 next week, but today was rough. hanging in there!!! i'm too happy to be a non smoker now to give in :)

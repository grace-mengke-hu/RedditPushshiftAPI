Ready to get serious again.

Hey /stopsmoking! It's been a while since I've posted here but I'll try to keep this short :)

I'm a 20 year old college student who has been smoking a pack a day for about 4 years now (within a month of my first cigarette I was going through a pack every other day) and I'm ready to take control of my life again. But I know I really need your help. At times it seems like everything in the university environment revolves around smoking. The breaks between classes, parties, friends who smoke etc. 4 out of 5 of my closest friends are smokers, but I couldn't imagine them being anything but supportive if I were to quit.

I would consider this next time my 3rd or 4th real attempt at quitting (if I make it past 24 hours) I just seem to lose it on the 2nd or 3rd day. Extreme anxiety, inability to function, loss of sleep and appetite (because god forbid, if I eat too much I would need a cig). This whole thing is really taking its toll on my mental health. I feel so weak and defeated when I cave but soon suppress all of that and am back up to 20 a day.

Long story short, I really need some help getting over that initial withdrawal hump. Any advice from college students who have quit while still in school? Or anyone, really!

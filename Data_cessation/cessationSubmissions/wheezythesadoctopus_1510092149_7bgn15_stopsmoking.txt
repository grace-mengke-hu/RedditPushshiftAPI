Quitting strategies

Hi all

I just wondered what you all had as strategies for quitting? In my early 20s I smoked a lot, and as I got older I weaned myself of every other cigarette, so I would skip the one I would normally have at certain points of the day, until it came to only smoking when I have a drink.

Then it became only smoking after I have had 2 drinks.

Then 4.

Then 6.

I am now up to only smoking if I get up to 8 drinks in an evening, and I will continue that way until I can't physically drink that much.

What tactics do you guys have?

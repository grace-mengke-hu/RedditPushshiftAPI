Day 3, feeling good, but I'm worried about work tomorrow...

This is about attempt #231 to quit, and I'm really feeling like it could be the last.  I feel great, the cravings feel incredibly manageable, and I have every incentive I can think of to finish this off once and for all.  These last four or five months, I haven't even enjoyed smoking, but...you know...addiction and all that.  

There have been two things that have consistently ruined previous quit attempts for me, though, and I would appreciate some help in overcoming one of them.  The first has been alcohol (I've been having a couple drinks every day since I quit in an attempt to break the association between alcohol and cigarettes.  Seems to be working so far).  The second has been work.  A stressful day at work has always broken me down and gotten me to start smoking again.  I know that this is the right time and I can get through this, but some advice or words of encouragement never go amiss.

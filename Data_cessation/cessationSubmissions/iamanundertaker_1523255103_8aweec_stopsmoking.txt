Is the paid version of the Smoke Free app worth it?

Looking at this app and wonder if all the paid features are worthwhile for quitting. It also doesn't seem like it's got a feature for slowly reducing your intake before finally being smoke-free so I wondered if anyone has tips for that.

As an aside, I'm on mobile reddit and can't seem to change my flair. I think it's wrong since  I quit a few years ago and never changed it back once I started smoking again.

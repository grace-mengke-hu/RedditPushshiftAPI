I want to stop, but i don't want to.

Somehow I want to stop because it's unhealthy, and expensive. But it feels so normal to me already. If i sit in my gaming room and smoke, if i am out with my friends, so idk. 
   
I think you'll advice to stop, so whats the best method? I tried it by pure will, once 8 weeks and once 4 weeks.

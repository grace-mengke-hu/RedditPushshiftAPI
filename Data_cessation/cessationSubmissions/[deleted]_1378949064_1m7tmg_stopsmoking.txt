hello my friends im struggling in my journey of health

hey everyone first off i would like thank everyone on this sub for providing me inspiration and advice. secondly im almost 40 or something days nicotine free and im still having having occasional cravings is this normal? there much less intense but when they do come it seems like a tottaly fine idea to have a cig. but 10 minutes later i remember how terrible smoking is. do cravings ever completely subside?

also please excuse my lack of punctuation im a sub standard typer writer at best.

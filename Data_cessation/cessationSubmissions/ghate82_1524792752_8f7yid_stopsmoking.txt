Day one is here

Well im done. Cigarettes have controlled my life for the last 24 years. And im only 36! Today i had my last smoke after work. I went the vape route and i have to say so far so good. Tomorrow is another day. I know how hard this is going to be but my god i cant wait to be able to taste food, smell better, maybe even run without feeling like im gonna keel over. One day at a time is how ill take this!

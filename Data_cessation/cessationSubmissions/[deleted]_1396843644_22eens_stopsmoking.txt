This is it guys.

I woke up today with a cough, sore throat, runny nose, general allergy symptoms. My first thought was about a cigarette, as usual. I stepped outside to smoke, as usual, and it just felt wrong.

I'm 21, started smoking around last July/August to fit in with some friends. Silly I know, but it happens and I'm here now. 

I've been smoking about a pack/pack and a half a day every day for the last 7-8 months. Since then I've stopped working out, fallen into a depression, and everything has been going seemingly downhill. 

This is the first time I have gotten sick, and really the first time trying to quit. I feel ready. It was a stupid thing to do, especially being raised up knowing what it does to your body. 

I just smoked the last cig I had, I got two puffs in before I threw up. I think it's safe to say that I'm done. I'm at work right now for the next 7 hours, I won't have access to a store and it will be the longest time I have gone while awake with no smokes. But I'm okay with that, it's scary, but it needs to happen. 

I'm going to be a father in November if all goes well, I don't know why my first thought when I got the news wasn't to stop smoking. Character flaw I guess, I feel terrible now. 

Here's to a new chapter guys, I hope it goes well for you all. Cheers!

Smoked for less than a year, quit for 8 months, started bumming again. I feel like a failure.

I had quit for longer than I smoked and then I started bumming again. It began as a moment of weakness and I feel like it's snowballing. I haven't and refuse to buy my own pack but I keep buckling and bumming 1 or 4 from friends. I don't know if this opinion is controversial or stupid but I still don't consider myself a smoker again, because I don't want one when they're not sitting in front of me, but I can't help but feel the heavy guilt that made me quit in the first place. My heart is just sinking because I was so proud of my 8 months and I feel like I threw it all away. Anyone have some words to help me get back on the wagon?

almost 300 days in and starting to think about smoking again more often

Hey fellow advanced quitters. As said in the title, I'm more often thinking about smoking than a few months ago. Did any of you guys felt the same? is it one of those 3 days \- 3 weeks \- 300 days thingy? Or is it just my first spring without smoking and the nice weather is linked to smoking in my mind? Stories and experiences are appreciated.

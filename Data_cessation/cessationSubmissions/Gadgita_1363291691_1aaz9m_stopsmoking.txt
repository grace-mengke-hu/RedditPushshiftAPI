60 days - hardly even think about it anymore 

I barely post in here, just lurk as a reminder I suppose. I quit 60 days ago, cold turkey after a pack a day for nearly 11 years. I'm only 26 years old and just decided I kind of enjoy breathing lol That was enough to put em out. Good luck to every body out there still struggling to quit ! :)

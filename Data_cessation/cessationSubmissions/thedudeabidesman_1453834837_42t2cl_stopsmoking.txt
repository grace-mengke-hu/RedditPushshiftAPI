Nicotine/Cotinine test next wednesday

I have a nicotine/cotinine test next wednesday for a new job opportunity. I just smoked my last ciggarette at 1:30 pm. I have been a pack a day smoker for at least 10 years, and i was wondering how long it takes for nicotine to be completely out of my system. The research I have done says anywhere from three to 30 days depending on which kind of test is given. I was hoping that somebody here may have experience with nicotine testing, and could possibly give me some additional information on the process. Anything will be helpful, thanks in advance

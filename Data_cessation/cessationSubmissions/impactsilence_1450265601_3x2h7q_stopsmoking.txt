If you still smoke, listen to your lungs

I stopped smoking because my lungs started sounding weird in the morning and sometimes in the evening. Combined with overall low energy and an irritating fixation on the smoking ritual, I began to see how my body is adapting to the habit in ways I have no control over (and just imagine what was happening in the more subtle systems of my metabolism... yuck).

In order to stop smoking, I also stopped using Facebook (it is hard because it was my main communication tool with people, but the overall impact is extremely positive). Ending two habits at once is strangely satisfying.

Now I plan on using only the best tobacco ever for special occasions (four times a year) and smoking only a single large cigarette, as it should be according to the people who started growing it. 

But right now, I'll give my body at least six months of regeneration time and I really recommend everybody who has been struggling for a long time to try the same approach.

Why the fuck is this so hard.

I quit my e cig a month and a half ago, and had only smoked cigarettes occasionally, cigars etc sometimes too. Then I had a craving for something after like 2 days and bought a pack of cigarettes. The transition to 3-5 cigarettes a day was shockingly easy after using nicotine juice for almost 2 years. Then I smoked for two weeks or so, quit. Was feeling alright but then a friend offered me a cigarette and I started all over again. Then I quit again last Saturday. I was going to a political thing with a friend and in the morning I realized I didn't make lunch, but if I made lunch I wouldn't have time to smoke before meeting him. I thought that was fucked up so I tossed my last 6 cigarettes and said I'd be done. Then 2 days ago my alternator died on my way to work and I couldn't start my car. I was 50 miles from home, but had a friend nearby. I called him and he was more than willing to come jump me (I wasn't sure it was the alternator at this time). He was smoking when he showed up and it was at this point that I had the biggest craving yet. It'd been about 3 days, it was probably all mental but goddamn did I want a cigarette. Now here I am again smoking. In theory this is easy, you fucking stop. I'd got over the hump/nearly over the hump three times now but keep going back. 

Also this morning I was smoking at the transit center around 6:30am and was asked 4 times for a cigarette, and once for a cigarillo. So that's not something I'll miss when I quit. 

I'm going to quit again, but next week I'm house sitting for someone that smokes inside and I'm afraid the smell will mess with me. 

Time to reset my flair. I really should've a month ago, but I was avoiding this sub because I felt shame. I felt like if I ignored this place I could just keep going. 

On the upside I had a doctor's appointment today for a vaccine and she said my lungs sound great, so I haven't completely killed myself yet.

I gave up on Wednesday after 14 years. I think I'm doing alright.

I stopped smoking at 10am on Wednesday. I looked at my half smoked roll up and just thought to myself "what am I doing?"

I started smoking a couple of months shy of fourteen years ago. I was eighteen and had been smoking weed for about a month prior. My friends at the time and I used to joke that I was a toker, not a smoker. Then there was a dry period and I couldn't get hold of anything, so I started smoking cigarettes to 'compensate'. When I was able to get my hands on an eighth again, I didn't stop smoking cigarettes. 

After work I bought an e-cigarette and later a dry herb vapouriser. I haven't lit anything up since then, and I've been sparing with the vapourisers. I'm hoping to be able to continue cutting back until I no longer feel the need to put something in my mouth and inhale. I'm hoping that my breathing and general health will improve, and I'm making an appointment tomorrow to see my doctor so I can have a check-up, which is now long overdue.

I'll take whatever happens as it comes. I made the decision to start smoking and to continue smoking, and it's taken me this long to finally make the decision to stop it. The fault and responsibility is solely mine. I hope I can look back in fourteen years and thank the younger me for finally seeing sense.

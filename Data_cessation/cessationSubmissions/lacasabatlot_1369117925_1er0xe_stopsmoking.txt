132 days later: i smoke a spliff

I was with some friends who really wanted to smoke weed, and so one of them rolled it up.

After the first inhale i noticed that there was tobacco in there.

Its been so long since I had a cig, I asked them if they thought it would count and they said no. I should've stayed strong, but I didn't.

Does this count as a relapse? Should I reset my clock?

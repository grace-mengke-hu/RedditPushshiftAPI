And holy shit, have the cravings come and gone lately. 
I started off with zero cravings, and quit cold turkey (around my 2nd or 3rd time quitting). Lately, I've been so tempted to start again. Mostly because of life stress, anxiety, the works. I've gained some weight since I quit as well, and I was able to lose/maintain easily when I smoked (due to it suppressing my appetite). Basically, I have a lot of really stupid reasons to start smoking again, and I'm trying to keep my resolve.

r/stopsmoking, send me some of your willpower!

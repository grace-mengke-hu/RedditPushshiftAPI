I really need help..

I had a badge for a week then I relapsed yesterday. The pack is still in my purse and I'm itching for a smoke. I didn't smoked today. I smoked again because I was having a very rough and the worst day I can imagine(I think).

Whenever I am dejected.. I grab a pack. Honestly, I started again back in April because I was so so so sad. Cigs make me happy. 

I started again this week because I thought I was building a friendship with someone who would quit with me. But idk.. I think I got too attached because my state have always been needing someone for support. But due to some complicated reasons.. I can't be friends with that person anymore. Crushing for me.

Anyway, I feel very indecisive right now if I ever did a right thing in my life or it's just me regretting that I relapsed. I've always depended on someone. I never did on myself. It's hard. I don't want to depend on cigarettes anymore too. 

All the support I have for myself that I built since last month and this week for trying to quit has crashed into ruins. At the present.. no one is supporting me. I'm torn between needing someone to support me as in physically present or I have to do this by myself. I know how sad I am I'm confused about my feelings too because if there is someone caring and supportive by my side during a morose state.. I might fall in love. (Which is bad news)

I am so tired and sad of everything. And cigarettes.. I both love and hate it.

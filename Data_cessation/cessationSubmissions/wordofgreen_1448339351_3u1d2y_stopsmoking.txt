I just celebrated the 5-year anniversary of the last cigarette I ever smoked. To everyone still struggling, keep at it: It's absolutely worth it.

I feel so much better, I smell so much better, and the financial savings are so helpful. It's a hard road, but it's absolutely worth it. Good hunting, fellow quitters!

This is my 5th attempt. 5 days in and feeling pretty confident..I hope.

I'm 45 years old and have been smoking since I was 15. I've tried to stop smoking 4 times in the past. Once, I quit for 3 whole months (longest ever) but then I let a family issue push me back into smoking (that time was cold turkey). This time, I went through 1-800-QUIT NOW. They've been sending me 21 mg patches (up to 8 weeks worth, 2 weeks at a time) and these patches are REALLY helping! I've had to start with the 21 mg patches as last time they sent me 14 mg and I smoked with those patches on. I definitely plan to beat that 3 month record too.

Thing is, my cravings are still through the roof as I'm only 5 days in my quit and they're not getting less severe as I'd hoped. However, I've found that praying, breathing, walking and preoccupying myself help tremendously when the cravings attack. Another factor that has helped me make this permanent is the fact that my husband is quitting with me. To be attempting to quit and smell smoke on him everyday would have made me so desperate, I'd have chewed his cigarette butts!

I really don't know what made me finally decide to get serious about quitting THIS time. When I get my coaching calls, they ask me why I decided to quit and I always find myself saying "Because I want to be a non-smoker". That just doesn't seem reason enough to me. But WHATEVER the reason, it's working.

Another thing: I'm going through a flurry of emotions!!! Angry one day, irritated the next, then depressed. As I type this I'm depressed as hell and don't know how to shake it. Any tips on getting through the EMOTIONAL setbacks????? Help!

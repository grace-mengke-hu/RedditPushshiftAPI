Day 7 – My method. Details inside

Hey everyone! So I got a prescription to Champix. You’re allowed to smoke while on it. What Champix does is makes your brain hate the taste. After the first day, you can’t even finish a whole cigarette. You lose interest in it. Eventually the thought of smoking disgusts you. 3 people in my family have quit smoking because of Champix.

The side effects suck though. You won’t sleep much and you’ll have the most lucid dreams. Occasional nausea as well. So, just a suggestion.

Good luck

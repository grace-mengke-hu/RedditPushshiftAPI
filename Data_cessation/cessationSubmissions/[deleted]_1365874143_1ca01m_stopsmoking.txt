My boyfriend is basically forcing me to stop, it's been 2 weeks but I still want one so bad.

If I don't tell someone I'm going to lose my mind. These past two months have been full of the worst possible events I've ever experienced. My mom's mom, Nana, died, my only sister, who is seven years my junior, had her first abortion, the cops and wildlife control busted into my house 2 weeks ago with a warrant for "Commercial Harvesting of Freshwater Mussels" and took my entire shell collection (hundreds), took my only pet, a squirrel I rescued as a baby a year ago, and took every computer in the house, removing my main source of liveliness because I work from home. The night the cops came an left, I lit up again after being quit for two months. I smoked a couple borrowed cigs over the next few days before I told my boyfriend I didn't want to lie or hide from him but I was really having a hard time quitting. He wouldn't budge. And now I've been quit again for 2 weeks. 
I've been so depressed, sitting waiting for the cops to come back without my squirrel to return my probably broken shells. Last night I just couldn't take it anymore. I can't think. I don't want to do ANYTHING. I feel like there isn't any reason to do anything anymore. My motivation is shot. I'm in a cage where everything I used to love is boring as fuck now. I want to LEAVE him over this, and I can't care how stupid that sounds anymore.

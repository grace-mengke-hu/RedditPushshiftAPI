Torture.

Long time lurker. Ive been subscribed to this sub for months. Ive "quit" multiple times in the past only to start back for whatever reason. I've "quit" at least 5x. Made it about 7-8 months about 2 years ago. I tried again yesterday. Made it 24 hours before I caved in. 
I recently took a new position at work. It's very stressful. Yesterday there was a brief moment whenIi wanted to smash my laptop for taking too long to load a page. When my finger print wouldnt work to unlock my phone I contemplated stabbing it with a pen. I am not an angry person. Ever. I am typically very joyful and fun to be around. I would never hurt anyone or be violent but whenever I attempt to quit I am always extremely irritable and everything ticks me off. I become very impatient. Im always impatient but without smoking it's borderline ridiculous. 
My most successful attempt was aided with Wellbutrin. I still have some left over but am hesitant to take it. There's maybe 15 pills. In order to get a refill I must see my doctor. The problem is during my last quit effort, when i was doing really well i told my insurance that i was a non smoker. Now i can't really go to the doctor for quit smoking aids. I'm afraid I'm just going to have to tough it out. I've been down this road before. I know it will subside, but it's bad. I'm afraid to quit with work because I am in management at a very large manufacturing facility. I really don't want to lose my cool and put my job in jeopardy. 
My entire plant is a non smoking facility. Part of my position is to enforce this rule. It's my job to catch smokers out back and write them up. I never have. I go out and see them and keep walking and just claim to not have seen the cigarette but u still feel like such a hypocrite. I never smoke at work because it's the rule, however i absolutely cannot wait every night to get out and reach for that lack of Marlboro 27's.
This shit's tough. I am trying again on Monday 5/16. Wish me luck.

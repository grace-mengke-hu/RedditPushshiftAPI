Day 2

Ending any relationship is difficult. Considering just how much time we’ve spent together, all the places we’ve gone, the things we’ve done and seen; this will definitely be hard. Maybe harder than anything else I’ve ever done before. Part of me still loves you, and thanks you for keeping my head above water for all these years, but the other part of my has always hated you... The other part of me feels like you’ve actually been the one holding me under this whole time. Making me choke and spit and gasp for my air while you watched. You’ve been telling me all along that you were my problem fixer, my friend; that you’ve been saving me and I ate it all up.

But last time you were saving me, I saw you smirk, and now I know why. I found your secret. There was something malicious in your smile that day, and after I saw it, I couldn’t unsee it. I realized that it’s been there all this time. It had been me who was blinded to it. 

You’ve been my captor, dressed as my saviour all along. 

I felt so understood by you, how could you do this to me? I loved you. How could you waste so much of my time and cause me so much harm? 

You are the definition of an abusive relationship. You had me right where you wanted me then. But last time, I saw your smirk. And now I know who you are. I see you.

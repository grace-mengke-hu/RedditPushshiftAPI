Stress is making my decision too hard

I have a rough time right now, my job is draining me everysingle day (i start a new one after next month), i have to find new apartment and i only have a month time because i'm moving to another city, i feel like i just vanr stop it, i smoked today like 30 cigarettes, i feel like i want to punch everyone on the face.

My plan is to quit when i move, not maybe cold turkey (might use light nicotine gum or some zonnic), but now when i think about it i just feel my whole world is gonna crash if i do, and i do want to quit. I think i'm a bit scared to relapse and that i would punish myself too hard about it.

I will still do it, my plan is to be smokefree at the end of the year

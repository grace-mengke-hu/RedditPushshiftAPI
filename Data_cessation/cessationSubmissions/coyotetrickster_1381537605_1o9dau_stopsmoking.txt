It's been 72 hrs

Three days, that means the nicotine has left my system. I really want to drive to the quickie mart and buy a pack but I won't. On the plus side there is no frog in my throat anymore and my sense of smell is a lot better. I've made too much progress to go back. If you are trying, you can do this. I was a heavy smoker and the withdraw was not that bad. You can do this.

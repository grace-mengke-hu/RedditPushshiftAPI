When I get cravings, I google facts about the evils of tobacco companies until I’m amped up or disgusted enough to protest and never smoking again.

I know this won’t work for everyone, but it’s something that really helps me. I turn my cravings and addiction into something concrete and legitimately evil that I can fight and protest against. It boils the blood, but it’s also extremely interesting and distracting. It makes me feel powerful and proactive resisting the urges.

I know my health is also something concrete and worth fighting for, but it’s easy to rationalize and give into desire.

I smoked for 10 years since I was 18 years old and recently quit this January 2018. It’s a struggle but it’s getting easier.

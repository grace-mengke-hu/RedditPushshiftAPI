Failed after 8 days. Starting over.

I managed not to smoke for 8 days. Then, we were out for dinner, had a couple of drinks and everybody smoked. So I joined and smoked a couple half a pack. 

Next day I hated the smell and the terrible taste in may mounth. Disgusting.

Eitherway, I feel bad about failing but also feel good that I managed not to smoke for 8 days. Super motivated to try it again :-)

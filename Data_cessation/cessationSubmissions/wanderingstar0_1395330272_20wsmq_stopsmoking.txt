Three weeks! Some thoughts for those starting out.

So after [This Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1zcd5x/when_did_you_stop_constantly_thinking_about/) I thought I would follow up.  First off, thank you to everyone who replied - it helped immensely.  That was easily the worst day of it.  Now three weeks in the idea of smoking pops into my head 2-3 times per day but it is not a craving per se.  It is very easy to dismiss and move on from.  It gets easier each day. 

I "did it" (so far) by reading Alan Carr's book and this subreddit.  The biggest help was [the WhyQuit.com effects of nicotine withdrawal timeline](http://whyquit.com/whyquit/A_Symptoms.html).  Knowing what was going to happen helped me mentally prepare most days.  I referred to it often.  The rest of that site is invaluable to me.  I was a sceptic on the Carr method, and preferred WhyQuits more realistic approach.  I also took three days off work and was basically alone during the worst of it.  I found interacting people hard when quitting in the past so I knew getting over that hump was important. 

The one thing I don't see anyone mention often as a benefit is being able to lay in bed on the weekend mornings.   I used to bolt up when I woke up and run outside for a smoke.  Now I can kind lay around and ease into the day again.  It is great!

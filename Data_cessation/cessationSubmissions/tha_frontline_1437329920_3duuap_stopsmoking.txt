2 days in

I had a very bad cold for the last 4 days. Coughing, fever, running nose. Two days ago I decided to use this opportunity to quit my smoking-career which lasted 12 years. Now I am afraid what will happen when I am healthy again in one or two days. I don't miss the cigarettes right now and I'm not craving, but maybe this is only because I'm still ill...

help on quitting smoking

Hi everyone! My name is Victor. I'm 28 and I've been smoking for 17 years. I wanted to seek some help on where to start with quitting. A little background on my history with cigarettes...My family has always had a love affair with tobacco so I've been around it my whole life. In many ways, it felt like a rite of passage for the men. My brother and cousins, who are former smokers, have quit but I've still been continuing the addiction. My grandpa, who was the patriarch of our family, passed away in May 2009 from lung cancer. Recently, my uncle, who I look up to the most, was diagnosed with lung cancer and I feel my days are numbered and I'm scared that I will suffer the same fate. In my late teens and early 20s, I was on a 3-5 pack a day day regimen, I've quit that since and now down to 1/2-3/4 pack a day so luckily I'm on my way to success but I need help on where to begin the end. I apologize for my rambling as I just joined Reddit and am unfamiliar with etiquette on this site. Any suggestions are welcome and will be appreciated.

Thanks Reddit!

Victor

Long time lurker, first post here.

So I had a freaky dream which I'm hoping will give me the willpower to quit. My pop di
ed from lung cancer when I was pretty young, and my nan died shortly after. So a couple nights ago I dreamt that I was walking through a hospital with my nan, then we just sat in a waiting room, but the only thing she said was 'you should quit smoking, something bad is going to happen'. Ever since then everytime I light one up her words are all I can think of. So today, when my pack runs out, that's it. Any advice is much appreciated! My partner is doing it with me, wish us luck :)

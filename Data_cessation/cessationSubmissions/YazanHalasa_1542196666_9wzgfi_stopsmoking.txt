I quit smoking and started vape, getting severe cough?

I quit smoking 3 days ago, for the first time in 8 years, however I’ve been using vape to deal with the withdrawals. 

However on the second day I started coughing, haven’t smoked anything all day (3rd) but still having a dry cough without sputum (very dry less than a teaspoon if I do, and its yellowish/green in color) 

Is it due to vape? Or because I stopped smoking? 

*i don’t usually cough in the morning.

Starting today.

Been a smoker for 7 odd years and need to quit, I can feel the toll its taking on my body every day. I've tried quitting a shit ton of times but never seem to last more than 3/4 days. Anyone who can give me some advice to help me get through the first couple of days would help me so so much. Whenever I usually try and quit I lose my voice after 2 days, which is a nightmare in my job, anyone have any tips to combat that?

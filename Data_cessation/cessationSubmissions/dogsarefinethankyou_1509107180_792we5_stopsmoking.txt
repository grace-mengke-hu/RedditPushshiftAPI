Quitting vaping?

So, used to be 2 packs a day smoker, switched to e-cigs and 24mg/ml. Recently got into zero mg after years of tapering off and been vaping with that about 2 weeks by now. How do I quit the habit of vaping? I mean, there is no nicotine anymore, but I still feel cravings to vape and those cravings are gone after I vape. Will I eventually just cease to crave and naturally drop the habit, should I substitute vaping with something else or just go cold turkey some point?

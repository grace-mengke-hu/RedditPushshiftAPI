Teenager needing some discouragement

Hey guys, sorry is the title is misleading, but I really need your help.
Here is some background: I'm a teen and smoked only once in my hole life, with my mom. She is not a smoker and never was, but i came to her with my problem (that I'm about to explain) and she helped me out. The thing is, that, as a super dumb teenager that I am, i see everywhere people smoking. In TV shows, in the streets, relatives, etc. And it appeals to me. I've done a program here in my country in 4th grade to help kids stay out of drugs, and I know how bad it is, I've done lots and lots of research in this subject and I always get to the conclusion that it's not worth it (this sub, for example). I Just can't get it out of my head and it started to be a mental conflict I have with myself everyday, and I can't get to my friends because that wouldn't solve it either, talking to my parents didn't get anywhere, so, I came here. Please guys, shock me.

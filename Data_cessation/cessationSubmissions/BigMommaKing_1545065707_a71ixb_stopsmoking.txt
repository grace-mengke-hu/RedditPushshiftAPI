Day 2 revelation took my depressive thoughts away

I have tried, and failed to quit more times than I could count. I had gotten to the point that I felt worthless from my inability to overcome. I would have extreme depression on day one that only ever got worse till I would cave. Then I had a revelation. 

The minute you put out any and every cigarette you smoke you transform into a non smoker. You succeed in that moment, the only thing you have to do to stay a non smoker is to keep not smoking. It sounds dumb but flipping the thought to already succeeding and just working to continue to succeed has made such a huge difference in my mental state. 

Every other time I tried to quit I felt like I was climbing a mountain and no matter how prepared I thought I was something seemed to trip me up. 

Now I just continuously tell myself you did it! You’re still a non smoker. Finally! It’s so nice to not smoke etc. every. Single. Time. I get the chance to tell myself those I do. 

If you’re out there struggling. Just keep trying. I finally realized that even if you’re two days in, five minutes in, or 5 years in, we’re all equally non smokers. We just have to keep our success going. 

I also found it helpful to drink wayyyyy more water than I was. I never realized how dehydrated I was. And the extra water helps with keeping my hands/mouth busy. 

Good luck to you all. I believe in you.

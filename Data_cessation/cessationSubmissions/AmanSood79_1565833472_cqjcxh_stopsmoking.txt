Dear fellow quitters :) .. I am going cold turkey. Been a month now. While I notice positives such as increased stamina I am also experiencing almost flu like symptoms every night &amp; morning. Feel feverish and nostrils burn. Have any one of you experienced this ? Will this go away in time ? Thanks !

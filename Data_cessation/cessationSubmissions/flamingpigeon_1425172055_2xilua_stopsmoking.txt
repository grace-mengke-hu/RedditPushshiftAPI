1st March aka Day 1 aka #teammarch

I'm ashamed to say that I relapsed 2 weeks ago and have been having 4-5 cigs a day. But now the time has come to get back onto that boat and start paddling away. 

I've set myself a challenge whereby I'm not to smoke this month and if by the end of the month I still feel as though I cannot live my life without cigarettes then I'm just going to smoke but for me to make that conscious decision I need to do this month, probably sounds stupid but that's the deal I've made with myself. 

No doubt I'll be on this sub whining like a little bitch or celebrating my day by day victories. Who knows. Who knows. 

I feel as though I'm in a point in my life where I need to progress and I don't want to progress whilst holding a cigarette in one hand. I'm gonna need both these hands free in order for me to become the strongest version of myself. 

Anyways, gonna leave it at that. It's 1am and I should get some sleep. 

Good night. 

Ps LET'S FUCKING DO THIS. #TEAMMARCH

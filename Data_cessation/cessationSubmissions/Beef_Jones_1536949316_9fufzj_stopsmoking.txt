I quit 3 days ago and today I ran 4 miles

I've been smoking for 10 years and I've tried to quit countless times to save money, or for my girlfriend or to appease my family, but I've never done more than cut back for a few days. I started my usual attempt a week ago, but this time I started running every day as extra incentive. The first day I maybe made it half a mile. The second day, maybe just under a mile. The fact that I was working on myself and not just pitying myself for not being able to smoke all I wanted  made something click. After my second day of running I decided that as of tomorrow I don't smoke anymore. I woke up and went for a run, my longest yet at just under 2 miles and tried to keep myself busy all day. That day was the hardest, but instead of being in the mindset of "trying to quit" I just kept telling myself "I don't smoke anymore." On day 3 I'm hardly having cravings, I'm able to hang out at work with guys smoking without feeling like I'm missing out, and I just finished a 4 mile run in the afternoon heat. I often thought that I was gonna end up smoking my whole life, but I just needed to do it for myself while working on myself at the same time. Just don't give up, quit for yourself, because you have value, and work on yourself all while you do it, it's way easier than you think.

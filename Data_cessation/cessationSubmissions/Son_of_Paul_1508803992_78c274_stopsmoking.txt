I lasted two days

I relapsed after two days, I'm disappointed. I recently had my girlfriend break up with me the day after i quit and it drove me back. Fortunately all my friends and family asked how quitting was going and told me to keep it up and they were proud. This made me decided to throw out the pack I was smoking while alone and put the patch back on. I feel like if they knew I smoked two days into it they would be upset and I don't want to disappoint them and trying again.

Boss offered me $1k to stay quit.

I quit on Friday night (like 1:30, 2am I had my last cig) and let myself stew in the awful feelings of quitting cold turkey all weekend, seriously, withdrawl is SO terrible. I have gotten by on the merit that if I ever want to not feel like crap for not smoking, I just have to get through this ONE time, after this, it's as simple as saying 'No'.

Well, today I got into work, and my CEO stopped by my office to see how things were going (he had just returned from two weeks vacation). We chatted briefly before I let him know I had quit, which he had been urging me to do for quite some time now. Well, as excited as he was to hear my news, I figured it would end there. As he started to walk away he stopped and said "Let's make it interesting then..." and offered me $1,000 if I can stay quit through the end of 2015. At first I thought maybe he was just kind of joking and that nothing would actually come of it, as cool of a guy as he is, it just didn't seem probable that someone would do that. 

Well not even 10 minutes later he came back with a signed memo outlining the details and said "I think I might be more excited than you are! I already consider that money yours so don't make me take it back."

The cravings were pretty bad this morning as it's only day 3, but I think I just got all the extra incentive I needed!

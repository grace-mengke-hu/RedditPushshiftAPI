Woke up and suddenly felt like not smoking.. Day 1

I used to smoke 10 cigarettes a day almost from 4 years. 
I was tired of the social stigma (girl  smoking always gets few stares),  useless dependency and wastage of money from last 6-7 months . 
As a runner, I was sure that quitting smoking would increase my stamina by some margin. 

But I never stopped.  I usually start my day with a cigarette when I go for no 2, but today I just didn't have any. 

I don't know the reason, but I just didn't feel like smoking anymore. 

It's been 10 hours and although I've had minor cravings, I've managed to keep myself busy at work and didn't smoke. 

But now comes the hard part of being in home and not smoking. 

Few advices to keep me motivated please â˜º

Made it to 7 days!

Well cold turkey has worked well thus far as I've made it to 7 days without a cigarette. I am very proud of myself and my partner is taking me out to dinner on the weekend as a present for making it this far. As long as he has known me, I have always smoked so he is pretty happy about me quitting. 

I have the first big test coming on Saturday night though! I will be out with friends for a birthday party. I am considering not drinking alcohol at all because I know it will just turn on that desire to smoke. 

Have other people found avoiding drinking all together is the best way to go, at least at the beginning?

9 hours into my 4th day, and it's miserable.

Today has been particularly brutal. 
Not that all of them haven't, to be fair. Since Monday, my insomnia is worse now than it ever used to be. It had just recently gone away too. But because of that my body is continuously sore; I'm not getting enough rest and I work as a package handler at UPS while going to school. 

I woke up this morning to learn a good friend of mine had died in a car crash, and it's weighed on me all through my shift and up until now, as I type this. It still hasn't fully registered; I'm sort of numb to the idea of it. 

I've been drawing ever since I got home. I need to do homework, but it's all reading and I can't focus right now. 

Tobacco is calling my name right now and I hate that.

Translate Allen Carr to American

I've been listening to Easy Way on audible and the Englishman's voice in my brain isn't working for me. I think it would be fun to hear how you'd translate the following phrases into American phrases: 

1. Isn't it marvelous (that I have quit smoking) 
2. That dirty/miserable/nasty weed (tobacco) 
3. The little monster (the addiction expressing itself as a craving) 
4. Yippie

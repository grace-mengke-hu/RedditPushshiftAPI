I'm done.

Not a heavy smoker at all, usually one per day before bed.  But enough is enough, this shit is stupid.  I usually smoke when I drink, and tonight after having a couple of beers I ran to the store to pick up a pack (good chunk of change where I live).  Bought the cigarettes, lit one and smoked it.  Felt the regret right away, so I ran (through the snow in my T-shirt) and gave the remaining 24 cigarettes and my lighter to a homeless guy I saw on the street.  This is it.  Any advice from the quitters of r/stopsmoking for kicking this shit for good would be amazing.

One month!

One month smoke-free today! I used the Allen Carr approach, and while it hasn't been without its temptations, it's been pretty smoothe sailing so far. I thought for sure I'd end up getting a vape or something, but it was important to me to at least try cold turkey. 

Thanks to everyone in this community for the support and reminders of how important this choice is. I hope I can help another in their journey as much as you all have helped me.

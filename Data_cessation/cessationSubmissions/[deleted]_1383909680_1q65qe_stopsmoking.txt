Repairing lungs and increasing capacity.

I was a 10-15 a day smoker for around 13 years.  I quit smoking about 2 months ago (I'm still vaping though!) and have been feeling great ever since.
Last night, I played football with a few friends.  I knew my fitness was pretty crap but didn't realise it was as bad as it is!  After 5 minutes of running around the pitch, I was completely out of breath and my chest was hurting really bad. I kept having to take breaks and eventually finished off the rest of the game in goal.  Even there, every save I made would immediately bring back the chest pains.
I was the youngest guy (25) on the pitch and by far the most unfit.  It scared the hell out of me and I know I have to do something about it.
I plan on running everyday to improve this but I'd like to know if any of you guys have any other tips to help speed the healing process along and increase my lung capacity as much as I can.  Thanks.

Still having mad cravings, But!

If I'm around or see anyone smoking I just don't want one at all! I just need these cravings to go and I'll be good lol When I do get a craving I just come on here and read some threads, that gives me a boost to not smoke, so thank you everyone! 

Hope you all join me in not smoking today! :)

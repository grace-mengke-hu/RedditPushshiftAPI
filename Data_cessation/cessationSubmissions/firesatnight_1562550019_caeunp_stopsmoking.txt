My SO is driving me crazy

So I am at about 20 hours smoke free and I really want to make this one happen. My SO, however, cannot wrap her head around how hard it is. 

First, she hates that I smoke, so part of my motivation is to make her happy; along with being healthier, living long, etc (all the normal stuff). Needless to say every few months it comes up again, i.e. the "when are you going to quit talk". I've tried a few times and failed and I don't know if she thinks I'm weak or what but it always makes her super dissapointed.

She is always telling me "you just have to do it" and that she has "had challenging situations in her life too" that she was able to overcome like school or something.

I try to tell her - she cannot possibly understand how hard this is without being addicted herself. It's chemical and emotional, physical and mental.

I try to warn her, I'm going to not be pleasant to be around the first few days. So today, as I'm struggling through day one of my quit, she starts giving me a hard time. Why did I lay in bed all morning? Why am I not talking? Why am I grumpy?

What do you do in this situation? She is taking what is already an awful situation and making it 10 times worse.

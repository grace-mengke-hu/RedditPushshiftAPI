This has to be it!

So I’ve attempted to quit so many times and this time I have to do it. 38(m) smoking since 18. Been feeling crap; sick of being out of breath climbing stairs. I want to be healthy and live a long life with my family. 

All the times I’ve quit before I’ve gone back to smoking within 24 hours. I’ve tried e-cigarettes, vapes, Allen Carr book and their clinic. 

I just don’t know how to keep it up and stay away from smoking. I don’t hang out with smokers. All my friends are non smokers

Any help or advice will be greatly appreciated

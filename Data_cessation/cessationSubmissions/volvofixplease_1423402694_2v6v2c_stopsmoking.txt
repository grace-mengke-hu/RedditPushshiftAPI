i know i will never smoke ever again

I had a dream in which I smoked just one cigarette,it was so real I thought it was real life.While I was smoking I felt dizzy in my head and so dirty and disgusted with myself.I now finally get it,there isnt such a thing as just one more-the concept is retarted and I dont even need to explain why.51 days in and I finally got the "revelation" Carr was speaking of.
P.S. just wanna apologize to bikeridingman,was a lil drunk that night but still unnecessary comment,love you all

An Addict is an Addict! :)

So I can finally make something cool with the origami. I learned it last night. Getting out of the shower this morning, I was thinking, I wonder if I have time to make another 'star box' before I go to work?! Really? This is what I used to do with cigarettes! 

I am 1/3 of the way to triple digits. That's pretty cool. And I haven't had a meltdown since Monday and Thursday is almost over!! It's getting better and better!!

:D

Edit: I got in a situation today that should have got me in an argument or made me want to walk out on my job...again. Instead I was the peacekeeper, and someone came up to me afterwards and repeatedly apologised! Win!

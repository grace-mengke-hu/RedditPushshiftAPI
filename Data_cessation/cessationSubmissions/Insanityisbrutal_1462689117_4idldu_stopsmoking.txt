Yesterday was a close call

After I had my tattoo I saw an old friend and we had a couple of pints, I started craving so bad, it wasn't a on and off thing it was there constantly, but luckily I didn't smoke, I notice that when I'm tipsy (has happened twice) and I don't smoke I get really moody and agitated! Does this go after a certain amount has passed?

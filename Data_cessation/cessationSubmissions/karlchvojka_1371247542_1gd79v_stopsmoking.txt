Tomorrow.

I have had a smoke earlier today, so I am not going to count it. I will not have one for the rest of today, but tomorrow will be the first full day.

I have a good consistent support network of friends to help me with this, and I have wanted to for some time now.

I have quit before, longest was 3 months, but that was for someone else, and it failed, badly. This, will be for me. 

Im done with it all. The smells, the cost, the excuses to go outside, the excuses for my habit when really none of them made sense anyway.

Glad I have a lot of gum :) Here we go.

Staying strong by staying active

Been 10 days now. I think shoveling snow for an hour and a half each day has helped with my lung function, therefore making me not want to smoke. Also, joined a gym that has kept me accountable and active. I know different things work for different people but keeping busy is a piece of advice I would pass on to all.

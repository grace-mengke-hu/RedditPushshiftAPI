Scumbag Brain...Day 2

Hello,

I am on day 2 and this is the worst, I am thinking of every reason to stop and get a pack to continue the disgusting cycle of self destruction. I am 32, I averaged about a pack a day for 15 years. I have 2 sons and a third on the way and I don't want them to see me smoke anymore. I also don't want them wipeing my ass because I am to sick with cancer.  My thoughts are angry and my mind is very foggy right now.  I would love to kick the side of my car. God I feel a little better now, thank you everyone for letting me vent.

Ken

Quitting cold turkey tomorrow. Please give advice on an issue I am having..

I have tried quitting every day this last week, earnestly. I always get tripped up around 10:30-12 am, when I feel like absolute shit, have no energy, and have to go to college courses. I guess I get really anxious but also I'm so foggy, so I relapse just so I can function. How can I combat this? I want to be free and healthy so bad... Tomorrow is another day, but I need help getting over that first hill. Thank you.

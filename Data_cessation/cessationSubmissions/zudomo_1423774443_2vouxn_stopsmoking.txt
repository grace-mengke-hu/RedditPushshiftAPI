Thank you and farewell

I think it's time for me to leave this sub. I'm confident that I will be able to continue on smoke free from now on. 

I've been out with friends who've smoked, been drunk, been depressed, and stressed. I think i can handle being without a cigarrette.

Thank you all for helping me getting through this. In the early days, I would literally spend around 3 hours a day on this sub just reading and posting. I know I wouldn't have been able to do it without all of you guys.

I thought about staying to offer support to people who are just starting out, but because I don't visit often, i often come late, and my advice would just be repetitive. 

Good luck to everyone here!

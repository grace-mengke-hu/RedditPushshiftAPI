First post, it's been four awesome days!

I've been lurking around /r/stopsmoking and reading success stories and horror stories, and horror stories that turn into success stories.  I have been smoking for 13 years...I'm also 25 years old.  The funny thing is, 6 days ago I had no thoughts about quitting smoking, in fact I had my cigarette fund tucked safely away in it's special pocket in my wallet.  Somehow after a couple hours of browsing youtube, I find [Allen Carr - The Easy Way to Quit Smoking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATo8X4DGWaI).  It really pulled me in because he's all like "By the end of this dvd you will be a non smoker. " And I'm like well I'm gonna smoke a cigarette while I watch, that'll teach him.  Then he goes "I bet you're wanting a cigarette right about now, well go ahead, light one."  I'm not gonna lie, I didn't stop immediately after watching the video, it took me a couple of days, analyzing how I was feeling throughout the day for a bout a day and a half.  Then I realized that the guy in the video was absolutely right.  I haven't had a cigarette since my first break at work last Thursday, and I haven't missed it.

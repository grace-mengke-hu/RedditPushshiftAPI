How do I help my uncle?

He's from China and he smokes a lot, and even though the box itself says stuff like "smoking kills" and "smoking harms you and those around you", he actually doesn't think it affects him. From what I can understand is, his rationale is that even though smoking is bad for other people, since he hasn't gotten cancer or anything yet, he's somehow immune to it. He said he's tried e-cigarettes and they didn't help, and I think he just doesn't have the willpower to try and quit because he doesn't want to go through withdrawal. Is there any way I can help?

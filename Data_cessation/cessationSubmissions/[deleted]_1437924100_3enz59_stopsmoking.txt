Just a hello and a little backstory.

Hello, quitters!  I've been smoking for 10 long years.  I had stopped smoking for January and half of February this year, but then I took it up again (stress is my #1 cause for lighting up).  This month my dad was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer and consequently, he has little time left with us depending on chemo and radiation next week.  He quit smoking cold turkey on the day he was diagnosed.  I've been trying to quit with him, but I have slipped up and smoked a pack in the last two weeks because ... stress.  I normally smoked half a pack to a pack a day, so I'm not beating myself up too badly yet.  I want to quit completely, so I don't have to lie to him anymore.  I'm hoping this sub will help me in the process.  It's been over a day since my last one, but I have a feeling this is going to be a long road since all I can think about is smoking.  Thanks for listening to me.

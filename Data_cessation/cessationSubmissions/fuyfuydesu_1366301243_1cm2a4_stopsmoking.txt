I've been a non smoker for a week today!

Hooray! This was easier than I thought! This is my 5th time (maybe more) trying and I've never gotten this far before. 
The other times I went down to like 1-2 per day, replaced it with swedish snuff and started smoking again after 3 weeks. 
This time I quit cold turkey and I can't believe I did it!
I was a smoker for 8 years and now I'm finally free!
Good luck to all you quitters!

Edit: And it I want to thank you all for this awesome subreddit! I've gotten all my motivation from here!

One Year!! Unbelievable!

Hello all! Well I never ever thought I would be here, typing this! Its been a whole year! And have to come, not to read about other people's awesome strength (which I do a lot!) but also to add my words of encouragement to those still struggling through. You can do this! This year has been the hardest of my life. I lost my mum and it was smoke related. So the fight that everyone here is fighting is so very important! DO NOT give in! Special thanks to Jonesey and My_vape_self. Your wise words always helped me! Keep on keeping on! Today I do not smoke with all of you!! Xxx

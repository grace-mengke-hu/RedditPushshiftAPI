Tomorrow is the date I set to quit

I've been making a film for the past couple years and during that time I took up smoking.  Some days get so intense that I just step outside for a minute and do something where I don't have to talk to anybody.

Tomorrow is my birthday and I've set that as the day I stop.  Really, I only smoke when I'm working, so I'm looking for some ideas to help me avoid smoking while on the job.  

Thanks for your encouragement.  This is really a great sub.

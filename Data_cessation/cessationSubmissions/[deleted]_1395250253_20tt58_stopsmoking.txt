48 hours smoke free for the first time in 10 years.

Small accomplishment I know, but since I started smoking in my early 20's (how dumb is that?), I've never made it a full day without breaking down despite many attempts and methods.  Just crossed 2 full days for the first time in 10 years and I'm proud of it.  Thanks for the support, reddit.

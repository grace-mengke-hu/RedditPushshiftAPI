MADE IT!

Ok, so thanks in a MAJOR way to the people on this sub for all the support- I went with my RN class to a overnight getaway in the western mountains in my state, and even though we were drinking (a LOT), I did NOT smoke! Not even a puff!!!  It was so weird!  I had NO desire to go outside and puff with the smokers, and today, as a reward for not smoking- NO hangover,(I'm not sure if the tobacco/nicotine really compounds the hangover effects, but I've never woken up after partying and felt this good)  and I was able to use the $$ that I saved on a zipline tour!!!  This sub is amazing, never before have I had the confidence and support to like myself enough to KNOW that I was better than the tobacco, and actually feel GOOD about quitting!!!  One more major hurdle CLEARED!!!  For anyone out there thinking that they can't break free from the addiction- you CAN, one day at a time!!  :)

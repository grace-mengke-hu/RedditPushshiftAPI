It's been 50 days !

Hey guys. I haven't been here for a while . I quit in December and just wanted to let everyone know it gets easier. I'll go through days without thinking of cigarettes. Cravings are just an annoyance since I know I will never smoke again. Read Carrs book and remember the cravings get easier. Since quitting I've been able to play sports for a long time. I don't cough up a lung every morning. Food taste amazing and the sex is so much better . Stay strong and remember cigarettes do nothing for you.

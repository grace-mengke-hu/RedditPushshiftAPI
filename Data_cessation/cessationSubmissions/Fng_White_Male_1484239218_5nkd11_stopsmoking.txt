Dropded my White Cell count from 15.5 per thousand to 8.8 per thousand


Normal is under 10 per thousand

My Dr ran blood tests for leukemia and were planning a bone marrow biopsy to find out what was wrong but told me it could be inflammation from smoking.

Quitting 4 months ago saved me a painful expensive procedure.

Also, my neck pain completely disappeared  

That should seal my commitment to never smoking again

Stopping today.

I'm 17, and i've been smoking for 3+ years now and today i've decided to quit. I don't **want** to quit, I like smoking, but I don't want to sacrifice my health for something stupid like that. I just smoked my last. Does anyone have any suggestions to help get through the first week?

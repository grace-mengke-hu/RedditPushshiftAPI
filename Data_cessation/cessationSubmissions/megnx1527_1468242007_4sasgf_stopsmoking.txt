Awesome Quit Smoking App

According to my app (Smoke Free - green & white with a check mark), I have:

Saved $48.11 ($2,738/year)

and 

Been smoke free for 154 hours (38 hours life regained).

The app is cool because it gives you daily missions to complete (that's how I found this thread), as well as badges for reaching certain milestones and shows you the health benefits and monetary benefits you've achieved by quitting.

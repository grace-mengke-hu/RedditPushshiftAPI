Got actual flu the day I quit.

So I was wondering if anyone has information on the immune system or general information about actually getting sick after quitting. I thought I had the "quitters flu" until my girlfriend actually got sick right after me. Mine started around 20 hours after I'd quit. I was at the gym and it hit me out of nowhere, started doing squats and felt fine, as soon as squats were over I needed to leave the gym. I've been sick for 3 days now and I'm wondering if the initial shock from quitting is enough to interfere with the immune system and actually get sick. I didn't smoke I used a ecigarette and admittedly I know there was much more nicotine in that thing than an actual cigarette which is why I'm also wondering if that made quitting worse for me. Sorry if this post is riddled with errors, still delirious from this flu.

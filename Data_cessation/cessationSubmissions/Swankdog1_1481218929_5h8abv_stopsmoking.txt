Anyone get sick when they quit?

Folks always talk about 'stuff coming up' as a result of quittting...and I feel like ive heard of folks getting a cold upon quitting, but I can't confirm.   All I know is that I am sick as fuck for the 2nd time since quitting and it sucks.

Any advice, apart from remaining clean and carrying on?

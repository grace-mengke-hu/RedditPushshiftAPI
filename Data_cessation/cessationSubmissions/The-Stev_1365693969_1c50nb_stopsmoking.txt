Day 3 baby!

I used to smoke a pack plus during the summer months. I realized there was a problem so i slowed down to just cigarettes when I'm drinking or when friends want to have a smoke with me, but now im done. i realize that the addiction could come back so i stopped completely. 2 and a half days deep and feeling great woo!

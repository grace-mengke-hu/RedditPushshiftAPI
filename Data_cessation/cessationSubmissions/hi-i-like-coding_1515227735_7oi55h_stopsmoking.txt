45 days nicotine free

It's been 45 days now, and it was well worth it. I stopped by to see my badge and remember how many days it's been, so I figured I would make a post.

My lungs still don't really feel fully functional, and I feel like I have a constant head-cold. While the cravings and all that are mostly gone, the ill health remains. Hopefully with time that will improve.

From this point, after 45 days, it's obvious that it was worth it, that smoking was a mistake to begin with. When I was a smoker, I was hesitant to quit, thinking I'd miss it, that I would need it, and so on... just the typical smoker reasoning. Well, now it's been 45 days and it's obvious that it was well worth it, and that I should never smoke again unless I *really* want to get stuck (again) in a pit of misery with little hope of escape.

I quit two years ago but had a drag last night.

Two years ago I quit smoking cold turkey.  It was rough.  I haven't touched a cigarette since.  Last night I drank wayyyy to much and I have a memory of me outside the bar coughing a drag from a cigarette out.  I don't know if I smoked the whole thing or just a drag.  Or if I had another (though that's probably unlikely).  My chest had felt tight today.  I'm wondering if that could be from the drag (or whole cigarette) or if I'm just being dramatic and the tight feeling in my chest is just me having anxiety about last night.  
Im also wondering if a cigarette could undo all the healing my lungs/body has done over the past two years since quitting?

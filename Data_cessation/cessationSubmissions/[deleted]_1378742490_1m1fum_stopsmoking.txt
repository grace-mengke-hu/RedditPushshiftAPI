I have cut back HUGE on smoking, and I have this wicked cough. Sounds like bronchitis. Can anyone help shed some light on this for me? Details inside.

I have significantly cut back on smoking (from 1.5 pack a day to less than 1/2 a day, and I have a wicked ass cough that gets worse not better. I know my lungs are healing but jesus fucktsticks. Every time I cough now, I have a few minute episode followed by throwing up. I sound horrible!! Trying to decide if this is normal, or if I should go to the doctor. It sounds like I have bronchitis. Anyone else experienced this or does my ass need to go to the doctor?

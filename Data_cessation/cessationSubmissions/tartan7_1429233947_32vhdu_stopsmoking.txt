Had to reset but quitting TODAY

After 4 months of being smoke free I bought myself a pack. And then another. And another..

Now I am resetting my badge and getting back on track with my life.

Went through a tough breakup and thought that smoking would help but it just made me feel worse. I had less energy. I smelt bad. I was chained to smoking areas. Used it as an excuse to procrastinate and ended up falling behind on my work hardcore.

NO MORE. This shit imprisons you and takes so much. I am tired of being a slave to an addictive, disgusting, cancerous thing that YOU pay for out of your hard earned money to make your life worse. 

I can actually feel how smoking these past two months has effected my lungs and my mental health. God, how could I ever go back to that..

Whatever. I am so excited to get this nasty shit out of my system and start being a healthy person again! :)

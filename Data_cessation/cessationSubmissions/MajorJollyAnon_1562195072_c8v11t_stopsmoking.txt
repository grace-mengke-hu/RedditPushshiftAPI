My family member died of a fentanyl overdose last night and I didn't smoke

I'm a few days shy of 400 days (nice round number). I was notified this morning that my younger cousin and his friend died of an accidental overdose last night. He wasn't a heavy drug user. He got a bad batch of weed that was laced with fentanyl. Both he and his friend died instantly. No time to even reaction. They probably didn't even know what was happening to them.

This was just a terrible accident. I'm heart broken in a whole new way. This was unexpected and a complete random death. But I still didn't smoke. I briefly thought about it for a moment. Smoking would never change the situation.

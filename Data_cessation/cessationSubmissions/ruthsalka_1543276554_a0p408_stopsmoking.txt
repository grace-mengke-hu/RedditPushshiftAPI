"I think we should trade in the car, Subaru has a deal going on, let's go after work" he said as he lit a smoke...

So that's a bit of a cheat on the exact conversation but the gist is there. I'm speed typing now because I've been in and out of the worst crave I've had since I quit 20 something days ago for the last 5 hours. Driving to the dealership in the old car "I want a cigarette." During the bargaining process, "I want  cigarette." Sitting in the minimalist/modern chair watching the salesperson who is less than half our age have a great time parrying with my spouse who gleefully admitted to loving that sort of negotiating...intermingled with fishing talk..."I want a cigarette." the blades on the gi-normous ceiling fan remind me of an airplane propeller. It's moving heat downward into he selling space. The sun has set and I know the cold drizzle is about to stare freezing onto our lovely new car and I want a cigarette. I know that they will talk fishing while I clean our stuff out of the old car in the freezing rain.  I have to do it. I cannot  let him do it- when we got a new fridge a few weeks ago, he was in charge of cleaning the old one out.  "Where are the apples?" I ask, looking into he new fridge.  "Did you give them to the chickens?" "What apples?"  I write a biggish check and I want a cigarette. It's part stress(financial) and part celebratory(sweet new 2019 ride).  Stopped at the grocery to grab something for dinner. "I'll be right in I haven't had more than a puff all day..." he says, lighting up. "Pepperoni?" I ask.     I got this.    Thank you for letting me vent, r/stopsmoking friends.  That was not my best writing but I'm getting over my jones. worst one yet and I DID NOT SMOKE.

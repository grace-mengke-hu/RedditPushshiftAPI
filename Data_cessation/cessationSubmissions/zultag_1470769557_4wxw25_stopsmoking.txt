Need help after 44 days

Hello everyone. I'm on my 45th day smoke free and I've been thinking of nothing but smoking for the last week.

The first month was surprisingly easy but yesterday I found myself smelling my girlfriend's cigarettes. The thing is, I would prefer weed over cigarettes if it was not treated as a hardcore drug in my country. I loved it when I tried it in Amsterdam a while ago. It made me forget about my anxieties and it didn't have the downsides of smoking cigarettes.

I'm getting ready to move to California next year to work and I feel like I could smoke weed freely there. I wouldn't even think of cigarettes.

Before I quit, I felt the guilt of "betraying" my family. My mom smokes and my dad doesn't. My older sister started smoking the last month and they were okay with it. They don't think it's a big deal.

So I feel like, I would quit for sure next year and this thought makes me want to smoke. It sounds really reasonable but I feel like it isn't so I'm begging for your help.

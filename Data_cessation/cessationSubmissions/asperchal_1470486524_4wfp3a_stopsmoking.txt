Quitting smoking and concentration

So, I've been a smoker for a couple of years now (I'm 17, started at 14, I know, I know). Because I made some wrong decisions, and because I have an addictive personality, I've ended up smoking about 3/4ths of a pack a day (up to a pack and a half sometimes). I wish I could simply quit smoking but I find lots of reasons as to why I shouldn't do it *right now*, though I'm quite sure I am just making up excuses for myself. However, I think these are some of my genuine concerns, and I was wondering what your personal experiences on these are:

* **Academic performance and concentration in general**: I really need a good GPA. While smoking does nothing for my concentration, not smoking certainly affects my concentration, negatively of course.

* **Friends and social smoking**: I'd say 99% of my friends and definitely all of my closest friends are smokers. This makes it nearly impossible to resist the urge when I'm in any social environment, and giving up on my friends because of a bad habit feels very very wrong. I think this is the toughest one to overcome, for me.

* **Stress**: I'm sure this is one of the biggest reasons people smoke, but I really wish I had some way of reacting to stress in a more positive way. Especially school- or work-related stress. A cigarette is the best way to kill stress, for me.

I have also been thinking about smoking less while not outright quitting, but will I really feel the benefits? Is it easier than quitting smoking, or will the urge be the same?

living with smokers while trying to quit

has anyone ever quit smoking while living in a smoking houshold? i quit cold turkey for about 6 months and loved not smoking but hated that i wasnt getting all of the benefits of it. i eventually started smoking again (ugh!) but badly want to quit! Anyone been in a similar situation? Any tips?

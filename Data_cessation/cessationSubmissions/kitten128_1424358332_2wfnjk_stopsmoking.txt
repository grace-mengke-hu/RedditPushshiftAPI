Day 2 and I am still hanging in there!

This is now the longest I have gone without smoking since I started 20 some years ago. I have tried to quit many times but never made it into day 2. Today the cravings have been harder and the brain keeps saying just have one, no one will no and it won't hurt anything. I refuse to listen. I take a walk. I work on some art. I drink some water or coffee or have a nibble of chocolate and get on with it. How are you all doing today?

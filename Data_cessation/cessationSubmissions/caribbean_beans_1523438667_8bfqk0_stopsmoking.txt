Quitting cigarettes yet again.

I have been a smoker for over 6 years and enjoyed it for most of this time. 

As time went on the negative health effects started to kick in and my wallet isn't happy about me smoking 15-20 cigarettes a day either.

My biggest struggle in quitting again, as I have done for a full 12 months before, will be that I use smoking as a coping mechanism for stress, days I feel down, you name it.

Hope to join the ranks of you long time quitters and maybe find some useful advice on here.

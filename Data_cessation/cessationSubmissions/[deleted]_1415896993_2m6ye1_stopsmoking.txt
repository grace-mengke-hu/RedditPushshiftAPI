All Alone

So this is it. Just had my last cigarette, from my last pack, from my last carton. And I'm just tripping the fuck out. Now I know I'm not having any withdrawals yet but my mind is playing tricks on me. 

I've been smoking since I was 15 pack or so a day; I'm 25 now, and i'm done. These POS have been enslaving my mind for years and every time I want to quit I keep hearing the "How are you going to deal with stress" thought pop up or the "it makes you look cool" bullshit. I just want to be free of this horrible habit. 

Now I need some advice from you seasoned vets out there (which are now my only role models). I don't want to patch, chew, or God forbid, smoke something else, just want out. All my friends smoke and family smoke. How Do I stop myself from going back down that dreaded road, up to that grungy store and buying another pack. I know my heart is set on quitting but my mind has a terrible track record. 

Btw, this sub is a huge inspiration for me, keep up what you guys are doing and rid the world of this cancer(literally). Hope to join your ranks soon!

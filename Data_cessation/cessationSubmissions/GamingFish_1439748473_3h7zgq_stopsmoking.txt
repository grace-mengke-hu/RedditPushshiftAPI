Anyone else unable to sleep during withdrawal?

I just went through a 80 hour period of no sleep because of withdrawal.  I went to the emergency room around the 60 hour mark and the doctor basically preached to me about drug abuse and refused to prescribe me any sleep aids.  I didn't mention anything about any drug and the first thing she started on was how Ambien was super dangerous and people kill themselves on it all the time.  She then went on to tell me that it was a thyroid problem rather than my withdrawal.  I know I just got unlucky and had a shitty person who shouldn't be a doctor try and treat me.  I went on to down an entire bottle of Jack Daniels and slept for 4 hours before waking up again.  

Now that I've got that off my chest I just want to know if anyone else has had sleep deprivation this severe because of nicotine withdrawal.  It seems for most that they end up sleeping more instead of less.  Being career military I'm used to 3 days with no sleep so I'm not too bothered by it and I'm not giving up, but I want to hear about your experiences with withdrawal and how it affected your sleep.

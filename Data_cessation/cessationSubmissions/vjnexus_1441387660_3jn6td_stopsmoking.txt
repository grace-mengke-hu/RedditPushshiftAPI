Month in, going strong. Just checking in.

So my badge is a little misleading, but not far off. I quit smoking cigarettes 34 days ago. I used gum as a crutch, but it felt stupid torturing myself with crazy withdrawal cravings every day as I tried to ween off the gum, so decided to just get it over with and quit the gum cold turkey about 5(?) days later. The first week was hell. The second week was better. The third week was hell again. Now it's starting to become a little normal. Don't get me wrong, I still think about smoking daily. I know that I can't have just one though, because it won't be just one, it will be the first. This is my most successful quit in 17 years. I had quit before for a few years at a time, but I still smoked when drinking or socially etc. Haven't had any nicotine at all this time. I have found myself drinking a little more lately though. Probably compensation, and I know I have to keep an eye on it. Stick to it everyone! Thanks for listening.

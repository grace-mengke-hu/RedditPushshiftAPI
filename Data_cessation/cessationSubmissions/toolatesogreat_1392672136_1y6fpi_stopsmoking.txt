"Social" smoking. Your opinion?

I went to a small party this weekend, which is somewhat rare for me. About 6-7 friends there were ex-smokers, but sometimes smoke in social settings. I think my SO was the only regular smoker at the party. Anyway, twice these people went outside and smoked/chatted and I joined them but I DID NOT smoke. I kind of wanted to, and I felt as though I could have without any problems, but I figured that being only 40 days in isn't enough time for someone to "just have one."I didn't want to risk it (plus, then I would feel like I was cheating and would have to reset my badge haha!)


So my question is, how do you feel about smoking socially, on rare occasions? Impossible? No big deal after having quit for a certain about of time? Should I just put the thought completely out of my head? Part of me is jealous, because I have all of these friends that I KNOW don't smoke regularly, but instead have 2 cigarettes at a party and call it a night.

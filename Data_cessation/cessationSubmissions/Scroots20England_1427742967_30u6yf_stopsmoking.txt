36 days and proud

Hi all, this site is truly excellent and is an inspiration for me !! I have managed a big party this weekend with lots of others smoking without caving in at all. I am so chuffed I have gotten over that massive hurdle, I am now sure I have cracked this. Ok, there is a long way to go, but I'm determined. I'm not smoking today !!!!!! Yay !!!!!!!zjBBVK

Thank You r/stopsmoking

I just wanted to share my story for anyone who is interested. Like many of you here I started smoking at 16. I am now 23 and throughout those 7 years I really started to hate it towards the end.
I found this sub linked from an ask reddit post and decided to check it out. This is where I heard about Carr and why quit and reading the success and failures of everyone here. I never though about educating myself about the reasons to quit, I just knew I wanted to quit, but it always seemed to end in failure.

I went out and bought Carrs book and the first time reading it I went 6 days without smoking before I caved. 6 Days! Even though it didnt stick that time I knew i would attempt it again very soon. I continued to smoke for a month before I tried again. I made it to day 9 this time without any nicotine. I was ecstatic. I have never been more proud of myself. But that night November 10th, 2013 I got drunk with my friends and made an awful decision to smoke again. HGJJGDSD! motherfucker. I have never been more upset in my life. "All this hard work for nothing" I thought. My friend was even worried that I might do something drastic to myself because of how depressed I got because of ONE cig.
So long story short I woke up the next day smoked one cig and decided this was it. I didn't need to read the book again I had all the info and just said fuck it I'm done!
107 days so far and not looking back. I still think about it everyday but not in a craving type way, but more so memories that are getting foggier and foggier.
So thank you stopsmoking. It may seem cliche' but I owe my life to you.

And I bought a bitchin motorcycle with the money I saved so far.

Getting harder after two weeks, has anyone had a similar experience?

Hey guys, 

I've quit 2 weeks ago. It was getting easier day by day; I even hung around with some smoker friends who were constantly smoking right in front of me and I wasn't moved much by it. However, for the last two to three days or so it is getting considerably harder not to smoke. I have cravings to smoke again; I've had more work to do than before, could that be the reason? Did any of you have a similar experience? What was the hardest part for you? Please share any advice you may have :)

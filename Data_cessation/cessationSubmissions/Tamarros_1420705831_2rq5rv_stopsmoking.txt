Holiday smoking

My friends and I planned a holiday to Amsterdam (to a month from now), before I quit smoking. 
Now I'm kinda bummed about not smoking there. 

Did anyone here managed to smoke over a holiday, and then not touch a cig once back home? my friends are really trying to convince me that it's okay, but I don't know if I trust myself enough to stop there.

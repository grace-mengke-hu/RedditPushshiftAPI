Deleted my flair

I had gone for two years without a cigarette until I left a job in Bangkok in July. I was there on a four-month contract (renewable), but it didn't work out. 

I didn't smoke through the newness of the culture and figuring out how to get an apartment, etc. Didn't smoke though the military coup. But ending the job just somehow did me in. 

I bought a five-pack on the street impulsively four days before I left and haven't stopped since. 

My cough is back and I've lost weight. Not sure how to get back on track.. I can go for hours (and many hours) without a smoke, but as soon as I don't have to go without I light up. 

Suggestions welcome.

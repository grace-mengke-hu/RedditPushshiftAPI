It gets so much easier...

Afternoon all,

Just wanted to repeat this to all those just starting out, or wavering within the first couple of weeks: it gets so much easier. Day 36 now and while I still think about smoking it's now once a day rather then once every 5 minutes. And it's not a dying hunger for it. It's more of a "Oh yeah, that" before my train of thought trundles along. 

In fact, compared with a) how I thought it would be before quitting, and b) how I thought it would be in the first few weeks, this is easy. 

So carry on with it! find the strength to keep telling yourself no. It'll all be alright in the end. And if it's not alright it's not the end.

Now to just sit back and count the cash.... 

Good luck to all.

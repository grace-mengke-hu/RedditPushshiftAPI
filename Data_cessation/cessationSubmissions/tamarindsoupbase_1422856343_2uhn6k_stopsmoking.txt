I ran my first marathon!

800+ days ago, I was smoking 2 packs a day for almost a decade. I decided to quit because I didn't like being crippled by my addiction. 

Started running to avoid weight gain and even ended up losing 10 pounds (thus achieving my ideal body shape and weight). 

The decision to quit really started an entirely new lifestyle for me and I hope yours would be the same.

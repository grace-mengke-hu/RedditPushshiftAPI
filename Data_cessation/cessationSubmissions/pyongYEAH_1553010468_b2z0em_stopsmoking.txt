Menthol free nicotine inhalator

So my dad got me this pack of nicotine inhalators to help me quit smoking and at first I wasn't so sure but I ended up loving them. Eventually I ran out and went to buy some more but every shop I go in only has them with menthol and I can't stand menthol. The one's I had initially were from boots and I'm very sure they had no menthol although I didn't check before I threw the pack out. 

Tl;dr Basically I'm hoping someone here might know of a supplier for nicotine inhalators without menthol (UK preferably).

Thanks in advance

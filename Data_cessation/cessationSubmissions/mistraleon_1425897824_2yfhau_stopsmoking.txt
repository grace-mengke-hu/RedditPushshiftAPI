It's been 20 days since my last stick!

It feels awesome! Most of the cravings are gone, and I don't feel like I need a cigarette to function properly anymore!

Something that helped me during the start was picking up the Kendama as a hobby. Whenever I felt like smoking I would practice the Kendama to distract myself! 

To everyone who's in the midst of quitting, don't give up!

Going smoke free for 30 - 6 days in

Like a lot of other people, no longer smoking was my new year's resolution. I'm about to turn 29 and I always promised myself that I would quit by the time I'm 30 (actually, originally it was 25 but it's funny how easily we push the quitting deadline back isn't it - I kept telling myself that I was still young and had time to quit).

Anyway, I'm 6 days in. I've been ill which I think has been a blessing in disguise as it's made not smoking much easier. I think it will be harder when I have to return to normal life (work, socialising, drinking alcohol) but I'm determined to do it.

What is your top tip for staying smoke free?

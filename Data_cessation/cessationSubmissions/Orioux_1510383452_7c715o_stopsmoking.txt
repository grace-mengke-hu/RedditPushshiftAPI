Hey guys,

So I hadn't smoked for the amount of time listed in the title. Key word, hadn't. I got kind of drunk tonight, not crazy drunk but a few beers were had, and me being the stupid gullible person I am went to the local circle K and bought a pack of Canadian Classics. I don't even really know why. My mindset was that I would buy a pack, chainsmoke for the night and then I hadn't had a plan past that. I smoked the first cigarette already and boy oh boy does it feel shitty. I feel light-headed, nauseated and honestly, really angry with myself. I knew that cigarettes were poison. I knew that the reason I wanted a cigarette was because of years of training myself to smoke them, and still I did it. I don't even know why I am writing this post; maybe to vent, maybe for some catharsis about what I just did. The point is, that for anyone at a similar time frame into their quit as I was, don't fucking smoke. No matter what. It's just foolish and I feel foolish. I feel like a child that has a temper tantrum but can't quite understand why. I'm an adult (I mean not really I'm 21, but I don't know when I can start calling myself an adult) and I would think that I'm intelligent enough to know better. I don't feel sorry for anyone but myself. I hope this can help someone else see how stupid smoking is. My life was so much better without it.

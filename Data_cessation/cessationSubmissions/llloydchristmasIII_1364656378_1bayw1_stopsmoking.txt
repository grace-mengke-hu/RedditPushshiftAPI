Day 3 - Barely Made it

Came really close to a relapse last night when my wife and I had a pretty big fight. I mean _really_ close, so close I'm not sure how I didn't walk to the store and buy a pack. 

But somehow I didn't, and I just passed the 72 hour Mark. I'm feeling really good about this. I'm feeling shitty about pretty much everything else but I'm glad I didn't smoke. I'm going to try to go running in a bit since it's a nice day. I'm grateful for another night without smoking, and I find that checking this subreddit fairly often has helped me a lot.

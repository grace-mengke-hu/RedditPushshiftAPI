3 months.

Reached my 3 month mark! I’m excited and so proud of myself but right now I’m going through one of those craves and a guilt trip to top it off.

I have been mentioning to my family for a few months that we should do a secret Santa this year for Christmas because we don’t have kids in our family anymore and buying all these gifts for each other seems a bit much (there’s 8 of us and the “just one gift” rule has never succeeded so we’re all stuck lugging a car full of gifts home that we all don’t actually need or want and bitch about a few months later——on top of everyone’s birthdays that happen all after new years to May).  I don’t need or want anything, don’t want people spending money on things I won’t use, and also don’t have money to spend on others as freely as everyone seems to think I can.  The fact that my rent has raised over $200 this year along with insurance and general expenses seems to fall on deaf ears, and all I get in return is “well you should make more money, get a better job” instead of understanding.  

A few people agreed with me though. 

Get home from work tonight and my nana has said this will be the last year for gifts, just cards next year.  We’re also thinking about renting out a room in one of our fancy mountain resorts instead and to start asking my boss about getting Christmas 2019 off so I can do this with everyone too.

So here is my suggestion of a simple family based secret Santa being blown way out of proportion, not to mention getting twice as expensive for everyone if we do happen to book these hotel rooms (not counting gas and what-other-activity-expenses-there-are-with-it) and I just really would love a cigarette right now to sit down with and say fuck it all.  

It’s a hard craving to resist right now, so I have to take it minute by minute. I guess it’s just one of those moments that I have to embrace and get through so I know I can do it all over again without smoking.  #NeverAnotherPuff

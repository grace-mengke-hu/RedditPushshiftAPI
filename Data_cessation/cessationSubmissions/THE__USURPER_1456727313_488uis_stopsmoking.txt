Weird anxiety/addict rationalization

Hey all,

I quit smoking 2 weeks ago.  I am 26 and have been smoking for 8 years.  Ever since I quit I get an anxiety that I am going to get cancer every day.  Strangely,  I never thought about this when I was smoking.  Then after the thought passes, my head starts saying "the damage is done, 8 years of half a pack a day, might as well go back"  Is this some strange addict rationalization?  Are my fears actually warranted?  I feel depressed that I am already screwed from 8 years of sucking on carcinogens.

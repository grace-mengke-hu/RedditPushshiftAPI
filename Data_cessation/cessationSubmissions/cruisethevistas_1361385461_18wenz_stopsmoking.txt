Here we go

I smoked off and on before graduate school, and then I quit for 5 years. 

A very tragic incident led me to pick one up last April, and I've been at it ever since. It's amazing how the habit is so easy to slip back into.

This ends now. No more smoking. Thanks to all for sharing your experiences.

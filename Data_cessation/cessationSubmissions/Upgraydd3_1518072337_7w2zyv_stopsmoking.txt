I've failed and hurt my partner

My fiancee has been under the impression that I have quit with her for the last month. The truth is....the truth is that I hadn't. I snuck a smoke her and a smoke there until I snuck purchasing a pack...then another. Tonight when I got home she was sleeping and I let the pups out for a bathroom break and had my illicit pack in my pocket. I don't know why she woke up but it doesn't matter, I turned around and she just looked at me. I knew I was caught. She asked me what was in my pocket and I told her.
Readers, she got angry. Really mad. She is embarrassed and disappointed in me. She says she isn't upset that I fell off the wagon but that I lied to her.
I, hopefully, am getting married in 32 days. Stress is not even an appropriate word, the pressure and stress seems to never end. No matter what I tell myself, the cancer stick seems to win out. I didn't smoke at my house and could, up until about a week ago, keep my secret only to work breaks. 
I have broken her heart, I have crushed my confidence. I would love to tell you that I am now stronger and will conquer this but I'm not. I'm weak, I failed, and I just can't get it.
Between work and wedding it never seems to stop. The only "break" I get is when I'm smoking. I tried nicotine gum, regular gum, exercise, trying to keep busy but the ahbit wind. Every. Fucking. Time.

I wish this had a happy ending but it doesn't, I feel doomed and trapped to this addiction. This addiction that is accepted but deadly.
I want to smoke again, I want my friend who helps the world disappear and my troubles go away for that 10 minutes but I can no longer have him.

I apologize for the length, I'm venting. I'm sorry if I disappointed the community. I'm sorry to my friends and family that believed in me. I'm the most sorry to my fiancee because I let her fight the battle alone though she thought I was there.

I'm so sorry.

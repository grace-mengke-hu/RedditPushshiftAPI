Quit day

35 years old. I’ve been a heavy smoker (read Nicotine  addict) for 19 years. I never decided to become an addict, but I have decided that I will not be an addict for the rest of my life. My quit starts at 9pm tonight.
 
My plan: 
Cold turkey- cigarette smoking addiction is composed of a relatively mild chemical/physical dependency which seems to feed a much stronger mental/psychological  dependency. Therefore my primary focus is recalibrating the way I think about smoking, while also countering the physical effects of withdrawal.
I am rereading Allan Carr’s Easy Way to Quit and also learning a new instrument while I quit. The book is the best resource I’ve found to understand how I think about cigarettes, while learning a new instrument is a healthy way to activate endorphins while nicotine leaves my body.

Routine:

Cut my caffeine intake by half- Nicotine causes smokers to metabolize caffeine at an accelerated rate. I don’t want to be wired and jittery.
Juicing- I know that Nicotine affects insulin sensitivity and in the early stages of withdrawal I expect to feel “foggy” as my blood sugar to oxygen ratio adjusts. My plan is to bring juice and other snacks with me to work and nibble throughout the day to counteract this.
Water- Staying hydrated is obviously important. I just buy a gallon on my way to work every day and finish it before I leave.

If anyone has suggestions I’d love to hear them. Smoking is ruining my life, and I’m finally addressing it. 



Routine-

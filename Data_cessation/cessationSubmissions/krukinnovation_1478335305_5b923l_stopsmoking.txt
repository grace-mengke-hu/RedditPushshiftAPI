My girlfriend quit smoking 4 months ago, still buys full packs when drunk/stessed...

She has been smoking for at least 8 years, quit when we first met but her brake often breaks and she gets cravings still so she goes to the gas station and buys a pack, or buys a pack when drinking, or stressed out, or feeling anxiety. People tell me not to worry about it but I am former smoker and I know that the cravings are only made worse by giving into them. What should I do? Should I support her and be understanding and let her be at her own pace? I can't really do anything I used to try and support her and say don't give in but then she'd get mad, so I'm trying to take a step back but it's like she has just cut down, not really quit. Nicotine is still a crutch.

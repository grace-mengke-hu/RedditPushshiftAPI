It's been just about a week

I know that it's "the addiction" telling me this, but I guess I need somewhere to vent - what I miss most about smoking isn't driving and having one, it's not having one after sex or a good meal, it's not having one to celebrate whatever, it's not having one to pass the time; it's having one at this time at night  (3:00-5am), during the winter, after I've been drinking/drugs while sitting on the bench in front of my house, staring at the woods, being the only person awake in the entire town, thinking about nothing and not knowing if what I'm breathing out at the end is smoke or my breath in the cold.

Anyway, 2 days ago I've joined a gym and was shocked to find out I could run 2 miles straight at a steady pace. I could do reps on the back machine without feeling that sticky, painful, layer in the bottom of my lungs. When I was gasping for breath from running, I couldn't taste tar - maybe a little, as it's only been a week, but this was the first time in 5 years I've physically exerted myself and afterwards felt great.

So, I'm heading to the gym after this post. I'm packing up that night-time cig experience and placing it in the same jar I keep my manipulative thoughts for ex-girlfriends *You don't want to catch up. You don't want to catch up. You don't need to call her under the pretense of getting coffee to catch up and try to get back together. She's awful, remember?* 

TL;DR - You don't want to call Lauren. You just need to remember her well, learn from the issues in that relationship, and find someone better. And take a lot of naps.

72 hours in.

I just reached 72 hours free from cigarettes.
I thought mornings would be the worst for me but I've discovered the time I'm struggling the most is after I eat a meal.
I'm sitting here right now after having lunch trying my absolute hardest not to give in to those horrible death sticks. 
Any support/advice would be helpful.

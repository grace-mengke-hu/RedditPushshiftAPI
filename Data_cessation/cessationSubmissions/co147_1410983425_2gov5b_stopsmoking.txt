4 days in and I lost the game again

Bought another pack of cigarettes today. I feel like a shitty person for doing it. I don't know what's wrong with me I guess I just don't have will power. Withdrawal isn't even particularly hard for me, just take it a day at a time. My craving today was extremely weak compared to those in the first 48 hrs after a smoke but somehow it still got me.

I'm what you would call an addictive personality, especially when the substance can be smoked. The rush from smoking is so immediately rewarding its difficult for me to ignore. I smoke weed habitually, and it definitely helped me attenuate nicotine cravings that would have otherwise caused me to relapse. But I ran out of weed today and bought a pack of cigs. What does this say about me? Obviously that I'm dependent on multiple substances and that my brain somehow justifies switching to the other when one type of withdrawal becomes too much, but thats the easy answer. At a more basic level, why can't I just make it through one week without any kind of chemical crutch? I drink a good amount of alcohol and I'm worried that if I cut out the functional high of THC and the buzz from nicotine that I may resort to alcohol to fulfill my itch for changing consciousness.

Do any of you have problems like this? What worked for you? Thoughts? Suggestions?

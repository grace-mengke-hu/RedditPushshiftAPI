11 days nicotine free. Just one question.

It has been challenging, but less than I thought. I've come to a place in my mind where I do not WANT to smoke anymore. There is no point to smoking cigarettes, it's the ultimate futile endeavor. Smoking has never helped me accomplish anything or helped regulate a stressful period, infact, the biggest cause of stress in my life was over not having any cigarettes left! Truly madness. 

Anyway, I was wondering what everyone thought of occasionally smoking weed? While still not good for the lungs, I smoke it so infrequently (maybe twice in the last 6 months) that I do not consider it an issue? Anyone else in the same boat? (also this would be smoking it without tobacco of course.)

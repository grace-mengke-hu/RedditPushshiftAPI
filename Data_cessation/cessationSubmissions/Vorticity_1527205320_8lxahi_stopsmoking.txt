I've been down to one cigarette per day for a long time now, but I can't let it go!

So, I've been down to a single cigarette per day for a long time now.  It's always a struggle to keep it to that one, but I generally manage unless there is alcohol involved.  I just don't know how to get rid of that last cigarette!

Sometimes I can even go a week without a cigarette, but eventually the cravings catch up with me and I wind up buying a pack.

Sometimes I feel like I'm going to constantly be fighting with this.  Will there always be cravings?  I don't even think it's just nicotine.  I actually enjoy the act of smoking.

Honestly, I'm posting because I'm not sure what to do at this point and am very frustrated.

I’ve been using sunflower seeds to quit and it’s working great!

It’s been 2 weeks since I’ve smoked and let me tell ya sunflower seeds have been a lifesaver! Every time I get a craving for a smoke I pop in a handful of seeds, I find it helps to put enough in that it hurts my cheek and gums and squeeze them real tight every so often to intensify the pain. Probably not the healthiest method but I’m sure it’s better than smokes. Just this trick could help someone out! Godspeed fellow quitters.

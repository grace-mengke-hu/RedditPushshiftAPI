Struggling

I quit last April and I'm having my first real struggle. I know it won't make me feel better and I know it won't change a thing, but I lost the love of my life last week and since the funeral all I want to do is chain smoke cigarettes. I know I won't, but I need to put it out there. This struggle is intense.

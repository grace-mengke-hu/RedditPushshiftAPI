First summer

It's my first summer (in over ten years) as a happy non-smoker. I now enjoy sitting outside doing "nothing". I enjoy sitting outside in the sun reading, because I'm not longer distracted by thoughts about when I can get my next cigarette. I can even sit outside simply lost in my own thoughts, in a way that you don't find yourself doing when you are inside. Just simply being, taking in the fresh air, listening to the birds chirping. I didn't really see the joy in summer before - I don't think I actually saw much joy in anything other than situations where I could smoke as much as I wanted, and then I ended up feeling miserable because I was... It's so incredibly freeing to know that no one or nothing has control over my thoughts or my actions anymore. I decide what to do and when to do it.   

When I go on vacation this summer I won't be going through withdrawal the first few days like I used to (I was a secret smoker, so I didn't smoke when I traveled with others). I'll be ready to enjoy the hell out of every minute I'm away from home, and when I get home I don't have to be jittery in anticipation of that first cigarette after two weeks without one. Oh my... what a fool I was. 

There is only one really annoying thing about being a non-smoker during the summer: When you have to have the windows open at work because it's hot, and people stand directly under said window smoking. That smell... ugh.  

I urge everyone who's struggling with being a non-smoker to look at their behavior now vs. their behavior as smokers. Keep doing that for as long as you need to, because the proof of why you should continue to stay away from nicotine is right there. Even though I'm utterly convinced I'll never smoke again, I'm still doing it on a regular basis because there are many "firsts".

Anger

On day 4, feel like it's been a month. Someone apparently changed every fuckn clock in my life to work on half speed. I can't shake this anger feeling, I'm angry about everything, I hate everyone. Things that have nothing to do with me make me mad!! This doesn't seem like a withdrawal symptom to me. Any thoughts other than needing anger management class??

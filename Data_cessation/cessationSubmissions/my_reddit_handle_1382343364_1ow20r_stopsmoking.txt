Eight Days In... and Feeling Grea... okay, fine, like shit.

Have I noticed my increased lung capacity?  Kinda, yeah.  Do I feel better about myself when I consider my prospects for the method of death?  Uh, sure.

But boy do I feel like shit!  I'd rather smoke a cigarette than almost anything right now.  I quit 'frozen turkey,' by which I mean I woke up one morning and decided to.  Am I screwed?  Should I surrender now and parlay my eight day adventure into a more realistic plan?

Aw fuck, I already know the answer.  Keep going as long as you can and you'll beat it, which I guess I probably will.  But does anyone else know what I mean when I say this is terrible!?

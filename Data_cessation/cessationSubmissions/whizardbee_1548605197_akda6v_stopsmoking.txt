How did you pick your quit date?

First post, on mobile, please forgive formatting.

32F I've been smoking for 15 years, (oof, just did that math now). I just finished reading EASYWAY and have been lurking on this thread for a while.

I'm ready to quit, but yesterday as soon as I thought, maybe tomorrow, it's like my cravings went into overdrive. I know this is all mental, but it's so strong and it's shaking my confidence a little.

If you have any advice on how to reasonably pick a date, and if those extra cravings happened to you too, I'd really appreciate it. First I thought a weekend would be easier, then I thought while I'm working I'd be distracted. 

Mostly I'm just incredibly nervous but also a bit excited.
Sorry if this is rambling, just looking for some encouragement I think.

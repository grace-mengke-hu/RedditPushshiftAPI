Day 1

Hello everyone,

Just a quick post. I started smoking in 2004, gave up for 8 months in 2010-2011 but due to the "one cigarette" I got back into addiction. Today (June 7th) I re-read Allen Carr's Easyway and broke +/- 25 cigarettes that I had and put them into the trashbin. I will never smoke again.

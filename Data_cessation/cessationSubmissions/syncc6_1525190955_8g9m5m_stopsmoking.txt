Trying My Best

I've been a smoker for around 10 years now \(3\-5/day\). Between now and then, longest break I've had was 3 months. That was 5 years ago.

I've recently decided that I would like to get rid of this bad habit for good. I got a wife and 2 year old son that I want to spend a lot of time with down the road. 

I've smoked only 6 the last 16 days and it's been 6 days since the last one.  I get the strongest urges when I am at work. 

I got the usual withdrawal symptoms \(crankiness, stress, headaches, lethargic\), but I was wondering if anyone experienced hair shedding? This one concerns me the most...go figure.

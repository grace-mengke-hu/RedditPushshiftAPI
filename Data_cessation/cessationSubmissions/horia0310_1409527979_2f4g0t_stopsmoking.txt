~1 week without a cig [UPDATE]

It's me again, with news :)
As some of you know I was the 18yo guy that smoked 1y&half that gave up. Quitting smoking gave me headaches, diziness, grumpiness but deep in my mind I knew this isn't good and it's all an ilussion, a dream.

I'd like to thank in this order:
-Myself 1st for realising this bad habit and stopping it once it for all
-Everyone here for greeting me, for helping me and for keeping my morals up
-Let's not forget about the little smiley badge
-And last, even if smoking isn't how anti-smoking say (which sometimes is pretty exagerate) I simply love my new life, I enjoy it, I smile more time, I am helpful and friendly.

PS: I eat a lot of chocolate but I am young and I got a nice metabolism :3 
PS2: I also go to the gym :)

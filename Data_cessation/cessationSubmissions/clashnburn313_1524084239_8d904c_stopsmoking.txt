Whatâ€™s the best part of not smoking?

Been only 16 hours without a cigarette, and I am finding it difficult to remember why quitting is important. I realize health is a huge benefit, but I am still young enough that it feels too distant of a reward. Any help on advantages of being a non-smoker or benefits to look forward?

Deep breaths

I'm watching YouTube videos about addiction, and the poster has added graphic stop smoking videos as commercials. I don't have tv anymore so I've never seen them. I've been quit over 5 years, but every time one comes on I reflexively inhale a huge lungful of air. Damn it feels good. 

For probably more than a year after I quit my lungs still hurt a little, and sometimes they even wheezed a bit. I'm well into middle age so I'll never undo all the damage, and maybe it'll still catch up to me. But I can breathe without aching, I can swim underwater, ride my bike up steep hills... 

I'm just so grateful. If you're struggling, just put your head down and persevere. You won't look back.

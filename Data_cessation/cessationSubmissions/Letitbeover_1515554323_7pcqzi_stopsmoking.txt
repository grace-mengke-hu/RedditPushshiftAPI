Help! Stepped down from 21- 14 mg patch and feeling rage!

Did anyone else
Experience this rage when stepping down from 21 to 14mg patch? I quit 29 days ago and have been relatively fine after the first few days, but noticed this internal anger and range since dropping to 14 mg a couple days ago. If you felt this too, how long did it last??  wow, I am so quickly set off by small things!!!

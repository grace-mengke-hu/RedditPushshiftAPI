Hard Craving Day 6

So I am on day 6 and for some reason it is hitting me hard. It is like my mind / body realizes I have gone six days and I (fingers crossed) will continue to not smoke so it is making one last ditch effort to draw me back in.  I would say this is my first real craving where I am thinking of excuses to go buy some. Help.

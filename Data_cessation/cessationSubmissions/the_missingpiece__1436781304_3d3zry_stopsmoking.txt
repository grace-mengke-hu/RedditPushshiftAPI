In my nine years of smoking, I never thought I'd reach such a milestone. One year down, a lifetime to go.

It was probably my 10th time trying to quit.  Started Oct 15, 2005, Quit on Jul 12 2014.  Almost 9 years of my life smoking a pack a day.  For some reason this time it clicked.  I used the nicotine patches as directed for 6 weeks, having no cravings whatsoever.  I cannot explain how proud of myself I am.  

I keep telling myself, if I smoke now, I'll return to where I started.  and when I was where I started, I desperately wanted to be where I am now.  

You got this.  I've done the patches in the past, but they always failed and I never knew why.  But this time I did something different.  On the day that I quit, I finished my pack at around 630PM, then immediately put on patch number 1.  This eliminated the whole "wake up cigarette" craving if I had waited until morning to start.  After that, it was all downhill.  I'm so happy to be a non-smoker.

You guys are a great community, and I know that each and every one of you can do this.  You have the power.

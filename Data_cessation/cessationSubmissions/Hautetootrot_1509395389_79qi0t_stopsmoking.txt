One year +

At this point, I very very rarely even think about cigarettes.  I feel amazing, my little colds as the seasons change have been so much easier to recover from, and my allergies are tremendously improved.  

I truly do not think I will ever go back.   I quit cold turkey, after a few failed attempts using a vape-pen or nicotine gums or reading Allen Carr's book on repeat.  The other times I tried to quit felt like torture.  This time felt natural and effortless (perhaps Mr. Carr finally reached me?).  The hardest moments have been:

-Business trips to the Shanghai area.  Smoking seems very tied to business meetings there, and is where I went from an occasional-smoker to having a few cigarettes in a row.   My job necessitates traveling there, and I have succeeded on two 2-week trips without cracking (though, I'm sure the second hand smoke didn't do me any favors)

-Nights outs with too many drinks.  Taking a break from a dark bar for brisk-smoky air outside is tempting, but I am getting better at being near other smokers

-My two sisters and mother all smoke.  A family dinner at moms could involve all three having a cigarette at the table.   I wish they would all cross over, but in the mean time, I am learning how strong my willpower can get.

Thanks to everyone here for your support and guidance.  Reading about other people succeeding made me see it wasn't impossible.

A good reminder

A friend and I smoked quite a bit of marijuana last night. This morning I woke up and my throat felt like death. This was the feeling I used to have every morning back when I smoked cigarettes. It's such a disgusting feeling, but you just accept it when you're a smoker. This served as a good reminder as to why I never ever want to smoke again.

I can’t sleep !

Does anybody know how long before I can fall asleep like a normal person?
After one day of no smoking I turn in my bed like a lunatic until 4am then sleep lightly for a few hours and up again...the second night same thing. And feeling and looking like a zombie the whole day. I never passed two nights cuz it’s so hard...plus i always fail in the evening...
Anybody has any remedy for that? When does it pass? I am so mad...makes me feel desperate...like I’ll never do it...my skin is becoming dry and full of zits...my body is really telling me to stop. I even feel like my brain works differently when I don’t smoke...
Please some advice!

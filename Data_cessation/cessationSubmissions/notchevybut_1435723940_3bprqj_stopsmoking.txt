I need help with motivation.

I'm 31/f and have been smoking since I was 19. I really don't want to smoke anymore. It's summer and hot and I feel like shit every time I leave my friends to go outside because I have the urge to smoke. My boyfriend quit six months ago and does not judge me for still smoking but I hate that gross hot feeling in my chest when I have a cigarette and am very aware of the smell when I come back inside. 

About four years ago when I moved from Florida to Colorado I was able to quit for four months and it felt so good - and I felt like death the day after I relapsed, but of course I continued. I want that good healthy feeling back. 

One of the problems is I'm not a huge smoker. I used to be, but it's evolved to the point that I only get a craving when I drink, which to be fair is most nights since I work in the service industry and naturally go out with my coworkers for beers after shifts, and that's when it gets me. When I went in for my last doctor's visit for birth control he asked how much I smoke, but since it's only a pack or two a week he didn't even give me the lecture I expected. 

I wake up every morning knowing that I should quit and feeling like I could - I'm terrified of lung cancer or a heart attack but as soon as I get that first craving or a coworker asks me to go outside  at night I constantly cave. As someone who has quit before and is more of a binge smoker as opposed to a constant smoker, do you guys have any advice on how I can get in the mindset of quitting for real?

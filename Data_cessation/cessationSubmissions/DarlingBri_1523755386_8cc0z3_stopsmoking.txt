160 days, lungs still hurt?

45, former pack a day smoker for 30 years. I haven't had a cigarette in 160 days. I vaped through month 1 but really just wasn't interested after that - I'd have a drag or two a week maybe, but none for weeks now.

My lungs hurt; there's a burning feeling on both sides on the lower half, on my back. Walking fast really hurts and I definitely couldn't jog or anything.

My doctor seems completely indifferent to this. Is this just normal?

Stop and smell the roses? Finally, I can!

I was out for a run earlier (something else I can do now!) and I noticed for the first time in 20 years that I could actually *smell* spring!  All of the flowers and trees in bloom, it was awesome!

Keep it up everyone, the grass on the other side of the fence is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO^âˆž much greener!

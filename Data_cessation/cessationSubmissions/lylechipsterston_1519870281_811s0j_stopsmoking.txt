Trying to give up

On and off for months...tried vape,patches ,gum

Went cold turkey for 2 days now coz I was getting weird sensations in my head...the same type of earache pressure pains when you are on a plane,and the top of my head feels like theres a gremlin trying to get out.

Any1 else get these 2 types of symptoms?

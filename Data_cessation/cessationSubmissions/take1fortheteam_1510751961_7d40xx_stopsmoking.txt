I can't believe I'm quitting

Alright so first thing's first, I highly recommend telling friends who smoke about this subreddit and having them subscribe to it even if they're not quitting.

I've been on here for a bit congratulating people who are in the process of quitting.

Now, maybe some of you don't agree with my method, but it's working for *me* and that's all that matters to *me* right now.

I bought a vape thing yesterday and I haven't smoked or even have urges to do so.

It's really hard to believe that I'm actually not smoking. After a few months I'll start weening off of the amounts of nicotine and then stop vaping altogether.

I'd appreciate some support and criticisms that I'm vaping are also welcome, haha.

Much love to everybody on here and I hope you can quit too!

Hopefully this lasts!

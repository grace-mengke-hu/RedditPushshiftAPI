Blunting of emotions

For the sake of keeping this tobacco related I'll try to skip as much context as possible. 

I recently found out how much this co worker means to me. She's leaving on Friday to go back home for good and so I'm losing a great friend. We hung out together for the time two nights ago, at her request, and the next day at work was just horrible. I was literally on the verge of tears for a few hours. She made me feel great just by being in her presence etc. etc. cliche etc. Also, I've recently been pushing myself to take fewer smoke breaks and so those first few hours were smokeless. 

Then I took a smoke break. And everything disappeared. All of that pain, all of that feeling, all of the emotion that was killing me but also making me feel alive, was all gone in a couple of drags. I couldn't believe it. I felt the difference and I wanted to go back into that hole I was just lifted out of by the flood of nicotine. 

She had said that she wanted me to quit, and I'm probably making a mistake by quitting partially for someone who mostly won't be in my life anymore, but all of this just made everything so clear. I have to quit. I gave her that pack. ~15 cigs and a lighter. 

Instead of thinking my problem through and coming to peace with it myself, cigarettes solved the whole thing by making it all irrelevant to me. Yeah, I was still thinking about it, but i wasn't feeling about it. 

Just wanted to share this with you guys. I've tried quitting a couple of times, but the last few days have made some negatives about my life pretty salient. This is my time. Four years as a smoker... I won't let myself make it to Five.

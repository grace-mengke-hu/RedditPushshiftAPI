Hey guys! It's my first day without smoking or any nicotine here!

I've been abusing nicotine in many different forms since I was a teenager; cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, nicotine patches, gums and pills. When I used nicotine intended as replacement therapy, it was never for that purpose as far as I remember. I just wanted to get some nicotine into my system without the social stigma. Unfortunately, it was still expensive and I felt myself being more anxious when using it. I've abused many other drugs (mostly alcohol), but I feel like some stimulants make me want to drink and use other depressant drugs just to calm me down. Anyway, I just wanted to write this down to introduce myself. I hope you have a good day! :)

No gear, beer or cigs.

Had my last fag this morning. Got an ecig and going to taper the strength down to zero over two or three weeks.

I'm also 24 days clean from an IV heroin addiction. Total abstaince from all mind alternating drugs.

Let's see if the 12 step program I've started can be applied to cigs. One day at a time.

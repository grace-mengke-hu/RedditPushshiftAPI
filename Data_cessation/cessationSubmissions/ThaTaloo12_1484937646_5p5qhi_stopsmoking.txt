20 days in!

I just realized tomorrow will be 3 weeks since I have had a cig. And really, I should be passed the hardest part. However, these cravings that pop up out of nowhere are surprising and pretty strong. I've almost given in a couple of times today. I have been able to surpass these cravings because I feel great. I'm breathing better, feel better, and have more energy. I believe these cravings are more because I enjoyed being able to take a ten minute break every now and then and smoke, but now If I take a break I really need something to substitute smoking with. Any ideas or advice?

Preparing for my quit day, tomorrow morning when I wake up.

Today is day 7 on chantix, told by the Dr. this is the last day I can take it and vape, so tomorrow I wake up and will not be vaping! Oh man is this going to suck, but I currently don't have to worry about work or anything for a while. All I have to worry about is not vaping. 

Going to have a lot of gum, healthy snacks around. I got a PS4 finally after all these years so that can keep me occupied at home. Other than that I'm going to try to spend a lot of time outside, hiking, going to the beach. 

I used vaping to get off cigs, now I've been stuck on that for the last 3 years. Time to fully pull the nicotine plug. 

Wish me luck gang, here we go!

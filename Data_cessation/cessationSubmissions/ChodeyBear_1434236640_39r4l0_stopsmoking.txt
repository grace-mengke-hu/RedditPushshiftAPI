One year ago right this minute, I put out my final cigarette.

Edit: top post, cool beans! I'm feeling elated :) I have had some major ups and downs but I've never touched a cigarette even when I've thought about it. Because I know that I never want to go back! Ps how cool does my smiley star look :)

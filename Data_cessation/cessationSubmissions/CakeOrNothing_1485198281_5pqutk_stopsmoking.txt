I just can't do it.

My partner and I both decided to quit and the day of reckoning was 2 weeks ago, He has not struggled at all and has managed to stay off the cancer sticks with the help of a vape. I have a vape to but all I can think about is cigs, I was fine to start with but within 24 hours I was feeling like I could sell my nan for a few drags on a cig, I went home and was desperately scrambling round for a stray dog end to puff on.
Since then I have continued to smoke, Albeit a hell of a lot less than I did but everyday I get that craving and end up either buying cigs, Or begging for a cig off workmates.

I think the main problem is boredom, I smoke mostly when I'm on my own. My mind starts to wander and thinking about cigs and before I know it i've nipped down to the shop and bought ten.
I don't smoke in front of my boyfriend and I can go hours and hours without thinking of them, Then I find myself at a loose end and bam, That's it. Or I have a stressful day at work then start thinking about them.

I'm really disappointed in myself, When I do have one I instantly feel disappointed with myself, Then I have another because I feel so shit.

I feel so pathetic, I really am trying my best but my best is not good enough, It's hard to see my boyfriend finding it so seemingly easy (though I'm sure he's not)
Has anybody else ever gone through a similar thing? I really want  to do this for my health and to prove to myself that I can do it.
Smoking is like a crutch for me, If I am having a bad day (and most days are) The first thing I reach for is the ciggies and it's been this way for years, I need to find something to replace this stupid habit, Please offer me your pearls of wisdom!

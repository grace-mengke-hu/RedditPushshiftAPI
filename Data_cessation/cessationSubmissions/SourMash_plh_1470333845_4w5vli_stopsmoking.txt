Day 7 - Every new day is worse than the last

Yeah, that has to fill you with happiness and wonder, knowing that each and every day without that insidious damn drug is actually worse than the previous day was.  You know, maybe not for you, but for me:  definitely.

Day 1:  Easy as pie.  Pissed for about six minutes in the morning, and aside from that, barely thought of a cigarette.

Day 2:  I should have quit years ago.  So.  Fucking.  Easy.  Smokers are lazy spineless dweebs.  

Day 3:  Oh, what's this?  A withdrawal?  That was bound to happen, I guess.  Not too bad though, I can deal.  I'm strong.

Day 4, 5, 6:  Are you kidding me?  I can feel every muscle in my body, and every waking moment feels like an eternity.  I can't carry money with me, or any means of getting money, because I know I'll immediately fail and buy cigarettes.  I don't even want to buy gas for my car.  I can hardly do my job.  I can't sleep.  I haven't had a shit in days.  I'm hungry.  Why can't I think of anything else?  For the love of God I'm hungry.  I just want to think about something that isn't cigarettes.  Anything.  I would love to dwell for a few hours on abuse I suffered as a child, just to change the subject.

Day 7:  This is my life, now.  Yes, it sucks.  Apparently, this is what it's like to be a non-smoker.  You're miserable, crabby, unhappy, and your only joy comes from a few fitful hours of sleep and your only hope is that you might take a dump by Friday, which is the measure of a quality week.

That said:  My willpower is Godlike, and I've saved like $40.  And, my performance at the gym, as related to the treadmill, is improved already.  So, I can run further, I can tell people who don't care how awesome my willpower is, and I can buy a pizza.  

That makes it all seem worth it.

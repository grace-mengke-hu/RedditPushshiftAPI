My Day 3

Hey guys, I'm on my successful day 3 of quitting smoking weed and cigarettes and about to go to bed. Before I quit I was smoking about 5 cigarettes mixed with 5 grams of weed out of my bong each day (poppers), and I feel like I need to quit both. 
Thing is I don't have cravings for cigarettes, but just for weed and I know that I don't want any tobacco - just a toke of weed. 
Give me some motivation on quitting weed and smokes- I have cravings that last 15 minutes every hour!!

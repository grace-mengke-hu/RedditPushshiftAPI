After a month and a week I think the holiday stress finally got to me and I was weak and smoked. I can't stand smelling people and think it's a disgusting habit. So I'm disappointed I gave in and smoked. I'm starting fresh again for the new year and changing my quit date. I hope u all stay steong!!!

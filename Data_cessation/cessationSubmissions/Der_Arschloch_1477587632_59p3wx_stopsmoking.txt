It starts today

I've just snuffed out my last cigarette 5 minutes ago. It's time for a change, and I can no longer kick the can down the road. Any words of advice and encouragement would be much appreciated. Good luck to everyone else quitting today, and those who are still craving! Let's go team 🎉🤘🏻

Android app that aided my quit effort.

Hi all,

Just discovered this sub and thought I'd share an Android app called "Get Rich Or Die Smoking" that really helped me.  The Google Play store has both free and paid versions.

You can monitor your progress in real time to see how much money you've saved, how many cigarettes not smoked, tar not inhaled and even has a chat room for communal support.

The greatest help for me was seeing my quit time growing in the "progress bar" display that shows percentage complete for various milestones (I'm currently 48% of the way to five years smokeless!). Whenever I had a serious urge to buy a pack I would just imagine all those progress bars going back to zero and it would help remind me how far I'd already gone and to not succumb.

Hope this can be of help to someone out tbere. Good luck!

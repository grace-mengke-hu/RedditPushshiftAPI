Motivation

Hey everyone,
I was wondering what gave you the motivation to finally quit smoking. I have been talking about doing for years and I feel that is a big part of my life. And I know all the risk and how much money I could save. That still has no affect on me. So I was just trying to see what made everyone quit and maybe that could help me get on the stop smoking track. Thanks everyone.

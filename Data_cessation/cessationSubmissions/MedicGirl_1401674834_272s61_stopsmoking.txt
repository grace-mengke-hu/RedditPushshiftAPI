Took the plunge. Need all the support I can get.

So, I finally did it. I haven't had an actual cigarette since Friday night. I have an E-Cig which has helped kill the cravings. I stopped after spending a night having severe heart palpations. It wasn't anything cardiac related, but it was enough to make me want to quit for good.

My goal is to slowly wean off the nicotine in the Vape over the next few months, but it's not something I'm actively planning on at the moment.

Any support would be greatly appreciated!

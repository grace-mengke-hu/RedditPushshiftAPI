Juul

I broke the habit to smoke cigarettes by switching to a low nicotine vape, and eventually cut the vape out entirely too. I was smoke-free for months and it felt great! 
Then my best friend introduced me to Juul... Being in the Marines, he was used to smoking cigarettes almost as regularly as drinking water, but he wanted to stop altogether. His ideology was to switch to a Juul first and then ween himself off of that, which I thought that was really good for him because Juul wasn't as harsh on the lungs as cigarettes. 
However, I made the mistake of trying it... and I was hooked. So compact, so easily accessible, 5 minutes to fully charge, and then ready for the day. Easily fits in my pocket, so obviously that's where it stays. I know it's not healthy and I know it must be hurting more than I realize, but the accessibility and odorless use makes it so easy to use without immediate consequences.

Examples:
Bathroom break at work? 3 quick puffs in the stall before returning to my job. 
A beer keg needs to be changed? 5 puffs in the keg room while moving things around.
We need some liquor from the back? 10 puffs between grabbing the bottles in the back room. 
These are some of the MANY opportunities I have each day to sneak a puff off my Juul for that nicotine buzz. Has anyone else experienced this Juul craze and found a successful way to stop using it?

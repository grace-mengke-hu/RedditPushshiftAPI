I don't like my favoured food anymore!

So I have been smoke free now and everything taste so different. I just want to know did any of you be surprised how different everything tastes?  I new it would be different, but wow... 
Plus question:  my pets treat me differently now and I wondering has that happened any of you?
Thank you so much advance!!!!

Today is the day.

Today is the day I say no more.
Today is the day I become stronger.
I will say no upon my first craving...and my second...and my third.
I will not let this rule me.

This is my official thread of quitting. For good.  I've smoked for almost 10 years.  I turn 29 on Monday.  I'm done.  I cough in the mornings.  My voice is sometimes hoarse.  I feel it in my back and when I lay down.  I have no energy. I can't believe I'm actually spending money to feel this way.

No more.  Right here, right now.  Cold turkey.  Last cigeratte smoked: 7:50AM 8/13/2015

Will post updates and my journey as I move along.  Will be updating this almost as a journal about my experience, craving times, ect.  Wish me luck.


*Edit/Update*
34 hours smoke free - Total cravings = so many I lost count.  This is incredibly difficult.  I feel as if I may cave any moment.  My stress levels are skyrocketing, but I'm hanging in there.  I want to grit my teeth and break something.  More updates to come...

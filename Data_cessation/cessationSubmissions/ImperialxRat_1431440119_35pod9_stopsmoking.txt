My longest Quit so far

Hey Guys,

I just wanted to throw this out there to help keep myself accountable.  So I am on Day 21 of no nicotine or tobacco and I honestly am super happy with my progress.  Pack a day smoker for 15 years, and this is the longest I have ever gone.  The first day I used a patch to get over that horrible first day hump, and after that first day have not used anything.

I have tried to quit about twice a month for as long as I can remember, and I don't know what is different about this time, but I honestly have only had like two real cravings since quitting.  I even had friends stay over who chain smoke, and there was zero temptation for me to bum a cig.  I really hope that this time is it!  I have not quit drinking or changed my lifestyle in any way, except I did find myself eating a bit of chips, candy, and junk food for the first week or two.

I am starting to feel a little weaker these past day or two because I'm unhappy about other things, but I have a little weekend vacation coming up this weekend, so hopefully I can breeze through the weekend and be at almost a month soon!

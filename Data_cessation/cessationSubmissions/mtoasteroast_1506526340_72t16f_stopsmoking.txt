Starting Day 3 - Still in secret

Smoked for 17 years, pack a day. I’m starting Day 3 and I’ve only told one person and that was a casual conversation with a coworker. 

I haven’t told my sister, whom I’m incredibly close too, nor my nephews who have been asking me to quit since they were old enough to know it was bad.  I’m incredibly close to them as well and my oldest nephew is turning 17, I started smoking the day he was born. 

I haven’t said anything to my coworkers and they are like my second family. I work at a hospital, 12 hour shifts. There’s a trust and understanding we all have to have in one another and that’s when we get close. They all have been pushing me to quit since I started working there 7 years ago.  

I haven’t said anything to anyone in my life, except a one-off casual conversation. 

I’m afraid they won’t see the significance of just trying, they won’t understand the heaviness of days 1,2, and 3. And it’ll be blown off and looked over. I haven’t really tried to quit before, so it’s not like this is a cycle being repeated. 

I’m also not sure if I’ve done enough to share.  Then I’m also afraid if I tell people and I fail....

I’m guessing this is part of the withdrawal talking, trying to make me smoke again. I’m doing it in secret but I’m on this sub a lot, reading past stories and new ones.

I’m also craving pretty bad right now, so sharing has helped it pass.

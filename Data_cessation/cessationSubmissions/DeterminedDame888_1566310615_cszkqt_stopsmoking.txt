Stopped drinking &amp; my next target is to stop smoking

I stopped drinking almost 4 months ago &amp; it was one of my best life decisions.  I'd like to quit smoking next.  I've tried before but a part of me didn't really want to quit.  I actually want to quit now &amp; joined this sub to help me with that positive life change.  

What helped you, when you first quit?  What method did you use?  How did you deal with the cravings?

I've been a smoker for almost 30 years.  I don't enjoy it anymore.

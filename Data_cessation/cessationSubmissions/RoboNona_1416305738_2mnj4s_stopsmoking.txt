I'm ready to be better!

Hi fellow non-smokers! I was a smoker for about three years, and I just passed my 48 hour marker and reset my badge! I've been trying to quit for about three months now, and while I've done a good job cutting back, I was failing. But I'm over it! I'm done being a slave to an addiction, and I'm done letting my biology control me!

Someone please tell me the anxiety will fade. I've been consistently nervous, that sweaty itchy panic of "I don't have any smokes" that was so familiar at the end of a pack has taken over every moment of my day.

Constant headaches

Hey guys, I stopped smoking a week ago. I have not experienced heavy cravings, however I've been having not severe but constant headaches for the last 2 days. I know that its a common withdrawal effect. Has it happened to anyone here? How long did it last?

Any advice to ease the pain?

Distractions needed during a strong craving

Apologies in advance for being a buzzkill. My gf of 4 years she told me she wasn't "super in love" with me, but she "appreciates all the support" I've given her - basically paying most of the bills and helping her through emotional issues (abuse). I've been cig free for over 2 months, but tonight's craving is off the charts.

Please send as many distractions as possible - pictures of dead lung tissue, pictures of your new cat, call me a pussy (in a creative way obviously), anything and everything is welcome.

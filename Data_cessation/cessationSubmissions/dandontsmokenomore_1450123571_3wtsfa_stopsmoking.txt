SOS: today I hit a wall

Yesterday, slow, lazy Sunday - not a single craving. Today, back to the real world, making ready to go home to my family for Christmas wherein I will be surrounded by booze and cigarettes and the sight of people enjoying them heartily. I know it's stupid, I know it is, but I don't know that I want to be different to my family and friends all Christmas, maintaining my will power. I feel I'll be sat on the edge of things a little. I mean, I'm still going to do exactly that, I just don't think it's going to be the super self-satisfied blast I imagined it would when I first decided that late November was an awesome time to stop smoking. 

Good peoples - if you've the mind and time to help a sorry addict out - I need your positive 'it's totally worth it' quitting experiences. When did your sense of smell start returning? when did your mood lift? When did your looks improve? How has your life improved?

I will read the comments till my eyes dry out and fall on the keyboard like little raisins if it keeps me from smoking.

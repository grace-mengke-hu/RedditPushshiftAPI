What makes you start smoking again?

I quit 26 days ago, and apart from the first couple of days things have been fine. Thing is, it's the first time I've tried to quit, but I keep seeing posts here of people who have quit for months and then fail, and that scares me a little

I rarely have cravings right now, and I don't really see myself starting to smoke again. So, to the people who started smoking after months of not smoking, what happened? What should I watch out for?

Looking to start Day 1, need advice.

Hi everyone,

I'm sitting here looking at my nearly empty pack and want to quit. I've looked through some of the other posts for help, but prefer a more personal advising.

I'm 21 now and been smoking since 15. My dad died 2 months ago and before he died, he and I were going to quit. With all the stress of him dying, my last quarter of school starting, and (now) ex gf troubles, I didn't have the mental readiness to drop it. I've tried before and did, what I thought, fairly well by just isolating myself from smoking environments (bars, smoking areas at college, etc.) but it just made me get depressed, because most of my friends are also smokers, so I was basically isolating myself from my friends. I live with my grandmother, a smoker, and she normally asks if I'll get her a pack when shes out so she doesn't have to go to the store herself, which is a huge temptation for me. I don't have ADD, but I feel like I have to be constantly moving, or I'll get anxiety and start twitching. A cigarette is normally the remedy.

If there is anyone else that has been in my position, shares similar antics, or has been through the same, how did you do it? What would you recommend? What good, besides obvious health concerns, has it done for you? How did you mentally and physically prepare yourself?

Any and all help/criticism is appreciated. I hope you guys can help be a driving motivation to help me quit. I want to quit and the sooner the better. 

**EDIT: Thanks for the advice and such! I wont say today is my 1st day smoke free because I was smoking at 6 this morning, but I have been without a cigarette since then, so i guess you can say that a full day is tomorrow. I appreciate you all! On a side note, I will be a freakin professional pen spinner by the time im done with all this. So. Much. Agitation.**

Only smoked for a few months.

      So I only have been smoking for maybe half a year but know it'll just get worse if I keep going. Do you ever get back to the feeling of before where you have no cravings or do you pretty much feel shitty forever. 
 I know someone's mom who was mad cool when she smoked and became a complete bitch after so that's partly why I'm wondering haha

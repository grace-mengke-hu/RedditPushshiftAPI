Day 69 #help

It was a shit day. Like the shittiest of the shit. I'd probably give my left arm for a smoke so here I am venting. Yesterday I felt like I was on top of the world with no cravings what so ever. I've come so far and I know relapsing will end in regret. Why is my brain screaming like the first day of my quit.  ðŸ‘¿ ps. I've had hard days in this quit, idk why today is different.

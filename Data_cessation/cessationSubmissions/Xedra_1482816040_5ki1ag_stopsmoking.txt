the headachesss / vaping

it's been about 8 hours since my last cigarette, i was smoking 5 a day for about a month, 10 a day for a week. trying to give it up now, had 1.5 cigarettes yesterday and half of one this morning-- but shit, no amount of advil or nicotine patch is fending off the headaches i'm getting. i have a vape pen with 3 mg juice in it, and binge vaping it for a few minutes is the only thing that has subsided anything at all-- no amount of advil or coffee does the trick.

my questions to you all are 1) how did you get through the headaches and 2) do you see vaping as a reasonable alternative. thanks for your time

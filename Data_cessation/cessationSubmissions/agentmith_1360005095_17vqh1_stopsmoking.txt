Question regarding those charts that shows how your body recovers based on how long it has been since you quit smoking.

This is the chart I'm talking about

I had not smoked for about a month and in a moment of weakness had one cigarette yesterday, and am curious if everything on the chart is reset back to zero with the same timeframe for recovery, or if certain things are affected more than others and I can expect a faster recovery time. It seems to me that the punishment subjected to one's body for a PAD smoker suddenly stopping, for example, is vastly different from someone who had one cigarette a month into their recovery, but I honestly don't know. I do have some residual lung pain, but don't feel too bad all things considered.

I can picture the smoke ripping through my lungs, killing off cilia and what-have-you, but I wouldn't think it would be any worse than a night of camping next to a campfire and breathing in the smoke from that. How does smog and air pollution factor into all of this, for that matter? If you are in a particularly bad area, which I am if the season is right, it's almost like faint second-hand smoke all the time. That has to have some impact on recovery and causing damage in it's own way.

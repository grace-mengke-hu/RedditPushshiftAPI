Nicotine

So, I'm watching "Mad Dog: Inside the Secret World of Muammar Gaddafi", because I find this sort of shit fascinating.

First interview of the show is with an arms dealer, who relays a story of Gaddafi and his crew showing up and asking for poisons. Topping the list is nicotine.

"What can nicotine do?" asks the interviewer.

"Kill you," replies the arms dealer. "slightest bit of pure nicotine in your system, and you're done."

It is little tidbits of information like this that keep me decidedly smoke-free and also contributed to my quitting in the first place, so I share with you all. Merry merry.

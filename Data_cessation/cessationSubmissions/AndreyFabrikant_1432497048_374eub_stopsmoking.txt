Just tell yourself "thank you"

I'm Andrey, 29 y.o. Smoker for 17 years. 
A few weeks ago I have found very interesting post on what people should like to say to themselves if they are able to jump back to the past. (Excuse me English, it is no my native language). According to the author of this post a hundreds people were asked. And the most of the told, that they would asked themselves to be the as more healthier as possible ( and to start deposit money). 
So I just imagined how I 45 y.o. will be appreciated to me 30 y.o for quitting smoking. How glad will I be that have done this in time. 

So, guys just try to imagine you 45 or 50 y.o. and decease you might have if not quit smoking now. Imagine your the background of your life in that time: a family, a children, your parents, your carrier and how big impact will have your health for all of these.

Here in Ukraine we don't have that high level of healthcare as U.S. or Europe has. Medical services are quite expensive and most of decease are not covered by insurance. So in case of cancer people know they will die and nothing will change this.

Whats the best way to start the quitting process?

I've smoked since I was around 13, in high school anyway. I stopped for about 6 months once just because i couldn't afford it. What is the best way to start? I tried vape but didn't like it, it just made me want to actually smoke more. I cut down a lot over recent years but i'm still around 5/6 a day. I'm more so thinking when I've been out with friends or drinking I can't go without a ciggy.

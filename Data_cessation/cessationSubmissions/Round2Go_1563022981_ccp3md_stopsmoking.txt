Boredom is a huge trigger.

I’m just over 4 weeks now. Got a drag off my boyfriends cigarette last night though. Being even a little bored seems to be a big trigger for me. Food is my secondary addiction, go-to. I’ve gained 5lbs. So I try to keep reminding myself how much I hated sneaking around to vape. And keeping it a secret from my family and work. And feeling way more nervous in general. There are a lot of great things about not smoking anymore. Anyway, I’m craving right now, boyfriend is asleep, and his pack of cigarettes are looking at me. Think I’ll post here and go for a walk

Advice on how to quit for good.

Hey all,

I'm coming here looking for help. I'm a six year long smoker, and it's time to quit. I've tried quitting twice now and nothing has worked. I tried cold turkey (I had an awful panic attack after four days and couldn't do it) and tried with an ecig and started smoking again after two weeks (and puffed away constantly for those two weeks). I'm not a super heavy smoker, usually go through a pack every couple of days unless I've been drinking.

I need your success stories. Inspire me to try something new! Give me all the advice you have. I need all the help I can get.

Thank you so much in advance.

I’m 2 and a half days in and I reeaaally want to crush it this time.

I’ve started reading the Allen Carr book again as it worked for 1.5 years last time. Been smoking again almost a year now and boooy have I had enough. It’s messing with my sinuses pretty badly and I just feel crappy overall. Posting to keep myself accountable :) 

PS. How do I get a badge? Is it possible on mobile?

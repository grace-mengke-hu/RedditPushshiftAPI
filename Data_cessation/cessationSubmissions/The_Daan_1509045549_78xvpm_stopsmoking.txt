Reading Allen Carr after starting to quit

I'm reading Allen Carr's "Easy Way to Stop Smoking" because it was recommended a lot on this subreddit. I already quit cold-turkey two days ago actually. 

I have a very stressful period coming up, and a lot of parties, both of which will trigger smoking a lot for me. Quitting is pretty doable so far, but i do smoke a bit of weed at night to go to sleep (no nicotine of course). 

I want to use Allen Carr's book, and from the first chapters it sounds like the ideal book for me. There is a problem, however. In the first chapter he says "It is essential to keep smoking until finishing this book".

Now, i'm torn. I know it's a terrible idea to start smoking again, just to use this book. I also know that this book probably won't be as effective, or at the very least a lot less interesting, the second time i read it. 

What should i do? Just continue going cold-turkey? Use the book anyway? Stop reading it?

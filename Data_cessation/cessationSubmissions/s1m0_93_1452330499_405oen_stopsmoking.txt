Not smoking in ten days, but still feeling heavy links when I wake up

I've stopped around ten days and even though I didn't touch a single cigarette (just vaping a couple of times) I woke up two times feeling heavy lungs.
It's weird because it's something that I usually felt only during weekends, after smoking a lot the previous night (it's been a while since I've just been smoking when I go out)
You think is it normal?
When it should go away this feeling?

EDITl Sorry for the error in the title, I had the dictionary on the phone :p

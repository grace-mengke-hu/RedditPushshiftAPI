Today is the day I want to Stop. Need advise Reddit. HELP

Hello Reddit.
So I have been a smoke since I was 12, I want to quit as I am 24 now and that means I have been a smoker for half my life. I live in New Zealand and the price of a pack of smokes is approx $18NZ. I have tried to quit in the past both cold turkey and via government sponsored programs. I need advise and as many of my friends either do not smoke or haven't tried to quit, I do not have anyone to really ask. All advise would be gratefully received. What worked for you? 

Help me Reddit, you're my only hope.

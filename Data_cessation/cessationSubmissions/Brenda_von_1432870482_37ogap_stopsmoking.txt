New to this community would like to start off by giving a tip that has helped me for over a month

So i have tried quitting many times in the past and this is the Best i have ever done. Anyway what has helped so much this time is herbal tea, brewing the tea takes about as long as going out for a smoke and the tea relives stress so it helped a lot with the smoking because I'm bored and i would highly recommend it to anyone having trouble.

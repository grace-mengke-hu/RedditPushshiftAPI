On my way to get an ex smoker!

Hi Guys, after silently reading your posts in this sub I finally managed to smoke my last cigarette in my life. 
At this time I am about 11h smoke free (hell yeah)!
Been smoking about a pack for 6 years straight. 

If you're reading this and still thinking about the decision to stop smoking - we can do it! We're stronger than this addiction! And most importantly, you're not alone!

I don't want to tell people I've quit yet

I'm terrified of relapsing. All of my close friends smoke. My parent smoke. Co-workers smoke. Pretty much everyone I know. I'm afraid to announce myself as a non-smoker because if I relapse then they know I'm a failure. I don't know why I'm posting this here I just felt like I needed to say something to someone about it. It's hard and it's eating me alive. I guess my phone is someone to talk to about it, right?

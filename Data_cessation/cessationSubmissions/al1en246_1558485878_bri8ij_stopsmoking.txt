Juul withdrawal/ flu sick

I’ve been smoking on and off 25 years. Vaping heavy 3 years and the last year a pod or 2 a day. I had a fever and swollen glands, diarrhea, aches, migraines, delusional etc., so I had to quit Juul 80 hours ago. The first 2 days we’re horrendous. Anyone else experience these nasty cold turkey symptoms?

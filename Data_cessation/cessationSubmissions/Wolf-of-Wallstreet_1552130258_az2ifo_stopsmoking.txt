Lung collapsed 2 days ago and had lung surgery yesterday.

Was traveling via air 3 days ago and my right lung could not handle the change in altitude which caused something to pop and fill it halfway with blood/fluid. Also been half a 10-15 stick a day smoker for the past 9 years which is also a factor.

Had the surgery yesterday to remove the rest of the blood and remove the remaining bubbles from my lung. Afterwards my doctor literally told me my lung looks like sh*** from smoking and I need to quit. I am 26. 

Luckily I’ll be okay and this is the biggest wake up call and I’m lucky for this second chance. Day 3 today, been in the hospital with a nicotine patch.

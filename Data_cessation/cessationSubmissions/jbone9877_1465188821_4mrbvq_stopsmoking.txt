No more hangovers

28 days without a cigarette tomorrow. Quit cold turkey. I was smoking about half a pack a day. I have gotten pretty hammered drunk a couple times since quitting and have noticed I no longer get hangovers since I have quit. The amounts I have drank would have normally given me a massive hangover the next day, but now that I quit, literally nothing. No headache, no dizziness, no nausea. Anyone else experience this? Just another great reason to quit!

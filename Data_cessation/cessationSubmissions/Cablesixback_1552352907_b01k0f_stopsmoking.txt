Help with my last five

I don’t crave all day.  I wake up, drink my coffee, do my PT, do my doctors appointments, take my meds, eat lunch, take a nap, wake up, do some housework, no cravings

Then I eat dinner.... then it strikes,  cravings like crazy.  I try to fight them.  I knit, I text a friend, I practice deep breathing, I rewrite my list why I need to stop, I have friends send my boobs (I need breast reconstruction after double mastectomy so I need to be a minimum of 2 months fee).  I try to put them off. But I fail.  Every night.  It’s like as soon as the sun goes down I can’t stop the cravings and I give in.  
I feel so guilty, but that doesn’t stop me from having another, and I feel worse.

During the day I can go out and do a little bit of walking with my walker, or drive a mile to watch the water.  But I can’t drive after dark.  So I’m home. And my hubby smokes, so I take one of his.  It’s the night time smokes I can’t stop.

I asked my doctor for patches, but he didn’t believe I’ve been cutting down (10 a day since November, used to be 1 1/2 pack a day for 20 years).  

And when I was pregnant I could just stop.  Now I can’t.  I make all the excuses, the cancer made me allergic to fish, seafood and alcohol.  It made me allergic to most medications.  I use cigarettes as a way to distract my self from pain.  But I see my doctor in May and it’s my time to ask to see plastics.  It’s been two years, but feeling whole isn’t helping me quit.

What can I do?  I’m out of time, but I’m still finding excuses...

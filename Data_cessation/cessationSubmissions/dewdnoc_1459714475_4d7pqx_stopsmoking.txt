Just a reminder. YOU CAN DO THIS!

Hi guys! I used to come here every day, multiple times a day. This is while I was trying to quit, and right after I stopped. I guess its like a breakup. At first that person is all you can think about, and then little by little it stops being as important as it was. At any rate, I wanted to check my flair, and thought it might be motivational to come in and reinforce that there are people out there who quit and stay quit. 

If you're reading this, I just want to remind you that you CAN quit. I did, and I never thought I could. Just because you may falter doesn't mean that you're not stronger than your addiction.

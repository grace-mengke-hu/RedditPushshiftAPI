9 days, 12 hours... Feeling great.

I began smoking when I was 15, and have smoked about 10 a day for these last 10 years. 

I tried to quit about a month ago, and it was really, really hard, even with an e-cig and nicorette. I was under a lot of stress, just moved to a new city across the world to live with my SO, trying to complete my dissertation, and I had been an emotional, irrational wreck. My poor SO just about nearly ran out of patience, and many arguments were had. I lasted two weeks, but slipped once and had one on a night out, then caved completely shortly after. 

I decided that the day I completed my dissertation, would be the day I had my last cigarette.

**Honestly, the *planning* of the day I would have my last smoke, *significantly* helped. I felt *ready* before I quit. And it's been a world easier.**

The first few days were hard, but not like the first time. Still a bit of emotional overreactions and being a little irrational at times, but I was able to level myself better than before. I don't crave just by smelling or seeing a cigarette anymore. I still feel a little sad about avoiding coffee and other triggers, not having that smoke after eating, but it's easier to ignore. 

I keep reminding myself that the cravings will pass. Whenever I get a craving, I do something different to what I'm doing - I get up to make tea, tidy a bit, or make a to-do list, etc. Still working on how to get through the cravings when I'm out - so if any one has suggestions for that, I'd love them. 

So it's been 9 days, 12 hours, and 47 minutes. I'm feeling confident about this, it's getting easier, and I'm happy.

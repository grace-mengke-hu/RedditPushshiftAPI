After almost a decade, I'm in the middle of quitting!

First time poster,

So happy I found this sub. I started at age 17 (now 26)! I'm about a week into quitting and I'm so proud of how far I've come. I recognize my triggers and physical habits and I've managed to mitigate them. One of my triggers was drinking and I wanted to celebrate friend's birthday with her so of course I had a few drinks. I was worried about how I would handle drinking and not smoking but surprise to me, I didn't like trying to smoke. The taste just absolutely turned me off completely. I can't believe that I would be like that since I'm usually fairly indulgent when I drink. I'm counting that as a total win against the nicotine monster, go me! This is my third (serious) quitting term. I'm amazed at my level of will power since I usually have none. Fuck nicotine!

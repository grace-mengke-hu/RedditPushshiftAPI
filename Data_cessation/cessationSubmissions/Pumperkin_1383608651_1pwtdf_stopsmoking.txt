Well this is different...

Picture this:  30 hours after I swore off smoking forever, I come home from work and find a single cigarette at my computer desk.  

Just the day before, I labored through my final cigarette and chucked the rest of the pack... or so I thought.  I honestly have no idea where this lonely smoke came from.  A month or even a week ago, this would have certainly meant the end of my smoke free-ness.  Not today, friends.  Without thinking much about it, I put that cigarette in the trash and carried the bag to the curb.  I might just make it after all, as long as I give myself the chance.  Feeling pretty proud of myself now, but not foolishly proud, because that would be... you know... foolish.

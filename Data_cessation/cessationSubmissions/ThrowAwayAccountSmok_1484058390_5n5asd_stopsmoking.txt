My First 24 Hours

Well, at 9 A.M. EST (around 10 minutes ago), my first 24 hours has passed without inhaling nicotine. I've been a heavy user for around 4 years know, and have just gotten **sick** of myself smoking. I started because I thought it was **cool**, but then stuck with it after a year or so.

Recently, I have started to **hate** myself for smoking - I wanted to quit, but I feared too much would happen. These past couple of months, I have seen myself always smoking because of the fear. It was so hard to see myself being a non-smoker, because I always imagined myself to be a smoker. This was **even though I was hating myself**. I wanted to be healthy. I wanted to be free.

I decided yesterday, after I woke up, I would stop before school starts again (Jan. 20th). Five minutes later, I decided noon of that day (Jan. 9th). Five minutes later, 10 A.M. of Jan. 9th. And finally, I said to myself, "I will take my last smoke after my shower".

I enjoyed that last smoke, at exactly 9 A.M. of January 9th, 2017. 2017 is the year of quitting for me. January 9th is the day of quitting for me, the last time I will let nicotine *control my life*. I hope never to touch such a disgusting substance again.

It has been exactly 24 hours, 17 minutes, and 31 seconds as of writing this sentence. The first day, after 9 A.M., I felt fine. Throughout the day, I would feel small urges to smoke, but I easily overcame them. It was not until around 9 P.M. that night I began to feel it. Anxiety, hyperactivity, had problems focusing. I knew I was in for a night. I went home early, popped one of my sleeping pills, and got ready for bed. I fell asleep after I focused on calming down, eventually, but was awoken at 2, 3, 5, 7 A.M., feeling very hyper, but calming down and falling back asleep. Eventually, at around 7:30-8 A.M., I woke up, showered, cleaned, and am now writing this.

I have so much more to face, to challenge myself with, and I am sure I can overcome the challenges. I am sick of being unhealthy, I am sick of not being able to breath clearly, I am sick of taking so much god damn time out of my day to feed my addiction.

So, it's been 24 hours. I'm feeling tired, anxious, wanting to smoke, sore, more tiredness, more anxiety, somewhat depressed, nauseated, almost threw up this morning. It's all worth it though. I encourage everyone wanting to quit to just do it.

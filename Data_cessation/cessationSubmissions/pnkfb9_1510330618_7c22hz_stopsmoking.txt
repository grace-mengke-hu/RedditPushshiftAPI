half a year!

just found out that I am cig-free for 181 days today! 
quick recap:

1st month -&gt; HELL

2nd/3rd months -&gt; purgatory

4th/5th/6th months -&gt; feeling good baby! no more cravings at all!

ahead for the year mark!

have a nice weekend folks :) and keep at it, you can beat your addiction

Eclipsed 30 days without even realizing it.

On my 3rd quit and longest one ive ever had. Nice to finally put it down this time hoping for good. Anyway I just havent really even been paying attention for whatever reason even being under a lot of stress I didnt even think of it. I'm quitting using patches and I know that has something to do with it. Almost on to step 2. Some might think using the patch is a shitty way of quitting but if I dont light up and im not destroying my lungs I'm all for it. Anyway I just wanted to say that it gets a lot easier.

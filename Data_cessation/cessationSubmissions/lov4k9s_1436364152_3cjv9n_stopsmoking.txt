60 days. Finally feeling good.

I was a smoker for 38 years.  I had a nightly ritual where I would sit outside with a glass a wine and smoke the night away while my dogs kept me company and I read a book or played on the iPad.  I LOVED my nightly ritual and I didn’t know what to do with myself for nearly two months after my quit, as quitting left a huge void that nothing seemed to fill.  I found the “void” to be very mentally uncomfortable and felt very out of sorts and discombobulated.   

I’m happy to report that the “void” has finally been filled…with normal daily activities and social activities.  Before the quit I was quite content to stay home with my ritual that was slowly killing me.  I am now motivated to try new hobbies and socialize more and have found that when I’m out-and-about I’m no longer in a rush to get home to my ritual, instead I find that I am more present in the company of friends and enjoy simple moments more as a result.

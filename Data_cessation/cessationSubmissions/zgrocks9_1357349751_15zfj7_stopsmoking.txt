Day 3-Still going strong! A quick thank you and acknowledgement.

I had my last cigarette at 11 AM on the 1st. I thought it was going to be hard for a couple reasons. One, I used to smoke on hangover days. And two, literally all my friends smoke, so I thought I'd be tempted but I stayed strong! Now that all the nicotine has left my system, I know it's all in my head but I know I can make it. This subreddit is the only reason I was able to quit. Thank you so much for all the resources and encouragement! I would have never know about Allen Carr's book if it wasn't for you guys. 

I'm done with these death sticks!

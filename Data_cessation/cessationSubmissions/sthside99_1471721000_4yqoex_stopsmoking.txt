I got drunk and smoked

I was at a wedding and struggled through cravings while watching all my friends smoke. I was fine then gave in just before going to bed at 5am which is annoying bc i almost made it. I've restarted one of my quit smoking apps and kept one that tells me how much money i have saved etc. I was 3 weeks smoke free now im 1 day smoke free, I feel like i might not be as motivated this time around does anyone have any advice on how to pick yourself back up after a failed attempt?

I'm done, I have no motivation and desire to quit smoking. I'm lost.

After relapsing 37 days two times recently  I'm tired, I'm hopeless. I don't know what I'm going to do. Life seems really boring and meaningless. I'm empty, I'm a living dead. I have been smoking for 7 years I tried to quit seriously many times but relapsed after a month every time. I regret the day when I smoked my Very first cigarette. Nicotine destroyed my life and still I'm hooked. I remained smoked free for last 28 hours and brought cigarettes and smoked again. It looks like I'm addicted to relapsing and quitting. I'm struggling and suffering because of my addiction to nicotine. Do I have any chances to ever be free from the slavery of nicotine?
Will I ever feel normal without cigarettes?
Has anybody ever been successfully able to quit smoking after relapsing many times?
My relapses were after 30 days most of the time. And I remember I have relapsed more than 5-6 times after going cold turkey for a month or so since when I got addicted .

Nicotine addiction is miserable. Once a smoker always a smoker. Shit!!!!sigh!!

Just shy of 60 days quit and about to crack

I am not sure how I am going to get through this day. Work is a total clusterf*** and I am NOT going to meet the crazy deadline issued this morning. 

I actually dropped everything to go buy a nice bottle of wine, and am trying to figure out how to keep working, don't get drunk, and do not smoke.

This is the first day in almost 60 that I've hit this particular trigger and I am soooo mad. It feels like my brain is on July 4 fireworks overload. I figure if I say so, maybe I will able to keep control of it/myself. 

:/

back at it

hey guys. long time lurker, first time posting. i quit cigarettes pretty effortlessly 6 months ago. a lot of the posts on here helped me keep going for a while. things got really stressful with family, i quit both my jobs to start a new job i thought would be better and it didn’t work out so i ended up jobless then i found out i had to move in less than 30 days.  and i gave in and smoked a couple packs over the past couple weeks and now everything in my life has settled but i’m hooked again. feeling pretty shitty about it and trying to tell myself these things happen and to get back in the mindset of not wanting to smoke again. but it’s harder this time around. looking to gather some strength from a group that helped support me when i doubted my abilities before. would appreciate any kind words or guidance.

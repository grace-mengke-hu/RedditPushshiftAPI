Is there a "good" time to stop?

I smoke about 2 packs a week. I have one more week of classes then some serious finals. I know I need to quit and believe that I want to, but just don't know if I can make it through all the stress of studying, etc. without smoking. I realize it's a rationalization to say, "oh, I'll just stop when it's convenient," knowing that it is never truly convenient.

I started smoking about 1.5 - 2 years ago and exercise regularly -- if that "counts" for anything.

Edit: Thanks so much for the insight/responses. Apparently there is a book I need to read, haha. I will absolutely check it out. I appreciate so much the call to action, but think I am going to make the serious push after finals. I will definitely be back to join the fight. Maybe until then, I'll work on "tapering," but I'm sure that's a whole different avoidance mechanism...

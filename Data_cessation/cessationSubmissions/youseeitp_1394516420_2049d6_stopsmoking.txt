One year club!

Just checking in.  It's been one year without a cigarette.  I quit this time last year.  It was hard at times.  But i finally made it to that one year mark.  During that first few days and then weeks, I felt a year was totally out of reach.  I can't believe that I have my life back.  I am so grateful for that.  To all those who hare having a hard time.  Keep at it.  I tried to quit for a year before I finally was able to gain any traction.

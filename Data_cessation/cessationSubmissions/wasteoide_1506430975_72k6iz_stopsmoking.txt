I'm not going to start smoking again.

But the cravings are bad now. Where did these come from? I dream of smoking and feeling guilty. I drive home, get 3/4 of the way there and BOOM enormous craving. What the heck? I'm not gonna cave, fuck that I'm doing too well... but how the hell can I fix a craving if I don't know what triggered it? It's scary as hell.

Also, yeah I know, can't even have 'just one puff'. That leads right back to pack-a-day smoking *every single time*.

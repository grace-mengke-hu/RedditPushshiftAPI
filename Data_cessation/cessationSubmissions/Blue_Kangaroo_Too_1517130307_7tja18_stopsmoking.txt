10 days!

And I can breathe!!!! After nearly 3 months of the same cough, wheezing when I breathed and feeling like my chest just wouldnâ€™t expand enough to get a proper lungful of air... I can actually breathe! Just lying in bed this morning taking really deep breaths and relishing all that lovely oxygen. A bit lightheaded now actually. Feels good :)

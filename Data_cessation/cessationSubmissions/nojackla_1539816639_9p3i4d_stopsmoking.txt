I stopped smoking 3 years ago and didn't notice till today.

It's been three years and a couple of months but I haven't been on this sub in a while so I forgot about it.

I just wanted to say that if you've just quit or are thinking about quitting, the rough patch won't be as bad as you think or last as long as you fear. In not very much time, you'll completely forget about it unless you're reminded by a friend or some other trigger but you won't want to smoke. You'll be a little startled that you ever smoked in the first place.

You can do it. You're probably way more awesome than I am.

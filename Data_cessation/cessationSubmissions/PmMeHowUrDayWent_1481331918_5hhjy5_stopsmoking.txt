Went to a family wedding yesterday. I was extremely close but I won.

It was my sisters wedding. It was amazing and beautiful and I loved it. However, I suffer from severe social anxiety. It's been a part of my life for the past 7 years.

I was feeling mentally exhausted during the after party, and was dying inside. There was a shit ton on my mind. There were several times when my family (almost everybody in my family smokes) would go outside together to light one up. I would go with them in order to take a break from the overwhelming social anxiety.

This was honestly the hardest day. I was so close to asking for one. I even asked my brother for a puff from his smoke, but he dropped it while handing it to me which ruined it. He made a new one to smoke, and in those few minutes that he made a new one, I had changed my mind and decided not to. I believe that him dropping one was a godsend for me. The few minutes of him rolling another one just saved me.

Now it's the next day, and I'm so happy I didn't cave. It's not worth it. 


I felt pretty bad for my brother since he dropped his smoke and I changed my mind, but he said he was more happy that I changed my mind and didn't smoke. My whole family roots for me which is very encouraging and awesome to have.

It's an uphill battle, but it does get easier and easier. Sometimes you have events like this where it is almost unbearable, but just remember, it will be over eventually, and to just try and enjoy yourself and try to keep your mind off the cigs.

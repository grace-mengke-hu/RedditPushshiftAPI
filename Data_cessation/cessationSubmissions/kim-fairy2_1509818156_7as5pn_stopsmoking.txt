Discussion: why do/did we smoke?

Hey guys,

I quit using Allen Carr's book and while it did help me a lot, I do think he didn't understand all reasons a person can have to smoke.

And in my opinion, understanding the real reason can make it easier to quit/stay quit. And I'm really curious what your reasons are/were :)

So let's discuss!!

So I've been brave and reset my badge from 33 to 9 :(

I have to say that at first I didn't think I needed to reset my badge.  Quit over a month ago after 30 years smoking on and off (mostly on) and was pretty stoked, but I slipped up twice, and also had a bit of tobacco in some spliffs one weekend - that's what I miss the most rather than cigarettes, and herbal tobacco as a mix just isn't cutting it.  Even after 30 days not smoking and over a week completely nicotine free, I'm still getting cravings and had a bitch of a one yesterday - nasty, drag you right down to hell type one.  I so nearly pinched just the tip of cigarette from a friend to put in a spliff when I got home, but kind of accidentally forgot to and therefore did not succumb.  Today is much easier and I'd just like to thank all my virtual friends here for your support and entertainment.  Dammit, I want that month badge back ...

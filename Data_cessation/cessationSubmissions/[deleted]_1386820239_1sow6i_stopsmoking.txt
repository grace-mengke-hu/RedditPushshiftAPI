Coughing stuff up around a week free?

Hey all,  

I know it's cold season, but I seem to be coughing up more phlegm and junk than I usually do; I'm not feeling sick at all so I don't think it's a cold. Is this normal for a non-smoker who used to smoke for ~5.5 years?  

thanks for all you do, everyone here, and happy holidays! <3

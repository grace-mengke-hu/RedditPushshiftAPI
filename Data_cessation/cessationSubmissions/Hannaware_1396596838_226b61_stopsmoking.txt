Searching for the last push and encourage to really QUIT!

I am almost 34, a smoker since I was 13, heavy smoker of 1+ pack a day. My lungs hurt, my stomach is suffering, my always soft and bright skin started to give up a couple of years ago already, smoking is expensive in most of the countries I've lived in, and to be honest, when I was younger, I would rather buy a pack of cigarettes than food....and to be really honest, that's what I'd do now too...just that thank God now I can afford both. 
I am scared. To have cancer, a stroke, or anything similar. I have high cholesterol since I was a kid (no, I am not over weight and I eat healthy-it is my genes that give me high cholesterol), and sometimes I could swear I can feel my veins and heart struggling to deliver and carry the blood around my body. I love sports but every time running costs me more and my lungs are about to rip. I have several mild health issues and smoking is not making them any better - the contrary!
So, why I still can't quit smoking?! Isn't the above mentioned enough to make anyone quit? I don't know. But what I do know is that I am still smoking, despite of all the above....

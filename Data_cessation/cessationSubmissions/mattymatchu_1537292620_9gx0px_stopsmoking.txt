Relapsed after over a year

I’m on sort of a work vacation. Bought a pack last night and have been bumming for like a week. I can make all the usual excuses but I won’t.  I have to move as soon as I get home. I feel really shitty and stupid. I plan on getting the lozenges once I get home and get in my new place. Any advice or encouragement is welcome. Thanks guys

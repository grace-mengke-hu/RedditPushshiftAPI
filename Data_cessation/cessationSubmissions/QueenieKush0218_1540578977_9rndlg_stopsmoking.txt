Nearly three weeks tobacco free and just finishing my last blunt.

I’ve tried to quit tobacco in the past but never did more than three days. I was definitely ‘ready’ this time and I’m so excited to work on my health and put my money towards better things. I’ve recently stepped down to a lower management role in work so life for me and my partner needs to be less extravagant. We were easily spending £500-£600 a month on weed, tobacco and papers etc. Crazy really. I’m planning to do a month sober from weed and maybe treat myself for Christmas but it’s definitely a special occasion thing from then on. I lurked here a lot and I have to say thank you guys for every post here, they all help!

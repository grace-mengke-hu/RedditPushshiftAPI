1 week CT

Will. I made it through to one week cold turkey. It was terrible for the first 72 hours but the day 4-7 were notably better. I don't get many cravings. I still feel as though I couldn't go out for drinks and still resist temptation, so, more work is to be done. I won't quit quitting, so there's that. I really mean it this time. I will post back in another week with progress. After that I will post monthly and finally annually. Thanks for the helpful words guys. Man of steel. The big rig keeps on going.

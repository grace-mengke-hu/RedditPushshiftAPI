I started smoking after almost 3 years of being smoke free

Guy that was my inspiration and my whole purpose of living and my profession passed away recently. As a result I started smoking. Wish me luck since tomorrow I am going smoke free again. What is 3 weeks of smoking you ask. I think everything but still nothing I kicked away that bad habit just to prove myself I am strong enough. Ironic since I took it by disgust and to "help" myself and now when I got hooked again hate it even more. I took cigarettes as "friend" and to replace emptiness in myself. I will be back on track really soon :(

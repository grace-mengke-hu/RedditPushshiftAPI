Day 5: I ALMOST caved in. Today feels great because I didn't!

So yesterday was a day I have really been dreading in this process: I knew I was gonna have to spend approximately 5 hours in a super smoky bar where I'd usually spend one day per week chain smoking with all my smoker buddies. So yesterday I was really unsure whether I should even attend this week. Maybe I wouldn't be "ready" for it. I probably wasn't but decided to go anyway because I believe restricting myself in any area besides smoking will only make me feel like I'm giving up more than some toxic shit nobody ever really needed. So anyway, I went and had some drinks and it got harder with each hour. I still knew I didn't WANT to smoke but I had the worst cravings ever. But I didn't accept a cigarette when it was offered me after I loudly proclaimed I could kill for a cigarette now and I didn't ask that stranger on the street for a cigarette on my way home when there would have been absolutely no witness to my failure. Yesterday was hard and I was probably getting on everyone's nerves and today I woke up feeling like I DID smoke a pack because of all the passive smoking. But that's actually a good thing, it reminds me of how I used to feel waking up everyday and it would have been much worse if i had actually smoked last night. Anyway, I am happy and proud. Last night wasn't a very "graceful" evening for me but I don't care as long as I stayed quit. I feel like I may have slain my biggest dragon.

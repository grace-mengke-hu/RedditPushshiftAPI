Day 1 - Here we go!

Smoker of around a pack a day for 13 years. Have quit a few times previously over the years, but nothing longer than about 4 months with Chantix once before. 

Well, I've hated this nasty addiction/habit for as long as I can remember. About 12 days ago, I switched from cigarettes to dipping tobacco to give my lungs a break, as I was dealing with some bronchitis. During those 12 days, I read and re-read Allen Carr's great book, and today, I jumped off. Threw out a full can of dip this morning, and henceforth, I am no longer a smoker/chewer.  Cold Turkey.

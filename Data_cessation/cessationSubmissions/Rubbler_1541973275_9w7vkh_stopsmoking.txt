Never thought it was possible

I really didn't think I would ever quit, had a few failed attempts(vapes or gum). Made it about a year once while in a relationship, that was ten years ago.  Well I've let depression sneak up on me for the last few years while I've been moving around for my job the past three years.  It all got out of control, the drinking, the smoking, other shit... doesn't really matter.  

I woke five days ago without any cigarettes, smoked them all the night before.  On my drive into work in a daze not believing it's Monday.  I feel like absolute shit and I have no cigarettes and I say to myself I'm not buying any.  Well I make it through my first day with not much of a problem because it's easy to not smoke when you're hungover.  Second day roles around and I still don't want to buy cigarettes. I have seen this sub before and I just kinda thought yeah whatever, but on this day I didn't want to think that. 

I poured through this sub, very inspired by all the post.  I found out about Allen Carr's Easy Way which absolutely blew my mind.  Changed my perspective so fast, I haven't made it through a third of the book but it changed my outlook so much I only read while having a craving.

Anyways, I'm five days in cold turkey.  I haven't told family or anybody else, not like family would notice since I'm on the other side of the world.

Any ways I want to say I love you all and thanks for the inspiration

When your mind says "It's not a big deal. Just have one."

This is my umpteenth quit, but it is my last. I've never made it this far, and it's never been this easy. Coming up on my 30th is probably what's done it. 

Anyhow, the tactic my brain uses (and I'm sure many of you experience this) to get me to smoke is downplaying the importance. "It's just one. Not a big deal at all". Once I have that thought, I'll often say out loud... 

"If it's not a big deal, then why are you trying to justify it?"

Puts things in perspective for me, and I hope it will for some of you. This community has really done a number on improving my well being, even if I'm only 4 days in.

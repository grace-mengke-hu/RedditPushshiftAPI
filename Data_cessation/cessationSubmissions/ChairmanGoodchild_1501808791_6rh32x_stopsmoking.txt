My method of quitting after smoking for 20 years. No smoking before a pre-set time. When adjusted to that that, move the time back by a few hours.

I started smoking when I was 18, and didn't quit until I was 38.  At that time, I realized I'd been a smoker for over half of my life, and I wanted to quit.

So, no cigarettes before 3PM.  I weaned myself of cigarettes in the morning and early afternoon.  There was no counting of cigarettes and no game-playing.  I could smoke as much as I wanted after 3PM, and I adjusted quite well to that.  After a few months, no cigarettes before 5PM.  Once again, I adjusted.  Finally, no smoking before 7.  At this point, I started losing tolerance to tobacco.  I smoked full-flavor Lucky Strikes, and they started making me sick, where I would be hoarse for several days after a relapse.  


That was two years ago. I know I've permanently stopped smoking, and I wanted to share my method.  Since I came up with it myself, I don't know if it's in widespread use or not. 

One final word of encouragement:  every time I tried to quit but failed, I was one step closer to success.

Read Carr, now a non-smoker.

Hello, 

&amp;#x200B;

This post is for anyone who's heard of *The Easy Way to Quit Smoking* by Allen Carr, and are still on the fence about a book that can help you quit. 

&amp;#x200B;

The fact it is written by a former smoker helps tremendously. He understands the struggles of being a smoker and wanting to go smoke free.  There's an expression I like: "Quitting smoking is easy, I've done it a million times". This was me. I would go weeks where everyday I'd wake up, wanting to quit, and be smoking by hour 3-4 of my day. It was mentally and physically exhausting. I had read Carr's book before, but not with an open mind. The book prescribes you to read it with an open mind, an once you do so It will work. Plus you can keep smoking while reading it - which makes it way less daunting of a read.

I just wanted to take the time to write this because I honestly think his book saved my life.

Much Love,

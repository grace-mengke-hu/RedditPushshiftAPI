I'm quitting...

I smoked my last cigarette earlier tonight. Wanted to buy another pack -- stopped myself because I have been thinking about quitting and I need to out of necessity AND shit's bad for you, yo.


I have patches and I've got one on. 


Here's to living a healthier life and saving money!

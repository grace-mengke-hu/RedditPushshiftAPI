Cat died last night.

My cat was a small cat and looked and acted young, just loved cuddles and that’s all he ever wanted. Last night I got woken up at 3am to be told he had a blood clot and couldn’t move his legs so had to be put down. 

I am not handling it well. Last month my gf and I broke up and this sub was amazing. I just need some kind words right now

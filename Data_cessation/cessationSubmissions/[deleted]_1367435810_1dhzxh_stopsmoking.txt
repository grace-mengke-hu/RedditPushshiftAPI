When do I start feeling better? It's been 4 months, and I still feel worse than before quitting.

I quit smoking at the start of the new year (1/3/13, technically), and my breathing is so much worse than when I still smoked. I'm STILL constantly cough up mucus, can hardly take deep breaths, wheeze all day, and wake up from coughing every NIGHT.

When does this ever end? It's been 4 months, and I wish that I could breathe as well as I could when smoking. I only smoked on-and-off for 4 years, and I didn't even have a cig every single day.

Edit: I have asthma and take all of my recommended medicine. I saw 5 doctors since quitting who put me on 3 different steroids (and more), which helped temporarily, but the side effects were causing emergency situations, so I had to get off them after a few months (they're not meant to be a permanent solution, anyway). How long did it take you to start feeling better than when you smoked? Years?

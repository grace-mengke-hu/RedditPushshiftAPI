How to overcome a comfort craving?

Dear ex-smokers of reddit.

I quit on the 28th of April, relapsed from 13th of may til the 19th. I relapsed because of stress and discomfort. Today at work I also feel a lot of discomfort and want to sort of “treat” myself to a cigarette because I feel bad. Food doesn’t give me the needed satisfaction and I don’t want to go from smoking to alcoholism. 

My roommate still smokes, so I would be able to get a cigarette from her, especially since we’re hanging out with friends tonight. But I don’t want to. So I need something to take my mind of things or satisfy the need in some other way.

What do you do when you feel like you want to treat/comfort yourself, which you would formerly do with a cigarette?

I'm 5 days in...

I was smoking on average a very low amount but it's more the time of day and habit of it all that used to get me.  Now I just stay busy. It was about 3 cigarettes a day. I've had some personal all stress and that didn't help either. 

My question is, when did the flavor of food come back? I noticed this morning that my eggs and coffee have never been so flavorful. Water is even sweet. Is this a thing? I'm only 5 days and 8 hours smoke free. Any insight?

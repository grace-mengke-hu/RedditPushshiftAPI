Badge reset day

I find myself here as a long time lurker and first time poster to make a confession: this week I kind of buggered up.

The last hundred days have been hectic to say the least; quit smoking, started on medication and therapy which have put an end to four years of crippling anxiety, began a fitness campaign to lose the pounds I've piled on over the years, the list goes on. And despite a couple of cigarettes in the early days I stayed strong and lasted through it.

Until last week, where in a moment of panic I had a cigarette. Just one, just to see me through. Unfortunately as we all know it's never just one and the last couple of days have seen me fall back into old smoking habits.

So it's time to start again. The 27th of October was a pretty damn good day to quit, but I'm certain today is a better one. So thanks to all of you posters whose stories motivated me to quit in the first place, and good luck to all of you who are just starting (or starting again!). We're all in this together, and we can all quit when we put ourselves to it.

My list

So I have been lurking for a while working up the courage to quit and finally took the plunge. I woke up yesterday with 3 smokes left and decided I wasn't going to the store for more. The cravings are rough, but so far I've come up with a pretty good list of things that they are better than.

My Cravings are better than;

* Fighting with my wife
* Spending thousands of dollars on smokes.
* Dying of cancer
* Smelling like shit 24/7
* Yellow Teeth
* Not seeing my kids grow up

When it comes down to it, I know I'm stronger than the nic fit. And thats about it.


Fuck Cancer

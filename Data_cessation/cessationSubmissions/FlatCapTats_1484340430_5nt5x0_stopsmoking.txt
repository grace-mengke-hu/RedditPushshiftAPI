Anyone else getting fat?

I'm doing okay with resisting cigarettes after 25 years of smoking, but I'll be damned if I can stop eating, especially sweet stuff.  Never had much of a sweet tooth before but I'm quickly turning into a sugar addict.  Two weeks of non-smoking and I've gained about 4 pounds.  I actually feel more unhealthy right now than I did as a smoker.  Anyone else going through the same thing?

Something that has been helping me

Everytime i get a craving i reach for my phone to take note of it and i instantly go make tea.
It has gotten to the point where as soon as i get the craving i reach my pocket as an instinct.

If i'm not at home and i can't make tea i browse this subreddit and look at my smoke free badges instead

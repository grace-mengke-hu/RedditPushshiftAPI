Checking in from the other side.

Over a year and a half smoke free.

Bad news: When I'm stressed and around other smokers I still have cravings.


Good news: Life is definitely better as a nonsmoker. It's easier, cheaper, and healthier.

My #1 tip: be proud of your badge, be proud of how long you have been smokefree. Reward yourself for doing the right thing.

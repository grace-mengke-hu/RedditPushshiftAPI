I’m ready.

I’ve been a smoker since I was 15 years old. That makes 20 years of killing myself slowly. 

I’m ashamed to say it, but since shame thrives in the darkness: I’m pregnant. I never ever thought I’d be smoking through a pregnancy and always told myself that at the very least, I’d quit if I ever came to be in the motherly way. Well here I am, six months in, and I haven’t stopped. 

Last year I quit drinking, and let me tell you, that shit was easy compared to this. The rewards and consequences around quitting booze were so immediate, so palpable and real, that it was relatively simple to stop. Smoking, on the other hand, is insidious. Cunning, baffling, and powerful in the words of AA. 

But I’m ready. I found out that I have a gene which makes me 2-3 times as likely to get cancer, and I want to live for my child. I want to stop hurting him. I want to be fully present for my baby. 

I’m sitting here smoking my last cigarette; after this I will become the good mom I want to be. 

Thanks for reading. Whatever comes, I will meet it as a non smoker from here on out.

I did it; I resisted peer pressure!

So I'm on day 14 of non smoking, and last night I threw a party with my fianc√©e and a bunch of friends. Later on, a few of them went outside to go smoke a cig. They asked if I wanted to join them, and when I was a smoker I loved smoking while drunk. But even in my drunk/high as shit state, I still remembered I'm quitting and was like "sorry dudes, I'm quitting cigs" and they were like oh no problem man good on you dude, and I felt proud of myself :D even in the car when we were driving around and everyone had a cig lit up, the secondhand smoke didn't bother me or give me a craving! I almost caved, but I stood my ground lol. I think I can do this guys! Can't believe I did it cold turkey though, no patches or nothing, just stopped smoking on my own...

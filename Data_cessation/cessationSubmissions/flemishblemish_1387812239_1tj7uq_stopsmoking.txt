I made it! 24+ hours down

My last (and quite anticlimactic) cigarette was Saturday night at around 7:30 PM. 

I know I'm not out of the red yet, but this is the first time I've successfully gotten though 24+ hours without smoking in a **long** time. I haven't even had any bad cravings yet.

Here's hoping I make it through both Christmas and NYE without a single puff. 

Thanks to everyone here on /r/stopsmoking for being so awesome!

I've got a cold, blocked up nose and tight chest.

First time I've been under the weather since I stopped smoking and I just want to say this use to be much worse when I still smoking. The tightness in my chest use to be unbearable where as now it's bad but no more near as bad as it use to be.

Another unintended benefit.

I think I just quit.

I planned to quit when I finished W3D3 of C25K. I did. It's three days plus a little now, and I've not actually wanted to smoke as such, but I'm going insane. I want to cry, bitch, get drunk, eat, sleep... Whatever, just to get away from this very stressed, uncalm, uncomfortable feeling inside. Any tips?

After many months, I had the dream again

I dreamed I was smoking.  And as always in these dreams, I had an overwhelming feeling of failure.  I thought the dreams about smoking had stopped, it's been almost three years now.  But I guess they will pop up every now and then.

That's when you wake up and think "Oh good it was just a dream!"

Relapsing hard

As the title says, I've been relapsing hard. The first time I quit, was for 8 months. Then one innocent day, I smoked a bit. It soon became "once a while" and then got out of hand.

Beginning of this year, I once again quit, managed to do 2 months, but relapsed once again.

I'm failing at this everyday and it sucks. I hate it, I hate smoke, I hate the heat in my throat, I hate the phlegm that I cough and spit out for hours after that smoke, I hate the taste, I hate the feeling.

IDK what to do. I keep failing hard :(

EDIT: Have sent an update request for my badge, to set the date to today. Looking at it is painful. Had I persevered, it would be 342 days today :((

Day 22 [terrible cough]

If someone were to tell me months or years ago that quitting smoking would actually make me feel shittier than I did as a smoker, I would have laughed at their stupid comment.

'How is that possible?' I would wonder to myself ... but quitting after 10 years as a moderate smoker [3/4 to 1 PPD] I am currently laying in bed wondering how it could possibly be true.

I have never had a hacking cough as a smoker- but as a non-smoker I seem to do an awful lot of it. I know the typical story, cillia in my lungs are cleaning up inside and it's causing me to cough ... WELL HURRY IT UP. I have spent countless nights just comfortably sliding into bed when a nice coughing fit creeps up on me. I cough periodically throughout the day in random bursts, but not very often and not as harshly ... but nighttime is a different beast altogether. I cough, and cough and cough until my lungs burn. I cough so hard at times that I begin to gag at the tail end of the coughing fit. This must be the terrible punishment I must endure for doing this to my body- and what a horrid punishment it is. I don't wish this on anyone.

I will continue to persevere, though, as I know eventually it was subside. I do hope it is sooner rather than later, else I may end up being a non-smoker in a wonderful mental health facility.

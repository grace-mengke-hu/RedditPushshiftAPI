Ello! I'm new here, any tips to get me rolling?

 Hi Stop Smoking! Just getting the ball rolling here, going to try out Chantix again. I am 30 and I have smoked since I was 13. I have quit quite a few times before, but never for more than a few months at a time, part of the issue was I had a SO who smoked and was never really into quitting. Now is the time! I wanted to see what has helped you guys? I am going the chantix route because my willpower is dog doo and it really worked last time, only stopped taking it because I was so dang agitated all of the time. Now I am divorced, and trying to turn a new page and kick the smokes for good.

My big go to is smoking while I drive, and I am buying my first brand new vehicle, ever, for cash.. So I think that change is going to be huge, not having ever smoked in said vehicle, and having no intention to. 

So let me have it guys! What helped you the most?

Well shit.

I smoked tonight.  It was my 20yr high school reunion.  Which is not an excuse,  just a bad reason.  I had two cigarettes.  I enjoyed them,  I got a little high from the nicotine in fact.  I'm grateful it was only 2.  I actually considered buying a pack,  but didn't,  which was smart.  It was eye opening that after 2 and a half years it was so easy to smoke,  it was smooth and not gross or harsh on my lungs.  Cigarettes are so bad for you they make your brain think it's easy to smoke. 
I remember that it was so hard to quit because I was full of the fear that only addiction can cause.  I'm kind if glad I smoked,  I know now how all of this is a choice I made.  A choice to live free and healthy.  It's a choice I'm proud to make. 
Sincerely, 
Day 1, again

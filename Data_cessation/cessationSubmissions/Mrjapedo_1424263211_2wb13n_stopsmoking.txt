DAE snore worse now that they have quit?

I smoked for around 13 years. During that time, every so often I would decide to quit with no success. I would always end up smoking when i drank, which sparked me to smoke the next morning. This time I quit Thanksgiving Day (USA) and I have not smoked since, not even when i drink. Before I quit I never really snored too bad. It seems now I snore every single night. Its gotten so bad that my girlfriend ends up sleeping in another room. Has this happened to anyone else? What have you done to stop snoring so bad? Thanks in advance!

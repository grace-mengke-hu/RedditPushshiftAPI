Day 4. This time for he who rides the whiskey...

and me of course.

On n off smoker for 12 years. Mostly on. I've quit twice before, once with patch, once with champix. This my 3rd quit, this time cold turkey. This just tells me i can never have a casual relationship with tobacco. 

Thank you to whiskeyrider and all others with good knowledge and genuine care and empathy for us struggling to slay the beast. I see you bro, commenting on all posts giving good advice. Its appreciated. 

Anyways day 4, been stuffing my face with chocolates and snacks etc. Drank alot of Cranberry juice first 3days so hopefully physically nic is out. Did 20 on my exercise bike yest for a dopamine fix now that theres less of that. Will do another 20 today. I really hope that after 14 days that feeling of 'something missing' subsides. 

Thank you all

Love from South Africa.

Day 0 // journey

Created a new account because I don't want to let any of my friends down. Set my badge to begin counting at midnight.

I plan to create a post every day, filled with banter to distract me from smoking and to have something to reflect back on.

I don't care if anybody reads these. This community is great regardless and has helped me quit for periods in the past.

I want to begin with a little backstory. I am a 19 year old college student and I have been smoking for 2 years. I picked it up to help me cope with a 5-year relationship that was born straight into rock bottom and never improved. I was manipulated and mentally destroyed by a very mean girl. As a result I was diagnosed with general anxiety and panic disorder. Been dancing with alcohol and depression since I began college. To put 5 years into a relevant sentence, she fucked me up from the inside out and cigs are a lasting hold she has on me. Tomorrow I let that go.

See you tomorrow.

First day, wish me luck!

Hey everyone. I've been an on/off smoker for about 4 years. I recently moved to China, which has seriously exacerbated my smoking problem. Smoking culture here is pretty prevalent, and is certainly very common among my close friends. 

I've enjoyed smoking from the start. But I hate knowing what I'm doing to my body/health and to my looks (wrinkles? Yellow teeth? Blehhhh.) 

I'm not going to be able to make any of my friends/coworkers stop. There will be people smoking around me all the time, and it's going to be really, really hard. 

But I'm very happy that there are resources and communities like this that exist that will help me along. 

Best to all of you.

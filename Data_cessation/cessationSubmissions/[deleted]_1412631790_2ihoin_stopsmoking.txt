Found Grey Hairs... Quitting.

There is a lot I've got to work on yes.   No doubt about it.  I am 28 years old, currently unemployed, currently not doing as much as I can with my life no doubt.  

6 months ago a friend noticed a couple of grey hairs on my scalp, and ever since I've noticed more and more grey hairs starting to come in.  Although I know I can't reverse them.  I do know they are somewhat caused by my unhealthy lifestyle.   

I am quitting.

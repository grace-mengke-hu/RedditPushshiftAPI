2+ weeks! Still having cravings though, when do they stop?

Hi. I got kind of lucky with my way to quit. I had to move in with my mother. I didn't want to deal with her possibly finding out or being upset if I smell like smoke so it didn't even feel like an option. I had been smoking for about 9 years, highest amount was probably 2 packs every 3 days. Maybe not that bad, but I have asthma so it wasn't always easy to even just smoke a cigarette. Stupid to start but fuck it, not the problem right now. 

I've quit before but started again because of being thrown in a super stressful situation. Well, I'd take *that* situation over being here with my mom now so I'd say I'm doing rather well this time!  

Luckily stress doesn't feel like a trigger but boredom still does. I can push them away but I just want to know when/if it ever just stops happening. 

I'm not going to stay here forever and eventually will be back with old friends that are smokers (and honestly, huge triggers!) so I'm worried on that. 

One good news for me today was talking with someone who smoked and asked me if I smoked (which may have led to a cigarette offer) but I told him I quit and while I thought about asking anyway, I didn't. Yay me. 

I haven't told anyone really about my quitting smoking thing, so I feel like I need some more encouragement to continue lolol. I don't wanna be reminded about how bad it is for me though, so I don't even really know how I wanna be encouraged hahaha. 

Thanks for reading this if you did. :3

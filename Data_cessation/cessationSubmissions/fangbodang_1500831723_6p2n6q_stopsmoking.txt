I've only been smoking 4 months... want to quit but worried it's too late and I'm hopelessly addicted...

So I've been smoking a pack of american spirits daily for 4 months, and i've never felt as fatigued and out of it and fuzzy headed than this. How addicted am I at this point? How much harder will it be to stop if I keep going? Should I expect pretty serious withdrawl? A cig is the first thing I think of in the morning. Ive tried vaping but it doesnt give me the druglike narcotic hazy effect of the cig. Thanks

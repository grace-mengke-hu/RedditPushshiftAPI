Day 6

Days 4 and 5 were pretty rough, but I made it.  The cravings are lessening in intensity and frequency even though I am using lozenges.  But holy hell, that wake up in the am craving is strong!  It lasts a while too, through my coffee.  But, I will finish my coffee, have a lozenge, and get to work for a Sat shift, sans cigs.  

It's nuts how much better I am breathing, tasting, smelling, sleeping already!  Let's all get through another day as nonsmokers!

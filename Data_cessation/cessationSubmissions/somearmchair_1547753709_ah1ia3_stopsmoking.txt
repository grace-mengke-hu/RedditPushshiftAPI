How to unsubscribe from Smoke Free App

i've done the monthly subscription to the Smoke Free App for the pro version, but I want to cancel it. I never intended to subscribe and I don't need it. One problem, I can't find out how to unsubscribe and I have seriously looked everywhere... Deleting the app doesn't help, and under "Membership Status" there is only "pro-user"and no manage subscription interface or whatever. Really frustrating. Any help?

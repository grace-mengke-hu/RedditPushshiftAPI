Stopping smoking today after smoking for 3 1/2 years as I take resolution to have better health.

I am 24 years old and been smoking since college along with friends . Now that I stay alone most of the time I have been addicted lately . So I take a commitment to not to smoke a single puff in life and I am going to stick with it. Thanks for this subreddit for motivating me to take this decision .

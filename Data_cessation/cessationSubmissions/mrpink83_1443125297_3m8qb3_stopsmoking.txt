Feeling good today about my teeth!

Yesterday was my last day at the dentist getting my teeth fixed.  I had 2nd molar pulled and 4 cavities filled.

I have been going for a little over a year, once or twice a month for cavities filled + cleanings + total of 4 molars pulled.  I'm happy that its all done.  

I'm happy I quit smoking so now hopefully my teeth will last a lot longer and I won't need to go to the dentist more than a couple times a year for cleanings!  My dentist still wants to put a couple crowns on, but I have a while (less than 2yrs) before I'll need to do that.  

Save your teeth while you can!  Or if you already have bad teeth, and you've quit smoking, set an appointment to get your teeth cleaned and a plan to get what you need fixed.  It sucks having to get so much dental work done because of something so pointless (smoking).

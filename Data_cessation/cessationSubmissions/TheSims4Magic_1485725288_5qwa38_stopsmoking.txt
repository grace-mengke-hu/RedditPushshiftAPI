Did you experience any shortness of breath?

I quit smoking cold turkey 1 month ago and everything is fine except for this extremely annoying sensation of not being able to breathe properly. I read some things about this online but I also want to see what other people say about this. In addition to feeling the need to take deep breaths but not being able to, I also feel like I need to yawn but cannot complete the yawning. So, I am asking you guys if you ever felt this way and if you did how long it took for you to get over this sensation.

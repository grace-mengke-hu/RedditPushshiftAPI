First cigarette in two weeks was very unpleasant

First, I'll say that the length of time I was addicted/have abstained pales in comparison to most of you. You guys are an inspiration. 

I've smoked cigarettes periodically when drinking for about 5 years. Two weeks ago I was smoking regularly, between 5 and 10 cigarettes a day, and had been for about a year and a half (I'm currently living abroad, which exacerbated the habit). I decided to quit cold turkey on a Saturday morning, two weeks ago today, after a night out of especially heavy chain smoking. I've wanted to quit seriously for a few months, with the mindset that I definitely don't want to be a smoker forever (for example if/when I become a parent) and quitting will only get harder as time goes on. 

It was hell for the first week, with less frequent but still very intense cravings the second week. I was also fixated on the fact that I wasn't aware I was smoking my last cigarette when I did; I didn't have the opportunity to savor it. 

While out drinking last night I decided to smoke a cigarette. The experience was so unpleasant I didn't even finish it! The head rush I used to crave...the head rush that used to put me at ease...it was totally unsettling. I went straight to the restroom afterward and scrubbed my hands because I couldn't stand the lingering smell. I feel liberated today and even more convinced that I've kicked that habit for good. 

I hope this anecdote might help anyone who is romanticizing that "one cigarette." Good luck!

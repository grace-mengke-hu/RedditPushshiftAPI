I stopped smoking, but it's affecting my studies ... Dunno if it's worth it anymore

I got passed 2 weeks. My roommate smokes from the window a lot, and we live in the same room. Since I used to do that too, I am not gonna ask him to stop. My second problem are my exams, I skipped a question that I knew the answer too. My concentration is low, and I am starting to get bored since all my friends are smokers. I just realised how empty I am. Low performance, bored, and very few friends. I am getting kinda depressed...

am I addicted to the nicotine, or the dopamine?

I've read Allen Carr's book and questioned the "psychological benefits" of smoking. I see that cigarettes don't calm a restless mind or satisfy a bored mind. And I've used nicotine replacements because I thought I would go back to smoking from the withdrawal. But none of that has really helped, and I went and smoked a cigarette even after a day of using the nicotine replacement. I was still missing something. And I think that's the dopamine hit. I only get it from physically lighting a cigarette and inhaling that first burning drag. It's more than just psychological, and yet it's different from nicotine withdrawal in its hold on the brain, and Allen Carr doesn't really address that at all. Does anyone know what I mean and have any advice for the dopamine withdrawal? Because it totally kills my motivation to do anything when it pops up. I could probably weather it easily if I had no responsibilities, but it feels like fuel my brain needs.

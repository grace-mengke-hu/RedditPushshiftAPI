Weird Sleep Issues. Anyone else?

10 days in. By 8 or 9 pm i'm exhausted no matter what time i wake up so I get in bed, fall asleep by 10pm-- then i'm awake at 2am. What gives? 

Also, when I woke up tonight my mouth tasted like cigarettes or tar, anyone else experience this or know why it happens?

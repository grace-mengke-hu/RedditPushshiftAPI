Day 11 and what did I go and do this morning?

Got up at 7am and went for a mothafuckin' RUN, that's what!!

Apart from the obvious chest and lung improvements, this quit has also affected my sleep in that I keep waking up ridiculously early and can't get back to sleep. This morning I decided to take advantage and start the lovely crisp sunny day in a nice active way, now that I'm not choking myself every morning. The quit has been getting a little easier day by day and I'm feeling fantastic at the moment so just wanted to share :)

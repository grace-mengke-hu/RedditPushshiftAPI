I smoked 2 last night

I was on the phone with a friend from college, we used to smoke together and I was on the porch talking to him. I still have some left over from when I quit about 2 weeks ago, I should throw them out but I haven't. 

Anyway, starting over, not that worried about it since I went 2 weeks without but wanted to be accountable here.

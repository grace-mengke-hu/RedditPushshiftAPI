I have no support and feel like I'm disappointing everyone when I "relapse", but I know I can do this.

I've been quitting on and off for about 6 months now.. In December I went two weeks without smoking, twice, but I had support then because I was home for Christmas with my bf, friends, and family. When I got back to university, I started right back up and basically doubled my consumption to a pack a day. Sometimes I'd plan to quit and go two or three days but it never stuck. This week I really wanted to make a serious effort and quit on Monday. I lasted until Wednesday. And then quit on Thursday morning and lasted until today.

I know I'm ready to do this. I know I want to do this. I have many ideas for dealing with cravings, but I just don't do them consistently. The worst is I have no support here. No one smokes in this friggin city and so when I say for the 10th time I'm going to quit, friends just say "again?" and that's not exactly helpful.

So I thought I'd join this subreddit. I have been lurking for a long time and realize I need some support from like-minded people. Seeing all your progress and success is really inspiring!

I am dealing with the side-effects from my efforts this week - insomnia, constipation (which I think is why I've gained 4 lbs in one week). But I am feeling better than any of my other attempts. More hopeful, more determined, and less scared. And I am actually enjoying when I'm not smoking. I have read Allen Carr's book and my downfall was not truly believing my assertions. And specifically of thinking that just one wouldn't be a big deal.. After all the binge smoking I've done in the last months when thinking of quitting, I know that's not possible.

So hi :) This is surprisingly my first reddit account, so any tips for this subreddit (~~subscribing?? badges,~~ etc) would really be appreciated! I will get to finishing reading the sidebar now.

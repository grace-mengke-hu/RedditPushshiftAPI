Smoking messed up my teeth

So, I'm 20 days into my second attempt at quitting. This one is a lot easier than the last time because of my teeth.

I went to the dentist about a month ago and they told me how much I had messed up my teeth. I have since had three teeth removed and haven't had a cigarette since.

For those people lurking on here still thinking about quitting, please quit so you don't have to have three of your teeth removed...

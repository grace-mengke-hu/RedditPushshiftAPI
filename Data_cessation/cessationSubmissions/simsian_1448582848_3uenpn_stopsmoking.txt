Using a cold to help quit

I've been smoke free since Monday afternoon. Every winter I get two - four month long colds that turn into bronchitis. Vomitt, chest pains, bronchial asthma, the works. I've been wanting to quit for the past couple of months, and usually make it a day or two smoke free before I cave. 

I've had the past four days off, but tomorrow I go back to my high stress job where most of my coworkers smoke. I can finally breath through my nose for the first time in months. If I start smoking at work again I'll get sicker. If I miss much more time I risk losing my job. 

Wish me luck?

The extent of your control

So I was curious to ask some of the quitters over here. I quit over a year ago, and really haven't looked back. I eventually got tired of it and just... stopped. It was hard for about the first week or two, but after that, once I stopped thinking of occupying my time with smoking, I stopped.

My question is if some of you guys have come back to smoking but on a passing basis. For instance, in the past year, I have probably had 10 cigarettes in total for various reasons. Sometimes I just want one for the purpose of nostalgia, sometimes I want one because I am having an abnormally frustrating day and I want to use it for a 5 minute break from life. Regardless, since I quit, I've never really smoked and restarted my old cycle of addiction.

Have any of you guys experienced this long afterwards or otherwise?

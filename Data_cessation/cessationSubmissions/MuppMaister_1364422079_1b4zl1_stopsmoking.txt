I hate it.

I hate qutting. It's been 4 weeks and 3 days. I'm feeling really really sad all the time, ten times worse than when I smoked. I love smoking, I don't care what anyone says about that. I had hopes for this subreddit, but I'm just sitting here getting pissed off att everyone saying it's "easy" and that they're "feeling fine". I don't have a support person because I'd just get pissed off at them aswell. I'm sorry, I just have to vent.

After three weeks, cravings appear to be less intense

I'm not feeling them physically as much as I am mentally. I've even managed to cut nicotine out entirely save for the mints that I take with me drinking as a buffer in case I end up in a situation where I really get the urge to light up and need a little curb to prevent me from doing so. The mints aren't an exact substitute, though. They help lessen the intensity of physical cravings that are intensified whenever I'm out with any of my smoker friends.

Some of the positives, well my breathing is starting to come back, though I did experience a shortness of it recently, probably my body coming back to life. I don't do things or create excuses to light up and most importantly, I've got a date with a pretty girl next week. I think 22 days ago, I made the right descision.

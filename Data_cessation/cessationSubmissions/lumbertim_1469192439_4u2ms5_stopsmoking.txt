I want to quit smoking again, need advice

Hi everyone! For the last couple of years, I've been wanting to quit smoking. It's almost a year ago since I last visited this sub. In the meanwhile, I have had two semi succesful quits, each lasting about three months. 

Now I'm back on the smoking wagon once again, and I can't help feeling really demoralized. I felt much better when I didn't smoke. Had better smell, better endurance, whiter teeth, more money, you name it. Now, since taking up smoking again, it feels really daunting to quit again. I've tossed away all my packs before they were empty for the last twenty days or so, but the moment I wake up, I find myself bereft of all motivation to quit. 

My last first succesful quit was using Zyban (I really recommend it!) and the last was cold turkey. How do you guys think I should go about quitting this time. I've read Allen Carr (twice) before, but back then, it didn't really help me all that much. 

Congrats to all long time quitters, and newly quit people. I hope you are all doing better than myself!

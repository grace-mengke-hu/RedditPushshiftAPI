Dying to live

So I'm finally done...


I've realised that this addiction no longer means anything to me and holds no place in my life. Tobacco is a strange substance, and smoking it takes a hold of us in strange ways, but after several unsuccessful attempts at stopping using it I feel as though now is the first time I've truly understood what little it actually means to me.


Life is something that I still think I need to understand a little better to be able to understand to enjoy it - but what better way to start than stopping something that is making me truly miserable.


I can't smoke anymore. I have stopped already and I hope I enjoy removing it from my life as much as I thought I enjoyed making it a part of my life. I've already started my journey and I feel as though I've already made it farther than I've ever managed before.


I find this quote extremely an extremely sobering realisation of what I'm feeling right now - "You can hold back from the suffering of the world. You have free permission to do so, and it is in accordance with your nature. But perhaps this very holding back is the one suffering you could have avoided" - Franz Kafka

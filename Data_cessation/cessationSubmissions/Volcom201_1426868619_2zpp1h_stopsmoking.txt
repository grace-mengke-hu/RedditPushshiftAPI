6 months down.

So far I can run a couple miles without dying. I've pretty much replaced the smoking with my addiction of the gym. I feel like a champ. I’ve wrestled with alligators,I’ve tussled with a whale.I done handcuffed lightning.And throw thunder in jail. But for real, I owe a lot to this sub, cause I always keep coming back to keep myself in check. I love hearing all your success stories and all of the support.

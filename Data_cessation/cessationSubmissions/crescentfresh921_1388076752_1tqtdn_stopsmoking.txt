Reason #1094 - Less Severe Hangovers

One thing I noticed after being 20 days quit is the decrease in severity of hangovers after a night of drinking. Depending on how much you drink - they can still be brutal, but in my experiences they are 2x-3x less severe. I no longer wake up with a throbbing headache, mouth as dry as the desert and severely clogged sinuses. On top of that it doesn't taste like I made out a raccoon last night. I still wake up tired, a little nauseous depending on what I drank, but I can breathe, I don't reek of smoke and my mouth doesn't taste like horse shit. 


Most people recommend not drinking the first month or so due to alcohol being a huge trigger. It is very hard, especially when most of your friends smoke. In my case however, I work long hours all week and the only time I get to see my friends is the weekend, so I sucked it up and went out every night I normally would. Every night was painful, but every night was easier than the last. A major part of my success so far was to get rid of the drinking trigger early. I still really crave cigarettes every time I see them, but now the cravings are usually nonexistent when they are out of sight.


I am in my early 20's and still very much involved in the nightlife. I smoked all through college and pretty much my entire "drinking career." If I can be able to fight the alcohol triggers and become completely content with a beer without a cigarette, then so can you. You will especially thank yourself the next morning.

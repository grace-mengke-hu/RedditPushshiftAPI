Allen Carr's Easy Way didn't work

I got the whole thing about smoking not giving me anything, and I'm okay with never smoking an actual cigarette again. But I tried three times and the nicotine craving always got me back. It just feels too empty, like I turn into a vegetable without it. Did NRT work for anyone here who was resistant to Easy Way in terms of nicotine addiction?

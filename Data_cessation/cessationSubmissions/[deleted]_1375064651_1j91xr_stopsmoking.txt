Hangover was the helper!

After smoking off and on for years, and 10-20 a day for the past year, I have been trying to quit the last few weeks as I have a very long flight coming up. Also the anxiety over my health and guilt over how much money I was spending on smokes when I can barely afford preschool for my son, I know it is time. I drank quite a bit with some friends last night and ended up smoking an entire pack. Woke up this morning feeling like shit, put a patch on and made it the whole day without a smoke. Still don't feel like one! I feel like the hangover really, really helped. Even feeling tired today, I have had so much energy and achieved so much. And I feel proud that I made it a whole day, which will motivate me tomorrow to keep going. This time I am free forever from nicotine, I can just feel it :)

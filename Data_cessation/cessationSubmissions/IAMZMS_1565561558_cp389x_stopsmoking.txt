Anxious and wowww am I craving

So, as the title suggests, I am feeling aaannnxious!! :/ I’m on day 2 and I really really would like a cigarette. I know that it’ll only help in the moment and overall will worsen my anxiety. I’m just having a hard time convincing myself that it matters/that I can do this. Any tips for when a craving hits? (Particularly when accompanied by anxiety) 

Thanks!

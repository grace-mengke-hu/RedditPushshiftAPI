I’m refusing to let my “college smoking habit” follow me into the next stage of my life. A big part of this is letting go of the notion that cigs make me a more interesting person.

Cigarettes don’t make me an artist or a creative. They don’t make me alternative. They don’t make me Don Draper or Holly Golightly. 

They DO make me smell bad, feel guilty, and zap me of my youth. Not to mention they’re slowly killing me.

If I want to be cool, I should live a life that I enjoy and think is cool. If I want to be a creative, I should focus energies on creative projects and collaborations. Smoking is not required.

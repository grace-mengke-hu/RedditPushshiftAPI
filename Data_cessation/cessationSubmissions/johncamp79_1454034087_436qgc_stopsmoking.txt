25 days cigarette free!

This will my third, and final time, quitting smoking.  

I started smoking when I was 13, but didn't develop a full habit until I was old enough to buy my own cigarettes.  I smoked a pack a day from about 18-24, when I finally quit.

I stayed quit for 7 years.  SEVEN YEARS!  Then one little trigger got me started again about 5 years ago, and I was eventually back to nearly half a pack a day.  I kick myself in the ass all the time that I threw away 7 years of being cigarette free. But hey, we all make mistakes, right?

About 2 years ago, I was in a relationship with a woman who wouldn't tolerate me smoking.  We had already been together for quite a while before I finally quit.  I stayed quit for about 6 months before our relationship ended, and then I was back to half a pack a day.

Now here I am again, 2 years later, quitting smoking again.  This time, it's for good.  I feel good about it this time!

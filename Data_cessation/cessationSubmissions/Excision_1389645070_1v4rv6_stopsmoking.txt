Somewhat around 6 months ago I quit.

I don't check my quitting app multiple times in a day. 
I have lost 10 pounds from eating healthier and working out regularly.
I feel/breathe 100x better.
My desire to smoke a cigarette is pretty much gone. 
I still have the thought enter my head sometimes, usually when drunk, but I automatically realize that it's a disgusting expensive habit that would be ridiculous to start again.   If you are still struggling, just know that it's worth the fight.  Eventually you will get there. 

Edit: Woah, 7 months ago.  haha sorry I didn't quit smoking trees.

Weirdness.

Usually at this point in the day I would have smoked 4 or 5 times... but I haven't even had the crazy craving feeling yet today. Like in my head I know I should be, so it's almost like thinking about it is the extent of the craving. I really think that changing the way I feel about cravings is working... fucking love it.

Oh man has this been a crazy ride so far, but I can actually see the light now.

I was a 10 a day for 8 years, went cold turkey on a complete whim (just felt like it was time). I'm not the sort of person that does things in moderation, its either quit or dont. I knew it wouldn't be easy but the range of physical symptoms were crazy.

Cravings have been the easiest symptom to deal with for me. They were intense for the first 2 weeks, but now they are mild and fleeting, it's no longer a struggle not to ask for a pack when filling up the car.

Itchiness from improved circulation was horrible, felt like I had ants on me. That went away after 3 weeks or so.

Anxiety went through the damn roof. I'm not an anxious guy but I found myself crying from fear every time I had a little pain, thinking I had some scary disease or something. Seriously wierd and not like me whatsoever. Also had major tingling and pains in my arms that have only just started to die down. This is a product of the anxiety. This was the hardest thing to deal with, as I didn't know if it was the nicotine or not. Its scary what your mind can convince yourself of, just to trick you into smoking again.

But now I feel pretty great. I've saved Â£200ish, feel tons better in terms of fitness already, I sleep for longer, have more energy in the morning, it's great. The only times I really crave is when I smell someone lighting one up, and it smells amazing but it doesnt make me crazy like it did a few weeks ago. It's more like smelling really good food and getting envious. But apart from that, I'm all good now. This quit is going to stick.

The message I want to leave is dont let your nicotine brain win. It will do ANYTHING to try and get you to smoke. Stuff you cant even imagine. Its all a trick. But if you can do a few weeks nicotine free, you will start winning the fight. It's a downhill battle from this point on.

Good luck guys.

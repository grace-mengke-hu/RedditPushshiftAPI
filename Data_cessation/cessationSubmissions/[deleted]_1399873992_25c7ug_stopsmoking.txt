Well, it's stopping day.

I just smoked my last cigarette tonight. Today's my birthday and so I decided that my gift to myself would be to quit smoking. Had my last drag 2hrs ago at 11:59. The good thing is, none of my friends smoke or know that I do. I smoked quite heavily and I'm just tired of it all.

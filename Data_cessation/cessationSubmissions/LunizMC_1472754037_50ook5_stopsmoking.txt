Almost six and today has been harder than the others

Not even sure why. For some reason, today I seem to have had an excessive amount of cravings. Seems a bit odd. Of course, I'm not going to give in.  Not even sure why I'm posting this. Take my mind of it I guess. I expected this sort of feeling in the first three days, but today has sort of hit me out of the blue.

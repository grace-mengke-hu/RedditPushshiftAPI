Day 5.5 and I feel like death this morning

I'm not sure if it's something special about day 5, but my throat feels very... claustrophobic? Like there's a tight shirt around my neck but I can still breathe. 

I'm happy I've made it this far, the last time I quit was for 30 days a year ago and I wasn't able to keep it up... this time I'll beat my record.

Day 5 might be the hardest one yet, I guess I'll find out.

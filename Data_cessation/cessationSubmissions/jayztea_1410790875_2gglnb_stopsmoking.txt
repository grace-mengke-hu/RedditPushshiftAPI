Found an unsmoked cigarette in the back seat of my car...

and I broke it in half.  I'm feeling pretty good about not smoking and I don't see myself doing it again.

The only thing is I'm starting to feel a little depressed, I have had some issues with anxiety and depression in the past and have worked through them successfully.  So I'm not worried I'm going to fall into a bad place again. 

Has anyone else felt depressed while quitting?

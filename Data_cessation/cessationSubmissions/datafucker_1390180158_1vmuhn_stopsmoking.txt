Doing acid let me quit.

So I was smoking for 2 years and I just did acid about 2 weeks ago and i havent had the need to smoke.  Ive tried to quit before and I just couldnt do it.  So I did acid with some friends and after I havent had any withdrawal symptoms or anything.  Its been 2 weeks and strong.

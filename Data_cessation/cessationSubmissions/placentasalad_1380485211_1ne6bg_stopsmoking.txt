Day 1 #2

A couple weeks ago I wanted to be done forever. I remember the first time I quit for a month and how much better I felt. I want that freedom again. Last time I tried I just got so angry at everything and couldn't even last a day. But I'm gonna keep trying. Cause I can't keep living like this. I hope I see you all tomorrow for day 2.

2 weeks into Chantix

Hi everyone- I’m 2 weeks into Chantix and now I’m feeling queasy in the morning and I get headaches - I’m wondering if these are low level withdrawals? I haven’t smoked in 2 weeks either and I’ve convinced myself this temporary feeling is better than lighting up. Anyone else have this with these meds?

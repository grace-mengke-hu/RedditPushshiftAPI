I have not smoked Tobacco since the 30th of September 2016

I made it the entire month of October wit out smoking a cigarette. I want out drinking several times for my birthday and other occasions and didn't smoke once. I'm proud of myself which feels strange, and I want to say cheers to those here that gave me messages of support during the first few weeks. I'll write back on the 1st of December when I am 2 months smoke free. Keep up the good work lads

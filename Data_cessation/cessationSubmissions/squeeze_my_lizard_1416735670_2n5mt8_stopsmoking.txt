Fuck, I'm a smoker again after more than one year without a cigarette. Feels like shit.

So here it is, I relapsed for good.

I have been a smoker for about 10 years, but last summer (July 2013) I decided I didn't want to be a smoker anymore. I was getting sick of the taste, the smell, of my awful breath, the money I was throwing away and all the shits that comes with cigs. I quit cold turkey and didn't find it too difficult. I really felt I was done for good.

But about a week ago, I felt overwhelmed with a lot a stressful feelings, facing major life decisions and a strong anxiety toward my future. I didn't know how to deal with all that, and my stupid brain decided I just needed ONE cigarette to relax, so I just borrowed a cigarette to a random dude in the street and smoked it. I didn't felt better afterward, but the first thing I did the next day was buying a pack. And now I back on my regular smoking habit.

I smell like shit, I feel like shit, I have trouble sleeping, lost appetite and energy. Fuck I'm feeling real bad. The worst is that I couldn't imagine myself as a non smoker again. Quitting has become a thing I can't even imagine trying again.

Anyway, time to remove my badge. I hope you all will stay strong and not make the mistakes I did. I hope to come back here soon, but for now it's just too hard.

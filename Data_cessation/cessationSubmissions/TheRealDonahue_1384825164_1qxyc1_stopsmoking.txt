No cigarette since 2AM this morning (Pacific Standard Time)

The gum (regular) and e-cigarette are doing the trick so far. Pray for me.

Not sure how this sub feels about e-cigs but I've only taken a couple drags off it today. Really, REALLY helps.

So far, my smelling has... uh, enhanced? And my clothes fucking stink. I quit for a few months last year, and I found cigarette smoke, especially inside cigarette smoke, to be some of the most noxious, repellant shit on the planet.

My first drag after months of no smoking... it tasted like shit. Tasted like the first time I took a drag when I was 14.

I feel like this time I really mean it. I think I'm done for good.

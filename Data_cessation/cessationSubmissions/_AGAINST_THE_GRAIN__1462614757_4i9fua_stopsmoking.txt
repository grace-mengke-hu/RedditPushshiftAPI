Well, I quit nicotine. (And so can you!)

Around two years ago, I smoked my last Camel Menthol cigarette and traded one habit for a seemingly 'safer' alternative; I decided to become a full-time vaper. I was having health problems at the time, and getting into e-cigs was all the rage. I acquired a tank, two batteries, and carried it in my shirt pocket everywhere I went. I literally **slept** with it by my side, too. Just in case I were to wake up in the middle of the night and need a hit of nicotine, presumably. 

It never really occurred to me that one day I'd be forced into quitting this 'safer' habit as well, but it should have been glaringly obvious; the health problems that I've dealt with my entire life have always responded poorly to any kind of stimulant, not to mention the **sugar-laced**, **high nicotine** e-juice that I had become exclusively loyal to. Needless to say, **it happened**; I was becoming just as plagued with symptoms as I had been when I was an 'analog' smoker. 

**The greatest part about quitting nicotine**, for me, is the realization that the withdrawal symptoms aren't half as bad as the symptoms of being an *addict*. If you have a strong enough reason to kick the habit, or if nicotine is *ruining your life* like it was for me, the withdrawal symptoms are **extremely easy** to override. Staying addicted is like standing in a jail cell even though the door is open.

I don't know where I'm going with this exactly, but I think the trick lies within our perception. If you expect the quitting to be positive and transformative, I think it has some kind of impact.

Thanks for reading and I love you all.

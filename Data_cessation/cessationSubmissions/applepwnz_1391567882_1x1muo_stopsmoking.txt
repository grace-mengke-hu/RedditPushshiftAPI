Does anyone else find this easy?

So a little back story, as of 5 days ago I had no particular desire to quit smoking, then I saw a mention of the Allen Carr book on a different subreddit, so I decided to check it out just to see what the commotion was about. I ended up reading through the whole thing in an afternoon and smoking my last cigarette that afternoon. The odd thing is how easy I'm finding this so far. I mean really, the worst craving feels similar to really wanting a snack at night, so it's pretty easy to ignore. What I'm wondering is if it gets tougher at any point after a week? I was always under the impressing that cravings go down more and more as time goes by (I've noticed it a bit already, this afternoon I was playing games and I realized that I went probably three hours without thinking about smoking whatsoever.) I'm concerned though when I read about people who slip up after months. 

Edit: I forgot (I do seem to forget things constantly lately!) today my father returned from a trip to Brazil, so he had brought me a couple of packs of cigarettes from there, it felt great to tell him that I had no use for those.

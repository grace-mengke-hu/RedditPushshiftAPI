18 days before another slip

My struggle with quitting smoking started in around mid August. Of course with the help Nicotine patch. Just around the time I crossed 10 days, I had to experience my father's passing away due to one of most stupidest reason (as per me). He fell of a standing moped while getting off, had a brain haemorrhage and passed into a coma before I was back from work. Had to take the decision to stop the artificial life support, as per the legal norms on my own. •30-08-2017• Was back to smoking a few cigarettes in this duration from my usual pack of 20.
If this was not enough, had to rush a few 100 miles away to cater to my aunt whose organs started to fail. End diagnosis, liver cancer. Luckily I didn't have to decide whether she lived or not as she passed away while she was on ventilator. All this in a span on 10 days from my dad's falls. •07-09-2017•
Came back to my routine and decided that I needed to start once again the process of quitting.
Didn't smoke for the last 18 days in spite of the fact that my wife still smokes. But ended up breaking the chain today with 2 cigarettes.

But I will start once again today. Have to quit this and I will achieve the goal.

Reason  for sharing? 

So that folks who lapse in between, stick to the plan of quitting on the longer run. A few slips are acceptable if you can get back to a 'No smoking', after your lapse

Feel free to reach out, so that I can convince you not to reach out to the cancer stick. We can do this together.

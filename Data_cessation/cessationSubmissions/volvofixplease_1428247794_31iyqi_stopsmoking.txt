I smoked ten cigarettes in a row exactly 28 days ago when my gf broke up with me,i was a non smoker from the first day i quit exactly 107 days ago from now and i stayed the same even after i relapsed even though nobody believed me,not in the real world and not here after i chain smoked half a pack...
What I want to say is that once you truly eliminate the brainwashing i.e. see not smoking as giving something up you will truly be free.I`m not advocating casual smoking but im just trying to prove a point,i was stupid and acted in a impulse,it was only then when i realized that the cigarettes TRULLY didnt do anything to help the situation and that they were a burden rather than a crutch.To summarize,for some people it is essential to fail to truly realize the one and only truth:I never enjoyed smoking and no smoker ever enjoyed poisoning themselves-the only thing we did enjoy was relieving the withdrawal symptoms the first and each subsequent cigarette created.Maybe that is the reason most people quit after +3 attempts?

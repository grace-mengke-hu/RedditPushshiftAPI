Surgery & smoking

Among my reasons to quit was a torn rotator cuff needing surgical repair. The surgeon I chose would not accept smokers as patients due to the tendons having poor blood supply and smoking causes the tiny vessels to constrict, causing poor outcomes and failure to reattach to the bone.

Had successful surgery yesterday. Sorry so brief, I am henpecking with non-dominant hand.

Quitting with a SO that smokes

Hey everyone,

As I have heard and understand, a good support system is ideal when quitting. I am using Champix/Chantix and it is extremely effective. I have been taking it for 3 days and have already gone off smoking and went from 18 cigs a day to just half of one before I throw it away. My girlfriend isn't interested in quitting. All my friends smoke and I know them and bonded with them over smoking. 

However, I live with my girlfriend and she smokes frequently and doesn't fully support me quitting. She will smoke in the car and always ask me to keep them in my pocket. Sometimes it is an example of why not to smoke because I already hate the smell, but there are some times I miss smoking with her. I asked her to stop smoking in the car or next to me but just forgets about it.

Thank you for any help.

Fellow redditor referred me here, today is day one of being a non-smoker!

So I was referred here by /u/Shrinks99 and today's my first day as a non-smoker. I had my first cigarette at a music festival and since then have been smoking a pack a week for a year or so. I'm only 20 but I realise this is a horrible habit with no positive except a short lived buzz. I've tried quitting countless times "after this packet im done" "I'll have one smoke with my friends" etc etc. Hopefully with the support of you guys I'll kick it for good :)

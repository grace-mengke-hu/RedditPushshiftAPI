Thinking of quitting. What brand has the least amount of chemicals? (I'm from Canada)

So, I've been smoking occasionally (maybe 1 cigarette a week) for about 2 years, and in the last year it's been about 1 a day. In the last few months it's been about 2 cigarettes a day.

I really like smoking with a drink, or with friends during a class break, but I don't want to further this habit to the point of no return. After reading a post on here, I thought I'd start by getting a brand with lesser chemicals. I smoke Belmonts. I want to start lessening the amount I smoke, and get back to the days when I only smoked when I went out drinking. I don't want it to be a daily routine. 

Any help or advice would be appreciated.

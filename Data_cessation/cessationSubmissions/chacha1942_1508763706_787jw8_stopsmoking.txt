Day 8 - discipline equals freedom

I have been an athlete my entire life..the irony of writing that on a stop smoking forum is rich..but I state it because I respond well to the blunt, honest, and hard truths that usually come along with participating in contact sports.

I discovered Jocko Willink from the Tim Ferriss podcast. I read his first book, Extreme Ownership and have listened to quite a few of his own podcast episodes.

Today he released a new book.

[Discipline Equals Freedom - Field Manual](https://www.amazon.com/Discipline-Equals-Freedom-Field-Manual/dp/1250156947)

This book offers some hard truths that I respond well to. It's a good reminder that discipline comes from self. I am, and only I, am in control of my reality. 

And today, I choose health, not cigarettes.  I hope you will join me.

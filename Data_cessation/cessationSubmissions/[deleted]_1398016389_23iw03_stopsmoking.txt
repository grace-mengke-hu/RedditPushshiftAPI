I need to quit smoking. Need the support. Cigarettes have destroyed my family.

I'm 20 years old, have been smoking for 3 years and have recently gotten to the point where I can quit smoking. I need all the support and advice I can get! What can I do to quit this disgusting habit? It doesn't feel, smell or taste good anymore. The addiction is there and I'm ready to kick it. 

Thanks for reading.

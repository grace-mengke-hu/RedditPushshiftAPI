Suggestions on use of gum?

So I have been stepping down my cigarette smoking for a bit now and have a pretty good handle on it.  I can go the whole day of work pretty much without a thought of a cigarette.  But the minute I get off of work I immediately want one.  I can go one or two days without one but I get a huge heavy head feeling.  So I'm thinking about gum and have a small pack to help me get through about three weeks.  It says though to chew way more often than I even smoke now.  So im looking for personal experience for what people did when they were basically ending the use of gum.

80 days and sudden cravings

So I just got huge cravings even though the last 30-40 days have been pretty smooth sailing with almost no cravings at all. Almost as bad as week one cravings. However it's pretty easy to dismiss it since I've felt so great past 80 days. My body and mind feel so much cleaner without the nicotine addiction constantly nagging on the back of my mind. My energy levels have also gone up by a lot! 

Remember guys that the pain of cravings is much more tolerable than the pain of giving in. It sounds like some cliche motivational poster but it's true.

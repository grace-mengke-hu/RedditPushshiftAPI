Quit smoking 6 months ago, but started chewing instead...hygienist is not happy.

...and now the dentist is telling me I have per-cancerous sores forming in my lip from dipping. He did say he wasn't all that worried about it, and to move the chew around, but I should really quit for 2 weeks so they can tell if the sores get better or not.

I knew chew was just a bandaid for the real issue of quitting nicotine, but I tried e-cigs and it never got me to quit smoking fully. So I figured (and my doctor agreed) chewing is not as bad as smoking.

But now that 6 months have gone by I really need to kick the nic altogether.

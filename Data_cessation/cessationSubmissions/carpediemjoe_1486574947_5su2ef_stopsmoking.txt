The Toughest Question to Ask Your SO

Last year I asked my wife (we had only been married for a month or two) "What are my two biggest flaws that you would like to see me fix?" Takes lots of guts to ask that. She said 1) my smoking cigs 2) drinking too much.

A year later and now I quit smoking 101 days ago and I switched to a glass of wine at night instead of a 4 shot glass of whisky.

So I asked my wife again last night what my two biggest flaws she wants me to change and she said she would have to think about it. That made me feel really good.

Also this will be my first Lent in 10 years that quitting smoking isn't the thing I "give up." But I never actually gave it up during Lent... rather I smoked every day and just felt super guilty and sad that I was so addicted.

Is the general graph of withdrawals after quitting known? I'm on day 7

I quit cold turkey after smoking for 3 years, and a pack a day for last 3 months of this time. Now on day 7, i feel kinda distracted by the urge as I left home and visited my relatives on day 3 to keep myself involved emotionally. But I'm starting to have a mild headache, dry eyes, and too sleepy by the evening. 

Is it gonna get worse? Is there a known graph that might help me to plan my stay here?

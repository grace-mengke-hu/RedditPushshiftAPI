New guy here. Hello /r/stopsmoking, let's get busy!

I'm here on the basis of (you guessed it) stopping smoking..


Quick backstory, I quit 2 years ago. 
Started a new job and lo and behold *everyone I work with smokes*. I'm 23 with kids, a new house on the way and a car to be buying, I can't afford to start again, forget the health-hazard, this is draining! I'm slim, 6 fat and pretty pro-active, I exercise and eat well yet the forever 18 year old inside me just won't stop. I'm not rock 'n' roll, yet I can't help sparking up or turning down a smoke when offered. I'm craving, I spark up during overtime, I just hate it. 

Help? Nice to meet you all, let's get acquainted. Cheers.

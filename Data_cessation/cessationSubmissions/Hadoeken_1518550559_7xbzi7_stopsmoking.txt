8 days quitting smoking progress

I noticed that on the first 2-4 says that my skin got a bit better and reaching dat 6 or so my skin is getting worse. 
Is it normal and if so does it go away and get better again? (I heard detoxing could lead to worse skin for awhile, but some ppl never got better)

Also it's very easy to stay away from cigarettes, I do have some cravings in my stomach like I'm hungry, but then I just eat a snack and it's gone in 5 seconds or so.

Any info is helpful, thank you.


Edit: Also noticed my hairline improving, hair feels incredibely thick and smooth (if I run my hand through my hair it feels like I have way more). I check my hair daily during my quitting and I see everything change. It's like my hair moved forward, hiding my scalp more and the 'M' shape pattern in balding is dissapearing. This definately makes me very happy.

Every day:
- 2 Litre water
- 2 fruits
- 1 snack with rich fibres
- I try to eat bread that is available at my home (if there is healthy bread I definately take that for the fibres)
- I walk about 1 hour and 30 minutes
- 30 minute nap when eyes feel tired (once only since I need to be sleepy at bedtime otherwise I might not get 8 hours since it's hard already during withdrawals, but is getting better)
- cerial with milk as breakfast

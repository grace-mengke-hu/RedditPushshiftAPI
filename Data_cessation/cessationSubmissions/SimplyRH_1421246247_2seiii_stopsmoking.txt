Sitting here with my morning cup of coffee, realizing it's been one month without a cigarette.

Holy hell you guys.

I'm bowled over with emotion at the moment. There was a time when I was certain I wouldn't be able to quit, because I didn't believe I could fight my addiction.

"Oh, I'm too stressed out to quit, these cigarettes are what keep me sane."

"Oh, what am I supposed to do on my work breaks now? I can't just sit there."

"Oh no, if I'm out drinking there's *no way* I'm going to be able to *not* smoke. So why bother."

Addiction had my voice of reason for a long time. I've had people ask me what happened, what caused me to give it up, what spurred this along. Honestly... I don't know. I was smoking one morning and a co-worker's wife dropped in to give him his lunch he forgot, and she's a nurse. She looked at me and said, "You better quit that, or else I'll be working on you before too long."

And what did I say? "Oh I know! Haha, these things are horrible for ya. I'll quit one day."

Ya know, typical smoker response. Addiction's voice is powerful. A couple days later, I threw my last pack of Camel's away. I guess the thought of leaving my wife behind in this world too early was sobering. Or the idea of accelerating my decaying body more quickly. 

At one point we've all said, "I just want to live life to thew fullest," while a cigarette dangled from our lips. But that's the point. Cigarettes are an anchor, not a pair of wings. And December 15, 2014 was the day I decided to take back control of my life.

If you're having problems believing in yourself, I hope that one person's story has given you the courage to give it up for good. Thank you to this subreddit and its patrons. Because without you, I would not have been able to do it. Thank you for helping me break the bonds, the least I can do is try to help someone else do it too.

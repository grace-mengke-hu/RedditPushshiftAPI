My 23 year-old friend was recently diagnosed with COPD. I know that it's difficult, but please do whatever you can to quit.

My friend's diagnosis was what scared me into quitting.  I can't allow something like that to plague me at my age.  He was a 2-3 pack/day smoker and began around the age of 15.  He has and continues to deal with a SEVERE opiate addiction, so smoking was something that calmed his nerves between fixes.  When he wasn't using, he had a cigarette in his hand.  He usually didn't wait more than 15 minutes between cigs, so I guess I can understand why he was diagnosed with COPD at such a young age.

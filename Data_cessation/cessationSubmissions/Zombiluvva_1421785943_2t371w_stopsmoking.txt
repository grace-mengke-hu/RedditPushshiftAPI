Really effing fed up

15 days in. I've started going to the gym to give myself something else to focus on so I haven't gained any weight but surely I should be feeling healthier by now? People talk of feeling fresher and smelling better but I've had a constant cold and stuffy head since I quit. I now have a second cold sore which is just beautiful but the mouth ulcers have started to abate. I'm not sleeping properly and generally feel like shit. 

I knew this wouldn't be easy but honestly it's beyond a joke. Now I've no intention of going and buying cigs but I would like to feel better for having quit. Anyone else suffering anything similar?

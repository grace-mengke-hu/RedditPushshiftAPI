3 days down. I'm being forced into it but so far.. so good.

I had oral surgery REDONE 3 days ago. I had a dental implant fail to take for a number of reasons, but among them could have been smoking. This time along with bone grafting they also did a tissue graft and assured me even one cigarette can kill the grafted tissue. So. I'm not smoking. 

Ive had 2 pretty phenomenal anxiety attacks.. in fact two of the worst I've ever had in my life. I'm hermitizing right now (not just because I look like a hillbilly with a missing tooth in the front of my face) if I'm not around others my urge to smoke will be less. So far so good.

My husband still smokes and has no sense of smell so he isn't understanding how the way he smells after a smoke is just killing me. Other than that. I survive. Trying to make it stick this time. Id like to live past 55. Good luck all.

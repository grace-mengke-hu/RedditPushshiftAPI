Hypnosis app works!

I've just stopped smoking with the Surf City iphone hypnosis app. I'd thoroughly recommend it. As soon as I finished listening, I went round the house and chucked out anything to do with smoking... 

I'd really recommend this app. It was a standard hypnosis app - the kind of thing I've used before for motivation and stress - but it works a dream. 

I had stop-smoking hynposis in person about 10 years ago,  which was quite expensive. I stopped smoking until I'd unconsciously calculated that I had spent as much on the hypnosis as I would have spent on cigarettes and then started smoking again almost immediately. 

But this app is just Â£2.49 - so even after a few hours, I'll have saved the money. PLUS my mind won't be trying to play these tricks on me about saving money.

If anyone else is thinking of quitting TODAY, just download this app and you'll be a non-smoking in a matter of hours!

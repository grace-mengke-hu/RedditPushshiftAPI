New superpower after quitting

Happy new year to everyone and good luck for all the  new year quitters!

As a long time heavy ex-smoker (25 a day for 15 years) I quit 3 months ago after the first very trying weeks I realised I could fight such a strong addiction. 
So I started changing other things as well like cutting down drinking, taking up exercise. I even flew to another continent and I had terrible fear of flying before and went everywhere possible by train, bus, car or just didn't go. If I had to fly, I was crying, shaking and being a terrible mess through the whole flight. This time I was surely uncomfortable during take off and turbulence but it was really OK. I can't believe how much quitting changed me. 

It's not only your health that improves. For me it was a whole new world of being in controll. And that's the best thing about quitting.

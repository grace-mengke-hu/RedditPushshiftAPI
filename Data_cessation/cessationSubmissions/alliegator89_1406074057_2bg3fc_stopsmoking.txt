My brain keeps doing this thing

I don't know how to exactly explain it but it is like when you think to yourself "I wonder what time it is?" and then you look at the time but forget to remember the time so 5 seconds later you think "I wonder what time it is?". Repeating until you remember to remember the time.

I keep thinking "oh, I should go smoke real quick before I....."  I don't even really want one, but the thought keeps popping up every five seconds.

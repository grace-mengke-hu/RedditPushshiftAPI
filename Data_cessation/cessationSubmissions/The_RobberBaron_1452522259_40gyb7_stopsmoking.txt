72 Hours

Just hit the 3 day mark. 

Historically, this is when my cravings make me act crazy -- to the point where I'll bum a smoke off of a stranger if I need to.  Of course, then I fall into a funk and never get back on track.

This time is different.  I woke up happy this morning, and I feel focused. Besides, I've got too much to accomplish today to waste time pining away for cigarettes like a crappy ex.

Also, thanks to the person who suggested C25k. Going for a run helped yesterday, and I'm really looking forward to it today. Speaking of which, where are my sneakers? 

Love and light, everyone.

Feel like I'm losing it

Day 24 and my anxiety is worse than it's been any of the days before. Day 22 was bad but today it's worse. I feel weak and tired and just on edge. I tried to go for a walk but felt like I wasn't even in my head and it doesn't help that its 104 degrees outside. I can't break this anxiety cycle for more than a couple days but I know it will go away hopefully sooner rather than later. 

The worst thing is I find myself having very little ability to concentrate. My palms are sweatier than anything and they are never that way. I feel at times like I'm just out of it and snap back in and out. I am never going to smoke again but these side effects are brutal. I just keep reminding myself how bad the feeling of the next craving was but this really sucks right now. I'm at work and all I want to do is just go to sleep because I just feel so weak and tired.

30 Days!

This has been a strange quit. The morning I woke up and decided I was no longer going to smoke - that was it. I just stopped. After 12 years and nearly a pack a day habit I just decided that wasnt who I was anymore. Here I am 30 days later. I made it. I wish all of you on this journey calmness of heart, determination to succeed and the willpower to resist temptations.

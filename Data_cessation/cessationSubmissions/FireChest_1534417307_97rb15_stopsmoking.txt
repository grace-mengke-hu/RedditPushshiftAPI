Anyone else find they're more addicted to the actual ritual of smoking (having the cigarette in your hand and inhaling smoke) more than the actual nicotine itself.

A bit of background, I used to smoke cigarettes and joints and made the choice to quit cigarettes first which I found quite easy to do, however when I made the choice to quit smoking joints because I was getting high too often, I found this incredibly difficult not because I missed getting high (because I was getting sick of being high) but more because I missed the feeling of smoking which made me go back to cigarettes. Eventually I made the switch to vaping nicotine free eliquids but it just doesn't feel the same.

smoked for almost 20 years, tried most NRT's, and Zyban/Chapix. Scared, but trying cold turkey

So, the title says it all, I'm terrified and I don't know why, but I gotta try again.
Here's a run down of past failures:
Gum - tastes awful, didn't do much

Patch- doesn't work properly cuz I have to remove it to sleep, it gives me intense nightmares 

Champix- Seriously messed with my head, made me almost manic/depressive, very moody like a woman on a hormone rollercoaster(i'm male)

Zyban - Messed with my mood, AND gave me night terrors, and vivid uber violent dreams.

Any thoughts? advice?

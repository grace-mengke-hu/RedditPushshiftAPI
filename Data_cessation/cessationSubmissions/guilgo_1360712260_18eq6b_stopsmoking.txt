51 days!

A few months a go i couldn't imagine reaching a milestone such as this one. I imagined myself a smoker at a senior age or something close to that, then again who knows. Now, 51 days went by and the world seems darker and brighter at the same time, sometimes, but i keep on going, just the feeling of regaining control, reclaiming my body, something that, after 9 years of smoking i couldn't even picture anymore, its more than i could have imagined. Being a smoker was normal, not anymore.
 To the 100th day!

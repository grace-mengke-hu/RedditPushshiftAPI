One smoke left in the pack and I'm not buying anymore.

I have smoked for more years of my life than not.  Usually about a pack a day and I constantly stress over having enough to get through.   My so and i are both quitting.  Any advice on how to do this together and tips to maintain composure would be appreciated.

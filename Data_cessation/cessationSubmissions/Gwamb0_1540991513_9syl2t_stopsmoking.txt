Need advice, please

I want to stop. I really do. I mainly vape now, dropped tobacco products almost completely. 

However I'm kinda scared. Each time I tried to stop, after 2 days I felt like I was drunk the whole time. Nauseated. I don't know.

I have much things to do at the moment and I can't afford to waste even one day.

Could you tell me your experiences? Don't want to hear "it was easy, just do it", because I know it won't be easy for me.

What can I expect, what are best ways to deal with every possible side effect?

I could read about it, but I want someone to tell me honestly what kind of hell should I prepare for and what's the best way to deal with it.

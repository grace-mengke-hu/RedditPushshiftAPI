Got my new badge (Day 1)

I'll keep it brief, because the story is similar to so many - smoked for a long time, quit for almost a year, went back (why? lots of excuses but I guess the real answer is "I wanted to")...and now I'm back on Day 1. 

The plan: don't smoke, participate in this online community, start doing yoga again, maybe start meditating again (torn on that one)...and don't smoke. 

Thanks for reading.

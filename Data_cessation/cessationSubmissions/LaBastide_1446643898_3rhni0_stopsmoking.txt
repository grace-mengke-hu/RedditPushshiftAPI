I did follow through ...

I feel like I've deceived myself.

During a long stay in Thailand, I managed to convince myself to stop smoking after a two day trip in Singapore. Singapore was so hot, that I didn't feel any will to smoke. It would just be painful and pointless.

Once I came back from Singapore, I decided to stop cold turkey. And it worked ... for a month.

I work in the Hospitality environment, and smoking is part of the job, somehow. Seeing people smoke every day made me crack... So I smoked one drag. And that was it.

Yet, stupid me, I was invited at a party, and why ... don't ask me, I bought a pack of cigarette. Smoking has become such a bad habit that I could smoke one pack per night. And that was it.

I'm back in the smoking rail for 2 months now.

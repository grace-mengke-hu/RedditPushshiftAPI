Just started this and other cleaning programs within my life. I need help managing the huge scope of my transformation!

I have more or less 1 week of no fapping and it's going gorgeus. Also no more playing games (DoTA2 was my poison) for hours upon hours since that crucial point in my life.

I had seen the destruction I would do upon myself and decided I must stop it. I have seen how this vicious circle of addictions has been slowly eating my creative soul by choking it with distractions and lack of productivity.

With every day I start to be more energetic. More emphatic with me and what I really am, thus more emphatic with the people around me and their feelings.

In the light of those epyphanies I have today signed up for a no smoking badge...but having second thoughts, I feel I can't do this at the same time.. ???

Why do I feel that I have to trade one for another? 

Is there anyone who managed to quit smoking also while qutiting several other things?

I have the urge to fill the gap left by games and pornographic material by smoking.

FWIW I never smoked too much... only rolled tobbaco (can't ever smoke cigarrettes) and just a few per day 3-5 (worse days were like 10). I have regular week/week and a half long pauses with not a single cigarettes every 2 weeks, but am feeling more and more that I would definitely relapse after the pause, and afraid of going full smoker all the time.

I am a smoker no selfdeceit there but really can't get the determination to stop this bad habit also... :(

It's been a great week so far with less of those soul consuming actions but I feel like pushing it when trying to get rid of smoking at the same time also.

I truly need some insight before I search for rolling papers (I already limited my access).....

Coughing Like Hell

9 days out. Smoked on and off for 7 years and planned a quit and have started reading Allen Carr. 

Started out coughing up banana colored phlegm, over the past week it's just clear mucus now coming up.

Wondering how long to expect this to go on. Lots of cough drops and boiled ginger root getting me through this.

Today I hit my 1000th cigarette not smoked! It feels surreal and now I'm trying to find an image of what that looks like.

I find it hard to wrap my head around the amount, so much I started searching for images of what 1000 cigarettes looks like - e.g. a picture of 1000 buds in a gigantic ashtray, or anyway preferably 'loose' /not in packages etc.. However my image searches didn't return much. Could you help? Thanks.

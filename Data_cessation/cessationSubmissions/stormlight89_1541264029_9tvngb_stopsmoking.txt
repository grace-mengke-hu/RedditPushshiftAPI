Implementation Intentions that Really Work

So I have just stumbled onto implementation intentions, and it's clear if I had clear plans to do when I'm under pressure at work or fighting with my girl or whatever, I would not have had so many relapses.   


Please share your best implementation intentions (pre-plans to do in each situation) along with the specific situations here.  


I'm specifically interested in what your plans are when you're having an argument with your SO, a really bad day at work, or dealing with unpleasant family. Thank you all.  


PS: It's day 1 of quitting after many a day of trying and failing, and I'm not gonna fail tonight. I have this feeling that I have it covered today.

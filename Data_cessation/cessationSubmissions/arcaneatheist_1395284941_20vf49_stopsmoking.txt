The Rule of Threes...Self fullfilling prophecy

I hadn't thought about how long it had been since I put my last one down in probably a year. I'm a committed non-smoker, no question. About a month ago or so, I smoked one on a crazy night out with some friends. Then started having "smoking" dreams again. I realized, hey, I'm at three years. Three days, three months, three years. Those were the three hardest times for me. I got through each one though. That one cigarette I smoked a couple of weeks ago solidified my distain for tobacco and the tobacco industry. For those of you at three days or three months, I wish I could impart to you how much BETTER my life is without the cigarette monster. All the little things, like how much better I can taste now and not constantly having to worry about when I can sneak away for my next drag, make everyday a better day, I promise.

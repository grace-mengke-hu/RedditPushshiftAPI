Almost at 2 weeks. I think the reason it feels "real" this time is because I see every unsmoked cigarette as a gain, not a loss.

Not sure if this thinking makes sense for anyone else, but every other time I've tried to quit, the act of not smoking felt like a sacrifice. Even if I could see cigarettes for the life-ruiner they are, rationally speaking, the animal pleasure of smoking was still an unqualified good, and thus not smoking was an act of sustained self-denial. And that can only hold out for so long.

This time around, I realize that every hour I go without smoking is a gain in itself. I become less dependent, save more money, learn how to spend my time thoughtfully instead of killing time in the 45-minute hollows between cigarettes. 

And I don't mean that I visualize un-smoked cigarettes going towards some arbitrary tally, earning achievements on QuitNow and the like, because I think that sort of gamification is too impersonal to do more than encourage you; it's not your motivation. The real gain is that I'm no longer dependent, I'm in control, and the further I move from that last cigarette, the more powerful I become.

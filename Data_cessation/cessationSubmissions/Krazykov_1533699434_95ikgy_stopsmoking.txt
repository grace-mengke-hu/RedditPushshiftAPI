Longest streak so far, almost 4 months!

First time here, hope you all doing well with trying to quit.

I been smoking since 2006, probably about 3 to 4 packs a week and sometimes a pack day during some more troubled times. I tried to quit many times and the longest I ever managed to go was about a month or so then would relapse every time. Recently I been to South Korea in April this year where a pack of smokes cost about $2 compared to $30 where I'm from. So I went a bit nutz and smoked even more then I normally do hahaha, but since coming back home I still haven't had a single one, feeling great but I have to say the urges are still there unfortunately :( Wish me luck :)

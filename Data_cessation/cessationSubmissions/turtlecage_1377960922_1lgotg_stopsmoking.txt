Last night I was surrounded by smokers

I was hanging out with a really good friend of mine who smokes. I told him I quit and he was proud of me, maybe even jealous. 

Him and I would always smoke together, often sharing cigarettes to make our packs last longer. Now that we don't have that ritual I thought I'd miss it, but I don't. 

At his house last night, he invited several people and it became a sort-of party. I had a few drinks so I my judgment was already slightly impaired. 

When everyone started lighting up, I had my first *strong* craving of these entire 6 days. Before that I had mere thoughts that went away in seconds. This time it was intense. 

But I just kept telling myself, "How will you feel tomorrow, knowing you set yourself back to day 1, and ruined all your progress?" 
That kept me from smoking. 

Later on, when all my friends were coughing and smelled terrible, I was so happy I didn't take a drag. 

I don't want a cigarette, and neither do any of you. Addiction is bullshit.

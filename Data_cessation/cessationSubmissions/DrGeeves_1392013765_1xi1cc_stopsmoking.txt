So close.. I still have some troubles.

Haven't visited this place in a while, thought I would stop by.  Wow, I never thought I would make it one year without smoking.  I'm so close I can taste it.  This is pretty embarrassing to admit, but this is the best thing I've ever done in my life.  (I'm not a parent or anything..)

I don't mean to bum anyone out, but I'm still having some troubles.  For instance when I hang out with my boss after work or other smokers, I have to think to myself the next day if I partook in one of their cigs.  Just the other day I had to do the "smell check" on my clothes and hands.  Whew.

11 Days Tobacco Free... Some Olfactory Realizations...

I smoked for 10 years, and I feel like an X-Man crossed with a bloodhound with my current sense of smell. I knew it would come back, but this is insane.  

They say that smell is the sense linked closest to memory, and since I was 18 when I started smoking, the last week I have felt like Ebenezer Scrooge walking around with The Ghost of Smellings Past.  Cut up some watermelon? BOOM, I'm in 5th grade at camp, free and full of innocent joy like it was yesterday.  Some kid in the mall is wearing ADIDAS cologne(they still sell that shit?!)? BAM!  I can see my pimply-faced high school boyfriend in my mind's eye, clear as day, and I feel sharp pangs of my first heartache.  Open my car window while driving past pine trees?  Well, then the simile comes full circle and it IS Christmases past with anticipation and presents, wonder and excitement... It's been an absolute roller coaster of memories and emotions on top of the ALREADY crazy process of withdrawal.  Thank God for the patch.

The craziest part is when my co-worker (who I always shared smoke breaks with) comes back in to work after a cigarette.  The first few days I wanted to sloppily French kiss her just to suck some of the residual smoke out of her lungs, but now with my new nose?  She smells DISGUSTING.  It's actually difficult for me to still respect her as my colleague as the smell makes her seem so unprofessional to me.  The realization that this is how I smelled for TEN YEARS to the people I love, to the bosses I wanted to impress, and even to random people I passed on the street is all the motivation I need (ya know, other than cancer and death) to never buy another pack. 

Thanks for reading.  Keep fighting the good fight.  Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go buy a dozen roses, bake some cookies and get my sniff on.  :)

Back on the wagon. 14 days strong.

I got really sick with a terrible respiratory infection and I'm hoping this will be the last wakeup call I need to quit. I have been on and off for years and never have been as sick as I was if that was a preview of coming attractions if I keep smoking it was pretty scary. Gotta stay strong.

Happy beyond words.

Having been a smoker for almost 13 years, I am elated to say that for my first time attempting to quit I officially have 26 days under my belt.  I feel as if I had passed some of the worst withdraw symptoms for now, but who knows.  What I do know for certain is that this subreddit played a crucial role in my ability to stay away from the cancer sticks.  So I say thank you to all of you who contribute to anything positive in here, I could not have done it without everyone's supportive words.  Here's to a smoke free life!

I am scared to quit smoking...

I am 26 (m) and have been smoking since I was 15, I promised myself I would quit on my 25th birthday (nope) and will be 27 in three months.  Both my fiance and I are recovering drug addicts, and we have both been sober off drugs for 7 years.  We don't really drink, and we both smoke, it is pretty much our only vice.  She has smoked for longer than I have (17 years) and has been expressing concerns about her health recently (recent chest pain and tingly feelings in her throat/mouth).  She also wants to get pregnant within the next year and she is worried that I will not quit smoking if she does get pregnant although she has made it clear that is expected, which I completely understand.  Although she has been smoking longer than me, I smoke way more often than her and I can see that it causes her stress.  I have routines, 2 in the morning, 2 on the drive to work, one outside work before I go in, 1 two hours after work starts, 5 on my 1 hour lunch break, an additional one two hours after lunch, 1 right at 5 when I walk to my car, followed by 2 more on the drive home etc.  I find comfort in this routine and I am scared shitless of how I will be able to break it.  I have a pretty stressful high paced job and smoking is definitely my coping mechanism.  I have tried to quit before, but not seriously, and haven't been able to go more than a week without.  To me, smoking enhances life, I really really really enjoy sitting with my fiance on our porch and lighting one up and talking about our day etc, and I feel like part of me won't enjoy stuff like this as much without smoking, which sounds absolutely fucking insane.  I don't even know where to begin, I feel like cold turkey is the only way to go because I fear that if I continue to buy cigarettes, but try to smoke less, I will not be able to and will quickly resume my current consumption level.  Anyone have any advice for cold turkey vs. weening themselves down?  HELP

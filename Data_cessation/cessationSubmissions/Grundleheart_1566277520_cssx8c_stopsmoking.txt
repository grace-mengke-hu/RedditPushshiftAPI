Day 1

Bought the patch today. Slapped one on. I had almost no desire to smoke most of the day, a stressful evening led me to one cigarette but it didn't provide the old 'relief' that it used to. 

I can't believe what a difference the patch makes, I've tried quitting cold turkey a few times to no real success. 

I suppose the next real test will be a birthday party this weekend, as alcohol usually increased my smoking. 

Just wanted to say hi! And if you're on the fence about quitting, start today! &lt;3

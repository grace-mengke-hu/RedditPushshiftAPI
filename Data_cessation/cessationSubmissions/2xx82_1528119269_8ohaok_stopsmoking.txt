Easing into it: Been wearing the patch for two days now and smoked five cigarettes (all of them first thing in the morning and after meals) instead of forty. My goal today is to not smoke until after dinner.

Is this a copout or actual progress? My smoker friends say it's the latter, but nonsmokers have told me it's the former.

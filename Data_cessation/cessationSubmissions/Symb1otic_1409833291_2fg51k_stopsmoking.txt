Got my Patrick today :)

Obligatory 1 month post: its been a month i guess. feels nice to have accomplished it. wasn't that bad after the first week though. to everyone thinking about starting: if you want to stop then do it. don't think too much about stuff. just do it and everything will sort out along the way :D

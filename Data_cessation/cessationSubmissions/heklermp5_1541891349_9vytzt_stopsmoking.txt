Extremely tired, help

I'm 20 yo male, smoking for almost 5 years. Everyday at least 20 cigarettes (sometimes 30, like every third day). I drink at least 2 cups of coffee everyday. I drink 1 energy drink every third/fourth day. My diet sucks. I don't eat fruit and I don't take vitamins at all. All I do is pasta and fast food. 
Is this the cause?
Should I really really stop or I can mess up with cigs a little bit more since I'm young?
I have hardcore craving whenever I stop smoking. I can last 2 hours before I turn on my car and buy a pack at 2 am.

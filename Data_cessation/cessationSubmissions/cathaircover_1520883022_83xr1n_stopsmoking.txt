Feeling so frustrated about quitting. Will I ever really be ready? Partial rant.

In the past 3 weeks I’ve bought a vape, read Allen Carr’s book, listened to the audio version of it when I was doing stuff around the house, looked at this subreddit multiple times a day, saved posts and comments I found helpful, read countless articles about addiction, cut back on my main trigger coffee...etc...I’ve even been having vivid dreams about smoking when I still smoke a few a day! I feel like I’m driving myself crazy thinking about quitting. 

Last night I smoked my “last” cigarette, looked at myself in the mirror and said “cathaircover, this is it. It’s over”  

Set my quit date on smoke free and went to bed. Lasted 17 hours and I caved. 

I’ve been smoking for 15 year straight. 

How can I truly get into the mindset of wanting to quit without driving myself crazy? Ugh...I just feel so disappointed in myself. 

I feel like I can’t control myself. Smoking is my only real vice. Never been a big drinker, smoked a lot of weed when I was younger but I barely touch that now. I honestly think I need to be locked in a room for a week to quit.

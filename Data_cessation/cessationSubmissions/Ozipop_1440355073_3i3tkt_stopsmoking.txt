Constant Encouragement

Hacking up brown slimy stuff has been a good motivator to me this last week or so. For almost a decade I've been cramming that tar deep in my body, gross but happy to getting it out. 

Figured out the other day that I took almost 1.5 million puffs before I quit now. That's a lot of breaths of sticky smoke. I know it will be a while before my body recovers totally. Well, almost. Permanent damage has been done I suppose. 

Breathe fresh my co-quitters.

I decided it's time.

I had my last cigarette 5 days ago. This is my first weekend without those nasty bastards. The cravings suck. I'm a logical man so I ask myself this question at each craving: Do I want a cigarette because I'm bored or because I'm addicted? I'm going to say it's 50/50 so far but I won't smoke for either reason. My own arrogance made me quit. (reading reddit threads 1000 deep helps too) 

Thanks for listening, it helps me out immensely to keep my mind occupied.

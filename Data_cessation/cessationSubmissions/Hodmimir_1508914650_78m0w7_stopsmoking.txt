Help quitting for good

The reasons I want to quit are, for the most part, obvious. There's also the fact that I told my fiance I would quit a month ago and never did.

I want to be done with cigs for good, but I have to be honest with you all, I love it. Nothing and nobody will ever convince me that smoking is disgusting. It bothers me that I enjoy it so much, honestly, because I know I shouldn't. I've tried to quit many times before and failed. I vaped for a while but that just turned into another habit instead of a way to quit. Honestly the hardest part for me is the first few days. I just become VERY aggressive and anxious. I don't mean to be but I just am and I hate that about myself. What's your best advice for dealing with withdrawal symptoms? What's your best advice in general?

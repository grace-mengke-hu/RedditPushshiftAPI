In need of some advice

I don't know if this is necessarily the right place to post this, but I can't think of anywhere else that would be appropriate so here goes. I've been dating this guy for a several months now and he's a smoker. He's 23, goes through a pack every day or 2 and has been smoking since his teenage years. He's also addicted to Xanax but has been to rehab and has that completely under control. I love the guy, but I hate cigarettes. Always have, and don't see me changing my mind on that. I've told him many times how much I dislike the fact that he smokes, have encouraged him to quit many times (he's mentioned doing it in passing a couple of times on his own) but he absolutely refuses to budge. His dad is currently undergoing chemo for lung cancer he developed from a smoking habit. I just don't know what to do. I want him to quit so badly but I know that I can't force him. Maybe he'll come around one day but who knows. It just doesn't make any sense to me. I acknowledge that I don't know how it is being addicted to cigarettes but I know it's rough. I'm mostly just feeling particularly upset about the whole thing right now and just needing to vent about it. I just don't get why he seems to have no desire to even try to quit despite everything. I know there are certainly worse vices to have in the grand scheme of things but I just can't really get over this. 

TL;DR- Boyfriend=Heavy smoker & I hate it. What do?

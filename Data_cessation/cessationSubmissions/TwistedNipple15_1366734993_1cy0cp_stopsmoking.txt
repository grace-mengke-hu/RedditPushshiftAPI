"This pack is my last pack! I swear!"

I am so tired of making excuses, it seems like I am always saying this. I have tried cold and end up smoking more often. I have tried cutting back only to find something that "stressed me out too much". I am so tired of smelling and tasting nothing but ashes. I am a single mom of two and have even gone so far as to excuse my smoking to things like: "I don't want to snap at my kids" or "I am too busy to change my routine." (advise I got from a counselor) I feel so helpless and weak! I am at a loss.

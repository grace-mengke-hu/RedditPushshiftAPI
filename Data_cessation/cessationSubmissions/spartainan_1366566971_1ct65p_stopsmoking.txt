day 4, getting easier.

today is day 4, i made myself a deal, buy a motor bike and quit smoking at the same time, well got the motor bike and had 2 smokes after buying it, havent had a single one since, yesterday at work i went to do my regular routine, go hang in the install bay for a couple mins and then sneak out the back door for a smoke. had to stop myself going out there, ive drank 2 of the nights and i still didnt smoke. i even had a full pack beside me, and i have a full pack in my truck. tempting but not going to crack here. looking forward to riding the bike this week.

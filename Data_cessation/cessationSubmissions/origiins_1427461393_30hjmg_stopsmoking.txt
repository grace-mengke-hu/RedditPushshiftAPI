Stopping for the umpteenth time, what can I do to see it through?

I'm 21 years old, been smoking since I was 16 and can be quite stubborn at times when it comes to giving up. However this morning I woke up after smoking about 20 fags, my usual is 10 a day I was coughing up my lungs and my chest was really tight so I've decided enough is enough.

I've started going to the gym more and want to take up more physical activities so stopping would be a huge help. The only thing is I've tried everything and it doesn't work. From going cold turkey, to nicotine patches which I seem to be allergic to. What is my best option to make sure I don't relapse?

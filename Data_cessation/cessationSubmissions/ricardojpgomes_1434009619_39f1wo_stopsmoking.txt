First day nicotine free in 20+ years

Hi

I tried to quit last week (Monday) and it did not work, but I kept my motivation up and decided to give it another go this week (also Monday) and this time it's working. 

I've passed the 72-hour mark and I'm supposedly nicotine free.

It's still soon to say that I've become a non-smoker, but I do know I don't want to go through those 3 days again. So I must be really dumb if I pick up another cigarette ever again.

As for the benefits, only the smell is better for me now, the rest will surely come in time.

If anyone is still considering quitting, go for it. If I can do it after 20+ years and more than a pack a day so can you.


Proud to be smoke-free, even if just for the first 3 days

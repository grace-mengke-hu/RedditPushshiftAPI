I feel so fucking strong now, mentally.

I went drinking with my buddies today, just came home, 2 am here. 
I didn't smoke or touch a cig. Proud of myself because I have proven to myself that not even alcohol can touch me. Not coffee, not mornings, not dinner, not stress. Nothing and no one. 
I made a king midas rule for myself, almost obsessed with it now. 
If there is a cig in my hands, I will break the cig no matter what. 
Haven't gotten one in my hand since I quit, but it reinforces well. 

Edit. Thank you all very much for your kind words

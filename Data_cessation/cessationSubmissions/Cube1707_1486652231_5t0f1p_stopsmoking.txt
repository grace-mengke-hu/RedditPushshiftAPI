Quiting smoking whilst still socially smoking

Just wondering if anyone has had experience with quiting smoking, whilst still smoking when having drinks with friends. Currently 20 and at university, and the parts of the nights I enjoy most when out is having a cigarrette, although I hate smoking daily.

Is it unrealistic to quit smoking whilst still social smoking (every 3-5 weeks), and ensuring that only having 1 to 2 per time?

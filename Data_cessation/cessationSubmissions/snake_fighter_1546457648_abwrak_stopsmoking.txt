How should I deal my marijuana withdrawal?

(It’s my first post here and I’m not native English speaker, please don’t ban me or sth)

Hi,

I smoked a lot of marijuana last 2 years. To be honest I smoked ca. 1.5 kg (3.3 pounds). I’m a heavy smoker, I smoke 4-5 joints every evening. I know it’s too much and I know I shouldn’t do this. Don’t think of me as a pathetic junkie. I’m responsible and kind of clever guy. I run my own company, have wonderful girlfriend and enjoy my life. I also never smoked before finishing my all tasks and things I have to do. I decided to quit smoking mj.

I feel like a piece of shit. I have a strong headache, nausea, didn’t eat whole day (it’s 8:00 pm right now) and I can’t concentrate at anything. I also can’t sleep (last night I slept 2 hours).  I can’t function like that (high stress at work, crucial customer contract negotiation upcoming)

There comes my question for you:

Do you think mini-dosing weed (like one hit before the sleep) would be good for withdrawal survival? 

Just wanted to add: I’m not looking for an excuse for smoking. I have mj at my place and I could do it right now and justify myself. I just wonder if it could be a good idea or should I just be zombie for some time and it will pass.

31 days!

Today is one month for me. (I should get a badge). I'm truly amazed at my strength and diligence to stay away from tobacco products for 31 whole days. I really never thought I could do it, but the problem was I didn't want to do it. With the help of those closest to me, and all the stories and advice on this subreddit, it was a lot easier than I thought. Thanks to all on here for sharing the successes and struggles you've all gone through! 

I am using NRT in the form of an ecig at the lowest dose. When that bottle is out I plan on getting 0 nicotine and weaning off from there. I mostly only use it when I'm out at bars with my friends who smoke. One the best parts of this whole journey is my mothers decision to get an ecig after she saw my success with using one and being able to quit tobacco. She's smoked for 40 years, has early stages of COPD, and I hope she sees it through. I have passed on what I've learned here to her and it's helping her as well. So, THANK YOU, r/stopsmoking for everything you've done for the community of people here on reddit! You guys are the best. :)

There's something missing

I'm walking down the street and I casually become aware of strange gnawing feeling in the back of my head. Some chemicals in my brain are coalescing into a little voice. The voice tells me something is missing, something I forgot to do. It's kind of urgent. What is it? The little voice says something to the concious front brain voice. The cigarettes, you fuckwit. You forgot the cigarettes. You were supposed to acquire the cigarettes, like you have every couple hours for 10 years, and now where the fuck are they? We're not doing that anymore, front brain voice tells the little voice. You're never going to have it again.

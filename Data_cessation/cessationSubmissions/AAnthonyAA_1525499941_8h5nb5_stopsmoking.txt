Made it to one week tonight!!! 20 years as a smoker is enough for sure...

Sitting here trying to think of what to write but my girlfriend is making a fight so I don't know if I'll be able to focus.  Not like it's hard enough just quitting smoking.  We have to fight every weekend like clockwork...  I hope she gets help or finds someone that wants to be treated like garbage.  I am quitting the things that make me feel terrible.  She must be scared...   She left just now, because I want to blog.  She started an argument right before, tried to make up for her insults and abuse by playing it off like nothing happened.  But I don't want to live like a zombie, or a prisoner.  Enough is enough.  The oppressors need to go.

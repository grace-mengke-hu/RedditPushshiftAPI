Need urgent help - Allen Carrs book

I am currently reading Allen Carrs book. I decided to quit smoking about 4 hours ago, and after an hour and a half I found his book, and been reading it ever since. Just by reading it I kind of got past the urges, but I don't know wether or not I should take his advice and not stop smoking until the book tells me to. I don't want to, I am afraid it'll bring me right back to where I was only 5 hours ago, but I am more afraid of ruining the point of his book. Would really appreciate some fast feedback here before I fuck up this obviously glorious book, or my quitting.

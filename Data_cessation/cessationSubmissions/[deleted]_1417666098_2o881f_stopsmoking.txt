I've been a lurker here for a while now...

I've been a lurker here for a while, I'm 16 live in ohio, I'm a sophomore in high school, and I smoke.

The thing is that when I smoke it's not an addictive thing for me. I smoke every day. (I know you guys are going to say that's an addiction) but I promise it's not, you see I only buy a pack when I go to a certain friends house. And when I run out of that pack that's it, until I go over again of course. But that can be weeks at a time with no nicotine and no withdrawal at all. 

That being said, I do notice that it's a good crutch, (I have a lot of self image issues and a lot of self hate; compiling with bulling and stress) to use to calm myself down. But I've never felt the need for a cigarette, I've never wanted one so bad I shake I don't have concentration issues after I stop smoking. Can this be because I'm an under age smoker, does the availability have anything to do with me not being addicted, even though I can get a hold if them easily if I needed to?

And what would be the best way to stop using cigarettes as a stress reliever -I started talking to a girl, and she hates that I smoke. But I use it to cope instead of self-harm. So any ideas, besides therapy or anything involving professional help?


Sorry, this is my first post and there's probably grammatical errors all over it, and thanks for your help.

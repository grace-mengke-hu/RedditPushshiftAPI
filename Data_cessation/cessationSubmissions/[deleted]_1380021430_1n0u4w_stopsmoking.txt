Am I meant to feel better already? Only 24 hours...

I was 20/day smoker, I've quit opiates in the past and comparing to smoking I feel so much clearer already.

I had 1 smoke 24 hours ago, which before that I went 1 day to 'test the waters'. 

My taste/smell is already coming back, my tongue feels like it got it's first water change in years. 

I can think so much more clearly, and I'm SO much less impulsive. My self-esteem has increased, though I'm a bit irritable/pissed at times (not like me at all). 

Perhaps it's placebo, just wonder if others feel really good on the first/second day, still got the cravings but I'm 100% determined so they're nothing to me. That hint of mental clarity is very motivating.

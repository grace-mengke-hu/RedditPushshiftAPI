One month today!

I've been cigarette free for one month as of today.  The first day was incredibly hard, so I decided to go with an e-cigarette.  But I barely use it now, probably two or three times in the last week.  I travel a lot and it is so freeing not having to worry about finding a place to puff after a flight, or even getting irritable on that flight in the first place.  It's so good not having to scan for smoking hotel rooms, or hiding from airbnb hosts down the road to get a few puffs.  So many moments not lost with friends and family while ducking out for a smoke, so much money saved, so much embarrassment avoided at stinking like a chimney around the kids in my life.  

Just want to thank this sub, reading the posts here made me feel better (less alone in the struggle).  To anyone having difficulty just know there will always be an excuse, you just have to do it.  It's hard, and it'll always be with you, but besides the health and money, you gain such a sense of accomplishment and confidence.

I've got the inspiration, but have I got the willpower?

So today I read [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/2xc947/text_soon_i_will_be_gone_forever_but_thats_okay/) inspirational post about a redditor who will soon pass because of cancer, shortly after, I found out about Nimoy's death due to COPD. "This is it" I told myself, went outside to have one last cigarette, twisted up my pack of smokes, threw them out, downloaded Cessation Nation, requested a badge reset, and here we are. I had tried quitting using this subreddit and Alan Carr's method before, but failed. Ever since it's been in the back of my mind to quit but I didn't have the guts to go for it.

Today I start that journey, I know I have what it takes to see it through! For all my fellow quitters... WE CAN DO THIS!

Feeling anxious today

I've been a smoker for over 6 years. I quit 5 days ago. I never really wanted to quit or had a huge motivation to quit, but I've been really disgusted with my appearance and health lately, and remember being more attractive and having higher energy before I smoked. So I finally worked up the courage to stop. But it's hard, obviously. I'm keeping it a secret from everyone in case I fail and relapse; I don't want to disappoint everyone all over again because of course they're all so judgmental that I had even smoked in the first place.

But I can feel myself getting so irritated. It wasn't bothering me so much until today. I get stressed a lot at work or in my personal life (people really, really frustrate me) and I just think about how much I want a cigarette. It's like one giant twitch inside of me. And it's hard because since no one knows, I'm snappy and I'm grumpy and basically have no support. 

I have the Smoke Free app and it's really encouraging, but today is just so bad, so many things are bothering me, and it's taking a lot of willpower to not go buy a pack right now. I'm hoping you guys can give me the support I need right now - hoping I can stay strong but starting to lose it.

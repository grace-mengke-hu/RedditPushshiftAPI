My Worst Smoking Deam, to Date

Update: Holy Hell!  I only just realized I wrote "Deam" instead of "Dream".  Sheesh.  Too bad I can't correct that.  

I'll make this one quick, as I'm about to play Splatoon.  

Anyway, I had a dream that I was at a friend's house, and he offered me cigarettes.  I took two of them, which I smoked back to back.  I then felt ashamed of myself and hated that I'd have to reset my badge.  Even in the dream I scanned my surroundings to make sure I really was awake, and I believed I was.  10 months down the drain, lol.  

And when I woke up this morning, one of my first thoughts was "I didn't smoke!" and felt elated.  It's been a pretty good day ever since.  

Keep up the good work, y'all!  Smoking isn't worth it!

120 Hours Smoke Free

Decided to take some inspiration from [this thread from earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/8kl4dl/update_currently_119_hours_smoke_free_you_guys/) for the title.  \(ಠ⌣ಠ\) 

First of all I'm glad to be here. I'm thinking to leave this here in case someone reads this, the stars align, and there's \+1 people that stop smoking.

**How I made this decision:** It was pretty much out of the blue. I got tipsy because of a friend's birthday and took some caffeine from another friend \( to stay awake and work more \). Was cheery and went to bed. Woke up at 6:00 AM and was about to go to gym. I usually have a cigarette\+coffee right after I wake up, but I felt I didn't necessarily crave a smoke, so I decided I'll see how much I can last \- maybe I'll quit. 

Long story short \- I pretty much noticed it didn't kill me as the hours passed and when I had a craving I'd think about: **saving money / no more risks of cancer / self control / more time since a pack a day = \~6mins\*20 just to smoke / if I've gone 8 hours without smoking I'll lose respect for myself if I give in.**

So now I've got a sore throat and chest pains and in the morning i lay in bed unmotivated and **yearning for the sweet embrace of the void**, but I feel great after I get out of bed.

In the moment I get a craving, I focus on what I'm doing at that moment and facing whatever thing I've got to do \- and it's like my brain's been upgraded since quitting. I pretty much have stopped procrastinating by smoking and just solving more problems more efficiently.

It also adds \+10 Morale \+10 Self\-respect

Friends smoke but I've got no problems being around them.

Problems that arise are **what do I do with my hands?** Also when having a beer it's weird not to smoke, or when taking breaks \- I'm on the search for substitutes.

**\(I'm sorry if I'm rambling here and it's hard to read\)**

Lastly, my life's quest right is finding out the best substitutes that give similar pleasure to smoking in some cases. I'm hoping you can help me out here. 

**Does anyone have any good substitute for cigarettes when:**

* taking smoke breaks \(besides the drinking water or going for a walk \)
* going out with friends and drinking
* having morning coffee or coffee throughout the day \(I've found a small cookie is ok so far\)

Thanks for listening &amp; hope I didn't bore you to tears :3

My sense of smell is coming back.

According to my app it has been 9 days and 20 hours since my last cigarette. (I think I'm at the point that if it weren't for the app and my badge on this sub, I would struggle to remember), but after almost 10 days, my sense of smell is coming back in a big way. I stepped out to get some coffee and when I came back to my apartment building, a smoker was outside and jeez, did it smell. Honestly, it was as disgusting as it was heavy, and only reaffirmed my decision to quit. I can't believed that's what I smelled like when I smoked. 

This coffee though? Smells fucking delicious. Happy Saturday, everyone.

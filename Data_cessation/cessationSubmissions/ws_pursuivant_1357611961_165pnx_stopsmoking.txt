50 days, and I (finally) feel great!

Man, I can't believe I'm here--50 days without tobacco! Please hang in there with me, you guys! Do it whichever way works best for you. Tough out the shitty times (dark moods, etc.) by reminding yourself they won't last. Reflect on your daily/weekly successes, and love yourself for being so strong. We can do it! We are doing it!

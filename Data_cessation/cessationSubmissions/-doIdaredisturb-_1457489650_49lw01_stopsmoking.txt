My boyfriend is going through quitting--how can I support him best?

My boyfriend has been a cigarette smoker for ~2 years. Since he started smoking cigarettes, he had also been mixing loose tobacco with weed in his bong. He's been "trying" to quit smoking cigarettes since Christmas but hasn't really cut down on the tobacco-weed combo, so it hasn't been going very well. I've made it pretty clear that I'm not going to stick around with a smoker any longer and he's finally agreed to give up smoking weed completely for 30 days, to help with the tobacco cravings. 

How can I best support him during this time? I know he's going to get irritable but the combo of quitting tobacco and weed at the same time might be a lot to handle.

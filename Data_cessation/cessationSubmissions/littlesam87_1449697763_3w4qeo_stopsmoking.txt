I got my first star!

Feeling very smug and happy :D

Edit: Also I noticed my very first benefit of quitting today. I was ill before I quit and have unfortunately been ill almost solidly since so I haven't noticed benefits like smelling better (couldn't smell), easier breathing etc. Today I noticed that when I take a deep breath I feel like I am receiving more oxygen from that breath. Can't really explain it any better than that so hope someone knows what I mean!

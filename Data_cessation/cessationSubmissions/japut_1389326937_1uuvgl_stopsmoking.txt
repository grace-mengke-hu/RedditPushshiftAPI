Fuck it. I'm doing it. I'm quitting this shit.

I'm really worried. The longest I've ever gone awake without a cigarette was 12 hours, and it was really shitty. I was drenched in cold sweat, shaking, and I can't even describe the cravings. Now I have exams coming up in a week and I'm afraid, with good reason, that I won't be able to concentrate and that I'll fail hard.

But enough is enough. I've been wanting to quit for years, and as someone on this sub said already, there's always a reason for you to delay it. I've been a smoker since I started high school; I haven't felt a smell or a taste properly for seven years now. I lose breath after the tiniest activity. And it's also being a huge waste of money. Fuck that.

The most ideal solution for me would be to cut down to three to four cigarettes a day. I wouldn't even be quitting if that was possible, but it's not. Been there, done that, 50 times, and I've always relapsed back to 1.5 packs a day eventually.

Wish me luck, guys. I have no idea what to expect.

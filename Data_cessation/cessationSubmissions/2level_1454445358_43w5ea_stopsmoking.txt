6 months! A message to would be quitters:"fear not!"

It appeared that my destiny was already written,  I had to cope with a necessary evil (smoking) to enjoy my life and not be overwhelmed by bad stuff. I suspected that this idea would have made me a cynical old man in the future.     

Smoking had a lot of negatives, but I was resigned to the point that for years I preferred to believe that I did not want to quit. Whenever a voice inside my head told me what I was throwing away, I quickly dismissed it.     

Looking back I think that my kids showed me my lack of physical energy, all the time wasted and all the times I had to interrupt magic moments. 
Staying at home or doing always the same things because of laziness was also side effect of smoking.

I acknowledged that I was an addict when I started to feel that smoking made me dirty and that I wanted to feel "clean".

Staying "clean" is a common concept for drug addicts.

I wanted to have a try at savouring freedom so I was more determined than ever. Since I called myself a "serial quitter" I decided to invest a considerable amount of time to learn everything and try everything to quit smoking. After all, quitting smoking is a big deal!.

Six months ago I quit cold turkey, I abandoned the old path leading to certain decay and took a different path. After 33 days my life suddenly was much better (some bad moments were acceptable).  

 It is not just about long term benefits, after a short time you get more energy, more well being and a sense of  accomplishment. Since I do not smoke, every day is an accomplishment, even if I do nothing!
 
 In the book "Freedom from nicotine" it is written that, after a period of adjustment we can enjoy comfortable probation for life. Well, it is so comfortable right now!

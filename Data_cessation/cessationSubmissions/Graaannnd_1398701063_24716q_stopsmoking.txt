Day 1... And It Begins.

I've been a full time smoker for 4 years now. I've wanted to quit for the past year or so but it's never been a good time: too busy at work, big weekend of away planned etc. etc. etc... Who hasn't made that excuse before?

My GF has been pleading/asking/demanding/guilting/incentivising me to quit since I started. The problem being: if your not a smoker then you'll never understand that nothing can make a smoker stop unless they want to. 

Well here I am Reddit - I want to stop smoking NOW. I'm nervous, salivating at the thought of quitting and dreading work in the morning (I take a lot of smoke breaks). But I'm going to quit. Hopefully you guys can help me squash the addiction!

Thanks

I want to want to stop. No idea how to get the motivation to.

I'm 19, daily smoker since I was 16. Amount has varied greatly, at my worst I smoked about one pack every day, now I'm down to maybe 10-15 a day depending on stress and boredom levels. 

During bar outings with my friends I can easily suck up a pack in three hours, you all know the struggle. 

I just don't know how to WANT to quit. I love the feeling of lighting one up. I love how it gives me a moment of peace to myself, I love how weirdly sexy I feel lounging with a smoke in hand, I love how it helps my panic attacks and how social it is. I started smoking because of the social aspect, I've had social anxiety since I was a kid and it has helped me approach new people immensly. I don't have a single friend who doesn't smoke. The fact that I've always been terribly attracted to both men and women who smoke, even before I started myself, doesn't help one bit. 

The only things that's helped me want to stop ever is fear of my teeth falling out, money (I work for minimum wage and with what a pack costs in my country, I easily spend almost ~$200 every month on cigs) as well as party drugs like MDMA or amphetamines, as they always make smokes taste kind of nasty a few days afterwards.

I've tried to stop once, after a surgery, but barely made it the 3 weeks the surgeon had said were mandatory. During this time, I was miserable and noone wanted to hang out with me due to my mood. 
 

So TL;DR: How do you make yourself want to quit when you love it so much, when all the negative health effects haven't really shown themselves yet and when everyone you know smoke? I know I *should* want to quit but I just don't.

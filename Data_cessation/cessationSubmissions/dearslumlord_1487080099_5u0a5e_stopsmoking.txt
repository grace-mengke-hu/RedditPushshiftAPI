Sudden tightness in chest after quitting smoking?

Hey guys, I'm in the process of quitting smoking (only like a day in but that's pretty monumental for me), I know that the cravings will probably suck, but one thing that has been gnawing at me has been this tightness of my chest. Basically, it feels like I have to yawn in order to get a deep, full breath, and I never really experienced this while I was smoking.

Some background: 21, only smoked for not even a year (about 8 months, 2-6 cigs a day), and now I'm starting to worry about this tightness of chest. I don't want to think that I did longterm damage, but who knows. Can someone please give me insight onto what this is? My chest basically feels tight, and I'm somewhat scared.

Thanks

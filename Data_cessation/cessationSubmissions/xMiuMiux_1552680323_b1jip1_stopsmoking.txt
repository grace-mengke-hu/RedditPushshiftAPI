This is really hard...

I don’t know how long it has been since I haven’t had nicotine. I went from over one Juul pod a day, to nothing at all. It’s been at least a week? I just have worsening depression (I’m already medicated for depression and anxiety), worsening social skills, I have horrible memory, fatigue, no interest in anything, and generally just can’t focus and woke up today wishing I was dead. The days blend together and every day I just keep craving it and hoping it will get better and go away. I didn’t realize how badly it would effect my mental health to quit and I’m crossing my fingers it will get better. I think I was way too heavily using it constantly, and it became detrimental and a huge crutch for me to function. I struggle to get out of bed or remember things, my attention span is much worse, etc.

This is fucking horrible and I wish I didn’t use it as much as I did... and I haven’t gone this long without nicotine in about two years. 

Like I said, I don’t even know how long it’s been. I just know it’s been at least a week. I didn’t track when I first stopped so I ruined it for myself... should have written it down, at least. Yet another reason why I think I’m useless and pathetic.

Check-in: Friday, June 19, 2015. Another Friday, and I am not drinking on it.

It's been a long time since the weekend coming was a crisis for me. New folks - you can do this - it's just another day, just do like you did yesterday.

It's been an honor to host the daily check-in this week, but my time is coming to an end. Anyone who wants to volunteer to take this little task for the week of Sunday, June 21 to Saturday, June 27: please either PM me, or respond to this message, and I will pick someone by the end of the day. We do ask that SD-ers have 30 days sober before they volunteer for this.

Thanks!

3 Weeks in...but faultering

I have tried asking advice on how to quit smoking before, so forgive me if this is repetitive; but this time I come to Reddit 3 weeks in and nicotine free. I'm still having near-constant urges to smoke and find myself wanting to smoke even though I haven't had nicotine in 3 weeks. I've bought a vape pen to help with the physical aspect of the addiction (no nicotine in the juice), but my brain is romanticizing the idea of smoking. Any tips from Smokers who quit? How did you stay quit and avoid all of the pitfalls so many of us fall into?

Advice about having a partner who smokes?

Hi all,
I’ve never posted before, so please forgive if this is awkwardly written.

I had quit smoking for a month and a half, then had a weak moment after a few beers and caved. That was a few weeks back, and I’ve been bumming smokes off my fiancé everyday since then (I bought two packs myself, but mostly just taking his). 
He has talked about quitting, but never acted on it. We live together, and he usually leaves the cigarettes on the porch when he’s home, so it’s not like I have to ask to have one. I think he secretly is ok with me smoking, because it takes the pressure off him to quit. He is a pretty heavy smoker, almost a pack a day, sometimes more. 

I know I can’t change his habit, only my own..but does anyone have advice for dealing with a partner who still smokes?

I’ve decided that today I will try again to quit, and do my best to stick with it, cigarettes nearby be damned!

I need to quit smoking

I have been trying to quit for about the past 3 months, but have found it to be the most difficult thing I have ever done in my life. I took Chantix and it seemed to help a little, but I still smoked, even if it was minimal. What are some tips for calming the cravings? What works for you guys/gals when you want to light one up?

Just finished Alan Carr and smoked the last one. A question.

The book really hit me in terms of why the Willpower Method is fraught with difficulty.  I now understand that the anxiety I've felt in previous attempts was a result of thinking that I was depriving myself of smoking rather than escaping smoking.  

I know I'm not quitting anything 'good', I won't be missing out on anything 'good'.  What does Alan mean when he says smoking creates the symptoms it claims to relieve? I get that smoking raises anxiety levels rather than lowers them, but what are some others?  Hope this makes sense!

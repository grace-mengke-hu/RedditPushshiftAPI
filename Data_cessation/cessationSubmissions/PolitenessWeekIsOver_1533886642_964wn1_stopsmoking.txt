The nicotine game is stupid

Initially when I started to smoke I felt so good and genuinely felt that it made me confident (it was the social structure not the cigs), then the effects faded and I couldn't get the same feeling from it. Thus I decided to quit as there were plenty of negatives and no positives from this habit. 

After 45 days the tables are reversed. When I quit, in the 3rd and 4th week I felt like Hercules. I have defeated my most nasty daemon. but then not smoking became normal. And at day 45 I don't get the same warm feeling from the thought of quitting. 

So basically this whole game is stupid. If you smoke that would become the normal, if you don't that will become the normal. Either way its like few days of entertainment and life long cravings. Who came up with this shit?

Quitting the Patch

I quit smoking with the patch, so I didn't have the insane withdraw symptoms so bad. I sometimes wish I would have went cold turkey because giving up the patch wasn't easy either.  The patch helped all the cravings of smoking because I was still getting my nicotine.  The inevitable time came when I wanted to quit ALL  NRTs and  had to get over the hurdle of the patch withdraw (that proved just as bad as my first day quitting cigarettes).    I've been nicotine free for over a week &amp; 27 days without a cigarette.  There is no right way to quit, there is what works best for each individual.  Good Luck to everyone battling.

Who quit with the patch ?? Need advice

I quit with the patch ...I finished the whole program and I am now on Day 3 of no patch ...I have done a ton of reading and I knew what I was up against with having to go through the nicotine withdrawal once I stopped the patch ...but in your experience how long was it until you started feeling better ? ? I am horribly grumpy ! I just feel so irritable and I am not liking the way I am right now :((  I followed the program and I never felt like this during the 7mg step downs so why so strong now and when will I be myself again ??  How bad can the withdrawal off 7mgs of nic really be??? I feel like locking myself away from people until this is done so I can't be a biatchhh to anyone ...ugh!!

Third time quitting in one month.

I have never tried to quit before but I realize each time I try and make it a few days I get better and learn the pitfalls for the next time. Just because you fail once this week why not try again next month?  The more days you go without the more used to it your body is. This third time I wasn't really irritable, just a little anxious. 

I almost bought a pack this morning. So close. I turned around at the last moment. The only reason I was able to do that was learning from the previous times. Don't give up. One failure is meaningless. Even ten is.

Just realized I'm at 50 days no nicotine!

Can't believe I actually made it. Smoker for just under 5 years. Read Allan Carr, tried to quit numerous times but it was actually taking LSD that caused me to accidentally quit, I went from 'wanting to quit' to 'not wanting to smoke' and that made all the difference. 

I do still have dreams of smoking though... Like I'll buy a pack of cigarettes and pull out one, set it on the counter and just stare at it.. and then wake up. But I still haven't smoked!!

12 days and fighting

I smoked for a long time, nearly 20 years, but I don't want to reach my 20iest anniversary being addicted, but is there a point in stopping now? can I even do it? Am I not doomed already? I do not have health issues, shouldn't I cough like crazy, perhaps I'm already gone to far, or I am immune? I have no clue, I only know I want to smoke in this moment, that's why I'm here. I'm also freaked out by those stories I read here: relapsing after a year or two, do I have to be afraid the rest of my life, that a weak moment will send me back to this? And on the other side, why am I writing here? Do I want praise or motivation, but why isn't my free will and declared intention combined with being free for 12 days enough praise and motivation? I'm confused and craving, is this normal? What is normal? Why do we want things? Do we have a free will? I'm so confused I'm inhibited to solve the captcha asking me if I am human ( ok now I'm exxagerating ;) )

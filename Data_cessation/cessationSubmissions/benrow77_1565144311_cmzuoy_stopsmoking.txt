Day one

Haven't had a single cigarette yet today, and the day isn't over yet, but I'm feeling quite strong. 

Reasons I'm quitting:
1) My daughter. She's 8 and I want to be around to see her have kids of her own.
2) Realizing I've been a smoker for over 20 years was a sobering and humiliating thought. How fucking stupid do I have to be to do something so dangerous for so long?
3) It's friggin expensive. At over $10 a pack, between my wife and I, we're spending more on cigarettes than we are on our car payment.
4) I'm coming up on 40 and the mid-life crisis is real. Existential dread? Check. 

I know none of these reasons is unique or original, and if I read somebody else's list, I'd have a hard time caring about their reasons. The point is, you have to figure out what your reasons are for quitting. 

... Take it from somebody who is only on day one.

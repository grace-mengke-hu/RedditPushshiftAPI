Will ya look at my numbers?!

The thing about this subreddit is that the more success you have, the less you'll visit. Smoking is just not something I think about anymore - which is fantastic!  

Watching a few of my friends really struggle with their quit is when I realized how important a subreddit like this is - you guys helped me get through those difficult first few months, the support & inspiration I found here really kept me going.

Wanted to check in, say hello and thank you and encourage those who've just start to KEEP GOING YOU GOT THIS!

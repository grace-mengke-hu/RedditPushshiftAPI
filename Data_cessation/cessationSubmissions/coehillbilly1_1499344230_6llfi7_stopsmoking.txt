23 friggin years. That's enough.

Definitely just getting my feet wet compared to most of you on here. On day two right now and I'm amazed at myself this time around. I want to quit this time. Tried many times but never really wanted it like this. Been vaping, really helps to take the edge off. Mostly just wanted to post this so I can look at it when I am struggling and remind myself how good his feels and how bad I want it. The many people on here are a good inspiration. 



Edit:  everyone here is awesome. Can't believe the positive response.  Just wanted to say a quick thanks for the push in the right direction.

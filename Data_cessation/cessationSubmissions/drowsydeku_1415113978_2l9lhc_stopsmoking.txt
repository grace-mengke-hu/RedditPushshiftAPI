Depression from withdrawal?

I could really use some advice for my girlfriend. She recently to decided to try to stop smoking, which was great to hear. However, the last few days she has been depressed. I'm a assuming this a symptom of withdrawal as this isn't normal for her.

Has anyone else had a similar experience from giving up smoking? What's your advice? Would it be a good idea for her to smoke and gradually smoke less and less and then stop altogether? Or is there some kind of nicotine supplement she should use or is it better to just wait it out?

I'm glad she wants to quit and I want her to, but I don't want her to be depressed. I appreciate any advice you have.

Six Weeks... And Counting!

Ladies and gents, it's now been six weeks since I stopped smoking.

I want to express my gratitude to this community for the support that I've been able to get from everyone here; you're all amazing people!

While stopping is always an ongoing struggle, I know I can always rely on the people here for support! Thanks again!

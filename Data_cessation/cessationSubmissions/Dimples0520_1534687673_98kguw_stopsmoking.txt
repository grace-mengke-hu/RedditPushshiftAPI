Day 23- Does it go away???

Hello Everyone!
Made it to 3 weeks. I can't lie I was really hoping that once I hit this achievement, the cravings would subside. I feel so much tightness in the back of my throat and the only thing preventing me from buying a smoke is that I know it will taste disgusting right now.  Any advice???? Does it ever get better??

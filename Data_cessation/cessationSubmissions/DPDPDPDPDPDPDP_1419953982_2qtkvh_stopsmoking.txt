Passed 6 months. Just dropping by to motivate you

6 months. Time moves so fast. When I quit at the end of june it felt like climbing a mountain. Now I look back and all I see is a very small hill. 

I just want to give new quitter some tips, talk about unexepected benefits, and motivate you. Sorry if longpost.

**TIPS**

* Craving will always pass, wheter you smoke or not.
* If you give in, you will feel like shit exactly 1 second after ligthing up. The smoke will taste disgusting, you will get dizzy, and you will wonder why you did such a stupid thing
* Mindset is everything. Read Allen Carr book. If you think you are depriving yourself, or making a sacrifice, you will never be able to quit / you will just stop for a while and light up again the first time you are sad, drunk, or very happy.
* "But I love smoking when drinking coffee/beer / driving / after sex / whenever". BULLSHIT. There is no "special" cigarette. There is just happy moments in life, where you could never feel complete without a smoke. 
* Fucking exercise. Feel your body getting stronger and stronger. Plus, this will help if you eat too much. I've been lifting for two years, and let me tell you, after quitting my workouts were muuch better. 
* Do not vape/chew/dip and expect to gradually reduce your intake. This does not work. Would you tell an alcoholic to drink 1 beer less each week ? No, it doesn't work. I tried vaping, sure I did quit smoking, but I was never able to stop vaping until I went cold turkey. I couldn't even reduce my dosage.

**Unexpected benefits**

* I used to think I wasn't a morning person. Wrong. I was just a smoker.
Every morning was a struggle to get up and get to work. In fact, before my first couple of smokes I was a zombie. Now every morning I just jump out of bed.
* Taste and smell. Wow.
* I have much more appetite. I started eating breakfast again. It's wonderful.

**Motivational speech**

The only reason we keep smoking is because of fear. Most smokers do not even TRY to quit. Realise your brain is chained to a substance. You are a drug addict, no better than heroin or cocaine addicts. Are you going to let this happen ? Don't you find it amazing how the human mind can build pyramids, send stuff into space, and yet allow itself to be chained to a plant ? You are better than this. Fucking quit now

A question about patches.

Last time I “quit” I used a vape. Vaped for about a year and a big night of drinking got me back on smoking and I’ve been smoking again for about a year.

My brother seems to think the vape is where I failed because he used patches for about a month and hasn’t touched a cigarette in 5 years, but with the vape I kept the oral fixation and the general “ups and downs” of smoking.

I’d like to use the patches this time, but they only describe how soon during the day I have a cigarette to determine which step to start with. I smoke almost a pack a day, but don’t have my first cigarette until almost an hour into my day. 

Should I still start with step one?

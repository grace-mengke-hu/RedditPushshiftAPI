4 weeks!

I feel awesome. New quitters, it gets easier -- I don't think I thought of smoking a single time today except that I knew I was coming up on 4 weeks so I checked in here.  
I tried EVERYTHING to quit before finally trying hypnosis, which (to my great surprise, trust me) finally worked for me. Different things work for different people, but that's what did the trick in my case, for anyone interested.  
Support rays to all! You can get out of this dumb addiction!

3 full days with vape. Toxins gone?

Hi all I've made 3 full days without a cig. I'm 28 days clean from an IV heroin addiction too :-) I have been applying the 12 step program I'm working through NA and AA. Mainly keeping it in the day, handing over my cravings and desire to smoke to a Higher Power and trying to help others stopping the cigs. And yes, if your curious they can be on par with or even stronger than the heroin cravings. However no where near as sinister or dark. For example the addict in me keeps trying to convince me one drink won't hurt, or a few benzos. It will, it will lead me back onto the smack. So thankfully the nicotene cravings, although strong, are black and white - not insidious.

Its going well. I'm on the 6mg nicotene juice. I have some 0% juice too. Going to start mixing them tomorrow so roughly 3mg juice then jump off onto the 0% stuff.

So, going well with the taper. Are all the toxins now outta my body? I'm obviously still full of nicotine but that's fine by me for today.

Thanks.

Starting over is so hard to do...

Well I officially started smoking again about 1.5 years ago.

After a couple small quit attempts I'm ready to do it FOR REAL this time!

My new room mate and I have made a pact to quit together, which should help.

Anyway, I'm on day 2 of no cigs.  Keepin' strong so far...

On day 12. I live in California and we're in a dangerous cloud of smoke right now. It's making me want to say "f* it"

I know that's not the right response, but no one can breathe here anyway, even being inside/with a mask on isn't safe, and, well, there's some stress too, obviously.   
But yeah, craving hard.   
It will pass, it will pass, it will pass.... right?

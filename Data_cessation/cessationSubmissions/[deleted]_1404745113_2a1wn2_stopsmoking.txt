Gave in and bought a pack...

And now I feel very apprehensive, since it is conflicting with what I want so badly versuses what I want in the short term. Bought it because of reasons. Minor reasons I had to make the effort to buy them. 

Would it be good if I went back to my original plan to try to quit when I go to school? I'll be moving cities and won't have any feelings of established habits.

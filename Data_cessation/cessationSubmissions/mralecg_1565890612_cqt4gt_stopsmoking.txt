Slurred speech

Hi all, quit smoking 15 days ago but I’ve been having what I think is a strange withdrawal symptom.

If I stand and talk to someone for more than a few minutes I get kind of “dazed” start slurring my words and start to feel very lightheaded. This doesn’t have to be in person as I’ve had this while talking on the phone, I also notice the dazed and lightheaded feeling when I play video games, this has never been a problem when I’m not trying to quit nicotine. The slurring of my words is mainly in my own head as most people say they cannot notice it, only my Dad has ever said he can tell it’s happening. I’ve had this in the past but no where near as bad, only ever in person in a group, never over the phone or while playing video games, it’s always a lot worse when I try to quit smoking (this is my third attempt). 

Has anyone else experienced this?

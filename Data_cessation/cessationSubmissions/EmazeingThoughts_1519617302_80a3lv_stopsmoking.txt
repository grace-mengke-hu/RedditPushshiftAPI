Will this idea work to stop smoking?

So my dad is turning 60 soon and he has been smoking around a pack a day. He has been smoking for almost 40 years now. He tried quiting a few times but has not succeeded and has basically accepted that he will be smoking for the rest of his life. 

My idea is to motivate him to stop smoking over a period of time by using money.

I decided to allocate $50,000 toward this. 

The plan is to have him smoke one less cigarette every 3 days and have him write down on a paper whenever he smokes a cigarette to keep track. Every 3 days I would give him $500 as long as he is using one less cigarette every 3 days. That would total around $12,500. After he reaches 0, I would give him $1,500 each week for 6 weeks as long as he does not continue to smoke. After the 6th week of not smoking, I would assume that he should no longer have any urge to smoke and I would give him the remaining amount of money which should be around $28,500.

What do you guys think of this plan?
Do you think I should change it to one less cigarette every week instead of 3 days to reduce the withdrawal symptoms even more?

Please leave any feedback or suggestions you have!

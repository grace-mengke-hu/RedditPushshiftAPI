Vacation in 4 days :|

My husband and I are going to New Orleans in 4 days. I'd like to not spend the trip looking for places to smoke. I just had what needs to be my last. I've quit at least 7 times. Honestly, I'd just like to use this post for accountability. If I can make it through today, the peak of the worst will be over by vacation time. My problem is being kid free next week, I plan to drink as much as I care to, and drinking and smoking are some of my favorite pairings. 

I'd appreciate good vibes from random strangers. And I'd like to check in, hopefully not smelling like an ashtray.

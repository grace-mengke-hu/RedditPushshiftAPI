hi!

I've been an avid smoker for 2-3 years starting at 1 cigarette per day to consuming 1 pack per day through out those 2 or so years.

Doing a good ol fashioned cold turkey method and so far so good, looks like this one is gonna stick after many attempts. 

My question is how long would it take for my lungs to normalize?
Basically the whole pack a day thing started when I hit the third year of being a smoker. I'm wondering if anybody here got any experiences to share on how long did it take you to get back in shape without feeling complete and utter shit.

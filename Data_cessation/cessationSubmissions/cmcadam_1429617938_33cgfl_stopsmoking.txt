Do I keep my stars

I quit on 1st Jan and didn't smoke for 100 days after 20 years of smoking. However, I had 5 on Friday night (after drinks) and just had one this morning (no excuse) didn't enjoy them and have no plans to start smoking again. Reason for this confessional is to remind all that you need to keep on quitting even after 100 days. I'm going to keep my badge if that's ok as I'm still a non smoker and have been since new year despite the slips.

Here we go again

I tried and went for a few months on the last attempt. Then I picked it up again a couple months ago. And with every cigarette, I got more angry with myself. And, this week I said enough and that I needed to try this again. So, yesterday, I finished off a pack and I'm trying this again.

Picking myself up, dusting myself off and trying once again.

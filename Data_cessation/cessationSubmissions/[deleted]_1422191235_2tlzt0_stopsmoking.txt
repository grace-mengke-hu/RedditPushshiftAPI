I really want to stop smoking all together and need a bit of a help.

I am 17 years old and am a social smoker all in all. A lot of my friends smoke and I am offered numerous times per week. I am a sporty outgoing guy and really don't like it but I can never bring myself to refuse a cigarette. I feel guilty after smoking and I just don't feel good about myself all the time because of it. It is relaxing and everything but I really just want to stop. I have phases where I stop for about a month or two, but I suffer from depression and often when I am really feeling shitty I will want a cigarette. Is there any advice to help block out people and just have ways to ignore smoking? I use it as a distraction when I feel bad about myself. Thanks, Reddit

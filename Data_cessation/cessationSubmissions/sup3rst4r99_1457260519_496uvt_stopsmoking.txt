Day 10!

So I'm on day 10 and things have been getting a little better actually, but I'm still having a pretty rough time overall. But a lot better since I posted on [day 6!](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/48m3tu/6th_day_off_the_nic_feeling_blue/)

The desire to smoke is almost constant. The insecure empty feeling that Allen Carr talks about has not left me yet. But I'm chugging away day by day and it's slowly fading.

Have an awesome day everyone!

Insomnia as withdrawal symptom

Past the 1st week of no smoking yay!

Nicotine cravings department has been pretty easy on me and I'm actually super happy that my appetite has grown a lot.

But the insomnia is killing me...
I sleep max 3 hours on one go and half of that time is spent "half awake".
I'm mainly interested about how long did your possible insomnia last and did you have any tricks to deal with it?

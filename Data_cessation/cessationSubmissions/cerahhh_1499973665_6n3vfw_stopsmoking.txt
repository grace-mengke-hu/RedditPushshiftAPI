Started smoking at my mum's house

This is really just a rant because I'm annoyed at myself but I do have a query at the bottom about Alan Carr's method

I was on the e cigarette for about a month. I was doing really well other than maybe one night where I had far too much to drink and had one cigarette but that was it.

I came back to my mum's last week as I'm home from uni. She's a smoker and although she's trying to stop smoking in the house, when she's had a drink she smokes in the kitchen. I had a few glasses of wine with her and caved and now I've been smoking cigarettes for the past 5 days.

I'm annoyed at myself. I hate the smell. I hate the constant worrying about my health. I hate the annoying voice in my head that says 'one will be alright' when I know I don't want to smoke.

I'm annoyed. I'm going back on the e cigarette starting now and I'm pretty sure my mum has Alan Carr's book somewhere in the house so I'm gonna look for that. I don't even want to be on the e cig tbh as I know it's just prolonging the inevitable withdrawal that I'm just scared to go through again. 

I quit smoking about two years ago with the Jason Vale's quit smoking in two hours (it's exactly the same principle as Alan Carr's). At the end of his tape he said this method only works once and if you go back to smoking it won't work again because you can't be 'enlightened' twice. I lasted 6 months the first time before I started smoking again. I tried again a few weeks ago but failed miserably. I think it was because his words 'this won't work again' resonated with me. Has anyone here managed to quit with this method more than once? I could really do with hearing success stories

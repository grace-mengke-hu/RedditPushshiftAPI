Two and a half weeks, weird things happening to me

It's been 2 1/2 weeks since I quit and some strange things are happening.

Can't get a good night's sleep. It's usually worse towards morning, I get stuck in some kind of limbo, not asleep but not awake either. Just awful sleep. I've heard this is to be expected, but ... I've become very agitated. My heart starts racing at the first sign of confrontation or every time something mildly unexpected happens. Lately, I have the empty-stomach feeling (like the one you get before riding a rollercoaster) for half the day. It's annoying, counterproductive, and I don't know how much I can fake being my normal self any more.

Please, any ideas are welcome. Please, help me. I don't want to start smoking again, but I need to get back to normality.

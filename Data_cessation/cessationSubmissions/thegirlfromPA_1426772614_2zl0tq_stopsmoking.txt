Still doing this thing!

Had some super rough moments but I am still going strong. I can feel the associations breaking. My coffee in the morning isn't a problem anymore. Driving without smoking has started to feel normal. The worst times for me seem to be after a great meal and when I am done with a task and get a chance to relax for a few minutes before starting the next task. I have been just trying to find other methods to relax and after a meal, I brew myself a cup of coffee now, instead of light up. It's getting easier. And I know it will continue to get easier as the days, weeks and months pass.

How are you all doing? I want to hear from all my circle 2's! (and everyone!)

37 year smoker & 15 days under my belt

It's getting a little better every day, but I won't lie, if I had one right now I would probably smoke it. I'm taking Zyban when I wake up and again in the afternoon, so first thing in the morning is hard.
Vaping a 0mg nicotine tobacco juice helps to take the edge off.
I'm hoping these morning cravings will die down soon. 
I sincerely want to do this, so when I want one I think about all the cons of smoking and I promise myself to not buy any or bum any.
300 cigarettes not smoked. $67.50 not spent. We can do this!

After 10 years, I’m done.

I started smoking when I was 17 years old. I just had my 27th birthday late last year. I never thought my first cigarette would keep me addicted for almost 10 years. 

When I turned 23 I quit until I was 25. All my failed attempts have been because I fell into the idea that I could handle just one, forgetting that just one got me here in the first place. 

In those two years I perused yoga and loved it. I felt like a contradiction when I started smoking again. 

Now that I’m back in a health program at school I find it laughable that I’m still sneaking smokes in between classes. 

Tonight was the last cigarette I will ever smoke. I want my life back before cigarettes. 

Thanks everyone who read all of this jumbled mess of thoughts, I think writing this first post and continuing to do so is key.

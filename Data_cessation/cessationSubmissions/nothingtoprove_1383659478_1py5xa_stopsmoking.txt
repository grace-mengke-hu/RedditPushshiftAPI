3+ months smoke-free!

I missed posting on the 3rd due to fighting the flu, but I just wanted to pop in and let everyone know that the struggles are absolutely worth it!

Since quitting, I've started working out.  I lift weights twice per week, run 3 times a week, and bike (15-20 miles) on the weekends when I can.

I started up the [C25K](http://www.reddit.com/r/c25k) (couch to 5k) training program and am now running 5k (3.1 miles) 3 times per week!  If you had told me I would be capable of doing this 4 months ago, I wouldn't have believed you!

I seriously cannot tell you how much better I feel being able to BREATH again!  So for everyone out there who are struggling through the first few days or weeks, HANG IN THERE!  I can honestly say that I haven't had a craving in months and I hardly ever even think about smoking anymore, except when I come here and read through these posts.  It gets better, everyone!  Please, please, PLEASE believe me!

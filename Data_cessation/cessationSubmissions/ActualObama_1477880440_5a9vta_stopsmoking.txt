Will quitting cigarettes make anxiety better or worse?

I'm not a huge smoker. Currently I only smoke about 3-5 cigarettes a day. Sometimes up to 7 on days that I'm drinking.

I first got into smoking about 2 years ago because I knew it was a de-stressor and I thought it would ease any social anxiety I had. my social anxiety never completely went away.

I did, however, turn my life around completely in the past few months (started meditation, starting going to the gym, and started cutting out a bunch of other shitty habits). I can say that I am much much happier now. 

I am a different person now. But cigarettes are my crutch for social anxiety.

The other day I had a woman tell me that she thought I was very attractive but that the fact that I smelled like smoke was a huge turn off. Now I want to stop. 

But I'm mainly worried about a) the withdrawal period and b) will my social anxiety and mood become worse permanently after quitting cigarettes, or will I become much more calm and be in a much better mood?

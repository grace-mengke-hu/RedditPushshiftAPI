Don't forget. The most important thing is to not give up!

I think many of us know the feeling when we fail. We get discouraged, thinking that we are not able to do it. We say to ourselves that it's not worth it and so on. 

But we all forget that failing is just part of the procedure. The key thing is just to not give up. Because if you do, then you lost for sure. 
You have to get back up. Again and again and again and eventually you will win. 

I've had people tell me that I will never quit or that I will start the next morning again. If I had believed them then I would have never done it.

It's also important how you approach it. Are you trying the same thing over and over again, expecting a different outcome? The next time you fail I want you to ask yourself what caused it. I for example noticed that I can't have any cigarettes in my house. At least for the first weeks. So I changed that and tried again. 

This way you will grow from your mistakes and eventually win


Just wanted to let that out. Hope it helped ;)

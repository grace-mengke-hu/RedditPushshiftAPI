I almost did...but I didn't

Tonight my friend offered me a cigarette. The rationalizations began: "just one won't hurt" "it's not like you're going to buy a whole pack". I had the cigarette in my hand. He lit his, I smelled the smoke, and immediately, I gave him the cigarette back. I sat out there on the porch while he smoked his cigarette, and didn't cave. Fuck yes.

I’m 20

If I quit smoking completely with my health actually improve? Will I actually be able to breathe better and stop coughing and everything or am I fucked from all the cigarettes I’ve smoked, like  I can’t get better just stop getting worse ? I smoke a pack  everyday for 2 years almost i need to quit I want to quit smoking so bad I just fuck up and smoke and when I do I end up being worse than I was before

did I fail?

I went for a walk during lunch time and came across a smoker who was puffing away to glory. As I passed the smoker, I smelled the cigrette smoke coming from the smoker and instinctively without thinking took a deep breath and then walked on.

Wondering if this will be cosidered taking a puff? So far I have been pround of myself for quitting without a single puff.

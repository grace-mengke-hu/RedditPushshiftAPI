Excruciating pain idiopathic peripheral neuropathy in my ribs

I have been up all night in so much pain I could scream.  I know when this crap flares up it takes sometimes a month or more to get the inflammation and irritation down. I can’t do it with a cigarette. I’ve already been through too many of these to know I can’t, once it’s gone I’ll start my quit all over

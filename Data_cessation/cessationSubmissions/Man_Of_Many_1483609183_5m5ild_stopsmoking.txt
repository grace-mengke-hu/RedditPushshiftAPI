Smoking is like picking a scab over and over

I quit smoking nearly 2 years ago and what helped me was realising the addiction is really just the body asking for more nicotine. To satisfy this feeling of not having nicotine you can either wait untill the nicotine is gone from your system or take the easy way out and smoke another. All nicotine does is satisfy the feeling of not having it. Nicotine addiction is like a scab you keep picking at that never is able to heal. In the short term it feels good to relieve the itch but  in the long term you are probably aware of what happens.

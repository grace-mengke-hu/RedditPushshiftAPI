Good aids for quiting smoking ?

Hello. I've been quiting smoking for two weeks now but relapsed twice. I can handle cold turkey for about 5 days but then u get shakey,  flustered and confused, my body is just fighting against me till I have a cigarette.  I was wondering what a good nicotine substitutes that would work in this situation instead of a cigarette?

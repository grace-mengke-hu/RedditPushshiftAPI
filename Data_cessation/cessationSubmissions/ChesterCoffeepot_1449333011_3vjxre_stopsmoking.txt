One Year

I'm 40 years old. I started smoking as a regular habit in about 1993, just before I turned 18. I smoked about a pack a day. Some days more, some days less but I never once tried to quit. 

Finally, about 21 years later, I quit cold turkey. I learned of the death of a former boss. He was a lifelong non-smoker but he died of lung cancer at age 42. He owned and operated a small theater/live music venue/bar. It could've been the second-hand smoke. It could've been genetic, it could've been both. I don't really know. What I do know is it was what finally drove me to quit.

I quit that night, one year ago. It wasn't easy,but it wasn't as hard as I thought. You know the cliche: "If I can do it, so can you". It's true, I was pretty committed to smoking, didn't think I could quit. Anyone can quit, no matter how committed to smoking they think they are. 

Don't bother with vaping or patches or cutting back. Just stop smoking. Embrace the struggle, find ways to enjoy it. The first couple weeks, especially the first few days, can be difficult. Hang in there. 

I have more money, I have better health, I don't stink, I'm not enslaved to nicotine or vapor pens or snus or snuff or any of it. There are ZERO negative consequences to not smoking. I don't care what anyone says, ever. There is no good that comes from smoking. Anything that is "good" about smoking are just rationalizations from an addict's mind.

No hypnosis, no magic, no ritual, no patch,pen or snus. You can do this. I'm not a Jedi master, in fact I consider myself to be somewhat weak-willed at times. When push came to shove in the mental battle that is kicking the nicotine addiction, a new kind of determination kicked in and I conquered it.

My quitting inspired two people close to me to quit also and they did it cold turkey and they both are still smoke free, so what you do can really help other people.

Had one of those smoking dreams last night

It was a very bizarre dream. In the dream, I had gone out drinking with some friends and got hammered. I bought smokes and burned a bunch. Woke up (in the dream) the next morning with a hangover, saw the pack of smokes, felt horrible. 

I woke up (in real life) and felt pretty freaked out until I fully woke up and realized it was a dream. 

I kinda smiled knowing this silly addiction is undoubtedly in its death throes, trying in vain to bring me back. It won't.

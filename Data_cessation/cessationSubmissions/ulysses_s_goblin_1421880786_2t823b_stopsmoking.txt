Feeling really stressed at work. It would be so easy to buy a pack on my way home.

A million little things are popping up that are my responsibility and I just want to run outside for a smoke. Argh!



**UPDATE: Home from work. I didn't buy a pack, didn't smoke a cigarette. I'm feeling a lot better, and you guys are the best. Thank you the support and encouragement. It's really nice to know there are all these internet people rooting for me. Have a great night everybody; I'm right alongside you, not smoking.**

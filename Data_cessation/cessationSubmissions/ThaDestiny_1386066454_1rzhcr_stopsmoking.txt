I've got this, thank you fellow quiters!

It just hit me, I didn't smoke for over a month. And I just realized how easy it is for me. Last week a cute girl offered me a smoke and I was able to refuse it without any urge to light it. 

I love the fact that my smell, breath and taste is better. I am not a slave to my habbit anymore. And the stories on this Subreddit helped me to take the step to quit smoking. Thank you fellow quiters!

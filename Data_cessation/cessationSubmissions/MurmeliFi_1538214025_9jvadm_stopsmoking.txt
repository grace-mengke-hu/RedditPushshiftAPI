4 weeks and I nearly gave up a few minutes ago.

Doing my best to remind myself I don't need to smoke and that it would only make me more miserable. Not sure if I'm able to convince myself this time. 

Two of my daughters started fighting and the older one started to act up and not doing what I told her to do. I told her that she would lose her phone if she doesn't obey me and she made a mistake saying "go ahead and break it, I don't care" so now we have a tween with a broken phone and the worst mother ever secretly crying her eyes out and thinking about smoking.

Dreams

Day 28 today! 4 weeks! Have been having some weird dreams lately involving nicotine. I was always a dipper and smoker, and eventually went to swedish snus. Yesterday i was talking to some co workers about what we are going to do when we get home (deployed right now). One of the guys brought up snus abd i though about how much i wanted one. Well, last night i had a dream that i caved and i woke up so disappointed in myself. In the dream my wife and kids were so disappointed that i started again.this time is permanent, i just know it!

Anyone else having weird dreams about relapsing around the 1 month mark?

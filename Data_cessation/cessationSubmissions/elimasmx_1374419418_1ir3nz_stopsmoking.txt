GUYS! I'm not a smoker anymore!

So yesterday I began reading EasyWay and today I put out my last cigarette ever!

Yes, I have tried to quit many times before.. but that was the problem, each time I only TRIED, I didn't quit. I just waited to see for how long could I go on without a smoke.

This time is the last time because I already quit. I don't need or want to smoke anymore and I'm not counting the days until the next cigarette. I am free!

40 days without meditation

Well hello to (almost) 40 days. No serious problems besides the occasional craving and the reaaally annoying quitter's flu (breathing through threw a straw). But there is one thing that I am really struggling with. The meditational thing of those 5 to 10 minutes after one or two beers at night outside. Thinking, contemplating, planning, I concentrated many things in those five cigarette minutes that I miss now. How do you handle it? Grow on those valueable thoughts? Serious meditation? Just standing outside and consciously breathing clean air?

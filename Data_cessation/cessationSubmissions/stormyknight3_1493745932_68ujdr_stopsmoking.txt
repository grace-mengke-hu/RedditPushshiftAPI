2 Weeks - Emotionally Stable

I posted previously how out of whack I felt, and I just wanted to share that I feel MILES better (i.e. less irritable, moody, etc...).  
It really does get better... NOT having to go through that again is what I'm trying to use to keep myself motivated.
Bring on week 3!

I'm quitting smoking so i can gain weight. Tips?

I'm quitting smoking (last cig 2 days ago) so i can force my body to gain weight. I'm 18 years old and have been smoking for 2 years. I'm severely underweight and my metabolism is so fast that i have no way of gaining weight naturally.

My father was also super thin and when he stopped smoking 10 years ago his weight nearly doubled, so i have some positive reinforcement there.

I'm here looking for some tips on quitting (weight-related, not general) and possibly something to warn me about that i didn't know! Thanks in advance!

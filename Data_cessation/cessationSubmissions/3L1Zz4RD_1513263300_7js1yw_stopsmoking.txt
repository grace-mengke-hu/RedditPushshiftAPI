Feeling lethargic. Is it common ?

It has been almost one month and the journey has been pretty smooth. Occasional cravings one or twice a day has bothered me nothing else. Cant even remember when had the last craving. But some of the days i feel too much lethargic and spend all day just playing games and watching movies. Is there any way to motivate myself ? Is this common to happen ? I am concerned as some important exams are coming in the next few months and i need to be on top of my game.

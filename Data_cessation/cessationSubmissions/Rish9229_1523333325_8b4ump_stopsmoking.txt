So many people trying to quit!

This feels good. I'm not alone. Using the app 'smoke free'. Seeing the time elapsed since my last cigarette is a real boost to my will power to stay clean. I can't wait to see the good effects of not smoking for a year. I have just completed 3 days now but have done 2 months before. But i want to see the effects of a year of not smoking. Man i am going to love this. I sing and love sports to i am so going to love this! I am super thrilled to actually uabe succeeded 3 days of quitting. Smoking rollies made me reduce the number i used to smoke but now i feel so good after quitting.

What to do you guys do in place of nicotine to get through your day.

I've been switching around cigarettes, e cigs and snus for a while and I wanna quit. Only problem is that nicotine makes my worklife hundred times easier. Every morning I motivate myself to get to work by thinking how I can get nicotine at work (I have a rule that I cannot have snus/cigarettes at home in the mornings so I'm motivated to go to work). At work the time passes faster because I get small amounts of joy every once in a while and I always have something to look forward to in the near future.



This makes it very hard to motivate myself to quit because nicotine makes my life better at some areas.



What can I use to have these small joys in life without nicotine?

Raport

Hey guys, so i did stop counting, visiting, generally thinking About ciggs. My Ed is gone, i did stop watching porn (not masturbating though, once a week ) stopped eating sweets (im fit but too much sugar is not great, and i really ate tons) 

Through day i would say i think once twice about how it was, but its no biggie, its a reminder. 

To everybody i would say stick to it, believe its possible, once you are through you will look Back and will see it was really easy and worth it. 

Good luck everyone, stay free! :)

Will I recover after 3 years of smoking?

I'm a 20 year old guy who's been smoking consistently now for almost 3 years. I have been seriously considering quitting for good because I've been extremely paranoid of getting lung cancer (or any sort of life-threatening disease for that matter), and I have this feeling that those 3 years have messed up my health for good.

I want to know if I were to quit now, would the damage already have been done? Will I live a normal healthy life or is it too late? Thanks in advance!

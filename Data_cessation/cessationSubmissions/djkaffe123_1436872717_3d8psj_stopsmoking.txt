Feeling depressed

Hello people, about a month ago I quit smoking daily. I've been feeling pretty depressed since then, and now when it's been a month, I'm starting to get nervous, that it won't stop? I was wondering if anybody have experienced the same thing?
I used to smoke a pack a day, and I smoked for like 4 years. It hasn't been a cold turkey either - I've been smoking at parties twice, and in the beginning I smoked once a day.
Advice? Should I see a doctor?

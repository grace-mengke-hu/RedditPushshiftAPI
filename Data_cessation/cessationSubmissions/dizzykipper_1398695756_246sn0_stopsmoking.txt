Question about e cigs

I've smoked for coming up to 6 years now. I've tried multiple times to quit. I was wondering your guys' thoughts on electronic cigarettes? I quit smoking about 2 months ago after getting a Flavour Vapour, and found I didn't need to smoke real ones at all, but was probably taking in more nicotine due to constantly toking on it.

When my ecig broke about a week ago, I found myself back on more cigarettes than I was before, I'm not sure if it was because I got out the routine of smoking normal ones or if my nicotine dependancy is greater.

Have any of you experienced anything similar? I thought I was doing really well, but in hindsight, I had clearly not beaten an addiction to anything. I'm starting to think braving cold turkey might be the way to go. What has worked for you guys?

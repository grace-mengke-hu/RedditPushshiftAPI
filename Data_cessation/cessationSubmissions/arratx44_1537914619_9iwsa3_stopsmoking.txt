Addicted to Nicorette

Hi! I quit smoking in December 2017 and have been chewing Nicorette ever since. For the first 6 months I chewed 4mg and after that 2mg. I chew quite a bit of it - maybe like a piece every 2 hours. It's a problem.

What is the best way to quit this? Should I wean myself off the gum or go cold turkey?

Thanks!

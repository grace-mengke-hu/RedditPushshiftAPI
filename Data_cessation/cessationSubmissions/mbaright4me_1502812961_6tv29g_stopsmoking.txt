I smoke 1-2 cigarettes a day, but can't convince myself to quit

Hey gang,

I've been smoking for a few years now, at first extremely rarely (maybe 4 times a year), but pretty consistently since last year. I generally only smoke about 1-2 cigarettes a day, which I think has made it very difficult for me to quit. I still enjoy it, and since I smoke so little, I have an easy time convincing myself that nothing is wrong with me.

Was anyone else like this? What did it take to help you finally quit?

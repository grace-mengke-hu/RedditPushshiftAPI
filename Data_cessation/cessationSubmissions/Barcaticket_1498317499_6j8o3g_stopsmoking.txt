It's been two months , yet i don't feel these amazing benefits of quitting , maybe it's a lie?

I just feel like people talk too much how amazing it is after quitting , sure not smelling like death is a plus and so is spending less money , but really - some of  you people oversell how quickly you FEEL different. stop lying

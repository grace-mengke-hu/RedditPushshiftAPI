Progress!!

I was around a smoker today (first time hanging out with one since I quit) and she was smoking. I left and could smell the smoke on me and HATED IT. I went home and showered and put those clothes in the wash. Just couldn’t stand smelling like it! I’ve never smelled it on myself like that. Super excited about it.

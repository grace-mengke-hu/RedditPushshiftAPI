Holiday Activated

Hey guys/gals, I’ve been nicotine free for 15 days now. To be honest, I don’t have any or minimal cravings and I have been doing my usual daily routine as when I was a smoker. 
Tomorrrow for the next 4 days,I’ll be on a vacation with my friends so yeah that includes a whole lot of drinking lol. I’m quite confident I would be fine, just thought of sharing it out here. Any support would be appreciated, thanks

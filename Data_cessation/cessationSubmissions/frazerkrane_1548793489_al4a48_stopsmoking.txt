Weight Gain

So I'm 19 days in and I definitely gained some weight. Like 5 pounds. Didn't even really realize it til today lol. I'm fairly athletic and have been going to the gym 5 days a week min, but I really cant stop eating at night. Any tips on how to keep the cravings down? I used to just smoke to suppress my appetite but ya know cant do that anymore

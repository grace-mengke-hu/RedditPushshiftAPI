Back to work

Today was awful. First day back work since quitting, so I couldn't use many of my coping skills. And since I'm back to work, I needed to take my Adderall, which just made the cravings that much worse. Also, my body/mind still associates driving with smoking so my commute was awful. Lastly, started my period so I'm cranky. But, no matter how difficult it was, I didn't smoke!! I wanted to so badly, still do, but I did it. And hopefully tomorrow will be easier and if it's not, at least I know I can do it! Thanks for being there for me today, stopsmoking, your stories helped.

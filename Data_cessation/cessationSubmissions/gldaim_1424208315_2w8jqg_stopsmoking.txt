Hi r/stopsmoking Long time commenter, first time poster. I promised myself that I'd come back and post here once I reach a significant milestone so here I am! :) 

P.s. if you're wondering why 66+1 days ; the proper estimate on the amount of time it takes and average person to make/break a habit is 66 days and i wanted to pick that as my posting day but missed it by a day.

So its been 67 days Wow! Yes the first few days were a bit of a challenge but I've already crossed the two months mark and couldn’t feel better! 

This subreddit was a huge inspiration for me and kept me going through the tough times so I want to take a few minutes to reflect a bit and share my experiences. 


**R/Stopsmoking** - 

This was my most important tool in quitting smoking. I came back every time I had a craving and often found someone who had been through it and made it to the other side. This kept me going. I also came back to keep motivating other people who were just starting. While, this may have helped them, it definitely helped me keep going and maintain a strong resolve. I'd encourage everyone reading this to do the same and keep making this community stronger.

**My experience -** 

Smoker for the past 8 years, started in high school due to peer pressure ( coolness factor - I know better now). Used to smoke a pack a day, but my final numbers were about 12/day. Tried to quit many times but it stuck this time around.  The first few days were rough but not too bad. I had a break during the time, so mostly spent all day in bed hibernating. After a couple of days I started reading and exercising and soon life went back to normal, well better than normal. Looking back it wasn’t too bad of an experience, but I remember it felt gruesome at the time. So if you're just starting to quit and it feels horrible, stick it out, it's the only way it'll get better. Now that I've quit for 2 months I look forward to a smoke free life and reaching the 3 month and 1 year milestone.

**Multiple tries -**

This was probably somewhere between my 7th-9th attempt at quitting smoking. So for those of you who have tried and have fell back into the habit of smoking - NEVER QUIT QUITTING :) . I noticed that in my past attempts I was afraid of quitting and often considered rewarding myself with a cigarette. In hindsight, all my failed attempts prepped me for this one and made it successful. 

**Allen Carr's Easy way to quit smoking -** 

READ IT. READ IT AGAIN. Seriously was a big eye-opener for me. I actually started reading a couple of days after I had quit smoking. I was pretty much sleeping and reading for most of the day. Too many people have recommended the book for you to ignore it. (note: some people (very few) report that it didn’t work for them, again everyone is different and you never know until you try)

**Nicotine Replacement -** 

I tried with nicotine patches in a past attempt but still failed. Try it out if you like, although I must say that the biggest factor contributing to my success was probably the mindset (which the Allen Carr book helped with significantly). However, different things work for everyone, so experiment with these if you must.

**Timing -** 

I quit in the winter break. This was a low stress period for me (no school) and I didn’t see my smoker friends at all so this helped a lot. If you can find a window like this it would probably help your chances at quitting. If you can't - the best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago, the second best is now! :)

**Friends -** 

ALL of my NON-SMOKER friends were happy and encouraging. MOST of my smoker friends were kind of disappointed. This is probably because they don’t want to quit and me quitting reminded them that it was possible. They tried multiple times to pull me back in the fold and get me to smoke. I resisted every time. I'd advise you all to Stay strong! And don’t give in to peer-pressure.

**Exercise -** 

Just google it. There are countless benefits to this. After all the damage those cancer sticks did to your body, don’t you think it deserves to benefit from exercise? I started exercising about 3-4 days after BECAME A NON-SMOKER. It's been a great way of relieving stress. You can lift weights if you like. I started with the 7-minute fitness program and am now looking into bodyweight training (working towards a handstand push up :) ). I have to admit exercising makes me feel so much better about myself. I feel more confident, have an improved posture, and can actually run without going out of breath. There's also the benefits of a better looking bod :)

**Replacement Habit -**

 So I was reading the power of habit by Charles Duhigg a month before I quit. According to the book, habits work in a habit loop (cue -> routine -> reward). For smokers, there are hundreds if not thousands of cues that trigger the routine of having that dreaded smoke. And of course the reward associated with it ( the temporary relief of cravings ), if you really consider it a reward that is. The book explains that you can't completely remove a habit, but only replace the routine with another routine that has a similar reward. For this it is important to observe your cues and compile a list of possible rewards ( or perceived rewards) that you are getting from smoking. I used tictacs ( cheap and effective). Although they didn’t help with the cravings, they helped with the restless feeling in my fingers ( flipped the case open close) and mouth ( tried to suck on the tictac rather than chewing it) . BTW If you happen to read the book, I strongly believe that smoking is a keystone habit, and quitting can positively affect many other areas of your life

**Benefits -** 

Everything that you already know -> More money (bought a new phone as a reward), more time, better lungs, better smell, a feeling of control. 
But other than these common benefits, I also saw a whole range of other improvements in my life. I started forming other healthy habits while taking care not to take on too many new habits. I felt a lot more confident. Didn’t have to constantly worry about how I smell. Started answering questions in class. Expanded my social circle to include more positive and proactive people. Started to feel higher levels of self-worth and self-esteem. Got my sleep schedule back on track (mostly). 

**Disadvantages -** NONE :)  


**Other Habits -** 

I also started forming other health habits around the same time as quitting smoking. I've read that taking on too many habit changes at the same time can strain you and cause you to fail. As a failsafe I told myself that even if I fail in my other habits I'd never go back to smoking EVER. My other habits include - Making my bed right after I wake up, Exercise , Cold showers, No Fap ( this one's controversial but overall I think it helped. I relapsed after 30 days so had to reset my counter), and daily gratitude. I starting date for all these have a spacing of about 10 days so after they all reach 60 days, I plan to start daily journaling, meditation and eating healthy. I highly recommend picking one of these or whatever other healthy floats your boat (There are plenty of subreddits out there catered to supporting you with specific habits). The reasoning behind this is it may help with replacing your existing smoking habit. However do take it slow and only start with small chunks ( for ex: I was only exercising 10mins a day to start with, now I'm at 20mins)


**Stressful events -** 

I almost caved on day 3 due to an argument with family. In hindsight, it was probably me that started this due to the lack of nicotine. This would be an excellent excuse for me to go back to smoking and that nicotine monster to get its fix. I would STRONGLY SUGGEST to PREPLAN A CRISIS STRATEGY. That is in stressful times have a go to coping mechanism already planned out. This could be calling/seeing a friend or journaling or shouting in an empty room/house or coming to this subreddit to vent. Whatever your choice, having something planned out in advance is essential as stressful events do come up unexpectedly in most people's life.


**To sum it all up:**

If you've already quit, Grreat! lets keep each other going! 

If you're planning to quit - Awesome! take that first step and use this community for support!

If you're randomly reading this - Superb! keep coming back!

I hope you all find this useful! and comment if you have any further suggestions/improvements/tips/experiences to share

P.s. - Please ignore any tipos/gramharrs/spalling mistakes ;)

Starting the quitting, but wondering if I can replace my 'break time' with something else?

I've smoked for six years, though not very heavily (but still pretty consistently). I've been noncommittally trying to stop the last few months, but I have one thing that bugs me more than anything else, and that's my smoke breaks. From work, from writing, from drawing, I love taking time away to spend 5 minutes outside. The burning cigarette is like a little egg timer, it feels nice, it's short, and I get to relax and do nothing else. I assume a lot of people had this exact crutch.

So I'm pretty confident that if I can replace smoking in these breaks while still maintaining them, my urges will be a lot easier to handle. Is there anything significantly good at replacing this? I really don't want to go outside for 5 minutes and stare at my phone, it'd be nice to have a 'thing' to take a break for, or some kind of short activity.

I'm guessing the answers will be 1) exercise, but I do that anyway. I go to the gym two times a week for cycling, basketball, and swimming, then also go on bike trips and hiking trips for fun. Stretching for 5 minutes outside doesn't seem that distracting or relaxing. Or 2) just sit outside for 5 minutes (aka, get over it, there's not a 'replacement').

These are fine, and I'm a big boy and can handle being told to 'just do it', but I thought it wouldn't hurt to ask to see if anyone had any good ideas, or things that worked for them.

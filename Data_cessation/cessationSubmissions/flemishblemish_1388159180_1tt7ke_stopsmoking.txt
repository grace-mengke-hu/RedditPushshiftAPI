Finally remembering my dreams again after 5 days of being quit

Hey folks! I'm currently 5.5 days into my quit, and overall I'm feeling great. I've only had a few fleeting moments of wishing I had a cigarette between my lips over the past few days, all of which have faded relatively quickly. 

I have noticed, however, that dreams are creeping back into my sleep (or, rather, they're creeping back into my memory post-wake-up). For the longest time, I barely remembered any of my dreams, and even if I did, I usually only remembered a few details here and there, nothing ever too cohesive. 

Since quitting, though, I can distinctly remember three dream sequences from last night alone - one involving my SO, one where I was watching a James Bond character escape from some bad guys from a bird's eye view, and one involving a $70 personal pizza, which I refused to pay for but ate in a few giant bites. 

The fact that I remember these dreams is cool enough as it is, but that I remember so many of the details as well is just awesome to me. 

Has anyone else experienced a sudden return of their dreams, or the ability to remember their dreams after only a few days quit? Is this something that I can expect to continue, or is it just an early side effect that eventually fades away?

**TL;DR**: My dreams have returned after years of not being able to remember them, after only 5 days quit. Anyone else experience this?

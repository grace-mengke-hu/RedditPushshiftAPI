Professional replapser, here's why..

I've attempted and relapsed at least 4x in the past 2 years. The problem is that I don't find smoking disgusting or a bad habit as much as the next guy. I enjoy smoking, and I'm pretty healthy outside of this unhealthy habit. I work out several times a week, take multivitamins and supplements, and make veggie shakes for lunch a few times a week. 
I know, it seems like I'm trying to "cancel out" the bad with some good, but I wasn't always a 1-2 pack a day smoker like I am now, but I was always making veggie smoothies, taking supplements, and into fitness. 
It's been 24 hours since my last cigarette, and I'm trying to use Nicorette lozenges when I have cravings. They certainly do help, but frankly, I didn't/don't give a shit.. I prefer the smoke.
BUT, being smoke free for 24 hours for a 2 pack a day smoker is a huge deal, so I'm making the effort.

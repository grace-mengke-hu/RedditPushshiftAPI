13 hours since last cigarette...

Hours 1-4 were easy. Then I slept from hour 4 to hour 10. 

Hours 11-13... sitting here at work. I want to punch someone. I want to punch everyone. I want to punch myself until I pass out and wake up not wanting to punch everything. 

Fuck me for ever starting to smoke. Fuck me for being such a pussy about quitting. 

This is attempt number 10. Not even bothering with a badge yet. 

All i have to do is make it until after work, then I can go home and sleep. Tomorrow will be easier... right? 

Fuck.

So, I'm waiting for this to become difficult.

I quit about a week ago. I'm not sure exactly. It seems like it would be counterproductive to count the days away. The first few days were somewhat hard...I guess. I've heard a lot about what to expect while quitting, such as coughing up black stuff(which I've never done pre and post quitter). I've "tried" to quit before and failed, but this is the first time I actually intended on going through with it. So has any ever had cravings come later?

6 month check in

First off, congrats to me - just bought my first home.
This has nothing to do with smoking, except that over settlement and actually moving in, there were many cravings.
Fear not, all were ignored.
Thanks to this sub - I know that 'just one' is a bullshit addict lie that we tell ourselves.  I cannot say without countless 'it started with just one' posts that I would have not fell into the same trap over this weekend.  I equate 'just one' with being an addict again.

At 6 months I can say that 'not smoking' is pretty easy.  I rarely have cravings, the closest thing I have to a craving now is watching other people smoke in traffic.  And tbh, I don't think it's the nicotine I miss, just doing something in traffic.

To all those starting out,  looking back, it's hard to imagine why I took so long to quit.  It is so easy to not smoke right now, at this point, I have almost forgotten what it feels like - I don't think of myself as a smoker anymore. 
To all those that have been quit, just never have that 'one' - you can't - that's why you're on this sub.  

The real benefit is not even reduced risk of cancer.  It's all the mental things.  Especially anxiety - cigarettes are the CAUSE of your anxiety / sleep disorders and most likely your depression.  Do your own homework here, as it probably depends on how long you been smoking.

Any other thoughts is over thinking it.  I'm posting this because when I started I loved reading these.  All you have to do is not smoke today.

Most importantly my message is that quitting is worth it, even if you fucked up a few times, even if you quit but aren't sure why anymore.

Stick. With. It.

Can anyone recommend a good non-profit, website with information, tips and general advice to quit smoking?

I quit smoking cold turkey a few days ago, it's going as well as can be expected. I feel like shit obviously but I've quit worse addictions before so it hasn't fazed me.
Anyway, I've been looking around for a good website just for some general advice (besides this subreddit of course) but it seems every fucking website exists purely to shove some nicotine replacement program down my throat, which makes me reluctant to take their word on anything really, because of the obvious conflict of interests. 
I've read too many websites now that end and are littered with ads and subtle hints that quiting 'cold turkey' is impossible and then go on to politely suggest their brilliant 'alternatives' after reading fucking 2 pages of their bullshit. It's pissing me the fuck off.
Sorry, I'm realizing this post might also be a little bit of venting as I'm writing this. 

Anyway, the point still stands, any good recommendations?

Today is the day!

I've finally had enough and I've decided to start this new week by quitting. I've spent the past 12 years smoking on average between half a pack and a pack per day. Back in 2013 I quit for year but fell into the trap that happens to a lot of us. One night while drinking I though "What could it hurt to just have one cigarette?" Before I knew it I was hooked again and buying packs.

I'm sick and tired of feeling like a slave to these things and I drastically need to improve my health. For now I'm just going to take everything an hour at a time and keep myself occupied as much as possible. I'll make sure to keep you guys updated and check in if I need the extra support!

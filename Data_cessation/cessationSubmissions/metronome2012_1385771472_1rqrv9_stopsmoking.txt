Excuse me while I vent.

This is day 3 of not smoking, and I'm super irritated.  I'm mad at myself for thinking about smoking.  I'm frustrated that although I KNOW that I don't actually WANT to smoke (and that's it's the addiction to nicotine that's telling me I do) I keep THINKING about smoking... and it's annoying.  

And look... I want to quit.  I really do.  But I don't want to be one of those people who 3, 4, 5, whatever months (or years!) from now admit that they still wish they could smoke every once in a while.  That is preposterous!  How could anyone succeed in quitting with the mindset that they are 'an addict for life' or whatever and will always think about smoking.  I don't want that to be me. Like I said previously, it's day 3 of no smoking so I'm a bit on edge, so forgive me if I seem rude... BUT if you are one of those people this STILL have cravings after x amount of months or years of quitting... well, I'm annoyed with you for making me scared I'll end up like you.  Actually, wait, maybe I'm not annoyed with YOU per say, but rather with nicotine.  Yes, that's what I'm annoyed with.  Nicotine. 

Nicotine is like a shitty/abusive ex-partner that texts me randomly throughout the day asking if we could just talk one last time and promises things will be better this time around.  No nicotine! We've had this discussion!  It's over! I'd ready to move on already.  

And I would like my brain to catch up.

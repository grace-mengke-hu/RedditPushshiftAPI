Survived a smoking bar

I'm on Day 5 and have been feeling good about it. A dull headache that won't quit, but no chance of me running off to the store. I feel like I'm really going to do this thing. I'm a non-smoker now.

But I went downtown to meet some friends for dinner and a show. I didn't realize the show was in a bar that could have been named Smoker's Heaven. I'm standing there with people smoking on either side of me, practically blowing it in my face, with smoke all around me. 

I know that I have to get used to being around smokers, and I shouldn't need to avoid "temptation" because smoking is gross and I shouldn't envy them for still being in the trap.

I stuck around for about half an hour, mostly because I liked the music and wanted to prove to myself that I can be around it, but I finally just had to get out of there.

 I think I did what I needed to do, but it was still embarrassing that I had to leave early because I'm a recovering addict. This was my first time really being around smokers since I quit, and although I already feel like I'm free, I'm only five days in. I just didn't want to chance it. I've come too far, but not far enough.

I did not smoke today...unless you count half a pack of second-hand. :-P

Relapsed one day short off 3 months

Hiya, I really sorry to tell you this, but I have to be honest. I bought an E-cig and had a smoke. I feel awful for letting you and myself down. I won't go back to patches though. I just have to stop again starting now. I said I would quit by the time I started my new job and I meant it. Sorry again to let you down xxx

This is the message I had to send my wife after relapsing. Not had a reply yet, it feels so shit. If anyone is struggling, please take heed.

I really dislike the taste of cigarettes and they make me spotty and give me puffy eyes. Why is this so difficult?

I'm quitting smoking again, but it's so difficult. 

Cold turkey only, i don't want to prolong withdrawal.

I can't understand why leaving cigarettes behind brings me so much pain and crazy emotion when i don't actually like the damn things

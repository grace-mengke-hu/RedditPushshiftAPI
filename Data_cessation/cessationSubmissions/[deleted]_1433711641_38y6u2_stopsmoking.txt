No more attempts. From now on I am a non smoker.

For 7 years I have smoked. For 7 years I attempted to stop. 

Well no more attempts for me. From this day onward I am a non smoker. I made a list of reasons to begin being a non smoker.

- Money
- Health
- Condition
- Smell
- Hydration
- Shame
- Attractiveness
- Less stress
- Healthy lifestyle
- Strong will

These might be generic reasons but they are just a few of the reasons on my list. There simply are no excuses to counter all the reasons. 

If I ever get weak then I will vape. No more smokes. No more.

Close to 9th day. Its hard for just 3 days, but worth it.

Cigarettes are not so easy to quit overnight, but if you take a decision and quit smoking, believe me, it is only hard for 3 days.cravings are extreme on 2nd day and 3rd day,if you manage to hold up for 3 days then you almost made it.
no craving even after coffee, lunch and dinners.(on 4th day)
For quitting I suggest to read a lot about the lungs and their functioning, their role in supplying oxygen to the body, I am sure you are not going to smoke after you come to know what exactly the lung job is..

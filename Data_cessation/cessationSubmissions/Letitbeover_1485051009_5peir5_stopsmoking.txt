Tomorrow is the day

I have quit at least 50 times. I quit the moment I first saw my positive pregnancy tests all three times. I stayed quit each time until the birth of my babies. Then slowly but surely started again...."only one" Cig at a time. This is my first time posting. I have the smoke free app. I have read Alan Carr 5 times (many diff versions". I have been hypnotized, I have listened to stop smoking books while going to sleep since August. I no longer feel I enjoy them, but for some reason continue on. I seriously feel desperate. Tomorrow is the day. This is my fist time ever posting on a site like this. I have been reading the posts and find it inspiring that so many people have done it. And forever! I have a list of 15 minute tasks to do through cravings. I have had it for a while but never implemented. Tomorrow I will implement!! 🙏🏻

Has anybody here successfully quit using a vaporizer pen to wean themselves of cigarettes?

I'm trying to quit for several reasons, but was having a hard time about it and kept going back to smoking.   I bought one of those vape pens, and haven't had a cig since.  I don't want to rely on those either, but I mainly keep it for when the urge to smoke gets really bad.  I can take a puff or two off the vape and be fine again.

My goal is to completely distance myself from nicotine entirely.  I was just wondering if anyone else had success weaning themselves off of it with the e-cigs?

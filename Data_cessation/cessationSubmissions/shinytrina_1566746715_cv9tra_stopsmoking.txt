Just felt the effects of not smoking for almost 27 days

So I usually sweep, vacuum and mop the floors every 1-2 weeks. It has been 2 weeks since last I did it this time. I noticed that I am not sweating and panting as much this time around. 

I also found out that I need to do it more as I picked up enough cat fur to make a 3rd cat lol

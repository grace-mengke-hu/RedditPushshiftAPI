Just checking in

I don't have much to say, other than I'm  proud of making it this far, thanks partially to this subreddit that got me through those few intense cravings, as well as my now addiction to mint gum :P .  I would just like to let everybody whose going through the very first week ,  that it does get better!! the cravings will come less frequently. distract yourself, with gum, sunflower seeds, go for a jog, It's hard but you are so much better off without that demon on your shoulder. You know you want to stay quit, don't let the nicotine convince you otherwise!!

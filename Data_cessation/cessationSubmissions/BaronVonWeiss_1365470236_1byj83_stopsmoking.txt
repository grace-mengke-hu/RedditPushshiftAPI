It begins.

Time to stop. I quit for 5 months back in the summer of 2011, but sadly relapsed. 

Now I'm in China for work, and since practically everyone smokes - practically everywhere - I've gone up to 30, sometimes 40 cigs a day. That cannot be allowed to happen.

So here we go. I have some patches I brought with me, but I'm going to try cold turkey.

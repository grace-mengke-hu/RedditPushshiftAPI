21 Days

This is starting to feel real! I've quit for almost a year before so I'm not going to get too excited but I definitely am starting to feel like my outlook is changing. 
Last night I hung out with some of my best friends and we played video games and they smoked cigarettes inside so I got a few big whiffs. It's not like I didn't want to have a cigarette. I did. But I didn't ache for a cigarette. I feel like that's a big step.

Thanks to everyone on this sub for the support so far. 21 days!

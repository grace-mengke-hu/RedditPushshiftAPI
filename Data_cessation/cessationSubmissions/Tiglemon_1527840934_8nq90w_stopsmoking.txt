Shitty days

Been having a crazy day the whole day.. started yesterday. Some shit going on.  Yesterday I was able to keep it positive but it's really hard today.

But I've already felt like smoking few times now  fighting it as much as possible. But this stress is not helping. Argh.

Just venting and reminding myself that I'm not a smoker. Thanks all.

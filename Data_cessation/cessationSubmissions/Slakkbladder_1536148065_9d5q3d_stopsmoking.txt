Cold turkey or Patches

I'm going to be brutally  honest here. I have set my quit date for this sunday coming and am absolutely terrified of giving up a habit that I know will kill me. I'm relatively lucky in so much as I can afford to smoke, but I know I have to stop. Question to you lovely people is, Patches or just stop and ride it out?

Help with withdrawal timeline

So I've been smoking for 30 years, around a pack a day (hard to tell because I smoke hand-rolled cigarettes).
I never really tried to stop because I actually love smoking. But now I get more problems than pleasure (am breathless when I bike and so on..)
Now; i'm home with the flu so I have to stop smoking at least for 24 or 48 hours. If not I'm going to get good old bronchitis. I am going to make this momentary stop a definitive one (or at least I want to).
Problem is that every time I don't smoke for a long time I become really really irritable and angry and depressive. It's a real roller-coaster...
Any tips to manage this ?

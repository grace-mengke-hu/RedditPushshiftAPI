Relapse dreams?

Today marks 2 months with no cigarettes or alcohol. As I'm sure you all understand, it has been a challenge. After the first month, I really felt like I was turning a corner and things were starting to get easier - mentally, physically, and emotionally. But for the past week or so, I have been having incredible vivid "relapse dreams" where I imagine myself smoking or drinking or both. The dreams feel so real that sometimes I wake up and get mad at myself for slipping up, and then realize it was just a dream!

Has anyone else experienced this strange phenomenon? Do you ever reach a point where cigarettes are not tempting you at every turn in life?

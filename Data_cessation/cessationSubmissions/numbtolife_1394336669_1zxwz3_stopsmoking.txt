should I try quitting during time off from work?

I've been struggling with my health over the last year. mainly due to overeating and drinking. I'm cutting down on most of the negative things I allow in my life... baby steps right? But I know, for me personaly, cutting back on smoking isn't going to cut it. I have to stop cold turkey.

thankfully, have a job that affords me to take time off here and there. I have two weeks of free time coming up and I want to use that time to explore a new hobby: treating myself better.

I'm mainly worried about my temper/stress so I want to avoid quitting while I'm working.  Does anyone have experience with this? I assume I need to keep myself busy and avoid the triggers.  IDK.... what do you all think?

Such a lovely day.

Today has been a bit different for me - even being in the same routines. I got up, walked the dog then went to do my jogging. Before my jog however, there was this realization that I didn't feel like a smoker. In fact I was feeling pretty awesome despite my not having had enough sleep. 

There's a few people that see me jog every morning. But I rarely talk to them. Main reason is I hear for shit. So it seems ridiculous to bring up conversation. After my jog, which was shorter than usual because of my lack of sleep. This guy asked If I was in the military. That gave me such a big head when I realized why he thought that. I'm out there jogging 5 damn days a week, while most people loaf! I'm also doing it as someone that smoked for 25 years! 

In our conversation it was learned that he was a smoker ( i've never seen him smoke in the mornings, walking his dog ) and said he was unable to quit. Gave him a few tips and mentioned Allen Carrs book.

I feel there should be more to post but there really isn't anything enlightening I can think of. If you are struggling with your cessation, do realize it gets better and easier with time. If things feel very heavy figure out why. Usually its some crap in your head making it seem harder than it actually is.  Oh, and don't forget to breath :)

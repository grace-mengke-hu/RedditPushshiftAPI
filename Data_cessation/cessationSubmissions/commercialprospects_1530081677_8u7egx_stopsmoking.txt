I just quit my 15-year nicotine habit...and I kinda want to crawl out of my skin

I smoked for 7 years, then vaped for 6, and switched to lozenges/gum for the last 2. I’ve been vaguely wanting to quit but didn’t feel ready to make a real push. Then I noticed I was about to run out of lozenges and I decided not to buy anymore. 

My last fix was 10 hours ago. I am really feeling it. It’s starting to sink in that I never truly cold-turkeyed nicotine before, just switched to a different delivery method. I’m feeling mentally resolved, but uncomfortable and nervous about the next few weeks. Thanks for reading, and best to all of you quitting along with me!

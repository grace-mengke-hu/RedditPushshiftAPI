Changes in taste

I know that taste and smell are changed by cigarette smoking, and in past quits I have noticed a big difference in what I could smell. (Thanks to smoking and allergies and having had a couple of surgeries on my sinuses I usually can’t smell much of anything unless it’s overpowering.) This time, I do smell things again, but taste is more of a big change so far. Today I ate lunch at my favorite spot. I always get the same exact things. Nothing tasted as good as it normally does. I can taste everything but it’s not an improvement. I’m wondering if it’s always tasted this way and I just liked the altered version that I was getting as a smoker. I’ll have to come back here again soon and see how it goes. If it turns out I don’t like this place, I’m probably about to lose some weight!  Has anyone else had a noticeable change in food preference after quitting smoking?

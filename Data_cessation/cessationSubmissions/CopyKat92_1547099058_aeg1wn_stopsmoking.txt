I stopped smoking in December to enter 2019 in the worst way.

I stopped while I was feeling less stressed.. Started 2019 with excitement and motivation to end up losing my job. While my car is sitting at a mechanic, while going to the shop to buy something and forgetting to take it for them to tell me I did, so paid money for nothing. While while losing an important document out a window while driving, so many others. It's been an extremely hard week and feels like I am getting all the bad luck in the world... I caved..  I had a Ciggie... I'm so disappointed in myself. However, I haven't bought a box and I haven't had another one nor have I craved one. Staying as strong as I can.

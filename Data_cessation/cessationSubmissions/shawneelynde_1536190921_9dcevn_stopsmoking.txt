Day 4!

I would love to sit here and say I made the conscious decision to quit, but it was a combination of a few things. I am job hunting and haven't had the money to buy them. That's a huge motivator. But I also decided to go ahead and quit, today, on day 4. I've had a handful of cravings a day, but this has been my easiest (and last I hope) attempt to quit so far.

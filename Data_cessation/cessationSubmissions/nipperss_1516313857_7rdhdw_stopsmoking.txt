Found a pea sized lump in my lower lip.

Background: I’ve been a smoker for 4 years, the past three years about 2-3 packs a week. I also smoke pot, sometimes a lot 1/8 a week, sometimes not for 2 months overall for around the same length of time as tobacco. 

Last week I noticed a small lump in my lower lip. At first I chalked it up to my oral fixation habit of biting my cheeks,lips and thought nothing of it other than the fact that it seems deeper in the tissue than a normal mucocelle. Throughout the week I’ve obviously been playing with it and think it’s grown in size slightly. The lump doesn’t hurt, is firm, and is about the size of a pea, a little bigger than a bb pellet. 

I’m trying not to freak out over the big C, as I am only 25 and otherwise healthy, but how can you not when smoking is directly linked to oral cancers. I’m making a dr apt tomorrow for next week. 

Anyways, I’ve quit smoking three days ago when my last pack ran out, but the stress of possibly having cancer REALLY makes me crave a cig or two honestly. Talk about addiction, this will be my Nth time trying to quit. Hopefully the fear of death will keep me at bay haha. 

Idk why I wrote this, but if anyone has gone through something similar I’d love to hear your story.

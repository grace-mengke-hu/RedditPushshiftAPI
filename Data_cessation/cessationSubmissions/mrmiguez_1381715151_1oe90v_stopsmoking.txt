First NFL game!

Was able to catch the Saints vs. the Pats this evening. It was a lot of fun, even though my team lost. I never would have been able to enjoy this before. Before half-time I would have been wondering how quickly I could get out for a smoke.

It gets easier! And you get some many gifts besides just better health.

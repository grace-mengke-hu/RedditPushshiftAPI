2 weeks in , in need of some advice/help.

Hi. 

So long story short. 20 +/- years a pack a day. Anxiety/depression for 10+ years ... 

I have nerver been so comitted to this. This s the things i say to myself every day. 

-To stressed -- smoking wont do shit ! 

-It smells so good when passing by smokerÂ´s -- Dont be stupid , it smells like shit and you know it .

-But , it will help me on my stress levels and trying to loose some weight  -- NO IT WONT , it does absluty shit ! 

-Money ... Think about the money you fucking idiot !!  (Lower class job) ...

I mean i say to myself this every day and it is working better then expected (last tries to quit were a complete failure) .


My problem now is . I am using Nicotinne gum to help me. (nicorette 2 mg) I dont have a lot of them , it says on the paper that the normal is 8 to 12 gums a day , i am having around 6 to 8 , depending on work,coffe,and dinner with wine or not . 

I had a nice family dinner yestarday , lots of wine , no smoking , i did it .

But ... This gum thing is bothering me like shit, as i am still consuming nicotine , and still wake up with nicotine withdrawl . 

I am trying to reduce the gum intake by switching to some regular sugar free gums , i have to be chewing a gum almost all day ... 

Am i being stupid about the nicottine gum ?  Should i keep using and maybe worry if i cant reduce it and/or completly stop using them in 2 months or so ? 

TL;DR , Getting frustated with nicotine comsuption while being smoke free. 

I will not smoke today !

Potential downside to my quit?

I'm a non-smoker, I consider myself that already. I know that I will never pick up a cigarette again, and if I do it'll probably be like 3 years down the line blackout drunk. If I'm even remotely in control of myself I will not touch one, I know this. But it just dawned on me, the smell (and almost certainly taste) is kinda disgusting to me now. It gives me headaches and I don't like to be around it. I can hang out outside with my friends if they're smoking (indoor smoking is a hard no-no for me), like I can be close to it I guess, but I don't enjoy it. So here's the problem that just hit me:

now that I think it's gross....there are all sorts of pretty lady smokers that I'll never be able to make out with without feeling grossed out now :[ :[

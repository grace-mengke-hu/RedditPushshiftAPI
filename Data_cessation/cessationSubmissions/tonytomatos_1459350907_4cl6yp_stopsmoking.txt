Congratulations!!!!

Like the title says, Congratulations to all of you who have quit or are in the early stages of quitting. I am so happy I have found this sub and am pretty sure it added quite a few years back on to my life. 

I smoked nearly a pack and a half a day for 15 years and thought there was no possible way to quit this horrible addiction, until I found this sub and the support from everyone in it. 

SO.....CONGRATULATIONS AND THANK YOU!

TWO WEEKS!

Well, almost, one hour still left until 00:00 here in Hungary, but then I can say confidently that I haven't smoked a single cigarette in 14 days!

Thanks for all your support guys, I don't have any withdrawal symptoms or cravings anymore, even if I'm drinking or out with my smoking friends! :)

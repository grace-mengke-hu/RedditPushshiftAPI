Almost 8 months but...

I'm going to Vegas this weekend. I haven't gone since I've stopped and lately I've been feeling like rewarding myself with cigarettes for not smoking for such a long period of time, scumbag brain! I know I shouldn't, I realize all the hard effort and time I put in will be completely wasted but damnit, I want to smoke so fucking bad. Ahhh

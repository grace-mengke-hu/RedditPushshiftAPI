Scared as shit

Well, I set the date. Next wednesday I am going to quit.

I smoke out of a bad habit, not because I like it, just because I have to. I only see the benefits of quitting and I'm excited about it.

Only thing is, I'm scared. Waking up and can't have a smoke and a coffee while waking up. Being stressed and can't take a break with a cigarette in my hand... 

Any tips on how to get over these moments of freaking out?

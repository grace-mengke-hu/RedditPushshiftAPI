I messed up two weeks in, but I'm not giving up

Well, as the title says. I got pretty sick during my week off from work two weeks ago and before I knew it I hadn't smoked in almost a week. Once I realized I decided to see how long I could make it. Tomorrow would have been two weeks. It was such a wonderful day out and I guess the spring air got to me. I rode my motorcycle to work hoping the fresh spring air would remind me why I wasn't smoking and it worked great for a few hours. I got home after a crazy day at work and had a few beers and having another smoker in the house got to me I guess. 

I feel totally awful about giving in, but when I smoked it almost tasted foul to me and I guess it wasn't quite what I was expecting. I'm not letting this get me down too bad though. I'm going to start fresh on a new day tomorrow. Sorry for the rant all, I just had to get that out I guess.

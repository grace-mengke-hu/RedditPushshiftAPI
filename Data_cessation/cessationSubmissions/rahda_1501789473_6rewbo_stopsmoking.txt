Bonus! Another great benefit.

My life insurance is about to be a whole lot cheaper because I am an ex smoker! It's going to be six months/half of a year in about three weeks since I quit. Wowza!

I never have gotten life insurance yet and I am about to. Fortunately I am 37 and have no serious health problems. It was pleasant to have a congratulations from my agent and to hear that my policy would be a lot more affordable being a non-smoker! 

The positives keep mounting =)

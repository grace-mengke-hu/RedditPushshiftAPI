I'm scared of quitting, last time triggered huge anxiety issues

In 4h I will take my last cigarette, and I'm scared.

I tried stopping smoking once, and the first day I develloped anxiety issue and experienced panic attacks.

I never had problems with anxiety before. I was a very "chill" person, never stressed.

the next 3 months were hell, my doctor prescribed me some anti anxiety meds during those 3 months then I got back to cigarette after 7 month because I had a stressfull day.

This was 7 years ago, for the last 6 years I couldn't run because getting out of breath would remind me of panic attacks and could trigger one. saying/reading the words "panic" or "anxiety" were also big challenges.

I never talked to a doctor about it beside for the first 3 month \(didn't like the anti anxiety meds, I felt like a zombie, unable to think correctly and it did not totally supress my anxiety\)

But during the last year I saw a huge improvment in my anxiety management. I can run now, but I'm still a little bit scared about being out of breath.

\(for those who are wondering, going to a less than 20 grams of carbs a day diet changed everything, I did it to loose weight but after only 4 days my anxiety levels dropped by 95&amp;#37;, and each times I go above 25ish grams my anxiety comes back\)

Now I want to quit smoking again. 

Do you people also get anxiety issue during withdrawal? how do you manage it? are some kind of foods/beverages \(of course let's avoid harmfull drugs such as alcohol and such\) capable of lessening the anxiety part of the withdrawal?

Thanks.

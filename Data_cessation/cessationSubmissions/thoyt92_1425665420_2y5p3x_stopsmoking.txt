Lung health FYI/PSA/whathaveyou

So, I've seen a lot of posts and people asking on here about coughing up mucus once you quit. 

I just want to let everyone know....it's normal. 
This is a comment I posted about a month ago [22 days for me today!]

It takes near a month for your lungs to adapt and start moving things again. Your cilia (tiny little hairs that process air & make it clean) are paralyzed and dead by the hundreds. 
After a few weeks, now that they're not being numbed and deadened every few hours, the cilia can start the cleaning process of your lungs. 

It will take literally almost six months for some people for their lungs to regenerate to their adapted capacity. It all depends on how much you smoked, when, how often, were you a chain smoker, do you live in an urban area (pollution plays a factor).... all these things play into it. 

But keep it up! Just spit out the stuff your lungs are cleaning out. Soon enough, they'll be squeaky clean of those disgusting carcinogens. :)

Odd Feeling in Throat

Hi!  Woke up this morning and my throat feels as though I smoked 2903840382094938 packs last night.  Is this common?  It's happened a few times in the past few weeks, but after nearly a month of quitting, I figured it should have gone away by now?

sorry about my awful grammar.  i JUST woke up.  i can barely function.  kombucha time party time.  

thanks in advance!

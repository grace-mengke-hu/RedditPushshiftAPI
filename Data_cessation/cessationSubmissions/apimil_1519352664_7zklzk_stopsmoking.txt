First time trying

I've been a cafein addict. I'd drink up to twenty coffes a day and decided to stop. Now I only drink coffee about once or twice a month and I feel no cravings.  
I used to smoke ten joints *a day*, now I'm down to one per week at most.  
I used to be addicted to coca√Øne, to keep me going through the day despite the insomnia that was certainly caused by too much coffee. I quit this shit and never looked back.  
  
I smoke twenty cigarillos a day, and I swallow the smoke. One of these things is like four normal cigarettes in terms of nicotine dosage. I burn one down in two minutes top. The first thing I do in the morning is smoking one. My bedroom smell like shit, and my bed is full of ash. Each time I go for a drive I smoke one. After every beer I smoke one. At every school break I smoke one. After sex I smoke two. I spend my 12 minutes break at work smoking. Each time I'm bored I smoke one.   
   
Managed to get it down to 8 today, but to be faire I'm sick as all fuck and I have the baddest sore throat I ever had. I still want to smoke even though it's ridiculously painful. I switched to the electronic cigarette tonight and threw my cigs at the other side of my bedroom. I already feel better not putting *burning shit* in my mouth and lungs, but I still want to smoke.  
  
How comes something that simple is so ridiculously hard to stop.
I haven't spent a day without smoking since 4 years now. I think I''ll force myself to stop for twenty four hours just to see what it does.

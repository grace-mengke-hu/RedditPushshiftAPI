Ranting and some advice.

I've already lost count of how many times I've quit now. It's ridiculous. But I haven't quit quitting. I'm on day 1 again, and I really really want to stay quit this time. I'm scared. Naturally. Summer is here, and so are outdoor parties. Probably more than 80% of my friend circle are smokers. I'm scared I will feel like less of a person when I'm sitting there, without a cigarette. That's just my social anxiety talking. That's just my addiction talking. Smoking makes no difference. It doesn't make me more confident. It dosn't make me satisfied. It doesn't actually give me anything. It only takes. Health. Hygiene. Appearance. And control. The lack of control is my biggest gripe in all of this. I could probably justify all the other negatives, so long as it were my choice. But it's not. If it were anyone's choice, smoking would not be the #1 cause of death in the entire civilized world.

Anyway.

I realized something last night, as I was typing out replies on this sub. It really helps to argue for others. It makes it so much easier to convince yourself it's the right thing to do. My fears washed away when I read what I had typed out. Words that weren't even meant for me hit me right in the heart. But I guess it's because we're all in the same boat. So an advice: Help each other. Motivate each other. In the end it will help you as well. Helping someone else has never felt so selfish. Not that selfishness is inherently bad, but you get my point.

Anyway. Again. Summer is here. And I'm going to enjoy it to the fullest. Without cigarettes. Because with them, I won't be able to. Nicotine is great at implanting ideas and controlling your behavior. It removes pleasure with the illusion that it's pleasurable. Fuck that shit.

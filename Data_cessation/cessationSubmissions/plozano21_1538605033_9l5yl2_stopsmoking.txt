Finally seeing positive changes

I'm about 20 days without a smoke and it has been a terrible month hahaha I got the withdrawal symptoms hard and got depressed and anxious and a bunch of physical symptoms, but they are all gradually reducing over time. I'll still get random outbursts of anxiousness or irritability but nothing like a couple weeks back. Also I can honestly breathe so much easier now.

Anyways just posting cause I know at least for me knowing other people went through the same shit helped, and knowing it's not normal and you're not going crazy does too. 

Good luck fellow quitters and remember to eat healthy, exercise and drink water, that will make quitting so much easier.

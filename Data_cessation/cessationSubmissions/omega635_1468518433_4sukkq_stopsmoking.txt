I'm 19 and I really wanna quit, but I just can't.

I've smoked for 2 years now, and I can feel it's starting to take a tole on me, I used to run every day, work out ect but I haven't done that in at least a year. 

I've had various drug addictions I struggle with to, but even when I quit those drugs I can't give up the cigs. Having all your friends smoke too doesn't help. 


Just looking for some advice, because I really wanna get back in shape and healthy, and smoking half a pack normally, and sometimes 3 packs in a night if I'm drinking, is just not good. I used to not care but for the last 3 months I've been trying but I just can't.

Fell off the wagon!!!

Hi everyone, what a great, motivational site!! Had stopped for 3 weeks and Wong to a family party which are always stressful and may have used this as an excuse to start smoking again. I have given myself a new date to stop and will hopefully use this site as as support if that's ok.

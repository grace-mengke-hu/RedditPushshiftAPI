Struggling with this (difficult) thought right now...

"I'm 28. I have a lot of life left, and living with cravings for the rest of it might just be worse than 'enjoying' smoking and losing a decade at the end. Also by the time I'm starting to have real health problems they'll probably have some kind of miracle cure."

Ridiculous, but that one won't get out of my head today.

Day 4, No smoking and No nicotine; Insomnia.

I am currently on Day 4 of absolutely no nicotine or smoking, however I waited until my body was completely Nicotine free (day 4) to start vaping no nicotine e-juice to help with the psychological side of smoking. I have been able to stand in front of people smoking, being able to smell the cigarettes and not ask for one. Even on my 1st few days; I haven't asked my mom for a cigarette. The thought passed my mind the first day, but later I didn't even consider it. I feel like the first 4 days were just mental preparations onto becoming a non-smoker as I transition to vaping no nicotine juice. I am writing this after been having trouble sleeping and I just took a sleeping aid so I feel weird rn. How long does insomnia will last for?

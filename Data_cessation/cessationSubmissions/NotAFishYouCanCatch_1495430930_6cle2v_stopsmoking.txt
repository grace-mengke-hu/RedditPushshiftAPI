Questions about caffeine and nicotine

I woke up today on my third day of being nicotine free, and drank my usual cup of coffee.

I thought I was going to die. Heart palpitations, sweating, dizziness, nausea - it took a moment for me to remember that nicotine helps metabolize caffeine, and I was just getting a strong 'punch' than I was used to.

The entire episode has made me a bit cautious about drinking anything with caffeine in it, and I was wondering if anyone had attempted to quit caffeine and nicotine at the same time? Are there any benefits to quitting caffeine? For anyone who has made the switch from coffee over to caffeinated tea, have you noticed any differences? For those who have quit nicotine and continued drinking coffee, how long until you felt 'normal' about your caffeine intake again?

Help quitting occasional smoking

Hello,

I have been smoking cigarettes and vaping/hookah occasionally for about a decade. Sometimes I have one or two a day, sometimes none a day, sometimes 3 a day. It’s mostly when I’m driving listening to music or I’ll have like a “celebratory smoke if something good happens kind of thing. 

The thing is, I’m having trouble quitting my bad habit. I don’t get anything out of nicotine mentally I would say but it’s more the habit, the ritual, and the physical motions that I would say I’m addicted too. 

I know some of you are probably worse off here so I don’t wanna downplay anything but I really really want to quit and I’m having trouble saying no since I can rationalize it since I don’t smoke a lot compared to a lot of people. 

Do you guys have any advice or tips on how I should go about quitting this stuff once and for all?

Using dreams

After smoking for 10 years and with the support of my friends and family, I quit a week ago. The cravings have been relatively manageable with the help of the patch. 

The one thing that keeps me anxious is every night I have a dream that includes me smoking. The sensation in the dream immediately fills me with guilt and I wake up thinking that I ruined my streak.

Is this common? Does it go away?

I had been free just shy of three months. Then fell off the wagon again. Starting the rest of my smoke free life now.

One of my closest friends left for the USA. Our ritual over the years was smoking a cigar and sipping scotch on our terrace. I broke the habit of staying tobacco free to have one last such evening. Couldn't stop smoking after that. Resetting badge. Rereading Carr :/

committing to 4 weeks

if i can get through the first 4 weeks, focusing on that amount of time, i'll have proved to myself i can a) quit for longer than i've ever managed before (3 weeks is my current pb) and b) will give my body a chance to see the benefits of quitting. 

the problem so far has been an enjoyment of the act of smoking and a very (un)healthy dose of nihilism (quitting apps usually focus on how much life you've "regained" - this makes me WANT to smoke, if anything). 

it's going to be hard to remember that my reasons for quitting outweigh the reasons not to:
1. i want energy
2. i want to think clearly
3. i want to be able to go to the gym and for it to be enjoyable and sustainable (not likely if i am always wheezing)
4. i am broke and smoking does not help with that

4 weeks, i will keep repeating that to myself. then, on November 14th, i can revisit the situation. hopefully i will reached some of the positives of quitting by then.

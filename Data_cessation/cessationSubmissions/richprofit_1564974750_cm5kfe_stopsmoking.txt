I try. I try. And I try.

I just can't seem to do this.  The longest I've gotten is a month.  I want to quit smoking more than anything in this world.  Is it because I'm weak?  I'm just not mentally tough enough?  Do I need a texting friend?  Will you be my texting friend?  I just don't know what to do anymore.

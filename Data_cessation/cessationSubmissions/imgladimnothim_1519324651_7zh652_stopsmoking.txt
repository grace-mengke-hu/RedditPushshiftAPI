Going cold turkey. Tips on how to stay that way?

I don't even know if I'm addicted at this point, or if it's just the routine side of things that I'm having trouble letting go. I've only been smoking for about 8 months at this point. But the last 3 packs I've been smoking 7 to 10 a day, and that isn't something I'm gonna allow to continue. Anyone have tips on how to keep the idea of smoking off my mind for the next month or two, or however long until I feel like I'm clean for good?

Day 3 - Starting to feel impossible

Day 1 was easy enough, a few cravings but I managed to ignore them. 
Day 2 was surprisingly easy - didn't even think about smoking for the first few hours, not even after I woke up.. Afternoon was very stressful though so that didn't help much.

But Day 3 has not being going well at all though. I'm not sure whether the cravings are just a lot stronger, but it's been extremely hard to ignore them today. My mind is trying to convince me that this is impossible, is giving up really worth feeling like this for the next few months/years, maybe "just one" will help get through this first week.

I know that the cravings will get easier over time - and that "just one" is never just one, but I have a feeling tomorrow is going to be even worse (lots of triggers)... 

My question is how long (typically) until these cravings are manageable again? I really don't want to fail this time, so thought some advice/experience from others might help push me through today/tomorrow at least.

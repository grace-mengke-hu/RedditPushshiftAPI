Day 1

This is my 3rd attempt in 40 years. I managed to go 6 months both previous times, but was always looking forward to smoking again! Which I did, and regretted of course. I'm 60 now and finally am feeling the effect on my health of all those cigarettes. 
So, this is Day 1 for the 3rd and (please!) last time. I'm using the Smokefree app, patches and an e-cig on standby.

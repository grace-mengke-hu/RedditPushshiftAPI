Help me make it out of my relapse!

I stopped smoking about 3.5 months ago. Then I lost my job!! I relapsed! I started using the patch and nicotine gum to help my urges. But it's the morning and I really want to smoke. I have been smoking again. I want to quit and I know if I make it passed three days I am okay for at least a while. It's just getting through these small yet potent temptation periods. I'm going through a temptation period right now. I would appreciate a pep talk. :)

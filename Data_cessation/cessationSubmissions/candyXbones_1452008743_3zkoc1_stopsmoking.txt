I just want to sleep.

Restless. Too hot. Too cold. Nightmares. Roll over. Adjust pillow. Waking up every hour on the hour to just look at the clock and want to throw it across the room. I just want to sleep soundly like I did four days ago before I quit smoking. To everyone with more time than me, when will I finally get a good nights sleep?

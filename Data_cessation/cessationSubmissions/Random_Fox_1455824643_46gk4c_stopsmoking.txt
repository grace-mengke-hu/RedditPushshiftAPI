1 Month!!!!

Seems odd, but I'm so damn proud of my new star flair.

I've been wanting to make this month post for a while.  I've really enjoyed seeing everyone else so happy with themselves for reaching the milestones.  I was a little more than a pack a day smoker for the last ~14 years and now...


I can breath better, I take the stairs at work now for more than just one floor, I've had family comment that I smell better, my house smells better, smells in general are better, tasting better I wake up with energy.  You know... the usual stuff people post about.  I can attest that it's all true now!!  Oh and I've saved $300  :)

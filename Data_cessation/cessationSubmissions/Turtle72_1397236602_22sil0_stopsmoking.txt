2 Weeks!!!!!!!!!!!! Yeah baby!

Thank you all!  Last night at 10pm I made it to 2 weeks without a smoke!  ON day 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 I didn't know if I was going to make it, but with this sub and your support and that of my wife I have at this moment gone:

14 days 12 hours 12 minutes without a smoke
Saved $48.60
Kept 1.451g of tar out of my lungs
And not had 145 cigarettes.

Not only that, but I feel great, have a much more positive attitude, am more mentally clear, feel much better about myself, I don't stink, I can smell everything around me, I don't feel that I have to hide from people as much, and I don't feel shameful because I am not hurting myself with cigs.

Life without nicotine is so much better than it was with it - and it's only been 2 weeks.  

For those struggling, know you can do this.  Hell, if I can do it anyone can!

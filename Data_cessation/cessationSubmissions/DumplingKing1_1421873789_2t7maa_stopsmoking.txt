GF smokes...need advice

My GF is a long time smoker. When she's low on money and can't afford cigarettes she HARASSES me for a few bucks to buy a pack. I'm completely against her smoking and she knows it, but I don't nag her about it. How would you handle this? I don't purchase cigarettes for her, but every time I don't purchase a pack she throws a tantrum and become unbearable.

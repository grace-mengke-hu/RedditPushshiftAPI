Um. Wtf, TGIT and I'm free after four days?

Been a smoker since I was 19, 24 now, smoked a half a pack a day. I quit 4 days ago because I needed to stop smoking weed for a possible job so I was like "fuck, I shouldn't let the demon win." So, I'm on day four and it's Thursday night and I watched my Grey's Anatomy and Scandal and I'm on my third glass of wine and no fucking urge to smoke a cancer stick. I get flashbacks as to what my ritual used to be but I'm feeling invigorated with an injection of life again by being free. Hope this keeps up, quit many times before, but this shit will stick. No demon controls this human's body.

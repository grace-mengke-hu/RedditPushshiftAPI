40 Days and 40 nights

I just keep moving along. 
It is much easier than the terrible first three / four days of physical pain. Easier than the mental or psychological pain of the first two weeks. I still think about smoking. But I am still clear. I can't say it is forever but I hope so. I will just make it through today!

Had a craving, came on this subreddit drank an Ovaltine instead, now it's gone and I'm so relieved I didn't listen to it!

Thank god for 46 days smoke free and best of all 46 days asthma inhaler free! How could I want something that stopped me breathing all the time? :( 

The relief I feel  post cravings when the madness goes away is so rewarding. I know I'm doing the right thing. That was my first craving in about 5 days - I could live with that - but I won't have to! They'll get less and less :)

Day 14 - waves of energy and then fatigue

I'm still having trouble sleeping and eventually just got out of bed at 4:45am. I was in the gym by 6 and rode the bike for 10 mins, did some shoulder work, and a bit of gut work. Finished with a steam/sauna session.  Healthy breaky. At my desk by 7:30.

Today I have gone through waves of feeling pretty energized and totally fatigued. 

I'm not going to smoke cigarettes.

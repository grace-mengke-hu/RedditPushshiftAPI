24 with blood clots

I'm 24 and recently got out released from the hospital, I was diagnosed with bilateral pulmonary embolisms (blood clots in both lungs) and a pulmonary infarction (a blood clot lodged in an artery in the lung that the blood travels through) so I have been smoke free since, 5 days now. I have tried to quit so many times before but I always ended up caving, I think the fact that I'm quitting for my health (and that I haven't drank at all yet) is the only reason I haven't picked one up yet. it is so hard I just try to keep my mind off of cigarettes all together.

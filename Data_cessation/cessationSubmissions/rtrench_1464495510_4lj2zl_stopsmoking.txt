2 months today!

For the first summer in ten years, I don't constantly have a pack of smokes in my shirt pocket. 

Celebrated the occasion by using the money I saved up to purchase a gym membership, looking forward to getting in actual shape with added lung capacity now. 

To all of you struggling to get past that big hurdle, don't fret, because it's possible and attainable and you'll feel a million times better when you're where I am.

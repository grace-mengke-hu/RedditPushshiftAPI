Completed day 2.

Long time lurker here. I smoke mostly when I drink. On a sober day I'd have maybe 4-6 a day as of the past few weeks. But when drinking (about 3-5 nights a week) I crave cigarettes much more and lose count easily. I have attempted to quit multiple times in the past, each resulting in ultimate failure, but I have high hopes I can do it.

   I have caught a cold over the weekend, and decided to give it another shot. The reduced appetite for smoking associated with sickness has made these first two days easy. But I'm afraid I'll be quick to give in once I'm feeling better. I'll be going through a lot of changes this week in addition to the smoking cessation. New sleep schedule, sickness and withdrawal symptoms sound quite miserable. But I look forward to feeling that first full breath after a week of not smoking and the energy boost will prove exercising to be much easier.

   I've read plenty of motivating posts in this subreddit and hope this community can help me help myself. Any recommendations for apps to help track quitting smoking or resources to help get over the cravings and other advice would be much appreciated. Thanks for your support!

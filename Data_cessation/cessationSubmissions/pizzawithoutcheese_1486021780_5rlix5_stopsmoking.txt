i messed up

i feel like a complete shithead. went out and bought a pack after FUCKING 38 hours of not smoking. im weak. how do i reset the badge that i dont deserve? 

i was feeling great until a tidal wave of desperation rolled over me. I may have snorted a line of concerta to get some energy, but it wasn't enough. FUCK. How do you guys do it? I was feeling so excited to put this behind me but now im back to square one.

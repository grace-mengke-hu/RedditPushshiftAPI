What would you say is a good diet for an ex smoker?

I stopped smoking a month ago, I finally felt it had nothing to do with my mood and weight etc. But I did gain some kilograms and that moved me over the line - I am now officially overweight. I've started sport and tried dieting, but my mood swings a lot and I cure that with food now, even though I try not to. 
How do you stop that? I've always been insecure about my weight, never been actually overweight and that's killing me right now. I find myself wanting feeling quite depressed.

Smoking and partying

Hey guys! I am new to this community and it's been 6 days without smoking and I am repressing unexpectedly my urges. But in these 6 days I haven't partied yet and you know alcohol and being smoke free is hard!
My question is have you been able to like smoke just during parties and then ignore it later or I shouldn't think about it ?

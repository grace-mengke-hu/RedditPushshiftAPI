I'm going to finish Allen Carr's book soon (as in a few hours) and really hoping it works!

I am about 1/4 of the way through the book, but am a really fast reader and planning to be done with it tonight.  (I work midnight shift)  I don't know if I truly believe that a book will help me quit, but I figure all I have to lose is $7.00 which I'm already throwing away daily.  Could I really possibly be a non-smoker in just a few hours?!  I would really appreciate any additional tips/tricks and motivation!

I messed up.

Unsubscribed from here months ago thinking I had a handle on things.  I don't.  Relapsed about a month ago and have been back at it with a vengeance.  I'm here to ask for help, encouragement, criticism...whatever it takes to get cigarettes out of my life for good.  Everything is going so great, but I can't seem to cut out the smoking even though I know the consequences.  It seems like I may have a self destructive tendency where I can't just accept the good things without sabotaging myself.  This is more of a ramble than I wanted it to be, but please, anyone who cares to, give me a boost today.  I want to make this fresh start count!

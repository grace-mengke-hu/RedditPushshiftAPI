2 weeks and counting!

Celebrating 2 weeks here. I quit about 3 years ago, didn't smoke for 2 years, then started up a year ago. It's been tough quitting this time around, kept giving up about 2-3 days in to quitting. I thought I wouldn't be able to do it, but it's amazing how much easier it is to not smoke after you get past that 3/4/5ish day hurdle. I'm going to do it this time! I mean, it's not easy, still breaking all the habits and associations, but it's definitely not the hell it was on day 3 or 4.

Some things I'm thinking about to help me stay focused: how not shitty my car smells, that I don't smell like smoke all day, not standing outside in the cold, alone, smoking..., waking up without a sore throat and cough, that it will keep getting easier as I break old patterns.

Thanks guys, and keep up the good work. We can do it!

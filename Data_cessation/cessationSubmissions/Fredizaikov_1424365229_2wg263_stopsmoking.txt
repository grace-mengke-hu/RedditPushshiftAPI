Stopped smoking some time ago

I Stopped smoking like 2 weeks ago (have tried before and didnt last for month) but right now i feel like i have the worst gravings for cigarettes and i dont like it. I also feel like im acting agressive what is totally not me. I was smoker for 5 years and im proud that i quit i just hope can pull it off and never smoke again :)

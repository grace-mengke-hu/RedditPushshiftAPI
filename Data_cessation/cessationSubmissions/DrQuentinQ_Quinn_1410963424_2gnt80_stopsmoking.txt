StopSmoking Confessional Thread

THIS WILL BE A CONFESSIONAL OPEN TO ALL PREVIOUS SMOKERS WITHOUT CRITIQUING ONE ANOTHER.  PLEASE BE COURTEOUS IN THIS THREAD.



Let me start by saying that I wanted to take the time to get all us non smokers in a thread and just get out our thoughts in the open about our feelings on the process of quitting smoking. I have read alot of threads here and we all talk and help one another and I think that's something wonderful. The problem is that when I read some of these threads I can't shake the feeling that some of us here are not being totally truthful with ourselves.  We say alot of what is motivating us on our paths towards smoke free life but there seems to be some hesitation about certain things. Almost as if we're scared to state some things on this sub, possibly out of fear of riticule.  For example I quit smoking 6 months ago. I very much enjoy knowing that I decided to do so. And I can't begin to describe the feeling of elation and confidence that I have grown towards myself to have been able to stay this disciplined and never succumb to the "JUST ONE" fallacy.  But I would be lying if I were to say that when I conversate with a smoker that I don't to a degree enjoy the smell of their cigarette.

This is not a thread intended to romanticize the act of smoking.   It is very clear why each of us chose the path to quit smoking and to become non smokers.  But the cat is out of the bag so to speak and to get to brass tax we are each recovering addicts in the simplest explanation.  We should each be able to convey our thoughts openly to one another and after observation I think being able to confess some things here would be very cathartic to our process. 

 So without further ranting , get all your confessions on the quitting process out in the open and let's have a talk!

Lighting up my last cigarette, here's to a smokeless, cough-free and healthy life

I just lit up the last cigarette I'm ever going to smoke. 

I have said this so many times, but I'm finally ready to rid myself of this burden, it's too expensive, and quite frankly l, "just an honorable form of suicide" (Not my words) 

So I have decided, now at 12pm on February 1st, 2015 that I am not going to smoke anymore.

Cheers to all of you that have already been smoke free, here's to the rest of our lives, free from the evil crutches called cigarettes.

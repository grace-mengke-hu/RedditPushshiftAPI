Opiates and smoking.

I've made some bad decisions. I've been high on opiates for 4 days now.

I started smoking when I was 18. Cigarettes seemed like less and less of a problem relative to the other things I got into: weed, then alcohol, and now this. 

I need to backtrack. I'm out of opiates luckily and will not be getting more. Once I eliminate those I can begin eliminating weed and alcohol. Cigarettes will be the final step. 

I'm too young for this. I'm not a bad person. I can't believe what I've gotten myself into.

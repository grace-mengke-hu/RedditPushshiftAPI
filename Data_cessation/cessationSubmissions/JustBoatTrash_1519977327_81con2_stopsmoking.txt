Drinking and vaping

So I am about 2 weeks into this quit. My brother was smoking while I was vaping 

I can honestly say it stunk and I was happy to keep hitting my vape despite him offering me one. 

 Now comes the challenge of mimosas with friends and turning away their smoke invites. 

Keep pushing everyone I save so much damn time by not smoking.

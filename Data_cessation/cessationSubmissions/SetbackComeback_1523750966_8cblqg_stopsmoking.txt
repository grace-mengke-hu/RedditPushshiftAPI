Working on the Weekend

Hello friends,

Just a quick mini-shoutout to anyone working over the weekend -- whether scheduled or outside of the typical 9-5. A reminder that we're all here together, even if far apart and anonymous (aw), and in slightly rougher spots than our usual.

It gets real simple to our lizard brains real fast:

Sometimes it seems like you *deserve* something for working when most are out having a great time.

Sometimes it feels like you need a good "pal" when no one else is around.

Sometimes it feels like "well, if I just weren't dealing with what I'm dealing with right now, I'd be ready and able to quit...and I'll get there next time, next pack."

Been there and feeling all of those feels with you right now.

We're all better than that. If you've already quit, let's power through and hold onto today, together.

If you've yet to quit and going through some of those same stresses, you're no worse for it whatsoever...we're all on the same journey and the same team -- you wouldn't be reading this otherwise.

If already a quitter, let's keep on keeping on though it all.

If not a quitter yet, we'll be here for you when you get there soon.

Text someone ya love and talk to you great folks again real soon.

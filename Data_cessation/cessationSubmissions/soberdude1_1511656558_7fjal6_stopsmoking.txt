5 Years

Forever grateful to Mr. Allen Carr and the amazing book, The Easy Way To Stop Smoking. I was a pack and a half a day smoker for 40 years. Tried and failed every possible method to quit. Read the book and quit like I turned off a switch. Just celebrated 5 years of freedom from the nicotine monster. If you're contemplating quitting or struggling to stay quit, read this book. Made all the difference for me. New mind set, permanent quit.

2 months (second attempt)

I first tried to quit last year and it went well for around 7 months. On travel my girlfriend (she was quitting as well) and I thought it was a good idea to just smoke some cigarettes because yeah, holidays.. in our 6 weeks of travelling I started to smoke more and more and when I was back home it was the usual thing to do again all they long.

And then it hit me how I hated it. It ruined all my habits of workout in the morning, to do stretching, go for runs etc. I just was not motivated anymore and I smoked even more than in the past. I used every excuse to go on my balcony and smoke one.. (I work at my place..).

So i decided to stop again, and I now know, I will never ever smoke not only one drag of a cigarette or what ever you can smoke. At least for me there is no other way. Now I know how starting again ruins everything I worked on and I will not let that happen again!

Ah and my girlfriend stoped as well, despite her stressful job as a doctor she made it! Sometimes it gets so normal that we have to remind ourselves that we are awesome :) it's good to have someone to be proud of yourself other than you because most people don't care about what you achieved (and I don't blame them). And that's why this sub is so awesome. I often read here just to see how other people do, and I wish all of you achieve your goals!

Going for it. I'm a non-smoker, non-vaper, effective now.

I started smoking about three years ago. Got up to a pack a day, did that until I started coughing up thick mucus, switched to vaping. Tried to taper off the nicotine level in my vapes since then, getting as low as 3 mg. Recently switched to Juul because it's easier, and more discrete, but truth be told I'm over it all.

The amount of money I spend on pods, juices, coils, packs - it's crazy. The fact that I'm actively, and willingly damaging my body while simultaneously worrying about my health every time I so much as imagine a twinge of pain - absolutely wild.

It's no longer fun, I no longer get a buzz, I just do it to avoid the inevitable challenge of stopping, it's routine maintenance for me, but if I keep going this way I'll never stop, and I will have done too much damage. I keep having thoughts about how I would react if I got some sort of lung disease, what that trip home from the doctor would feel like, how those conversations with my parents, my girlfriend would go. 

I think about these things, but I continue to vape, and smoke regardless, but I've realized I need to try quitting again or else these won't be hypotheticals. It's not a matter of if, but when if I don't make a change.

Last week I took the first step, and broke all of my vapes (there were a few, now there are none). Put them in the trash. Had a backup Juul in a backpack I forgot about, and remembered once cravings hit. That one goes tonight.

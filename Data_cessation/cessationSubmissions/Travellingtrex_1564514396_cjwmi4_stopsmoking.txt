I'm at one month now!

Long time lurker, first time poster. I have been watching this sub forever, trying to get the nerve to quit. I've read everyone's stories and upvoted for all your personal achievements and I'm happy to say I can finally share my own! I started smoking at 19 when I was working in bars. Fast forward to a month ago - I was still a half a pack a day smoker. I would hide it from my partner (who swore he would never marry me while I was still smoking, even though I said I would quit from the day we met 4 years ago). I used every opportunity I had away from him to go outside and smoke, lying when I was caught.

I bought a Juul just before heading on a girls trip and I can't say enough about it.  I'm just astounded that it ever happened for me. I think in my heart I was ready, which is the hardest thing you can never explain to a non-smoker, but I just felt like I was at a place where I could leave it. I still smoke my vape fairly regularly, but now I don't have to worry about the smell on my clothes, a bad taste in my mouth, the EXPENSE of smoking. It really has been a positive thing for me, and I hope I won't have to use it forever (I'm trying to wean myself off of it), but, yeah. Just wanted to say that it's totally possible and keep on keeping on.

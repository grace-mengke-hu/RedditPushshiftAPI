My Skin, My beautiful Skin!

So we're 12 days in and I can already see the improvement in my skin. I used to get these recurring zits on my chin and around my mouth that I tried everything to get rid of, but whenever I shaved, it would irritate them and they would almost 'glow' a bright red....it looked like I had mouth herpes....

But! I stopped 12 days ago and no more zits. My skin is now so clear and looks really healthy! My mom used to tell me all the time that in order for the zits to go away all I needed to do was quit smoking, and she was right! 

Guys, if not for anything, do it cause you look wayyyyy hotter not smoking ;)

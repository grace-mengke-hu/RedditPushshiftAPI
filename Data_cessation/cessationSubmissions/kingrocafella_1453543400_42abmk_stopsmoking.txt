20 days after quitting and I have disruptive sleep where I wake up every couple hours?

So this is the second time I've tried to quit seriously in the past six months. 

The first time I lasted about 30 days and took up smoking again. I had similar symptoms with sleep last time but they really seem to be annoying me this time. During the night I'll wake up literally every couple of hours or so, and when I do wake up it's almost like I wake up into a sort of heightened awareness if that makes sense. After this I feel kind of wired and find it hard to go back to sleep. Sometimes I will even wake up 3-4 hours before I intend to get up, and won't go back to sleep. 

This is just happening now, 20 days in. Where as at the start of quitting I was sleeping for long hours, also taking naps during the day. I also have gotten sick which I am sure is related to recovery, and I feel a general malaise and fatigue about my body. 

I am just wondering if anyone else has experienced this before and does it go away? How long does it take for things to start balancing out in the body?

I read heaps of quit smoking timelines eg "in one week you will notice fresher breath" but nothing about some of the less common symptoms of quitting.

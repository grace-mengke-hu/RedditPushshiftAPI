Relapsed at 104 days because a close friend died

One of my best friends was killed in a plane crash. I shouldn't have gone back to smokes, but finished off two packs this week. I'm done with the initial grieving and am starting up the quit again. She always hated my smoking anyways. This quit is for her!

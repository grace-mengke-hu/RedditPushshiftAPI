370 days 6 hours 34 minutes cigarette free!!

I smoked for 14 years and decided last year would be my last year.  And it was: No slip ups, no e-cig, straight up cold turkey and it feels so good!!  I have not smoked 7405 cigarettes!  I am going to Vegas in Feb for 7 nights; this will be my first big challenge.  I may break down and get a 0% nicotine e-cig just to help with the temptation.  But, I made it a year!!!  You can too!  Thanks for the support from this sub, it helps!

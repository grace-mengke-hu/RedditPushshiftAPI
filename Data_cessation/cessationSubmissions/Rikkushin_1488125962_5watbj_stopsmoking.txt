Does weed help you quit smoking tobacco, or is it prejudicial?

Currently trying to quit smoking (2nd time), and I heard from a friend that he started smoking again because of weed, but we usually smoke spliffs (weed with a bit of tobacco mixed in). So I've been thinking that smoking pure weed might help me quit. Thoughts about this?

I'm ok with not smoking weed for a couple of months if it's prejudicial, but I'd rather not to.

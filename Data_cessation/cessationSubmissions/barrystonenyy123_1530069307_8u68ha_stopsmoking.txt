Trying once more

Hello everyone. I’ve been a lurker here, often reading posts while smoking. I’m 27 and have tried quitting at least 5 times a year in my 10 years of smoking. My job is physically demanding and I’m tired of just fantasizing about performing at my peak. I’ve tried most methods of quitting, but I thought maybe a post here will give me a boost. You guys are an inspiration and I’m ready to join you.

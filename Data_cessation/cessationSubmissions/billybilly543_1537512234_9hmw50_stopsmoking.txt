How bad will it be?

Hi, I quit smoking 2 years ago after smoking for \~5 years. It was very hard and I failed multiple times before. I Couldn't sleep good and focus for at least two weeks and had cravings for months.

Anyway, I stupidly went on a 3 days binge -smoking at least a pack a day. I wanna quit again but I have stressful period ahead of me and need maximum focus and rest. 

Do you think it will be as hard(sleep/focus issues) as the first time?

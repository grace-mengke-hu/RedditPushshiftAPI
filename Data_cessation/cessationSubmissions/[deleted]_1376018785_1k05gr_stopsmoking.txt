Last cigarette ever

I'm done.  For good.  Forever.  I've had this nasty cold with a terrible cough for 3 weeks that just keeps hanging around.  I'm 33 and need to take better care of my health.  

I can't afford it any longer.  I'm tired of sacrificing other things out of my life so I can buy another pack of smokes just to kill myself.

Now is the time.  I don't enjoy it any more.  There is no reason at all for me to continue.  I've been 1-2 packs a day for the past 5 years.  I've been thinking about doing this for a while.  Now is the perfectly right time to do this.

Smoking just plain sucks.

I know people post on here a lot that they are beginning.  I just want to post something for myself so I can look back in a day or two or 20 and remember how much I don't want to smoke any more.

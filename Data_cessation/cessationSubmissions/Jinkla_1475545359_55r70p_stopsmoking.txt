Holding a cigarette but not lighting it. Is it really working like I think it is?

The main challenge, for me, is not smoking around my friends when they light one or when I start drinking. But as for just sitting around at home, lately I've been taking a cigarette out of the packet or roll one and then don't light it. I'm doing the same routine just without the smoke. Obviously the nicotine cravings are still there, but a bit of the pressure in the habit that I've built is relieved. Is this actually helping though? Because I'm not actually breaking the habit of smoking, just the nicotine part. I can't tell if I'm winning in this situation.  
This is my first post or comment here, I've been a 12 or 10 a day smoker for a couple months now.

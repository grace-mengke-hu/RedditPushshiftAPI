Smoked whilst drinking...

Hey there, 

I've always thought I never needed help to stop with whatever. In my mind addiction is a weakness which my character didn't facilitate. However, after 10 days of not smoking, alchohol clouded my mind. I smoked another cigarette. I was able to stop it halfway and remember the problems I had quitting the addiction. Kick-off was harder than I assumed. It would be awesome to hear some encouragement.

Kind regards.

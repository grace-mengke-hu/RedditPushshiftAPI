After 145 days of no smoking, I had a cigarette on Friday

I wish I hadn't done it. It wasn't even a good one, but a shitty Marlboro Light. I was drinking and felt like having one though for no other reason but to socialize and maybe enjoy drinking a little bit more. It hit me pretty hard but after the initial lightheadedness, that was about it. Would have been fine if it weren't for the fact that the past two days have now been full of strong nicotine cravings... over just one cigarette?

I would recommend against giving in to "just one." I'm not going to start again, but the fact that I feel like I'm back to square one with fighting the cravings over just one is really annoying. 

Also, should I reset my flair?

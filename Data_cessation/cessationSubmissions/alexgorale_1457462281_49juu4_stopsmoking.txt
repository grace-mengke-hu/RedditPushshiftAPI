Over a year done. Still coughing upstuff. How long did it take you to clear out?

I still cough up the occasional mucus with tar and flecks of black stuff. Occasionally something unique, like a phlegm bubble/air sack or a spiral lung casting. No regular smoker's cough, though.

Ten year smoker here, pack a day at least. Also, have asthma. I exercise 4-6 days a week and cardio is a part of my routine. I drink tons of water and recently began adding lemon juice

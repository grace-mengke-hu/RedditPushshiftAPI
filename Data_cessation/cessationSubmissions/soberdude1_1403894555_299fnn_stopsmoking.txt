Serious Cash

Just got some good news from my Life Insurance agent. Being smoke and nicotine free for over 19 months, my premium will almost be cut in half. Will save me over $1200 per year. Not to mention the $7800 I saved so far, not buying cigarettes. Mostly thanks to Allan Carr's book and the truth. Grateful to be free from the slavery of nicotine addiction. Thanks Mr. Carr and /r/stopsmoking.

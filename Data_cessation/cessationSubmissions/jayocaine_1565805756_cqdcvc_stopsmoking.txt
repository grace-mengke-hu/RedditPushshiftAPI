45 days in and for some reason now I'm really starting to struggle

Is this normal? Before these 45 days it was relatively smooth sailing. Even if I did have a craving it was minor, I was mostly excited that I quit smoking, 10000% confident i'd never smoke again. But now my mind is seriously remembering that something is missing from my life.

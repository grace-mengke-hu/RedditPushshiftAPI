Keep calm and stop smoking

A tip i used to kick the habit. It's been fourteen days since my last cigarette. 

Every time I have the urge to smoke, I drink water or take deep breaths. 

Smokers that claim that they enjoy smoking too much to quit are actually lying to themselves. The best time to quit is right after the last disgusting smoke.

Is there a strong Quit Smoking community online?

 I mean this place is great, but I'm reffering to something big, like with forums, badges, chats, coaches etc. I just keep finding these stock "Smoking is bad - here's why" presentation sites. Maybe there's some hidden CICADA-like place somewhere on the net :)

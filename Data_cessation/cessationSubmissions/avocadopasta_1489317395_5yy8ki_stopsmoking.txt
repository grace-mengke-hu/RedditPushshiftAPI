Finally quitting

So I've smoked for five years for now. Most of the time it has only been smoking with drinks (that has been the situation lately too), but there are couple of longer periods of everyday smoking. Lately it has been really easy for me not to smoke sober, but while not... It always gets out of hand and I have really started to feel bad afterwards. All the money, how it affects my skin and the overall feeling the day after... not worth it!

Also the summer is coming and for me it is lots of sitting in parks and the time that I have always started to smoke more regularly. So I gotta do somethin NOW before the summer is too close. Luckily quite many of my friends have quit recently and many other have been talking about how they don't like that habit anymore. Hopefully I can inspire some of them too with my example!

You have definitely been a huge inspiration for me. Been lurking on this subreddit for a while. I also love all kinds of achievement type things, so this badge is also something that really motivates me. Just kinda sorting my feelings and thoughts here and making this official for me. I don't feel like going to tell all of my friends immediately. Just let them notice what is going on. It feels too much of pressure, what do you guys think of this?

It's gonna be reeeeally though the next time I have one beer in my stomach, but I really want to see that badge evolve. This is the next step I gotta make to become the awesome healthy person I want to be!

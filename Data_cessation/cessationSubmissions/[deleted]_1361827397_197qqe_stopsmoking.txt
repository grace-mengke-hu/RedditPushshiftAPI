Has anybody had any luck with Allen Carr's series?

I've heard good things about [Allen Carr's](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0718194551) book, but it was quite a while ago and the idea of reading it and then "just not wanting to smoke" afterwards does seem a little too good to be true.  

Do any of you have any experience with it?

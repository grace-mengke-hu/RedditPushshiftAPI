CRAZY INSOMNIA

What's up everyone.
Today marks my 25th day without a cigarette (I quit cold turkey) and I have been dealing with some crazy insomnia to the point of worry. It's gotten to the point where some days I just can't sleep (happened twice last week).
Did anyone have similar symptoms? I know insomnia is common symptom of nicotine withdrawal but this sleep depravation is just killing me.

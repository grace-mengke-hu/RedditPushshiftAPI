Does anyone have any advice on irritability?

Suddenly everything around me has begun to irritate me. This goes from the smell of peoples lunches around me to the view of them eating in the side of my vision. This isn't just limited to food but these are two things that are around me at this second. My glasses are starting to irritate me aswell (I dont normally have to wear them so it can be attributed to that). Even small things like barely audible sounds around me. Is this normal? and if it is, what do you do to not let it get to you or how to avoid it etc?

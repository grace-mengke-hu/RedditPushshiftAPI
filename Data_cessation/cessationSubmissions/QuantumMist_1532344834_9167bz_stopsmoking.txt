Enjoying the craving

I've only starting my process of quitting today. Last cigarette I had was last night, and I'd like to share a bit of my thoughts on how it's going so far. To begin with, I decided that instead of fighting my cravings, I would just let them be and observe them, and actually found out that, so far at least, I'm enjoying these cravings, to the point that I don't want to smoke not to let them go. For me, I also noticed that whenever I have a craving, and then just hold a pen the way I would hold a cigarette , I'd have a sense of satisfaction, and the craving would disappear. I actually laughed when I did this and the craving disappeared. 

So I'm either doing this too right or I'm actually starting to get crazy. 

Wish me luck! and good luck to you on your journey!

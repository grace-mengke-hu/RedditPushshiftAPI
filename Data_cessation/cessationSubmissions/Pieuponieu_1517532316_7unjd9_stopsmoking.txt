Allen Carr book--which one?

I have seen tons of folks here swear by "the Allen Carr book" but if you go to Amazon or Audible there are a few variations. Most notably there are:

The Easy Way to Stop Smoking
And
Stop Smoking Now

I'd found on a thread here a link to an audiobook version of Easy Way on YouTube and started it, but it was removed while I was in the middle. I liked the narration, but the audible version is different. 

If anyone can point me to the definitive version of the book and audio book, I'd very much appreciate it!

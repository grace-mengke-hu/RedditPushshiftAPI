I'm so depressed.

I cut nicotine last week. I can't function. Why should I endure life without nicotine? It is barren and bleak and bloated and scarcely conducive to higher thought. Nicotine is my medicine. My antidepressant. 

Why shouldn't I chew the gum and gobble the lozenges until my dying breath? They clear my mind with rays of optimistic clarity. 

It's just so fucking depressing. Everything is filtered through shame and dread. Reading is like building sand castles in a storm. 

This would all end if I gobbled a nicotine lozenge or put a patch on my arm. 

Why shouldn't I?

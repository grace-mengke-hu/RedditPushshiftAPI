How do you ride out an urge?

I'm very interested to hear the methods / tactics / ways that you might employ to 'ride out' an urge, or to cope with a withdrawal pang.

I'm getting kind of used to them but they still come on strong and regularly.  My method is to breathe in and out deeply and try to embrace the feeling like the craving is my friend.

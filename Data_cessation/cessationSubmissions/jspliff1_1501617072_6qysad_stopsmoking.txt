I used it to help me cope

Looking back now and when I would smoke, it was usually when something stressful happened to me, or whenever I felt a strong emotion.

Sad/thinking of my mistakes? Let's light up to feel better.

Angry? Sure why not.

Happy? Well I might as well enjoy myself.

It's interesting now seeing myself being aware of my emotions and learning better ways to cope instead of running outside to hide for a few minutes and then coming back but just being numb.

Stay sy=trong everyone, you got this.

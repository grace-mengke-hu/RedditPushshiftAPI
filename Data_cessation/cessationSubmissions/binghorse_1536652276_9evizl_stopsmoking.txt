How long does it really take to get over cigarettes?

I've been smoking for several years now, always under 5 a day.

I've quit for weeks, months (ish) at a time, but I always seem to get back into the habit because my depressive symptoms come back. I notice that intense cravings go away after a few days, but I haven't ever reached the end to my mood symptoms. 

Has anyone had a similar experience? How long did it take you to get to the end of the tunnel?

One year, zero regrets.

Hello everyone. I'm more of a lurker than a poster but just wanted to check in to say I hit my year mark and I couldn't be happier. To anyone who is unsure about staying the course or perhaps underestimating their resolve, stick with it! I love smelling the fresh grass and having a cup of coffee in the morning without a cancer tube. These days I barely think about cigarettes unless I see someone smoke and even then, I just think about how much I don't want one. Keep at it everyone, I won't smoke today.

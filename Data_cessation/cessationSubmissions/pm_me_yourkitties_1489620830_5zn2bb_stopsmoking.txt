Hey there, stranger

I've been on a backpacking trip in South America for almost three months now and it's almost over unfortunately. I just wanted to let you know that it gets easier.
I quit I think last October after reading Allen Carr's Easyway twice, seven attempts, gum, e-cigs, everything. I think the book and this subreddit are what really helped me in the end.
Now the cravings are like swatting away a fly. I still get them, in fact backpacking and drinking in hostels often has been particularly hard for me. I always, always notice now when someone is smoking. I close a window if it creeps in from outside. I still don't feel 100% safe, but it does get easier. I speak to people all the time who say they could never quit on vacation. Here I am on vacation still doing great!
I hiked the Salkantay trek to Machu Picchu, a five day trip at over 4000m altitude. I could NOT IMAGINE being able to do that while smoking every hour. It was so, so hard even without being a smoker. It made me feel really accomplished, and really amazing, just like quitting has. I'm so proud of myself.
Thanks for reading. If you are losing hope please please stay strong. I know you can do it too.

The real test

Just reached 5 days, probably the longest I've ever come since I've started. I'm 17 now and have been smoking for close to 4 years. I'm managing to cope relatively well however tonight I plan on putting myself in a social setting and grabbing a couple drinks with friends. If I manage to hold back tonight (and I'm determined too) I think I'll be good.

Just felt like venting for those interested :-)

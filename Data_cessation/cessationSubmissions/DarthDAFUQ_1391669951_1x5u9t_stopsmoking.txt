To all new non-smokers!

I just saw a post from a new quitter struggling with the choice to stop and I wanted to share my experience so far. Looking back, all the ways I tried to justify not quitting seem so shamelessly desperate, I'm glad that I haven't faltered since quitting or relied on alternative nicotine fixes, I went cold turkey and it worked so well for me that I forgot about quitting for the last few weeks in fact I was bored at work going through my phone when i noticed my smoking app and I saw I'm already 2 months in, I can't remember the last craving, they stopped after three weeks or so and I haven't been bothered since, it really isn't that hard once you commit to your choice so just hang in there the first few days are so trying but it gets better!
 I'm glad I could come back on here and share my well being and wish you all a easy victory in the fight against tobacco!

1 week tomorrow!

6 days and counting here. I'm using a vaporizer to work the nicotine levels down. Was smoking 2 packs a day over the past 2 years and 1 pack a day for the 8 years prior to that. I started when I was 16 and quit for 2 years total on 4 different attempts but this time is it! My calculations show I'm using about 5-10 cigs worth of nicotine each day and will slowing work my way down to no nicotine. I've lurked on this sub for years and have found the advice and sense of community to be positive and very helpful. Thanks everybody!

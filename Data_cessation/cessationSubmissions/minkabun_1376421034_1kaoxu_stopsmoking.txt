I keep failing...

I tried the patch. I bought an e-cigarette. I'll finish a pack and say I'm not going to buy another one and cave within six hours. The longest I've ever been able to stop was six months and that was almost two years ago. 

Please, tell me ANYTHING that has worked for you. I keep losing hope and feeling like a failure.

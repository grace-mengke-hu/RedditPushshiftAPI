Day 5, quit with Champix & having a wee wobble

I'm 116 hours in and, although I've been a bit uncomfortable and miserable, so far it's been ok. This evening, though, I'm struggling.

I know this is the really hard bit and I just have to get through it, but I'm finding I just can't distract myself - work, reading, tv, Reddit... nothing's quite holding my attention as much as the thought that I could just pop over to the shop and buy some tobacco. 

Any tips for good distractions when you're this agitated? (It's still a bit early to go to bed!)

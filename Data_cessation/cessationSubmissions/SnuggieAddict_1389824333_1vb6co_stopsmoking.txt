The Side-effects megapost!

I see that lots of new quitters ask about side effects, and wonder if they're normal. So, Here's a list of those I had personally and heard of from friends and\or other users. Feel free to add!

Common Side Effects, First few days:

- Headaches

- Stomache Aches

- Anxiety, Depression and Sadness

- Fatigue, Dizziness

- Flu like symptoms

- Coughing up phlegm

- Cravings and Pangs

- Excessive Hunger

- Sore Throat

- Cravings and Pangs

- Constipation

- Mouth Ulcers

- Anxiety, Depression and Sadness


First few months 

- Weight Gain

Don't Talk yourself into having symptoms. These may or may not happen to you. The first week, personally, was hell, The second was bad, and the third was when it started to clear up.

Everything you feel at moment is temporary. You're on the path to being an ex-smoker, and the benefits are endless. In a few days, weeks or months, you'll almost forget about these few rough humps.

Just remember this: One Cigarette can lead you back to being a smoker. And then you'll have to go through withdrawal again!

It was like the universe was trying to tell me something...

I never let myself run out of cigarettes, ever. For months I've been thinking about quitting--I've gotten to the point where I just feel generally unhealthy, and get winded often. I remembered I had e-cigs I'd bought over a year ago, and a few days ago threw them in my car.   

This morning on my way to work, I was running late and discovered I had no cigarettes, which has never happened before. So, I thought about it a few minutes, and decided this might be some kind of sign...or at least an opportunity. 

So, I haven't smoked so far today. 

I'm very nervous about going home tonight. My brain is starting to talk myself into buying a pack already.

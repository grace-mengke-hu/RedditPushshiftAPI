Chewing gum? Tea?

I'm quitting cold turkey now and I'm constantly nervous. I need something to do and often catch myself just eating. 

I don't like to chew on chewing gum all day because I get diarrhea from that stuff and tea is not always an option. What do you do in these situations? 

Sorry if this question has been asked a hundred times already.

I love my non-smoking lungs

I have been cigarette free for a little over 6 months now, and I love it! I can take deep breaths with no wheezing and I can do physically demanding stuff without huffing and puffing like I used too. I can definitely tell that there is a change. 

If you're struggling in the battle, just know that taking a deep breath of fresh air uninterrupted is one of the greatest gifts you can give yourself. :)

Stay strong everyone.

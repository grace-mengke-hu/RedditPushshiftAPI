Smoking withdrawal symptoms?

Today is my 5th day of quitting cigarettes.  So far it's been okay, I supplemented my diet with juices that I drink throughout the day (my awesome gf got me a juicer for xmas).  But today I woke up super fatigued.  I don't have an urge to smoke, but I feel weak...and cold...almost as if I'm getting a flu.  I'm confused because i thought my immune system was supposed to get a boost (even drinking tons of apple/carrot/orange juice).  WTF!

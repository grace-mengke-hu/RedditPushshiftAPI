I fucked up

I hadn't smoked for 19 days until tonight at work.  I bummed a cig from a workmate.  My job is stressful and the only way to take a quick breather is to go out and have a smoke.  I'm thinking I might just try to only smoke cigarettes on the days I work.  I only work 2 days a week since I'm currently in college.  I think it might work since I hopefully won't get back addicted from just smoking a couple cigs two days a week.  What do you guys think?

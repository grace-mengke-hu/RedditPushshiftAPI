It's my 6 months today! :) I've never made it this far. Today I go nicotine-free too

I've been slowly slowly tapering off the nicotine, until I've been at 1x 1mg spray a day, and not having serious cravings. I thought today, being 6 months free would be an apt day to go completely nicotine free. 

I've never made it this long before, and this time just feels different. I have zero desire to smoke. I truly know that doing so wouldn't help anything. 

I know that I might have a few rocky days ahead as the nicotine leaves my system, I'm ready though and I know at least this will be the last time around. 

I don't know what I can say in terms of advice for those less far along than me, the big difference this time has been really wanting it. Like REALLY wanting it. And I know that there's no such thing as just one. It's taken me at least 4 previous fails to really believe that. 

I wish everyone luck, keep it up as its so worth it.

Exercise

Hi all, I'm 3 months in now. It's getting better, anxiety etc is improving and I feel more positive.
One question, has anyone felt like their lung capacity has got worse?
I'm ok walking, sitting, yard work etc but before I quit I was regularly running two miles, now I can't get to one. I can't seem to catch my breath at all. I also experienced no coughing up of anything, just the occasional runny nose so are my lungs still full of bad crap?
I'm going to re-join the gym and start from scratch again but just seems strange

Help please!!

So three weeks into the nicotine patch. No problems at all so far. Every craving has been manageable.  Tonight drinking with my friends in a different city. They don’t smoke but usually when we are here I go outside the whole time to settle my nerves and end up meeting new people. I haven’t had cravings like this that have lasted and I keep thinking.  One won’t hurt ... but I’ve got so far 😐

Hello r/stopsmoking, I'm new here and I just quit after 6 yrs

Hello guys, I'm a 25 years old slightly overweight heavy smoker and I just decided to quit once for all, thanks to your comments and your inspiring commitment. 

This is not the first time I quit, of course, and even if I made my mind a couple years ago about quitting I was still struggling to make it. 

I used to be healthier and more good looking, and all I want now is going back to that. Also, I noticed that smoking is literally killing my self confidence, while a while back I used to picture smoking as something cool.

I'm tired and sick of it. That's it. 

I'm not a smoker anymore.

question for people who like to party

So some old friends are throwing a hosue party and i am psyched to attend but they all smoke. Drinking happens to be my number one trigger so i don't want to drink. My question is to you party goers, have you ever not drank at a house party? whats that like? 



and how do you deal with peer pressure to drink? I'm also driving, so i'm hoping saying that will put an end to trying to make me drink.

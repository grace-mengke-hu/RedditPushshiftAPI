Nipping it in the bud

So I'm an 18 year old freshman in college. I smoked on and off throughout high schoolâ€¦ pretty much only when I was drunk. Unfortunately it developed into a habit as the occurrence of drunken nights increased rapidly when I went to college. I started buying packs consistently in October and have been smoking 7-10 cigs a day since then.

Last night as I was walking back to my dorm after my usual midnight smoke break I saw a friend of mine who I've known my hole life walking into my dorm ahead of me.. She doesn't know I smoke and fortunately didn't see me coming. Regardless I tossed my cigarette immediately and walked around the block to avoid an awkward elevator ride with her, which inevitably would include questions directed at me as to why I smell like stale smoke.

It occurred to me then that I should stop. Not many people know that I smoke, and I don't want to be labeled as a smoker. I honestly love smoking and theres nothing better than stepping outside for a second in the middle of a long study session, but I know it needs to be stopped.

I stumbled upon this subreddit today so I figured I would share my situation. If anyone has any tips for a college student trying to quit, it would be greatly appreciated!

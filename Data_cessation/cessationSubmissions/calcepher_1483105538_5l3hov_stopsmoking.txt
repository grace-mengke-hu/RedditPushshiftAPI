Whats your guys opinions on vapeing?

Im on my second day now and i havent touched a cigarette, im using a vape and feel brilliant! That dull pain in my lungs is gone, i can take a deep breathe, i can walk up the stairs without getting breathless or have palpitations and all around i just feel 100 times better. I know its not completely quitting but as of the moment i feel fantastic and fully confident i wont touch another cigarette.

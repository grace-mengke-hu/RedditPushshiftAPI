Saying farewell to cigarettes. Seeking help and advice.

I am already in my second week without cigarettes. The advantages so far are:

More endurance, i don’t like the smell anymore and thinking about smoking one results in feeling sick. 

A disadvantage for me is that I thought it’d be easier for me since I only smoked for about half a year. I switched to vaping. First with nicotine and then without nicotine and when I vape without nicotine, I don’t really have the cravings to light up a cigarette. 

Today I still felt really nervous and really restless. I was so pushed, I had the need to smoke one to calm down a bit. So I put in some juice with nicotine and everything was as good as always after a few inhalations.

Now my questions to you guys: Am I too fast here? Is there a real chance to quit smoking through vaping (without nicotine)? My goal is to quit with vaping as well. It’s not what I intend to do in, let’s say, one month but I have the feeling I am approaching this too fast. 


Thanks in advance for your feedback and advice!


Sorry for my rookie english, writing it is harder than reading it.

I smoked a cigarette.

I didn’t reset my counter.  (89 days)

I don’t feel regret about it. 

I don’t want to do it again though. 

It wasn’t gross (not like I thought it was going to be) and I didn’t cough or anything. But it wasn’t satisfying. I miss the satisfaction. I switched to vaping, and I’m super glad I did. I stopped smoking after 15+ years. Vaping has always been lacking in something though. Recently I watched a movie, “Secret Window” in which Depp’s character is a secret smoker. Someone who quit, but still keeps a pack, and sneaks cigarettes every now and then. 

I had a friend in high school who’s dad was a closet smoker. 25 years of marriage and she never knew her husband smoked. I guess that had a bit of allure to it. 

I bought a pack thinking “maybe one day I’ll try one”.

That day came, and I smoked. 
The cigarette was much smaller than I remembered (compared to my Juul). And it felt like I was smoking an ultra light. 

I made it about half way and put it out. Not terrible, but not great. About 20 minutes later though I was nauseous. I thought I’d have to pull over. That passed, and I think I can finally say I’m over it. 

I don’t regret it. But I know I’m not going to go back to where I was.

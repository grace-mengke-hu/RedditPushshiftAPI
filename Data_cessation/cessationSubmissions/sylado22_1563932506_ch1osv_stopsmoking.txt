I read somewhere about 3 days, 3 weeks , ...

Tomorrow I will be 3 weeks free of nicotine and today has being HORRIBLE ! It felt like day 3 or worse! Almost the entire day with cravings and wanting to smoke really badly! I am wondering if it might be because of the 3 weeks! I donâ€™t remember exactly where I read it and what exactly said but I remember reading something about the number 3 and how each of those milestones are the worse. When I read about it I though it was a myth but now I believe it is true. Any ways the important thing is that I DID NOT SMOKE! Just wanted to vent my frustration with youðŸ˜„ The comments and support from this community has being of a tremendous help on my quoting! THANK YOU ALL!

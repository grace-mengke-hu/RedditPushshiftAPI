24 yo; 6 year smoker here. Decided to take that leap again, so wish me luck!

Hi everyone,

I've been somewhat of a lurker here the last few months, waiting for my opportunity to become smoke free.

I've been needing to take care of a lot of things in my life; I just quit video games, cutting back on weed etc. and the time has come to quit this nicotine habit.  So a few weeks ago, I brought my habit down to one cigarette a day for some time.

Then yesterday, I forced myself to go through the workday without a single cigarette.

So that makes me 48 hours free and, aside from a little headache, I'm feeling pretty good about right now :)

Let me know any tips or tricks for urges that you guys have come across, or just share your story with me as I've been getting a lot of cathartic relief from these posts.

Thanks for reading!

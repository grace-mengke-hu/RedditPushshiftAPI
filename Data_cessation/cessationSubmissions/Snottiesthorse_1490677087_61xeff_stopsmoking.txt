Never Despair.

Hello my white brothers,

After 2 weeks I feel it is safe to say that I am free of the deadly trap given to us by the Red Indians in revenge for the white man having given them hard liquor and firearms. You can all escape from this trap too, you must keep fighting. My main source of motivation was Hitler. Hitler was the founder of the anti-smoking movement, he was the man who exposed tobacco and revealed to the world of its dangers. Stay strong my white brothers

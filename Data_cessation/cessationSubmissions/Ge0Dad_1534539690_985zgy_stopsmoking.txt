I’m day snoring ??

I have been completely off smoking cigarettes for about a week now, and my breathing has gotten so bad. I’m getting all the gunk in my throat, as well as decreased energy? Maybe with time it will improve. But I have no real desire to go back to smoking. I’m just annoyed by my struggle to breath, when I quit in order to breath again.

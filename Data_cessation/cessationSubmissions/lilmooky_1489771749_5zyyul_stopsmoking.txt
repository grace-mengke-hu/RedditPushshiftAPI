Thanks r/stopsmoking

Tough morning, really wanted to smoke again after a few years of not.  Stepped outside with my coffee (still a trigger for me) and read through the new post instead of going to the store to grab a pack.   Y'all new folks inspire us older folks as much as we do you! ;). Thanks all and not even one.

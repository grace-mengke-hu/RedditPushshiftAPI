I stopped smoking for nearly three weeks and slipped up on Boxing night!!

I gave up smoking 22 days ago and it was going really well with just the occasional use of an inhalator and gum to help with cravings, however I got to Boxing night and was at a party with friends who smoke and I ended up having about six cigarettes! 

I am now really worried about the same thing happening again next time I'm drinking with friends who smoke, I can't avoid them (especially at this time of year) and do not want to slip back in smoking again!! 

Has anyone had a similar experience to this and managed to stay smoke free afterwards? Any advice would be really helpful :)

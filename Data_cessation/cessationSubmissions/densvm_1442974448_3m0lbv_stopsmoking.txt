I just had my last cigarette

Hello, i just had my last cigarette i feel like i had it, i've been smoking marijuana and cigarette way to much for the past years. i thought that marijuana was going to help me deal with my anxieties and it did, until a couple of weeks  when i felt just anxious all the time coulnd't stop moving my legs, feel like a pressure in my chest and is just way to much. I don't want to live like this anymore. Any tips of people who have been in my situation?

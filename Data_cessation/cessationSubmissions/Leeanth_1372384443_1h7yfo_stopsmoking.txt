The consequences of quitting smoking (almost) 10 months ago:

I am getting fat. I purchased new clothes about 9-10 months ago. Two months later, I had to buy new ones in the next size up. 10 months on, I now have to lie down to do up the jeans I'd bought after the first fatism... I have found a lovely dress to wear to my daughter's wedding in August, but will have to have it custom made because I can't buy off the rack any more. My waist is too big for the rest of my proportions. I feel cheated. The fat could have gravitated up a bit... that would have been okay with me. Also, I still cough a lot...

Having said all that, I won't be smoking again, but am just having a bitch about being fat for my height, which is something I never thought I'd ever have to do...

I can't afford to diet. My middle is my only fat part. The rest of me is too thin. If anyone can suggest how to make the fat go upwards so I can have some boobs for my special dress instead of a waist, please post...

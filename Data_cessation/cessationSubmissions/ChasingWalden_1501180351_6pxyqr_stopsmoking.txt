9 Days, $100 Saved, ran a sub 8min mile

I haven't been feeling great today, but I ran a mile for my run streak (think I'm at around 70 days straight). And I destroyed my record. 

Really feeling the benefits of being a nonsmoker. Shocked. 

The mile was 7:47, and I'm a 38 year old female who has been running just a little over a year WHILE smoking 2 packs a day. (21 year habit)

Quitting is taking 2-4 minutes off all my records. Not seconds, MINUTES. 

I'm on a 7mg patch, but that right there ^ is a ton of motivation for me to stay quit. 

Don't wait to quit to start exercising, push yourself until you get pissed at cigs for holding you back. 

I FEEL SO BADASS!

(Sorry for bragging. <3)

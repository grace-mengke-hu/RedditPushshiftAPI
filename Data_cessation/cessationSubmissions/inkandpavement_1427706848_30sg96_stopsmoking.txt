Today is the day

I was dreading this. My fiance and I have been talking about it for quite some time. We never have money. We are annoyed by the complaints by nonsmokers. We've tried to stop before and we almost tore each other apart. 
But today is the day. I started tasting it. It left a bad taste in my mouth. I went on here and lurked, knowing the day would come. People offered book suggestions. I got Allen Carr's and saw my fiance scoff at a self-help book. In all honesty, I'm like that, too. 
But I read it. And now I can't wait to stop smoking. 
I have four cigarettes left. I've decided to finish them. And pay attention. And it's working. Each one tastes terrible. I've started to notice the subtle sick feeling in my stomach every time. I'm thinking of all the times I 'tried' to quit and really examine whether  I was irritable and sick because I was quitting, or because my brain was being a spoiled dumb baby. 
I am my brain. It doesn't make sense to go against myself. This is my decision and throwing a fit about it is insane. 
I can't wait for this, really. I am going to enjoy it. I won't worry about my temper because I won't give myself an excuse to be rude. I will have money in my pocket, and I'll stop wasting time. It's going to be great. It really is. 
I've always been a silent quitter because I always knew I'd never quit. So now, somewhat publicly, I'm making my final decision. 
Today, I'm not a smoker. And I won't be. Ever again.

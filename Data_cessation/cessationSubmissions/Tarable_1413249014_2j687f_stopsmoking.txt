Went out on the town with some friends...

And I didn't smoke!!!  I was surrounded by smokers the entire evening.  I met up with friends three hours away (driving is a HUGE trigger) and made there and back just fine.  Drove my friend to the airport today and did wonderfully.  Cravings are getting easier to manage.

Thank you for all the support, /r/stopsmoking!!!

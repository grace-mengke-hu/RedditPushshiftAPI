Anxiety after quitting

I'm interested and grateful to know how some of you guys deal with anxiety or stress after quitting? Myself, today, I had a conversation with somebody about something that really did not end too well. My usual course of action would be to smoke a cigarette and calm myself down. I didn't allow myself to do this, however I did feel unusually emotional and worked up. I suppose it's part of the process but, any tips would be welcome!!

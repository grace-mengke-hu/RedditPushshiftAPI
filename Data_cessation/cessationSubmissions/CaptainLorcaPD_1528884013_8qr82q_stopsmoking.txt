Still 3 days

I just passed three days.. almost gave in. I‘m on rehab and found an abscess in my leg and went to hospital.

They removed it there with open wound healing. I‘m really done and I wanna go home to my doctors.

I‘m glad I could withstand smoking.. almost bought a pack after that operation.

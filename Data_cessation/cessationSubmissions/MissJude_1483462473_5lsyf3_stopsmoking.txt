I do want to stop, but I also don't want to.

Hello!

I'm here for a piece of advice from you guys who have already stopped killing themselves. I smoke since I was fourteen years old. I want to and have actively made effort to stop like million times since I was nineteen. I swear to God I've tried.

Well, I'm turning 23 in three weeks and still wasn't able to ditch the habit. I know it's disgusting, I feel awful, I snore, cough, sneeze and stink, all my clothes stink, my room stinks, even my behavious sometimes stink due to the constant nervousness. I also have a super hard time managing my money over this stupid habit, since I'm a student and I live alone and pay my own bills.

I know I am stupid and I desperately WANT to stop. But even when smoking the s*it I know in the back of my head that I love it, I love taking a break and enjoy the moment. It's a reward, it'd something connected with pleasure and relaxing.

How do I start really hating it? Please, tell me.

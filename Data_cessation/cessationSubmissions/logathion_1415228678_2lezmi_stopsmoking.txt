6 years...

I just realized the other day that I spent 6 years of my life smoking (18-24). 

It never really seemed like that long. It always seemed like just something I was doing when I was a young dude - never seemed like something I'd done for a long amount of time. 

*6 years*. Having realized this now, I almost feel that consciously recognizing how long I had been smoking might have precipitated me quitting earlier than I did.

I just found this sub today (thanks to that admin blog post). I quit back in February, and for the first time in my time smoking, it lasted longer than a few weeks.

I hope to hang around a bit and join in this awesome community!

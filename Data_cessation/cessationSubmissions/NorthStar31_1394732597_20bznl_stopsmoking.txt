Let's talk about timing and circumstances.

Now I understand there never IS a perfect time to quit, but did any of you guys pick a time when maybe you're less stressed or not going to be tempted? Is it worth it or should I just get through it? I'm a musician and I spend a lot of time either working shows or playing in bars and clubs. Most nights of the week I'm at some sort of show which I think makes it more difficult to quit. I'm always surrounded by smoking and alcohol. 

At the same time though, if I'm staying at home and trying to quit, all I do is sit there and think about cigarettes. Any advice?

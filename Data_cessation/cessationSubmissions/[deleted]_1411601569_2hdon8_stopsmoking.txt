Just over 3 weeks now.

I used to fret about cigs constantly early on in my quit. I'd check this sub-reddit hourly. Something occurred to me earlier when I had my first "craving" for the day; I woke up at 5am and didn't even -think- about cigarettes until right around 6pm. Well, that's one hell of an improvement from the constant yearning it used to be.

For what its worth, I can hardly even call them cravings anymore, its just a sort of "I used to do that" kind of thought / feeling. I'm fully confident, having come this far, that I'll never return to smoking.

For those of you struggling, it really does get easier. I remember I didn't believe it for awhile. My brain kept trying to convince me that I was some exception, that the withdrawal would -NEVER- go away, that I'd always be dying for a smoke. But I wanted to quit, smoking didn't even appeal to me anymore. So I stuck with it, and I'm glad I did.

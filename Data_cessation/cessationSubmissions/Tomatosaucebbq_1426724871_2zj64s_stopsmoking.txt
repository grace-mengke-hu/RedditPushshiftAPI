Two weeks in, feel really ill.

So I'm about two weeks in and I feel like utter crap, I can't sleep, the headaches have started, the coughing and constant popping... But I don't want to smoke and I haven't since my last one, bar the old habit craving that is easy to dismiss and my douche coworkers offering them to me to see if I break (I think they might have a bet going on or something, this just motivats me even more though.

How did you guys deal with the headaches and insomnia? I've heard coffee is bad but it's all I have left haha.

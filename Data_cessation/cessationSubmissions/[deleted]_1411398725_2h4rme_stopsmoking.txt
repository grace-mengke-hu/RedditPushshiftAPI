Third times the charm hopefully!

This will be my third time attempting to quit. I've made it over 2 months smoke free but something always happens where I say "f it!" 
I've lost over 50 pounds in the last year and have gotten really into nutrition/fitness/wellness...smoking doesn't really mesh well with all of that. I've realized smoking brings out all my bad habits. When I smoke, I drink, I eat shitty and I'm lazy. Vice versa. It's an endless circle of bad decisions. I live with smokers and that seems to be my biggest struggle. 
I feel mentally ready and glad this sub exists for support! 
Already requested a badge and downloaded one of the stop smoking apps. 
Any tips/suggestions for people living with smokers would be awesome.

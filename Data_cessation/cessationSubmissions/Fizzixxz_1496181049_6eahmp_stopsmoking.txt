Horrible acne since quitting!! Pls help

Hello I am on day 3 of quitting using a vaporizer with the lowest amount of nicotine I can find (3mg per bottle) after smoking for ten years, I am a 25 year old male. It was all going well until this morning when I woke up to HORRIBLE acne! I've never had more than one small zit or two at a time even through puberty when it's supposed to be worst. But these are a whole different story. It's mostly on the left side of my face, huge painful ones, my left side of my face looks swollen they're so huge.

 Is this "toxins" leaving my body or something? Has smoking been an acne suppressant this whole time? Is it the vaporizer? I used to vape and smoke at the same time, using vaping to smoke much less until I finally gave them up, but never had this problem so I doubt that's what's causing it. 

Either way I'm not going to start smoking again. I feel so much healthier and energized even after just three days. I'm already breathing better. Everything is doing much better even my cognitive functions it seems, except my poor face. ANY ADVICE IS WELCOME!! Thanks!

3 months quit in 2 days. Maybe great but this is where past quits have died.

Has anyone else here mastered the short quit only to fail the long quit repeatedly? How did you beat it? Feeling strong but I know what is coming. Any self analyzers experience this and have ideas why this is? Thanks in advance for your thoughts.

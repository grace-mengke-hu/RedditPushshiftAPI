How to stay smoke free around smokers

Hello!

I quit smoking a year ago and have had a pretty good go of it this time (4th time quitting). I think it's been so easy because I don't have friends or family who smoke near me. However, my SO and I are going to visit my family back home and my mother and aunt smoke. My younger brother may still smoke, but I'm not sure. Thankfully, they don't smoke inside the house, but they do smoke in the car and we'll be getting picked up from the airport by my mom.

I'm a bit nervous about picking it up while I'm there, even if it's just one (though is it ever really?), and would love some advice from people who have had to be around smokers while being a non-smoker. 

Any advice or kind words help! Thank you!

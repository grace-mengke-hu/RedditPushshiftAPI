I think I hit a personal mile stone

Just got back from Austin for the weekend. Was traveling with a bunch of college buddies for a guys trip. Drank all day and night, bar hopped, sat outside with other smokers on what would have been and ideal smoking opportunity. I had a few cravings but nothing crazy. Made it all weekend without any issues. Never though I could have done that. Very proud of myself. Stay strong my friends.

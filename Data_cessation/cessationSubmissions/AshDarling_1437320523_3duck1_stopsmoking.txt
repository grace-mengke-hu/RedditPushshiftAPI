New quitter :3

Hello loves.
I am new to quitting and thought I would share a bit of my story.
I am Ash. I will be 22 next month.
I have been smoking for 9 years.
I would smoke about 15 cigs a day.
Well I have quit.
I have been smoke free for 5 days now. 
I have quit cold turkey with no nicotine supplements or anything else. But mint gum and mints have become my bestfriend teehee. I was just curious as to how long the cravings and mood swings, and headaches would last. Thanks ahead for your time and answers :3
Much love, Ash.

It’s hard to shift the mindset of “I’m sacrificing something good that I enjoy by quitting” to “I’m stopping a terrible and unhealthy habit, and I will be better for stopping it.”

Most times I can easily tell myself that smoking is disgusting, and only making me sick. Despite being several months without, sometimes I still romanticize the feeling of smoking. 

Early on in quitting, I did smoke one cigarette. But I didn’t tell myself it was a relapse. I didn’t tell myself I failed, because I hated that cigarette. It was disgusting. I felt horribly sick from it. I stank. My mouth tasted horrible. And didn’t have one again. Instead of saying “man, I fucked up.” I said, “it’s okay. I didn’t ruin my progress. The hatred for that cigarette IS progress.” 

Now nearly a year on from that nasty little smoke, I find myself wanting the comfort that smoking brought me. I won’t lie, it’s really tough to remember why I quit some days, even when I write it all out all over again for myself. 

I guess I just needed to ramble about processing my quitting journey. I don’t know where I was even going with this, but thanks for reading my rambling if you did.

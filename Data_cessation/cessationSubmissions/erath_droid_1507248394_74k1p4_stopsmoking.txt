My lungs itch

Two months in (I think- haven't been keeping track to be honest) and my lungs just sort of.... itch. Like that feeling you get on a big scab when it's healing and you want to scratch it but know you shouldn't.

That and I'm feeling like I can't breathe from time to time and then I realize that it's because I'm not having to breathe as deep or as often as before because I'm getting more oxygen into my lungs with less work than before.

I'm certain it will level out over time, but it just feels so.... weird right now.

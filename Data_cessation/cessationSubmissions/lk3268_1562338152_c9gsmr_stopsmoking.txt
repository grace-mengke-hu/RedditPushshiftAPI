So disappointed!

So let me start with my backstory:

\-smoked for a long time.  quit for 5 years after reading Allen Carr's the easy way

\-had my first child.  i guess i had a hard time with the transition into motherhood and started smoking again when he was 4 months old.  He is now 2

\-tried reading the easy way again but just didn't work like the first time

I see a weekly therapist and had discussed a plan to quit 7/4/19.  Well I smoked my last cigarette last night, fully ready to stop.  This morning I woke up and just felt so sad and depressed (my son/husband are away and I have to work so I was alone).  What do I do?  I go buy a pack.  I'm so disappointed with myself.  This is now who i am.  I was always active and healthy.  Now i feel tired, gross, and unmotivated.  I want to be a hot mom!  The cigarettes don't fit into my life anymore but I just cant seem to kick it.  I know I just need to start.  Tomorrow?  Monday?  I don't know what to do... help!

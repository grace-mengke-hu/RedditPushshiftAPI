Nothing works

Things I've tried so far:
- Allen Carr's method to quit smoking
- NHS support group 
- Chantix (too many side effects)
- Zyban (too many side effects as well)
- cold turkey
- nicotine patches 
- vaping

They did not work.

When I say side effects I mean I couldn't walk from nausea and vomiting or dizziness so preventing me from going to work which is a massive issue.


Not sure what to do anymore?

Eep! Get back ye craving monster!

Day 18 or 19, and I’ve been going strong! But right now I am struggling with that feeling that I’m MISSING something!

I know it’s bs and it’s just the addiction talking, and that I’m recalibrating back to being normal and shrinking nicotine receptors. But DAMMIT! Where does it come from?

Had to write this down to articulate that thus winsome feeling is manifestation of a passing craving. And this is one day at a time and thinking about “forever” isn’t productive. And it’s an addiction and I have to starve the monster to win. Phew. Okay, feeling a little better. Lordy! 

Hoping you all have a beautiful smoke free day.

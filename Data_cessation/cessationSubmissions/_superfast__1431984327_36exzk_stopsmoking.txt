1 week!

As of 5 pm today I've done 7 days cigarette free. My 5th serious attempt at quitting and I finally have the right mindset to make it stick. 
Feels great so far. Sleeping better, breathing better, & smelling and tasting better. The first couple days were rough, but I made it over the hump and will never take another puff! Thanks everyone on this sub for sharing and supporting! It has made a huge difference

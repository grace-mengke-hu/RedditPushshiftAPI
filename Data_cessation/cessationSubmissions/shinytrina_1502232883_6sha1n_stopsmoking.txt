8 days a week

So here I am on day 8 and loving it.  

Today I went with a friend of mine who smokes and it never hit me how much I smoked until I saw her today and I was like oh thank god I am not like that anymore.  She drives and I don't have my license, hence why we were hanging out. Every time we stopped driving the first thing she did was get out and light up.  It didn't seem to matter if it was a 5 minute drive or over 30 minutes.  Please understand that I am not putting her down, I just couldn't get over it and never really noticed it until today.

Btw, not once with her smoking was I really tempted to light one up, so yay :)

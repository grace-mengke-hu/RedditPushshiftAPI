What a win ðŸ¤—

I found some smokes in the garage and after 10 minutes or so of talking to myself (inside my head lol) i put the cigs under running water until they fell apart.  I was so close to smoking JUST ONE. I even had one in my mouth at one point. I am super surprised and proud of myself today! 5 days nicotine free.

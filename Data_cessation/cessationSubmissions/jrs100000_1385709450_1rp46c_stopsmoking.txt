60 days of freedom

Its my 60 day quitting anniversary.  The cravings and mood swings have faded and my ability to concentrate in stressful situations is almost back to normal.  I have packed on a few pounds in the past couple months.  Now that my addiction is under control Im putting serious effort into exercise and diet.

I had forgotten how wonderful taste and smell could be, or how great it is to not worry about my next fix.  Sometimes it feels like Im just waking up for the first time in years.

I know that every one of you here can beat this addiction.  It may take some time, and it will certainly take some sacrifice, but it is the simplest thing in the world.  Just put down the nicotine and never pick it up again.

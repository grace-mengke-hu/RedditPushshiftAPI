Today is the day, I hope this community can help me stay on track!

I've been a smoker for 6 years now, and in the last couple months I got up to as many as 30 cigarettes a day. I've gotten to the point that a huge amount of my energy and thought goes exclusively to cigarettes; I'm almost perpetually stuck between wishing I didn't smoke and jonesing for my next cigarette. Never mind the physical drain of smoking itself: My breathing is shallow, my circulation is weak, my body aches, I can't keep focused, I'm wasting money, and I smell like shit. I'm sick of it. I've tried to quit before but I think unless I hold myself accountable to others I'll never succeed. That's what brought me here! I've been a lurker for a while now, and this seems like a fantastic community. I want you all to be a part of my process; even this message alone, knowing that it's been read and that somewhere out there I have people I don't want to let down, could make the difference for me. I've been ready for a clean, healthy life for a long time now, I want to get better. I can't wait any longer. And I hope you all can help me get where I need to be. In return I hope to give back whatever support I receive to people who feel the way I do now, hopefully with the strength and wisdom of all you successful non-smokers. I feel better already, I think this is first time I've said honestly how bad my habit is, and written out what smoking is doing to me. Anyhow sorry for the rambling I'm just excited and scared and all that, wish me luck, and I hope to get to know you all very soon!

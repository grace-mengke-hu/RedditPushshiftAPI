22 year old 3 weeks off cigarettes, feeling some cravings tonight.

I know it's a mental game. Trying some breathing exercises. I just really wanted a smoke tonight, but alas I know it is simply all in the mind. I don't want a cig. I don't want to die from smoking. If I can quit now successfully later on in my life i will thank myself for being strong and saving my life. Ive had these almost 'day-long' cravings almost. hard to explain. But it's a mental game. A game that I must and WILL win. 3 weeks no tobacco today. turning 23 next month. I never want a cigarette ever again. It will ultimately kill me. I don't want all the health issues with my lungs. Sorry for the rant guys. Let's all be strong and beat this mental game

4 year anniversary!

My wife pointed out today that it is my four year anniversary!  Man it gets easier, but damn.. I still have dreams where I picked up smoking again, and I get so disappointed in myself!  But then I wake up and realize I'm still good.  I couldn't have done it without lurking in here and reading all your stories.  It helps, it really does.

Thank you all.

I need to do this, and do it right for once

I am pretty young, and I'm smoking for a few years, it's been 3 or 4 years now I think. I promised to myself million times that I would quit, and everytime I found some reason to light one up. I want to become a better person. I have promised to my parents, my ex, myself in the first place that I will do it.

And I give in every time.

But I want to become better. I want to show people that I can be strong. I once succeeded for one month, and I can't remember now why did I gave in again.

I am sick of that.

This is my way of promising my family, my ex which I want to show I can get better, and most of all myself that I can do this. I am on my own in this, but I want to be strong for once.

Yesterday I had most pleasant cigarette with morning coffee. I want to remember that as the last one, meaningful and joyful, so once I'm again in that same situation I could think "huh, IT IS better without them".

Today is my official day one. Wish me luck guys.

Supporting my pregnant wife

She's been struggling stopping smoking, so I decided the best way to help her stop was by getting the smokes of out the house altogether. Yesterday was our first day of quitting, although we both cheated and had a couple of smokes.  
  
Today, though, I haven't had a smoke and I'm feeling pretty good. I get minor cravings every once in a while, but nothing major. I always said I was going to quit smoking when I turned 30, but 29 is close enough! 13 years of smoking ends now! :D  
  
When did the cravings get worse for you guys? I had a smoke yesterday after work and one before bed so I could sleep. No real cravings this morning and only minor ones this afternoon compared to yesterday. 
  
Edit: Huh, now the cravings have gone through the roof. Weird. Gunna power through. Got me a tin of Altoids. I'm guessing I'm probably going to be eating this whole damn tin pretty quickly ;)

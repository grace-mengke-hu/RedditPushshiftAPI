Slip up

So I had an extremely bad week, both work and personal life and ended up buying a pack. Every single one I smoked I regretted instantly, and everytime I went to throw the pack away I justified to myself that it would just be one more. I am now back to day 1 (more like hour 3) of quitting. For those of you who think that you can just do one or two, in the great words of Admiral Ackbar "ITS A TRAP!" Don't do it, you will regret it later.

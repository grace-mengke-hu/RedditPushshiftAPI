Last days are a little hard

First 10 days here the hardest. But it got easy over time. 20ish days were cake for me.
But the last 10 days are hell i don't know why. It was not as hard as the first 10 but nearly as hard.
I'm using some hard antibiotics i'm not sure if it has something to do with it.

Any suggestions and comments would be appreciated.

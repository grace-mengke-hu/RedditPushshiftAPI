Trying to quit in a relationship, when your partner still smokes - any advice?

Guys, I've only smoked for about 4 years, but I'm ready to quit. I've been able to stay smoke free for a few days at a time, but always relapse.  

The problem is that my girlfriend is a pretty heavy smoker (Marlboro 100s - almost a pack and a half a day!). We are both in our late thirties, but she has smoked since her teens, so at least 25 years. When we first met and started dating, we were both smokers, so I don't feel like I can just ask her to quit on my behalf. I also can't say anything to her while I still smoke with her, it feels very hypocritical. 

So typically, I don't hang out with her much during the week and I'm happily able to not smoke at all. But then the weekends come, we go out to a bar, or hang out, and every time she steps outside for a smoke, I'm tempted to join her - I just miss her company. And some times I'm able to go outside with her and not smoke, but other times I think "damn that looks good" and I end up smoking again.

But really, I'm sick of the smoking, I can't stand it. And I really fear for her health - Jesus, 25 years of nearly 2 packs a day... Scares the crap out of me. 

How do I stop smoking myself without resenting her for continuing to smoke? I have to quit for me, but how do I separate what I decide to do for my own health, versus her right to make her own choices over her health and her body? We have talked about this, and although she says she wants to quit, she is "not ready". I'm thinking she will probably never "be ready". 

Any of you that have been in the same boat? If this kind of question is inappropriate for this forum, I apologize. 

Thanks!

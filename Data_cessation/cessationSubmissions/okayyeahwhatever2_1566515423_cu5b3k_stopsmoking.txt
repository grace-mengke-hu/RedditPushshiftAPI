You know how some people worry about gaining weight when they quit smoking?

Well, I'm 5 months 12 days smoke free and in the last 2 months have lost 1st 2.5lbs!

I think its because I am more focused on a healthy lifestyle and have more love for my body now so I'm making better choices all round 👍

I'm proof that you don't have to gain weight when you quit smoking!

If I can do it, so can you!

Keep up the good work 😁

(thank you for listening to my not-very-humble-brag)

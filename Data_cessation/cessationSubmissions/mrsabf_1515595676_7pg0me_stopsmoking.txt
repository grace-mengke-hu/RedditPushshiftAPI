Quit date is on Saturday! Advice/tips?

I'd like to be 10 days smoke free by my birthday on the 23rd. What should I pick up for the first non-smoking weekend? Gum, candy, any good book recommendations? What helped you?

I do have an e-cig and nicotine gum, but am planning on not using them.

Thanks guys! I've been a lurker for a minute but have decided now is the time, I'm almost 28, and started when I was 18 so this year makes 10 YEARS :( definitely ready to be rid of it.

I am accountable. No more nicotine.

So, I have just passed the 2 week mark after being a pack a day man for good while. As with all my other quits it has been relatively easy compared to some of your stories. The physical addiction doesn’t do it for me despite being 20 years a smoker. It’s the mental side I guess.

Anyway just wanted to say hi to the internet strangers I’ve been lurking with and that I’m going to be accountable for my actions, for my health.

No more cigarettes.  No more stinking. No more coughing when I’m not “ill”, no more disturbing bank balances.

Not sure why I’m finally posting...just wanted to say hi I guess!

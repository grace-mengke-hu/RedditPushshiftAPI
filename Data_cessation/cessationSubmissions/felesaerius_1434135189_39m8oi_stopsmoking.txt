Is it unusual to fall into depression about a week in?

I'm trying to quit (yet again, I've stopped and started so many times in the past 2 years, it's frustrating). No vaping this time, just... quit cold turkey (tends to be the best way to eliminate cravings for me). However, I've noticed about a week in, I fall into a really bad depression, just... can't stop worrying about well, anything. Just wondering if it's unusual at all, and if not, how did you deal with it?

Ugh. Back to Day 1

I wish I hadn't smoked. It didn't even satisfy the craving that I thought it would. I got drunk and really should've known better. I guess I just wasn't strong enough in that moment. But I know better now. I'm just embarrassed that I have to reset my day 1 all over again. At least it was only 1. I won't let it become 2 cigarettes. Drunk as I may be, I know better than to ask for another. I feel ashamed, but a bit better prepared for the next time. I know I have to avoid this situation for awhile until cigarettes are farther into my rearview mirror. No more alcohol for awhile. It just makes the voice of addiction so loud and hard to ignore. I didn't think I'd have a craving that lasted for more than an hour before. It was just unbearable. But no excuses. Back to the drawing board. I can do this.

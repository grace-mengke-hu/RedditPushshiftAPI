6 days in and feeling great, thanks to everyone who posts and gives their first hand experiences

Well after 30 yrs smoking (im only 44yo)and many times trying to quit in the past I have finally put my mind to it and am not picking up another cig for as long as I live.   I always said I wiuld quit when they hit 1.00/pk. Then 2 etc.  then next thing i know its 30 yrs later and almost 6.00$/pk,  i have an 8 yo son who i dont want to smoke.  I still am in good health as i surf and take many trips annualy to surf large (10-15') waves,  run, bike etc but how much better could i have been without smoking!?   I had always said i will quit after next weekend cause there was a party or event in which i thought being able to smoke was relevant.  It has always been easier to not quit then quit.  To be honest I LOVE SMOKING AND I LOVE CIGARETTES!   We just cannot continue this relationship.   So last sunday i smoked my last one and went to bed telling myself that was it.   I have had very minimal wd symptoms and cravings.  I attribute this to the fact that i have made up my mind once and for all that i am done and my body agrees.   I am not doing the patch, vape, or chantix as in the past,  this is me against me and i am going to persevere. 
I have read other peoples posts about being over weight and worried about gaining more,  my doctor said he would rather see someone 100lbs over weight then smoke.  
I believe that you have to quit for yourself and really want to quit both mentally and physically.  
I just want to say thanks to whomever started this reddit sub.  Just reading other peoples stories is also giving me encouragement.  Congrats to everyone who is also on this journey.  We will make it !!!!

Thank you.

I started smoking about a 2 months ago when my friend offered me one when we were drinking. With his advice on "you won't get addicted the first time" I picked up the habit. 

I came here because I was disgusted with myself from smoking but I didn't know exactly how bad smoking was. After reading through some posts and how all of you are struggling with quitting, I took my pack and threw them away. Here's to me hoping I won't smoke another in my life.

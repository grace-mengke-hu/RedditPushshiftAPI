Replacing those idle moments of reflection...

I was just reading [this page of inspirational quotes on quitting](http://thequotesmaster.com/2015/12/660/), and this one made me realize one factor that may have been missing in my previous attempts to quit: 

 

**“Smokers, male and female, inject and excuse idleness in their lives every time they light a cigarette.”**

&amp;#x200B;

I think the quote is kinda harsh, but it made me think. I have always cherished those moments -- you know, those moments alone when you stop everything and stand aside to smoke. I have always used those moments to think about what I've done that day, what I need to get done, any current issues or problems that need solving, etc.  I've always seen that time (without even realizing it) as a moment to reflect on whatever's on my mind. It grounds me... relaxes me. When I don't have those moments, I feel overwhelmed and rushed.

So now I realize that I need to somehow replace the act of smoking in those moments with something else. Has anyone done this? I think it might really be key for me to quit successfully. Any ideas are greatly appreciated-- no matter how simple, complicated, sane, or cray-cray.

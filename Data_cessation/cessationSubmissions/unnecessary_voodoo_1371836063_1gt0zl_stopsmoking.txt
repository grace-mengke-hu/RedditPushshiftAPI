Smoked my last one an hour ago. Let's do this.

24yo female, been smoking for six years now. Around a pack a day. Finally made it through Allen Carr's book and couldn't even finish my last cig without an overwhelming sense of disgust and self-loathing. Concentrated on that feeling and hopefully realizing that it's not worth it will help me over the next few days of brutality. 

Quit cold turkey. This is my 6th or 7th quitting attempt and I've done gum, patches, e-cigs, wellbutrin and chantix. Nothing quite stuck, so it's balls to the wall now. 

EDIT: Thanks everyone for your input, even the dicknose at the end of the thread who told me I should smoke. Whatever, gotta learn how to deal with that too as a lot of my friends and family have seen me try to quit a few times and are less than supportive this time round. Day three hits at noon GMT today, and I'm doing okay :)

16 years old and been vaping for 10 months trying to quit, any good tips?

So I started vaping in February this year like a complete dumbass, Vapings been spreading across highschools like crazy and I hit my friends thinking eh probably wont get addicted but uh 10 months later and $600 gone I regret it greatly.

I threw away everything I had about a day and a half ago and have been feeling better. Any other tips to quit?

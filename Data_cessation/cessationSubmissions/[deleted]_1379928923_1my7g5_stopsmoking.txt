tips please

i have a set date for when i'm going to quit smoking. i'm not as confident as i should be about it, but it's about that time to cut this habit, and what a difficult habit it's going to be to cut. 

so i was hoping i could get as many helpful tips as possible. and by as many helpful tips as possible, i mean just that. PLEASE GIVE ME ALL THE TIPS YOUR FINGERS CAN POSSIBLY TYPE UNTIL THEY BLEED, THEN TYPE SOME MORE. 

thank you in advance. 

**edit:** sorry, i should've figured this is a repeat post. just a new reddit user being a dummy. i'm currently in the process of going through all search results for "tips" in this subreddit, but please continue to provide tips in case i missed them in my searches. the more the better!

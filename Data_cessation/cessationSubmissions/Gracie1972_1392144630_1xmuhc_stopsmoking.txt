Can't believe how little I even think of it.

I was always worried about being in agony having cravings for the rest of my life when I was a smoker.  Now that I'm at 170 days I go weeks without even thinking about how I smoked.  I haven't had a craving in a long time.  And when I did all I thought was this is better than craving it every half hour.

Alot of it is your mindset.  Don't obsess over cigarettes and you won't miss them as much.  If you haven't read it get Allen Carrs book.  Has great points about being a nonsmoker.  Even if you have quit it is worth reading. 

Being a nonsmoker is so much less stressful than being a smoker.  Always planning your next smoke...making sure you always have cigs and lighters.  I was even snowed in and didn't miss that feeling of panic when you can't make it to the store in case you run out.

I came on this subreddit every day for my first month.  I try to come back and offer my encouragement when I do think about it.  This community is awesome!

four months!

the last time i had a cigarette was just before my grandma's funeral in december.  i didn't decide to quit because of her, she never smoked and her death was just natural from old age.  i'm not even sure why i quit, to be honest, but i'm glad i did.  obviously not my first attempt.  the last time i quit it was soooo hard for me and even months and years after quitting, i still had intense, constant cravings.  the only thing that kept me from it was my parents because they hated to see me do it.  this time is much different.  i'm pretty sure i'm done with it.

So as of 2141 this evening I have decided to quit.

Was sitting outside and decided I had enough of an addiction to this stick. 

I've smoked since I was 13. I'm 27 now.  This is my umpteenth time quitting.  The previous ones were attempts. This, this time is going to be successful.  Any tips or tricks?

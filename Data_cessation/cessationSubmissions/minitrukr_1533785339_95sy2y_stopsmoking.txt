In the hospital with pneumonia and no smoking

I've made it 34 hours and I feel ready to just sneak out to my truck and smoke one. But smoking is the reason I got pneumonia in the first place (or apparently it made it more likely). Yet somehow even that doesn't feel like a good enough reason to stop. But I'm trying. I told them I don't want the patch. I'd rather sit here and be miserable because using the patch would only delay these feelings. 

But God damn do I want a fucking cigarette. I'm pissy, shaky and just not happy. I hope I can do this. I need to quit. I just needed to complain to people that could understand.

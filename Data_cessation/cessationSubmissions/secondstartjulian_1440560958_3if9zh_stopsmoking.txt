Started up again after a bad breakup

It was a breakup where I kept thinking we'd get back together. The anxiety over that truly killed me. It had been 3 years since I quit. I've been chain smoking since last Thursday.

It's finally over now, things with my ex I mean. Thank god. I quit smoking tomorrow.

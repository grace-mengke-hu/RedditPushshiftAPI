Freedom and true rebellion

The world as we know it is a staged affair. We are controlled by the few for profit. Think about anything that you do that profits somebody. Think about it with a suspicious mind. Do some research. The facts are not hidden. We have become so inured to conspiracy the we drown out the truth and laugh it off. 

Big tobacco wants you to smoke the cigarettes that kill you, because you are an addict their profits are secure. Big Pharma wants you to smoke too, because they will get their profit from you buying all their drugs as you die from the effects of the poison that you paid to put into your body. Do you think this toxic affair began when you had your first cigarette? It started the first time you were fed what is commonly and falsely known as "healthy food". Even our food supply is controlled and contorted into something that makes you sick and makes you less than you could be. All for profit. Rebellion as we are taught to understand it, is to eat whatever you (think you) want, to smoke, to drink, to do drugs, to scorn exercise and stay up all night. All of these things are exactly what the real power players want you to do. 

A true rebel will identify every addiction that has been designed to profit the untrustworthy curators of our reality and will then cast those addictions aside. Addictive food, addictive drink, addictive intoxicants, addictive cigarettes. Get rid of all of it. It's not just about health. It's about freedom. You are your own jailer. You have the key to your prison. Use it. Be a rebel. Be free .

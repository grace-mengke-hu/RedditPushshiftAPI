Day 40 now, do people still struggle with random cravings?

I'm not on Day 40, feeling pretty great and I feel comfortable in social situations without feeling the need to smoke.  
However, I have found recently that I will randomly wake up with huge cravings. Have other people found this? Does it pass?

Hey friends!

Just checking in. It’s been over a year since I was last here and I’m still smoking, more than ever. Im reading Allen Carr’s book for the 4th time and am really keen to make the jump out of this horrible trap. Any links, words of advice or support would be greatly appreciated. I can’t do this to myself anymore but I’m feeling terribly week..
My projected savings are $8.5k a year.
Stay awesome people!

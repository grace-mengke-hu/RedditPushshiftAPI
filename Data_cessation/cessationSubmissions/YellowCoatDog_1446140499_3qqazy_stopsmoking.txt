Tonight is my last night of smoking.

I'm 19 years old. I started smoking socially and, like others, I always said I'd only smoke when I was drunk. This escalated and, now that I'm at university, there's nothing stopping me. For the last few weeks (and, indeed, the months before), I've been smoking between five and ten cigarettes a day and I find it incredibly difficult to not smoke. Tonight, that changes. I've never had any self control, and have an incredible difficulty in committing to long challenges, though I've come to terms with the fact that I need to quit. I'm glad to have found this community, and hope you can wish me luck for the long road ahead.

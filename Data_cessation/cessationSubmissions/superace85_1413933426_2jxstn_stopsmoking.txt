It's been a failed day 1 quit for me. I still think I can do it.

Decided to stop smoking yesterday.  Today was supposed to be my day 1, but around lunch time I had a very intense craving, and it was all I could think about.  I caved and had 1 cigarette.  Then when I got home I had another.  Looks like my first day smoke free didn't work out.  But I'm not discouraged.  I know that having "just one" can be a slippery slope, and I'm well aware I can't get back into the habit of having 25 a day again.  I slipped up.  My first day in.  Shit.  

So, I'm going to try again tomorrow.  If I could get through with only 2 today, and really only had one INTENSE craving throughout the day, I am happy with progress.  At least I think it's progress.  I can't let my mind get the better of me here.  Thank you r/stopsmoking for the encouragement.  I hope to consider myself one of you soon.

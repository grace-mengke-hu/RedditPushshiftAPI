Decided to quit about eight hours ago. Haven't actually smoked since last night

I've done this before and I didn't stick with it but I woke up this morning with a hangover from booze and chain smoking cigarettes and couldn't face going out to the store to buy another pack or tasting smoke for fear of projectile vomiting.

I bought patches instead. For some reason the store only stocks Step 1, I'm guessing they don't usually get many return customers.

Last time I quit I switched to vaping and although it kept me off the cigs I came to the conclusion that it's no good in the long run - feels like it was messing with my body in some way but couldn't tell you specificaly how?

Mostly smoked roll your owns and so far so good, I'm alright on the patch today. See how this'll go.

Also, my very first Reddit post - do I get a free lollipop?

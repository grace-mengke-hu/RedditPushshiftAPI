I've been neglecting you guys a bit lately...

Hey guys, just thought I'd pop in to say thanks and offer some support for those still in the early stages of quitting. I'll have six months under my belt on the 19th, and I've never felt better in my life.

Seriously, it's amazing. Things taste better. Everything smells better. I can wash my hair and it still smells good a day later. My clothes are clean for once. I don't get out of breath walking up stairs.
I took up running when I quit smoking, I've never been able to run more than a couple miles without coming close to dying while I was smoking. On the second of June, I ran a half marathon in 1h48m. 

That was one my biggest accomplishments to date. But I wouldn't be able to do it without all the help I got, and some of the biggest inspirations was from you guys.

Thanks for all the words of wisdom and support. I know I'm not out of the woods yet, but I don't think I could go back to smoking now. I've come too far.


To everyone who's quitting, or thinking about doing it, it can be done. It's not easy, but you can do it, and you will not regret it one bit.

Best of luck to you all :)

Last cigarette smoked. Hopefully for longer than a week this time.

i've been smoking for about 2 years now and now feel its time to give up. None of my friends smoke so when I go out i tend to be the only one to take trips to the smoking area. So I've finished my last cigarette from the pack and aim to make it the last. After the first week I hope to have zero cravings (hope being the key word). Doing this cold turkey so reddit you are gonna be my only aid. Wish me luck!

THIS IS GOING TO BE BENEFICIAL.

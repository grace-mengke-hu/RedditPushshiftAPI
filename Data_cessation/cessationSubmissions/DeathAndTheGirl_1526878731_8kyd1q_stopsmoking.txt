2mos &amp; 2 weeks quit after 10 years. But - I've been sick this entire time.

I quit smoking when I got tonsillitis. I was sick for about a week, and didn't smoke that entire time. I simply chose not to start back up after.


Now,  shortly after getting well, I got a headcold. Lots of coughing. I assumed this was,"the smokers flu." I was sick about 3 weeks with this. 

Then the stomach flu. Then another head cold. A sinus infections. And today, I just woke up with another incredibly painful sore throat, fever, aches etc.

This can't possibly be related to quitting smoking over 2 months later, right? I'm wondering if there is a chance I have developed a sort of illness that smoking masked. 

I'm 100% committed to The Quit, but I'm trying to gauge if this is related or not.

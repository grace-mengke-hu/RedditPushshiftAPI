Having a hard moment

Just finding it hard not to smoke right now, I'm not going to but I thought writing a post here might help me through the moment a bit. I've been putting a lot of my life on hold for a long time and quitting smoking is part of a more fundamental change I am making. I'm a terrible procrastinator - right now I am finally dismantling my xmas tree, yup thats right, in April. I can't believe myself, thats probably why I want to smoke right now.

Thank you in advance for your support. Breathing and taking one moment, one step at a time

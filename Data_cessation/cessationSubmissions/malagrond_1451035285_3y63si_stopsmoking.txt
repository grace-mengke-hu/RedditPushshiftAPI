Need to stop smoking for next year, otherwise insurance goes up. Planning on quitting cold turkey new years day. Any advice?

Title, basically. I do have a few questions:

a) Are the withdrawals bad, particularly based on a half-pack/day habit for 3 years?  
b) If I smoke a single cigarette down the road, will it get me re-addicted?  
c) For those of you who have quit cold turkey, what did you do to stay focused on quitting?

I really appreciate any responses. Kinda scared of what might happen when I just stop smoking suddenly, but I know it's for the best.

EDIT: Thank you all for the responses! I guess I'm going to just have to brace myself for feeling shitty until the withdrawals stop. I do actually *want* to quit, primarily because of the constant cough and financial drain. Wish me luck, and Merry Christmas/Happy New Year!

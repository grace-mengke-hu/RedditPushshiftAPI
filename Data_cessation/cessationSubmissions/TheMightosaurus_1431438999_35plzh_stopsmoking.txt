I managed to quit cold turkey for around a week before caving in again. I'm going to do it this time, I'm on day 1 with using patches - any advice on using the patches would be great.

I just don't think I have the willpower to go cold turkey, at least this way - I can just have the nicotine for a while without the terrible side effects and reduce it after a few weeks. 

Any advice on helping the process go by smoothly would be great.

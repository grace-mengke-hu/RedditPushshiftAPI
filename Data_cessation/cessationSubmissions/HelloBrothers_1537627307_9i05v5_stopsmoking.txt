Keep up the good work everyone!

If you're browsing this sub you're already making progress in my eyes, regardless of whether or not you've actually stopped smoking. 

Quitting smoking is hard, but once you start it only gets easier. I look back on my year of not smoking and I was only counting days for the first 2.5-3 weeks. After that it was officially a part of my life, I was not a smoker anymore. Cigarettes were constantly on my mind however, and to anyone in those fledgling stages of their quit I applaud you and urge you to continue the quit!

I read the first few pages of Allan Carr's book and this was something that resonated with me. Cigarettes are a mental addiction. When you're awake you think you need a cigarette at regular intervals, every hour or so. Then why is it that you are able to sleep for 8 hours every night without waking up in regular intervals to smoke? Your body doesn't need the nicotine, you just think you need it. Just because it is mental doesn't make the quit any less easy though, and don't think you're weak if you falter and have to quit multiple times, I know I did. 

Please feel free to message me if you're having a hard time and want to talk! There are days when I just stop to think, "I am so happy I don't feel the urge to have a cigarette anymore." and I wouldn't trade that for anything.

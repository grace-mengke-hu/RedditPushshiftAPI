Wellbutrin/Bupropion

So I took my first Buproprion HCL pill, 150 SR this morning. I was just wondering who here takes it for quitting smoking? I was prescribed it by my primary care physician and after another week of anxiety, cravings and relapses I decided to go ahead with the treatment. 

So, has anyone taken it successfully? Anything I should be aware of or that you've experienced personally with it?  Like did it help with cravings and what not for cigs.

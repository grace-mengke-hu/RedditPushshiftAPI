Can't tell the difference between other cravings and nicotine cravings.

I just made a weird observation, I can't tell the difference between nicotine cravings and other cravings. For the first week it was pretty clear when I was thirsty and when I wanted to smoke. Now I seriously cannot tell. For example I was feeling queasy for the past hour or so and I thought I had an intense nicotine craving. But then I drank a whole bottle of water and it was instantly gone. This isn't the first time either. Yesterday the same happened when I couldn't tell the difference between hungry and nicotine craving. other instances include feeling dirty (I live on a tropical island, feel queasy if I dont take a shower every 12~14 hours), horny or tired. It seems like my brain has started associating any sort of craving to nicotine. 

This is almost funny.

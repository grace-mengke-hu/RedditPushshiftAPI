I am in an extremely dangerous place

For the last week, I have been having this dreadful thought, the sweet thinking of smoking another cigarrette. At first I accounted it to the fact that I was coming closer to 100 days smoke free. Now I have no clue of what is driving it inside me, but it is there.

This text is the last punch I can throw, and with every word I type comes the massive will to erase it all and go to the news stand, buy one single fucker and smoke it all the way out. I've kept a dirty ashtray to bring me back in times like this, but all I feel looking at it is a will to give it one more yellow butt.


I've had 2 smoking dreams this week, those in which you smoke, realize what you've done and feel shitty. Those dreams are not helping, I just wish I could somehow smoke today and just wake up the next day relieved it was a dream.

I've been off for a hundred days, first week is  the worst and I can certainly go through that again, the cravings after 1 cig are no match for me, I can take it!

I cannot, I must not, but I fucking want to...


PS: You are my last resort, I'm sorry if I sound like a whiny little bitch, but you're the only group I can turn to now

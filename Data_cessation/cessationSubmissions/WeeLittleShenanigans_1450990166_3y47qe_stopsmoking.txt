Substitution for morning coffee and cigarette?

This is the hardest trigger for me to break. My body is not "regular" in regards to bowel movements, to which my doctor has said that's just the way I am. My morning coffee and cigarette gets everything flowing but it's my last trigger. 

Has anyone found a gold substitution for this morning routine?

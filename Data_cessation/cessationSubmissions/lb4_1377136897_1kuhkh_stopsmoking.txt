What to expect from the lung cleaning process?

I've read a few different things about the process of the lungs cleaning themselves and I was hoping that some people here might be able to share their experiences or answer a couple questions. No post will go unread and any information you share is valuable to me. Thanks in advance!! :)

Here are a couple things that are on my mind as I go forward with the process. I realize that everyone is different but I'd like to understand a little bit more about some of the things that occur.

1. I'm currently working in a busy environment where I'm on my feet rushing around for 8 hours. Do you think that any sort of pain or need to be spitting all the time may make work a bit difficult.

2. I saw some people talking about lung pain. Is it typical to have pain so intense that you should consult a doctor?

3. Do you think smoking a nightly joint before bed will stop the lungs from cleansing themselves from cleaning themselves completely?

Thanks again!! :)

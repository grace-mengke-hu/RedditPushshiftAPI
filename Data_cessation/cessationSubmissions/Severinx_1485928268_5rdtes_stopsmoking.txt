Almost 2 years without cigarettes

I still crave cigarettes all the time. I just want to go to the corner store and buy a fresh pack. No one in my bloodline has had cancer that I know of. My grandpa who is 67 to this day smokes 3 packs of cigarettes a day and he is just fine besides an unrelated back condition.

I have a lot of other family that smokes. When I smell a cigarettes that someone is smoking, I get a strong urge to ask for one. I have not smoked a single cigarette in almost 2 years. I smoked for a total of about 6 years.

I keep getting these thoughts such as "it will be okay", "no one in the family has gotten cancer from smoking", "no one in the family even has a smoking related illness", etc.

The only reason why I have not started smoking again is because I am scared to death of getting COPD, Emphysema, or just straight up cancer. Is quitting 100% worth it?

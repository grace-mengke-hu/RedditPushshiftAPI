Falling off.

After a great year of staying of cigarettes, the year got worse. 

I started with a few puffs while drinking. I went to half a cigarette while drinking. I started smoking while drinking.

You can pretty much guess how it goes. Last night, the realisation hit me like a truck; all my effort I have smoked away.

All I can think of now is Alfred's line from the Dark Knight: "Why do we fall, sir? So that we can learn to pick ourselves up".

Time to kick it again.

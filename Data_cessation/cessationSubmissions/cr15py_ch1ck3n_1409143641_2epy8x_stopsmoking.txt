Step by Step or cold turkey?

My mother got diagnosed with cancer 3 years ago and eventhough she beat it with some kind of lasertherapy she didnt quit smoking. So yesterday I could convince her to try with me (also heavy smoker) we decided we want to quit drinking and reducing the daily 20+ cigarettes to 10 a day next week. Is it going to be easier to do it as we planned with reducing or quitting cold turkey?

I feel so stupid

So last night I was out at a party and had several drinks.  In my state, I decided to go buy a pack of smokes.  I had 3 before I passed out in bed and woke up this morning feeling like shit, partly cause of the hangover and mainly cause of what I did last night.  I am not saying that I had no control last night and I am not blaming it, just trying to put all the details out there.  So here I go again, starting at day 1.

2 weeks &amp; withdrawal symptoms

Just checking in after cold turkey quit on 10/4. Pretty consistently waking up at 4-5am and not able to go back to sleep (no trouble falling asleep by 10:30pm)...and night sweats, back of head and pillow wet.

Anyone else experience these symptoms this far into it? Will I ever get a normal 8 hours again?

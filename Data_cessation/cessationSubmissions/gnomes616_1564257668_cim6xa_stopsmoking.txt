Missed my 5 year quit-aversary

I was only reminded thanks to a Facebook memory that 5 years ago today, I was documenting my first few days having quit.

I still get cravings sometimes, but they are few and far between enough to be noticeable and rare events. 

I sleep better, I feel better, I smell better (both in smelling things, and how I smell to others). It's not embarrassing to have people get in my car. I don't have to excuse myself from social situations every x amount of time to go shave moments off my life.

To everyone struggling today, you can do it. Take a few moments to breathe deeply. Have a candy or a cookie or an ice cream. Take yourself out for a nice meal. Go for a walk. Those moments will pass, and before you know it, you'll be forgetting that you once tracked every moment of quitting, too.

App for quitting

Anyone know of some app that lets you put in your progress day by day? Like that you have to click in that you didn't smoke this day.

I know it sounds silly but I think that if I had something to look forward to when I get my cravings, thinking that if I make this I can put one more day in my non smoking calendar, then it would be easier for me to quit.

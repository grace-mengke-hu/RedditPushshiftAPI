Did any one else quit with gum?

I'm currently working on my 4th day of no cigarettes; my quit day was Monday. I am using the 2mg nicorette gum about 3-5 times a day. I'm curious if anyone else has used this method. The box instructs 1 piece every hour or two. This seems like a lot to me. I'm definitely not depriving myself, since its still so early. Whenever I get a big craving i have a piece but I try to ignore the little ones. My question is: If someone has quit with gum, did you do the whole recommended 12 weeks and however many a day the package told you to? Or have you been like me and just used it when you need it. I want to make sure I'm not hurting myself in the long run by not following the instructions. Thanks in advance.

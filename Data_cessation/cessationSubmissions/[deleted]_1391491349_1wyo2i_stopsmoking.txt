Almost at a week, urges keep getting stronger. I don't know what to do.

I read the easy way book, made it through my friend's 21st birthday party, and have almost reached the week mark...but the urges keep getting worse as time goes on. Felt nothing the first 3 days or so. What do you all think? Now I just subconsciously find myself looking at e-cigs or smokeless tobacco, even though I know nicotine is the real enemy here. Any advice is appreciated, because I'm going crazy here.

Let's do this.

I've smoked only 2 cigarettes in the past 6 days, and none for the past 3. I tried last summer to quit but only lasted 2 weeks, but I started again afterwards...

Now I have a girlfriend who hates that I smoke and I love her dearly, so there's another reason to quit. I'll be healthier, we'll both be happier.

It'll be tough with New Years with all the booze, but I hope I'll get through it! Merry Christmas everyone!

Day one.

I am so glad that this sub exists.  My husband and I have been planning on quitting for a month, and the day has arrived!  We gave away 3 packs of cigarettes to our smoking friends, put on our patches and are extremely commited to breaking this habit!

Been smoking for over 10 years, quit on and off due to pregnancy/pressured into by family.  This is the first time that I have actually WANTED to quit.  I feel really good about this!  I think it will stick this time!

My husband and I have taken smoking cessation courses before and have used patches before.  I have read all sorts of stuff my mom gives me about quitting (she quit 14 months ago) and she advised that I get onto a message board.  So here I am!

If anyone has any tips, please share!  I think I have some good ideas for fighting the cravings (walking, carrot sticks, craft projects, video games, gum) and staying away from my triggers (talking on the phone!) but any advice is welcome!

How do I maintain self control when I'm intoxicated and need a cigarette?

I smoke socially at bars, so maybe in a month I'll have 5-10 cigarettes which is still too much because any amount of cigarettes is bad in my mind. I'm just trying to get ahold of myself and maintain self control. It's just when I'm drinking a cigarette feels like my drunkness is elevated. It's like having another drink.

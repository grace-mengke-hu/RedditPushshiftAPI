Hello. Just quit

Just wanna say hi. 

I've been a smoker for 4 years. This is the second time I tried to stop. The first time I lasted three days and I quit as of 10 minutes ago. I smoked 10 to 30 a day. 

I'm in a new country where there isn't a smoking culture (from Ireland and moved to spain) so that will definitely make things easier. 

I'm also a regular binge drinker, but I've also quit very recently so that's gonna minimise my craving for smoking. 

Here's  my main problem: I like to read, drink wine and smoke cigarettes. I usually read philosophy books so I spend some time reading, then a few minutes thinking/smoking. I'd say this isn't an unheard of hobby, so can you give me a tip on how to just enjoy sitting and thinking? Sorry if that's a ridiculous request.

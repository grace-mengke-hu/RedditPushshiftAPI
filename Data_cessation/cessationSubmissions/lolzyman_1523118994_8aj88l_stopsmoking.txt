25 days in and dealing with the worst cravings

Today is the 25th day of my quit and this has been my longest ever. And honestly, its been an easy three weeks. A few cravings but all manageable till last night.

So yesterday being a Friday I had a couple of beers and when I got home I had the worst craving ever. I think mind games would describe the feeling better. If it wasn't late in the night with the shops closed I would have definitely got smokes. I cant blame it on the booze since I've been drinking since quitting and never had any serious craving like last night.

That was last night. I went to bed thinking it was a one time thing with the booze but I've been feeling like that the whole day today. It feels like I've already smoked last night and I just need to continue. It is all that's on my mind. I don't know how long I can handle this.

I don't know what happened. This whole time I had been thinking how lucky I was to have it so easy with the quit and this happens out of the blue.

3 months passed so fast

I rarely think about them. It's great how change happens. I had my doubts I could do this, but I feel I have the right set of mind now. Don't need no crutches, no matter how miserable my life is. Or I need them, but certainly cigars are not good crutches. They just add up to your pain and misery.

The thing that helps one is to try and try and try, until he/she succeeds. It's my 10+ quit I believe. But this time, I delved more into materials from whyquit.net in the first weeks. I felt as if my brain itself understood it was tricked into this chain smoking ad infinity. And I, myself, have understood, I'll be an addict for life and one ciggar will bring another 1828(that's how many I haven't smoked in 3 months and I didn't spend around 350 euro). 

Peace

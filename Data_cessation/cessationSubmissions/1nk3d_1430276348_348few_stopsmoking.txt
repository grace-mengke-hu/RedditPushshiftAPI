Smoker of almost 14 years, looking to quit soon, any advice?

I am going to be quitting soon, or as I say starting fresh air. I feel the mind reacts different when you put a positive spin on things.

I say I will be quitting soon, because mentally, I am not there. I want to ensure I have a successful quit, not like the previous ones.

With my job, it is hard to quit, I find myself smoking more because I am outside a lot.
Money has been tight, that is a motivator for me to quit, aside from the obvious ones.

I have called the quit line, and I have nicotine gum, I've been vaping using 0mg juice, to kind of fill the void, I just got a prescription for Welbutrin (sp?)

I've downloaded some books to read on breaks and outside to fill in the void to.

I've never smoked inside, so I got that going for me.

I've been trying to cut out my 'in between' smokes, and trying to smoke later than usual with my after dinner, before work smokes.

I feel I have a good plan, but I'm looking for advice, what worked? What didn't?

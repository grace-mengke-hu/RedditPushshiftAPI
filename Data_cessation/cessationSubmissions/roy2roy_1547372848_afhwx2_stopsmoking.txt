Knocking two addictions at once. Through hell or highwater right now.

Nicotine and weed. I know, "weed isn't addictive blahblah" it's mentally addictive let's not argue that point. On top of that I'm sick.

Been sitting at home, in bed, not leaving the house except for maybe a cup of coffee from starbucks and junk food to stave cravings. I'm finishing up day 3ish (caved on a few hits from my vape my first day but most of it was nic free). 

Coincidentally life threw some curve balls my way the day after I decided to quit nicotine and I've been sober from weed for around a week now. I'm mostly doing this just to see if I can. The longest time I was dependent on the both of those substances to either A) Get to sleep or B) basically survive day to day as a normal human

coming up on &gt;50 hours no nicotine right now and it's definitely still real tough.

Helping boyfriend to quit smoking, i want to make a care package

I have never been a smoker so I wanted input on my idea, my bf has been smoking for 6 years, he already has a vape pen so I wont buy him one but i know he likes candy a lot especially gummies. I wanted to make im a little pack full of candy and nicotine gum and patches. I also wanted to include  some cute notes about why its important to stop smoking. has anyone given or received a similar care package? And does anyone have any suggestions on how to help someone who wants to quit smoking.

My non-smoker manifesto

I'm not an ex-smoker, I'm not trying to quit. I am a non-smoker. I feel, think, and act like any non-smoker would. I do not reach for cigarettes when times get good, bad, stressful, or boring. The thought doesn't even cross my mind. As a non-smoker, I think smoking is for people with poor self control. It smells, and it is generally annoying.

I'm not sentimental for cigarettes, and do not romanticize them. Non-smokers do not miss out on anything, as smoking is nothing more than a nasty nicotine addiction that doesn't bring any value at all. Romanticizing cigarettes is the nicotine addict inside of me trying to find an excuse, any excuse, to smoke. Feeling good during a cigarette is only very short-lived, as nicotine levels drop quickly you start feeling bad again. As a non-smoker I feel this good all the time.

Smoking doesn't bring any value, while being a non-smoker has many benefits. Being healthy kicks ass, not smelling like an astray all the time rocks, not being a junky always thinking about the next fix is just the best, spending more time with family and friends is priceless.

I'm not an ex-smoker, I'm not trying to quit. I am a non-smoker. I feel, think, and act like any non-smoker would.

2017 New Year Resolution - One Year Quit!!! Check in here!

Hey guys. Tonight when the ball drops, I'll have made it an entire year without a cigarette!!!

Check in here if tonight is your anniversary!

Also, best of luck tonight for those quitting for the new year. You can do it! I quit cold turkey with just watching an hour webinar of Alan Carr's Easy Way To Quit Smoking. I've had minimum struggles and I don't even miss smoking.

           Stay strong, stay quit. ðŸ’ªðŸš­

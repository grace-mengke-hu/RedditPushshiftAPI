Quit smoking, still chewing gum. How to best wean myself off?

I find myself having addiction in a different (but much better) way.  I quit smoking about 7 months ago; however, I'm still chewing 4+ pieces of gum throughout the day.  


Like I said, I much prefer chewing gum to smoking; however, I'd prefer to be completely weaned off of nicotine.  I have had some problems since I quit smoking, mainly related to sleep, but the gum helps reduce the severity of these issues.  I have been continually reducing the dosage of the gum; however, I can't get over the last little hump. 

Anyway, just looking for someone who has been through this exact scenario before.  What worked for you?

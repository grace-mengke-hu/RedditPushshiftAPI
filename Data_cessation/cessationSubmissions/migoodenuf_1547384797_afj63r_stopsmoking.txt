Smoking is a time stealing. Regular smoker wastes roughly a day per month.

We are all here aware of the smoking drawbacks. Yet most of them are not instant. I mean smoking might cause health problems. Somewhen. You also spend money on cigarettes. Roughly 25$/mo where I live. Not much, right? But your time costs much more and you waste time right now. That's an instant smoking drawback I'm talking about. 

Do your own maths. Wasted time costs more than just money you spend on cigarettes or tobacco.

That was TL;DR and here's the story. Two months ago I started tracking time I spend on various projects and activities. Bit later I decided to track all the time that cigarettes steal from me including the time I require to purchase 'em and the time needed to reach the place where smoking is allowed. 

Say, one smokes 5-6 cigs a day. It’s almost half an hour per day that sums up in a whopping 15 hours a month. That’s a whole day just cut out of your life which is pretty short, by the way. Especially if you’re a smoker.

Of course one can pair having a cig with some other activity. Like staring at your phone but that will make this bad habit even stronger.

Why do you want to quit smoking?

First of all I love this community you guys seem very confident and I don't want to ruin that. But as a smoker for a couple years (19 years old) why quit?

Smoking makes me feel relaxed. It helps me forget all about my problems. Its my best friend.
And hey if it does kill me in 40 years then even better. I mean what am I going to do at 80 years old? 

I need my cigarettes because I love them. I plan to work for the tobacco company soon enough so I can help spread more love and less hate. Who's with me?

Trying to get my father (30 year smoker) to quit, what's the best way to go about it?

I figured I'd submit to this subreddit and hear about your experiences! I'm looking for a way to get my father to quit.

Short background: My dad never smokes in front of the rest of the family, it's always in the garage and if we're out of town, away from wherever we are. The entire family knows about his habit, he knows we know but yet I get the sense that he's ashamed, so I'm going to try and help him regardless of whether he wants to quit or not.

My dad's tried patches, (I found nicotine gum in his bathroom) and I think he switched to light cigs (I'm not a smoker, I have no idea whether that's supposed to help or not.) I was leaning towards buying him e-cigs for his birthday and see what he does with that. Even if it doesn't help with his addiction and he continues to smoke every day, at least the harmful chemicals in tobacco won't be assaulting his system regularly. I'd really appreciate ANY feedback!

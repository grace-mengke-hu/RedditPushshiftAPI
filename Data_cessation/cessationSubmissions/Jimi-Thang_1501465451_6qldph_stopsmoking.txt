Made it 2 weeks!!

In the 100+ times I've tried quitting, I've never been able to make it to 2 weeks. I am over the two week mark, and I'm done with cigarettes for good. I feel so good about my new smoke free life! I've already saved well over $100 dollars and not smoked almost 2 cartons. 

Sorry for my ramblings, but I'm so excited about this. I just had to tell someone!

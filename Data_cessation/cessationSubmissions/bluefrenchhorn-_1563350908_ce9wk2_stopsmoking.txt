Quitting smoking with a vape, help!

Iâ€™m 26 days in without a cigarette! Although I have replaced my nasty habit for another ( a Vype) I have slowly been lowering my dosage of nicotine in the pods. I went to the store to day to buy one with 0% but found out itâ€™s not a thing ðŸ˜©
Iâ€™m hoping it wonâ€™t be as hard to quit the vape, itâ€™s mostly with my morning coffee Iâ€™m worried about, that was my favourite cigarette of the day!

Has anyone else gone through this? Any advice would be helpful and appreciated!

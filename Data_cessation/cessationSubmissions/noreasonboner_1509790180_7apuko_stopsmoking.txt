Want to quit but can't seem to...

I bum cigarettes at work, and then I'll buy a pack, smoke it over time, and then the next day feel gross and buy another pack, smoke a few out of it, and throw the entire pack away. Then the cycle repeats itself. Any tips? I'm open to ideas. In my head I keep telling myself to juts stop buying them but then I bum at work. I'm going nuts. Help.

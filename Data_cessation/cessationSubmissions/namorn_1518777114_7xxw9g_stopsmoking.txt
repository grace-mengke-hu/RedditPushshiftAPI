Will smoking one single cigarette a week do any real damage to me?

If I smoke just a single cigarette on Friday nights, will this small amount actually do any damage to me? 

I feel like it is safe to smoke only one a week.

At my peak I'd smoke around 4 cigs a day, but I haven't smoked for about 6 months now. However I broke my streak and smoked a cigarette several days ago, and then bought a pack and smoked three in a row last night. My lungs hurt right now.

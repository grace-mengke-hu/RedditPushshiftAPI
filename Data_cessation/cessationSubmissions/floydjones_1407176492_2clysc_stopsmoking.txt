I almost succumbed this weekend

I was having a particularly stressful weekend, I took a shot of whiskey and asked to bum a cigarette, I had the light to my face and then I thought about it. 198 days down the drain just for this? Chances are I wouldn't feel any better afterwards, so I said no and gave the cig back. 

My point is don't fool yourself, don't do this to yourself it is possible to quit! I don't know any of you guys but I know that you can do this. Whether you're one day free, or 5 years I believe in you even if you don't believe in yourself!

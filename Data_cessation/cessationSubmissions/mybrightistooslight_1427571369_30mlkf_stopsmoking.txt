Do you have to smoke to use the Allen Carr method?

My boyfriend has already stopped smoking but we also ordered Allen Carr's Easy Way before realizing that Allen says to keep smoking while reading it. Is there a lot of content in the book that will still help him despite the fact that he's already had his last cigarette?

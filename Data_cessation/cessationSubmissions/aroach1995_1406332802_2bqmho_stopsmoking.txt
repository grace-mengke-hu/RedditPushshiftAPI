My mom just quit smoking after 30 years.

I am 19, and I am about to leave for college this Fall. I have been begging my mom, who is now 50 years old, to quit smoking since I have known how horrible it is.

Last Monday, I noticed that I had not seen her with a cigarette all day, and she usually smokes a pack of that Smoker's Choice crap every day. She was into Basic Menthol Light 100s when I was a kid. Then, times became tougher and she "down-graded" to save money. 

Cigarettes have always made me want to stay away from her. I haven't hugged her in years. I have not kissed my mom since I was like 3 years old. I verbally abused her because of it, and I kind of hated her...but...it got better. Let me explain more.

She smoked her teeth out of her skull and caused herself other problems. Thankfully, she has never had a near-death experience (such as a heart attack) due to it.

So, finally, this is how she quit smoking:

Last Monday, I noticed that my mom had not had a cigarette in her mouth/hand all day. I didn't want to talk to her about what I noticed because I thought that it would be best to leave her alone. She may have been irritable. Also, she has gone without cigarettes before due to not being able to afford them, but I knew she had money this time because she went grocery shopping that day. So she had to be quitting.

I left to go stay with friends out of town for a few days while my little brother stayed home, and, when I got back, I still didn't see her with a cigarette. I asked my brother if Mom had smoked while I was gone; he told me the answer was No. He also told me that my mom got rid of her ash trays.

So, just by having will power for the first time in her 30 years of smoking, she quit smoking. It may have been 5 days of hell for her, but it will most definitely give her bliss from here on out.

This is the best going-away-to-college gift I could possibly ask for. I just hope she stays off of it.

1 Week Clean and crazy itchiness

I have stopped smoking for a week now and feel pretty good. Had a couple of major temptations and managed to handle it, I really feel this time will be the one that sticks. Having said that, Ive noticed a horrible itchy/tingly feeling all over my body (worst of it is in my hands). I put it down to quitting and the blood finally circulating through my body properly for the first time in 7 years, or perhaps its anxiety from quitting, who knows. Has anyone else here experienced this, and if so, how long did it last, and any tips for dealing with it? Its driving me crazy!

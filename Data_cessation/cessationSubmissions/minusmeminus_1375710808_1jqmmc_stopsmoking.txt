I havent had a smoke in 2 weeks

So I quit cold turkey two weeks ago. A guy i work with who i take allot of smoke breaks was out the first week. Then the 2nd week i was on vacation so i figured it would be a good time. It hasn't been to bad a couple times i wanted to shoot someone but been pretty good. Today I came to work and he asked me to go out for a butt. I said i quit smoking so he went out on his own. I'm sitting at my desk right now ready to loose my god damn mind lol Any suggestions lol.

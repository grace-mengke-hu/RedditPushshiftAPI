VERY light smoker quitting with nicotine patches?

Hey all. I’m a 10 year smoker who used the patches, successfully quit for almost 2 years, then started again because I though I’d try the gum as a nootropic, which led to smoking when drinking, when led to smoking daily.

This post is about my significant other (“SO”). SO smokes spliffs only. It ends up being 2 to 3 cigs a day on weekends, and 1 cig in the evening on weeknights. It’s not that much, but SO has been doing this for 10 years. 

I’m quitting tomorrow and I got SO and I patches— 2 boxes of the step 2 and 1 box of the step 3, each. 

We’re concerned that SO will development MORE of a dependency on nicotine because the amount of cigs smoked is so low compared to me, but we’re using the same dose of patches.

Thoughts? Should the lower-level smoker do a step 3 *only* for 6 weeks or so? Or do the whole program and proscribed, since it is for “less than 10 cigs a day” smokers?

When will my concentration come back?

I quit smoking by using a vape for a couple of weeks and am now on my 7th day of absolutely no nicotine whatsoever!!! things are improving but my head still has the same foggy and confused feeling as I had on day 2. I know some things take longer to get back to normal and I know this is the nicotine receptors trying to play tricks on me, but how much longer is this going to last?? Is it normal for the mental symptoms to keep going for over a week? I keep spacing out and losing my focus on even the smallest tasks!

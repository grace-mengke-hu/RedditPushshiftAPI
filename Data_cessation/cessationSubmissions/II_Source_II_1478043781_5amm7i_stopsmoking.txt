Just smoked my last cigarette

Hi guys!

So around May of 2015 I started smoking whenever I drank, which is quite often as I'm Irish. I kept this lifestyle for a while and stopped exercising and eating well and over the course of a year I gained about 2 1/2 stone. 2 months ago I moved away from home and started smoking full time (about 10-15 a day). I turned 21 last week and had a hard look at myself.

I used to be one of the most athletic people I knew. Now I'm not sure if I could run a 5k because I havn't even attempted to run since the summer. I'm sick of looking at myself in the mirror. I'm sick of feeling lazy and tired all the time. I'm sick of smelling awful all the time. I'm sick of yellow teeth. I want to be able to play sports again with my friends and be able to outrun them. And I will!

This is the first day of the rest of my life (as cliche as that sounds). I'm so inspired and excited reading through posts on this subreddit. I want to make it this time. I really do. Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated.

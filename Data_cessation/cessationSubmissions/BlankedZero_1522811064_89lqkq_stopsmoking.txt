I just can't seem to make it

I'm furious with myself honestly. I spent 12 weeks on nicotine patches, I had no issues, maybe the odd craving but all in all it was easy, I finished the 12 weeks. Even mastered the art of drinking and not smoking, training 4 to 5 times a week, read EASYWAY for the third time and it made perfect sense again.

And then I finished the patches, and the cravings came back worse then ever, but I powered through, kept on training, kept on doing my thing. Then I injured my knee and couldn't train anymore, midterms came on and a million things stressed the fuck out of me. One night, I had a little too much to drink and bought a pack and started again.

And since I don't seem to be able to get more than 3 days without having a smoke. Granted i'm smoking a pack a week instead of one a day. But I have no doubts that if I keep going i'll be there again.

I legitimately don't know how to quit. There's nothing I want more, but these fucking cravings kill me everytime.

Sorry for the long post, I had to rant a little. Does anyone have any advice??

In 10 days, I will be smoke free for ONE YEAR!

I don't like to brag about things, but this is a HUGE deal for me. I smoked cigarettes for 16 years, near the end of it I was almost smoking one pack a day!

Vaping helped. Decreased the nicotine a month in, and the next month I just stopped the vaping. I did try a couple of puffs around October and vomited uncontrollably, that was the moment I knew I was just done with it for good. Haven't looked back since.

I do admit that when I smell some random on the street smoking I either hate the smell and it causes a slight headache or I end up craving it a bit... but I just ignore it and find a healthy distraction.

Quitting is never easy. Don't let anyone force you to quit or put yourself down for not quitting. It will happen when it happens. 

I wish all you smokers the best!!!!!

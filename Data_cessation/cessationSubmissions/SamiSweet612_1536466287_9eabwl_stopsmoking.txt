Here I Go Again

Tried many times before. Longest I've made it was 8 months about 3 years ago. Quit a handful of times since but only made it a few weeks or a month. 

Fingers crossed that this is the final quit for me!!! This subreddit has helped a lot each time so I'm going to try to stay engaged here again. 

I got this. I'm excited to be done with the nasty cough and congestion. Glad to know I won't need to run out and stand in the cold this winter. I look forward to having spare cash to be used on something I actually enjoy and love.

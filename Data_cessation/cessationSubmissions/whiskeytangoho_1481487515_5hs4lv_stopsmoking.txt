Quitting today

I've been smoking on and off for the last three years, more on than off by now. I've tried to quit and succeeded for up to a month but I always come back to it - too many of my friends are smokers, only when I drink, the usual - it just doesn't work for me to limit tobacco usage. 

I just went out and bought a full pack after not smoking all day. I smoked one and it tasted like shit, I just can't do this to myself anymore. But I smoke hash occasionally, and I'm looking for herbal alternatives to rolling tobacco for it. I'd just like to be nicotine-free. 

I'm posting here to remind myself and come back to this post next time I have a craving. I also don't want to talk about it with my friends because I've done this whole I'm-quitting-for-good thing way too many times. Any support would be very very welcome.

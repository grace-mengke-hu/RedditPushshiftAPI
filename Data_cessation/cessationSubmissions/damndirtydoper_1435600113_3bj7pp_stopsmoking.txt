Going Strong!

I was in a situation over the weekend where I was drinking alcohol and was the only person out of my friends who was not smoking. It was difficult, and I even asked for one (My dude called me an idiot and said no) but I did not have a cigarette. I feel like a true non-smoker. I've been working out three days a week and I feel fantastic. This sub has helped, so have my friends, and allen carr. 

Now send me all the love. PM's even. just kidding....no im not....please reassure me. Im desperate for pats on the back.

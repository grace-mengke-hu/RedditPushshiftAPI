Best way to help someone quit?

My mom is going to quit smoking this Sunday as she will have a few days off of work. What are the most helpful resources to help her quit? What can I do to make it easier on her?

I've never smoked myself so I don't really understand how she is feeling. We picked out some patches and gum already. Any other suggestions?

I really want this to stick for my mom as she is a life long smoker and I'm worried for her health. 

Thanks in advance.

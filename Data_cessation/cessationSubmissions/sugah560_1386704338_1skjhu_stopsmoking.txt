Not the preferred way to quit on this sub, but it's working for me. 2 days and counting.

I've tried a multitude of ways to quit with little to no success. I've switched to a vaporizer and I think I've found my groove. I know there are potential health risks to this, but I can't imagine it being anywhere near as damaging as smoking.

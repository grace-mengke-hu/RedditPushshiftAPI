The smoking dreams are back.

For three nights in a row I have had very vivid dreams about smoking.  I can taste them, feel the burn in the back of my throat, and the nicotine running through my body.  But worse than these feelings is the feeling of resignation that I feel, like, "oh well, if you can't beat'em, join'em".  It is a feeling that I have felt before when I have tried to quit and failed.  I wake up in a slight panic thinking that all I have gone through to quit was for nothing.  Then I  rub my eyes, pour some coffee and smile when I remember that I AM beating it and it wasn't for nothing.  Stay strong everybody.

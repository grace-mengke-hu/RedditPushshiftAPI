Patches or cold turkey?

I have used patches in the past to quit (lasted about 75 days) before my life went to shit and I used cigs as an awful, no-good, not-even-helping crutch. I now have been smoking again for about a month and it's time to quit again.

I don't have much money for patches (or for cigs, for that matter), but I am willing to spend the money since they have been helpful to me in the past.

Do you advocate for the patch or gum or for a cold-turkey method?  And yes, I have Allen Carr's book and am reading it currently :)

Thank you in advance!

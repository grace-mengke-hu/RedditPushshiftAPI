4 days smoke free and struggling

Im 4 days with no smoking and I'm really struggling with the withdrawal! Any suggestions please?! I've got awful headaches and just feel so short tempered and agitated. Having a hard time keeping up with regular tasks today. I really feel this is the time for me to quit so I really want to stick it out. Please share anything that  has helped you in your success. Many thanks.

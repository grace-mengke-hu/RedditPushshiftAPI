Should i decide a date?

Quitting seems scaey for me because i have mild agression problems and dopamine from cigs have helped me. I'm 18 years old, started smoking when i was 14 and lonely to get some friends, big mistake. I smoke about 20-27 cigarrettes a day, sometimes 15-20 if i dont have a lot of stress or anger on me. I have noticed already that i get exhausted more easier, mornings i cough like hell sometimes, the amount of money i put on it is like huuge. I also think its a huge turn off as it comes to dating.

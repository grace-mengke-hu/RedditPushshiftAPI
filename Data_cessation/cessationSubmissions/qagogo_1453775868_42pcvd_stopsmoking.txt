One month in, feeling grateful and relieved. How do you feel?

The last few days have been the hardest, filled with weird, random stress. Tonight, for about a half an hour, I thought that  I had totally, completely, and irrevocably fucked up a project at work, the first one of a series that earned me a big title change and raise last month! I thought I was going to get fired. I was so terrified I almost threw up. In this half-hour window, I could have bought cigarettes with no one knowing. The feeling of imagined relief from the first drag came to mind, but I beat it down. After what felt like my entire life, I figured out the problem, which was not as bad as I thought, and fixed it before deadline. If I'd bought a pack and smoked, I wouldn't have been able to do that.
Not smoking is not always easy, but I am so grateful that I've been able to come this far and stayed strong tonight. How do I feel about being a non-smoker for the rest of my life? Scared but relieved. Free. Strong. Thankful. 
What about you? How do you feel?

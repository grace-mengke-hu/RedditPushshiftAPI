7 months, my key to quitting

I smoked a pack a day since I was 16, now 34. I moved to NYC 7 months ago from LA and they are $10 a fucking pack here. I've smoked one here and there when out at a bar but have completely given up the habit and havent bought a pack. Maybe it was the entire new environment, maybe all my triggers are gone (i no longer drive for one) but I tried for so long and couldn't, and then just stopped without even batting an eye when I moved. I never even craved one. But I can smell a smoker from a mile away, and they STINK. Good luck everyone.

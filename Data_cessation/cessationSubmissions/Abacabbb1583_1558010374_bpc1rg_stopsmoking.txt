Only 3 days without a smoke, but...

Just a little vent here...In these 3 days, my anxiety has dropped immensely, my workout routine is starting to feel like a healthy tired and not a "YOUR SOUL IS MINE/ I'M DYING" tired, and I have saved close to $40.  Oddly enough, I have become addicted (ironic) to making my car smell as good as possible.  All of the air fresheners I stocked up on are finally being put to long term use and not just constantly trying to mask a recurrent smell of burnt cigarette purgatory.

After 8 years of ~20 cigs a day, it's time to STOP.

Greetings breakers,
I've been a passive observer of this subreddit for the last year. I've been try to quit many times and this summer I managed to stay without cigarettes for 10 days but I've started back again. I guess writing here it's going to help me because after so many of you quitted I don't want to let any of you down and I want to prove myself capable of doing this.
Sorry for the terrible english.
Have a nice nicotine free day everyone, here we go :S

Insomnia on day 12

First off, my bandage has not been reset, i know.

Im currently on day 12 and have no trubble with cravings unlike past attempts. Also unlike past attempts im also having to deal with insomnia still, which normaly faded away after 3 days. Not having had a good sleep in 12 days makes me slowly loose my mind. I quit cold turkey and I'm 20 with no medical conditions and i'm also very athletic. Any idea why i have it, or even better how i get rid of it?

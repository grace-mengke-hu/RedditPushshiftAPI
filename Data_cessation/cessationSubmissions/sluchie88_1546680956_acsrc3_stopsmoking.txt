Day 00 - I'm good at convincing myself to quit, horrible at convincing myself to stay with it

I'm sure this is an old story here. I've never been a heavy smoker, about 5 cigs a day. Sometimes more, sometimes less. I know I should quit and I really want to. I go through the process of throwing out all my cigs, knowing that I can do it. Then a day, a week, or even a few hours later a craving hits and I crave.

I know to identify my triggers and avoid them. I know to change my habits, but I just... cave and smoke for a week or two, then I go through the process of quitting.

Without rambling further, does anyone have advice on how to stay quit for longer than a few days?

As a new nonsmoker, I bought some Reddit Gold

I can NOT believe that I am ACTUALLY ABLE to afford Reddit Gold now! I can not believe this. It all seems like a dream that I am not "permitted" to actually wake up from somehow. Glad I am not allowed to wake up, cuz GOD KNOWS I don't want to be "back there" (smoking).

This was my treat for not smoking at ALL AND passing the Trial By Fire Superboss stage without dying at all!

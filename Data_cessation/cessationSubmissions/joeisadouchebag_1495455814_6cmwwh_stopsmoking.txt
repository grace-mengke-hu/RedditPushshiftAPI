Day 5 -- First day going to work

The 5 days have been pretty hell, but I do feel pretty good right now. I'm scared though that going to work is going to spur a lot of really strong cravings that I've yet to encounter or learn to deal with. Any advice or experiences that might help me through the day without convincing myself that "just one" will be fine today?

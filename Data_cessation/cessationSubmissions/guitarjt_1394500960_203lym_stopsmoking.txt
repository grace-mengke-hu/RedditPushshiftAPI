Anyone else that likes to drink but trying to quit smoking?

I quit a few years ago, and had about two years smoke free. But I moved to a new city where smoking is very acceptable and eventually gave in. I never did go back to smoking all day everyday, but I smoke when I drink. I want to kick it but am having trouble. How did you get through my situation. I know it's all in my mind, so tell me what you told/tell yourself?

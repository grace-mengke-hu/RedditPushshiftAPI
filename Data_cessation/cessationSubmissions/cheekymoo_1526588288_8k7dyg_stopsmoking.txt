Quitting smoking and heart attacks?

Hey guys,

I’ve been smoking for about two and a half years and, for the past year, I’ve been a pretty heavy smoker.

I really, really want to quit. It’s disgusting and I hate it but my paranoid mind has made me afraid of one thing in particular - heart attacks post-quitting.

While the evidence is anecdotal, on plenty of cardiac health forums are people who have had heart attacks shortly after quitting smoking and nearly all of them put the blame on quitting cold turkey not long before the event.

Does anyone know of any sources that can totally disprove this? It’s got me quite downhearted about quitting.

Sorry if this seems silly.

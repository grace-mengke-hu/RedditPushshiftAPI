Came THIS close today to smoking again.

Started seeing a girl that smokes, and I don't mind being around it (if anything it reminds me of how gross it is and annoying it is to go outside very five minutes, I just stay inside), but today I had my car towed after spending the night with her. She lit up while we were driving and I just felt so helpless and upset about my car (lost my job as well), so I'm unemployed, and had to shell out my last paycheck on getting my car back instead of paying off some bills on Friday. I just kept thinking that it's been 52 days, and that I only wanted the instant gratification, but that even then it was false; because nicotine was already out of my body. But damn I was close.

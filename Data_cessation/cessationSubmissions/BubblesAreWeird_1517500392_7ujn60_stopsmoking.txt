Here's to 6 months

I wish there was a better way to celebrate this mile stone, but this is still better. I remember reading posts that said they've completed one month, two months, and so on and I've always wondered if I could do it too, well today I hope this post inspires someone that they too can do what they might've thought was the impossible!

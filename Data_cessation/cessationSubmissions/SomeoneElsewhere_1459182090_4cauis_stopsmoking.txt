Fuck it. Going cold turkey.

I have tried almost every method out there, and just have not been able to let the smokes go. I lit up today before even thinking about it. So, at Noon today, I quit cigarettes for the rest of my life! One hour and 40 minutes to go. This actually feels more powerful than patches and vape felt to me. :)

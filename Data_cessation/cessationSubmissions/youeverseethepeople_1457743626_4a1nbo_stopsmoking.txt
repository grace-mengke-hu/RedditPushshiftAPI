Quitting Smoking with the Help of This App

My husband is quitting smoking this year using this app: [Craving to Quit](https://www.cravingtoquit.com/). I found it in another sub, and I thought I'd share it here, if that's okay with you guys. 

He's attempted to quit many times in the past, and it seems pretty helpful thus far, and features a 21 day program using current knowledge about addiction in the brain and guided mindfulness techniques.  Posting it here in case it helps any of you too. :)

almost 3 months!

just checking in. i just realized that i'm almost 3 months into not smoking, and i feel freaking AMAZING! just like the last time i checked in. i just wanted to thank everyone in this subreddit for being so supportive. i've had a few close calls (including being in a car with more than 1 smoker while they've been smoking *and oh god did i want one SO FREAKING BAD!!!*), but lurking here has definitely helped me (i've even recommended this community to a friend who's trying to quit, and who doesn't go on reddit at all). so thanks. and heres to the rest of our lives! and to those trying to hold strong, you can do it!!!! never give up hope!!

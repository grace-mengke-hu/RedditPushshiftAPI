I quit cigs 2 and a half weeks ago by vaping and today I kinda had a breakdown and a breakthrough at the same time.

I recently purchased a vape and some nicotine ejuice and slowly weaned myself down from smoking 30 12 mg cigs down to 4 mg, the last pack of 30 lasted me 5 days. 

So I’ve been completely cigarette free for 5 days , using my vape with 3mg e-juice and I was doing fine I thought. Then someone said something to me that just triggered me and I completely lost the plot, every tiny problem I had all came out at once, I’m embarrassed to say i was calling my self a piece of shit, punching myself ect, then my house mate came in to see if I was alright , I told them that I’ve been on edge cause of quitting and the 3mgs just isn’t doing it’s job, they talked me out of my mini psychosis and said they will go buy me smokes, that’s when the Breakthrough happened, even in my defeated, self hating moment of weakness I said “ no I am fine I think I can do this” and I suddenly felt good about myself and proud of myself (a very strange feeling for me). 

I still have a long way to go but I have to admit, excluding this episode I feel great, my cough is pretty much gone, I can taste things ( got a stop eating soo much onion, never knew how long the taste lasts lol) and I just feel better about myself. 

I just gotta keep preserving and I should be able to defeat this demon.

Reset my badge :(

After 6 days of being nicotine free, I  caved. had a few drinks with friends and ended the night with a cigarette. I felt guilty and ashamed, but i smoked it none the less.  I have tried quitting before, and usually when i cave once, I quickly give up and spiral back to smoking.
not this time!  i reset my badge but 1 cigarette will not break me. time to start again. thanks again /r/stopsmoking, this would be a lot harder without you guys

Need to quit before too late

So I recently went to rehab for opiates. I was not a cig smoker going in but gradually became one because everyone there smomed and I am impulsive.

Essentially for the last two weeks I have had 2-3 cigs a day (reg parliaments). I have a nervous system issue so any negative imbalance (such as nicotine withdrawal) causes strange cramps and symptoms.

I want to quit before I am dug in deep. I smoked a marlboro gold (light) yesterday. Waited 24 hrs into today and had an ultra light. Plan to wait another 24 hrs and have half an ultra light. Then another 24 and have a quarter.. then jump off cold  Is this logical or no (assuming I can stay on course)?

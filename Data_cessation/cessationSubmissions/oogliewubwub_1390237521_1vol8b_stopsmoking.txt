Rant regarding bitchy non-smoking friend

I have a friend that is SUCH a bitch about smokers.  She makes comments every single day about how "Smokers are ruining my life" and "Gah, don't they know how terrible it is and why do they DO that" and all sorts of judgments regarding smoking, etc...
I'm trying REALLY HARD to bite my tongue and not rip off her head. What would you say to her?  I did send her a link about how hard it is to quit, why it is so easy to get hooked and mentioned that being kind and supportive towards smokers is probably a kinder way to go than to just accuse them of killing her.
Honestly, I'm *thisclose* to buying a pack just to blow smoke in her face. She is THAT annoying.

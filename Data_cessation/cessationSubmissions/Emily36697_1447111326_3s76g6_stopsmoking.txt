Day 5....

Encouraging to read everyones story! I'm on day 5! I'm hopeful, I had a mini stroke at the age of 34, five days ago! It was scary and its because I chose to smoke. I chose to live with high blood pressure to smoke, its just ridiculous! My BP has been perfect for the last 4 days. Im using gum and a low dose disposable ecig. I purchased an app for $3.99 (less than a pack of smokes). I love seeing my daily progress, it helps a lot! It's all about accountability and it has daily mission activities. Today's activity was to join this site and describe my journey! Congrats to all of us for making a choice for ourselves, a choice to be health. Cigarettes are one of the hardest addictions to beat, but we can do it because we are worth it!!!!

23 Days Quit Lying to Myself

After 32 years of smoking, including the last 11 years of pills, lozenges, patches, and pods, 23 days ago I finally decided to stop lying to myself and quit cold turkey.  Best thing I've ever done.  Now I feel like I can conquer anything.  The first week was rough.  But pretty smooth sailing since then.  The key I think is to reject the lies and keep the commitment.  Not another puff, no matter what.  It's that simple.  Wish I'd done this 20 years ago.

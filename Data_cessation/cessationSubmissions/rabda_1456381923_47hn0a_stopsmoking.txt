2 months wow

I waited and waited to post the 2 months post. Here it is. 
In the last 2 weeks, things with quitting got even easier. I think less and less about it. BUT a new kind of craving appeared. Especially in the weekend. My whole being is set to not quitting. The idea of smoking seems absurd. The last argument is the real non smoking folks' life, who never smoked: how do they handle boredom and anxieties and worries? They handle those by doing something useful or fun, and smoking is neither of those. Keep up the quit, it's the most liberating stuff, I've done.

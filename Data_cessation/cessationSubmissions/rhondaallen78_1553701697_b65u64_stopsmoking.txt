Day 4 quit

After a dozen failed attempts. I have strung along 4 days in a row, the longest in 5 months. I quit for 3 months but had a major relapse!! So since then I’ve tried to quit again. I am using the nicotine patch and that takes the physical withdraw away.  I don’t ever want to do that first day again... it was the hardest day for me. 

I wish everyone success in their journey to being smoke free.

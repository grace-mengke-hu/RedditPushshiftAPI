I miss the heat from taking a drag

I had my last cigarette yesterday morning, so I'm at approximately 36 hours sans nicotine at this point, after smoking daily for about 29 years. I'm using an e-cigarette (filled with no-nicotine, peppermint-flavored "juice") as a substitute for when I feel the urge to have a smoke. Honestly, I don't feel like I miss the actual nicotine very much - it's been a very, very long time since I got an actual "rush" from smoking.

What I *do* miss is the feeling of super-heated air hitting the back of my throat when taking a drag off a cig. I'm guessing that I'm probably not the only person to miss this particular sensation, but I do find it interesting and a bit odd.

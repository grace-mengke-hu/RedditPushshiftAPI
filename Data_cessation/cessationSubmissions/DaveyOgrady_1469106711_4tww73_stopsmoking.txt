Quitting today, again.

Hey small corner of Reddit.

I am quitting smoking for the millionth time.  I've done it before for over a year, but also have about 15 years of smoking in me.  I really want and need to go without cigarettes anymore again, I remember how much better I felt.  I also worried about my imminent demise less, and felt much less ashamed of myself.

I am just waking up and am gonna make some coffee and walk the dog.  Wish me luck, I just wanted to share and have a smidgen of accountability.

Thanks for listening new friends.

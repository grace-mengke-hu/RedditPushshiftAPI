A year and a half

Hey all, I was doing a little counting and I realized that today is my year and a half anniversary of kicking the habit and I just wanted to stop by and encourage all of you. Quitting smoking was the single hardest thing I have ever done in my life hands down. I smoked a pack a day for seven years which I know in comparison to some isn't all that long but for me it was enough time wasted. 
As I come up to my year and a half I realize something wonderful, I don't think about smoking anymore in the context of cravings, zero percent. I am excited because this is something that I truly never thought would happen when I was in the trenches with this thing and crawling out of my skin in withdrawals. I also have a new found sense of pride and self-confidence. If I can stop smoking cold turkey what else can I do?
I know how difficult it is guys and girls, I really do. I Just wanted to stop by and tell you that it does get better and soon you won't have a single craving for a smoke. You will be a non-smoker. 

Things that helped me: Alan Carr's "Easy Way to Stop Smoking", cold showers, avoiding alcohol, crying like a little baby, talking to former smokers, and most importantly reading success stories on r/stopsmoking.

I wish the best of luck to all of you and I hope you all find the strength to fight for your literal life one day at a time.

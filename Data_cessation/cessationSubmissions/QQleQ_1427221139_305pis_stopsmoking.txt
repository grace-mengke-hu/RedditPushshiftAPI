2 days in..

I finally pulled the plug. After 20 years I was getting sick of the economical side of smoking and after I ran out on sundaymorning I decided to be a nonsmoker from now on. 

The weird thing is.. Even though it's incredibly hard.. It's making me more dizzy than anything else. I get these weird dizziness attacks which I think are cravings but I'm not too sure..

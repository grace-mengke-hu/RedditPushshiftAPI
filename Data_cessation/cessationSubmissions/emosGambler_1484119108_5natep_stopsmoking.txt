Checking my status. You can do it too!

A while ago I wrote [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/5f53qf/i_feel_pathetic/). And today I just wanted to check my status. I'm 45 days non-smoker - not even 1 cig! You all guys can do it, no matter how weak you feel right now.

Don't smoke today, it is not good. The real life is beginning while not smoking :)

I finally quit after 27 years

My wife and I both smoked a pack of Marlboro each day; I for 27 years, her for 13 years. We told ourselves that when we quit smoking we would use the money we were spending on cigarettes to buy ourselves something nice. Anyway, here's a picture of our new SUV: http://i.imgur.com/yidzM7V.jpg. Yeah, A FRIGGIN' SUV! The car payment and full-coverage insurance payment is still less than what we were spending on cigarettes. I can't believe how much money we were spending over the years to slowly kill ourselves.

So this is day two for me. What should I expect moving forward?

I guess I'm looking for like maybe a day by day of the first week or two, idk really.

Yesterday was my first day without a smoke in God only knows how long.  Smoked the last one in my pack Monday evening and was going to go buy more yesterday but decided "screw it." Yesterday wasn't a problem at all but tonight has been a little rough. 

When are the cravings the worst? I'm guessing probably somewhere in the 3-5 day range?

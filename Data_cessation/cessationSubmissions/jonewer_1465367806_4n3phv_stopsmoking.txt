Short of breath after stopping?

So I haven't actually smoked a cigarette for almost a year now, though I have beeen vaping.

I stopped vaping last Saturday night and have been using nicotine lozenges since then.

This morning I went for a run and really struggled to find my breath. I was around an extra 30secs per km which is pretty depressing as I have a race on Sunday.

Doea anyone know what causes this shortness of breath post quitting and how long it lasts? I know its not just me that experiences it as a google search shows it to be a common problem.

Thanks!

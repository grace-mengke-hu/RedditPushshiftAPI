Almost full week but...

I have made it to 6 1/2 days but instead of getting easier it is getting harder. I find myself in a weird funk/depression that i have never had before. I am super happy all the time so this is very odd to me and hard to deal with. Has anyone else experienced this and how did you deal with it. Thanks!

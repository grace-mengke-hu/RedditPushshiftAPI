Help, please

I currently have 4 months and 23 days tobacco-free and I'm so close to caving right now. 

My SO left three unopened packs in my car by accident. He lives two hours away and I don't know when I'm going to see him again so I just have these cigarettes. I was going to mail them to him but apparently that's illegal. 


The cravings are so intense and I don't know what to do with these packs. We're both too broke for me to throw them away. I have to rely on my willpower and I don't know if I can do it.

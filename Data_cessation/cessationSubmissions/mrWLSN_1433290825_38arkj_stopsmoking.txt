Hit triple digits today. 100 days!

[From the Australian My Quit Buddy app.](http://i.imgur.com/6yhM3nK.jpg)

This is my first post on here, but I've been lurking for quite a while, and it was posts and comments on here that convinced me to make the jump and tell myself that "I can do this." I could do it, and I have.

I was never a "pack-a-day" smoker, but averaged 10 or so a day. I knew I had an addiction because even though I got to a point that I hated myself for smoking, I still did it.
I quit cold turkey 100 days ago, knowing it would be tough but knowing what I wanted more out of quitting:

* Be healthier
* Spend less money
* Have a greater chance at finding a partner

I contemplated gum or patches, but read that it was going to prolong my nicotine addiction recovery. It was the best decision I made.

I almost broke in the first week, but I told myself "you want this," "you don't NEED to smoke." It has powered me through everything.

Today I celebrate 100 days with a special lunch on the birthday of my partner of almost 3 months - who I am very happy with. I had the money to get her a really good present as well. I will then go to the gym for an hour or so after work.

I have friends and family that tell me that they are proud of me - something I never really heard for years. I feel and look healthier than I have in years. And I am happy, more confident with myself.

I know that I don't want to go back.

To anyone that might be me from 100 days ago, looking on here for that inspiration to finally quit - you can do it. It'll be one of the best decisions you'll ever make for yourself. It can - and most likely will - be a struggle in the beginning. But it is so worth it.

Thanks for reading.

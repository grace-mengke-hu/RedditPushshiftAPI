Quitting must be hard

This is my second day smoke free and I have been teeth grinding, white knuckling and headache all day which I have accepted as nicotine withdrawal. The thing is I only smoked for 6 months not even 5 a day I am grateful but can't imagine how hard it would be to have smoked a pack a day for years and quit. Nicotine is one hell of a drug.

For those of you who have quit you have my respect. Because you have done it there is no excuse for me to not do the same.

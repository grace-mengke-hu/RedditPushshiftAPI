A little advice please

So Iâ€™m 19 days smoke free and feeling good, I have been smoking for 30 years, this is the first time I have taken it seriously, I am on patches and on the highest one 25 mg as was smoking 30 a day, when do you think I should reduce my dose, I really want to kick this, and all your amazing posts there must be someone out there who could help.

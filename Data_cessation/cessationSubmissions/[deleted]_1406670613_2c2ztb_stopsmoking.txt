Quit date is in two days - Motivation? Advice? for quitting in stressful times

23 year old here who has been smoking for 5 years 1/2 a pack to a pack a day. Smoking has robbed me of my physical and mental health. 

I have developed gum disease, I have bronchitis on and off throughout the year and my manic depression has been exacerbated by my habit. 

I HAVE to quit because I'm getting a deep cleaning (root planing and scaling) of my teeth in two days to treat my gum disease. The last thing I want to do is to keep smoking so it will come back. 

Any advice on meditations, self affirmations or any method you used in the final days leading up to your quit date?

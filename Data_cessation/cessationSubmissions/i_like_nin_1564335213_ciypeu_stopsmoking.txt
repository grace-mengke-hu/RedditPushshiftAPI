Help me!

Please tell me this gets better! I am 18 hours in on my first ever attempt to quit after smoking 19 years. I'm all over the place emotionally. Yesterday evening, I felt so brave but now my mental state has devolved into me crying over my lunch telling my husband that I'm a pathetic loser. I am *trying* to do the Carr Easyway method, but I'm beginning to feel like I missed something. He writes about not moping and being ecstatic from the jump. I'm trying to force those positive thoughts. But that's just it, they are forced. My natural occurring thoughts are, "good god, I feel like I'm going crazy. I may actually HAVE to smoke." This withdrawal is intense, even if it is just psychological. I feel lost. I'm scatterbrained. I'm exhausted. My husband thinks I'm putting myself through unnecessary torture. He quit basically overnight with no issues using Chantix. He calls it the "magic pill." He wants me to take it, but I'm anxious about it. I'm deep breathing, cycling, blowing bubbles, playing games, going for walks, etc. It hasn't even been 24 hours. How the hell am I going to do this?

No work happy hour tonight for this guy.

We had a happy hour tonight after work. I skipped. Didn't go. For some reason, it didn't feel right. There are couple smokers in a group and I was afraid that I would fold and bum a smoke. I rather not risk it. It's not worth it. 

I feel pretty strong these days, but still want to be 1000000000% sure that I would be totally fine.

Just got home, drinking my pre-workout...gonna go downstairs and going to lift things up and put them down!

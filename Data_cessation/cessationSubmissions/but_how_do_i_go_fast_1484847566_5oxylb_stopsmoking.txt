Had some second hand smoke being blown in my face last night...

After a meeting, we were locking up late. The other fellow that was helping with dishes and locking up wanted to chat for a while. We stood outside in the cold, while he pulled a cigarette case out and lit up. The wind must have liked me this night, as it didn't matter what way I turned, the wind was right there in my face.

While the second hand smoked came in through my nostrils, filling my lungs, and causing my addict mind to fire not-forgotten-synapses every which way, I felt something weird for the first time in the last ten years. I felt the cilia in my throat being effected! 

This may be my imagination playing a trick on me, yet the sensation of something in my throat being effected by this second hand smoking would not and could not go away. I am happy to have given up the 10 year old habit. I am happy to be clean and sober today. Thank you all for always helping with this!

how to say goodbye?

I want to quit, i really do. When i try the feelings of loneliness, anxiety and discomfort start to arise within me. I tell myself they arent good for me. Thousands of articles and scientific evidence has proven that its linked to a host of life threatening diseases that could be preventable if i put them down, but its hard to say goodbye to such a close friend.

I guess thats why i always come back to cigarettes because even if its depleting my energy levels, it has always been there for me through the good times and bad times.

looking back, i never thought i would become so dependent on cigarettes, i was a big fitness junkie years ago, and flash forward now where the first thing i do in the morning is wake up and light up a cigarette. 

i realize im throwing away money, and this is a very unhealthy and costly relationship that has consumed me to my inner core, but this friend has always been there for me, and i don't know how to say goodbye?

Want to stop smoking, got a new job!!!

I recently got offered a great job that pays about 40&amp;#37; more than my current job. I'm due to start in two weeks and this is more of a white\-collar office type of job. I plan on quitting smoking and getting my life back on track. I was wondering if I make the switch to Nicotine gum will it leave a smell in my breath/clothes.

3 days in, doing well

Well, I never thought I would post here but after making it through the first 72 hours I thought I might as well.  Got drunk Monday watching football and smoked WAY too many cigs.  Woke up Tuesday feeling like absolute shit and just decided to quit.  I don't have any cravings, withdrawal isn't bad (minor flu-like symptoms and aches so far), huh.  I smoked on/off for 15 years, average of a half pack a day except for drinking nights which would be easily a pack a night.  Used to chew as well but candy helped me off that shit.  I read about 80 pages of Alan Carr's book, must've been enough because this is easy so far.  I don't even think about smoking anymore.  I was never a very dedicated smoker but it's pretty crazy to go from using nicotine all waking hours of life to none in a matter of months.  If I can do it, you can too.  Get some!

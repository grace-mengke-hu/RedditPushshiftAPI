Has anyone here cured erectile dysfunction by quitting?

I know this is very personal but I could really use some feedback. Amongst other possible lifestyle choices ,were any of you able to reverse e.d by quitting cigarettes?

 Some background is that I'm failing miserably at quitting. The most I manage is to cut down(even that fluctuates). I have been seeing a doctor and he thinks the e.d is from the abilify I take. Which very well may be true. But I still get occasional chest pains and heart palpitations. I know that is reason enough to quit but I am weak to temptation and I am surrounded by smokers in home and in my friend circle alongside that i have serious depressive emotions I deal with. (It is no excuse but the truth of why this is so hard for me)

I have moderate-severe erectile dysfunction and I know these cases don't have the best outlook. I am only 27 but have been smoking for 13 years now. I know this coupled with the bad eating I had indulged in for certain years alongside my psych meds may render me hopeless. I'm willing to try and keep quitting. I know I have to quit because the problem is at least potentially likely to get less severe . And It can also hopefully help the Cialis work better (I still haven't picked it up yet so I don't know how effective that will be either )

I'm going to see a cardiologist to find out if I have already done severe damage to my cardiovascular system. Til then I just want to see if anyone here can mention any hopeful personal experiences.  

Thank you

It's been one year today yay! I'm so freaking proud of myself.

I still have to fight wanting to light up when the "perfect opportunity" presents itself. I remember googling in the beginning 'when will this urge will go away? One month.. One year? 10 years?' I don't think I will ever completely not want to smoke. I have encouraged others to stop smoking. I talk to other quitters. All this has helped cement how much I hated being a smoker. If I started to smoke again, that feeling of relief may only last 5 seconds but the self loathing will last much much longer.

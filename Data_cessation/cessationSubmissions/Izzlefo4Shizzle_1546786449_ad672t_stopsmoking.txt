4th quit attempt in 2 years

Started my quit journey February 2017....managed 6 months and have had several scattered attempts since then...all no longer than a month. Finally decided I was no longer going to quit quitting this year (using my snobby non-smoker ex as bittersweet motivation) and have been going strong for the last 3 days and 4 hours. However Ive noticed a completely different physical effect this time. On my last big quit attempt I felt better physically almost immediately it was more psychological. This time its the other way round. I feel physically ill....constant headache (mild) and one major thing today is that I havent been able to stop bringing up phlegm (sorry). Is this "quitters flu"? I dont actually have a cold or being sick....just those symptoms listed above. Any advice or tips on what this could be and how I could alleviate it?! Thanks ðŸ˜€.

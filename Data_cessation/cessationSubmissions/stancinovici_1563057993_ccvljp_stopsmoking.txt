I'm lurking this subreddit for a few years now and I'm finally ready to give it a shot. Why there are not any links to resources in the subs description? Can you help me with some advice?

Holla! 24M, smoking at 15yo. It's not my first try at stopping this stupid habbit. The longest streak was 2 weeks, of you don't count the fact that i smoked IQOS for a year. 3/4 of a pack a day. I have a friend that will be my support because she doesn't smoke.

Can you help? Hit me with your best advice and info please. 

My game plan rn is:
Getting paycheck.
Buy some nicotine patches.
Buy lots of snacks.
Meditate.
When the urge is hard smoke some IQOS.
Reduce the amount of nicotine in my patches.

Succes?

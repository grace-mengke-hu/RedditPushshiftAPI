How to manage cigarette urges during stressful work

It's been 2 weeks since I've stopped smoking. I've barely even thought about it aside from the fleeting urges out of habit here and there.

I'm really stressed out from work right now though. I need to come through with work (graphic artist so i really have to squeeze the creative juices) while being late on the deadline already. I'm feeling a lot of pressure right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the past, I used to smoke on stressful situations to help me pull through. Now I'm just stumped feeling really uncomfortable and an odd deadbeat mood.

Any advice on how to manage?

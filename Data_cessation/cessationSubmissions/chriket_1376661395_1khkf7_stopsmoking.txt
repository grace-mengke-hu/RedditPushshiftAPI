Day 4 and really struggling

Last night I found out that my boyfriend is being deployed (not sure when or where yet). My mom reminded me this morning that it's the anniversary of my grandmother's death (my grandmother actually raised me, so when she passed it was like losing my mother). On top of it all, apparently the added stress of quitting smoking has made my hormones go bonkers so shark week came a week early. All I want to do is smoke.

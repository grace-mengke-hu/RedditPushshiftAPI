Venting

My counter isn't correct. Do I even have a counter? 

I started smoking when I was 14 years old. I was in Croatia with friends and we met these guys. We played volleyball all day and had a good time. Until this new guy came up who smoked. He introduced me to cigarettes and I didn't say no. I remember falling off the chair and almost passing out smoking my first cigarette. But it was cool and so I ignored it. My friends also found it very funny to see me almost passing out. Since this holiday I was hooked. 

I kept smoking cigarettes stealing money from my parents. I thought of quitting every once in a while but never managed to go beyond a week. I tried it so fucking often. Maybe I just don't have enough willpower idk what's wrong there. Its like I tell myself almost every day tomorrow I'll quit but I don't. 

I think I'm even allergic to cigarettes. Whenever I smoke I become very short of breath and my hands become shaky. Now I really wonder why I would do that to myself for almost 10 years. Its insane. I won't tell anyone that I'm trying to quit now. I'll just avoid people as much as possible because the withdrawals make me a horrible person to be around. The next week will just suck. But I can no longer do this shit to myself.

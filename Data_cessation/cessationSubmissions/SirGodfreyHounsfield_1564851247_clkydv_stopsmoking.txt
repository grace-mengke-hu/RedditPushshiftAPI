After three days in a row not smoking one cig, I've lip two ones today.

And yes, I feel bad, but I simply just mark it as a day that I smoked. I don't punish myself or think the worst things about how weak I am and I advice you to also not self-punish yourselves. Just keep trying!

It's still a step forwards because it was really hard to cut my cig comsumption down to one a day. Think of your achievements instead of your faults.

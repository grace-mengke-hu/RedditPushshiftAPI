I can get past physical cravings, but the psychological always gets me around day 3-4.

Over the last 6 weeks I have attempted to quit many times. I've even managed to not smoke at all the last couple of weekends. But what gets me is my weekday mornings. I do not know how to start my work-day at the office without a cigarette in the morning. Life just seems way more dull without cigarettes. I can quit cold turkey for 3-4 days but the warm glow of a cigarette before work always invites me back.

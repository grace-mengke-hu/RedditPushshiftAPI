It starts today! (hopefully)

So i've been on/off smoking for a while and always used the fact i've stopped before as a reason I can do it again. Recently though my coughing has become noticeably worse and I haven't been great for money atm yet still pay £15 or so a week on cigs which could go to much better use.

I've been mulling over swimming more for months but been put off by the mere £5 a members fee. Today after being tired just walking up a set of stairs and having a particularly bad sleep after waking up coughing a few times i've decided to just stop cold turkey and use the new money i'll have to join my local gym. 

Hopefully it won't be worse than other times but for some reason I have a feeling it will as I just feel i need them more than I have in the past.

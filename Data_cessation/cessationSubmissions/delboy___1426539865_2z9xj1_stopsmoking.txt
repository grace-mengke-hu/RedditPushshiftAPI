One month today

Hey guys, today marks one month for me. I used Allen Carr's easyway and can't recommend it enough. The only time I've had any kind of craving was when I've been drunk. 
I've had three big nights out in the month and the first I went out with two non-smokers and 1 smoker and all night my brain kept saying just ask him for one cigarette! I made it through.
The second night out was not so bad until I was in the taxi on the way home and you know that feeling of when you're going home you have no smokes so instead of being in control and myself saying I'm not smoking because I don't want to, my brain was saying if you go home with no smokes you're not smoking because you can't! So I even stopped at a petrol station, went in and was discussing which brands he had and then, something inside my head just said you will regret this tomorrow, let's just leave it. And I did.
Last night was night 3 and in the taxi, had a similar experience but instead of stopping for cigarettes I discussed my quitting experience with the taxi driver. He said he was desperate to quit and I gave him details of Allen Carr's Easyway. It was easy not to smoke last night because I thought I bet this guy wishes he was stopped one month. He said they were killing him, which we all know they do! 
Anyway, just thought I'd share my experiences from month 1. Here's to month two!

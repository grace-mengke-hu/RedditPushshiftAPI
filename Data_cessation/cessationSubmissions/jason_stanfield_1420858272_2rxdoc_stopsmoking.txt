Day nine, and I'm not handling this well.

It's not just the physical withdrawal, but emotionally I'm wrecked. I feel depressed, helpless, weak, and scared - I'm all alone and don't really have anyone to turn to locally. My brain wants to shut down, but I'm restless.

I can't figure out if this is the withdrawal, or if all this has been there all along and smoking just "treated" it, directly or indirectly. 

Or is there something else going on, and I chose a shit time to dump a coping mechanism?

I'm going to see this through, of course, but I'm not sure who I am right now.  

**Edit** - Thanks, guys. Feeling much better now. Glad to know I'm not alone in feeling these things.

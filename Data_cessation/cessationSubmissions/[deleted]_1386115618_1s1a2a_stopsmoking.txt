almost a week without a smoke and decided today to give up the e-cig

I had my last Wednesday night and Thursday I bought an e-cig to help me quit. Today I decided that I want to completely give up the nicotine and not prolong the addiction. The worst part of all of this is that a few years back I had quit cold turkey for around a year and fell for the old "I'll just have one, I can handle it" sigh. Oh well I'm looking to the future

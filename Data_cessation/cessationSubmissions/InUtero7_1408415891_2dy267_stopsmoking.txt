Smoke Free for 6 Days

Hey I'm normally a lurker except in Zelda/Gaming subreddits but I figured I would stop by for advice here. 

I have quit numerous times which is, of course, the reason I'm here. I have trouble staying away and have usually started back up.  

I started smoking when I was 15 years old in 2006 when I started High School. I'm almost 23 and I finally said this has to fucking stop. 

It's been almost 7 days and I feel confident so far but I'm scared I'll relapse which has happened way too many fucking times.  

I haven't enjoyed it for about 4-5 years except the one or three that got me smoking again and then im filled with self-hatred, coughing, and spending 7 bucks a day on misery. 

My grandpa died from smoking related issues. My (long time) girlfriend's grandparents both died from smoking. My step dad had two smoking caused heart attacks and is blessed to have survived. 

Tl; dr

Any and all advice to stay away from smoking for good is appreciated.

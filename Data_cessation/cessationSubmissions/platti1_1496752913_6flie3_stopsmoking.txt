Day 2

Hello! I'm on day 2 and I've got a couple of questions. Is it normal to feel very tired during the whole quit smoking process? Yesterday I slept almost all day long, today I also had to go to bed before lunch and slept 3 more hours. 

Also, I'm very very angry all the time. The whole process doesn't feel good to me. I have cravings constantly and it does not stop. I feel restless, don't know what to do and can't concentrate. All the things Allen Carr said I wouldn't have but I do.

Do you have any advice for this situation?

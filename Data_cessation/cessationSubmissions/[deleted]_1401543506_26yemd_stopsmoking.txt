Back on the chain gang....

Stopped for 4 weeks at end of last year, before using a bad crave as an excuse for "just one"... and then a pack and then....well you all know how  it ends. So after 4 months flirting with quitting I've thrown out my last pack and started day one of my new (and final) quit. I'm 6 hours in and feel shitty but it's manageable. Can I scream now? :)

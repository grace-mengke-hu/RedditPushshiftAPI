Used to smoke on long phone calls

Just got off a very long, bureaucratic phone call. Instinctively got up to have a smoke. Ended up pacing around instead, opened the front door and closed it because it's too hot out to sit outside for no reason. Then I realized that's it, there was never a reason to sit in hot, cold, rain, humidity. 

I think it's gonna stick.

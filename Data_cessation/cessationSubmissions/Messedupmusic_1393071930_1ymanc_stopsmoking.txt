Day 5 no tobacco at all! feeling proud at how easy it is.

Hi guys,

i am on day 5 of no tobacco and to be honest i used to worry about how hard quitting would be and if i would ever be able to do it but now i know just how easy it is.

in fact i am not even worried about if I was to start again(although that is not going to happen) as i know stopping is not as daunting as i thought.

just FYI i am going "cold turkey" no ecig or gum and i have smoked solidly for 10+ years. My advice to anyone trying is 1.you must really want to not smoke. 2. Just get past the first two days after that it really is not that hard just the odd thought an i was slightly snappier with people than normal( i apologized obviously).

but after two days its fairly smooth sailing and i feel like not smoking gives me the same feeling as working out i feel great, every morning i feel fresh i am literally loving life right now.

So to anyone who finds the thought of quitting daunting do not be afraid it is not that hard, you just have to want to quit.

Sorry if i come across as as "ohhh its soo easy for me blablabla" i just feel shocked how easy it has been.

Cheers

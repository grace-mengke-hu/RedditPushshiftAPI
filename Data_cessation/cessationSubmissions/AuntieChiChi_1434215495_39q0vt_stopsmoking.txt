Hello! Just quit 11 days ago and found this sub today! Trying to change my mindset...

So, I really do want to quit.  I know all the reasons to quit and I believe in all of them strongly.  My son is a big reason for me to quit, as well as my husband - but, to be honest, I **like** being a smoker.  It has been a part of my self-identify for a long time now and I am having the hardest time giving that part up.  

I've broken the habits - no smoking after a meal, in the car, with my coffee, etc.  I've rearranged things and activities to help with triggers plus I have incorporated a few replacement things when I do experience a trigger.  

But I still miss the idea of smoking.   Does this go away?  I assume it just becomes...less.  Advice?  :)

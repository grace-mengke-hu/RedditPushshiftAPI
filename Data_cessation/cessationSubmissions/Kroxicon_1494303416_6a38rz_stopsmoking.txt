Stopped smoking sunday at 6pm.

I'v been wanting to stop for a while now, couldn't find the motivation to stop, sunday i was so hungover the thought of smoking made me ill. I haven't smoked since sunday but i need help to keep going. 

Today i was having cravings, and instead of giving in i found the last amount of tobacco i had and threw it in the toilet. 

I really really don't want to smoke anymore but because of anxiety and depression etc i can have a tough time with stuff like this. (I am aware smoking can increase anxiety, but you know, addiction.)

Most if not everyone around me smokes, and i don't think leaving everyone because of that is the right way to go. What can i do in situations where people might smoke and i can't leave.

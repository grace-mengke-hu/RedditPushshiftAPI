Cravings are insane

I can not go without thinking about smoking for longer than 60 seconds, I have a constant anxious feeling in my chest and the idea of it being easier to jump of the balcony just outside is actually running through my head. (and I am not even suicidal or anything)

Has anyone else had this? I am constantly thinking about how my family is coming to visite in a week and I will probably just start smoking again if these are the cravings im feeling. I try to justify the thoughts by telling myself its the addiction speaking, but I think it is a good thing im at work right now, because I am not alone. As soon as I get back to my studio for the weekend, I doubt I am going to make it through the weekend. The 2nd day is being a bitch and I am losing faith in myself, any tips?

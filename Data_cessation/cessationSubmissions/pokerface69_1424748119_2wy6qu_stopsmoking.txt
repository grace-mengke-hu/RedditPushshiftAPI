holy shit saved!

recently due to work pressure and other commitments I'm feeling scared and craving cigs more than I used to but I can easily dismiss cravings almost all of the time, otherwise I read a few posts here from my phone. 

I just woke up from a dream where I bought a pack of ciggies , now even in my dream I was still debating weather to smoke or not. I was even feeling guilty to buy a pack. 
I am so thankful it was a dream ._.

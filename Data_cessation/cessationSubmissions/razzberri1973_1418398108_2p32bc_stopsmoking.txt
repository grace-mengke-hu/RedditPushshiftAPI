1095 days.

Tomorrow is my birthday and it will mark 3 years since I had my last cigarette. It wasn't always easy, and I still have a weird craving once in a blue moon, but I'm still a non-smoker. 

I just wanted to throw some encouragement out to anyone who's struggling right now. I was a pack-a-day off and on for 25 years (age 13-38). If I did it, you can too. Three years may seem like a long way off, but it IS possible, and I want you all to know that :) You got this!

Celebrating day 3 with lots of beer!

hey r/stopsmoking! Im kind of drunk so excuse me if i am less articulate than ususal but an hour ago i officially made it three days without smoking! tbh it hasnt even been that difficult once i finally summed up the courage to quit cold turkey. i just got tired of sounding like gollum all the time and getting disapproving looks from my family and my underage coworkers who havent yet learned the power of peer pressure. Although i did attempt to watch mad men earlier and couldnt make it past five minutes, but people have a lot worse problems to deal with. Fuck paying to kill myself slowly!

Quit about 2 and a half months ago

I quit smoking in March of 2015, switched to vaping for the remainder of the time and quit 2 months ago-ish, the issue I'm having is my lungs feel like shit. Mucous feeling, however unproductive coughs. Pretty much since I quit. I was wondering if anyone else has felt the same way, it's kind of concerning because at times I feel the phlegm in my throat feeling and it tends to kick start my anxiety. 

tldr- quit vaping, mucous in lungs, feel like shit

Want to try to quit vaping again

This is about the only place I know of to go to for support... so here I am.

I'm tired of vaping, I don't like what nicotine does to me. I feel like it's just a handicap, and doesn't give me anything beneficial. So I want to quit.

I quit for 31 days at one point, but I caved in again.

I'm pretty sad right now.

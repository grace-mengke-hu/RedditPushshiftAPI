I would like to share a huge moment of achievement

Some friends asked me to pick up some packs of cigarettes from the store when I was going out.  4 friends plus me is 5, and I came out of the store with only 4 packs of smokes.  No pack for me.

It's amazing to think only a month or so ago I would have been digging into them before I even left the store; that time, I didn't open one pack, didn't want a single cigarette.  One of the packs of even my favorite brand too.

So thanks to everyone for helping me accomplish this victory and I hope that everyone has successes in quitting smoking too!

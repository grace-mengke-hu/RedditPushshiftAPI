Quit for a week, relapsed and trying again.

I decided to quit smoking two weekends ago. Last weekend while out drinking I broke and borrowed a cig from a dude at the bar, thing is it made me throw up (mainly the booze but it made me a little sicker).

So this week I'm trying again but the mood swings are killing me. I get too anxious at work and in class. I feel like punching anyone around that so much as utters a word a bit too loud, I can't concentrate on anything. This "attacks" happen maybe once every hour or two.

I have a friend at work who has a vaper and sometimes we go down to hit a few and I think that's the only thing that's keeping me sane.

I started yoga this week and it's awesome for winding down but it's only one hour a day, how do I get through the other 23?

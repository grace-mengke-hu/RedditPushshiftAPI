Started Champix today... I forgot how bad this is

So I quit 12 months ago, took champix for the full three months and at the end of it somone I loved very much passed away. I flew back home to her family of smokers and at the funeral I started again. Crap excuse I know.

So I'm done with smoking again. I saw the doctor, got a script for champix and took my first dose this morning. I forgot how crap the side effects are for me. I threw up on the walk to work 30 mins later. Everything tastes different and I'm tired as all hell.

So this thread is more to help keep me motivated, log my thoughts and help me through the first week or two where I remember it being the worst. I'll do my best to answer any questions anyone has and am 100% open to try things anyone found help them through the first leg.

Wish me luck!

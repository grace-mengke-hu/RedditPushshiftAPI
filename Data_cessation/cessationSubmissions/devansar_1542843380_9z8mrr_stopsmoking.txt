Please tell me it gets easier

I work at a job where they'd let me smoke during my entire shift if I could. I usually smoke about 3/4 of a pack in a 12 hour shift and this is my first night without smokes. This is hard. I am so bored out of my mind now. I think I will go see how many pushups and sit ups I can do.

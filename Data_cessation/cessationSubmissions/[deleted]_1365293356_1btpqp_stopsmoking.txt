Cold turkey 2 days 20 hours 29minutes...

I'm doing it cold turkey this time. I've tried a lot of nicotine replacements and have decided they are dumb and partially a money grab.. Nicotine replacements just prolong the suffering. I haven't felt this good at 68hrs ever.... Not saying I feel great but sure of a lot better then last time on lozenges.
I also reward myself at certain hours... which will later become days and eventually weekly.. at 48 hours i got a nice reward from my wife. ;) 
Which brings me to telling you guys get a support buddy.. someone that isn't scared to yell at you, to yell back to be just plain mean and give you some tough love. I was a bear the first day, my wife quickly put me back in my place.
I'm fortunate to have a wife that stays home with the kids. So she is able to answer most of my calls and texts when i need someone to talk to. If you don't have someone like that get 3 or 4 buddies. someone that can always talk on the phone, another for the texts and someone to talk to in person. 
I plan on making a bigger purchase when I feel confident that the habit is kicked. I'm thinking of financing a bed set or new couches. Use the money that I would have spent smoking. Not just for me but for my awesome wife, support buddy, best friend.
Oh I'm using day counter app on WP8 it's a huge help seeing the time that I've achieved as a non smoker!

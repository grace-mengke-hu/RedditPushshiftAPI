First drink since quitting.

Towards the end of the can I just popped in some gum, I'm not sure about you guys but gum (regular chewing gum) has worked wonders for replacing the smoking habit. Also holy shit it's almost been 40 days, I know you hear this over and over but once you go through it it's true; it gets easier. Just taking it day by day here and I think about smoking less and less each day.

I used to be 31 years old 15 days ago. Now getting younger everyday!

This feels like a new life! Although I stopped smoking only 15 days ago, I already feel like I've been given a second life in a brand new body! Its amazing to see all these changes on me: Now I remember my childhood when running, dancing and jumping non-stop was so easy. Yesterday I had no trouble in cycling for 20 KM!

Gave up for 9 months but been smoking again for 3 weeks. Time to start again. Day 1 take two

I started seeing a guy who smoked and a puff here and there turned into a cigarette here and there and before you know it i was buying my own packs and back to 20 a day. I feel physically awful. I thought i had a virus that had me with headaches stomach ache and fatigue and a chest infection. Shaky and anxious all day. It started that first day i started smoking full time again and its still here. Its dawned on me this isnt a virus, i think this is all those toxins in my body again.. i hope now that im quitting again this will all ease up ive felt like absolute shit for weeks now. And if it is i hope this post serves as a reminder to myself anytime i consider smoking again. I never wanna feel like this again.

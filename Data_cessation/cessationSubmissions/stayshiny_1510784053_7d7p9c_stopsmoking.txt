Beginning a long journey today.

Alright guys and girls, how are you? 

I've been lurking on here for a good year or something, picking up advice but never really committing to something. I had my last smoke around 7:15pm today after work. 

I've not found it in myself to fully quit so far, I've had a few times where I've gone a week without really feeling terrible, so after doing that a few times I just always figured I could give myself permission to smoke or not smoke because it was easy. Then I realized how much I was spending on cigarettes and that it was having real, tangible effects on my health. 

Lately I've been getting more out of shape, finding it hard to exercise properly and such. That's giving me a definitive incentive to stop smoking. I've also had issues with my hands, pain in my joints and stuff (I'm a 26 year old guy) and along with my general health, this has really motivated me to make a serious and concerted effort to not smoke anymore. 

So, that's it. I think I'm giving myself the best chance by calling it now and taking pride in each day that I don't smoke. I will be setting a target of one month as of now and keep increasing my abstinence from cigarettes. 

I know you guys all see posts like this every day and new non-smokers appear all the time, but hopefully you'll remember me on December 11th when I write my month of being smoke free post!

Thanks, by the way, for all the support you've already unknowingly given me. Now onwards to a better, healthier life!

This is it

Hi all, I just wanted to check in and let everyone know I've given up the smokes. I smoked about 10-15 per day for about 12 years and stopped forever about three days ago. It's not my first attempt, but it will be my last. I'm grateful that this community exists; it's great to know that there are so many others doing the same thing.

Just had something funny happen while reading Allen Carr’s book for the first time

I got the book from the library next to my house, was reading the book and came to the chapter benefits of smoking and it was blank. So I was confused and thought my copy had a error and walked eight minutes back to the library and proceeded to go through three other copies there before realizing that the point of the chapter was to point out that there is no benefits but for some reason my brain didn’t want to believe it. Stupid I know haha.

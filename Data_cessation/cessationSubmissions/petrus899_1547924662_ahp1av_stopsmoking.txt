Here we go again...

It’s been awhile since I’ve posted here, mainly because I took up smoking again. I justified it by telling myself that I was doing fine because I was only smoking 1-2 cigs a day. I’m about 17 hours into my current quit, which I seriously hope I can stick to this time. I’m nearing that time of the morning where I would have my usual smoke, so I’m feeling a bit anxious. Just posting here as a means for me to feel like I have bit of accountability. I’m really hoping I can do this.

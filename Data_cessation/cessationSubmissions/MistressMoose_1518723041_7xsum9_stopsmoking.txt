We got this, together!

After lurking around on this sub for a bit I decided, what the heck, I can do this. 

I'm not going to kid myself; I am a vain person. I always thought of smoking as cool, you know that whole "Death Wish" thing, but then I read a post, that I will never find again where someone said something along the lines of 'when your in your 20's and healthy sure it looks cool, but nobody looks cool when they are 50 and coughing, and if I don't quit now, I'll just end up being that 50 year old smoker.'

So, sorry for the rambling on, but I just wanted to say, here is to us staying healthy longer and quitting today (or continuing to be non smokers)!

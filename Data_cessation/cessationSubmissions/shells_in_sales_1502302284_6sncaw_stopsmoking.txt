Just starting

I just finished reading Alan Care's book and just started my freedom.  Am I supposed to have absolutely 0 urge to smoke? Because right now I'm having cravings, but I'm finding them easy to resist by using stuff from the book. But I certainly don't have 0 cravings and it's weird because I have an urge to smoke but certainly no desire to do so.

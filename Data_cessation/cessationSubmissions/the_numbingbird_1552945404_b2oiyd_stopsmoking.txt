31/f Quitting again. This is day one. Crazy high heart rate and very discouraged. Need to get fit for my job. Need your help.

I've smoked now for three years. I've never been able to quit for longer than about 3 weeks. I have to do it this time. I'm going into firefighting and I cant do the work I need to. 

I cant get in shape because my heart rate spikes to insane levels from even light exercise (I just took my heart rate using my galaxy s9 and my heart rate is 107... I'm lying in bed!).

I'm so depressed. I'm a 31 year old female and used to be in great shape. I got injured during fire training which is one of the times I started smoking again (about 4 months ago now)


Any encouragement on peoples experience with their heart rate dropping after it was crazy high during exercise would be greatly appreciated. I turn blue and get a heart rate of 190 when I try anything high intensity. 

-The first time I quit, it never went down after 3 weeks of exercise. That was really discouraging -


I really need to hear people could barely exercise at first but got their lungs back in shape and heart down. 

Im usually not the type to ask this kind of thing, but really need it right now.

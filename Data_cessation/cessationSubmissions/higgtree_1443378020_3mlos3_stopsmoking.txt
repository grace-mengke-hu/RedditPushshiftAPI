One year ago today...

I put down cigarettes for the last time.  I went cold turkey, and never went back. I had work stress, road rage, drunken nights out, arguments with my 8 year old daughter, the 3rd anniversary of my mom's death... And I didn't pick up a single cigarette. I'll see you guys next year for my 2nd anniversary.

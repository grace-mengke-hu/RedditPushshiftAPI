Anyone else experienced physical withdrawls while using the patch?

Hey guys-
First of all, thank you to a all the amazing people on this sub. I've found a lot of motivation just from browsing around here and knowing that there are other people who are in the same boat as me. 
Today is my third day without a cigarette, usually a pack a day smoker on and off for about 6 years (ugh). I was lucky enough to have my father care enough about me to help me kick this shit and buy me my first box of step 1 patches. The first day and yesterday weren't so bad, but today has been a totally different story. I was sitting in class this morning and all of the sudden had a full blown panic attack. Heart racing, ears ringing etc and just had to GTFO of the lecture hall. Luckily I was able to distract myself well enough to pass the initial craving, but since have been noticing some nasty symptoms of withdrawal. Strange, because I thought that the patch was supposed to soothe the pangs of physical withdrawls. I've been noticing hot/cold flashes, general achy feelings in my whole body, specifically headaches and chest pain, as well as shakiness and sensitivity to light. Very flu-like, but I know I'm not sick. Just curious if others have had the same symptoms as I have been experiencing while using the patch. Maybe they're more psychologically related than physical, I just don't know. 
I'm determined to kick this habit in the balls and say adios forever, but I guess what I'm trying to say is that this hump is killing me, and I know I haven't even hit the worst of it yet. 
Any advice/suggestions will be awesomely appreciated, and again thank you to all those on this sub who are helping others to quit the smoke.

Ps I'm writing this on my phone and in a state of anxiety, so please forgive any spelling/grammar mistakes I may have missed.

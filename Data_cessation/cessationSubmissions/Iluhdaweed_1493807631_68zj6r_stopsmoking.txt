night sweats (day 10) cold turkey

Did anyone have night sweats from quitting cold turkey? And if so, at around what day did you sweat the most? And when did it stop for you? I'm determined to quit forever, just want an indication as to how often and severe the night sweats were from others. Yesterday was the worst so far.

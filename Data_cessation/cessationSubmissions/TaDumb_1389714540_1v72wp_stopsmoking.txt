Today I'm done!

Tired of feeling gross, like I smell all the time. Tired of having to go out in the cold just to smoke! Tired of having nicotine fits, like I have to drop everything just so I can smoke. It's hell at work when that happens. Today, it's over! I grabbed myself a pack of gum and I'm ready. How do I get one of those tags that says how many days I've gone without?

Caffeine and Nicotine withdrawal symptoms

Hi all,

It has been 8 weeks since I've gone cold turkey but still getting strong urge mostly during work hours.

I have been daily on average 6 shots espresso drinker. 

Do you guys think that I might be confusing nicotine and caffeine withdrawal symptoms? 

My nicotine urge lasts more than 30min, repeats itself 3-4 times a day.

thanks

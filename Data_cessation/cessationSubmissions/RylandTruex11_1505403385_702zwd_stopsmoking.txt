Day 37

Finally day 37 and I didn't crave the morning cigarette. When I smoked it was my favorite cig to have because I could catch the nicotine buzz slightly. It's been hard every morning but would chew the gum. Just writing this because I wanted to say thank you to everyone who posts on here because I read this everyday to stay motivated. To everyone contemplating is today the day I quit...my answer to that is..Yes it should be, you'll only appreciate yourself more and more. I have never felt better about myself then I have today/this morning.

Re-emergence of cravings after a while of quitting

Hello, i've quit on 28th of july this year, in 9 days it's going to be two months since the last time i smoked a cigarette, problem is, after 2-3 weeks of quitting, it didn't become easy, it became harder, i get quite strong cravings now after eating food especially.
 I guess it's the psychological addiction kicking in, cinnamon gum helps alot, but i want to teach my body to adapt and overcome the addiction without any substances, not that i don't like the gum, it really helps, but i feel i should be doing this without anything, what are your thoughts?

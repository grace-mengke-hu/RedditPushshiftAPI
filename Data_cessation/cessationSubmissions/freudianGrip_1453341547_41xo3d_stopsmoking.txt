3 Days down, wondering how common my experience is

As the title says, I'm done with day 3. Day 1 sucked. I could not focus at all, which I see is common. About 24 hours in I came real close to breaking. I had convinced myself that I couldn't take that lack of focus at my job and so would have to try the e-cig to gradually go down. So I then walk to the store to buy a pack of cigs saying to myself that I'll give it a go with the e-cig tomorrow. Well I just bought something else when I got there. Didn't get the smokes. After that it's been a breeze. I've not really noticed any other symptoms so far and haven't thought too much about smoking. I'm not sure if there is any weight to this but it seems like that one big mental win kind of got me over the hump psychologically. Obviously that would have nothing to do with the physical lack of symptoms.

I smoked basically a pack a day for 8 years.

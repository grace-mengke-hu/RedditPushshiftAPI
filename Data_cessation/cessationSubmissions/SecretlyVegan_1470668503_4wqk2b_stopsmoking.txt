Worst day ever

I woke up with cravings and the cravings have only left for few short moments during the day. My concentration is non existing and overall I'm feeling like crap. At one point I was fairly sure I was actually losing my mind.

I didn't cut the patch like I told I'd do, instead I bought a new pack of patches that have less nicotine. So I went from 15mg/16h to 10mg/16h not a humongous drop, but apparently it feels like one.

On the positive side I have not given in on the cravings and I have a very clean house, after all the cleaning I've done today.

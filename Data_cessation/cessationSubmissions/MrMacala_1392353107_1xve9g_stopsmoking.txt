Day 1, again, for the last time... again..

I have stopped smoking for a week or two, several months all the way 3 quarters. I still fail due to my own poor judgement.

Work is difficult to consider without the time warp smoking does. However I need to do it for my health and for my S.O.

Wish me luck, I will keep a journal of my progress.

Thanks for all the tips and tricks!

Here we go again: almost 24hrs since last marlboro.

I smoked for 18 years, quit for 5+, and have been smoking again for the past year and a half.

Back on Wellbutrin, which helped in the past, and struggling to go 24 hrs. I always seem to find an excuse for one more smoke :-(

But this feels like the one.

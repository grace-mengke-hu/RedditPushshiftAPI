Day one after 21 years of smoking.

Hi all,
I am quitting, again. Like everyone else, I have quit many times before. But I want this to be the last time. 
I started smoking in the Navy, at age 18, just to get a break from the flight deck. Then kept smoking in port while drinking with my buddies. Then kept smoking when returned home. Now 21 years later... I'm Done. Went to bed last night after my last cig and awaaaaaay we go.
Congrats to all those who have quit! And congrats to all those who are thinking about it! 
It's time for me.

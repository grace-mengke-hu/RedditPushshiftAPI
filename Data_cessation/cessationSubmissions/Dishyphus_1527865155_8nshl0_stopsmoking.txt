37 days without a cigarette. Day 1 without nicotine. This is possible, right?

It was extraordinarily difficult for me to put the cigarettes down.  The first week I was off my mind.  I felt and acted like a monster...  even with using an e-cigarette.  
  
It's been 37 days and I know that if I don't put the vape down I don't think I'll be able to later down the road.  It's been a life safer during my time using it and I don't regret it at all but I know I need to be nicotine free and break any cigarette type habit.  I need to be quit the fuck quit.  
  
That being said I'm a fucking shit show at the moment.  "It's never a good time to quit", anxiety and stress have reached critical levels over things that are happening in my life that's already making me a monster again.  So, you know, I decided to add something that I don't feel like I'm capable of doing.  
  
I've read Allen Carr, I have a fidget spinner, activities I can do, support I can lean on, healthy food (maybe), real life things to take care of, therapy...  
  
But how do I get myself to do these things?  Have any of you while quitting experienced just sitting in the negative and the cravings and just spinning the fuck out without being able to GET to the things that are supposed to make it easier?  Because that's my hold up and it's gonna kill me.  
  
tl;dr - I get paralyzed by all the feels and don't do the things that are supposed to help and stew in mental garbage.  Help?

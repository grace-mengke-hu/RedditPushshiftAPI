Your top 3 tips for new nonsmokers

Mine would be:

1. Successful quitting is a learning curve. I tried over a dozen times and failed very miserably, only now I am at a point where I have the skills to stay smokefree and happy.

2. Always remember that you had a life before smoking, and that cigarettes are not part of you identity, only once you became hooked it became a part of your reality. Now I can look back on those days when I just began fooling around promising myself to stop before it got out of hand, anything in between is just a distant memory.

3. Quitting is a bit like having this really really itchy mosquito bite. You really want to scratch it, but if you withhold long enough it just goes away on its own, without you tearing your skin off and prolonging it. Remember that you can get the itch back any moment you let the mosquito bite you, so cut off all forms of nicotine if you want to be truly free.

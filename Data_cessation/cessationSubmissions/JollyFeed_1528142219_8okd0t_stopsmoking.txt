How Long Do The Vivid Dreams Last??

I'm hating these vivid dreams from quitting smoking. Last night I dreamed about an ex I'd forget ever knowing. Other dreams are just as disturbing because they're hard to shake off once I've woken up and stay on my mind throughout the day. I'm assuming these dreams are vivid because my brain is healing itself from the chemical imbalance imposed on it by smoking. I've noticed my brain is less foggy and my concentration is getting sharper. So, how long do the dreams last?

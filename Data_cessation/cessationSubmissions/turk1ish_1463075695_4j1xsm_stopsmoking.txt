Day 2 report

Have 2 days off work so i got to sleep in! I woke up with a minor craving but it quickly passed.

For those of you who are coffee drinkers, i found that sweetening my coffee a bit extra has helped not trigger any cravings.

Day one was the worst one I've had yet. I felt completely loopy and couldn't focus on anything. Today, however, feels a lot better.

I started off my day with a trip to the grocery store and bought a ton of fruit that was on sale! So today has been a good day.

I'm either going to go for a hike or head to the beach today. Will post photos!

Final Day of my First Week

I on the final day of my first week without smoking. I am using the patches to quit. Did not want to use e-cigarette as need to stop altogether. Using patches and is so far working. Cravings are manageable and only last about 10-15 mins per time. So if I can do a week then I can do 2, and then 4 etc.

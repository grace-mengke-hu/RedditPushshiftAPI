Weight Gain is Discouraging

When I smoke I'm a very heavy smoker. I've quit many times before. I've always gained an insane amount of weight when quitting. Usually somewhere between 20 and 25lbs. 

From January to May of this year I lost about 25lbs that I needed to lose. After the weight loss I was still technically overweight, but only by about 5lbs. I maintained the weight loss for a few months and....then I quit smoking 3 weeks ago. I don't feel like my eating patterns have changed at all. I'm using myfitnesspal to track my calories. I'm still using NRT. Vaping and using lozenges. I might even be more active because of the random things I'm doing to distract myself. Deep cleaning my house. Walking. Dancing. Playing with my kids.

I've gained 9lbs. In. 3. Weeks. This is really discouraging to me. I'm doing so well with not smoking but if I continue to gain I don't know what I'll do.  

I guess I know what I NEED to do. Eat even less. Exercise more. But I'm not even sure that will work. :( 

Anyone else struggling with this right now? Suggestions?

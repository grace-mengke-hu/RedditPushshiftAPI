How did you feel after you quit?

I've tried to Google it but can't find much. I guess I'm just curious to know how others have felt along the way. How'd you feel a month in, 6 months in ect.. I'm a little over a week in after being a daily smoker for 20 years.  I currently have times where I'm feeling very very tired, irritable, and my emotions can be a bit out of whack.. Other than that though it feels great thinking of the money I'll be saving and that I'm doing myself something so kind.  Good luck to all of you on the same path! I hope we find equal success!!

Dealing with anger and irritability

How do you deal with the nicotine (and god knows what else) withdrawals? I am depressed and pissed off. I work out 6 days a week and have kept it up, but i feel weak and tired and stressed and just overall i'm a dick lately. I can't really focus, i'm having a hard time finding motivation. I feel cloudy and feel as if i can't form intelligent thoughts. People driving too slow is even driving me crazy ha! What are some of your methods for dealing with all of this? It sucks!

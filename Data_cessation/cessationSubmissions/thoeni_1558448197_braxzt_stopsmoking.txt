God Damit! Relapse after 25 Days. I need some encouragement

Dear Reddit, 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like absolut f\*cking crap! I stoped smoking and didnt touch a cigarette for 25 Days and last Friday i smoked again. Every evening since, i told myself that i wont be smoking tomorrow but in the morning i feel like shit and think that somehow smoking will help me. I hate myself for it and my self-worth is at an absolute low-point. 

&amp;#x200B;

My idiot reasoning to smoke again was because i was in a major hole. I felt sad and depressed and i was hoping smoking a cig would help that... And it did... But now i hate myself even more for it and i know that it will be as difficult as the first time again. After three weeks of not smoking i felt physically healty as never before. And now its all in the Trash.

&amp;#x200B;

Please send me some motivation and encouragement if you have some left. Im a grown ass man close to tears right now.

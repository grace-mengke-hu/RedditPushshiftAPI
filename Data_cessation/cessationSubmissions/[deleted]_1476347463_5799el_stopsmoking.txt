Reduced intake for 4 days, time to not smoke again

So for the past few days I had "officially" quit but instead gave in but managed to reduce my intake drastically. Yesterday I had only 3 cigarettes. Usually I would have half a pack to a full pack. The more I get it into my mind I want to quit the more disgusted I feel when I smoke. And I'm ready to start day 1 on this journey with no smokes at all. Resetting my badge right now to be honest with myself. I WILL do it, and I will not look back.

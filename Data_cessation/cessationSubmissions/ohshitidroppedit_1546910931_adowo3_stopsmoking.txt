It's time

The last straw was the other day when I slept over my Grandma's house and woke up to her coughing and gagging for like 5 minutes straight, due to the fact that she's been smoking since she was 8. Not the first time I've heard her do that, but I don't really see her much, and hearing that in person just going on and on was horrifying. 

I'm 20 and have been smoking since I was 15. I still live with my parents. I have zero self control, so I told my mom to hide my cigarettes and give me 6 a day for a week or two, then 5, then 4, and so on until I stop. It is SO HARD going from chain smoking a pack a day to smoking just 6 a day, and eventually none. My anxiety is through the roof and my brain is begging for another smoke, but nope. I know I can quit if I stay serious about it. 

Also just to clarify, my parents never allowed me to smoke. I got into it myself because I was young and thought smoking was fun and a good way to relax, until I found out I couldn't stop. Then I turned 18 and they knew they couldn't force me to stop unless I really wanted to.

I just had a cigarette, 5th of the day, going to smoke one more later on, then that's it for the day. I'm DYING for another cigarette. But later on in life I'll be literally dying from lung cancer and I don't want to end up sounding like my grandmother, as mean as that sounds.

That being said, I'm looking forward to a life of more money, less coughing/clearing my throat, and easier breathing. I know I'll have to fight the urge to smoke probably for the rest of my life, but I have my nicotine lozenges, I have my friends and family to support me, and I can get a vape if I decide I really need something to get me through the day, even though I'd have to stop that sometime too. I can also get lollipops, I heard that they're a good way to distract yourself from smoking. 

Not sure if anyone's gonna read this entire thing but I needed to vent somewhere. Wish me luck!

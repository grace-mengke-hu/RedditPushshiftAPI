8 days now. New tactic.

To anyone reading this sub and is feeling inspired to quit. I will give you a few of the benefits I am currently basking in after only a week.

- Skin feels great.
- Hangover isn't as bad.
- I don't have people thinking "This guy stinks. Smoke smell is so bad."
- No more coughing.
- Energy increasing.
- Not having to go outside for a smoke in a social setting and missing out on banter.
- Continually decreasing odds of long-term ill health.
- More attractive to the other sex for all the reasons above.
- Lastly, not being weak.

Long may it continue! To everyone who is quitting or has kicked the habit, big up yourself! Those who are waiting to do it, just do it!

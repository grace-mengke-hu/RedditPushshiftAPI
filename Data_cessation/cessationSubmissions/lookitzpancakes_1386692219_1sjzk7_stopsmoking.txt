I have a week to quit smoking...what's the best way to do this for myself?

To clarify, I started smoking when I was 18 years old. When I took up the nasty habit, I told myself that I would quit when I was 25. It seemed like an eternity away, but it also seemed like the right time to stop early enough and avoid as much permanent damage as possible.

Well, guess what! I'm turning 25 on Sunday and I need to stop.

:(

Now that I have the foresight of 5 or so days before I'll be quitting, what does r/stopsmoking recommend I do? What's the best way to go about this? Should I just quit outright? Like, right now? Should I ween myself off until Sunday? Should I keep smoking normally and then stop cold turkey at midnight on Sunday?

**Basically, what will make this easiest on me?**

**EDIT:** Just for anyone who is interested, I quit on Wednesday, December 11th! Allen Carr's book was incredibly helpful. And I'm so happy that I've quit. I know life will be better. THANK YOU GUYS!

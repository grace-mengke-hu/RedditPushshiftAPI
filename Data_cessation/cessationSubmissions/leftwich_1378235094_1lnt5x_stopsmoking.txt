Never Again

I smoked my last cigarette last night at around 9 and haven't smoked since. I really needed to do this. Not only am i going to save money but im going to save my health. I work outside and its easy to just light up a cig and do my job, today i went the entire day without smoking, it felt great. 

Today was my goal date to stop smoking and it had been for over a month. I came into today mentally prepared and i am positive last night i smoked my last cigarette ever. BTW i'm 27 and been smoking since i was 18. 9 years too many.

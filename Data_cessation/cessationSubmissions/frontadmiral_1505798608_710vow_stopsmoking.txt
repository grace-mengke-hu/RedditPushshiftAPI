When do I stop wanting to kill someone

I quit cold turkey yesterday after I woke up coughing up blood. I'm a 22 year old male who has been roughly a pack-a-day smoker for 3 years. I physically feel a little better already but mentally I feel like I'm in the throes of puberty all over again, with the angst, anger, irritability, and insomnia. Do y'all have some tips, encouragement, etc? What do I do about the fact that I miss the physical act of rolling cigs so much?

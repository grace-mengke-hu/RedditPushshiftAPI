Day 1!

I haven't smoked today. I got the Smoke Free app. I'm fighting cravings on and off, but doing alright so far.   

I've been a smoker for about nine years. At the most I was smoking about a pack and a half a day, was also drinking pretty heavily and regularly. For the last two years or so, I've been maintaining roughly 4-6 cigarettes a day (unless drinking, but I don't do that much anymore).  

I haven't talked to anyone about wanting to quit, I think I'm afraid of looking like a failure if I can't do it.  

But if I can make it through today, I will be incredibly proud.

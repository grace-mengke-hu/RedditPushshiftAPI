One Month Today!!!!

I honestly can't believe it.  I have been using the Smoke Free app, patches and this sub to get me through.  I know the work isn't over and I still have a long road ahead, but I have been looking forward to posting this since I started lurking on this sub over a month ago.  Thank you all for your posts and comments!  This sub has truly shown me what a powerful tool community can be to overcome addiction.  <3

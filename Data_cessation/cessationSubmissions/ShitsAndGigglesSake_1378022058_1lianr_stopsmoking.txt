[idea]What do you guys think about a buddy system? Some one-on-one support for guys in the initial days of quitting?

I relapsed and will be resetting my badge. I have a friends who've never smoked and and friends who smoke but have never quit. It'd be great if there was some one-on-one buddy system who I can yell at when I'm craving and who I can lean on when I'm vulnerable. Someone who's been through it. Just an idea, what do you guys think?

I got the inspiration from the chat transcript b/w /u/redtaboo and /u/sodypop .

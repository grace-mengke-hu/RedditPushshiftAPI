Day 5- Doing very well but beginning to discover that excessive gas and flatulence is apparently a pretty common withdrawal symptom.

Seriously guys, it's getting a little embarrassing, I haven't stopped in three days.. and it is *toxic*. 

How do/did you guys cope? And how long can I expect this to continue?

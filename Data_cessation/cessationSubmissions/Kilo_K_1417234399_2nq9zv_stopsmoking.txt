What are your personal tips or tricks to quitting smoking?

I have tried various things to try and quit smoking, reading Allen Carr's book, avoiding stressors, etc... I am looking for different methods, viewpoints, or other things in the hopes that one sticks with me! In the past I have primarily tried to quit due to the cost (5 packs a week at $15 and going up to $16.50 shortly), but now I have a girlfriend with a child that is adding an additional motivator. In most cases, I feel like a very logical person that can avoid things that harm me, but smoking seems to have complete control over me. Stop smoking, what has worked for you?

Edit: Apologize for my badge.. it is from my last attempt at quitting :(

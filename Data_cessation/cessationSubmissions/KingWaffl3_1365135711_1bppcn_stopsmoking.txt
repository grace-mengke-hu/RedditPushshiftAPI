Quit cigarettes? Other stuff ok?

I am honestly really trying to quit smoking, its a waste of my money and i can just feel my body getting worse every month. But even before i started i would have the occasional cigar, smoke a hookah with some friends, and well weed, even some pipe smoking. But if i quit the cigs do you think i should quit the other stuff? do you guys view it just as bad or that it will pull me back to my cigs?

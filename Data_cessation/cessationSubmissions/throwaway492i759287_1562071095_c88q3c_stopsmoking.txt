Tips for quitting needed

I'm 15 years old, I steal cigarettes from my mother almost daily and I smoke maybe 2-6 cigarettes a day, average usually 3 or 4. I know I should stop smoking before it gets even worse. Could somebody give me some tips to quit? I'm getting a vape tomorrow which might help however. 

Thanks

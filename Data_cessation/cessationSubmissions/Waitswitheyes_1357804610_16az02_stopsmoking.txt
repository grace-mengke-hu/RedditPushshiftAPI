I ran out of tobacco this morning...and decided not to buy anymore... Here we go!

I've tried to quit a number of times, lost count of how many since starting to smoke 10+ years ago.

I've used lozenges, patches, gum, e-cigs.....

I am so sick of smoking. 

But today I feel more determined.

Hopefully on my 31st birthday next Friday I can say I have been smoke free for a "whole" 7 days (because I've smoked already today, don't want to cheat!)

Here it goes!

EDIT: Thanks everyone for their encouragement!

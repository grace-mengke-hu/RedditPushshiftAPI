Well, shoot. I’m an idiot.

I made it over 100 days. I was so proud of myself. And then, guess what? I fucked it all up. I have no clue what persuaded me to do it, but I had a cig. I found one that I had forgot was lying around in my desk, and somehow justified that I had made it this far, one cig won’t hurt. Two packs later, the reality is setting in that I screwed up royally. I feel like shit guys. I thought smoking was out of my life for good, and now I feel like a complete failure. Why the hell did I choose to screw up my quit?? It had been YEARS since I made it that far without one, and I can’t believe I gave into the impulse to smoke. I’ve been avoiding posting anything about it on here, mainly because I’m ashamed. Ugh. This sucks. 

Tl;dr Made it over 100 days without a cig, found one in my house, gave into the urge to smoke it and feel like an asshole.

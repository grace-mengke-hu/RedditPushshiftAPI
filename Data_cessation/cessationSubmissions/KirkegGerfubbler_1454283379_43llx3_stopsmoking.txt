Constant farting while on patch problem

So I used to smoke about a pack a day for about seven years and decided to quit when I realized I actually do want to live a long life. I've been on the patch for a week and after the first couple days have not felt the need to smoke whatsoever, and could even refuse a cigarette without much trouble when somebody offered me one the other day. I feel great, love not leaving whatever I'm working every hour, love not feeling self-conscious about smelling like smoke and I'm breathing better (my lungs feel awesome when they fill up with air).

My question is: why am I farting literally every 2 minutes? I thought that the nicotine was the thing which messed with your digestion, but I have the patch, so I still have the nicotine. The patch delivers 21 mg of nicotine every 24 hours which should be just about what you absorb by smoking a pack a day (I've read you absorb about 1 mg per cig).

Is there something else about quitting cigs which messes up your digestion, or should I see a doctor? Because my farting is out of control.

Thanks and good luck to anybody else quitting.

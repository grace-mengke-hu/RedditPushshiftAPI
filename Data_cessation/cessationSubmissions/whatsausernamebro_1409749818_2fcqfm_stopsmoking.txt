Had anyone got any advice about weaning off cigarettes

Hi there. been a smoker for about 13 years started young was about 10 or 11 (typing that just appaled me) so i have found it hard to quit as it has been a habit for the majority of my life. I really need to quit now as a couple of years ago I was diagnosed with crohns disease. Apparently if i stop smoking it will be more affective at keeping the condition at bay than any medication has been proven to be. Has anyone got any advice on weaning from cigarettes as I feel I would be much better at this than going cold turkey. My reasoning for this is my SO is a smoker as well so when she and I have tried to quit at the same time one of us takes the calm/collected persona and the other takes the stressed out craving route. We both end up back where we started. So I think weaning would be much better for both of us. has anyone dropped say 1 smoke a day per week is there any apps or programmes I can download to help with this. So far all I can find Is info on going cold turkey but I personally think weaning would be far more effective. Any response is greatly appreciated. Thanks

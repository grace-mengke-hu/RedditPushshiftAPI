I had a hard time at the gym last night

Why? I thought we were supposed  to have all this energy and my breathing would be back to normal? (or close to it)

I used to train hard while I smoked but last night was different. I felt weak, tired, light headed, I sweat so much, I couldn't even manage to hit the lifts and weight I do on a regular. 

Is this a normal side effect for the first little while? I feel good through the day, but last night.. not so much.

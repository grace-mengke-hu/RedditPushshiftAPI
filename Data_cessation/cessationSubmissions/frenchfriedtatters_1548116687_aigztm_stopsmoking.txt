Just quit about a week and a half ago.

I knew it'd be easier to quit going on vacation. Girlfriend never really liked it and her family definitely didn't know I did to begin with. Told her a couple days in advanced what the plan was.  
  
Well, I had three on the day of my last smoke. 1 in the morning before we left for the vacation, 1 at the airport before we took off, and the last one after the rental car had been packed up. Lit up and enjoyed the last smoke I'll ever have.  
  
To be honest, it wasn't super hard because I was around her family a lot. Bunch of kids. I'd hate to smell like smoke around them. I'm at the hard part, now. Today was my first day back to work. Couldn't stop thinking about going out for a smoke break, especially since I have a co-worker that would go with me. Told him what my plan was. He understands.  
  
Here's to another smoke-free day.

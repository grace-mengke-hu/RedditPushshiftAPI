How potentially dangerous is smoking 2 cigarettes a day?

My boyfriend is trying to quit his smoking habit, but is struggling to go any lower than 2 per day. 

Is it enough to potentially affect his health majorly in the long run? 

I know lung cancer has many factors at work, but is there any possibility of it being just from smoking a few cigarettes per day?

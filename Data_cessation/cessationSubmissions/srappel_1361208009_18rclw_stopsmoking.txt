The start of Day Three... no "case of the Mondays" for this guy, I'm feeling wonderful!

I quit on Friday afternoon and have had almost nothing but positive thoughts all weekend.  I had one argument with my roommate, normally that would have sent me straight to the front porch for a cigarette.  I maintained and did some dishes (angrily).  I'm excited to go to work today and not need to take a break!

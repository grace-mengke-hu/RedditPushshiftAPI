Just quit...need help not smoking again

I have been smoking since I was in my last year of college, so about 4 years. Damn, you never think you'll smoke so long when you first start. I used to hate cigarets, smoking, people who smoked, even the smell and then I became one. I have tried many times, but I keep going back. I promised my wife I would stop when my baby daughter was born but after a couple weeks I started again. This time I am very serious about stopping. I don't want to smoke. I DONT. I am just feeling so down, depressed, my wife is being such a great help but I feel so bad I can't help her around the house, or with the baby, I just want to be left alone. Stay in bed and just feel like shit. I haven't had a square since Monday, so going on to my fourth day now. 

My question is, is depression normal when you quit? Ive been on reddit for a while but I have never really posted something so personal. Any advice will help.

Thanks.

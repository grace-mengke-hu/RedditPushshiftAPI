I'm over it

Hey guys, 

Been lurking around here awhile. Made a couple posts a few months ago. Just wanted to update: It's been over two months. All those slip ups and that start-stopping that first month felt like hell, eventually the biggest motivation to stop was to stop-stopping, if that makes any sense. I was sick and tired of the first 24-48 hours of hell just to hop right back into it a few days after slipping up again. 

I didn't give up, however. Now i've been off patches/gum for about a month and a half, and things are starting to really become easy. I'm talking going from 10+ cravings a day to 1 craving every couple days (usually a pretty bad one though). I feel optimistic about my health and am starting to take the next steps to get these lungs back in shape. 

One of the biggest tips I can give is called the 'nonchalant' approach. It's been the only thing that's kept me sane - being apathetic about quitting smoking. Kinda 'whatever' when people ask you if you want to smoke, or not mentioning it, not saying you're quitting or an ex-smoker but just that you don't smoke. It sets the mind up in a way that not smoking isn't at the forefront of your brain constantly. 

Essentially what I'm trying to say is - thanks for the support when I needed it, for the success stories to keep me going, and to anyone who figures they can't conquer this shit I say keep grinding mother fuckers eventually you'll butt out for good.

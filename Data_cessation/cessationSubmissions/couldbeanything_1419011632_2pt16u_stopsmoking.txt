Just got dumped - not letting it ruin my quit.

I just got dumped from an almost 5 year relationship.  Was tempted to relieve the stress and have another cigarette.  She had an open pack sitting on her nightstand.  Hell, my neighbor keeps a pack outside his door. Resisted the urge, walked around the block, and felt much better about myself. I know I'll get through this, and I know that cigarettes will only make things worse.

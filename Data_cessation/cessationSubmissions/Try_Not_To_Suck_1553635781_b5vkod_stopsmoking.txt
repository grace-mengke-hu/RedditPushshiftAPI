If you're a gamer and haven't quit yet...

It's amazing playing games without having smoke roll up into my eyes or ashes fall in my lap.  Not to mention how much quicker I can react if I don't have a cancer stick stuck in between my fingers.  I even used my Treat Yo Self money that I saved from not buying cigarettes to buy myself a new Nintendo Switch.  Obviously there are far better reasons to quit smoking and this wasn't something I considered, just something I thought about the other day and how much more enjoyable it is to play now.  Good luck, quitters.

Stopping. Hopefully for the last time.

Hey, I had my last cigarette last night, and this is my first day without cigarettes.

I used to be a 'social' smoker, for the past 8 or so years (started when I was 13), and my usage just gradually increased to the point I'm at now (3/4 of a pack a day). I'm a student and this isn't affordable, as well as all of the other obvious problems.

I'm hoping to do it completely cold turkey, although if my cravings get really bad, I wouldn't be completely against vaping.

Wish me luck!

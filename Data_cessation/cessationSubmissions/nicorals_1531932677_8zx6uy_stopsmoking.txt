2 days smoke free, but I am still smoking weed+tobacco

This is my first attempt at quitting smoking. I have been a smoker for the past 10 years, and have smoked marijuana everyday for the past 7 years or so. I smoke weed mixed with tobacco (poppers is what we call them here). I would say I probably smoke about 10-15 poppers a day. Since quitting smoking, I haven't been smoking any more or less than this, but I'm wondering if any of you have experience on whether this is going to hinder or help me. I have mixed feelings about how successful I will be if I try to completely change everything at once, as I have failed in the past in other aspects of my life by trying to change my routine too quickly (ie. trying to eat healthier, trying to work out). I also don't want to be using poppers as a "reward" because I plan on cutting those out in the next two weeks as well. 

Just looking for some opinion and if anyone has any experience if quitting while being a heavy marijuana smoker.  Thanks.

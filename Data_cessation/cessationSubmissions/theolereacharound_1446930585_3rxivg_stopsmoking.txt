What can/should I do with all my leftover Chantix?

According to my flair, it's been 463 days since I've smoked! Huzzah.

I have 3 months worth left of my Chantix prescription. I got a 6 month supply (for whatever reason) and now have all this leftover. Will it go bad? I know it's expensive to get, is it illegal to sell it? Or, give it away? I feel stupid keeping it OR just throwing it away. 

Thoughts?

Don't see myself as a smoker anymore.

Its taken over 6 months but I can finally say I don't see myself as a smoker anymore. I still about cigarettes about once a day and 2 or 3 times a week I have a mild craving but its easily dismissed. I am finally free of the slavery and I am truly thankful and a little proud too.

60 days!!

After 15 1/2 years of smoking a pack a day (or more If I was really stressed) I am officially "Smoke-free"! I can honestly say that because I have gone 60 days, the cravings are GONE, and I can NOT stand the smell any more. 

My tips for anyone wanting to quit:
1. Mind over matter really does exist! If you think you can quit you can!

2. Gum or peppermints or some kind of low calorie snack for those almost unbearable cravings that will come along.

3. Stop finding excuses and just try to quit! You will never know until you try! This quit could be the one that works!

4. Don't judge! If you need meds to help you quit that is 1000% better than the alternative of smoking!

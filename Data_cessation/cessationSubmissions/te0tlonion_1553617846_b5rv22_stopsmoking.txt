Relapsed and Lost All Motivation

I quit smoking with my fiance several weeks ago. We quit everything, weed and cigs and booze. The things we both have problems with to varying degrees. We made the choice to quit along with our newfound dedication to cultivating a healthier lifestyle, spiritual practice, and meditation.

She left me while I was out on a walk the other night. I came back to an empty home and a poorly-written note. I tried to fight it, but I broke and bought a pack. I've also been doing all the other things.

I need to find motivation to do this without her again. Remember myself, I guess. This is the second time I've quit and I know I can do it, I made it years last time. I guess I sort of feel like dying, so its hard to imagine doing something so difficult or anything just for "self-care" right now.. ugh.

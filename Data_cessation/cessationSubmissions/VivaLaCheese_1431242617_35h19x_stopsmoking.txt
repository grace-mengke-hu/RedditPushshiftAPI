The fear of going back to day one

As of this past sunday, I  have been 3 weeks without a cig. It's a habit of mine that has been needing breaking for some time. Tonight I noticed while going out with friends how temping it was to light up. Watching them smoke made me think about how bad I really do want one even though the physical need is gone. It struck me though when I took in the smell. Do I really want to go back to day one? Hell no! I am almost a month without a cig. The will power was frightening in the brief moment when I had to excuse myself to go inside. Thank you all for reminding me that I never,ever, want to go back to day one again.

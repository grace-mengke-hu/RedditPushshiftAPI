I caved and bought a pack after 2 weeks

I quit 3 weeks ago (only really counting 2 weeks because I smoked 7 cigs between the first and second week) and I was feeling so good but I've been having massive nicotine cravings the last 2 days, tonight I caved and bought a pack. I feel so shitty right now I feel like those 3 cigarettes I smoked tonight just undid those 2 weeks of fighting and cleansing. I just wanna spray this pack with water and trash it I just feel so depressed and anxious like I failed after ignoring all those cravings. Smoking those cigarettes made me realize how much better my breathing got because it was so much easier to inhale them. It's kinda bittersweet. I'm only 22 I don't want this to be my life I feel so much better when I'm not smoking but the cravings just knock at me until I give in then feel worse smoking the cigarette than I did quitting.

Silly. Pouty. Jealous.

I'm going to vent for a minute, since venting makes me feel better. Please understand this is me venting and not needing to be talked off the ledge...

Many of my friends vape. Some as a hobby, some started as a way to stop smoking. Many of them use 0 nicotine juice and do it for the flavors, the who can make a bigger cloud and all the mods you can get into. I have never vaped. I've tried a couple different brands of gas station ecigs, before I quit... and I hated them. I'm told there is no comparison to vaping.

Here comes the pouty... I want to try it. Like really a lot. But I know I shouldn't because while I know its a lot different than smoking, I think it would be a trigger. If I were still smoking I would have tried it by now. Had I never been a smoker, I think I would have too. But because I have that 30 year smoking history, I won't. And it kind of pisses me off. Last night, sitting at a party and I was the only one not smoking pot and not vaping... because of this addiction. RAWR!

OK, that's all I had to say, really. I am not going to try it. It would not be psychologically healthy for me. I just guess I had to express my grrrrr-ness over it somewhere. 

:D

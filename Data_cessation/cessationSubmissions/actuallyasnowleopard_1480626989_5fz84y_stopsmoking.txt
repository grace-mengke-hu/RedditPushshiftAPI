I didn't have cravings until I decided I wanted to quit

I bought a pack a few weeks ago while under some stress.  Smoked them all over...a week or so, just a few a day.  Then I said I was done and I didn't smoke at all for about 5 days, and I wasn't craving cigarettes at all.

So, the other day, I bought another pack.  I'm not totally sure why, maybe just a little stressed or something.  Anyway, I smoked about 3 in one day, which was about my average from the last pack, but I decided I really didn't want to get into the habit.

Anyway, like I said, I was able to go without them before.  When I smoked, it was just because I was bored or wanted something to calm my nerves a bit.  But now since I decided about two days ago that I wanted to quit, I'm smoking because I'm craving cigarettes.

Was I maybe craving before and not realizing it?  Had I just not quite formed the habit yet?  I think after this pack I'll try really hard to stop myself from buying another...but the problem is that I kind of enjoy smoking.  I'm really conflicted.

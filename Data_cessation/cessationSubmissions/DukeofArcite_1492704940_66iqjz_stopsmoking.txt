8 days in--feeling good buuut....

The work week is easier to get through: plowing through tasks and leaving $$ at home during the day makes cravings manageable. But this weekend I'm going out of town to see friends and there will be a lot of downtime and drinking: two of my big triggers. I know I can do this. I gather a lot of strength fro this sub. You guys are all champions and make me feel like I can beat this. Cheers!

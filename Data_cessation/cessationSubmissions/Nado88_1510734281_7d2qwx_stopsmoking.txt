Day 14

It’s been officially two weeks since I decided to quit I can’t wait till I complete my first month already. Thanks to smoke free app, honestly not even the money I paid for the full version app is equal to how these people helped me. I wish I can find them and thank them myself for helping me quit a horrible lifestyle of 12 years. Thank you thank you thank you, you’re truly the best people on earth

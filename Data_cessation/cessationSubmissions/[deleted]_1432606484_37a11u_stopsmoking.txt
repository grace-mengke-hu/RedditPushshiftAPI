I need help

I've been smoking since the age of 17 and I am 30 now. I had said I wanted to quit smoking by 30. Last year I read allen carrs, book I lasted 8 months and some how I ended up having one here and there when I was drunk and found myself addicted again. Now I am stressing out every day when I smoke. I now only smoke 3-4 a day. I was hoping that reddit could some how help. At this point I've tried everything besides prescription medications. 

Can you guys me some tips and ideas. How did all of you do it?

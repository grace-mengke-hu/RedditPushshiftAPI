Cigarette packs

Hello quitters!

After all these days of quitting my urge to smoke is gone for the most part. I don't see myself smoking anymore.

But I have one problem; cigarette packs. For some reason they look so pretty for me now. I get a watery mouth when I see the Lucky Strike packs, or when I see the Natural American Spirit packs I feel like I'm looking at the most beautiful thing in the universe.

I'm getting crazy because of this.

Making a website to help others quit (I too was a chain smoker. Been 394 days since my last cigg)

I smoked (chain smoked) for at least 10 years, then left slowly (after a small attack). Anyways, I am making a blog/website to help people quit. It'll have articles, tips etc (already have some). Maybe a forum, store etc etc. Its called: [How To Quit Smoking](http://www.howtoquitsmoking.xyz) - I need logo (umm, any suggestions? i m pathetic in graphics), content (you guys are more than welcome to submit stuff but I wont be able to pay right now).

All suggestions, criticism, help etc is welcome :)

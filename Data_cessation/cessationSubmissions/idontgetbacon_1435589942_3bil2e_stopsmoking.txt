I almost broke over the weekend...

This weekend, my brother's girlfriend had a birthday party for her son. It was one of those "let's do everything on facebook" parties, and it showed. My parents showed up at 1 (party was from 1-4), I was there at 1:30 and I was the second person to show up. Needless to say, everyone was pretty high strung. 

When my parents left, her family finally showed up.. at 330. Her brother tried to diffuse the situation, then excused himself for a smoke. Not wanting to get in the way of the brewing family feud, I followed him, 

I literally had the cigarette in my mouth, about to light it... then I stopped. I decided that I wasn't going to let stress ruin what I have been working on. I apologized, explained that I was trying to quit, and took a walk. 

Not gonna lie, I feel pretty darn proud of myself. :)

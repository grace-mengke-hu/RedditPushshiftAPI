Almost forgot, until my little app reminded me..

I just hit [one year of being smoke free](https://imgur.com/2QqXTRH) !!  It feels really good and I'm just surprised more than anything.  I was smoking just under a pack a day for about 10 years, so this feels like a pretty big milestone when reflecting back.  Thank you to this community as it was this subreddit and reading through so many posts of success stories/tips/tricks that really helped motivate me to want to quit.  I believe in all of you...and yes...it does get easier!

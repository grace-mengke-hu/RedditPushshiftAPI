372 days and I caved.... 

I made it exactly one week after my year..... and bought a pack... so drunk I don't even remember why but I woke up with any empty one and lungs in pain. I was truly addicted again and I HATED myself for letting it happen. I stand here now with a 466 day badge that means nothing. 

Brighter side to the story... My girlfriend of 1 year 6 months and 23 days just broke up with me....... now that I think about it that's pretty sad. However what I'm going through is extremely painful both physically but more so mentally. Anyway, I've decided to channel this frustration, anger, and depression towards quitting again and for good. This community has helped me through this once.... will you still stand by my side?

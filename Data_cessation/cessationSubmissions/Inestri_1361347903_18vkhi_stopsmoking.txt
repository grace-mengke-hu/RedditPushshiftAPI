It's hard :( (rant)

Hi!

I decided yesterday to stop smoking, but it's so hard. I did pretty well since morning, and than broke and smoked 2 1/2 in the evening. I'm clean since then (9am now), and struggling, but i think I'll manage till evening again. It's the hardest then because I'm gaming and I'm used to smoke between kills.

any advice?

also, it's annoying because I don't (didn't) smoke a lot: maybe 5-7-10 ciggs a day, and one would think it would be easy to quit when you don't smoke a lot.

I wanted to go cold turkey, but obviously it wont work. I also DL-ed apps which are very nice and motivating.

IÂ¨'m sorry that this is so chaotic, I'm in the middle of crisis, I feel like my eyeballs will pop out

Edit: Thank you everybody to kind words and encouragement! I wrote this in the morning at work. That was the worse part of the day, but I managed to push trough! It's evening now, and I'm doing great! I hope that continues through the evening.

Also, I told everybody! Friends, parents, cooworkers, even posted it on facebook, that's another motivation not to give up!

Thanks all!

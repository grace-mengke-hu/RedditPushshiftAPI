I made a post celebrating my 1 year, when in fact I was using the wrong date, found out today that it’s my 555th Day nicotine free.

Thanks to those who’ve supported me, and to those who are struggling or even thinking of quitting. You can do it, for the health of you and loved ones, you can do it.

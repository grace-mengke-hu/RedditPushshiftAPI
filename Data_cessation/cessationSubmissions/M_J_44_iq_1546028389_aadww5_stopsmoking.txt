A "not sure if minor or major" setback

I've been clean for six months and a half. It's quite ironic that they say that your chances of staying clean increases significantly after no smoking for 6 months considering that i relapsed a little bit after this milestone mark.


I went the cold turkey route when i stopped smoking (9 years smoker at the time). The first month was hell, the second was also hell but with ventilation, after that i adapted and even the smoke from other people smelled like how it did before i started.


It's funny that at day 20, a clerical error caused me to lose a year's worth of college. I didn't relapse but i did develop a peptic ulcer.


An hour ago, issues in the family caused me to almost snap. The issue got resolved by me but my nerves were kinda wrecked and even my body feels wrecked. I went to the store and bought a pack. I smoked 2 cigarettes within 40 minutes.


I no longer feel like smoking, I've calmed down-ish from the family issue.


I just hope that this is a minor, not major, setback and I'll continue bring cigarette free.


I'm not sure why I'm writing this. Maybe I'm just venting, maybe it's some sort of impulse, maybe I'm looking for some external insight from people who's been in a similar situation, maybe I'm a sympathy craving attention whore. I'm using maybe cuz i honestly have no idea at the moment.


I wish you all a good long life without smoking.


If I'm violating any of the subreddit rules, i apologise.


Cheers

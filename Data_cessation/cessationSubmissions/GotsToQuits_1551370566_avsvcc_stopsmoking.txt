Yet another attempt

New account. I've posted here before and failed miserably. Here's another attempt. Just started this because I don't have any cigarettes left and I don't want to buy anymore. 

The below is a reminder for myself as to why I need to quit:

I've had health issues which may/may not be related to smoking but as a smoker for 13 years every thing is related to smoking. 

Most importantly, I need to quit because I want to kiss my husband when I want to kiss him. I don't want to run to the loo brush my teeth, wash my hands, use lavender lotion to get rid of the smell and then kiss him. I miss being spontaneous.

It has taken me three attempts to even complete this post about wanting to quit smoking. It is ridiculous how I have not been able to quit ahead. I am strong-headed and stubborn and will take decisions and see them through even if no one is backing me up. But when it comes to my own health, I slack off.

The plan is to post here..in the comments or edit this post everytime I feel like a smoke for the 3 min distraction.

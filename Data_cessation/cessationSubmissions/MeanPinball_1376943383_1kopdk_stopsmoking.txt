Tossed em!

I must have had like 15 left. Went for a walk, grabbed my pack, and lit one up. My original plan was to just leave the pack somewhere. Thinking someone might find them and get some free smokes. But then I thought some kids or teens would find them, and I don't want that. So in the garbage they went.. Wish me luck guys. I don't need that shit in my lungs!

Oral health after quitting question

Hi everyone! I haven't had a cigarette in 9 days after smoking about a pack a day for 6 years. For maybe a week, my tongue has been feeling kind of funny. It feels almost like I burned it drinking too hot coffee and sometimes has a whitish/yellow slight coating on it. My throat also feels very dry. 

I started vaping again immediately after quitting, and I am using it very often to try to fight the urge for a cigarette. I've read that after quitting, your oral health should improve, but I feel worse than I did when I was smoking. 

Has anyone ever experienced something similar to this? Maybe my body reacting to having quit? Maybe I'm vaping too often? Any advice or suggestion would be helpful, I am worried about it. My family thinks it's nothing and I'm overreacting but I'm bothered by it. Thank you in advance!

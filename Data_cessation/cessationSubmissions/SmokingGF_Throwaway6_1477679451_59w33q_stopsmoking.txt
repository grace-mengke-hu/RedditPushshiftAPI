Pregnant girlfriend hasn't smoked cigarettes for 24 hours, hopefully its permanent

My girlfriend has stopped smoking cigarettes (After I showed her some information, images and videos about premature and disformed newborns) , and gone cold turkey. She used to smoke 2-3 cigs a day, but now only has one e-cigarette a day, and wants to stop by the end of the month. Any extra tips for helping her quit fully? She told me to take away her ID so she can't buy any cigs, as well as telling all her friends she was pregnant so they would try and stop her.

Thank you all for your advice, good luck everyone on quiting.

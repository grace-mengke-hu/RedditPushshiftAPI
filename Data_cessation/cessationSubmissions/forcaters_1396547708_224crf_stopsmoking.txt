Day 12! Any advise please about e cigs would be much appreciated.

Hello. I am on day 12, although I am using an e cig. My no smoking app prompted me to look here, post something and I thought I would also ask for some advise. I wondered if I am still actually a smoker, am I cheating myself and doing as much damage to my health as smoking cigs as I am using an e cig. I spoke with a stop smoking adviser today who was horrified that I was using an e cig. Are they as bad as a cig?

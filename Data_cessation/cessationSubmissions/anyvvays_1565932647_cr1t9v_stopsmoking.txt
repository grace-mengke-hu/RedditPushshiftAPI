Over 15 years of at least a cigarette a day- 3 weeks in and feeling great

I know- nothing different about this post. I consider myself a healthy, 30 year old guy, but a serious closet smoker for the past 10 years. I exercise and play soccer regularly.  
  
Finally it hit me...physically. Started waking up with my lungs hurting and couldn’t run on the field for more than 5 minutes without getting winded. I woke up 3 weeks ago and said enough is enough.  
  
It’s been tough, but I’ve been beating the cravings and to be honest, it’s about time.  It’s a shame that i waited until it began to affect my health and fitness, but never too late to quit. Thanks for reading all.

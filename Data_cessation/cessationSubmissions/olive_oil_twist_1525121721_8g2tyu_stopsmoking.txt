How to encourage my dad?

Hi guys! My dad recently came clean to me and said he hasn't smoked a cigarette in 3 weeks or so. He told me that he uses patches to curb the smoking, but he has the urge to go buy a pack. I've never smoked in my life, so I can't say I have personal empathy, because I don't know what cold turkey and tobacco withdrawals feel like. What can I do to help my dad to not smoke? How can I help him on his path to staying off cigarettes?

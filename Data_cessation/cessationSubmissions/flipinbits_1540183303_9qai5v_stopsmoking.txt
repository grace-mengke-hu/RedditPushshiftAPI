I should have just stopped years ago!

I’ve been trying to quit smoking for over 15 years which is almost as long as I’ve been a smoker. 6 months in to my most recent quit and I’m wondering what my life would look like if I had quit a decade ago.

Would I have had more energy to focus on getting in great shape in my 20s? How many potential relationships passed me by because I smelled like an ash tray? Was most of the anxiety, stress, and depression i felt in the last decade of my life just an unnecessary byproduct a nasty habit? Would my life look any different if I never picked that first cigarette? 

Now that I’ve broken nicotine’s spell on me I struggle to remember the reasons behind why I smoked in the first place. Why did it take so long for me to recognize the tangible damage it was doing? In hindsight it seems like such a dumb thing to do yourself. Why does this quit feel different than the last 30 some odd failed attempts? I feel like I’ve finally beat this!

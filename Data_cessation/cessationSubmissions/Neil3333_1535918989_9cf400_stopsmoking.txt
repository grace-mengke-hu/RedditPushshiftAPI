Biological clock gone haywire since quitting smoking.

I quit 9 days ago. For the last 7 days, I've been awake all night &amp; sleeping in the morning. Though it suits my work,this sudden change is quite disturbing. Before,I smoked to stay awake. Now,it seems that I need to smoke to sleep. What's happening?

Quit over 2 weeks ago, feels good and bad

Everybody quits one day, and after 13 years of smoking might as well be today..


I started smoking in high school due to peer pressure, thinking it's the cool thing to do when you're 17, I mean, I really thought to myself "what's more to it than blowing smoke? Drugs can't be really THAT addictive. As soon as it's not cool anymore, I'll stop". Little did I know that this drug will define my behavior for the coming 13 years and potentially for the rest of my life.

Two weeks ago my lungs stopped taking in air. I felt the air going in and out, but my lungs simply discarded it. I know that cannot have been possible or else I'd just be dead, but that's very much how it felt like. This night I couldn't sleep and this night was the last time I felt the taste of the cigarette and I swore to never do this to myself again.

The dumbest decision I made in my teen years needs to be undone. And I am done.

I hope no one here needs to have a bad experience with smoking before knowing it's time to quit.

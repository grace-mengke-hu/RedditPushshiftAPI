Endless loop of relapses

So I have been juuling/vaping for about half a year and since I’m 17 and can’t ask seniors to buy me pods cause of holidays I have started smoking. In my country you can buy cigarettes at age 16 but juul pods are only 18 plus. Now a month ago I decided to stop smoking. The first time I stopped I had intense craving and felt terribly depressed and couldn’t manage at all. I have tried to quit like 10 times and I never take it seriously. But because of my constant smoking breaks I barely get any withdrawals or cravings at all but I still end up buying a pack. I know I can quit but i just don’t take it seriously what should I do. I don’t find cigarettes pleasurable at all every time I smoke a cigarette after a break I always ask myself why the fuck am I doing this I really don’t know what to do.

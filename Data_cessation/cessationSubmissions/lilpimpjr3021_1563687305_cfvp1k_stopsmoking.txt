Love no smoking but donâ€™t know what to expect! Help pleas

Hey everyone! I just started my journey with no cigs. I never thought I could do it. Recently my aunt passed away and I promised her and myself I would try. Then I got a wheeze and was so scared! So needless to say I stoped and it has been 5 days so far. I am using a JUUL to help but I feel good. My wheeze is gone, but I still have a cough. So my questions are, is it ok to use a JUUL? Is it normal to still have a cough? What other health things should I be expecting while going threw this? A little about me I was smoking for 12 years about a pack a day and am 32 years old. 
I want to say this group is great and I admire you all! Also love the smoke free that suggested this chat room! I see others use it as well! So happy!

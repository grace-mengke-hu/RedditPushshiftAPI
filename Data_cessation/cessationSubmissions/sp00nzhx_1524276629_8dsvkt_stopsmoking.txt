Noon today made day 47. Monday makes seven weeks.

I didn't quite quit smoking (snus, or Scandinavian oral tobacco), but I couldn't find another community dedicated to wider nicotine addiction and quitting.

That said, hi everyone I'm new here, but as the title says today is day 47 and Monday marks seven weeks free.

Like many others the first few days were hell. I was irritable, anxious, everything set me off and I just wanted it. The feeling of burning in my lip was so familiar that I couldn't do without. But I did, and I did so cold turkey.

Every once in a while I feel a fleeting craving - talking about it actually makes it worse - but lately it's more for the feeling of something there in that spot. Fortunately they're short-lived.

Anyway, best of luck to you all, and if anyone wants to talk I'm always open.

EDIT: according to the flair bot, I'm bad at math.

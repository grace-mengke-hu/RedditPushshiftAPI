Feels like I might cough my lungs inside out...

I'm 2 weeks in and all I want is this damn cough to go. Studying for exams in the library is quite embarrassing, coughing every minute or so and disturbing everybody. Getting to sleep is also difficult as it seems to get worse around that time of day as well.

Find it really difficult to get a breath in sometimes as well, which worries me. Sometimes its continuous for the best part of a minute.

Smoked maybe 7ish a day for about 2 years and from what I've heard/read it should be starting to ease up now, but there doesn't seem to be any end in sight.

Despite all of this I'm battling the cravings quite well, even with the stress of exams on me. So for that, I'm proud :)

Just wanted to rant a little and gather your experiences on your cough. Did you have one? How bad was it? When did it clear up?

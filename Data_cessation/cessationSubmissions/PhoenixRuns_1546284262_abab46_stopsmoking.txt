Quick tip before New Year's!

DO NOT MAKE YOUR NEW YEARS RESOLUTION BE TO QUIT SMOKING!

(tl;dr at bottom)

Yeah, I said it. Why? New Year's resolutions have so much weight and expectation behind them, they're almost certain to fail. Research the stats on failed new year's resolutions if you don't believe me. Smoke on new year's eve, smoke new year's Day, smoke a week into 2019 or even a month! 

Create a strategy. Plan coping mechanisms. Get a support system in place (people in real life, social media, apps, etc). Decide if you're going all-in or quitting cigarettes but using NRT (nicotine replacement therapy). Pick a quit date. Mental prep for that day - are you going to taper down? Or just cut it off with a clear break? If you have a setback, are you going to keep smoking, or forgive yourself and refocus on the goal? What can you learn from previous quit attempts?

If you're using NRT - what method? Research pros and cons and expenses of each. For me, I use a vape...and have turned to vaping as a hobby. Unfortunately once you start collecting stuff you're not really saving money by not smoking, but I digress... It worked for me and thousands of other people too.

I smoked for 18 years or so, at least a pack a day, and for about 2 years I was smoking 1.5 - 2 packs per day. Haven't had a puff since October 5 2018 - currently 86 days. Last winter I had tried to quit (again) and failed (again) and had actually accepted that I was going to be a smoker until the day I died. I didn't think I'd ever be able to quit.

I did it. You can too. Just not on New Year's, ok?

 TL;DR: Be strategic. Plan for success. Forgive yourself for setbacks. Eyes on the endgame. You can and will quit smoking, just keep trying different methods. I did it. You can too.

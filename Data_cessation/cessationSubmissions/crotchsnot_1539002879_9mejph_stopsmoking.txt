Made it a week

I decided to quit on Saturday September 29th.  I bought some nicotine gum and have been following the directions. It has been super helpful. I don't really get cravings for cigarettes, but this weekend I went out with some friends and ended up bumming a couple smokes.  I didn't finish either of them and didn't particularly enjoy them, but it was a slip up, nonetheless. My girlfriend wasn't very happy about it, but she didn't give me too hard a time over it.  She just wants me to stick to it.

That week was the longest I have gone without a cigarette since my last attempt at quitting which was three years ago, I made it about six months.  My sister just had a baby, so now I'm an uncle.  I don't want to be the uncle that smokes.  No one else in my family smokes, and I am tired of being the one who has to sneak away at family functions to smoke only to be told how gross it is when I come back.

Back to gum and positive thinking.  I am very motivated to quit, I just need to stay the course.

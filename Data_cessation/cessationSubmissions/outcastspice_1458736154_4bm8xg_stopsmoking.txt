Looking for Advice & Coping mechanisms

My partner had been thinking about quitting for quite some time, and is now midway through week 3 of using the patch, no cigarettes at all since March 4. He was previously smoking between 1/2 to 1 pack a day.

I'm looking for advice for two things - (a) coping with social anxiety, and (b) focusing/re-focusing on work tasks.

In the past, going out for a smoke was a great way for him to get out of awkward situations, and I think the smoking would also calm him down/help him not feel anxious about the situation. Now that he's not smoking, it's really awkward to say "oh I'm just going out for a walk", especially if he's in a family or work situation where people might question why he wants to remove himself from the group. 

Re the work thing, he would smoke between tasks, both to focus on the new task and for un-interrupted time to think about what he wanted to do next. Now he doesn't have that either.

So, he can't be the only person to quit smoking and have these problems, but we're not sure how to resolve them. Suggestions would be appreciated, thank you.

There is more than one way to stop! (rant)

A little intro - I've been smoking for 25 years, a pack a day in the later years and began to feel the effects on my wellbeing in the last 5 years or so.
I'll try to make things brief for everyone's sake: 
- I've tried gum supplements - helped me for some time
- I've read the Allen Carr book and I've tried cold turkey but that didn't last long
What helped me stop completely - attention, unpopular opinion incoming - was vaping:
- for one month I was switching back and forth between smoking and vaping
- the next month or so I was vaping only
- now for about a month I'm not vaping anymore and not because I'm limiting myself but because I DO NOT WANT TO and on top of that the smell of smoke makes me disgusted

I've regained the smell, the sense of taste and the general wellbeing of being a nonsmoker and for someone who has been doing it for 25 years it feels like being born again.

Why the rant then - well I've been browsing this board while struggling and the general solution to the problem was:
/robotic voice
R-E-A-D A-L-L-E-N C-A-R-R
C-O-L-D T-U-R-K-E-Y

I absolutely hate the hivemind mentality and wonder if this will be my only post on reddit considering the nature of this site, but at least you'll have my input

Stay smoke free, people!

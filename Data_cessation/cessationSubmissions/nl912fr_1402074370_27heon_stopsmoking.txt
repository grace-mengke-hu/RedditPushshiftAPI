Stop smoking cravings

To anyone that have found a way to beat the smoking habits in the military: My bf joined the army a few months ago and from what I understand he was a casual/social smoker before joining. Being in the military, this habit became a daily problem and after discussing it with him, he realized the social benefits of smoking were not worth the harm and danger he's putting himself to. He's trying hard to resist to the cravings, he chews spits. He's telling me though that this will not solve the problem permanently. I can't blame him, in an environment where smoking is the norm, I told him to avoid such interactions. But I don't want him to prevent socializing during breaks, night outs, etc. Has anybody else found themselves in this situation? Any idea out there could help, thanks in advance!

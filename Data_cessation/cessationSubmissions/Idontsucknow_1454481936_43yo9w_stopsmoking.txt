I didn't cave...

...and I need a pat on the back from people who understand, please! I had a really bad week, and I don't know if it's because it was around the 3 week mark, but I came so fucking close to going and buying a pack (which I would have sat there and smashed in one sitting). I was having a bit of a panic attack from stress, but somehow got through it and managed to do a good day of work. I couldn't even get in to see my shrink until the next day, but I made it. This is the first time I have not given in when it's been that bad. 

You know that feeling you get when you wake up pissed off with yourself because you dreamed you were smoking? I had that feeling the whole next day even though I was clean, that's how convinced I was that I was going to do it. But I didn't...and now everything is good in the world again, and I finally got my 5km run time under 30 mins, so I'm pretty stoked. Yay me!

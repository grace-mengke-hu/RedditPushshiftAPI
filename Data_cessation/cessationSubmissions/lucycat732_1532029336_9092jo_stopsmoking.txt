200 Days!!

I am really proud of this accomplishment! I don't think about smoking nearly as much as I did a few months ago, and I can hang out around smokers without crazy cravings (though the cravings do pop up--they are just suppressed much easier). 

The encouragement and resources I found on this subreddit in the beginning of my quit journey helped immensely, and have set up a great foundation for my success. So thank y'all for that!!

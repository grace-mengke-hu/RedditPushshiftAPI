Everyday I wake up I feel it killing me

Father of 3 little ones. Life insurance would be invalidated if I was discovered. I have so much less energy. I cough constantly. I throw up in the morning sometimes. I feel sore in the evening even though I did not do much. I sweat after any light exertion, or if the temperature is simply above 74 degrees. But I still don't stop. I say I will every morning until that first cigarette.

Smoking is the biggest stressor and the biggest stress relief I have. I have a small business that is seemingly always on the edge of making it big or collapsing. I work constantly, juggle bills, and try to be a good dad and husband. Not matter how hard the day is that cigarette makes everything ok for a few minutes. Then I get that feeling like I will die before my 35th birthday.

But I have to stop. I keep imagining myself on my death bed thinking back on which failed attempt to quit would have saved my life. Is is this one? Or is it already too late?

It sounds insignificant but I have gone 24hours without a smoke. Maybe I can save my life today, unless this feeling I have had in my gut is right and I have already stupidly ruined everything and killed myself.



**Update:** Wow - thank you all. Wrote this mostly for myself expecting maybe 1 comment. Went out for the day with the family. Came back with the creeping thought of sneaking out to buy a pack... and then I saw all the responses and encouragement. Didn't cave in.

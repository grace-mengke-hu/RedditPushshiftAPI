Two Years. Amazing. I'll keep it short.

Quit smoking two years ago. Was a pack a day for about five years. Because of this community I was able to persevere through the temptation. Now I can't imagine smoking.

To those about to quit, I salute you. You can do it, and you'll be so thankful you did. To those who helped me quit... you probably saved my life in some way.

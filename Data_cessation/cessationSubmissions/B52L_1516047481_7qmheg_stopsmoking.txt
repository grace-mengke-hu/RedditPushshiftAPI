Made it through 24 hours. I feel awful

Yesterday was the day. I said goodbye, threw out my pack and cried tears of joy. I've been through the mental routine of quitting before but this is the first time I've ever taken physical action towards quitting and damn did it feel good. 

Here I am 24 hours later and that amazing feeling has totally gone. My brain is starting to tell me things like "just one more", "your lungs hurt because you need to smoke dummy" and countless other damaging thoughts. I'm super anxious and am starting to get scared again, which is what ultimately lead me to relapse each time I tried to previously quit. 

I can only assume this is all normal, but do you guys have any pointers for curbing these awful, manipulative thoughts? Sorry for the wall of text. Any help would be greatly appreciated. 

TL;DR: felt amazing when I decided to quit, that feeling is now replaced with fear and anxiety.

Reminded again that I love being a non smoker

I took last week off for the holiday but I ended up having to go into the office on Thursday: I am working on a project due next week with a big shot and it was the only day he could be in to work directly with me.

That morning I woke up feeling only slightly hungover despite staying up a little later and having a few drinks. My former / smoking self may have had a ripping headache.

I saw my train arriving as I approached the station and ran for it, up about 4 full flights to the platform. I just barely made it and was slightly winded but without the type of panting fatigue I'd experienced in the same situation in the past.

I work in an open office environment. When the big shot arrived he took the station next to mine, only 5-6 feet away without any cubicle partition. In the past I would be panicked about how I could go smoke without him noticing my disappearance or smelling anything when I returned. On Thursday I just worked right through no problem. I even finished a little early and ended up leaving around 3:30.

I also saved $10 just like every day since I quit.

Happy New Year, be strong and best of luck health and happiness to all you new quitters.

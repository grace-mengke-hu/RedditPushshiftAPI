5 years clean, and had a nightmare last night

The famous nightmare where you relapse in your dreams, only to wake up and be so happy it wasn't real.

The visuals were so intense, I could see myself in first-person smoking and putting the cig to my face, telling myself "I'll quit again soon... it's just a few puffs". 

I could even taste the tobacco in my mouth and the sensation of blowing it out my mouth.

Can't believe 5 years tobacco free and these dreams still happen. Shows you how powerful of an addiction it is.

**tobacco addiction is no joke. Good luck to y'all trying to quit.**

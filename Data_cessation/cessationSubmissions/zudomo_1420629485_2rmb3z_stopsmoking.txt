I just want to light up all 20 cigs at once

This has to be the worst craving I've had since i quit. I am so close to three weeks. I survived four nights of getting drunk/hammered and didn't smoke yet now is almost unbearable. I can't wait for this to pass.

**UPDATE**

So while I was craving a cig for like 6 straight hours, I ended up going out and drinking and **NOT** having a cig at all.

Thank you all for the support. I'm sure I would have caved if it wasn't for all your comments!!!!

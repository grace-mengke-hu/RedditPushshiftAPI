Day 12

It has taken me years to finally quit, I have tried cutting down, tried going for just a day, hour etc, but always went back to it. For whatever reason I am going through treatment for PTSD, my life has been hell, somehow I just knew that I just had to quit and too never go back, not one slip. So I didn't quite plan when, I just knew I had come to The day, the cravings have been there, oh boy have they, but finally my life is more valuable than a cigarette. I pray it stays that way

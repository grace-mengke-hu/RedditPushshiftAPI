This is usually the time where I give in and smoke!

I havent smoked in 23 days now and I'm feeling great. I do not get cravings, I'm much fitter and im generally happier without them. I'm 17 years old and am very into sport and it's going great without smoking. However, after a few weeks of not smoking I begin to feel like I've broken the cycle and that I can just have "one smoke" with my friends, which I've realized never helps me. What were some of your coping techniques to get it totally out of your mind? I'm just looking for some encouragement at this place and time. Thanks guys!

Quitting smoking and trying to keep my relationship together.

So I'm a 10 year plus, almost-a-pack-a-day smoker and my gf is the same, but she recently quit smoking (not long before we met a few months ago). Naturally, she wants me to quit too. And I'm all for it. The main problem is I get very bitchy and we will get into a fight and I will cave.   


Yesterday was the worst. It was her birthday, I had one cig on saturday mid-day (shhh, don't tell her) and so yesterday, I wasn't in the best mood. Anyway, we got into a fight while I was agitated and craving, and, of course, I made it bigger than it needed to be.  I want bore you with the details, so....  


Anyway, the fight lasted into the morning. It got really intense, I decided to leave and stay away for a few days. I'm going to give this solid shot for her, for me, and for a better future for us. I don't want to be a bad influence on her, and I know I will benefit greatly myself.   


I don't want cigarettes to control my life and make me lose one of the best things that's happened to me. So here I am. I'm only three hours in but the craving is already there (especially due to the situation) but I am cool with it.   


I won't fight the craving, I will embrace it and wait for it to subside.

Relapse after 40~ days smoke free...

So I went a whole 40 days without smoking - not a puff. Then, with the start of the school year (I'm in grad school) I bought a pack of cigarettes and then another etc. Out of nowhere! Anyone have any tips to get back on track? It was totally habit - walk in to TA a class, have a smoke before hand - that I hadn't had to deal with yet. Now, I feel like crap and as if there's really no point in trying to quit. 

I guess I'm just looking to vent, and get some feedback/advice on what people have done in a similar situation. Thanks!

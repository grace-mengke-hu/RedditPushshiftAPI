I quit smoking using chantix and It's been over a month and alcohol has little affect on me.

I even tried to space it out drinking once a week and I'd have to drink a lot to feel get a buzz. Anyone have this problem? Or had it and it went away? I don't smoke weed anymore because of the smoking aspect so it's the only vice I have left.

I am being induced in a few days, and I am so glad I don't have to worry about my smoking affecting my baby girl!

I can proudly say I quit, for my little peanut. And in just a few days the struggle and withdrawals I experienced earlier on will totally be worth it (not that quitting in itself isn't worth it, it totally is). 

There were so many people who could have made it easy for me to continue smoking by justifying it. Many said they smoked their whole pregnancy, others said it was good enough to just cut down. My own mother smoked a pack and a half a day when she was pregnant for me.
But I didn't listen to their reasoning, and I have been smoke free for so long I don't even crave it anymore.

When I first quit I said I'd probably go back to smoking once she's born, but that must have been the addiction still trying to lure me back in. A couple days left until induction and I have NO DESIRE whatsoever to start back up again!! üòÉ I'm so glad I'm not going to be losing my mind in the hospital room because I can't go out for a cigarette. Instead I will be enjoying every single moment with my baby girl ‚ù§Ô∏è

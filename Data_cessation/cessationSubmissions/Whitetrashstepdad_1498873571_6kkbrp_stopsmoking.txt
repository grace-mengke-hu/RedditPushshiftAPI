One week, baby

So the other week I made a post about how much I love to smoke when I drink. I got some honest answers which is what I needed to hear (I smoke when I drink because I don't want to quit bad enough). So I went out with my non-smoking work friends last Friday. All was well until one of them invited a personal friend, a smoker. Well, I had a few drinks in me, my inhibitions lowered, and I'll be honest, I bummed a cigarette as I didn't have any of my own. 

But I made it through the night on ONE FUCKING CIGARETTE. I didn't bum more. I didn't Uber to the gas station to buy my own pack. I didn't have the Uber driver stop at the gas station on the way home from the bar. I drank and only had ONE FUCKING CIGARETTE. 

So, this entire week, when I get home from work, instead of reaching for a beer and a cigarette (I still haven't bought any) I have made myself some food and gone on a bike ride instead. I come home from the bike ride worn out and not even thinking about cigs. 

Anyway, this evening marks one week cigarette-free. I know I have a long journey ahead, but my new evening routine is helping me a lot, and I plan to continue it. 

I love this sub and the honesty from people.

Been smoking cigs for a year and then...

I stopped. I cant really explain it but I didn't want to smoke anymore  so I thought I'd just try. Im suprised that I dont feel bad, in fact I feel great! Cigs make me feel sickly and I cant stand not being able to smell anymore. I crave but I can quell these feels with the occasional caigarillo. I also gave snus anouther shot and with some patience I dont even think about cigs. Considering switching to snuff if thats still availible to public. Your Thoughts on cigs, snus, snuf, and quitting appreciated! Sorry for the long winded post, it just feels good to vent. Good luck and happy trails.

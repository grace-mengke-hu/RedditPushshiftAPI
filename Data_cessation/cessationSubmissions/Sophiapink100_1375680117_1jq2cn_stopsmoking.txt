It is all I think about!

So I am day 4 into not smoking and this isn't the first attempt I have made to quit  

I am 22 and have been smoking for 9 years. 

I just want someone to reassure me that this constant thinking about smoking, fags, the smell etc will disappear eventually. 

Any tips aswell? Would really appreciate it. 

Thanks

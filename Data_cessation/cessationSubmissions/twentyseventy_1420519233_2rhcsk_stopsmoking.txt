To All the New Years Quitters Struggling...

**You can do it, seriously!**

After smoking for seven years, I quit cold turkey on October 7, 2013. I never thought that I would quit, I loved smoking and even thinking about quitting put me nearly into a panic attack.

But I did. 

* I learned how to drive without smoking and stayed quit.
* I got blackout drunk and stayed quit (work your way up to this one).
* My wife, whom I quit with, started smoking again... and I stayed quit! 

So, at least 3-4 times a week, my wife smokes while we're driving around in the car. 

* Could I have one? Sure. But I don't. 
* Will I buy her a pack at the gas station? Sure. And when she's ready to quit, I'll be there to help her.
* But I stayed quit. 

And you can, too. 

Let the numbers motivate you - each pack not smoked, each dollar not spent, each smoke-free day that ticks up on your flair is a victory.

If I can do it, you can too - I promise.

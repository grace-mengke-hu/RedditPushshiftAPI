Why am I addicted now but wasn't before?

I've always been a social smoker but never craved or smoked consistently enough through the past 12 years. There are years I didn't even recall cigarettes existed. Now I'm approaching 30 and like a switch got flipped... I can't stop. 

My top three suspects is that my behaviors and life situation generally predisposed me to addictions and I have depleted dopamine the past few years leading me into this, or that I've picked up smokes high in nicotine, or that it's a change because of age. 

I just never imagined myself in this situation. I used to be able to smoke a pack within few days and go months forgetting about it. Not so much anymore. What gives?

I'm on Day Five, and I Feel Great! I do Have Some Questions Though.

Hello everyone,

I had been smoking for 9 years, tried to quit maybe twice? First time I tried an ecigarette, and the second time cold turkey. Neither were very effective for various reasons. 

I've read a little bit of the Allen Carr book and decided to quit before I got to the end. The first two days were hell, but I have a wonderful support group and I feel far more mentally and emotionally prepared for this round. I've pledged to not drink for the first 100 days of no smoking. 

Other than cravings, I've been experiencing the other side effects of quitting. Acne, stomach problems, and the occasional nosebleed. I was wondering if anyone had any advice on how to speed up the detoxing process? 

I don't want to do anything crazy like go on a juice cleanse. I know my bodies' equilibrium is way out of whack since it's been deprived of the poisons it's used to. I just want to know if there is anything gentle I can do to help it along. 

I'm already taking a daily multivitamin. I've stopped drinking coffee (huge trigger) and was thinking of switching to green tea. 

I was thinking of calling my insurance's advice nurse and asking for other tips, but if I could get some advice from ex smokers that would be way helpful! 

Thank you all so much! 

Oh, and as a bonus, I wanna share some of the awesome things I've experienced thus far:
Breathing! Full, deep, wonderful gulps of air! It's way better than I could have imagined! Also, my head is less foggy. I'm way more focused at work now, and can be more efficient since half of my brain isn't thinking of when I can get my next nicfix.

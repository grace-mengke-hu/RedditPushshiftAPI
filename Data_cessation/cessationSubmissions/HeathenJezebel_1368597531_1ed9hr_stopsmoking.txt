131 days ago, I quit smoking cigarettes, cold turkey. No bullshit. You can do it if you want it.

Good luck. It sucks -- but it's so worth it.

EDIT: I didn't go this route, but I wish I would have. There is a way to get your fix without inhaling nicotine (the addictive shit), or all of the terrible additives. Check around your local smoke shops for herbal cigarettes. I feel like I should note that inhaling anything isn't good for your lungs -- however, you can puff on these if you're drinking or whatever and not suffer any ill effects, such as physical addiction. They are literally non addictive cigarettes, with astronomically less bullshit in them. I feel that these are the **best** alternative next to cold turkey. Nicotine patches/gum/e-cigs/whatever don't seem to do the trick, because you're still addicted to nicotine. You simply break the habit of inhaling smoke, but not of being addicted.

Insomnia

Hi guys. Iâ€™ve been a smoker on and off for over 30 years. Stopped on the 28/9 
Are there any helpful hints on the insomnia you get from quitting smoking? - it seems to be getting worse as the days go on. Torture in fact. 
Thank you in advance for any experiences and advice you can give me x

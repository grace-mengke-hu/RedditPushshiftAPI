Frustration is real

48 hours ago I smoked my last cigarette and I can't wait for it to get better. I have trouble focussing at work, I developed an intense hate towards one of my coworkers (even the sound of him breathing is annoying to me), and have been eating quite a lot (I just had two lunches). I really have no idea why I did this to myself again. Really, everytime I quit, the first days are just filled with horror. This motivates me to keep going. Never again.

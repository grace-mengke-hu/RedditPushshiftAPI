Libido Out of Control After 10 Days

Hey everyone, first time poster here. For some background, I've been smoking on and off for over a decade. The breakdown:

I've quit for as long as five years and smoked for as long as two, and vaped for two over years. I quit ten days ago after smoking solely cigarettes, about a pack a day, for six months. 

Like the title says, my sex drive ran over a turbo boost about a week after I quit. I don't have a girlfriend but suffice to say I've been a lot more responsive and active than usual. I know all the stuff about how smoking messes with circulation. But the majority of posts I've seen have been about a depressing nose dive of libido. Has anyone else experienced it the other way?

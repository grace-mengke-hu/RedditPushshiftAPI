Using marijuana to beat Nicotine cravings

Well, the title is basically what I've been doing. I know it's not really the best practice but I'm sick of ciggarretes and the quantity I smoked them in.  out of the blue last week I decided to quit smoking ciggarretes and I actually made it to day 5 (yesterday) without a ciggarrette. But then I nicked one from my moms pack yesterday :( really disappointed and honestly really glad the physical symptoms havent come back, even though the psychological cravings got worse with my relapse. I WILL NOT SMOKE WITH YOU TODAY, OR EVER. unless its weed ;)

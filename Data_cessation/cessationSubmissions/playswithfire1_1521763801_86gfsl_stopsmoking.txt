A shower thought regarding tobacco companies

Every one of us thrift shopping, hitchhiking, status quo bashing, dumpster diving chicken-mcnobodies will sit there smoking a cigarette and deride all the consumer slaves for trampling each other to get their greasy paws on the newest iPhone. We say "you all buy the newest clothes and meanwhile the ceos get fat and rich, you silly sheeple!" Meanwhile we consume tobacco at an alarming rate because we are so wise and world weary. Have any of us bought local cigarets? Do we buy fair trade chew? Do we research which company pays its plant workers a living wage? No, we scrounge free tomatoes and say fuck the suits while we funnel billions into their pockets every day at the 7-11. We are just as much slaves as the heathenish Black Friday shoppers. Quitting smoking, be it a small one, is a revolutionary act of a sort.

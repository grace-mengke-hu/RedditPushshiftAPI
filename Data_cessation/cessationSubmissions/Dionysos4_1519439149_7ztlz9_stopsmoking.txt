Can’t find adequate stress relief!

Hi guys,

I am 5 months into my second quit attempt (my first attempt lasted for 2-ish years). I’m concerned that I am starting to approach a relapse. Stress is overwhelming me and I have no way to cope. It’s what sank my first attempt, and it’s becoming a major factor again. What techniques / resources can you recommend to help deal with extreme build-ups of stress?

Thanks

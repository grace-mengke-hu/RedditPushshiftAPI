Cols turkey during a period of stress?

Hi all! 

So I've been wanting to stop for a while but as a student during their mid-year exams my stress is currently off the charts and made it difficult. However, as someone who used to be incredibly active, seeing myself turn lazy and unmotivated to exercise has started to bring my mood down and I need to quit. My body is currently a tad run down as well from being overworked and I feel cigs aren't helping.

This would all be fine but again with exams coming up I'm concerned I won't be able to focus due to withdrawl. Does anyone know how bad this would be or if it's okay to go ahead? Sure I could wait a month but I feel a strong compulsion to do it now.

For reference I smoke between 5 and 10 cigarettes a day.

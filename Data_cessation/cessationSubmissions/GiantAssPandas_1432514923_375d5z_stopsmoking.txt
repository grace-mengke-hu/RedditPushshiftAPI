Cigarettes don't even phase me at this point.

I just checked my counter and I have officially been 239 days without a cigarette, and it completely blows my mind.  I remember when I first started the cold turkey quit it was such a struggle.  I had to take it craving by craving, and now I don't even think about cigarettes.  I mean occasionally I'll crave one if I'm drinking or watching a TV show and someone is smoking, but that state of mind does not linger.  I urge anyone who is thinking about quitting cigarettes to do it.  Just make it one week.  You can fucking do it, and once you do it I PROMISE you after a couple weeks it'll be so much easier in the quitting process.  Quitting cigarettes was one of the hardest things I ever did in my life, but once you stop you realize how ridiculous of habit it actually is.  Keep on turning down that smoke people! I BELIEVE!!!!

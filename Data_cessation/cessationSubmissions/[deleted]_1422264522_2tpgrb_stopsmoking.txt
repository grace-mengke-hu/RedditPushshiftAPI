Smokers will hate me for this but... HUGE LIFE ALTERING SPOILER ALERT!

Smoking gives you a yellow (or even black after long periods) tongue, make sure to brush daily and buy mouth wash. After the first brushing of blackness if you didn't know, it becomes much easier to remove but still takes some elbow grease. Good luck!

day 2 quitting smoking is tough

My mantra to my friends for the past day: Quitting smoking is tough. Shit. I want a smoke. Anxiety high. Slight headaches gone thankfully, I had those yesterday. Man I am tired and unmotivated though. Jesus I can't get over how tired I am. I don't think I got much sleep kept having dreams then waking up to my heart pounding. Dumb. At least they say after one more day the madness will die down.

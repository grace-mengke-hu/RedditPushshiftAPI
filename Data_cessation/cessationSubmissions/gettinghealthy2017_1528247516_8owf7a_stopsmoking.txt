finally ready!!!

i let my anxiety get the worst of me last night and i smoked today. very minimally through the day and then tonight i smoked 7 cigarettes in a row, the last of my pack. came inside and promptly threw up. as gross as that is, i think that was exactly what i needed. i feel so gross and confident in tomorrow’s quit. or tonight’s i guess, since i live in an apartment and don’t plan on going back downstairs tonight. i’m actually so nauseous i’m not even going for the ecig i usually use inside. my mom is also quitting tomorrow so i’m glad i’ll have her support too. have my patch &amp; lozenges &amp; lollipops out and ready for tomorrow!!!

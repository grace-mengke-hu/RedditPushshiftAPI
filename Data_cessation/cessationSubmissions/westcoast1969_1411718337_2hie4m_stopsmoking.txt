Day 5 - feeling crap ðŸ˜ž

This is the 2nd in a year I've quit. I fell down last time by thinking I'd be ok having just the 1. Just the 1 turned into 2, then 3 and within 3days I was back to smoking full time and smoking more than I did before I'd quit. 
This time there will be no "just the 1". I've got through day 3 which was a bitch of a day and I'm feeling very pleased that I've got to day 5 and am continually telling myself I don't need a smoke. However today I am feeling rough - sore throat, cough and a mouth full of ulcers. I hate being ill and I admit I'm the worlds worse patient. So have taken the day off work, set myself up in front of the TV to wallow in my own self pity with just a hint of pride knowing I'm nearly through my first week.

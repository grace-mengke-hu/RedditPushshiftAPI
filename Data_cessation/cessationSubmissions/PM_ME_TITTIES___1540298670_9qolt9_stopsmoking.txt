First 48 hours is done, I caved and bought a pack but I havent touched it yet.

1 pack a day for 4 years here. I just caved and bought a pack together with some chewing gum (just normal gym). Since I got home 2 hours ago I haven’t touched the pack, just been staring at it. I’ve chewing gum since I came home. I want to smoke 1 so bad, but the gum and fresh breath keeps me away from it. I wanna throw the cigarettes out but I can’t. Fuck.

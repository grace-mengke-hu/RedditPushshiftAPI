Last night was first real craving challenge...

It's actually been surprisingly comfortable to quit so far, I don't really know why.

Last night was tough, though. At home in the evening watching TV, couldn't stop thinking "your housemate has cigarettes, it'd be OK to have one...you've gone ten days".

That's always been my downfall in the past - the cigarette to "reward" myself for a period of not smoking.

...not last night, though. Resisted the urge, drank water instead, and went to bed. :)

I'm working to become addicted to not smoking!

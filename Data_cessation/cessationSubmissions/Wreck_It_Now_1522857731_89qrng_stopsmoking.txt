Day 3 wowza is my body itching

Hi Reddit, nicotine addict here. I love nicotine, however my brain loves nicotine more than I love Nicotine. My brain wants me to think it is the Apex of relaxation, physical achievement, etc. when in reality and actuallity it sucks.

I would always joke that if anyone needed advice on quitting come to me, I have done it many times. Day 3 is the hardest. It has always been the hardest.

The brain plays tricks on you because its way smarter than you. Its job is to figure out how it can get you to get more of what it wants.

For me, recognizing the difference between the addiction talking and myself talking is a big step towards recovery, one you have to remind yourself of.

Day 3 sucks for my addiction but is great for my health body and mind.

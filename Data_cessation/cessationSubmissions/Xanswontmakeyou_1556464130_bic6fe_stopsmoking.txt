I haven’t had a smoke in 9 months. Last night I had a few puffs of a cigarette to see if the cravings have gone away (dumb, I know)

The good news is that I **absolutely** hated it, said to myself “I’m SO glad I quit” and I feel like I made that nagging voice in the back of my head saying “don’t you miss cigarettes?!? Maybe you should start smoking again...?” Go away. 

I do feel bad I tripped myself up and broke a 9 month streak, but I’m also kinda glad because it confirmed the fact that I’m done. I don’t want to keep counting how many days it’s been since my last smoke anyways, I don’t want to even think about it. I’m just done and the desire to smoke, the nagging “what if” are just gone.

Quitting Two Vices at a Time: Gaming and Smoking. Advice?

Day 4: Boy is this flipping difficult! I try to fill time up, but my attention span just laughs back at me when I try to do so.

This is probably my 10th attempt at kicking the butt and Nth at quitting games -- been at it for half a year now (ever since I began lifting consistently). I denied this being an addiction for a year, and have attempted to quit ever after. Longest I've gone is a month.

Annoyed, bored, unmotivated do not even begin to describe my state now.

Is this withdrawal from gaming or smoking? Both? Am I trying to be Hercules while I really only have the strength of the wimpy kid? Denying myself too much dopamine?

Eh, damn it. I'm doing this anyway.

This may be day one.

Damn damn damn. Last week end was just a try and failed. My dustbin was full of butts. I failed and buy a pack on saturday. I have been watching many documentaries about the tobacco industry. I hate it.

So I made everything clear. I emptied all trash a few hours ago. Not even on cigarette at home. And damn. I am craving for it. With a past linked to many other drugs ... It just make me laught to think about tv shows telling about how bad is any other drug while smoking is just so socialy acceptable.
So it's 4am. I just can't sleep and I know it will be last for another day. I'll have a drink.
That's all folks. [Insert looney tunes song here]


Insert awsome music there : [Rone - Parade](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdR5iFfNCI4)

Let's say I will listen to that loudly in loop until I forget about the shit I want

[Edit2]


Let's update this shit. Yesterday, i found some butts in some lost dustbin. It sounds like a "mini-Fail".

I bough a pack today. But. Damn. I don't know what to do. For now. I haven't smoked one already. I am hesitating with throwing it litteraly by the window, keeping the opportunity to smoke maybe one, who knows.

Anyway, I am drunk. I want one, but my will is stronger when my blood is filled up with vodka. - Ok, this does not sound that much great, I have to admit -

So, here is more music : [Professor Elemental - Fighting Trousers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iRTB-FTMdk)

That's all folks.

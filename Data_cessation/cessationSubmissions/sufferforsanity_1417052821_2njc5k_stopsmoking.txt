Snakes and Ladders

Hey /r/stopsmoking,

Does anyone else feel like they're playing a game of snakes and ladders, except there are no ladders, only snakes?  The snakes are spaced a little further apart as you move up the board, but they're still there, waiting to suck you back down.

I'm determined to quit but have stepped on a snake called 'social cigarettes' THREE times now (idiocy I know).  SNAKE.....BOOM.......DOWN-YOU-GO.  

I should be in the final 3rd by now.  You know, the point where you get through worst of it and have your first couple of days of forgetting you smoked.  I could have been there and back TWICE by now but here I am.  Day 11.  Again. LOL.

I got through last weekend and feel good.  There's hope for us all yet.  One more weekend smoke free and I'll be in the clear.  Just in time to NOT secretly smoke around family over Christmas. 

Listen up nicotine, YOU LITTLE BITCH, not this weekend mmmm-k?

Thanks for listening to my little rant, the end.

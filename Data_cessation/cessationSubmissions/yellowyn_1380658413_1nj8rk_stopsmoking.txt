How my boyfriend helped me quit

I smoked for 11 years, starting at 16. I thought it was hopeless. I'd read and re-read different books, went to hypnosis, bought the e-cig, patches, gum, everything. I didn't understand why I couldn't stop and was depressed at the thought of never being able to quit.

One night I had an idea. My boyfriend and I did a role play. I played The Addict. I said all the stuff that went on in my brain to keep me smoking. I had to convince him to smoke. My boyfriend played Wise Yellowyn. He would respond to The Addict the way a never-smoker/non-smoker would (this was easy for him as he'd never smoked).



Observations

* Actually articulating to another human being the reasons to smoke weakened their persuasiveness. A lot of their power was gone. The reasons to smoke only *felt* powerful as long as they were subconscious.

* His reactions were unexpected (in a good way). One of my arguments was "if I don't smoke, I won't be able to deal with the problems of life" and his response started with "That's retarded." Point blank. No mincing words. It was jarring, because this was the biggest argument The Addict had. He then went one to list reasons why it's untrue, which was helpful. But the most helpful was that initial reaction, because it clued me into how off-base / irrational The Addict had to be.

* It was hard at times because I was embarrassed by The Addict's thoughts. I fought the temptation to leave anything out though. I think that was important, in retrospect.

This ended up being incredibly effective. We role-played once more a week later to re-inforce, and since then it's been smooth sailing. It hasn't been hard and I'm very grateful.

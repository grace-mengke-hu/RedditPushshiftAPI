Starting to become repulsed by smoking.

The first few weeks were really tough, went cold turkey and slipped up a few times (especially when I'd been drinking). My flatmates smoke and I'm starting to hate the smell of their second hand smoke. I don't know when this started, but it makes life easier that's for sure. I'll get a bit of a craving when I'm out at a bar, but as soon as I go outside with the others to smoke, I'll be put off by the smell. Hope it stays that way. 

Anyone else experienced this?

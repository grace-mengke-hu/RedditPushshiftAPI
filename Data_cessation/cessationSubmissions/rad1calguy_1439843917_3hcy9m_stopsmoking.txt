So it begins...my journey as a permanant non-smoker!

And I couldn't be more exited! I just finished Allen Carr's 'Easyway to Quit Smoking' about 15 minutes ago, even going so far as to smoke my final cigarette when cued to by the book. I couldn't be more excited, and this time I'm positive I'm going to remain a non-smoker for the rest of my life. 

I did a few things in advance to make this attempt more than an attempt, but a final resolution.

a) I hate smoking on hot days more than any other time, and it just so happens to be one of the hottest days of the summer. Easy choice!

b) I'm got a few days off before starting a new job! Wrapping up the excitement at that prospect with the excitement of quitting was the right call. Life, all around, just feels full of new possibilites.

c) About three months ago I began getting really serious about fitness. I've been dilligently working through the Couch to 5k running program, but slowly. I've done each of the first three weeks three or four times, and the first day of the fourth week once. For those unaware of the program, it's an interval training that builds one's capacity to run distances. The week I'm currently on has 3 minutes of running/90 seconds of walking/5 minutes of running/3 minutes of walking repeated twice. It's rough. Running while still a smoker was always hard, but week four has been the hardest. Now I get to couple the exhilaration of making such huge progress on my fitness while I feel the fast-coming effects of ceasing to be a smoker! So exciting!

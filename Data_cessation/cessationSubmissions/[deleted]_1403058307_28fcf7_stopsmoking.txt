So, 16 days ago I posted about struggling to quit...

15 days ago I started listening to the audio version of Allen Carr's book.  I've never been one for self-help gurus or anything like that, but I can say that there's something about the way Allen Carr presents his case that just clicked with me.  I haven't smoked in over two weeks.  I haven't felt any desire to do so either.  This is the first time I've ever quit (after smoking for 20 years, since I was 12 years old) where I didn't feel like I've "given up" on something.  The change in my perspective on smoking is really something different and completely unexpected.

I've been around friends who were smoking, I've been out drinking, I've used drugs, driven long distances (all of which have historically been triggers to smoke) and it's barely even a thought.  I haven't been counting the time since my last cigarette, and I really feel free of it.  The only reason I knew it'd been over two weeks is because I had to look at my last post to see how long ago I'd made it...  Feeling great and am gonna keep it up!

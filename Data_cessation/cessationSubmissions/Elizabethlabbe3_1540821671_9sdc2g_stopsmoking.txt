First time reddit user

I set my quit date for Friday at 10pm....not sure how much feedback I'll get, but any encouragement will help. I'm still not sure I want to quit, but I at least need to make an attempt. I have 4 days to move from contemplation to action. HELP!!!!! 
(I thrive off of encouragement, support, and recognition)

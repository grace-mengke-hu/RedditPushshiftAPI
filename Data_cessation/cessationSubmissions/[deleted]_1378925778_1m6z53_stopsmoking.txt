Things I don't have to do as a non-smoker:

* hurry home to have a cigarette after work 
* choose where to go for a drink based on whether or not there is a patio for me to smoke on
* feel guilty about smoking around my non-smoking friends
* panic when my pack starts to get low at the end of the night
* only half enjoy a meal because I'm itching for the cigarette that comes afterwards 

What about you?

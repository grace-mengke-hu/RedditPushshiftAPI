Cytisine, Tabex?

Has anyone here tried Cytisine (Tabex)? 

If you did successfully, how did you dose it? 

Did you follow the prescription? 

Did it have any effect on your cognitive functions?   


The last few times when I quit I was next to unable to function at all. I had a foggy mind that made it next to impossible to concentrate and be productive at all. Since Cytisine is also discussed and used as a nootropic and genereally used for smoking cessation I am hoping that it might make the withdrawal a bit milder.

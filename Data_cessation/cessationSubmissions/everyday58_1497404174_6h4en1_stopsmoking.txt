Really struggling

In the past few weeks I get 5 days, then 3 days then two days then a couple of days. Each time less and less. I am normally a pack a day smoker trying to quit. I've read Allen Carr's book the easy way. I've listened to Jason Vales app, pretty much the easy way too. Then I got Allen's app. It's about the illusion behind all our reasons of why we smoke. If we can see through our illusions, we can quit easily. That the real reason we smoke is drug addiction. The only reason we smoke is to stop the withdrawal pangs caused by the previous cigarette. So we are actually in constant withdrawal and the only way to end this madness is to stop smoking. There's of course more to it, but I am struggling. 

I don't want to stop trying, because the first time I quit recently, the withdrawal was so intense. Over the years I had developed such a bad cough, I never want that to return again. I'm tired of living with the fears of contracting a terrible disease. As it is, I don't know if I have as I'm too afraid to go to the doctor. I hate smoking, yet I want to have another. The stress of smoking was awful and the new stress of trying to quit is even worse. The idea of watching one of these tapes again has me close to tears. The combination has sent me to bed tonight early as I just want to turn it off completely. Instead I thought I would write and reach out to this community of people trying to quit like me and to those that have already quit. The struggle is real.

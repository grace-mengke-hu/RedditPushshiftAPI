I started smoking at 9 years old

I'm 26 now, and when I was pregnant with my first child I cut down to 1 cigarette a day, same with my second child.
But, I always picked it back up to being a pack a day smoker.
I'm now pregnant with number 3 (just found out) and I've decide I need to just quit cold turkey!

My husband has been 100% nicotine free for 6 months, and I am so proud of him. I feel incredibly guilty that I've continued to smoke, even though we agreed to do it together. It's always a terrifying thought to me to quit, because it's been a part of my life for so long. But, I'm not feeling healthy any more and I haven't for so long, I can't run with my kids the way I want to, I spend so much time sitting and smoking and it's ridiculous. They all deserve better from me, and I deserve better from myself.

I just dropped my last 10 smokes into a bottle of water and shook them up, tossed every lighter (but one for candles) that I've collected, and I'll be washing everything that smells like smoke tonight.

I've been trying to hype myself up to do this for weeks now, and it's very much so time.

So wish me luck! I need to do this.

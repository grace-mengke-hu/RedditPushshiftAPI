Anyone has a genuine way to get whiter teeth after having quit ?

Just wanted to ask you guys if you already tried womething? I just don't want to spend all of my money on sh** that isn't going to work.

My teeth are pretty yellow and i just wanted to get them whiter now that i have quit for 6 months. 

Thanks

**Edit  : Thank you all guys!**

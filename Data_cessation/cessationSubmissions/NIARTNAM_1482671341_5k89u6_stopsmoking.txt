1613 days until I had another cigarette again.

It was only about 1/3 of a Marlboro light. I feel shamed and guilty because it has been SO long since i actually put my lips on a lit cigarette. (Marlboro). I have had cigars or blunts or cigarillos but the 1600+ days without a cigarette reference in my mind hit me. Been doin great since I subbed to this subreddit tho! no hope is lost.

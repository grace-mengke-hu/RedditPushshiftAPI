How I stopped.

I was dating someone who will be a smoker all her life. A woman who is constantly being enabled by everyone around her, she started enabling me and vice versa.

Since we broke up, I decided that my health is more important, and quit. The breakup was two months ago and I quit last week. Cold turkey. Not a craving, no vaping, patches or none of that crap.

What's the moral of the story? If you want to quit, and I mean REALLY want to quit, just do it. No excuses. You have the willpower to succeed.

Canker sores

I've smoked between a pack and a pack and a half a day for 30 years. 

I've tried to quit five times, and each of those times I went back to the cigs because of canker sores. I know that sounds crazy given the alternative, but it's difficult to express how bad they are. 

I'm talking 30 or 40 sores all over my mouth, on my tonsils, and down my throat, some of them half an inch across. I can't eat, kiss, smile, have problems swallowing, and eventually I can't speak. If I smoke a couple cigarettes, the next morning they're almost all gone.

I've been to my GP about it, and she was no use at all. She also suggested it was psychosomatic, even though the first time I tried to quit I had no idea there was a link between nicotine withdrawal and canker sores, but despite this after a week I was incapacitated with them, and I had blood coming out of the corners of my mouth.

I've tried steroid ointment (useless), mouthwash (useless), local anesthetic ointment (useless), rinsing with salt (useless and unnecessarily painful). 

So now I'm quitting again, and sure enough my mouth is growing a crop of nasty painful sores. They're already on the insides of my lips and the base of my tongue and the insides of my cheeks, and I guess they're going to get worse. This time I want to push through the pain but it's terrible.

First, I just wanted to vent to people who might understand.

Second, I want to ask others who got them how long until they went away. 

Third, does anyone have any folk remedies? I'll try anything at this point. 

Thanks.

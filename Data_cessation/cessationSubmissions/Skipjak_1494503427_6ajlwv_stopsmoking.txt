How to handle triggers?

I quit succesfully for three months earlier this year, but ever since I first smoked again I'm really having trouble staying off cigarettes. 

Nicotine withdrawal isn't the problem here, psychological triggers are. I can go for two weeks without smoking, then one day decide to smoke a cigarette after being triggered. I have observed myself whenever I slipped and concluded that these are my biggest triggers:

1. Bonding with a smoker.
My job involves alot of sitting outside, shooting the shit with collegues. I get to know new collegue's every day (big company, big pool of contractors), many of whom are smokers. I'm finding it hard to bond with these smoking collegaues without bumming a smoke from them. I know it's stupid. I don't want to impress them by showing 'Hey, I smoke too!' or anything. It's just... what I'm used to. 
This one is very strong. I will leave for work, not in withdrawal, and say to myself: I will not ask for cigarettes, I quit smoking. Then I see someone smoking, and immediately ask if I could bum one. This seems to be stronger then myself, as if I don't have a say in it. 

How do I deal with these situations? I have tried bringing gum to keep my mouth busy, bringing a book to read instead of chat with smokers, but to no avail. I will ask for a smoke if I get the chance.

2. Seeing attractive women smoke.
Something about seeing them smoke makes them so tempting. Young, healthy looking women smoking makes it seem rather harmless. Ofcourse I know that's not the case, but that seems to be what my brain is telling me.
I have also discovered a strange correlation between arousal and cigarette cravings. I get sexually aroused whenever I've decided to slip up and smoke, ans vice versa. What's the deal here?

Feel free to discusess triggers like these and how to handle them here.

Just realized it's been over one year

A year ago I quit smoking cigarettes. I had the flu and didn't smoke for a week, when I was feeling better I picked up an electronic cigarette. I used a disposable Blu for a couple weeks and got into vaping. I started vaping 18mg nicotine I am now down to 6mg and considering dropping to 3mg or 0 because nicotine is starting to make me nauseous.

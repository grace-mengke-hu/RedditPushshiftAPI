45 days smoke free, but missing smoking! And I hate that!

So happy to have quit smoking, but still having cravings, fantasies of smoking again. 25 year pack a day habit. Taking Chantix it ha e been off the patch/nicotine free for 3 weeks. 45 days no smokes.
I donâ€™t want to lapse-  not an option.
Anybody have any experience with this? When do the cravings stop?

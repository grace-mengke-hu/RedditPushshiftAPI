A few days of misery for a lifetime of freedom

I was just thinking to myself, as someone who has attempted to quit many times - what is a few days (maybe even a couple of weeks) of misery, compared to a lifetime of freedom and better living? 
I say this as someone who's currently smoking and drinking, who needs to quit both. I've read Carr's book and have eradicated the "benefits" of smoking but still focus on the negative withdrawals. 
Regardless of this, I will try to focus on the bigger picture. It is hard for an addict in withdrawal to think of much other than ending the misery of withdrawal, but I , and we should focus on the short term misery for a lifetime of freedom

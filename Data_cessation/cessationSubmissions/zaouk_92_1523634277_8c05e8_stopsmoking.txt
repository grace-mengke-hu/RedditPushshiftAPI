Alright, I just did something super dumb

Day 3 now. Just bought a pack because the idea of not having any with me was killing me. It’s been 2 hours since I bought it, still haven’t smoke one yet. The funny thing is I have one unlit in my mouth for a while now, and I can’t get myself to light it. This shit is getting ridiculous!

Quitting cold turkey as of today

I've done this about 3 or 4 times in the past, lasted up to 3 months before stupidly getting caught by the "just one won't hurt" attitude".

It's 10am where I am right now. I've got work to go to. I won't get my morning smoke, or my break at work smoke, or my after work smoke, or my after dinner smoke, or my evening smokes. 

Just typing the word smoke seems to tinge the cravings. But I will survive. 

The first couple week's are always the most difficult. A successful method for me has been to place as many obstacles between yourself and the means to get tobacco as possible.

Like today, my first day cold turkey. I'm not taking my wallet with me when I go to work. Then even if I decide I want to stop by a garage and buy a pack, I literally won't be able to. I'm not going back to my flat tonight until I'm tired enough for sleep. 

Also, when it comes to counting the days of being smoke free, I find it very useful to do so in the jungle that is the first couple weeks. Take each day in isolation though. Don't think "Only day 2! ONLY DAY 2!?", but instead when you wake up think of your day like a level in an old game boy mario game. It's just about getting to the end, i.e. to bed time in 12-15 hours. 

That's the way I've done it in the past, and it has always been successful. This time I have to be completely intolerant of smoking even months after. I'll update here if anyone wants to read. Or if anyone wants to join me in making it day 1.

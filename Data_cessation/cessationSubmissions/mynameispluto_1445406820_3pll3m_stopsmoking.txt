After my first 7 days of quitting, I went to light up a smoke - something amazing happened

Decided to quit smoking last week after about 5 years of smoking nearly a pack a day. Well, I got in a fight with my girl today, and had the urge to smoke, thinking "just one" wouldn't hurt. I went to the gas station, bought a pack of smokes - took one short hit - and oh my god, it was DISGUSTING. My lungs tightened up instantly and I coughed out whatever tiny bit of smoke made it past my tips into my lungs.

In that moment, I realized how cigarettes had controlled my life, even made me to believe they tasted and smelled good. What the FUCK was I thinking?

I immediately put out the smoke.

I'm not going to reset my badge because in this moment (which I could barely manage to inhale anyway), I saw a beacon of light - of truth - I'm not a smoker anymore.

Fuck you, cigarettes. Fuck you.

7 days clean. Is the hard part over?

After 4 years of smoking, I finally went cold turkey and I'm now 7 days without cigarettes.

I've got to the point where my brain "nags" me about smoking, every couple of hours.

At what stage did this go away for you guys? Or does it stick around for months/years?

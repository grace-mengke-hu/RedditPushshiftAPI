I think this is a good sign

I had my last 'offical' cigarette 6 days ago after 10 years of smoking, and have been using just a vape since. 
About a half hour ago I drove to the store, bought a pack, came home and smoked one.  
It was horrible. It didnt feel right.....in a way i cant put my finger on. Better yet, the after-taste is absolutley atrocious.  
That was definitley my last cigarette ever, and 100% wasting $5 on a pack just to find that out.  
So, I think thats a good sign for me truely quitting.

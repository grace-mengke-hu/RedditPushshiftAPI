Relearning

So I smoked for 44 years. I see now it is not only a matter of not smoking but of learning how to cope with emotions without the crutch I used for....44 years.  Learning how to handle sadness, excitement, anger, disappointment, boredom, breaks, etc.   What a ride this is.  I love being able to breathe!  And smelling good.

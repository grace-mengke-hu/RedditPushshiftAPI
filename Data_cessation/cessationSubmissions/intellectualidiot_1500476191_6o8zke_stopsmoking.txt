Help stopping a full relapse

Hey dudes, I quit 111 days ago according to my App. Yesterday I was a bit depressed (for no real reason really, just a random bout of depression nothing serious) and ending up smoking two cigarettes. Obviously I don't want to start properly again after all that work, but my god, I enjoyed it so much. Basically does anyone have any tips to prevent a full relapse?

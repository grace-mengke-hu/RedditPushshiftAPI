Looking for a little help.

I'm about 3 months out since I quit smoking, and while I was smoking I had your basic smoking ailments, coughing and such, but since I quit, my coughing has gotten much worse, which I expected. But it almost feels as if my ribs are sore, which I worry might have to do with my coughing, and there was been VERY tiny specs of blood in my mucus, but I'm not sure if it's from my messed up nose or lungs. I'm getting it checked out this week, but I was wondering if anyone else dealt with these symptoms.

40 days smoke free, still irritable.

Ive got no cravings,  im tempted every now and then because my husband still smokes but haven't caved. The problem is that im still incredibly agitated and on edge. Im snapping so often, I get extremely overwhelmed so much faster now.  It reminds me of the first few days of quitting. 

Is there any way to help this? Does it pass? Ive started exercising more to help relieve the stress but its difficult to go for a run when ive got 2 small kids and my husband is at work.

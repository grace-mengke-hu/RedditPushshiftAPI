Starting Day 1...

I've quit one too many times only to pick up smoking in a few hours to a few months. Over the last few years, i've been extremely sick, and just have not been able to quit. One more try...i really want to make it...my incentive this time is getting out of this dying body...I've been on this sub for a few years...seen a lot of inspirational stories..but have not been able to hold off long enough. I have a stressful job, am more stressed because of my own poor health and need to start enjoying life again.

What can i do to keep reminding myself of the reasons i quit? 

EDIT: Thanks for helping me through the first day. I've gone into the evening now and being able to talk on here helped me immensely. Every time i've had a craving, i came back on the thread and someone awesome had a nice note for me.

EDIT2: The evening was really tough and am into the night now...have been in bed for a couple of hours and have not been able to go to bed. My body is craving a cigarette but right now all i want is to be able to go to bed for a long long time.

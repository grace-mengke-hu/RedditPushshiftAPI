First week done; way easier than I thought

I was never a chain smoker or anything, but after quitting multiple times I felt like I should just commit to stopping once and for all. I had stopped for a couple months before, but always had the urge to smoke. Recently, I encountered some advice on here that has helped me, "Thoughts that make you nostalgic or crave a smoke can immediately be labeled as BS." It's like brainwashing myself.. Anytime a thought like, "Hmm... sure would be nice to smoke..." enters my head, I just immediately without reasoning tell myself, "What a load of bull. That's BS." and I start thinking about something else.. May seem ineffective to some, but this has really helped me. I know it's only been a week, though.. :P

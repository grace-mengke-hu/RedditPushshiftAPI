I MADE IT A YEAR!!!

My last cigarette was at my Bachelorette party on 3/29/2014. before that I was, on average, smoking about a pack a week. I had been smoking for about 10 years. Ranging from a pack a week at my lightest to a pack a day at my heaviest. 

I grew up in a smoking household so this was an extra achievement for me. 

I'm super pleased. 

I still want a cigarette, but I still say no. :)

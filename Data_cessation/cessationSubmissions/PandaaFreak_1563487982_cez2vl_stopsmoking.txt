Consuming nicotine (accidentally) after almost 1 year of being nicotine and cigarette free

Hello all!

I just wanted to share my experience here so that I might help ease minds while also cautioning to stay vigilant at the same time. So here's what happened. 

&amp;#x200B;

I finished reading Allen Carr's book, "The Easy Way to Quit Smoking" the morning of August 5, 2018. I had smoked cigarettes since my teens and had been using a vape pen with nicotine juice in it for just a day or so before I finished the book. However, in Carr's book, he advises you to not only quit cigarettes, but anything with nicotine in it, forever. So that is what I did. (The quitting itself was ridiculously easy and to this day I swear that reading his book and quitting was one of the best decisions I have ever made.) 

Also important to the story is that I smoke cannabis. 95% of my usage is from my vape pen, but I will occasionally partake in flower too. They actually make amazing vegan blunt wraps with 0% nicotine in them that are delicious and I have used them maybe 3 or 4 times since i quit. 

So flash forward to the end of June 2019. My fiancee, my friends and I are all in SF celebrating pride weekend. Its definitely a huge party scene and I was already a little drunk by 2pm lol. Anyway, some of our friends start passing around a blunt while we are in the middle of the conversation and I take it and hit it maybe three times out of habit before it dawns on me that this isn't my blunt, so its definitely not a nicotine-free blunt. My fiancee noticed me probably just staring at the blunt in my hand really hard before she asks whats wrong, and I tell her. The friends who sparked the blunt ask whats up and i tell them about how I quit cigarettes, including nicotine about a year ago and that i was nervous because I just hit the blunt. This leads to a nice conversation about how great it is that I quit and awesome it is to be cigarette free (the friend who sparked the blunt had also quit cigarettes). We continue the conversation and I pass on the rest of the blunt. 

I was nervous that cigarette cravings and triggers would start happening like crazy immediately afterwards. But they didn't. I remember telling my fiancee "I didn't get 'nicotine high'" -- you guys know what I'm talking about. And honestly after that, I didn't think of it again. Until 16 days after I consumed the nicotine.

I remember it was 16 days after because I got a cigarette craving that day! I didn't even know what it was at first. I had made myself a delicious cup of coffee and set it down on my desk. Before I knew what was happening, I was walking to the spot where I would roll my cigarettes (which isn't even there anymore!). And once I realized what I was doing, It all started to click. I checked the calendar, it had been 16 days (almost 3 weeks) since I had last consumed nicotine and my (once dead) nicotine monster was trying everything it could to win me back. But I am a non-smoker and not even that pathetic attempt could even try to tempt me. I am loving my life nicotine free. :)

I know a lot of ex-smokers still consume nicotine regularly in things like blunts, but I was not willing to risk my "sobriety" (is that the right term?) in the beginning, and to be honest, I'm still not. Getting too comfortable makes you vulnerable to your nicotine monster. And I am never going back. So I will continue buying my vegan blunts and will continue to abstain from nicotine in all forms. However, I have a larger peace of mind knowing one slip up wont end it all.

Never another puff!!!!!!

# Tl;DR: I had been cigarette and nicotine free for almost a year before I hit a blunt absentmindedly. I freaked out thinking that meant I was addicted to nicotine again. Forgot about it completely until I had a trigger/craving 16 days after the nicotine consumption. It passed quickly and painlessly. Have not had another craving since. Still committed to 100% nicotine free lifestyle.

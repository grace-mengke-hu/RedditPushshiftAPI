Hypnotherapy and nlp. Anyone with experience?

If I do a google search on quit smoking in 60 minutes, I get hundreds of practitioners claiming 95% success and many of them seem to have the same marketing spiel. Where I am, they want 800 bucks for this service. This rings so many alarmbells to me, but trying to be open minded. Has anyone had a go?

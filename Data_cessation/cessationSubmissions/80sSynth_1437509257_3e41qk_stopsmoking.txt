Quitting by vaping after 7+ years of smoking

Hi All,

I grew up abroad in as an American expat in a third world country. The country I grew up in was extremely relaxed about selling cigarettes and alcohol to minors. As a result of this I was able to buy a smoke cigarettes from the time I turned 12. By the time my 13th birthday rolled around I was a full-fledged smoker. I'm now 19 and have just gone my first week without smoking since I hit puberty. I bought a e-cig and it's great! Sure, not ideal. But I'm no  longer assailed by the urge to smoke a cigarette every 20 minutes. When I have a craving, I take one puff of the e-cig and it quickly passes. My plan is to be nicotine free by the end of the month. I will be a non-smoker by August. Wish me luck!

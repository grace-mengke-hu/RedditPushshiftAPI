Does it still count as quitting smoking if I'm inhaling nicotine through a vaporizer?

I have not smoked a cigarette in exaxtly  3 weeks tomorrow yet I've been vaping almost every day. I have 12mg of nicotine in my e-juice and people are giving me shit saying I "haven't really quit smoking if I'm still taking in nicotine to my lungs." I'm starting to believe I haven't really quit either until I give up the vaping.  What are your guys' thoughts on this? Have I quit, or have my 3 weeks not counted ?

"You smell like a dirty ashtray."

A little old lady spotted me smoking yesterday and told me the above. Then she hugged me and said the next time we meet, she wants to hear me tell her that I have stopped smoking. If that is not a sign that I should quit, I don't know what is. Setting my quit date for Wednesday, I'm going to do it this time!

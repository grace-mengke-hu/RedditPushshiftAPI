143 days so far

Just wanted to share the insight that I’ve had making it to this point, I am now 100 percent positive I have beaten this, as long as I act like I haven’t. I just wanted to really quickly say the main reason I am successful is because of the days that I slipped up. It happened twice and I didn’t not recent my counter on either. Everytime I messed up I would indulge in a large number of cigarettes but the high was no longer there. I would smoke insane amounts. The next day I would wake up and feel like crap. However instead of saying “you feel like shit because you failed at quitting,” I would say to myself “you feel like shit and this is why I am in the process of quitting.” I found the change of wording really helped me. I hope it helps you too.

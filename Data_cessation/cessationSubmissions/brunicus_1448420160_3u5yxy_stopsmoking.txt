Going nicotine free has reduced my blood pressure.

So I'm over ten days into giving nicotine up in all it's forms, longest I've gone in years. Today I went into the clinic for a skin thing, nothing serious, but they did the usual temp, weight and blood pressure. When she read my blood pressure back to me it was ten points lower than my (nicotine) normal. I forget the exact number but it was like 117/78, my nicotine normal systolic was upper 120's and diastolic was mid to upper 80's. When she read me the current numbers I had to smile to myself, apparently the body runs better without poison in it, who'd of thunk it?

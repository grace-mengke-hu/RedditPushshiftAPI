Check out this new badge!

Today's the day.

I smoked my last cigarette 45 minutes ago. In about 3 hours, I'll be sticking on a nicotine patch. In 24 hours, I'll be meeting with my new personal trainer at my new gym to give me something to replace smoking with.

I had to reset my badge here a while back. Not this time, though.

Set a Quit Date

Well I got off the phone with my therapist an hour ago and after whining about how broke I am, how I eat too much, and how I should quit smoking I decided to stop complaining and do something about it. We decided it would be too hard to tackle all of my vices at once (eating, shopping, and smoking) that we'd start the one with the quickest short term benefits (save money!) and the biggest long term benefits (not be bald with yellow teeth and no lungs).

So, my quit date is Sunday. I should be done with my pack by then... where do I go from here?

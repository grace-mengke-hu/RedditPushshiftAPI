Good workout routine after stopping

Been a smoker for 4 years, before that I was a pretty competitive rower. I got injured horribly and had to quit a sport that I loved and was incredibly intense. Got depressed and started cigarettes. 

I've already set a quit date from a month from now, I'm going back to university for my 3rd year, and plan on going on NRT. But I feel after not working out properly for 4 years and smoking, I don't know what's the best way to start working out again. 

Who has some good workout routines for people who just stopped smoking?

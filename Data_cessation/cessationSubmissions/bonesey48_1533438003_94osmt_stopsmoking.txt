Setting a quit date?

I really wish I wanted to quit smoking, but I don't think I want to. Every time I set a date the day doesn't feel 'significant' enough. It feels like it should be a groundbreaking life changing thing but it's just an ordinary day and I usually cave within a day or two. Can anyone else relate to this feeling? I feel like I know that progress comes in small steps and not big leaps, but if I don't make a big enough leap I still feel like the same person, and that person wants to smoke.

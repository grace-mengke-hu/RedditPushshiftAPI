It just seems to keep coming back

So I guess I'm here for support. I hate smoking, I have tried so many times to quit and I cave too easily. I know its something that I have to do myself and no-one can help me do that but when I'm struggling and alone thats the first thing I do is walk out and buy a packet of cigarettes. It might be my last Â£10 for the month and I'll spend it on cigs instead of food even just so I  can handle not having my mind run around and around not knowing what to do. 

Ive found the only thing that can seem to make me just stop is having one of my friends just say NO to me, it seems so simple but just that validation and care from someone else I guess is what I need but being rather alone with my situation now has made things difficult and I need to find some better ways of coping. 

Ive tried vape, Ive tried patches, Ive tried a lot of things but just cant seem to stop it from eventually coming back. I go through these stages of even feeling sick when I smoke because I hate it so much but it doesnt seem to make a difference, it still just ends up going around and around until I just do it. 

If anyone can relate and maybe have some success in any sort of similar situations you might have got through I'd love to hear. Just really want to do this and I cant do it by myself. 

Thanks

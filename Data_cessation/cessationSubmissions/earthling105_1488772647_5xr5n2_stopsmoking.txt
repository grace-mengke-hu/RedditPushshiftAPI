I quit and i know I'll never smoke again

I don't really need any encouragement or support. I've somehow managed to turn off a switch in my head and I know I'm done with cigarettes.

Not bragging, but wanted to say it publicly :)

To everyone who's reading this thinking "will I ever be able to quit" here's my advice -

Nicotine is the root cause of all evil here. Understand how it works, what withdrawal is and how to cut it out, and you're golden.

Almost four days. No nicotine left

Hi folks. I haven't smoked since Tuesday night so it's been almost four days. The nicotine should all be out of my system apparently. But the mental habit is the hardest one to break, in my experience.

I'm going out tonight and I know that once I've had a drink, I'll crave like crazy. My plan is that when I feel the craving hit, I'm going to return here and write something to take my mind off it. I hope it'll work. Drunk hatfink can be irrational as hell, you know? I just really don't want the guilt that comes with caving in to cravings.

Tried to quit many times before... This time, I'm using an app, and it seems to be helping. 24 hours after my last smoke, I craved hard, and normally that would have been it, I'd have smoked straight away. This time I loaded up the app and played with it for a while and it really reinforced my plan to quit. Anyway, it's helping me a lot, so thought I'd share that. There are lots of quit apps available but I'm using Smoke Free.

Good luck to you all, maybe catch you later!

Day 17 - Feeling great today!

Today I woke up at 6:00, and went for a 4km run. I've been building up over the last 3 weeks and pretty proud of myself for sticking with it. 

Weekend was pretty laid back: got the smoker out and made some BBQ chickens and had a few beers with family. It's nice to feel that the last few weeks have also helped me to reduce my drinking. It is a big trigger for me so I am just keeping busy at family events and leaving when I feel it is becoming too much.

This week I believe will be the best so far and I wish you all the best of luck in the day ahead.

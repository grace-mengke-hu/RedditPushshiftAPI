The first craving that you don't have.

Took off the nicotine patch on day 2 (I still support those who use it), and although I'm only on day 4, I feel I'm making progress. 

This is what put me in a great mood to start out the day: Got in my car, drove to work, no craving. 

I'm sure I'll have cravings throughout the day, but the fact that I did not feel the need to smoke during one of my triggers (driving to work) was an incredible feeling.

I am a non-smoker!

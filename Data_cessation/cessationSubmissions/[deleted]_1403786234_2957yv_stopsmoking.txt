Day 5 - Don't know if I'll make it

Woke up on my 5th day, and the cravings just hit like a truck. I'm starting to second guess whether I'm ready or not, and if I really want to quit. They don't really go away after a few minutes either...

After all that I've read about quitting, I still genuinely believe I enjoy it, but I also don't want to sacrifice my money and health on it. But at this rate, my mind just keeps pumping out excuses... push the quit date, maybe just casually smoke, etc. 

I just wish there was some kind of effective alternative. I've tried e-cigs and although it helped, it clearly didn't feel the same, at least for me.

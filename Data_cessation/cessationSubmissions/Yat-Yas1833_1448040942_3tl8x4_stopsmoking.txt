I'm such a bitch....

This is literally my first reddit post ever, and I'm using it to whine.  I'm on day 6 without any kind of smoke, dip, vape, gum, patch, etc... complete cold turkey. I want to explode.  I can't focus, I can't think, I can't do my work properly.  I do not want to quit smoking, I love smoking, but I have children and I want to be in their lives as long as possible.  I smoked for right around 15 years, with a hundred thousand failed attempts to quit in the process.  The only thing that is keep me quit now is that I bet someone $1000 I couldn't go six months tobacco free.  So I made the pain of a cigarette worse than the pain of not having one.  I'm not going to cave right now, because I will not fail.  I just want to stop feeling like I'm losing my mind. I do not feel like day 6 is any easier than day 1, 2, or 3.  I know its irrational, but it feels like I'm always going to be fighting this hard not to smoke, and if that's the case why bother.... I hate myself for being this weak and controlled by a leaf wrapped in some thin paper.... Thanks for letting me bitch guys.

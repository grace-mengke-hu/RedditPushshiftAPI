Day 1 - Trying to quit for her

Hey all, made an account so I could reach out for some support on this and maybe some other things later, I'll try to be brief!

I've seen that some of you have experience quitting for others/loved ones.. I had my last cigarette an hour ago and I threw the rest of the pack away! I also downloaded the QuitNow app.

Been smoking about a pack a week for 7 years or so. I notice I get cravings every 2-5 hours, basically depending on if I'm at work or not. But when I go out and drink once or twice a week, cravings are probably closer to 15 or 20 minutes.

A friend of mine is coming to visit in a month, she's probably the most beautiful girl I've ever met and she means a lot to me. She lives very far away and we keep things platonic, with a little flirting here and there.

Frankly, I want to impress her. I'd feel a lot more confident if I established better habits and lost a few pounds, but exercising as a smoker is, as you all know, not so great. Diet is no problem for me. I've got a gym membership that I haven't used in a while. In general, I usually take things on by myself. I'm pretty strong willed, but as many times as I've tried to quit smoking, I have to admit I need some help.

TL;DR I want to impress a beautiful girl when she visits me next month with the confidence from quitting and getting in better shape. Thanks for the support :)

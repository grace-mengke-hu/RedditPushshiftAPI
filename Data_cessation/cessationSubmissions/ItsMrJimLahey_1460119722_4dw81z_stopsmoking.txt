Something I have to confess to the sub...

I just smoked a cig 2 min ago after 166 hours. I just snapped, used my stressful ass job for a excuse...I am not happy with myself and it didn't make me feel any better.  However I am still going to try and quit. Just because you smoke one cig when your are trying to quit doesn't mean you should go and grab a pack again. I have to reset my clocks but I am still quiting. Keep it up guys!! We are all in this together

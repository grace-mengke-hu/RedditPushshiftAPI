WTF? I thought I was doing great...

I thought I had a handle on the cravings...had ways to distract myself and refocus my mind.  I was so proud!  Not sure what happened this morning:  I am crippled by the desire to smoke A cigarette.  I know that's a joke.  Ummm, I don't know where I am right now.  

This is my first original post so let me include a bit of background.  And it will keep me from thinking about smoking! HA!  I am 47 years old and have been a professional, full time smoker for more than 30 years.  I have only ever tried to quit once: a year and a half ago and I lasted 11 days.  

UPDATE: I haven't smoked but I feel like shit!  Both physically and mentally I feel horrible and am having trouble finding success, victory, or any sense of accomplishment.  The not sleeping is really dragging me down.  Thank you so much for all your advise and kind words of encouragement.  For now, I am pressing forward.

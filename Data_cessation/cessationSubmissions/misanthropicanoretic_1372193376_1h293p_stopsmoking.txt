I want to quit, but smoking is such a big part of every day it seems.

I've been smoking for four years on and off. I currently smoke a pack a day without thinking about it. I use to smoke two packs a day. Everyone I know smokes, because of the drug recovery program we're in a guess. There's something about drug addicts and smoking. I like to get to our meetings early... but it's so hard to not smoke around everyone. There are multiple cigarette breaks at meals too. It's very hard for me to drink coffee and talk with someone for hours without a cigarette. Scratch that, it's not hard. It's impossible for me at this point in time.




I told myself if I could kick crack and heroin, I could kick nicotine. But it just is not so. I want to get in shape and enjoy exercising. Also, I have asthma. Also, the cost is killer. I enjoy it less than I use to.





I'm making a decision to cut down as a transition to quitting (permanently and forever). I want to be mindful of each cigarette, and if I don't want to finish it, I'm not going to.





Just wanted to get this out there. I really don't have the money or lung capacity to be killing myself like this. Lung cancer isn't sexy. I have a good singing voice and I'm going to lose it. Smoking also gives me acne. Sometimes my breathing is so shitty that I cannot even sleep. And yet still, I continue. Because "everyone around me is doing it!"





Ugh.

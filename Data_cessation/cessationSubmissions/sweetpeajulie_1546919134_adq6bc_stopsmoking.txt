What has worked for you to quit?

I've read lots of Allen Carr and have the motivation!  I was able to quit for two days, cold turkey, but really struggled with lack of concentration and extreme depression/darkness.  

I actually had very little desire to smoke, but wanted relief from the zombie brain I was experiencing, and the very depressing feeling that I can only describe as "darkness".  Has anyone else experienced this?  

What methods have you tried?  What worked/didn't work for you?

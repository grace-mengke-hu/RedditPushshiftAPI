4 months no cigarette about to break tho

Sorry for barraging r/stopsmoking with negative shit but I'm four months in and about to buy a pack. Me and my just had a fight, we just got to Italy today, he threw something at me and is saying I'm a bully, I just really want a cigarette right now. If I just smoke this week can I stop? Why did I even stop in the first place? I can't remember. Please help I'm really feeling like it would be fine to buy a pack.

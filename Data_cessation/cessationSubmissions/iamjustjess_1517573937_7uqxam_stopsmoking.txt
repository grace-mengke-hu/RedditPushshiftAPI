How to cope with unbearable location based cravings?

I gave up smoking the day I moved cities, six months ago. 
Today I'm back in the city I used to live and in and around the places I used to live and work. I'm only here for a day.
I am experiencing the most intense cravings I've ever had and I don't know how to resist going to the shop and buying a pack! 
I am rationalising having a cigarette by telling myself it'd be fine because it's only one day and I won't take any back home with me when I leave tonight but at the same time, I don't want these 6 months to have gone to waste! 
Any advice would be much appreciated

Day 6ish

I’m feeling pretty good. Maybe like twice a day, usually when I go outside for some fresh air, I think “man, fuck, a cigarette would be good right now.” But I know I’m in it for the long haul and the compulsions become less persuasive every day. Looking forward to the day where cigarettes don’t even cross my mind! What a regretful habit that I’ve picked up, I guess I’m lucky I only did it 3 months before the addiction spiraled out of control. My brother has used chew for 7 years, and my dad has used nicotine gum (the stuff that helps you quit) for 20 straight years now. 

Trident gum was a big help on my day 1. I just chewed it till my jaw was tired piece after piece. I was thinking a jawbreaker may also be beneficial but didn’t try it, just an idea if you want to. Then on day 2 I just munched on potato chips quite a bit. Good luck.

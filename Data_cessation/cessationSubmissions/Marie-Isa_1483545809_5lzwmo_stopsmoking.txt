Day 8

I'm so proud to be here today, beginning the second week of my new life.  My health had improved so much in one week, I can't believe it.  I can run!
I still have big cravings, but I manage them (when it becomes unbearable, I just take a nap until it's gone)
It's a big help reading all the messages here

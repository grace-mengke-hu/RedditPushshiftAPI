10 years of smoker and 3th day on my Champix

*I've tried tons of methods and engaged cold-turkey many times for years and champix was my last resort. I've had enough with every failed tries and it was breaking down my will to quit smoking*

I'm still smoking but getting bored/disgusted/etc with every single death stick. I notice that I'm only smoking the half or even lesser. I was finishing up more then a pack a day (probably around 25) now it's 15 or less. I don't know if it's the placebo effect but actually I don't care :) if that placebo helps me to stop it, I'm ok with it.

I loved smoking when drinking coffee and it was impossible for me to drink a drip of coffee without lighting a cig. Today I've tested myself and bought a huge cup of coffee and now I can finish a whole cup without firing a cig :) Which is a pretty good achievement for me.

But I had a **really** hard time when waking up today and I had (actually still have) a HUGE light-headedness now. I had really hard time to keep my thoughts together or focus on anything also didn't had much energy to walk or talk..  I'm going straight to the bed after writing this. I hope this light-headedness is not caused by champix. I feel really uneasy. (it's like being tipsy but not like tipsy) My stomach started to get uncomfortable too. Aaaanyway, see you quitters tomorrow!

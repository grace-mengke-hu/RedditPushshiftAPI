Just starting...

I just quit smoking, and I'm more hopeful than ever before that it's the last time I quit.  I have been smoke free for 118 hours.  I was in my first 24 hours when I had a small bump in the road… actually it was a cement pillar, and it was in a parking garage.  But I resisted!  I've had a cold for the past three days, but I haven't given up yet.  I want it.  And I want my 5-year old to be proud of me… no more "making smoke" or playing with "fire-sticks" for me!

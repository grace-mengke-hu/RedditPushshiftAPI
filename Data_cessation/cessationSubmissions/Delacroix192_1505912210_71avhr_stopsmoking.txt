Two years vs two months

Been two years since I finally decided to stop buying cigarettes. And other than the occasional one I’ve had while drinking I haven’t had any. My smoking went from 1 pack/day to having only smoked like 1 pack over the course of the past year. Would you consider this 2 years ago my quit date or should I tell people from the day I touched my last one, which was a couple months ago.

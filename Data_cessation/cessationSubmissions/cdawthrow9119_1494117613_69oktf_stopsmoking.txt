How to avoid smoking at work?

Hi everyone!

Quick Q. 

How the hell do you all manage to avoid smoking during work? 

About me: This is easily my most difficult hurdle to overcoming cigarette dependence. I understand being disciplined for long enough will make the habits / cravings slowly dissipate but does anyone have any tips for how to maybe...reroute my habit of leaving my office every 1.5-2hrs to smoke? I work ITSec so my face is glued to a screen for practically 8 hours a day and as ashamed as I am to say it, I am spending every other hour anticipating my next cigarette. The weird thing is, I've come to realize, I don't care about the cigarette at all but it's the ritual that I've set up that keeps me coming back. Leaving the office + 1-2 cigarette(s) = 1hr earned of enthusiasm towards work. 

Vaping doesn't work to well for me and if it matters any, I have nearly no desire for nicotine, and I don't do drugs (including alcohol). Cigarettes have always been about escaping and shutting my mind off. To this day (4 years, 19-23), I am not a fan of the taste or smell. My cigarette is just my friend. My dirty, smelly friend who has my back when I need to get away from life. If anyone has any tips to share, I'd love to read them.

Thanks for your time!

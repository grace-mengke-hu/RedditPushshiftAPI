First month in 5 years with no cigarettes!

I quit for the New Year and finally made it through January. I haven't gone an entire month without a single cigarette since I was 15.  I *couldn't* imagine myself *not* being a smoker when I was that young so I convinced myself that there wasn't a reason to quit now.

I started smoking some cheap ass cigarettes in brazil (like $2 US a pack) and to me they were practically free. Once I moved back to the US I was 18 and started blowing WAY too much money on cigarettes. I'm looking forward to making 2017 my first year cigarette free since before I ever smoked my first cigarette.

Good luck to you reading this and anybody you may know struggling to quit. Wish me luck on my journey, and smoke weed everyday whenever you're craving a cig ;)

Hung over and feel like crap...

I keep repeating the same cycle over and over... drink some wine.. cave in ... and buy smokes.. feel like crap... heart beating out of my chest.. anxiety, that awful feeling from smoking the previous night... I don't want to be on this ride anymore! What the heck is wrong with me? I don't think I'm an alcoholic... I haven't smoked weed since I began trying to quit smoking... but giving up drinking some wine every few days seems to be my complete downfall. What do I do now... do I need to completely stop drinking for a year or two? Any help appreciated very much. Thanks.

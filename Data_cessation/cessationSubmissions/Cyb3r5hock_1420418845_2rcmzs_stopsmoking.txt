Small tip if relapsing!

So I'm currently about to close my third day without smoking and I came so close to relapsing last night. So far I have refused to buy any more tobacco, but last night the pressure got to me and I noticed I still had some loose tobacco on my desk where I roll and do work.

Now when I say some, I'm talking miniscule. I roll my own and I barely had enough to match half the length of a filter, but I was desperate and any hit is a hit, but that's when it came to me me. How pathetic I must have looked, scraping away at my desk to find the next hit, no matter how small it may be. I'm 19 years old and I'm too good for this shit. I'm not an academic by any means, but I am far too smart to throw my life and dignity away to a fucking plant, let alone one that does nothing for me.

So what I'm saying is this. Next time you're about to relapse, when you're about to cave and you're throwing all of your progress away, just take a step back and look at yourself as if you were a stranger, as if someone could see you while you're at your lowest. I'm addicted and my body knows it, but fuck my body and fuck my addiction. You won't get anywhere by cowering away and waiting for the addiction to go, you need to look it in the face and tell it that it can go fuck itself for all you care, and that you won't be conquered by a chemically laced plant. Quitting for me has been a fight every time I've had a craving, and fighting takes aggression and determination, but it's a fight I'm not going to lose. Well that's how I see it anyway.

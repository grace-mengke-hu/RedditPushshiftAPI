Patches? Gum? Cold-turkey? How did you quit?

Right now I have a 21mg patch on. I have one left for tomorrow. I don't really want to do the step down process, because it will cost too much money. Should I just make tomorrow my last day with out nicotine after this patch is gone? Maybe keep some nicotine gum on hand in case i get a serious craving?

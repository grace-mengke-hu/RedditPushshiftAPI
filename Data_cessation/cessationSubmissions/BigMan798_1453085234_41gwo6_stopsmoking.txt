I'm proud to say it's been 4.5 months now. I feel awesome, but need advice about eating habits that are out of control!

This may be completely normal, but I'm starting to get worried. Sorry if I'm making a post that's been made before.

I eat very healthy food (with the occasional indulgence) but I have been completely binge eating since I quit smoking.  I almost feel like I'm just as addicted now to food (which was never a problem for me in the past) as I once was smoking.  The amount of food I consume in a day is mind blowing.  People actually comment on it regularly and it's embarrassing but I never feel full!  It's like since I don't have my post-meal cigarette, the meal can't be over? Does that make any sense? I tried chewing gum but I will seriously kill a pack of gum in 20 minutes. I'm sitting in bed right now with a full stomach but can barely focus on typing this because I want to go eat more.

I feel kind of annoying for posting this but could really use some advice.  I just want to live a craving-free life. I feel awesome for putting cigarettes behind me, but still feel anxious all the time because I constantly crave food.

Thanks in advance everyone!!!

6 days in

Hi, Iâ€™ve been smoking for 30 years &amp; my first ever quit day was 29th October. So Iâ€™m into day six cold turkey and things are going better than I thought apart from lack of sleep! Does anybody else have this problem, Iâ€™ve never been a great sleeper but since quitting itâ€™s been awful, Iâ€™m lucky if I get 4 hours a night &amp; thatâ€™s disturbed ðŸ˜©

Does anyone find the return of their sense of smell as trying as I do?

All of a sudden I can smell my soap, and my shampoo, and the way my beard smells after I take a shower, and every ingredient in the food I cook, and everything the guy next to me on the bus has been drinking that day &c&c. It's a little overwhelming to me.

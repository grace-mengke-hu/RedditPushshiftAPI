I feel shitty about it. I honestly am so healthy during the week but when I get around a social situation on the weekends, it's like I can't avoid it. It also doesn't help to have people literally waving them in your face trying to get you to smoke after you've even told them you don't want to. My buddy kept telling me I wasn't being myself or not doing what I want. 

I also have an ongoing thing with my girlfriend (long distance) who always asks me if I smoked on the weekend. To which I ALWAYS tell the truth because she's quit and I feel like that's the right thing to do as far as the honesty thing.

I don't know. I need to stick to my guns. Just posting this for myself mostly.

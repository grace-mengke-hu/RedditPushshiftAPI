Getting back on the horse after a couple of days of trips!

Went the whole day today without smoking and I feel great again, it so wasn't worth the few days I tripped and started to spark up again. For everyone else reading this who can relate, my mistake was when I got a craving, instead of facing it head on I half gave into it, as in I got an electronic cigarette which only gave me a stronger urge to smoke. Don't make the same mistake I did! We can all get through this! :)

A big day for me =)

Well I finally made it to my second full month nicotine free...no cheating, no drags, no gum no patch no vapor. I still remember when making it past 3 days was a significant challenge. 

I'd really just like to thank everyone here who encouraged me, and especially those of you who provided me with the link to Alan Carr's easy method on youtube (seriously check this out if you're struggling).

To those of you a bit farther back on the road, I have some advice:

1. You are not "trying" to quit, so stop saying that. You quit, period.
2. Don't worry too much about whether you've gone 5 days or 6 days. Concentrate on today. Today you will not smoke. That is what's important.
3. Cravings are just withdrawal playing tricks on you. Smoking will not remove the craving for more than a few hours. Quitting removes the cravings for good.
4. Every time you say no to a craving, it gets a little easier and it feels a littler better. Soon you'll wonder why you ever said yes.

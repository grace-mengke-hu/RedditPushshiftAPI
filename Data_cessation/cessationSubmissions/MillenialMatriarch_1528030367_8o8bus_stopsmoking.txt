The smoking spouse

Sunday mornings were my favorite. The only one of the week when no-one has to rush to any place, and my husband and I could spend hours sitting on the porch, enjoying hot coffee and cigarettes. 

I'm trying today to sit with him as usual, but it's too tempting to smell the smoke this morning. Shame because the weather is so pleasant. I don't know how to get him to talk to me or spend time with me outside of sitting on the porch with a cigarette in his one hand and a phone in the other.

Since quitting I've spent a lot more time with my kids and taking the dog to new places for extra long walks. I've stayed mostly upbeat and have been much more active than usual, but I miss my husband. Im a little concerned that we are just going to grow apart in this (note: I do not at all see this as a justification to smoke). He has only considered quitting once ever, insists that there is no good reason to quit, and becomes instantly angry at the suggestion. I hold on to hope that I'll set some grand example and he'll just try out of curiosity someday. 

I don't know. Just venting here. 

12 days down, and I'm not smoking today.

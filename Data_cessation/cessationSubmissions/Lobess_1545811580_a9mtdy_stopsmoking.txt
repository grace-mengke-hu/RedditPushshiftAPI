2 years smoke free today

Seems so long ago, but my last cigarette was two years ago today.  I can’t believe that I was that addicted smoker, feeding that nasty habit and taking away from my quality of life.  30 plus years.  It was hard, but one day turned to one week to a month to year to two.  You will never look back and regret a day you didn’t smoke.  You might be uncomfortable, anxious, irritated and depressed for awhile but you won’t regret not smoking.  You will be persevering a better life.  And two years later you won’t relate to being a smoker.  It is wierd to think I was an addict to nicotine for so long.  It tricks your brain and screws up your serotonin and dopamine receptors.  I am so grateful to be free and in the non smoker population.  I did it!

I need some help with distraction!

Hi guys. So I have quit probably 12 times in the last 3 months. Each time I make it through the weekend (with help from another Redditor's advice on taking a weekend to get through that 72 hours) but the minute Monday comes and I start working, I am back to smoking. 

I know it's my own fault, but hear me out. So I just moved 1,700 miles away from my family and I barely have any friends down here. I live with my boyfriend and he works from 6am-7pm m-f. Then there is me. I work from home and have my own home office. It's just me and my cat. I relied on those 10 minute breaks every few hours while I work. Because hell, I hate my job. Every time I stop smoking, I feel so confident. I don't even HAVE withdrawls because I know it's "all in my head". But then Monday comes, and I'm back to smoking a half a pack a day.

What are some things that I can do, for 10 minutes at a time a few times a day, to replace smoking? I tried standing outside and just taking in fresh air, that was just torture. I've tried doing dishes and I just want a cigarette more after I'm done... I've tried petting my cat, but well, that's just not the same. 

It's like, when I have a cigarette, I have a time constraint. I'm only doing it for a limited amount of time, and then I'm done. I can't continue that ONE cigarette after I'm done with it. 

Has anyone had a similar problem? What did you do? What can I do? 

P.S I tried reading Allen Carrs book and it drove me insane.

Thank you so much for reading, even if you can't offer any suggestions :)

Anyone else on the Patch?

I've been on the patch where Friday will end 4 weeks of non-smoking...

I had read online that the patch approach should be 4 weeks step 1, 2 weeks step 2 and 2 weeks on step 3.

Although the box says 6 weeks on step 1...

Anyone felt 6 weeks worked out better than 4? or vice-versa?

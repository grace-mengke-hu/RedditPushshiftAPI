New method?

I have been smoking for around 18 years, and lately was crushing 2 packs a day.

I have tried many methods to stop with complete failure. BUT the only thing that's working for me is scheduling the cigarette intake.

I have my own office where I can smoke freely. I did a simple math of calculating the rate that I light up a cigarette:

40 cigarettes per day (16 hours) = 1 cigarette every 0.4 hours (24 minutes).

I didn't track my daily commutes or any activities. I made an average calculation passed on quantity and overall time to calculate the rate. 

Note: This is a rough calculation but you'll see why I'm using it.

I started to gradually increase the time between cigarettes. I actually used the timer in my phone to remind me to smoke every 30 minutes. My consumption was lowered to ~ 32 cigarettes a day (with ups and downs) during the first 2 weeks.

Then I increased the period to be 45 minutes between cigarettes. I would literally light one up once the alarm went off even if I didn't have the urge to smoke. I don't know why it's working but I feel that I'm reprogramming my brain to rearrange the smoking pattern. Jumping from 2 packs a day (40 cigarettes) to around 12 cigarettes a day within a month.

But there is something strange happening to me and I really need help to understand it. I don't know how to explain it but I'll do my best.

I become "addicted?" To the notification sound more than the cigarettes. Sometimes I would be doing my work, not thinking about the cigarette at all but then the notification comes in and I'll get those "jitters"...

The closet thing I can compare it with is the pet click training, where the sound of the clicker becomes satisfactory as much as the treat itself to the pet. I hope I'm making any sense...

Planning to increase the timing between smokes to 60 minutes. Please let me know if you're interested in updates or if you have any ideas that might help.

Thanks for reading.

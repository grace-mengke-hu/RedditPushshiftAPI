Mindset is everything.

At 9 days it's now officially the longest I've gone without nicotine since my first cigarette nine years ago (which made me vomit - why on earth did I smoke the second one?). This has also been by far the easiest quit attempt out of dozens, even without elaborate cutdown schemes and nic replacement and all the rest.

The difference is my attitude. Unlike previous attempts I went into this with an attitude not of deprivation, but of **liberation**. Instead of mopingly, begrudgingly going into this thinking "well I guess I've got to go through this... sigh..." I threw the remains of my last pack into the fire and just said with complete sincerity "well thank God that's over." And while maintaining this mindset for the past nine days, the cravings have been incredibly easy to deal with compared to previous attempts.

Of course I've had the cravings and had times where I've thought to myself, "gosh I'd like a cigarette," but it's pretty easy to reframe that self-talk into "this is when I would have smoked." In reality I don't want to smoke, like at all. For one, there is no such thing as one more cigarette. One turns into two turns into ten thousand. It's taken me dozens of mishaps within the first few days of an attempt to learn this lesson. Second, it detracts from my goals. I'm setting my smoking money aside to pay for a trip to see the eclipse in Chile in 2020. I'll be damned if "one more" comes between me and that. Third, I was diagnosed with HIV a few months ago and now have a life or death need to do ALL THE THINGS it takes to live a healthy lifestyle. 

Now, I'm not about to rest on my laurels at just 9 days and lose my vigilance. It's just been nice to have finally found something that makes this bearable and possible for me, and it was as simple as finally, REALLY understanding that there are no upsides to smoking and that to quit is to liberate yourself.

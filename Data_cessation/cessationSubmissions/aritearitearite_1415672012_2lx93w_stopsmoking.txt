Fidgety 3 months after quitting smoking cold turkey

Hey everyone,

I quit smoking cold turkey 3 months ago.  I had been a smoker for 7 years.  Aside from other withdrawal symptoms i faced the past few months like allergies, depression, mood swings, etc.  I've noticed that im fidgety now.  I just can't seem to sit still sometimes.  I need to stretch, cross my legs, etc.  Has anyone experienced this? Is there an explanation?

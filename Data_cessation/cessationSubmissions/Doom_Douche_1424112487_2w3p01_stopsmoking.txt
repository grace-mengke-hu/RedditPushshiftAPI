I'm planning on saving the money I save through an app called Acorns.

I figured out I spent almost 300$ a month on cigarettes.  I found an investment portfolio manager app that is stupid simple to use.  Lets you for example round up debit card transactions, schedule contributions or just do an instant transfer from your bank.

I have one of those iquit apps running letting me know how much money I am saving by not smoking and a couple times a month I am just going to transfer money into this app under a "moderate" portfolio and hopefully watch a secondary nestegg grow.

I am sure there are others out there but this is the one I used.

Not as ready as I thought

I went from no cigarettes a day, to "Just one at night to help me get to sleep" to "Okay also one in the morning with my coffee" to "And another when I'm downtown" and then "It's been a rough afternoon with the kids"....

This is hard.

I guess I'm not quite ready, and I have a lot of heavy stuff in the next few weeks. 

Removing my badge for now. I will try again in a month. Stay strong!

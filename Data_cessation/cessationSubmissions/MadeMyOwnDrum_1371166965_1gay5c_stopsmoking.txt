Using Meditation along with Hypnosis to Quit Smoking

I am working with a meditation instructor/clinical psychologist to develop an intense, customized session of combined meditation and hypnosis to help me quit smoking, and I'm hoping that some of you here will help me brainstorm ideas to optimize the session. Here's some background:

I'm 32 and been a smoker since age 13. I've quit at least a dozen times, and the best attempts made it 2-3 months. I haven't made it a week without a cigarette in about a decade.

I am very experienced with a mantra-based meditation style (over a decade), but had problems with it. I am currently practicing breath-based and some awareness-based meditations (just a few months into my new practice).

I want to come up with a few (maybe just one?) simple, powerful, positive thoughts to deeply ingrain into my consciousness that will be effective in helping me quit.

Any ideas? Has anyone else tried anything similar?

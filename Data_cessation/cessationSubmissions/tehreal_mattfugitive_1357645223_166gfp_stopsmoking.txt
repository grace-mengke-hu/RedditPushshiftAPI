Just hit the 30 day mark!!!

Here's my current [QuitNow! Stats](http://i.imgur.com/KduBm.png).

It's been a hard, crazy, long road but I hanged in there.  I will admit I had help with Chantix but it was short lived.  That medicine made me bat shit crazy. Not suicidal but just plain frigging weird. So within two weeks of starting Chantix I dropped it and kept going.

I won't lie I failed once, broke down and bought a pack but the taste and the smell made me sick to my stomach so that pack ended up flying out the window of my car onto the 405 just outside of Kirkland, WA (sorry for littering).

I've been enjoying this though and whenever I feel the need to smoke, I stop what I'm doing... take a breather... focus and look at how long I've been going and how awesome I feel.  I plan on using the money I saved on cigs for a gym membership within the next few months.  I'm just waiting for the gyms to quiet down a bit.

Anyways to all of you trying... hang in there!  The pay off is seriously worth it.  I'm still fighting but it gets easier with each passing day.

Also I wanted to thank /r/stopsmoking for being there.  I don't post much but I do try to read every post and I learn from all of you and can relate with all of you as well so thank you.

Day 7 - morning ritual

Part of what drove me to quit was how shitty I felt as a result of being slave to cigarettes. I felt it had control over me, or rather, I was not in control of myself.  To prove to myself that I was in fact in control and that I did have the tools to manage my life, I started with the most dramatic change I could - throwing out the smokes.  

In any case, in the spare time I've had since my quit I've read quite a bit about things successful people do.

One common denominator is consistent morning rituals.

So I took a few elements that I have done for a while and put them together into a list so that I can rely on it when my brain is fighting me...I've always benefited from having a list to check off. 

- no phone use in bed
- make my bed as soon as I get out of it
- 10 morning glories (toe touches and then up to the sky) and 20 push-ups
- coffee
- walk dog
- write 3 hand written letters to family, friends, or business associates

I don't believe it's realistic to do all of these each day, but I'm going to try.  I did it today. And I'm going to do it tomorrow.  I'll worry about the next day when it gets here.

And I'm not going to smoke.

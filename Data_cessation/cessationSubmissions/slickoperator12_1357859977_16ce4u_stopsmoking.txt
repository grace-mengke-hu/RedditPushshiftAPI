I made a short video diary about my quitting cigarettes. It is a project you can add to! (x-post from r/jumpercut)

I quit smoking on January 1st, and recorded a short video every day for a week afterwards. I used this cool iOS app called jumpercut that I've been working on, and would love to see some of you're quitting stories!

Here is the project link (click it on your i-device after downloading jumpercut from the iTunes Store) if you want to contribute!

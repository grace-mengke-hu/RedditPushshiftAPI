I didn’t mean to quit smoking

But I did!  I may have over-imbibed a bit on NYE And when I drink I smoke even more.  That resulted in me feeling less than awesome on NYD.  It was cold and crappy that day and I didn’t feel like going outside and feeling worse than I already did woth a hangover.  So I didn’t smoke.  Then I didn’t be next day.  And so on.   So today is day 5 smoke free!!!!   I have smoked for 24 years.  I like with my boyfriend who is a heavy smoker, and I’ve still resisted.  My best friend is a heavy smoker and I’ve still resisted.  I think this may stick!  Here’s to day five!!!!!

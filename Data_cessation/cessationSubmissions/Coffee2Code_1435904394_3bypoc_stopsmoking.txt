I (nearly) kill people when I try to quit.

Yeah fun title innit? 

I'm a 21 year old guy, with PDD-NOS, and trouble with making anger go somewhere else than expressing it. 

I've tried to quit smoking four or five times now, but when I do I get so irritable that people around me literally beg me to start smoking again. 

My SO who lives with me smokes too and is not planning on quitting. 

I need advice :(

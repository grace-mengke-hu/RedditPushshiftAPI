Today Is the Day

So I've started and stopped smoking about 100 times in the last 5 years. I have 3 cigarets left in my pack and after that im done. Its going to really hard and im sure ill want to kill someone. But I need to do this for the following reasons

-10$ A PACK
- I have young children
- 35 years old and i feel like shit
- last but not least i dont want to depend on nicotine anymore.

well im motivated lets hope i can finish the task.

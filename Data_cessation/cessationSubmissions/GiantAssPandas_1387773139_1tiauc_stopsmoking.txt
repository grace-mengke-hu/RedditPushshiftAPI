One Week! Feeling goooooooood

I have now made it a whole 7 days without smoking a cigarette or having any type of nicotine, and truthfully I feel great. I have had the occasional cravings but I have noticed if I can just find a way to get my mind on something else they will go away. Just wanted to make a post about it! 7 Days! Yes!

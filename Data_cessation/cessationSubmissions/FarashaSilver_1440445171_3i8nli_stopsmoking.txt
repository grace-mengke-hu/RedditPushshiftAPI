Just started my journey on Saturday, and I'm apparently hell on earth to live with

I didn't tell anyone but my husband that I was quitting smoking - cold turkey, as of Saturday. But pretty much everyone I've come in contact with since has asked me if there's anything wrong. I am short-tempered and just generally irritated by anyone talking to me at all. This is a bad thing when my job is in customer service.

Anyone else who has gone through this, how do you keep the mood swings at bay? I am not using any NRT (no vapes, patches, or gum) as the last time I tried to quit I ended up more dependent on NRT than I ever was on cigarettes.

2 weeks. Thank you Reddit for making my life better ten fold.

As can be seen on my badge. I have just made it two weeks. I'm loving the feeling I'm getting from this. THANK YOU SO FUCKING MUCH, THIS SUB LITERALLY SAVED MY LIFE.
That being said, I have a question. Ever Since I quit, I've become extremely emotional. This is beginning to freak me out. Will this pass?

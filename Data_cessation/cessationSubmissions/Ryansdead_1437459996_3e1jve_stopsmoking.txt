I really need this...

Hey guys. I really want to be proactive about finding help with quitting smoking this time. I've been smoking a pack a day since I was 16 years old. I have Asthma. I spend all my money on cigarettes and every cigarette I have I am disgusted with myself. I have ADHD and am prescribed vyvanse which makes cravings really tough. I'll be checking back into this sub everyday in an effort to stay motivated.

Once again I faltered..

I gave up smoking (nth time) and I remained smoke free for over a month..had a small hiccup once..over came it but them I gave into the trap and have been on the bad path for over 3 weeks now. Plan to start all over again tomorrow...Will reset badge again and start new. I preached how one cig can lead to full blown addiction and I fell into the same trap thinking I had it under control..There is no one CIG..I hate it but at the same time there is some part of your brain that comes up with ridiculous excuses... NOT ANYMORE.. :-( HOPEFULLY.

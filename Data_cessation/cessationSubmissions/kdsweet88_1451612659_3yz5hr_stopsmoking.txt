I am fighting a relapse so hard right now.

I literally decided to quit 2 days before my actual quit date.  I never really had any side effects, other than emotionally.  I am currently on day 40, and while being immensely proud of myself, I have missed smoking every minute of every hour of every day since I quit.  I'm depressed, angry, irritable....just nasty overall.  I don't want to do anything.  I'm so wanting to go to the store and buy a pack.  I've read it helps to psych yourself into hating them before you quit, and I didn't.  I was heartbroken to finish my last cigarette.  I feel like an idiot.  I'm completely nicotine free, and on New Year's Eve when people are resolving to stop smoking, all I can think of is STARTING again.  I just don't think I broke the emotional bond.  And I don't feel like I can without actually smoking, and experiencing the reasons I should hate it [i.e. the taste, the smell, my breathing, etc].

I should probably also mention I didn't quit because I hated it.  I LOVED it.  I quit because I know it's better for my health.  I'm thinking that's my problem?

I just don't know what to do!

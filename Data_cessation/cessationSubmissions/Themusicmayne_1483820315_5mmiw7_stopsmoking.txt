I'm currently readying myself to quit. Need advice!

I always said I'd never smoke forever and now I have a girlfriend who despises it, I figured it'd be a good time to quit.

I just wanted to know what you guys consider to be the best way. 

I've been looking at Allan Carr's book, which I think I may read, but I'm not sure what steps I really need to take to really quit!

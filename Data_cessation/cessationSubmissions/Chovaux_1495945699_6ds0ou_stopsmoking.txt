In Vegas for the weekend, struggle is real

I was going to set my quit date after this trip, however I could take how cigarettes were making me feel 3 weeks ago. I've never felt better before in the last 8 years I've smoked. Tomorrow is my 3 week mark, and I'm going out with my best friends to a great concert tonight. I keep delaying myself, breathing, and taking my time looking at where I'm at right now. I guess why I'm posting this is because I'm hoping for some encouragement when these temptations should come up. Stupid I know, however just want to have some connection with someone who might be struggling/tempted like me. Hope to hear from you all! This is seriously such a great community and cannot thank you all enough for helping me along the way. FYI, please forgive me in advance for any stupid drunken messages haha!

Relapsing is becoming a habit, but it's stopping from today.

Over the last year I've been giving up smoking and have successfully done 2 months at regular intervals without cigarettes. Then I would relapse again. Usually a relapse would follow directly after I'd shared with someone that I'd given up. In April I was relapsing every 2 weeks as opposed to 2 months, so the habit was sneaking in again. 
I don't want my health or finances to suffer any more than they have done, so I'm in it again. I'm going to call myself a non smoker and refuse to let temptation get the better of me. There are no excuses. Smoking makes me poor, ugly and smelly!!!!!! Why would I want that?!!!!! :-)

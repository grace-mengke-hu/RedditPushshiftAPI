Well would you look at that. I really did it.

The big 365! In the last year I've progressed from only being able to run 1 mile without stopping to running 10 miles without stopping (and I used to HATE running, even before I started smoking).

Fuck you tobacco. The first 4 months of quitting were an absolutely miserable experience. Everything after has been pretty smooth sailing, with only a touch of nostalgia here and there. If you're just starting out just keep it mind that it WILL get easier, but it takes a lot longer for some people. I remember talking to people who only had cravings for a few weeks after they quit and I was sitting at 4 months still having daily cravings. BUT they went away eventually, and now it's waaaaay easier to stay quit.

If anyone has fun ideas for how I could celebrate the 1 year mark let me know!

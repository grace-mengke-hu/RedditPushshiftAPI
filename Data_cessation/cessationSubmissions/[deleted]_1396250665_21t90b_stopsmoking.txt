I just had to put this out there. Been a chain smoker from 6 years. I quit. This is the first time I'm trying to quit. I'm not putting that cigarette in my mouth anymore. It's been 14 hours and I intend to keep on going forever.

I'm going to start working out and save a lot of money. I hope this lasts.

A caution regarding vaping.

Vaping is a great tool to keep from using tobacco, but it's really just the same thing in a slightly healthier package. 

For anyone using vaping as a tool to quit smoking, be careful with it because it's too easy to get used to using it all the time at whatever nic strength you're using. I quit smoking (pack a day) using a vape about 5 years ago, and over that time period I've increased my nicotine consumption by double from where I started when I was smoking. Now I'm working on quitting the vape and I have a bigger cliff to climb down to get off of nicotine. 

But at least it's not cigarettes, right?  It's a big step and it's much easier to switch from smoking to vaping than quitting nicotine altogether, but it's still really unhealthy. It's definitely better than smoking, but that's not exactly where the bar should be set for something to be considered healthy. 

Just be careful you're not making things harder for yourself when you want to quit nic altogether, that's all I'm saying.

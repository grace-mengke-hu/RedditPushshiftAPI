Had a relapse. What now?

I still do not want to smoke. I've bumped down to step 2 of the patch 2 weeks ago but here's a series of events 

My dad died
My dog was diagnosed with breast cancer 
My internet connection on my phone keeps dropping
My laptop needs a system restore 
Everyone's chewing is driving me insane

So I had half of a cigarette. My crying has stopped. My puffer wasn't even helping. Is the trick to just not do that again and find other ways to cope? It sounds like such a simple solution.. But my depression from the past 2 weeks makes me lack the motivation. You guys helped me through my first hump. Now I'm asking for help again

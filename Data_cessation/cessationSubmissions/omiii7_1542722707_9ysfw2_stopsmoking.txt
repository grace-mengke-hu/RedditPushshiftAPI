Just wanna ask you guys this

Almost 5 days in I just wanna ask you guys something. I'm 26 and I had been smoking for 9 years. I never smoked 2 3 packs a day my maximum would be 11 12 cigarettes and on average I smoked 5 to 6 cigarettes per day. 9 years and I never crossed this number, I don't get it. And after quitting I only feel mental or psychological effects nothing physical. Before this I hadn't gone more than 1 day without a cigarette for 9 years. Have any of you been this kind of strangely addicted?

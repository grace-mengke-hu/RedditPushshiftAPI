I quit for three weeks, and it was easy. Now I'm back again--worse than before.

I've quit smoking more times then I care to count, but the last time it was easier than anything. It was like, I just walked away from them. My cravings were minimum and only lasted a few minutes at the most. I didn't even think about cigarettes for the most part.

My girlfriend and I broke up, then I slipped up. Again. And again. And again. Now, I'm worse than before and quitting has been harder than ever. I'm having trouble even hitting the 24 hour mark.

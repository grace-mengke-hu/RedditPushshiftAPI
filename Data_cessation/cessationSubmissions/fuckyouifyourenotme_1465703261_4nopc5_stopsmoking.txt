65 Days

And I didn't think I would make it this far. I started with the aid of wellbutrin, after smoking for over 20 years. I started having weird nerve issues in my extremities about a month in. Doctor told me to ditch the wellbutrin and so I did. I have managed to stay quit in the face of many circumstances. I have even attended an event where I allow myself to experience all manner of things I don't do in my normal life and have not smoked. I feel really good about this, guys! I feel like I'm actually done! And my SO still smokes. I smell and taste it on his beard. It smells lovely, but I have no desire to smoke :) Truly, if I can do it, so can you! :)

70 days free and on the edge of starting up again

I am really in need of some support.

I'm currently under the most pressure of my life, and I feel like caving in.

From smoking 15 or so a day, I've been smoke-free for 70 days. I haven't even been within 1 foot of a cigarette.

But this last week has been the most stressful and pressured of my life. 

I'm a university student. All my deadlines are this month. When I smoked, I was an absolute machine. Feel tired? Smoke, work. Need a break? Smoke, work. Hungry? Smoke, work.
Now, however, I find myself wondering around, sometimes bored, unable to get on with what needs to be done. I would sooner watch an episode of House of Cards than work on my many projects. 

And I am slowly convincing myself, I've shown I can quit. I should start up again and crank out some serious work! I won't make it otherwise!
This is what's going on in my head. Ffs.

Secondly, my mother is helping me fund this degree. It's been a month or two since we last spoke, and I'm trying to get in touch with her again, I'm almost broke and I'm constantly worrying she is going to cut me off for some reason. And if that happens, there is nothing I can do (I'm studying in a foreign country, with no financial aid available). 

All of this is pushing me toward the edge. I see people in the lab I do my projects in smoking regularly. My supervisor today said: "Brb, I'm just gonna pop out for a smoke." I'm being really tested here.

Man, I don't know what to do. There's tobacco shop over the road open for another 2 hours. I shouldn't. I must not.

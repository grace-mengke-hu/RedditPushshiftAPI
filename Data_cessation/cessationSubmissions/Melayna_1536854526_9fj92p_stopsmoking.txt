Didn't need to change my flair today

After  at least 10 false starts in the last year, this is the first time I can say that I logged in to this group and didn't need to reset my flair. I'm still at 27 days. Some days are harder than others, but it's now down to passing moments, not full minutes where I debate stopping by the convenience store.

At the end of today I will have four full non-smoking weeks. Thanks to everyone here for sharing their stories, their false starts, their grand successes, and everything in between.

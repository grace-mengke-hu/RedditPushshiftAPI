Today was the worst day since I quit.

I quit close to a week ago, I was returning home from a get together with friends, waiting at a train station to get home. every single person on my perron was smoking simultaneously save for one baby and a little girl. To make things worse, I ran out of nicotine mints that morning and I happened to find half a pack of cigarettes in my bag that I apparently forgot a long while ago. I even put one in my mouth but at the end ended up breaking it in two and throwing it on the ground. The case whas similar to how I started smoking, I think that's what made it so bad: just standing there waiting with nothing to do and a cigarette just in your pocket. I'm really glad I didn't give in today as this is my first serious and longest event to date and I plan on keeping it that way. Stay strong, because it's worth it in the end.

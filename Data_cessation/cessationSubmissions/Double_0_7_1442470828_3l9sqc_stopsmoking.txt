Could not have done it without you all!

One month ago, I would have thought it impossible. After 35 years of at least a pack a day, not one more smoke for a month. 

Thanks to all the posters here. Your stories have helped me more than you'll ever know.

Special thanks to the poster who's niece badgered him to stop smoking one month ago. Your post gave me the boost I needed to finally call it quits. I hope you are still not smoking. 

It hasn't been easy, but my desire to not smoke still outweighs the desire to smoke.  Good luck to all.

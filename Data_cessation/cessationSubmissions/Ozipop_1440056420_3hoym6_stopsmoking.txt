10 Down. And I'm moving up!

About a year ago I went through the application process to be a volunteer firefighter in my small town. At the end of it, I was denied because they have a requirement of no tobacco use for 3 months prior. It's one of my biggest motivators to quit this evil demon. I'm looking forward to a physical for the first time in my life. Life is too beautiful and short to throw it away on a self propagating disease and addiction. Good Luck to you all! Far less amazing people than you have quit this menace. Chin up.

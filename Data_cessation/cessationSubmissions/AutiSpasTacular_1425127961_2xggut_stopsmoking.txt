I think I'm getting better

So yesterday, after my gf broke up with me due to all the health complications with energy and my simply not being there, I decided I was going to cut back because quite honestly I'm tired of being tired all the time and having no energy. I think I smoked about seven cigs, which is way less than the day before. (I chainsmoked 3 when she broke up with me) Most of the day I had a LOT more energy, but getting to sleep was a challenge because I skipped that last cig and popped a valerian instead. I slept like crud and woke up several times during the night, but this morning I woke up, waited maybe 30 min, had a smoke and I actually GOT A BUZZ.

I didn't even have cravings or anything, nothing like the day before. I'm dead from lack of sleep, but I'm gonna do this. I can do this. I just wanted to share because I haven't gotten a buzz from a cig in like... months... This means my brain has gotten to the point where it doesn't really need that level of nicotine or whatever. I'm pretty happy. I can't believe that just happened.

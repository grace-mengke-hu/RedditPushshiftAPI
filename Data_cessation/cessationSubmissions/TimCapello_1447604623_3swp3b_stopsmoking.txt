You are giving up nothing but smoking itself

Last night I was at a party at an apartment building and a group of people went up on the roof to smoke cigs.  It was a group of about 8 people.  All of the non-smokers at the party stayed behind and didn't even think twice about it.  

One of my favorite parts about being a smoker, though, was the social aspect of it.  Going outside for a square led me to some amazing conversations and memories.  Smoking with a group of people on the rooftop of a 10-story building that overlooks the city would have been one of those great memories that I associated with smoke breaks.  

But when I quit, I told myself that I was giving up nothing but smoking itself.

I joined the smokers, we had great conversation, and the view was beautiful.  Instead of puffing a cigarette, though, I took long, deep breaths.  The cool November air refreshed my lungs.  Looking to the street below and respecting how high up we were was a natural buzz.  And my fingers didn't reek when I went back inside.

You are giving up nothing but smoking itself.

That post-meal cig doesn't make the food better. That cig when you're stressed doesn't make your problems any easier to deal with.  That cig at the party doesn't make the night more fun.  You don't need cigarettes as an excuse to go outside and breathe.  

Oh hey, I'm 1207 days smoke-free.  Word.  I lost count a long time ago.

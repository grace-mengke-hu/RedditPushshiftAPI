I decided to quit today.

I’ve been reading other people’s stories on here and decided to join the sub. I decided today that I want to be healthy. I’m still young enough to lower the risk of disease. I may not be able to completely remove all risks, but I can decrease them. Even if I relapse, I’m going to stay here and push through until I quit for good. I downloaded a quit smoking app and am going to reduce my alcohol intake which will help a lot. I appreciate everyone for being here. Let’s support each other and take our health back.

I don't feel like myself without my addiction

My addiction to tobacco was how I differentiated myself from my Mormon upbringing of being the youngest of 3 boys. It was the first time I felt like I had an identity separate from the pressures I felt by my brothers' "successes". Their friends used to tell me "I was the normal one" because I didn't have a solid 4.0 GPA and I lied to my parents about partying (and partied for that matter) like a "normal" teenager. I raised myself walking with one foot in the: "my parents don't give a fuck about me 'cause they already got 2 successful kids" train of thought and the other in the: "I'm actually a really talented, intelligent person with a lot to offer to the world" line of thinking. Recently I started actually giving a fuck about my education and it triggered a desire to quit smoking so that I could keep learning. Smoking tobacco was like the perfect aid for my depression because it let me wallow in my suicidal self pity without committing actual (immediate) suicide. It ironically made me enjoy living my life, knowing that it was killing me. Now I feel as though I'm falling back into my old "fuckall" attitude and I miss that confidence and self-identity that I found with tobacco use. I try to tell myself that it was ME not the tobacco, but it's a struggle.


I'd also like to apologize for my previous post here... I painted a picture of myself that was exaggerated to the point of trying to bolster some sort of achievement I never really even had in mind when I first started smoking. Sometimes I'm a coward...

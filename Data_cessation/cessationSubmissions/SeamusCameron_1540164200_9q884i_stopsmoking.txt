Need Advice on Heart Palpitations While Quitting

Holy crap those are scary. Day 2 of smoking as little as I possibly could. Went from smoking half a pack a day (probably a bit more, I smoked about a half pack a day at work and after, and then at home I'd use chewing tobacco). Realized there was one thing my body could do that kept me from going cold turkey.

Cranked up my heart rate until I felt it pounding in my head. Could noticeably feel my pulse pounding in my neck and chest as well. Overall incredibly worrying. First day I got the shakes and dealt with it, but having my heart freak out scared the crap out of me.
Ended up smoking 3 cigarettes over the course of the evening so I could sleep and I've had one today after the palpitations. It's been a decade of dependence for me now at 27.

Talking with my doc on Wednesday about possibly doing NRT so my body doesn't freak out like it has been. Right now just looking forward to getting through the next two days on as little nicotine as possible.

Anyone else have experience with this/advice they can give for dealing with it? 
I've tried breathing exercises but it was like trying to put out a California wild fire with a squirt gun.

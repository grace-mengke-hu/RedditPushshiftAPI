I didn't think I'd actually accomplish this at all.

But, tbh, I didn't really have an option. I was spending too much money on cigarettes and I didn't even like smoking anymore.. it was just something I *did*.

So some things I noticed after hitting a year:

* I don't crave cigs unless I'm **extremely** sad/stressed/whatever but it's more of a passing "gah I wish I had a cigarette" followed by a "Oh wait, I'm not a smoker and smoking wouldn't change anything" thought. 

* I don't dream about smoking.

* If I see a cutie on the street with a cigarette I find myself thinking, "Oh they're so attractive.. too bad they smoke though."

* I don't think the smell is nice anymore. It's pretty gross, actually.

* I can sit through movies, presentations, or just sit for an hour without needing to get up to smoke/feeling cranky without smoking. It's nice. My patience has gone up!

* I'm bothered when people don't smoke in designated areas. Ya makin'  my air smell bad!

* I know immediately if someone just smoked or are a heavy smoker. I'm incredibly embarrassed by how stinky I used to be.

* I'm no longer getting really bad chest congestion around this time of the year due to smoking in the cold.

* I save a lot of money by not buying cartons every month.

* I don't remember what my favorite cigarette tasted or felt like. I don't really care to find out either. It'd be weird to ask for them at the gas station.

* I don't consider smoking an option anymore. Seriously.

The first 6 months were unpleasant, but after that it's been smooth sailing. I only smoked for 4 years so ymmv, but I'm really proud of myself.

Just gotta overcome my candy addiction now. D;

Anyway, I don't really come here anymore unless it pops up on my front page and someone is asking for advice. I'm at a place where I don't need support for my addiction because.. I don't feel like it's really controlling me anymore. I also know that I can't smoke ever again so I'll always be addicted. I accept that. Smoking is gross anyway.

Thanks for being there for me when I needed it. I appreciate this sub so much!

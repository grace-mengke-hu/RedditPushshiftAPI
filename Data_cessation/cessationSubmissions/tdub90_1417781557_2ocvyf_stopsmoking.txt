Quit number 2...

I quit a about a year and 6 months ago. I read EASYWAY, and used a bad cold as a springboard. I by 6 months clean believed I was a confirmed non smoker but due to stupid decisions in recent times to just have one lead me down a slope of feeling the cravings and impeding my life. So I am back at it, read EASYWAY again, and feeling really good about being able to stop again. There is nothing more annoying than feeling that constant pecking in your head, watching the health degrade and feeling of self worth crumble with every puff.

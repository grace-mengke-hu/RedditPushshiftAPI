33 years smoking 2-3 packs a day...

today makes 10 months smoke free. I have no want or desire to smoke. I enjoyed smoking and never had smoking related issues. If I can quit, you can too. Be strong and do what you have to. Use this sub for all it's worth whether it's to brag, blow off steam, or to offer encouragement to others.

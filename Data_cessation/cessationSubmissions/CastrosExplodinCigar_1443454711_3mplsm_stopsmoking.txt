WTF...

I thought I'd check in after being away for so long and I wanted to see when I'd hit the 1000 days mark.

It's tomorrow. I never thought I would get this far.

My advice for everyone, stick at it. For me, the first three months were hard then afterwards it becomes tolerable, it's a case of remembering you are a non smoker. I'd still get the odd craving but it's more like a reminder that I used to smoke rather than a "I need a cigarette" moment.

Keep at it folks. I was a 20 a day man for 15 years. I used to smoke between courses in restaurants, breakfast was coffee and cigarettes, lunch was a smoke break. I thought I loved it until I realized I was kidding myself.

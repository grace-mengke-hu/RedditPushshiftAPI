2 Weeks. No Smokes.

Been busy at work and summer classes in college, no time to smoke anymore. I can't believe I've been smoke free for 14 days, it's surreal. I finished up my antibiotics yesterday and now the phlegm coughs are only coming once a day! 

Cravings come and go now. I've been listening to a lot of [Tycho](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6ih1aKeETk) lately, keeps my brain quiet. 

I really recommend Tycho, the music is so relaxing and it beats smoking after a long day of work & school. 

Can anyone explain what down-regulation is, and how this relates to triggers? It's a bit complicated to me, lol.

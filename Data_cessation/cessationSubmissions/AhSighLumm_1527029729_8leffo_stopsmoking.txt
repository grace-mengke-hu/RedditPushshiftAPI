Sigh. I caved. Kind of. Need some love from you all!

Long story short.. used to smoke, got into vaping which turned an addiction, quit entirely briefly. 

Recently I have been overly stressed and keep asking for cigarettes which leads to me having between 1 and 3 cigarettes a day. Today I decided to go and get some vape juice again and I'm going to try and will myself to ONLY vape when I feel like I want a cigarette (at work etc). I'm using 0mg nicotine as I know I have done it and can do it again. 


I feel like such a failure though and I keep blaming different stressful situations for it. It's really bummed me out considering how well I was doing before. Including making other good lifestyle choices, gym etc. I guess I just want some support that I can come back to every time I get those cravings. 


Thanks &lt;3

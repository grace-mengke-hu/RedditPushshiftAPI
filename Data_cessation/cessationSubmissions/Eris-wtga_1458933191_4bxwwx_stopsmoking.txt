Quit vs quitting

So at day 24 managed a stressful day at work & then a night out of drinking with smokers, no thoughts of wanting a cigarette (few pangs, but easily taken care of with nrt). I didn't go out to vape  when the smokers went out, like I did last time I was out drinking & generally using it less with a lower dose. 

So I'm doing well & part of me is really starting to feel like a non-smoker, but part of me is scared that if I let my guard down I'm going to slip & get sucked back in. So my question is: when is it 'safe' to say\think that I've quit? (Not sure if I'm explaining the difference between the 2 that is in my head)

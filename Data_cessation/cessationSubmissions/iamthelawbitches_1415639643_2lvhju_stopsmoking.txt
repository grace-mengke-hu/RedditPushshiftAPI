76 days.

I smoked a pack a day. 76 days ago, I received the news that my dad (who smoked 2 packs a day), had colon cancer (evil tumor). That was enough for me to start hating cigarretes, as the evil gang that was trying to kill my dad. I bought the first box of nicotine patches.
Fortunately, my dad's recovering very postively and is on his 3rd chemo with excelent results. The craving is still there, waiting... But since I finished the patch treatment I've been doing great. I was able to go to a wedding, be surrounded by smokers, have a couple of drinks (common detonator for the urge) and I survived.

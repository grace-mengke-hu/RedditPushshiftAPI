3 days in, a lot harder than I thought, any advice or support is appreciated

Here is my story: 
I have smoked for â‰ˆ14 years, I have quit before but never fully and only ever for a few months. I would always sneak cigarettes behind my SO's back and never really wanted to quit.

I decided earlier this month that I would start quitting (tapering down, maybe even using the patch, etc.) the day after my birthday, which would have been August 19th. Some insane family issues popped up and my stress levels were in the stratosphere. So quitting was pushed to the back-burner.

A couple days later, on Sunday the 23rd, my broken rotted teeth (partially from smoking and partially from being born with really crooked, weak, fucked up teeth) started pulsating with the most intense, excruciating pain. Nothing I could do would stop the pain, the only option was to get all 4 teeth removed.

As an aside, my shitty teeth have been part of what has kept me smoking for so long, I have a lot of emotional pain from how bad they are (my parents kind of neglected me growing up), pain and frustration from that made me smoke more which made my teeth become more fucked up.

Anyways, after inhaling nitrous oxide and listening to the grinding removal of those fucked up teeth, I realized that all of my woeful, self-centered, morose thinking was going to ruin more than just my teeth and my general health.

So, since I can't smoke anyways, lest I run the risk of dry socket; I am quitting cold turkey. 

My lungs fucking hurt so bad, and I feel like I have a mild cold. I am trying to fight the sour mood I am in as best as possible.

I really wish I could eat a Steak or a Bacon, Egg and Cheeseburger. Which after eating mashed potatoes , soup, pudding and other geriatric foods, I think I will reward my 10th day of not smoking with some meaty treat that would make Ron Swanson proud.

Any advice or just general conversation would be great.

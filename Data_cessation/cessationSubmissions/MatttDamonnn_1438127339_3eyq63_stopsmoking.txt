Threw away my last pack at 5:00pm. It is now 7:30 and I already want another cigarette.

Anyone want to give me some pointers so I can stay successful?  I'm 28m and I have smoked probably since I was about 13.  Some days I can go through 2-3 packs, some days barely 1.  The point is that I need to quit.  I have tried in the past and it should be noted that I have really bad anxiety disorder, which is often flared up when I try to quit smoking, so how can I avoid all of this and stay strong?

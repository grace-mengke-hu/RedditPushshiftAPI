Stopped smoking since December 1, 2015

Ignore my badge. I'll get a new one. So I have over three weeks smoke free and here's how I did it. 

I was a weed smoker, then started smoking cigs, the vaped, then back to cigs (pack a day).

December 1, 2015, I started using nicotine lozenges. (4mg). per suggestion from a friend. I would go through a lozenge bottle every 2 or 3 days. I did this for three weeks. Now I am lozenge and smoke free at about 24/25 days now. I also stopped drinking and stopped smoking pot. 

I feel good most of the time now@! Cheers!

First day without the ecig so far (accidentally even!)

So I get to work this morning and it hit me - "Huh. I did not take one drag off my ecig this morning (I'm using it as NRT for right now) - I realized that I didn't even think about it the whole drive.  Maybe I'm starting to phase that out too, without even having to try very hard!  Yay!!!

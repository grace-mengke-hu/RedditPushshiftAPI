having some success.

quit a million times. Finally having some success with using gum and e-cig combo. The gum levels me out and the e-cig i can use if i feel close to buying a pack. Seems to be working so far. 2.5 days in. plan is to tapper down the gum to 2mg after a week, then quit either the gum or the e-cig week after that. then let go of everything the following week. 

EDIT: on to day four! its been a long time since i have made it this far. feelsgoodman.jpg

EDIT:
Today is day seven. My one week milestone. I have today elimated the e-cig from The mix. To be honest I could have dropped the e-cig sooner I think, but I set a plan on the outset and wanted to stick to it. So now just gum. I have the remains of a box or gum that I'm working my way through. Thinking about getting one more of 2mg to sort of carry me through the final tappering off. I'm feeling really good about my progress and finally feel like I have put that nasty habit behind me. What a relief.
One think I have noticed is that the reflex to smoke is deminished greatly in just a week. I still have twinges here and there but catch myself and think, "hey you are a non smoker, you don't smoke so do something else that a non smoker does".

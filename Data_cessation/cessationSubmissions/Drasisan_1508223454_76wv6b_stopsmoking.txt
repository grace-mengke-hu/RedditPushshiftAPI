My stop Smoking Diary

Hello everyone, 

Well, I've been somking too much (almost 12 years already) never passed the pack a day though, always around 6 to 15, unless there is a lot of party or stress during a day but is very rare.

So I wanna try something here.

I like writing, I like talking, although people usually don't like hearing or sometimes everybody is just busy or there is nobody to talk to.

So... I'm gonna come here and write everytime i feel the urge, everytime a day passes, everytime a want to smoke a cig.

I hope is not considered as spam, because it means there might be 3 to 10 posts a day making this go up and up... And if this post starts to disapear it might mean i've relapsed or i've forgotten, i do hope is the second one. If I do relapse I will write it here.

So... to not do it alone... I would encourage anyone to come in and write down if that's what makes you feel more relaxed. 

It does help me to understand my own urge... right now i'm picking up a pack of chips to not smoke, i removed the cigaretes from my office table and the ash tray i left it somewhere else... anyway smokers will be around me and the smell of smoke will exist (I live in Asia, lots and lots of people smoke and you are allowed to smoke literally anywhere). 

Good luck to myself and to all others who are stopping and fighting this addiction.

Tell me not to

At the emergency vet again, for a different pet, and definitely not for heart disease. I think today makes two weeks cig free hahaha. Looks like some kind of infection. Wee cockatoo, whom I love like a child, threw up twice\-\-very bad sign. Just the visit is extremely expensive, let alone any diagnostics they need but he's my child and I will go to the moon for him.

I also am fairly certain that if anything serious is wrong with him, I will smoke. Tell me not to. Thanks. I'm just waiting now, can't even see the wee guy right now.

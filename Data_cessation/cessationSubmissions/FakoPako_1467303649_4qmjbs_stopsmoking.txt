6 months! I can't believe it!

WOW, it's been six months since I smoked. I still can't believe that I did it and I finally pulled it off! This feels so awesome.  I hope all of you new year quitters are hanging in there. I really have no desire to smoke at all. Cravings are gone. I could not imaging me smoking ever again and inhaling all this crap into my lungs.

I am actually thinking about completely quitting drinking as well. I don't drink during the weekdays, but when I hang out with my friends on weekends, I tend to drink drink drink.. like a fish. I have no stopping point. I think this will be my next thing to conquer and I am looking forward to the challenge. 

It's funny how I feel that I can do anything now, after quitting smoking.

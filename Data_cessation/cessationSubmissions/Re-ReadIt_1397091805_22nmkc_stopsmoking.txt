It was you that got me this far!

I started smoking when I was 14; I am in my mid-twenties now. I tried quitting before and always returned to smoking. Generally I would  claim the "I'm still young!" clause as my excuse for not quitting (I've tried and failed may times before). I did not want to stop smoking, but I did want to be a non-smoker (if that makes any sense???) so when I went to visit a friend in NYC a few months ago I brought no nicotine products with me (nicotine is crazy expensive there!) with the intention of quitting. It was hard, really fucking hard. I told my best friend, multiple times, that all I wanted to do was punch her in the face. Why? Because she encouraged me to quit and I wanted to give up.
I had so many moments my first week when I honestly thought that my life had no value, that without cigarettes I was living for nothing. I didn't understand how I could be walking along and suddenly think that if I didn't have a cigarette to look forward to, then there was absolutely nothing left for me in life. But I stuck with it and sought support. Although I would not consider myself "in the clear", I do feel so much stronger! I can do this! I am not stopping, I am overcoming! I just feel like a bigger person and I have been able to stop/reduce other problem areas in my life since quitting smoking.
Thank you all so much! Your stories and advice have kept me strong and will continue to help me through this. I wish the best of luck to everyone in quitting and I hope that I can continue to beat the cravings and look to you all for support!

It's my birthday!! And 7 months today I quit smoking BUT

I have been thinking about smoking more today then I have in a long time? Why?!?! Maybe the extra glass of wine tonight or that your alone on your birthday, the ex bf that you have a hard time getting over.... even though he is a fuck face (yes I am angry) that does not deserve my heart or tears or that alot of people you hold dear to your heart has yet to day Happy birthday or that I have gained 12 lbs since quiting smoking. These cravings today suck! BUT I will remain non-smoker!!

Just dropping in to say hi!

January 28th will be my 3 year anniversary. You guys can do this. When I was in your shoes back in 2015, I dreamed of hitting just 1 year. Now it's been 3! I really didn't like hearing stories of people who were 2 years smoke free and caved, because it instilled doubt and fear in me. But I am here today to tell you guys that I have remained strong. Honestly, there is not one OUNCE of me that ever craves a cigarette. It's as if I never smoked a day in my life. You guys can do this. ANYONE can do this. 

Make decisions based on your COMMITMENTS, not your emotions.

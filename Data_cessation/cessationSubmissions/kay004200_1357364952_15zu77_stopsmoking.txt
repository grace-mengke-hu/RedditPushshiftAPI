Smoking dreams!

I've been having dreams about smoking since night 2 or 3.  In the dream I will smoke and then feel awful guilt in my dreams. I'd wake up feeling so guilty and sad that I had caved in, then realize it was just a dream, then I am instantly relieved. In the dream the craving is so strong that I am just a wreck, climbing the walls for a cigarette.  Then I wake up and get on with my day and remember that there are no cravings, there is no nervousness at all, just pure happiness and certainty of my decision.  I will never smoke again so why the crazy dreams? It's like the little monster has resorted to psychological warfare, but I fight back with pure oxygen in my lungs, over and over. 

 I found the book on audio on amazon for $13 so I sent one each to two of my friends.  I hope they will listen to it.  I'm actually having a lot of fun with my quit.  Good luck, fellow quitters!

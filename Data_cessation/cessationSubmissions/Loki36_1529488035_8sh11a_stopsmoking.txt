Trying to quit cold turkey from now.

I have been trying to quit cold turkey for a year now and I always succumb to the junkie thinking and give in. I do want to quit smoking and hopefully succeed this time. 

I am making this post to keep myself accountable and motivated. I am going to deal with this one hour, one craving, one day at a time.

I will post regular updates to motivate myself and tell myself quitting is worth it and the physical effects of stopping smoking are just transitory. I won't succumb to the junkie thinking. So here it goes.

2 hours smoke free. Feel like smoking, but I won't. I don't smoke.

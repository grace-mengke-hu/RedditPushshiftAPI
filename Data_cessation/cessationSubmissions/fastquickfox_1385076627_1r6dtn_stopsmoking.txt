Finally I can compete without a self-induced disadvantage.

Have quit smoking for about 10 days now and already feel the results on my physique. I am an avid rugby player and play at a pretty high level, have always had a good physique but obviously needed more time to recuperate from sprints due to my packet-a-day smoking habit. 

But now, no more! I can already feel the results, need a lot less time to recatch my breath and already making a difference on the playing field. This was obviously not my main reason to quit as it was never problematic for my sport. But it certainly is an incredible bonus, I feel like I can take on a lot more...

This forum is a great outlet and each time I have a craving I end up here reading what my fellow newly non-smokers wrote.

So it's been a little over a week and I am doing great then bam.....Found a huge trigger.

So I read EASYWAY quit right after with no regrets and haven't had any bad pangs.  Like the book suggests I have actually enjoyed a lot of the withdrawals as I realized its my body and mind getting better.  But I found a huge trigger last evening and that was having sex.  Eating and driving and things like that haven't been too bad but for some reason last night and into today my mind has tried to play some tricks.  It sucks that literally one of the best things in the world with one of my favorite people has put me in this state. I wasn't miserable on the outside but when we were cuddling after, all's I could think about was smoking and tbh it really sucks, at that point its the last thing I want to be thinking of. So has anyone had similar issues with this? Any help?

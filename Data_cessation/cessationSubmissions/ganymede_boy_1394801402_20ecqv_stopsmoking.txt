Day 772... Pi day.... Friday... Cake day...

Just wanted to say THANK YOU to all you wonderful /r/stopsmoking bastards and bastardettes for the continued support over the years (how can this be my 3rd cake day already!?). More importantly, thank you on behalf of those who recently quit and come here for encouragement, support and assistance in their journey toward nicotine freedom.

Keep up the great work fellow former smokers!

God I bought a pack today!

I have been trying to quit and went on a month streak without one of those cancer sticks. But my partner and I have been having a really hard time getting along and went to therapy today and they told me that they couldn’t think of one thing they liked about me (ouch) when the counselor asked. That stung pretty bad and I started crying. They finally felt bad enough at the end of the session when they were asked again by the counselor what they liked “how welcoming I was”. Thanks I guess?! Honestly I couldn’t handle it and broke down and bought a pack on my way home. I am all frantic and anxious and just want another cigarette after the one I had from getting home. I am on the verge of tears and don’t know what to do. I just need help :(

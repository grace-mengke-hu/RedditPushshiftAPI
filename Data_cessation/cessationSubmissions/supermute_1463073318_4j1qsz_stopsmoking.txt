Made it two days, second day was the most discouraging thing I've ever experienced

I will say that this was the first time I've gone even one full day without a cigarette in the ten years since I started. The first day I was off work and I didn't feel too bad, I only had one fairly bad craving that was over pretty quickly.

The second day was horrible though. I was at work and I felt awful from the moment I got there. I always read that a craving only lasts a few minutes, but there was a good four hour stretch where I felt like I was about to lose my mind. It wasn't even that I wanted a cigarette, it was that I just wanted to feel normal again. I had all kinds of negative thoughts running through my mind for some reason, things I haven't thought about in years. By the time this stretch was over I was feeling like there was no way I could possibly do this, I can't go an extended period of time feeling this way. I started feeling better towards the end and made it home, but I broke down and went to buy a pack shortly after.

I'm going to stop again tonight on a work night and I'm hoping to make it for good this time. If I end up smoking again, I'm just going to quit again. And again. And again and again until it finally sticks.

While I'm here, does anyone have any good ideas for snacks and stuff to use when I'm craving a smoke? I got some hard candy and planned on just popping one in every now and again, but I ended up eating them like crazy. I went through about a bag and a half of them and was starting to feel sick by the end of the night from eating so much candy.

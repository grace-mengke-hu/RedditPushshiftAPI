Nov 30th 2015

I am 27 years old.  Been smoking since I was 19. Have tried to quit  a countless amount of times,  but to no avail.  Everytime I convienced myself that I could quit anytime,  unfortunately everytime it got harder and harder.  I've lied to my girlfriend in the past about saying I had quit,  and ended up smoking behind her back.  Of course her being a non smoker,  she smelt it on me,  or saw through my lies everytime.  I broke down in front of her when she found a pack of mine.  I thought for certain I would never ever be able to quit again, but I woke up one day in a miraculous turn of events and told myself this is the day.  This is the day I quit.  No longer will something that brings nothing but nothing into my life control my everyday lifestyle.  That day was nov 30th,  2015. I will forever be an ex smoker from there on out.

Today is 5 years for me.

I had my last cigarette at 4:30 PM on March 26th 2012 while driving down Ala Moana Blvd in Waikiki. I never looked back.

First and foremost, I want to thank this community for all of the support it provides. Some other factors that really helped me were staying away from alcohol for the first 30 days, as well as using an app to track my progress.

To anyone in the early stages of quitting:
It only gets easier, really. You are all non-smokers now. You should all be proud of yourselves for making that leap, and avoid ruining all of the progress you've made.

As a non-smoker, when I walk by someone smoking a cigarette, the smell is disgusting and I can't believe I did that to myself. I now enjoy having a good workout routine and have great cardio and endurance. I also never have to worry about smelling like cigarettes when I'm at work, around people, etc. Oh, and my risk of heart disease and lung cancer has now returned to that of a normal non-smoker. So, there's that too.

Anyway, I'll keep this short. Thanks again and keep up the great work and strong mentality, everyone! You can do it!

My dog and my husband

Husband got a pack tonight. Why? Our dog is dying. It's not unexpected, she's almost 18 and it's time. But damn if it isn't hard. I did have a few tonight but am in bed right now while he is in the backyard digging a grave. She probably won't make it through the night. Tomorrow I'll have to tell our kids. Hoping husband finds some closure as he digs - he has been very tightly wound for some time now and keeps sabotaging my efforts to quit.

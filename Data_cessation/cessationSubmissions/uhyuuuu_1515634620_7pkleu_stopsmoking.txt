Almost 10 days in.

Been smoking for the last couple of years, I am pretty serious about quitting, but is it possible for me to still smoke when Im drinking,I drink like once a month. Is that possible for someone who spent the last 2 years smoking to become more of a social smoker?
Im sorry if I dont make sense, I didnt know how to frame the question.

Had a dream...

... that I started to smoke again, just like 1 cigarette a day. And then suddenly I was smoking more. Like gradually increasing. 

In the dream I felt so defeated, weak. A failure. 

But when I woke up I was so happy that wasn’t real life. Because I know that if I smoke again that’s exactly how I’m gonna feel and I definitely don’t want that. 

Keep it up everyone. It gets easier.

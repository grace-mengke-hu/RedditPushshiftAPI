Replace cigarettes with sparkling water

I gave up smoking 3 weeks ago and what really helped me when the cravings were the toughest was sparkling water. Every time i needed to smoke i drunk sparkling water and it really helped because the bubbles from the water create an full feeling in the mouth... is like anesthesia to the taste buds & mind that are desperately asking for a cigarette. 
Furthermore, lots of people when they give up smoking they get fat. However, if you replace the cigarette break with sparkling water you fulfill also the need to crunch something as it gives you a felling of satiety.
Hope it helps others too:)

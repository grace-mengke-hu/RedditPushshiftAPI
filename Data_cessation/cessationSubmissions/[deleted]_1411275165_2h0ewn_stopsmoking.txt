Nicotine free for 25 hours, hello smiley face!

Had one close call today, but I didn't cave.    
And holy shit did my mind ever recoil in horror when I said 'No! bad brain, shut up.'   
So far so good though, I'm holding onto the claims that this will get easier, and the hope that one day I won't see smoking as my go-to coping mechanism anymore.   
And I haven't killed anyone yet, yay!

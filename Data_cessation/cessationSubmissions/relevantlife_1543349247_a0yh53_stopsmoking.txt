This is the longest I have gone without a smoke in over a year. 9 days down. But I'm even dreaming about ciggs.

9 days down. 

It has been aight.  A few ups and downs. A few times when I thought I might break. But I haven't! 

However, I have been dreaming about cigarettes at night. And had one particularly violent nightmare, which is unusual for me. 

Anywho, keep not smoking, folks!

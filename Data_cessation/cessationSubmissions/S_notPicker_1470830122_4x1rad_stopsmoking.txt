The best time is "now" - Carr's The Easy Way

I desperately want to be a non-smoker. But 9 months ago I was a complete idiot and got a DUI. My court date is 8/18 (third date, it keeps being continued for various reasons). I know that was horrible to do, and I have not had a drink since. My BF, who is my main support in all life things, will be out of town for the 4 days before. I do not believe I am strong enough to to go smoke free with that combination, as I'm afraid. I had 4 days under my belt and cracked. My thought is to listen to the audiobook over and over and over to drill it into my head and then set my quit date for after the court date. Is that a bad idea? Looking for opinions. I am so ready but the fear and anxiety keep overwhelming me. Thanks for any insight----

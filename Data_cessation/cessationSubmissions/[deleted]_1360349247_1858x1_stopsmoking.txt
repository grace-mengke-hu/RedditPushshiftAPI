6 months already?! 

Hello fine air-breathers of /r/stopsmoking. Today apparently marks my sixth month without partaking of cancer-inducing death sticks. *Breathe deep*. It's a good feeling.

I really feel like my life has turned around in the past few months. I recently quit drinking (about to hit 2 weeks) and have been off caffeine for about 2 years. At this point, I can fairly confidently say that I am free of all addictive vices. And that's a damn good feeling to have.

If you are struggling, I can promise you that it gets easier. These days, I have no cravings and no desire to smoke. Being around it annoys me, but I no longer feel tempted to partake as I did early on.

Keep up the great work and remember that you are stronger than the tobacco lobby or any substance.

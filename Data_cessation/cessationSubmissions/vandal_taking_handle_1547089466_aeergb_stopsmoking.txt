Slipped at day 23. 1 turned into just going back to smoking. Trying again...

I posted here for the day 5 challenge on the Smoke Free app. Stayed strong for a bit but just didn’t make it. For me quitting smoking is hard and it sucks.
But I reset all my data and I am trying again.
I’m going to be compulsively reading this subreddit and posting any progress I make. 
You all are a great support and I’m going to take advantage of that. So thank you in advance.

Here’s to 25 minutes smoke free.
Never another puff, no matter what.

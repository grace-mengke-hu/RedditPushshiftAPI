It's been a week since I decided to quit smoking on a whim...

And it couldn't be going better! It's actually been 8 days and I saw that I just hit my 200 hour mark and was shocked. Those first 100 hours were tough! But it's flown by since then.

A couple things I've learned since quitting are:

1. Be kind to yourself. One thing I was worried about was gaining weight when I quit and it's one thing that always had deterred me from even trying. I have been on a lenient OMAD diet where I eat only one meal a day 5 days a week. Well since I knew I was going to be more on edge lately, I switched it up to where I eat my salad at lunch now to tide me over and skip the salad at dinner. But it's okay to have the occasional treat! You just quit one of the most addictive substances humans know, reward yourself!

2. Sugarless gum is your best friend. I have been gnawing on gum relentlessly since I've quit. It fixes my sweet tooth and is only 5 calories a stick, plus my breath constantly smells great especially since you no longer have that nasty smokers breath.

3. Go to the gym!!!! This is probably the biggest one. I did cardio atleast 3 times a week when I was smoking. Now I've been doing it atleast 5, and I get outside and walk for an hour at night when the cravings really kicked in. I noticed how much lower my BPM was after a 10 mile cycling session, and that I also did it in my fastest time so far, and that was right after coming off a 2 week foot injury.

I guess that's really it. Essentially the best things for me have been drinking tons of water, going hard with the cardio, chew gum, and be kind to yourself. Really anything to keep your mind busy will help with it, and before you know it a week is already gone. Thanks for this community, you guys have been a blessing with reading each of your stories.

I actually love quitting

Never posted on here before, so hi! Just random reflections on the last 2 weeks (and 20 years) of my life. Just things I've noticed, and maybe some things that will help others! In 16 days...

* I don't need an inhaler anymore
* My app says I've saved $244, or at least not flushed it down the drain
* I haven't had a zit for at least a week and my skin looks amazing already, didn't expect that to come for months
* I've been doing vigorous exercise the last few months and I think this helped me quit, I had a reason to be frustrated with my lack of stamina and an incentive to quit 
* My cardio ability practically doubled overnight, this afternoon I ran 5km in 35mins, and a few months ago I couldn't get up the stairs without getting breathless 
* I've had anxiety for years. I thought smoking helped me. It didn't. It made it much worse. I know this because the palpitations I had when I lay down to sleep disappeared after one day, and haven't returned in 16 days. I'm way less anxious, despite expecting to be off the charts while I was quitting
* I don't freak out when I feel the urge, because it's signalling my freedom from 20 years of agony and I know it will go away. It goes away in seconds, or definitely less than a minute anyway
* Even when an urge happens, I don't actually want to smoke, because I just fucking hate smoking so much. I can't tell you how much I fucking hated it before I stopped. I can easily stand around while someone is blowing it in my face, and I still don't want to smoke, I just feel sorry for them because they don't know how awesome they could feel compared to how they feel now
* I wasted about 2 hours a day smoking, and now I'm using it to actually do what I want to do instead of just thinking or talking about it. I never had enough energy to do the things I wanted because I was tired from carbon monoxide poisoning, and now I'm GETTING SHIT DONE YO
* Anyone who says **Allen Carr's books only work once: I hope you'll be very pleased to know you're dead wrong!** I read Easyway and only way to give up permanently, jumped the gun to quit even though he says not to (I still believed it helped me cope) and failed; but over the next couple of months I kept turning the concepts over in my mind. Then I read Easyway for women, and something snapped in my head, I don't know if anything was different about it or it was just giving the previous reads time to sink in, but this time is completely different and I am 100% sure I'm never going to smoke again. And I'm happy about it, that's the main difference.
* I started smoking because of a lack of confidence, and it didn't help. In fact, the years of dependence, the belief that I needed it to cope, and the utter shame in the last couple of years that was so unbearable I kept it a secret from almost everyone I know just shattered it even more. Guess what. I'm confident now. I feel like I'm hot, and I can look people in the eye and speak properly. What??? 
* The only thing I'm not really enjoying...smell. Why does everything SMELL SO MUCH. SO MANY SMELLS. Garbage, perfume, people's HAIR a metre away...I could do without being a bloodhound, does anyone know if this is just heightened and will ease off, or...is...is this life now?

Well that's about all, a lot of you will already know these things, just from a different perspective! And anyone who is secretly laughing that I am so sure now that I'm done...I can't explain it other than something has snapped and won't go back to the way it was, you'll know it when you're in the same frame of mind. Cheers guys

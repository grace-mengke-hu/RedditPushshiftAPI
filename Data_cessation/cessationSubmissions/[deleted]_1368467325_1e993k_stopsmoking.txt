I think this is it

So I've only been smoking for about a year and a half.  And within that time I've gotten to the point where some days I would smoke a full pack to myself.  So I rolled with my friends last saturday, and I know we smoked a ton of cigarettes cuz when I went outside the next morning: Butts Everywhere.  Also, I don't know what it was from necessarilly, but i was having trouble breathing the next morning as well.  So here I am, two days in, feeling really shitty from post rolling effects, as well as the stress from my work today (air conditioning broke in southern California, fuck me right?).  I'm all right today, so far at least, but I know that it will only get harder for the next few days. Also, I know I won't be able to stop chewing on my pens here for a while.  But like the title says, I think this is it.  I can do it this time.

4 Days and 12 Hours. How do I feel?

Fucking shitty, however, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. I smoked about a half a pack a day for 8 years give or take. I was just diagnosed with strep, so I feel even worse. Even the smell of smoke makes me wanna puke right now. I'm going to remember how I feel right now as a tool to combat all future urges.

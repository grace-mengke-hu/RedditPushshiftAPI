769 Days

769 days, it doesn't seem like that long ago.
I have to reset, I caved about two months ago and started smoking full time, but with a few large recent changes in my life, I felt like this needed to be one of them again.
So Brothers and Sisters, I reset back to zero and start my climb again.

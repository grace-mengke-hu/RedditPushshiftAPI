I just wanted to say thanks!

I've been an on an off smoker since I was ~13 years old with my highest being about a pack a day. The number of times I have quit to only fall off of the wagon after a couple of weeks is astounding. Being able to just flip to this subreddit whenever I've had the urge to "just have one" has been amazing and all of you are really the best.

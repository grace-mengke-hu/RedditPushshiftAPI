Nocturnal Panic Attacks When Quitting Smoking.

**Note:** Please ignore my badge. It's an old one. I'm on day 8 cold turkey. I need to reset it.

I really need to know I'm not going crazy right now and someone else has experienced what I experience when quitting nicotine.

Nocturnal panic attacks, or at least that's what I think these are. Had my first one about 9 years ago. Had them on and off, but whenever I stop smoking they are so intense that I'm scared to sleep.

Last night I was reading a book on the laptop at about 1.30am. I fell asleep at some point.

Suddenly I was awoken. I was still out of it and didn't know who I was, where I was or what was going on. But it was an intense impending doom feeling. I was tensing up my body. My mind was racing with pure panic and I thought I was honestly dying.

I also noticed my left leg and arm felt tingly. I'm not concerned though because I always lie on my arm and legs. Just noting what I can remember from this attack. It went away quickly once I was awake.

Anyway, I reached forward and put the password into the laptop (no idea how, I was honestly out of it). I noticed the time was 2.33am.

I started to come around and started calming. The impending doom feeling was decreasing and I started to relax my muscles. I checked my pulse ... normal. 65bpm.

And that's all I remember. 

Had around 500 of these in my lifetime, probably more. But I always notice they're super intense when quitting smoking and I don't actually know what they are. I have anxiety, and suffer regular panic attacks, so it's likely related.

These are not normal panic attacks. These nocturnal attacks make a bad panic attack seem like nothing. 

Anyone else know what I'm talking about or am I going mad lmao?

My friend offered me cigarettes

This afternoon my friend, who is also my roommate, knocked on my door and when I opened I saw her waving a pack of Indonesian cigarettes (which were my favourites), and offered me one. I told her "I don't smoke. I am 2 days and a half smoke free. I don't want it!" And she kept pushing and then instead of offering me one, she offered me the whole pack! I tried 100 ways to give her back the pack but she said just keep it, and if I didn't want to smoke it before leaving (I'm travelling next week), then give it back. 

I could smell the distinct smell of the cigarettes just from the pack but I don't have the desire to smoke them. Currently I am having a cuppa in the balcony and until 2 days ago, I'd always have a cigarette in my hand. But right now I don't feel like having one. I put the pack away in a drawer, I'll try giving it back again today. If not, I'll just give it back on the day I travel.

Patch for sensitive skin?

Tomorrow is day 1 of quitting! I'm anxious but trying to do as much as I can to prepare. I plan to use the patch to start, and I'm curious if anyone has a particular brand to try. 

I have always had pretty sensitive skin that's highly reactive. After reading a bunch of reviews claiming patches left rashes on people's bodies, I'm afraid to pick up this obnoxious physical side-effect while also dealing with the psychological effects of quitting. 

So, anyone got a recommendation for a brand that's easier on the skin? Thanks!

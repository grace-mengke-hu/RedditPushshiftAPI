Milestone

Reached one year smoke free today and I can hardly remember what it was like to smoke. The “cravings” do come from time to time, but they are only a  minir, minor inconvinience and cannot be compared to what it is like when you initally quit or even after 2-3 months, so it really does get easier, hang in there guys and keep up the good work! If you have any questions feel free to ask

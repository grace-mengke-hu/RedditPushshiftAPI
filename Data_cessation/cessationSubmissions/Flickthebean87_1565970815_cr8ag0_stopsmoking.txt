Celebrating 1 month smoke free! I’ve only made it to this point one other attempt in 14 years. Anyone with asthma still have issues with wheezing at this point?

Those of you out there debating on quitting or being hard on yourself for slipping up. I’ve had 3 failed attempts before this one. One a year ago which only lasted two weeks. One 8 years ago where I made it a month. That “one more pack” or “one cig.” Can throw you right back in. If you don’t slip up though don’t think “You already messed it up.”

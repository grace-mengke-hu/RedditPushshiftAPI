Day 6, No smokes

I made the decision to quit smoking cigarettes about two weeks ago. Was smoking half a pack a day, then smoked one for about three days. It's been 6 days since my last cigarette and I'm feeling great! Mood has improved, my appetite has balanced out a bit: I'm actually eating more than a meal a day!

I've "quit" before, but this time I'm determined to stay off them, to save money and possibly extend my life.

I experienced terrible headaches a few days after I quit smoking half a pack a day. After that, I had a cigarette and it tasted gross and smelled awful. My friend hasn't made the decision to quit yet and I can smell the stink on him. It really motivates me to stay off them.

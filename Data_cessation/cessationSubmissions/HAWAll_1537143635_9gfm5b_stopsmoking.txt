Day 3. Patch, gum, and Juul. Am I doing this wrong?

Part of me feels like using so many different nicotine products is actually just swapping addiction. The other part of me is telling me that even addition to any of these is better than smoking.

Been smoking almost 10 years (25yo), the worst part is kind of that I'm wondering what I'm going to do with myself during these little gaps of activity. What will I find to do that I look forward to as much as I did smoking a cigarette. Lotta emotions about this but I feel ready to quit.

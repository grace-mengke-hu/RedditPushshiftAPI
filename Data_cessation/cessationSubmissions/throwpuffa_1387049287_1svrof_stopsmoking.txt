Why am I not clearing my lungs more after 4 weeks?

Four weeks today and I just really haven't coughed up much over the last 28 days.  The smoker's cough lessened almost immediately, and while I occasionally need to clear my throat when speaking, I'm not clearing my lungs of gunk as I expected.  Is this weird?  I keep picturing impacted lungs filled with years of fossilized, un-expectorated mucus that's just going to stay there and kill me.  Gross and a little overly dramatic, but true.  Any thoughts?

EDIT: I smoked for about 17 years total, most recently for 4 1/2 years after a 9 month quit (my longest quit ever).

EDIT:  These variety of responses are reminding me that everyone's body is different and I probably shouldn't worry so much.  Not coughing is a *good* thing.  Thanks to all of you.

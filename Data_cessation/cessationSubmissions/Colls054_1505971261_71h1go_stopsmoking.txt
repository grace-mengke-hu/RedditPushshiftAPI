47 days

Officially on day 47 of quitting, honestly some days I do still crave a cigarette but then I remember how much I used to smell and all the money and time wasted on stupid things. I also realized that it’s a mental game of thinking I’d never be “less stressed” or “less angry” without them, but realistically I was just using cigarettes as a vice instead of dealing with how I was feeling at the time. If you’re thinking of quitting you can do it if you’re ready!

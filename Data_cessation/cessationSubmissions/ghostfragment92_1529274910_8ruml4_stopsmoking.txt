Passed 3 months now and hung out with my smoker friends for the first time with no inclination for tobacco

I hit the 100 day mark this past Wednesday and treated myself accordingly. On Saturday some friends were having a BBQ so I tagged along, about half the people there were still puffing away but not once did I feel any pressure or craving to engage. Something I didn't think I would have been able to do even just a few months ago.

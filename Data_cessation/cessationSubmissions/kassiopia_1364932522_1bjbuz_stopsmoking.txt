Ex-smokers: how did you do it?

This also applies to ex-pot smokers. Im looking for personal stories, things that helped you get through the first 48 hrs especially. But also how to deal with social situations where smoking is the norm. Things that worked, attempts that failed. How many times you tried to quit before succeeding?
 Im 28, have been smoking since i was 12, and pot since 14. Its about time i think.  Ant honest, constructive comments appreciated.

Edit: starting tomorrow morning, i will be no longer smoking cigarettes. After reading some of your comments, i really do think i am finally ready to give this up. Cold turkey. Its weird, i dont even feel nervous about it, like i have every other time. 

Edit 2: its been about 36 hours since my last smoke now. Its hard, but im doing it. My roomate still smokes in the common areas, and surprizingly, its not bothering me too much.  I really think this is the time i succeed!!

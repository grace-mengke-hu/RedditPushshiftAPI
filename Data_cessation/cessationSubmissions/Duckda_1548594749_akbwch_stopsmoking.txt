The First Step?

Hey everyone,
I recently decided for the sake of my own health and relationships that I should quit smoking. I also figured I’m not yet ready. I used to be very into health and fitness &amp; never touched it but the moment I inhaled a cigarette I realised how “great” it was. I miss being the previous healthy person I was. How do I stop? Whats the very first step to take? 
I noticed the moment I taste alcohol my whole quit plan drops altogether so how should I combat it whilst drinking at the same time? I’m extremely disappointed in the decision I made and hope to improve. How can I do this?

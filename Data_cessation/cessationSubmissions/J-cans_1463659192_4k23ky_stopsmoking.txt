Little victories

Sometimes quitting is about the big wins, those occasions that are so monumental and other times it's those little buggers that put a smile on your face. I had one of the latter variety that I'd like to share. In 7-11 this morning getting coffee (which is a victory in itself as that's where I used to buy smokes WITH my coffee everyday) I was at the counter paying for my coffee. The transaction was finished and as I turned to walk out I heard the guy behind me (also getting coffee) say "can I have a pack of 72 silvers please". I smiled and thought to myself "I'm glad it's not me anymore". big smiles.

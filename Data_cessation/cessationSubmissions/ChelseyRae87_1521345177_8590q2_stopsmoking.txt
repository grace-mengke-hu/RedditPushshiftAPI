Made it through my sister's bday party!

I drank margaritas, sat around a table where everyone else was smoking, my brother was a total dick and thought it was funny to try and convince me to smoke and blow smoke in my face even but i never even wanted one. I thought it smelled terrible, and i found it astounding to see just how much they all smoked all night. There was never a time that there wasn't a cigarette lit. I feel a cough coming on just from being around it. 

I'm going to take a long hot shower, put on some clean pjs, and watch a movie to celebrate. Feeling so great to have had such a great time tonight. We played Cards Against Humanity, except my kit is all raunchy, hilarious, and awful expansion packs so it was just the funniest hour ever! Feeling great closing out day 13. 

For those of you just starting out, i promise it gets better and soon. I still struggle with occasional cravings ( some last 15 seconds, some seem to stretch on for an hour or more) but all are manageable and bearable. I'm simoly existing as a non smoker. Feels so wonderful!!!

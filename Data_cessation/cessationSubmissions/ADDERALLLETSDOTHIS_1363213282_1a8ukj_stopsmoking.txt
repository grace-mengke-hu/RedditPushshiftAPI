Today is the day.

I am a fairly light smoker ( never more than 5 a day) and have been for 6 years. I lie to myself constantly that since I don't smoke a pack a day it's okay. I have come to realize I'm not fooling anyone or myself for that matter. I hate not having the lung capacity I used to, always smelling like tobacco smoke and worst of all being a slave to nicotine. I threw out the rest of my pack today and want to quit forever. I quit last year and lasted two weeks but stupidly hoped back on the cigarette train. Help me R/stopsmoking, I have the willpower to not buy another pack but I need advice on how to deal with the dreaded withdrawal. Any activities or things you recommend I do to ease the withdrawal is greatly appreciated. Herbal supplements, daily routines, foods to eat, etc. I am all ears for suggestions. Also has anyone had any success with omega 3 supplement pills to ease withdrawal? I take them sometimes and believe they help my mood stay positive.

Question about lung recovery and working out

Today marks the 644th day I have been smoke free.  Quitting was easily the best decision I have ever made but it is also the hardest thing I've ever done.  I was an 11 year 1+ pack a day smoker.

Due at least in part to quitting I have decided to pick up a number of sports over the last few years including running and cycling.  Unfortunately when I reach high levels of physical activity I can still feel the tar and left-over sticky feeling in my lungs.  This didn't happen prior to starting to smoke in high school where I was a very competitive athlete.  I usually cough and it really makes working out very difficult at times.  I want to hear about others experiences in this regard.  How long did it take your lungs to recover post-quitting?  Have there been any studies conducted on lungs and exercise in ex-smokers?  Any other insight is greatly appreciated.

And if you're reading this and have just began your quit journey, don't give up, you'll be a better person for it.  It only gets easier from here.

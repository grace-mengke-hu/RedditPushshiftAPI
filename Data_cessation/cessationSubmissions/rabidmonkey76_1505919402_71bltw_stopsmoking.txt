And. Here. We. Go.

Been smoking for 23 years. Some back-of-the-envelope math tells me that works out to over 168,000 cigarettes. Placed end-to-end, that's about 14km. In dollar terms, it's over $48,000.

I've set fire to and inhaled a pretty nice car.

I've torched a year of tuition at an excellent college for my child(ren? - Going for the first ultrasound today - prayers/good thoughts appreciated!). 

I'm using the patch, and it has kept me from breaking my house or injuring myself - both of which happened last time I tried to quit cold turkey.

Wish me luck!

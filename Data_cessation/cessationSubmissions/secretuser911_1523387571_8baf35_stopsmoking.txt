Bloated with no appetite

Hey All! I’m on day 4. My cravings today have been much less but I know they will still go up and down. 

This is my second serious quit (with many attempts that were not so serious in between) and for all of those quits my appetite shot it and sugar was the only thing that made me happy. 

This time around though - I’m having no appetite, yet I’m still stupidly bloated and fat feeling. 

I mentioned before that spicy things had been helping ease my tension so I’m wondering if that has anything to do with my lack of appetite (I bought cayenne pepper to use in tomatoe juice vs putting in straight hot sauce to watch sodium). 

I can stop drinking water, coffee, and a little juice but I still feel like fat even though I’m hardly eating due to no appetite. 

I’m going to get some ginger tea and probiotics later but has anyone else experienced this?

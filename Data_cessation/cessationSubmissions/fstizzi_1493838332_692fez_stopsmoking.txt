Day 3

3rd day and I don't like it a bit. I'm 29 years old and this isn't my first try. I use the "smoke free" app and it always recommends going to reddit "stopsmoking" which I never did before... I have to admit I've been here for everyone od the last three days and it really seems to boost my confidence :)

I think I need to confess something. Everytime I get off the cigarettes and I feel like I conquered it. I start off with enjoying a couple of joints. And I always come back to the cigarettes right after my stash is gone. I don't know what I can do about it. I really enjoy smoking some weed from time to time... anyone knows the problem? Is it foolish to think I can make it work to smoke pot but no cigarettes? I really would hate stopping to smoke weed but I don't wanna smoke cigarettes anymore... 


I even bought myself a little portable vaporizer but to be honest it's not the real deal...

Btw I smoke for 12 years a pack a day started with 17...

Day 2

Getting up for work was really hard today without my morning smoke. But I'm trying to remember that morning smoke wasn't a privilege. It was just me feeding the addiction with the price of being able to taste my breakfast. Not really a great tradeoff. I have a feeling there will be lots to do at work today. Im not sure if this will make it easier or harder.

Last night cravings got annoying near bedtime but I just kept in mind they are temporary and they went away. Just have to tough it out for a week or two.

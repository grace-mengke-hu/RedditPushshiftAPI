Star me up! 30 days and counting

What I've learned so far:

1) Take it day by day. Don't think about forever, it's too daunting. I'm starting to think about smoking less and less, but when it comes up I always tell myself that for that particular moment/craving, I'm not going to smoke. Whatever happens after that is irrelevant.

2) Create new habits. I started hitting the gym, meditating, writing a journal and practicing guitar again. 

3) Read and understand the addiction. The more I educated myself on nicotine addiction (and addiction in general) the more I'm able to understand and rationalize what's happening to me. This was critical during the second week, when my nicotine junkie was trying to convince me that my life sucked and that I was a useless slag without smokes.

4) Find support. This subreddit has been amazingly valuable and motivating.

I also found a secret trick for the first week: Alan Carr's book in audiobook format. I would listen to it ALL THE TIME and as I was going through the worst of the physical symptoms. There's nothing like a brit telling you that you're a pathetic and disgusting person to motivate you to quit ;)

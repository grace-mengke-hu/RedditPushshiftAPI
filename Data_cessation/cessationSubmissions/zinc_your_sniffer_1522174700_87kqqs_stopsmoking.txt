Quitting even a light habit is tough!

I smoke a pack a week, and am able to stick to that amount and have done for many years now. I know I should quit, but I really, really like those 2 cigs a day. Sometimes none a day and then sometimes 5. But I buy one pack on the same day every week. I've always thought that if I keep to that amount I probably am not doing a whole lot of damage, but I think I'm kidding myself. Am I just a complete pansy, or is quitting a pack a week habit really this difficult?? I'm into day 3 and it's on my mind BIG TIME right now.

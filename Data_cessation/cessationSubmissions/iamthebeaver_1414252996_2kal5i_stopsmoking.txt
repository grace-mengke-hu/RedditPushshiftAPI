16 years a slave

I decided yesterday after reading Allan Carr's Easy way to stop smoking that I am done with smoking. I am ready to break free and start enjoying life as a non smoker. My wife has been begging me for years to quit and honestly I feel like this will be the time that I am able to stay away from the cigarettes for good. 

I just have to keep reminding myself that I am not missing out on anything by not smoking.

Stare the beast in the eyes

I'm a few days smoke free (quit for one month last year but fell back onto the wagon) I've found that besides toking on a vape, the second best tool for quitting is not trying to avoid thinking about wanting a smoke which is what I've done in the past where I've failed. I find that when I want a smoke it's better if I sit there and consciously give attention to the craving rather than trying to brush it away, usually this means the craving passes and I can think about how it is just a silly addiction nagging me chemically???

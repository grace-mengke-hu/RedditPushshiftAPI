The funny and weird stuff

This is such a difficult and serious undertaking but ...

What are some of the comical things that have happened relating to your quit?

The other day I was walking through my home office and suddenly found myself heading towards my desk looking at a pen I thought was a cigarette in a certain light. I started laughing about how my subconscious and addiction saw what it wanted and steered me toward s it. ( I didnâ€™t even have a craving before or after) Bizarre lol

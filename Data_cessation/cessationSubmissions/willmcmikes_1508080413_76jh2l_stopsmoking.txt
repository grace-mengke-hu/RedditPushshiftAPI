Stopping smoking and anxiety

Hi everyone, stopped smoking just over 2 months ago (cold turkey) and after about 2 weeks I started developing some major anxiety that hasn't seemed to go away and is making me very worried and upset. Has anyone else experienced this? Could the stopping of cigarettes bring about some underlying anxiety that was masked by the cigarettes? I saw my doctor about this and he prescribed me antidepressants to deal with the anxiety but I dont wanna take them if it's not necessary

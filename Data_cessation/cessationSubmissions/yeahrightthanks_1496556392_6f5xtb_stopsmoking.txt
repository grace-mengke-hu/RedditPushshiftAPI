Trying to help my dad quit smoking! Any vape model recommendations?

My dad is in his fifties and smokes around 5 cigarettes a day, so not much, but still a bad habit he can't seem to quit.

I've read everywhere that switching to a vape helps a lot, so I'm wondering if you guys know any models that you can recommend? I also have no idea of the different vape parts and components, so if someone can briefly tell me or point me to a link I'd appreciate it :) Also, do I get a vape with nicotine in it or no nicotine?

He's tried other quitting techniques but they just don't seem to work. 

Thanks!

3 days in after 8 years of smoking. 

I've smoked my entire young adult life, since I was 15. I've quit probably a dozen times; 3 months was my longest. I spent the last two weeks of 2012 coughing up bullshit and dealing with sinus issues. I woke up three days ago, deciding I was finished. I want this to be the end.  
  
Any tips for replacing the constant smoke breaks at work? D:

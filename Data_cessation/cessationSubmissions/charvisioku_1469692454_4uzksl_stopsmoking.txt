No cravings just feel ill

I expected to have really bad cravings around the third day but it's been sort of odd. I haven't had a strong craving since day 2 but I feel like I have some kind of bug. I'm pretty positive it's to do with me quitting but I was just wondering if it's normal to feel really weak and tired despite getting a reasonable night's sleep? I also feel like I've suddenly developed anger issues which I know is normal - I flipped out big time at my fiancee this morning because he's also tetchy and he said "Well I'm sorry princess" when I said I'd make my own lunch. I had to go up to our room and punch my pillow to calm down - I'm normally a really relaxed person (including before I started smoking) and it's rare that I get angry so that was scary. I know feeling upset and angry for no reason is normal but is that level of intensity something to worry about? I can calm back down by gritting my teeth and taking a couple of deep breaths, the pillow thing was just faster I guess.

This is rough. One thing it has done is convince me I'm doing the right thing though; if nicotine makes me feel like this when I don't have it for a few days I'm done with smoking. This is bullshit.

Sorry guys just really angry today. Grr.

Also, anyone got advice on this? I work in a sales environment so I absolutely can not be sitting here seething away in a little ball of rage all day.

New here!

Been thinking a lot lately and with the money I spend and the health I'm consequencing by smoking, I've come to terms that it's probably time to quit. I smile American Spirits, so they really break the bank for me seeing as they're around 7.60 to 8$ here and I smoke a little over a pack a day. So that's about 54$ give or take in a week. Never mind the health I'm destroying. 

I also already own a vape but just was wondering if anyone had any solid advice for quitting as I've tried before and could only go 24 hours and that was tough

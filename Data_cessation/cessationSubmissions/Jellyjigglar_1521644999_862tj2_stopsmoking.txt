How I quit - Hopefully this will inspire someone.

I smoked my final cigarette on 11/12/16 - I was 22 years old. Started at 13, moved up to a pack a day at 14. Then at some point I started packing lips of Grizz mint. Before I quit I was smoking two packs a day and packing lips. My choice of poison was Lucky Strikes &amp; Marlboro Reds.

I tried to quit many, many times. Often not lasting a week and relapsing whilst drunk, on drugs, angry, or depressed. The “cravings” were unbearable. Tried everything under the sun: Gum, meds, cutting down, Allen Carr, hypnosis. Nothing worked. But one thing that did happen over the years is that I slowly grew to resent smoking.

Then one day after I smoked a cigarette I lied down on my bed and debated if I should go out and smoke another or stay inside and pack a lip. It was at that moment when a thought popped into my head: “No matter what I do, I will never be satisfied.”

So I threw them in the trash and that was it. I haven’t had a craving since. I got drunk 2 days after I quit and didn’t have a craving. All my friends are smokers and I never have cravings. I was done. A couple months back I took some drags from a cigar a few times while drunk and instead of before where I would frantically rush to the store to buy a pack I just... didn’t.

So yeah that’s my story. I realized what happened was that day, unlike every other quitting attempt, I fully realized how much I hate smoking. I didn’t just say that in my head like all the years before but I felt it deep in my bones. I truly believe I convinced myself to enjoy cigarettes and I undid the wiring and realized how unenjoyable the act of smoking really is.

So there’s my story! I don’t know if sharing this will inspire/help anyone but I thought I’d just throw this out there.

Where to start?

Hello. 

I recently quit drinking (over a month ago) and want to quit smoking too. I've heard good things about Allen Carr's book, and actually have a ( probably illegal) digital copy. I was thinking of ordering the print version. My mom is a smoker, and gets very defensive about it. She also smokes in the room next to mine. I have to walk through it to get to the other part of the house. Also I go to AA and we often sit outside and chain-smoke. I have an E-cig, but I just want to quit it all. I really want and need to quit, and not sure if my addict mind is just making excuses or what. Any help is appreciated. Thank you!

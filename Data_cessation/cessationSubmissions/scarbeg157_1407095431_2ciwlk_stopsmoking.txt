2.5 weeks in, why is this getting harder?!

I was feeling semi confident at the end of week 2. And now I am seriously doubting my ability to stick this out. I don't feel like it's getting easier, I don't feel any healthier or any increased energy or any of the things they say you should feel. I just feel like I have had to be constantly on guard and unable to relax for the last 2.5 weeks and it's driving me crazy.

Edit: I think part of the problem today is that I had a dream last night where I smoked. It was *crazy* realistic and I woke up thinking it was real. The sense of relief I felt in those moments, before I realized it was a dream, when I thought I had already fucked up and it was all over and I could smoke again, was so intense and wonderful, it is making this a lot harder.

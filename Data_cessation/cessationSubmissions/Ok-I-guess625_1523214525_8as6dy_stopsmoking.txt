Having a hard time

I really want to smoke right now. I know it's psychology, not withdraw based right now. All of my triggers are lit up:
I'm home, my husband and son are out, I'm stressed and studying, I ate a huge meal so I'm full but also feeling bad about myself. Ugh. Luckily I can just do nothing since there aren't any in the house...but it's so hard, I feel like I'm on day two again.

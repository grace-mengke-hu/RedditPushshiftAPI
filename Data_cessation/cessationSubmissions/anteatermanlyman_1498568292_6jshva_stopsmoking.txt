boyfriend is almost a month quit!

My boyfriend has been trying to quit for a while now, and I'm proud to say that he is almost a month quit coming friday. We're both trying! I've been failing a lot since I relapsed a couple years ago, but he is completely free! I'm hoping he continues and we live long and healthy lives together. I know it gives me hope for myself, as well.

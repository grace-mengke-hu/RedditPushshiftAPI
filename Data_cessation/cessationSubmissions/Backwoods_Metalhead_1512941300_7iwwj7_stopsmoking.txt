Day 7 without a cancer stick

I mainly just lurk Reddit, but I had to share how proud of myself I am. I smoked a pack a day of Marlboro Blacks for 6 years. A couple months after I started smoking cigs, I had a panic attack for the first time ever! People with anxiety know that panic attacks suck. Especially the first time when you have no idea whats going on. Well 3 weeks ago I had another attack for the first time since then, and I was scared to smoke fearing that it would make it 10X worse. Now I'm not gonna sit here and say that nicotine gave me anxiety or whatever. But I think that it could have something to do with it. Besides, smoking has been making me feel like complete trash lately. Heart palpitations, shortness of breath,etc. and I relate those things to anxiety by obsessing over it. The only negative outcome I've had so far after quitting is increase in appetite and restlessness, but that seems to have subsided a bit. I feel alot happier in general as well. Good luck with anyone else out there trying to quit!

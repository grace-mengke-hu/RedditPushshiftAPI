Hey guys, I have to take a forced break for a while and looking for some kind of helpful advice. Thanks.

I have been vaping (counts as smoking right?) with 24mg e-juice for the last 8 months. Circumstances require me to go cold turkey immediately. Not sure if this is the right place for this post but I just would like a little comfort or anything you great people have to offer me. Thank you.

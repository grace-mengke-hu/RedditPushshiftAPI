I keep smoking 1 cigarette a day. Wtf?

Smoke-free-ish for 3 days cold turkey.

In the late afternoon I get a little tired and a bit bummed out, so I allow myself one cigarette (which I very lightly inhale, and let most of it burn by itself) and it perks me back up.

1. I know I'd be better off without it, but what's my deal? I've heard smoking does some dopamine shit.
2. Is this kind of behavior common?
3. What kind of health gains am I missing out on because I keep doing this? I'd like for my cilia to grow back at some point.

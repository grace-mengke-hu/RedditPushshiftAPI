Not going to smoke anymore.

I had quit smoking last December 31st and did not touch it again till July this year. Since then I have been smoking on the regular. This is a note I have written for myself after smoking one today.
The note goes:

I have just smoked a cigarette and I feel like shit about it. I have had cancer and my kidneys are weak. I never want to be in that position again - especially after being so close to death. I cannot undergo that pain again.

I had promised myself that I would smoke until December 31 - and I have broken that promise often and flagrantly since then. I need to stick to it. And I will because I am strong. I don't want these death sticks to be the end of me.

I am too young to throw my life away. I remember how broken mom and dad were when I was diagnosed with cancer. I cannot put them through this again - I need to be more responsible for myself. 

I will not smoke anymore. For myself.

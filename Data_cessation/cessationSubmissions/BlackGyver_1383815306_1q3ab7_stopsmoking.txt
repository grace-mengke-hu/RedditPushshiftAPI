Third attempt, three days in ... any tips?

I decided to stop, again, this time because I was starting to have a really bad smoker's cough since I've had that flu two-three weeks ago. I take some occasional NiQuitin to deal with the cravings, but the psychological aspect has always been the most annoying to deal with. Any tips? Have you tried e-cigarettes? What can I do to make it easier?

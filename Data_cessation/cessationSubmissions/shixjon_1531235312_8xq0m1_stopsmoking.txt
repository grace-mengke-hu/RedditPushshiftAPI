Week 1 down!

I have tried to quit several times before and have failed each time, but I feel like this may be the end, finally! I am 24 now and had been smoking since I was 18, and tried to quit cold turkey and using Chantix, both being unsuccessful in the past. This time, I took Chantix for 5 days, stopped smoking on day 5, took Chantix another 3 days, and had to stop because my nightmares and mood swings were becoming unbearable. Since I stopped taking it I have only had 1 craving and haven’t had any more mood swings. The only issue I’m coming across is not finding things to fill all of the free time I have now!

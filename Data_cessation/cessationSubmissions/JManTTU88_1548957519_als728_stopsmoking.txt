NRT Options for &lt;10 Cigs a Day Smoker

I just found this subreddit and I'm looking forward to taking this journey with y'all. 

&amp;#x200B;

As the title says, I recently picked up a smoking habit (within the last 2 years). I smoke on average 6-10 cigarettes a day, depending on stress level. Ive tried to quit several times over the years, but always coming back. Recently, I've only made it a few days before having the craving to smoke again. Being this dependent has truly opened my eyes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ive been doing some research on NRT's and I'm confused as to what I should try. The broad consensus I've seen is that NRT options aren't usually recommended for those who smoke less than 10 cigarettes a day and are more for heavy smokers. They suggest someone in my situation quitting cold turkey, but I don't think I can do that without some sort of assistance.

I've seen lots of people use the SmokeFree app and have already downloaded it to start. What do you all recommend for my situation? What are your experiences with the patch, gum, or lozenge?  Any help will be greatly appreciated.

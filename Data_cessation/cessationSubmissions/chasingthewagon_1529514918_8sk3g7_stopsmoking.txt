Investing my cigarette money

I am 65 days into my quit and I'm feeling great.  After about 3 or 4 weeks, there are days I hardly even think about smoking.

My health and wealth were the two reasons I wanted to quit.  I was spending almost $200 per month on the damn things.  A lot of people set their cigarette money aside in a jar once they quit.  I decided to take that one step further and invest it.

I set up automatic deductions of $200 each month into a brokerage account.  This will automatically be invested into low cost index funds each month.  Instead of that money working to kill me, it's now working to make me more money.

This investing is in addition to the 10% of my salary I already stash away in a 401k.  With compounding interest, who knows how much that money could turn into over the years (I am 32).  Now that I've quit smoking,  maybe I can actually live long enough to enjoy that money in retirement!

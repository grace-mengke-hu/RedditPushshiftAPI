The magical 1 year milestone

Just like most smokers I never thought I'd make it, but here I am after over 1 year of freedom. I was looking forward to this post but now I really don't have much to say. 

I guess the important thing I can say is to always remember the reason you quit. And run over it in your mind if you have a craving, heck scream it out loud if it helps you. Just remember you quit because YOU wanted to.

I'm also grateful to my [dog](http://500px.com/photo/71532615/teacher-by-ninina) because he got he through the thick of it. I quit 1 day before bringing the 2 month old pup home. I figured it was as good a time as any to quit - probably the best decision I've ever made.

I hope you are all enjoying your freedom as much as I am :)

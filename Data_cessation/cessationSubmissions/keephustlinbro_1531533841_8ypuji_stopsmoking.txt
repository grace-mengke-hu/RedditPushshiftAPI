why do some ex-smokers cough black stuff and some don't?

this has to be one of the strangest phenomenons ive heard of.. for me whenever i quit smoking a few weeks later i begin coughing up the black stuff which I hear is a good thing because it means the cilia is repaired and your lungs are starting to clear out.. some people though report never coughing up black stuff.. wtf?

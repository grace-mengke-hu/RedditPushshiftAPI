Today is my first day without smoking

I'm during a bike trip from Lille to Lisbon. I met a guy who convinced to stop. I'm 19 and I've been smoking for a year. The temptation is huge because because it's cheap in Spain but I will succeed. I need to. 

He told me "If you would, it could be your last pack". I finished it yesterday and I won't buy a new one. 

Wish me luck and thanks for all your interesting text and publication, it's good to read you !

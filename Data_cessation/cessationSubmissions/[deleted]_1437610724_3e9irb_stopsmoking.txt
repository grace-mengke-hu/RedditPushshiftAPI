Second time I'm stopping, and I hope for good.

Hello r/stopsmoking! 

After putting off quitting smoking (for the second time) and telling myself 'I'll just get to the end of this pack and be done with it', I finally finished that pack (even though I have told and lied to myself countless times in the past that I was going to do this). Though a stupid goal to have, I found no point in putting to waste a cigarette which I have already bought, and yet I kept purchasing them. Oh the irony. I should have just been done with smoking from the moment I started to think 'This is killing, my heart is begin to hurt and I can no longer continue supporting this lifestyle.' I believe I can finally quit for good this time. 

My first time quitting was December last year as I had been smoking, on estimate, ten cigarettes a day for a year straight and not only did it damaging me physically, it damaged me financially. After the headaches, boredom and insomnia subsided (I believe it took me three weeks), I continued smoke free until the beginning of March when I began to feel more depressed with myself and wondered 'What's the point in stopping? I don't particularly care for myself any more and nor does anyone else.' Of course, I was wrong but this was the catalyst for me to start smoking again. 

Now that I am feeling a lot better and more confident in myself, I want to quit again, permanently; I now know what triggers me to want that cigarette when I'm reaching for the packet:

- Cravings. The obvious adversary in any smokers battle to quit. 
- Boredom. When I have nothing to do I try to entertain myself by lighting up.
- Cost. At just under Â£10 for a packet of 20 straights, I cannot afford to continue smoking. I could roll and cut my costs, but it is cheaper to quit all together. 
- Loneliness. Though not really an issue any more, I smoked for the social element of being outside and striking up a conversation with a random person whether it be at University or a club. 
- Depression. Though I hate to admit it, I smoked for the idea of shortening my lifespan as though I was not suicidal, I did not care much for living. This phase of my life has passed me and I hope for good.  

Thank you for reading, I look forward to engaging the community. 

Edit: I would like to add I quit the first time in a flat of people who did not smoke. Currently, I am back at home with my mother who is a smoker for the next few months. I do not know if being around her will help me stop and though she wants to quit, I do not know how to go about helping her quit too.

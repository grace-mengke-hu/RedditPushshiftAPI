Quit 1 week ago and tempted to throw in the towel

Last Friday, I quit smoking. I've been really committed up until this point. I've been smoking a pack a day for 9 years. I've been coping by going outdoors every time I had a craving. This entire week I have felt incredibly weak, sore, and tense. All I want is relief. I know the smoke wouldn't alleviate the tension in my back, but I know that first drag would be like sitting in a nice recliner. 

I'm feeling weak both physically and mentally. This really stinks. It's affected my work. I now shake whenever I'm serving people food. I'm just always incredibly tense.

I quit 3 years ago when I found out I was pregnant. I was smoke free for 8 months. I remember not even feeling benefits from quitting, and desperate for my baby to come out so I could enjoy smoking again. I breastfed for 6 weeks before I couldn't take it anymore. I still feel I failed in that department. 

The only real reason I'm moving forward is for my son. I initially quit because, at 24 years old, I was developing a smoker's cough. Now, with my moods and the pain of quitting, I'm convincing myself it's not worth it. Help, anyone?

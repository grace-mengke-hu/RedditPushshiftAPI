Got a rash from the patch, used e-cigarettes for about a week, but I plowed through and I'm over 2 weeks out and feeling ok.

I mean, don't get me wrong, there are moments when I want to smoke, but I make a commitment and I'm not breaking my word.  I just keep reminding myself that the anxiety I feel in those moments is temporary.

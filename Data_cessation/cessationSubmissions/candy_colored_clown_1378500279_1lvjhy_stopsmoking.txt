151 days

I don't really count the days anymore... I used to think a cigarette would relax me but now I feel like it's the exact opposite. There's nothing more relaxing than just breathing. I smoked for 5 years, which included periods of intense chain-smoking. I want to let you all know that quitting is totally possible.You just have to always be willing to go just one more day. Treat yourself when you hit certain benchmarks. Buy yourself something nice when you hit a month and three months. I'm proud to call myself a nonsmoker again.

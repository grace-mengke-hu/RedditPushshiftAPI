Me 2 nicotine 0

I won my second really significant battle with nicotine. The war is still not over but i have two up on nicotine. However the scoring rules are different for nicotine and me. I take one drag and all the points i build up are lost. It's back to 0-0. But right now that's not important, it's time for me to bask in the glory of my victory in the second significant battle with nicotine. You might ask what's the first. The first is when i regained my lost weight, color on my skin and teeth, my natural odor etc etc that i lost to smoking. .came after 2-3 weeks. Now after 70 days, i have another victory. I dreamt i was smoking, felt really guilty during the dream. Woke up with guilt and then felt orgasmic levels of relief. You dreamt you were smoking, how's that a victory you might ask. Dreaming is subconscious, even in my subconscious state i felt guilty, re affirming that i hate cigarettes. Psychologically it means that the rational part of the brain has pounded the diseased addicted parts of my brain into such a desperate corner that, their power over me now is limited to making me dream about smoking once in 2 months, earlier what was it? Yeah their power was enough to make me light up 10 times a day. It's a sign. A symbol, a new memory that is telling you not to smoke. My fellow warriors whenever you dream about losing to nicotine, it means you are winning against your demons. Give out another battle cry, charge at it and continue to pound it to dust

How much damage after 6 years?

Not looking for medical advice. Was just wondering what you guys think. I'm not as fit as a non smoker, but i do have an athletic build and play moderate intensity sports. Like surfing and soccer. So just what has my almost pack a day habit over 6 years cost me in the lung department.

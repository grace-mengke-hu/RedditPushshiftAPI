2 months and 5 days cigarettless! Just got a job offer and super duper want a celebratory cigarette.

As I sit here in anxiety and am awaiting the final paperwork I want nothing more than to distract to myself with a smoke. I know it’s pointless and a made up ritual but gosh darn it, it’s hard sometimes. 
I also had to put in my two weeks notice to current employer and I feel real bad leaving my past team. Too many emotions right now!

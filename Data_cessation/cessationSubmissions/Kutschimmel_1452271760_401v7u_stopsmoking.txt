What to offer in return?

So I talked to my girlfriend about her quitting smoking. Now I myself never was a smoker, I smoked sometimes but never really got 'addicted' if you will. She knows I want her to quit, but she simply doesn't want to quit herself. 

I'm not going to be 'that guy' that asks her to quit for me. She needs to want to quit herself for it to actually work. So I asked her, what would you like from me in return? She didn't really know anything and neither did I.

So here I am, what should I offer in return to 'seduce' her into quitting smoking. I know it's a little unfair but hey, I just really want her to quit!

Was currently thinking about taking her out for dinner every month, anyone out there with better ideas or even things they had themselves?

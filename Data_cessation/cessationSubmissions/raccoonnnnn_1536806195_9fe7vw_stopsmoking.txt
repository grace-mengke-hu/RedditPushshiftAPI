Day 19 Mission

19 days smoke free! I am a non- smoker!

Today’s mission on the Smoke Free app is to write down all the things that have worked so far and add a little detail about why you think they did. 

Things that have helped so far: While driving, I chew gum. When I’m stressed, I take an anti-anxiety medication (prescribed by my doctor), and I go to to hot Pilates because it helps me breathe better and take the edge off of wanting a cig.

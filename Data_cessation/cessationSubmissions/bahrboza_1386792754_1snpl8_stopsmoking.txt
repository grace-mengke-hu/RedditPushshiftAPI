First Post and I'm Excited

Hi, I'm typically a lurker, but I'm about to quit myself and thought it would be smart (and enjoyable) to share the experience with this subreddit.  I just finished "Easyway," and while I read it once before it seems everything is clicking together a lot more this time.  I've only been smoking for three years, but I'm about to enter my last semester of college and I want to start becoming the adult I want to be.  I've only read a handful of posts, but each one gives me a new charge of confidence.  Thanks for that :) My quit day is Monday, wish me luck!

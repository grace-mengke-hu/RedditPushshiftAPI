71 hours since I have taken a puff

I am on the patch and gum. Today I feel like it’s been a really hard day. I don’t feel like caving but my emotions have been all over the place. Angry, tears eyed at times and absolutely no motivation. Don’t want to leave my house or be around people. I have planted my butt on my couch all day and have read everyone’s stories. All these stories are inspiring me so much and I know I can do this. The emotional rollercoaster today has been a bit much lol

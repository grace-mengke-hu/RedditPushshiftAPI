I am tobacco free as of June 2nd, 2014 at 12:37 am and proud of it

Just woke up the morning after smoking a pack and a half the day before at the casino, saw 9 cigs stating me in the face and I threw them away. I got an e cig and am happy to be off of cigarettes. Was much easier than I thougt it'd be for me after smoking a pack every 2 days for 4 years. 

I used to come here but stopped, figured I'd stop by and let you all know I did it :D

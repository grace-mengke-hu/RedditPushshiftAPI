Up at night having problems breathing.....

Why did I go back to smoking! I was up all night having problems breathing because I felt my throat tightening. I am using a CPAP Machine due to Sleep Apnea, so Sleep Apnea is a condition I have anyway. But I absolutely know that smoking is not helping this situation. Why did I go back? I have to want to quit! I have to quit! 

My partner is part of a smoking cessation program. However, my partner does not know I went back. Lots of showers.  I should call the state quit hotline.

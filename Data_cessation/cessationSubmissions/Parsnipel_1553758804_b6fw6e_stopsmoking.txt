Smoking joints and relapsing

I quit smoking January first of last year after 8 years. In the meantime I think I smoked 2 or 3 whole cigarettes and a drag here or there.

I have recently moved to another city and my best friend lives here. Unfortunately he smokes. We used to smoke together, like, have a chill night together and just share a pack of smokes until it's gone.

Ever since I went traveling I smoked less and less weed. My tolerance was so low that a small drag would make me trip balls, so I refrained from it, save for some nights on my own with sci-fi thrillers.

Now that I've smoked weed some more I can smoke again and enjoy it more, even in company of non-smokers. I also drink less, but I've substituted it with weed I guess.

I have this non-tobacco smoking mixture (Hazel leaf, Papaya, Mint &amp; Eucalyptus). It's allright and I can smoke weed at home without ingesting any nicotine. However, when I'm out with friends they don't like this mixture. They prefer tobacco because they're used to it. At first I didn't mind at all, because I got high so fast, 2 drags of weed/tobacco mixture isn't going to get me hooked on cigarettes.

Now that I'm smoking more and more often, I can imagine myself getting hooked on tobacco/cigarettes again. Especially at parties or when I'm hanging out with smokers I have the urge to take a drag. It's not even satisfying a need, like back in the old days, because I'm no longer addicted. I just enjoy the taste and the act of consuming something through my lungs.

Does anyone have any experience with this? I think maybe I should just quit smoking all tobacco and only smoke my own non-tobacco joints...

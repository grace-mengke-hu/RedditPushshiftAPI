Just wanted to stop by and check in.

On day 5 (of cigs) and I had very strong cravings for a cig and booze last night, but I dodged the bullet. I had to stop on the way home and get iced tea. I really thought if I stopped at the local wawa I would get cigs so I popped a piece of nicorette gum and drove to the local wegmans and got iced tea there since they don't sell cigs. I also drove a different way home to avoid driving by the liquor store. I dodged the bullet, went to an AA meeting and got over the urges. So happy for these small successes. So glad I woke up sober and smoke free to enjoy this rainy morning. Stay strong guys.

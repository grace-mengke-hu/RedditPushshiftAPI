How many lighters did I ever think I need?

So since stopping smoking 31 days ago, I have been finding lighters all over the place. I just did put on a hoodie that I haven't worn in a bit and out of the front pocket as I put on the hoodie was a lighter. I counted the lighters that I have collected so far and I have 17. 

All the apps that are out there tell us how much money we have saved on cigarettes. I would like for one of them to tell how much we have saved not buying lighters lol

Heading to bed, won't stink it up for the wife.

Well, actually I may still do that (dutch oven and all) but at least not with smoke!  The good news is it's going to be 8-9 hrs of craving free time.  And I'll wake up with about 19 hrs under my belt.

Glad to be back on the forum.  This time I won't leave.

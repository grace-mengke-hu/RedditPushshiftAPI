5 days off and back on

I'm not annoyed at myself this time, I figure everyone has their own way of quitting this obnoxious addiction. 

I'm finding it interesting each time I stop n start, i gain more insight and paradoxically more driven to stop permanently.

It's almost like the more I keep stopping and starting the more I find I'm loosing any illusion to keep doing it, also the longer each period of non smoking has been.

1 day, to 3 days, to 5 days.

I'm on my way to permanently being a non smoker.

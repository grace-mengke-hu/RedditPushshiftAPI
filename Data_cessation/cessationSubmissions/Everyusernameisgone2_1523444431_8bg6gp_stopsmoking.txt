Advice for increasing aerobic capacity/healing of lungs quickly?

Hey quit fam,

Iâ€™m 8.5 days in and have just started playing soccer for the first time since I was 17, which was 13 years ago, when I started smoking instead.

First game tonight and boy did I struggle breathing. 3 hours later and my lungs are on fire and I am coughing a lot. 

I want to improve quickly and will do whatever it takes. Does anyone have any advice to increase aerobic capacity faster and heal my lungs faster? Different exercises? Vitamins? Would an asthma inhaler help? 

Looking for any and all experiences! 

P.S if anyone needs extra motivation to stay quit, join a team sport! I cannot let my team down, I was so embarrassed tonight and will NOT be that bad ever again!

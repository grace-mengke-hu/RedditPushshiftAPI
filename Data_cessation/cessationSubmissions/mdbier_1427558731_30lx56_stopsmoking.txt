Better than EVER!

Two weeks ago I decided to quit. I have tried before over the years without any real success. This time I started with an app, Smoke Free Beta. That led me here and this place makes my decision feel real and permanent. Thank you for all your support! I barely crave and when I do it's so easy to make the right decision. Today we took the kids to the pool and after hours of play I barely need to catch my breath. I feel excellent! I'm back in the gym and getting I to running again. I have even inspired my gf to quit, or at least vape but it's a start! 

If you're smoking, I promise that quitting is the best thing you can do for you and your family. I promise that the hard part is shortlived and the good part is everlasting!

Do this! Not one more puff!

Today was excruciating argh!

I smoked a pack a day for 11 years and this is the longest quit I have had (1 month and 2 days woohoo!) I certainly do not want to return to being a smoker AT ALL but today has been excruciating for some reason. Overall this has been the easiest quit I have ever had but today I am feeling these nicotine cravings in my bones! It seems they are lasting 10 minutes at all a time. Is this normal after a month? This is almost as bad as the first 2 days. Any words of encouragement or advice would be great!

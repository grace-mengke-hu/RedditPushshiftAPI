Hello Friday night! What is going well with you?

I am cooking up some food and cleaning a little. I have a new way of thinking about cravings. We know that each time we move through a craving we weaken the receptors that have been triggered. Over time the links continue to break down. The cravings strength diminishes. The process can be trying at times. Understanding that our neurons are firing and our limbic system is yelling for an associated dopamine hit creates strong cravings helps me to keep moving. Rewiring the brain takes time and endurance to move through the cravings.
So I think, or write out, when I have cravings "my brain is healing now" could apply to body and other associated healing symptoms that are strong. We are healing! Through a lot of complex pieces of a very addictive substance and habits associated with it. Whew. Keep it up. Do something nice for yourselves! Peace and Blessings.

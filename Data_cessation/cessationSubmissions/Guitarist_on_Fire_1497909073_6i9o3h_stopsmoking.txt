first real attempt in years

Just found this sub, and with some recent life events I think I'm finally ready to give it a try. Tired of being shackled to an expensive habit that's killing me. It's only been a few hours but I think I have the determination I need to make this attempt stick. Maybe. Maybe not. But this can't go on forever. At least I have vaping to curb the nicotine issues.

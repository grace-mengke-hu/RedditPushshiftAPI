My humble 600 days after 28 years. I vaped for the first 60 and I still use lighters to light the BBQ.

You know how it is when you got everything BUT the lighter :) 

Seriously, the vape did it for me. I was addicted to the act of smoking just as much as the nicotine. When you hear e-cig or vape, I think many connect that with nicotine and that is not the whole picture. I switched my vaped to 0nic after only 30 days. After that, I was feeding the physical hand to mouth addiction. I was able to stop that after another 30 days. I still get a strong trigger craving once in a while but the force is strong with me and I laugh it off.

The vape was a means to an end. A tool. I knew I would have problems quitting without it. 

Good luck to all of you starting out this year. Stay strong. This sub and the people on it are incredibly helpful. 

Thanks everyone for all your help.

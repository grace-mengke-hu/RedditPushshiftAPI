Approaching my 100th day...

...and realised I've not thought about a cigarette for about 2 weeks now - there was a big craving hurdle before that but now it's gone

However I'm getting some mouth ulcers, I had a look online and apparently stopping smoking can cause that, has anyone had a similar experience?

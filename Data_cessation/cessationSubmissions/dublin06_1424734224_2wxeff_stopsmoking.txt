The reason I failed so many times : The absurd notion of the 'Victory Smoke'

We've all been there. Days, weeks, months gone without a smoke and then suddenly we're back on a pack or two a day. I've always blamed it on the party that night, or the odd binge drinking session. I just realized, in my case at least, put simply all these were me thinking 'Wow, we've done it. It's time to celebrate!'

I shall never understand how I came to associate this 'celebration' with what is, in reality, the act of poisoning myself. I can distinctly remember at least three occasions where I've fallen back into the trap with a Victory Smoke to celebrate the start of a trip to somewhere nice. What an idiot I must have been to even think that inhaling a lungful of smoke would in any way enhance the actual high from the spectacular views or the smell/taste of a new cuisine. Finishing exams in spite of all the tiredness, burning eyes, anxiety brought about by the cigarette, then celebrating it with of course, another cigarette.  The successful project completion cigarette is the one that haunts me the most. Thinking back to those days, I'm sure I would've been so much more productive if I wasn't all the time planning my next smoke break. Shit. That's so many months down the drain.

I've just finished reading EASYWAY and I've come to the realization that all these days, I've been letting the actual 'high' of a success/new experience be trodden upon by the act of lighting up.

When does one start associating a cigarette with the notion of treating oneself? Why does our rational mind not comprehend the absurdity of the notion?

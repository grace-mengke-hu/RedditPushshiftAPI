Any success switching from cigs to vape?

I tried the whole vaping thing when it first came out. I honestly felt like I started smoking more because places where I couldn't smoke (like my house), I would just vape. So I stopped vaping and just went back to smoking cigarettes. 

Now I'm going through another unsuccessful attempt to cease smoking, however I just recently happened to find one of my old vapes in my underwear drawer. So now the question that I must ask is...

Has anyone truly had a success story where you started vaping so you could quit smoking cigarettes? 

A few years ago is when I started vaping, so it was still fairly new. The sales associates always claimed that they knew all these success stories where someone they knew successfully quit smoking cigarettes after they switched to vaping. The sales rep would always push me to buy the 24mg nicotine oils and then go down to the 18mg, then to the 12mg, etc until eventually I would just be smoking oil with no nicotine. Is this bullshit or does it really work? 

I will totally be willing to give vaping another go if it works! Or if anybody else has any other suggestions please help ! I've been smoking maybe about a half pack of menthols a day, and I just really want to get healthy again. 

I'm on Wellbutrin XL and my Dr said it should help with the cravings... 

Speaking of cravings... I recently just stopped doing heroin about 9 months ago, and I will honestly admit that I am having such a harder time kicking this nicotine addiction than I ever did with kicking opiates. 

So please, help. ?

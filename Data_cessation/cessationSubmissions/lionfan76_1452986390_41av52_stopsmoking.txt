100 Days!

     Wow, triple digits.
  The best part to me isn't smelling better, saving money, feeling healthier etc., it's the freedom! For twenty-five years I was a slave to some dried plant matter wrapped in paper. It dictated every decision of my life, if I wasn't going to be able to smoke, then I'm out.
   Now I'm free.  I can take that long car ride. I can enjoy my kid's school functions(kind of). I can watch that three hour movie, and actually enjoy the last half of it.
   I'm so excited for the rest of my life being wide open. That is what keeps me going when my addict brain whispers the temptations. I've broken the shackles of my slavery, why would I want to try them on again just to see what it's like? That would be madness.
   Thanks to all on this sub for the support and encouragement. May this find you free and enjoying life. Never put the chains back on!

16 M, ready to make a change

I started vaping about a month or two back, and I really liked it. But I knew there were a couple problems after two weeks.

I noticed slight and occasional pains in my lungs, which I really didn't like. I also realized that I was using it an insane amount every day, since there was no odor or lingering smoke, and thus was easy to hide from my parents, as well as super convenient.

I really want the device back (I tossed it), but I also really want to quit, not because of health problems or cost, but because I know I'm hurting my parents and my girlfriend (I lied about having one). Plus, religious reasons. Honor thy father and mother.

So, the goal here is to keep from smoking until I turn eighteen, at which point I'll probably buy a hookah, as I've wanted one. I hope you guys here can help me. Any tips to keep from thinking about it?

Having a hard time quitting

Hey guys just realized this subreddit was a thing not more than 5 minutes ago and felt like this is the place I need to be. I've been having a lot of difficulty quitting smoking/vaping, I started when I was about 15 and I am 21 currently but I just want to live a healthier life. I recently tried to quit vaping and ended up just buying a pack so that didn't work out very well. Anyways I just feel like the last cig I smoked an hour or so ago just made me feel so down and I really just don't want to do it anymore. Hope you guys have some tips or anything that might help I know the first few days are hard, also I'm doing this cold turkey because the gum just ends me up in the same place. 

Thank you

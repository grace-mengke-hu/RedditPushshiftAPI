Day 5 - Struggling at work!

Hi guys. I'm on day 5, the longest I've ever gone but I am using an aid (e-cig with lowest nicotine). I find work really difficult, the canteen isn't nice so everyone hangs out at the smoking area and my colleagues offer me cigarettes even when I tell them I'm trying to quit! I want to still hang out with them but find it easier to resist their offers. Any suggestions other than just sitting in the canteen alone?!

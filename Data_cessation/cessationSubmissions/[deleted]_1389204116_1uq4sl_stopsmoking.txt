Day Three

I wanted to be a smoker before I smoked, I liked the smell and envied the act.  When people say "that good feeling you get when you smoke - non-smokers feel that way all the time" ... I want to believe that but I started smoking as a reason to get out of bed in the morning, and a way to take a break when I was stuck in anxious loops.  I find myself mourning for the times when I would really enjoy a cigarette, or really enjoy chain smoking (while reading, while riding a bike, while drinking, while doing homework, while at my summer home with my family, on the beach, in the early morning watching the sun rise, talking to strangers, etc etc).

I'm trying not to think about those kinds of things, I'm trying to focus on the cough I have, and the dizziness after a cigarette.  I'm trying to think about quitting smoking as a way to explore a challenge for greater challenges in my life (I'm working towards overcoming other addictions that are more difficult than nicotine) but it is real fucking hard.

I'm on day three,  I have headaches, difficulty sleeping, etc etc.  Surprisingly the times I used to smoke are not when its hard, but the times I couldn't smoke anyway (in class, support groups, when I'm trying to sleep).  Every time I look at my quit smoking app I'm shocked at how few days it's been.

Vape thing. 3 days no smoking.

Using 6mg vape pen. Heavy smoker up to 30 a day. It's really helped. It's hard. Very hard. But I'm doing it. I know I'm cheating but 3 days for me after smoking like a freight train is great. My wife is happy and so is my soon to be born son. Just wanted to say something about it.

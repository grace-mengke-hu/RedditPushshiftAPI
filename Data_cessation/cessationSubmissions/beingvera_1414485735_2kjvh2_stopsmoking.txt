I want to quit but..

Hi all. I've taken the first step by realising that I *[24 F]* need to cut this crappy habit. I don't smoke more than 2-3 a day, but it still makes me feel horrible.
My question here is how to avoid the nasty mood swings that accompany quitting? Can withdrawal be avoided? What about *those* days of the month?
Thank you!

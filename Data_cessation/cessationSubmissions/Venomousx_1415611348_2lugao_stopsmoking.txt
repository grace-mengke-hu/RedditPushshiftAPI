Advice on how to help my mom quit? She has a lot of stress and a strong psychological addiction to smoking. (She's 62, and has been smoking for 30+ years)

The biggest issue is that she has a lot of stress and has a hard time dealing with it. Every time she has gone back to smoking in the past has been because of this reason. It doesn't help that our family/household (My, my mom, and my boyfriend) are really struggling financially, and we're all dealing with depression. It certainly makes getting and staying motivated that much harder (The "smoking kills" argument does not influence her in the slightest. "I don't want to live forever. At least I could die happy" are some of the things she's said)

I was wondering if anyone had any advice on how to deal with the day-to-day stress of life driving my mom to go back to smoking? How to help her calm down when she feels herself getting riled up about something? And also how to deal with the anger and irritability that comes when she tries to quit?

Another issue is where she works. She works at a gas station where cigarettes are literally at arm's length. There's also co-workers and customers walking by constantly with the smell of smoke on them. This definitely makes it harder for her to resist. But we need the money and she can't find work anywhere else, so any suggestions on how to deal with these temptations would also be appreciated.

Anyway, I know that she would like to quit, and has tried a few times before. The fact that she has failed in the past makes her scared to try again (she's said things like "I don't have a lot of faith in myself") she has mentioned that she thinks a support group might help ("I wish there was a smokers anonymous, like AA" etc) unfortunately we live way out in a rural area so such groups are few and far between.

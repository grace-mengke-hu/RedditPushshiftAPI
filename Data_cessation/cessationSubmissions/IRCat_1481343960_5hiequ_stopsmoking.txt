I don't think I really WANT to quit, have you experienced this?

I'm on night 3, coming up on day 4 of no cigarettes. I have been using nicotine patches and a vape though so technically not gotten rid of nicotine. But I've found that even with the nicotine replacement, I just want a fucking cigarette man.. I unintentionally quit smoking and I just don't think it's my time and don't think it ever will be. I always told myself I would only ever quit when I got pregnant and had a child. (which I'm not even sure if I'll ever do) Not sure why I've lasted 4 days already without buying a pack, not even sure why I'm posting here. Maybe part of me wants to quit but I think it's for the wrong reasons. My boyfriend does not smoke and he is happy I've gone without for a few days, and my parents would be thrilled if they knew I quit, but I haven't told them as I know I probably wouldn't follow through. 

Did anyone else feel like they didn't even care for quitting? I wouldn't mind smoking for the rest of my life, I really wouldn't, and I want to know if others who have quit for long periods felt this way too before I go out and buy a pack and disappoint.

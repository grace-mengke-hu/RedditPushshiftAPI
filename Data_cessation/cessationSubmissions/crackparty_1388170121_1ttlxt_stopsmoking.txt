Day 18. Extremely sore throat.

I am a 23 year old male. I smoked cigarettes for the past 5 years.. I was never a chain smoker (I would smoke 2-3 during the week and tended to overindulge on weekends, sometimes smoking half a pack or more). 
The first week was a breeze. The cravings were manageable and I noticed no side effects. 
From day 9-14, I had an awful headache
As soon as the headache ceased (14-present), I noticed overall pressure in my head/sinuses.

15-present, I have been suffering from a horribly sore throat. Very painful to swallow. I would love to know if any of you suffered similar symptoms and what tips you all have. I am in need of some relief!

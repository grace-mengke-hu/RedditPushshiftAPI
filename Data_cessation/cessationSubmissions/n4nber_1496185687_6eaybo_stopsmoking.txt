Just smoked last cigarette from a pack and don't want to smoke anymore. Here's what I want to do now.

I'm 24, smoking for over 6 years. For the last 2 or 3 years I have smoked a pack (20) daily.

I have just smoked last cigarette from a pack and don't want to smoke anymore.

I have read a lot about smoking, habits, routines and other smoking-related stuff for years now. I have an urge to quit for a long time now, tried it few times, most of them were completely unsuccessful, but there were 2 times I haven't smoked for two weeks and a month.

As many of you should know, smoking addiction is both physical and chemical. I have prepared a plan to fight both those aspects simultaneously.

**Physical addiction**

If any of you have read "The Power of Habit" by Charles Duhigg, you might know how hard it is to change your habits and daily routines. All of us have triggers that make us do things subconciously, and physical addiction to smokes is one of them.

The easiest (even though it is not easy at all) way of getting rid of bad habit is replacing it with another one. While I'm a smoker, I have also a bad habit of not drinking enough water. I want to replace a physical urge to smoke (a habit of smoking) with habit of drinking water.

Every day I smoke 20 cigarettes. Recommended amount of water to drink daily is about 2 liters, so for each cigarette there is 100 ml of water. It's approximately half a glass of water. Each time I want to smoke I will take half glass of water and drink it slowly, to match the time of smoking (around 5 minutes).

There are also other smoking-related habits that have to be replaced. For example, every day when I'm going to my workplace, I stop by a local shop and buy a pack of cigs. I will keep on coming to this shop, but instead of cigarettes, I would buy a bottle of water.

**Chemical addiction**

As for the chemical addiction, I don't want to do anything. I think the best way is to let the chemical addiction wear off naturally.

But, as I'm precautious, I have bought pills with citisine, which tricks organism into thinking it got nicotine.

I think about it more as a backup plan in case I can't get water for various reasons (can't find any to be honest) or when lack of smoke will make me unable to focus on things.

**What's next?**

I know it's not much, but maybe it will encourage some of you to stop smoking and give you some ideas how to do it.

I will keep you updated on my progress. Hope it will work!

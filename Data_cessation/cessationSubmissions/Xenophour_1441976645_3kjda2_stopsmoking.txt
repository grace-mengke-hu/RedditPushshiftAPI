6 months!? All thanks to YOU guys!

I cannot believe I'm saying this. I'm 6 months free of smoking. Thank you so much for the continued support and helping me through my hard times.

To anyone still quitting, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE hang in there! It WILL get better, the cravings GO AWAY after a few months, be strong! The feeling that you're in charge is AMAZING!!

Started smoking after 1.5 years of quitting. Quit again, it has been 7 days!

This time i hated myself for smoking. I quit the first time using easyway but knowing all that and starting again made me hate myself. My social performance really suffered because of it, and my self esteem. I didn't gave any rat's ass about anything before but this was different almost... Can't really put it into words. 


Anyway I made the final decision and I will in no circumstances take even a whiff of nicotine into my body. 

This brings me to my question, if anything like that happens again (which I'm sure won't, but just to be sure) what should I do?

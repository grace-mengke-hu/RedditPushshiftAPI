Round two fight!

Hey pals! My names Randy, I'm a stupid fuck. Let me explain.... I've been smoking this time for about four to five months. Before this, I quit for almost a year & a half. Had all the harder parts over with done, then I moved in with two friend that both smoked & it was my downfall. 

I had to watch my mother fight cancer. She's in remession now, by the grace of what ever, she made it through and she's a cancer survivor. Typing that out is making tears pour down my face, I should know better than anyone what this shit can do to a person. Yet what did I do, pick it right back up & kept smoking, because like I said before I'm a stupid fuck. But not ignorant. I'm done, As of today I simply refuse to ever put another cigarettes to my face again. I can do this, I've done this before and I'm just done. 

Plus smart people simply don't smoke. That's one thing my brother told me & it really just clicked. What intelligent person would cause themselves so much harm? 

Have a nice day, Reading all of your post really helped me to get my shit together and I really owe this place so much. I truly belive one day smoking will be a thing of the past, as it should be. Good fucking riddance.

Day 3 - Starting Over

Hello everyone, 

I am starting up again and trying to find a way to make this my last time. I sat and thought a lot over the last week as I built up to the decision to not grab another pack or another nicotine replacement. It was a sense of "here we go again" that left me feeling a sense of shame and defeat all at once. I just couldn't believe how much I have tried and failed at this. 

Then I tried to just think about what had worked in the past, and what left me feeling like "I got this". It was the sense of accomplishment, not from removing smoking but from reclaiming the space where smoking dominates my life. This will be my focus once again. 

I know the next few days will be hard and I will just focus on getting through it. However, as I feel my energy come back I want to ask what I will do with the time I am getting back and how I will build something that I don't want to lose to smoking. 

Thanks everyone and today I will not smoke with you

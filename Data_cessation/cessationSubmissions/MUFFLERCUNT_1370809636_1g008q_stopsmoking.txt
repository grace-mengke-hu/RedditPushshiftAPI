Its been 3 months...

Everyday i want it every single damn day. its a little voice in my head that says dip. you know what would be great right now? smacking that can and throwing one in. I went through around 25 cans and quit because girls dont like it and my parents wouldn't be very happy. But i expected the want to last 2 weeks but no it doesn't i cant stand this. I almost went and picked up another can today. Is this want evr going to end? Im 17 and dont want this to be a life long habit.

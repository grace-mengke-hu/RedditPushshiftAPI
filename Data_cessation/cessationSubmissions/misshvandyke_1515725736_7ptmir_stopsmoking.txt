10 days and DAMN this feels good.

10th day not smoking today! WHO AM I 😃🙏 12 years of smoking and I had began to hate myself for it. 

Smoking had intertwined itself into every aspect of my life. Everything. The day to day revolved around that next lightup and first inhale. Even the things that are positive for me and I adore - my creative practice, post working out, being out in nature and reaching the summit of a mountain - all came under the grasp of cigarettes. Seriously - if that isn't maddening... 

Sneaky sneaky cigarettes, stealing my quality of life and Freedom of Choice away from me. Stealing my identity from me. The first few days were me desperately trying to remember who I was before smoking. How I operated on a day to day basis without the constant pull outside to fill my lungs with smoke only to go back inside feeling weak, depleted of energy, shameful and.... used. Even when I tried to run away, cigarettes chased me. I can't anymore. I turn 30 in a few months. Knowing I am reclaiming my power with the dawn of this new chapter of my life brings me tears of happiness. I feel free and unchained for the first time in seemingly forever.

Thank you, everyone. This subreddit inspires me, motivates me to keep going, supplies me with phenomenal tips and tricks, and tells me I'm not alone. We are in this together. Thank you!! You all rock.

Not one more puff, no matter WHAT.

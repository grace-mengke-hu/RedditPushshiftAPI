spontaneously quit today!

So I think I'm finally fed up with poisoning myself. When I hit 10 years as a smoker I couldn't believe it. I was a pack a day smoker when I was younger, but now average a pack a week or so.  I just always thought I'd have given it up by then. I turn 29 in a month and remember wanting and trying to quit for my 26th. 

I've tried cold turkey, I've even made it a six month stretch or so, hell even to go on a family vacation for a week I can not smoke bc I just don't allow myself to. I've vaped but always break them or can't make time to pick up the supplies. Yet I make time to stop for cigarettes. I'm finally just disgusted with it, disgusted with enjoying it even and worrying about missing it. 

I bought the patch on my lunch break yesterday (Monday is made it til 9pm before having one), but sorta panicked a little at home and ended up smoking a few cigs. I figure I have to try everything to quit right? And I think the mental routine part of it is huge for me. 

So today on my lunch break I came home to walk the dogs, and kind of wanted a smoke while I walked them or to do "one last cig" but I fought the urge, picked up a patch and took it back with me to work and slapped it on. I broke my Wednesday routine of going home, and drove down to ride my horse. 

I'm feeling okay so far but am nervous! For me it's usually day three or four that are the worst. I want this to be the last time I quit. I read some other posts about using the patch and hope that this works for me! If anyone has a happy patch story I'd love to hear it.

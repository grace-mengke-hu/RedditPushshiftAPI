One cigarette can hurt

I'm giving up and am currently Day 9 smokefree.

But I gave up before, 3 years ago. I got to about Day 200 before I stopped counting (even 4 months in I'd get an occasional craving).
I reached over 1.5 years before I thought "I'm totally over this, I've just finished uni, it won't hurt" and had a cigarette.

 A few weeks later I was back to where I was before I gave up. 

The cigarette wasn't even enjoyable in truth. But, it reactivated all the sensors in my brain and suddenly I had cravings again. Worse though, I had no motivation to stop myself, so I gave in.

I guess what I'm trying to say is one cigarette really can hurt.

So here I am, in 2014, trying again...I won't make the same mistake again.

Day 9 smokefree.

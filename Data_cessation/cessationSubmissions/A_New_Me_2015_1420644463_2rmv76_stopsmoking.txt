Pretty much over it now...

So I haven't lit up since 12/15 - I'm feeling great, I'm no longer craving for a smoke, and I don't even want a cigarette. I used to say "I don't need a cigarette" but now, it's "don't want".

I'm proud of myself. Last night, I was pretty upset and I realized this morning, not once did I think I needed a cigarette. And I only realized this because I see posts from /r/stopsmoking and my quitting apps are reminding me.

This is awesome.

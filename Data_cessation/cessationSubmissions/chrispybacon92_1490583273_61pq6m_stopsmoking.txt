Anybody else in Cali quitting April 1st?

I know it's a good thing this law passed. But I refuse to pay over $9 a pack of smokes. Like I said it's gunna be great for me and I'm gunna save money... but damnit I'm going through some shit right now and I gotta quit smoking on top of it. I really hope I don't kick someone's teeth in that even just looks at me wrong. Obviously I'm kidding (kinda) but you folks have any tips for me not to lose my shit and snap next month?

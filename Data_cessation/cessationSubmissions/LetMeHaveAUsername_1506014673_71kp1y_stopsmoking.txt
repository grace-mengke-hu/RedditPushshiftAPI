How long should I expect it to take before I can function.

A couple of month ago I figured I'd give quitting a try. So I decided to just not smoke starting when I got up, on a regular work day, with nothing but some nicotine gum to help me through.

Within a couple of hours it hit me harder and differently than I expected. I though it'd get my emotions, but it was really my general consciousness. I'm pretty sure I experienced the room as darker than it actually was, couldn't think straight, had a hard time holding a conversation like normal, and felt not a million miles from fainting. The gum - which was great for helping me through a long flight - didn't seem to help at all.

So I grabbed my emergency pack and started up, because I couldn't do my job, mostly. Only difference being that I switched to light when I bought a new pack on my way home.

Anyway, it's kinda time to make a proper go of it soon. Current plan, given the previous experience is to take some days off for a long weekend so I can lie or run or crawl around  - whatever needed - without responsibilities. But if I'm going to do this, I want to definitely make it through, so I'm wondering how long I'd need before I get back to work. I'm at about a pack a day (of lights) now. I'd really prefer to quit cold turkey, because anything else just seems like prolonged torture.

**tl;dr** Quitting for a few hours (+ ~7 hours of sleep) made me completely unable to function. How long should I expect that to last quitting suddenly from 1 pack a day?

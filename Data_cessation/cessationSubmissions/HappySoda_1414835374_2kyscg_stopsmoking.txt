Last night sucked!

I am in Vienna, Austria for the weekend, arrived yesterday. Of course, I went out to see the city and enjoy the nightlife. 

The city is beautiful, brimming with life. I really like the food here, too. But I immediately noticed a big problem: indoor smoking is still allowed here and fully embraced. 

For the entire night, I was engulfed in smoke. My wife asked me if it bothers me and makes me want to smoke. I responded that I was chocking to death over there. We ended the night early, because I felt like I was going to throw up. 

I can't believe everywhere used to be like this. It's even harder to believe that I enjoyed smoking merely two months ago. And yet, here I am: getting sick from cigarette smoke. Oh yeah, today is my two-month date! 

BTW, my pool game is better than ever now! It's amazing how well one can concentrate when not having to think about going for a smoke every game :)

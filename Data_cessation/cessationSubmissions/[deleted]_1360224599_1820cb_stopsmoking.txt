I'm 20 years old and I smoke a pack a day at college. I NEED TO QUIT. What way did you guys find success in? 

I'm posting this as I smoke hopefully my last cigarette ever. I started smoking a year ago to this day and I'm up to over a pack a day. Both my parents have been smoking since they were 15 and I promised myself I would never touch one. I transferred to the University of Illinois last year as a Junior and went through some problems and picked up smoking to ease through my stress. Since then I have had bronchitis 5 times in the past 6 months (because I smoke so heavily, my body can't beat it 100%) and have attracted a condition called pericarditis which is like having mini heart attacks. This is again caused by me smoking too much. I like to think of myself as healthy. I play in basketball and softball leagues on campus and workout daily. No matter what I try I just can't quit. I have a smoker's cough, I am destroying my body, my clothes smell, my parents are disappointed, and I am wasting close to 10$ a day. I found this sub-reddit and I see the motivation and support you guys give to others. I would do anything to be successful, and with your help, I know I can. Thanks for listening.

Cough after quitting?

I started getting sick Oct 31st and that helped me quit. Shortly after quitting though I felt fine, but I have a nasty cough. It's mostly dry. I do cough up mucus in the mornings.

The plus side is this cough has helped me not want to smoke AT ALL. I have zero cravings. Even when I'm out drinking and see them, smell them, etc - it's just gross to me now.

Has anyone else had this happen to them? I feel like my lungs are punishing me for punishing them for so many years.

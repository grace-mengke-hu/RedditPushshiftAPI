90 Days! A message to the newly quit and lurkers inside.

So I remember when I was first setting out on this journey.  I would read posts of people 3 months in, 6 months in, and longer saying that they still thought about cigs from time to time.  This was very disheartening and scary.  It fed my fear that I will always be "fighting" something.

What I failed to realize, is that when they say they thought about cigs it was NOTHING like what we are going through in the first few weeks.  It is so fucking easy now, when the thought of cigarettes are triggered by something it is quickly replaced with an overwhelming feeling of pride and accomplishment.  A realization that I'm not a slave to it any longer.  They really aren't urges any longer, more just a recognition that this was a time that I used to associate with smoking.  I just had one this morning as I was walking by the spot I would always stop for a cig on the way up to my office.  It put a huge smile on my face and I practically skipped down the hall to get to my PC to post this message.

It really is so easy.  After the first few weeks (3-4) there is nothing difficult about being a non-smoker.  In fact it's easier than being a smoker, WAY easier.

Congratulations to everyone on this sub, and a BIG thank you to everyone on this sub.  I was a 20 year smoker and I have finally made it to the light at the end of that tunnel.  I used to glimpse the light from time to time, but now I'm there and I owe a big part of that to everyone here <3

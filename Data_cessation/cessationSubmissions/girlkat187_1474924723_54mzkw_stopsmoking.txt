How can your spouse support you in quitting or inspire you to quit?

I am the spouse of a long-time smoker. I love him unconditionally and that will never change, but I also hate smoking with the fury of a thousand hell-fires. I’m not completely new to the topic of addiction: I know that a person has to want to quit and that they have to arrive at that themselves. I know that nagging only promotes addiction and I do my best to never use it. I want to love and support him and be a source of complete positivity in his life. 
So I’m here asking for advice. Accepting the fact that I can’t change him and that the motivation must come from within, is there anything at all that your spouse did/said/could have done that made you/would have made you want to quit smoking? Did your spouse have a positive role in your decision to quit, and your journey in quitting, and if so, what was that role?

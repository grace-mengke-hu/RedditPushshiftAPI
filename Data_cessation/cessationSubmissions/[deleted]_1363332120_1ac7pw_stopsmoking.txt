Advice - My Quitting Smoking Plan

I've been smoking for 5 years, ~10 per day. I had a breakup a couple months ago and in my self-reflection I've decided to finally kick the habit. 25 years old, soon to be 26.

I'm going overseas in two weeks to visit my family in Europe. The day of the flight (morning flight) I won't smoke, my last will be the night before. I'll be in-transit for 22 hours or so, and when I land it will be my birthday and I'll turn 26. I think this vacation is a good time because I'll be going crazy from not smoking and it'll be easier to cope when I'm not at work.

I'll be in the country-side for northern europe for 1.5 weeks, mostly with my grandparents. I usually smoke a lot when I visit them.

**What can I do when stress-moments happen and I need to do something instead of smoking? Everyone in Europe smokes, this is an issue.

**I still think about the ex-gf (getting over it tho) and sometimes look at her posts online. I've defriended from everything but some stuff still is public, any advice if I accidentally find myself creeping on her social media? I think this is the biggest hurdle, I end up torturing myself and smoke a lot when I do this. Obviously best advice is to not do it.

**I want to totally quit nicotine dependency and don't want to use nicorette gum or lozenges - which I've used before. Any thoughts on this? Is it worth it to not use them so your body doesn't get nicotine?

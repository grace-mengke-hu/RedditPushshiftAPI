2015 was a good year

I haven't been here for a while. After about 6 months smoking started to seem irrelevant and I didn't feel the need for the motivation or encouragement that this sub is so good at. 

When I quit I assumed that life as a non smoker would feel like missing out and that I'd have to be constantly fighting not to smoke. For the first three months it was like that but by month six it was more or less over and it doesn't feel like that now. I rarely give cigarettes a second thought these days. 

If you're gearing up for a quit attempt in 2016 do it. It was the best thing I did in 2015.

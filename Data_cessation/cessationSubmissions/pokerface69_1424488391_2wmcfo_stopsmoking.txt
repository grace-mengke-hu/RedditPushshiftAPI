25 days it's getting better :)

I don't feel any physical symptoms now. all I've to do is fight them urges sometimes. 
last night we had a little get together in my apartment. my friends were smoking in my room in front of me. it triggered some cravings but they were very weak since I already knew Abt them in advance maybe. 

it's going good :) thanks guys :)
join me in not smoking today.

I made it 8 hours...

Then I caved and bought a pack because I was bored at work. I'm so angry at myself that I couldn't even make it a whole day without a smoke. Hoping that the weekend will be better, at least I can do things to distract myself and keep my hands busy with knitting or crochet. But at work I can't sit with my yarn and zone out. So frustrating...

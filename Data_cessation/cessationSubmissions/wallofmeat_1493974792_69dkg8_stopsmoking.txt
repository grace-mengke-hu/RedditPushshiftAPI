DAY 1 : 27 (M) UK (just under a pack a day since age 15). Using NHS Stop Smoking Service.

Hello There!

I stumbled upon some mortality statistics a few weeks ago on reddit and it highlighted the health risks of smoking to me - especially if I continued into my 30s. I also recently got engaged and don't want to take smoking with me into the future. 

I'm using the NHS's free stop smoking service and have so far been to a couple of sessions which have been good for focusing myself into a process and getting advice / encouragement / nicotine replacement (some free / some discounted). 

Anyway - cravings arnt so bad yet. I am optimistic about getting through my 3 day hump this weekend. I'm a slightly anxious person sometimes and I'm hoping a stressful situation dosnt de-rail me. 

Anyway we'll see how it goes. Hopefully many more posts after this one.

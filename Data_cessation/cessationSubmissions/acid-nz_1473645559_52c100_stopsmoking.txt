First day today!

I'm having a Gastric Sleeve in a few months, so of course I had to give up smoking.

Im surprised though, no cravings or crankiness. Also I haven't had cigarettes on my mind either.

All other times I've tried to quit i've had mad as cravings, but nothing this round. Perhaps because i've accepted that I'm quitting for real this time.

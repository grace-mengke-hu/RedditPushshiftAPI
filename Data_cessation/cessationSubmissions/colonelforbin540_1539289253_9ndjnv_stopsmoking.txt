Nicorette heartburn

Got through my first 36 hours without a cigarette in 12 years. This last week I've had a tightness in my chest that comes and goes. I wanted to see what would happen if I stopped and after a grueling day and a half, the feeling seems to be gone. I started this as a break but I'm ready to go all in.

I've been taking nicorette gum and it's defiantly helping, but I get heartburn after every piece. I don't want to try the patch because I just want to curve cravings rather than have a constant stream enter my body. Open to vaping but I really want to stop putting anything in my lungs.

Anyone else have this problem? Any alternatives that did the trick?

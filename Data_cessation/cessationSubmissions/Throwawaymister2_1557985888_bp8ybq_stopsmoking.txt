I did it.

Quitting smoking is easy, I’ve done it dozens of times. 

But seriously now folks, this is how I finally kicked it, with a little bit of help from the flu. 

I switched from cigarettes to a Juul while I was sick and coughing and smoking was just not enjoyable. 

I stuck with the e-cig for just over a year, slowly tapering down the oil percentages, then I got the flu for nearly a month, and didn’t smoke the Juul at all. I’m now 4 months nicotine free and 16 months or so cigarette free. 

You can do it. Just get the flu.

54 days...

and i don't have cravings anymore. it's kinda weird considering how tough i thought it would be. i smoked for 13 years and once quit for 8 months before college and started again in college because my friends were smokers and i wanted to look cool (how stupid now that i think about it). but that was years ago and i don'r remember how i did it. once i quit for 2 weeks because i has septoplasty, but i couldn't resist the cravings.

now it's been 54 days and i don't remember the last time i had a craving. maybe around day 20 or something. anyway, not complaining about it, it's great. just wanting to share

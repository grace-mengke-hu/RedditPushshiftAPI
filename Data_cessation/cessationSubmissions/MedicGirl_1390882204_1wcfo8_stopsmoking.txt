Want to get ready for the "Big Quit".

So, I've been a smoker since I was 18 (I'm 27 now). I've never really been an X pack of day smoker; I like to smoke while drinking and other than that, I'll go through a pack in about a week.

I have the hardest time staying smoke free. Longest I went was 18 months, then I started back up about six months ago. I have between 2-4 cigarettes a night, more if I'm in a smoke friendly environment. I'm ready to be smoke free permanently. I'd love to be able to go into a casino, bar, or the volunteer fire department and not feel the crushing desire to smoke. 

I've tried the Patches and Lozenges. Neither worked at all; they made me jittery and I had worse insomnia than I normally have. I was on Wellbutrin and that helped me quit, but the side effects made it unreasonable to finish the entire course.

My Reason to Quit: Yesterday was the first time I ever got winded doing my daily run. I've also been experiencing intermittent chest pain; I've been to my Cardiologist and have been given a "clean" bill of health, but I do have a minor heart condition that can be made worse due to smoking and it looks as if it's being exascerbated by smoking. I don't want to die when I'm 40.

My quit day is my birthday, February 2nd. Can a girl get some advice to help quit and stay quit from others who have been successful? Thank you. :)

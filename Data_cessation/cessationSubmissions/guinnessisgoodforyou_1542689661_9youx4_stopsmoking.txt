On my 5th day, still confident

Hi guys. I came across here after seeing a recent LPT. Thought it wound be good to say hello.


Like the title says, I'm going through my 5th day as a non smoker. It's been pretty tough but I'm still upbeat about it. On the second night we had after work drinks, it took every ounce of strength to resist smoking that night. I walked home pretty proud of myself. 



This attempt, I just feel... weird. Like my subconscious knows that I'm gonna really fight this time, and he's pulling out dirty tricks. Sometimes I'll be sitting and then for no reason suddenly get up, and start to walk towards the door, and I have to take control back and say no, I don't need to go outside and I don't want to either, thanks. 


Oh, and the dreams started already too. Earlier than on previous attempts. On night 3 and 4 (last night), and I obviously expect them to continue. I wake up either feeling guilty or not knowing what the hell is going on. Nothing I haven't been through but man does it play with your head. 


Gonna stay strong and beat this. Good luck to everyone on the same mission.

In need of guidance.

My latest quit has lasted 6 days.. Within those 6 days i have seen huge improvements physically.. I can smell, taste and breath again! I fully understand the risks of smoking and i'm loving the physical benefits from quitting.. BUT, i have been doing quite a bit of research into the cognitive benefits of nicotine (increase memory, concentration) etc. As i work in a professional role, i can not afford to 'lose my mind' so to speak.. Maybe it's just the addiction talking but i'm scared shitless that quitting smoking is going to cause a detrimental effect on my cognitive ability.. I have definitely noticed a lack in concentration and memory which i can attribute to the withdrawal of nicotine.. I am most worried that even if i do fully quit smoking, i will be at a disadvantage without the mental benefits of nicotine.. 

So i'm looking for some insight from those who have quit smoking and have seen a decrease in memory and basic brain function.. 

Thanks.

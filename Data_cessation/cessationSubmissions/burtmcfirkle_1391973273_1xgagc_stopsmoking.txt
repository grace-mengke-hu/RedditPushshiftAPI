Quit however you can and remember that it's infinitely easier to stay stopped than it is to quit!

I've tried other methods, including Carr's way. The best I could do after his book (which is a good book! It makes sense!) was 22 hours....now it's Chantix..again.

But that's okay. It works!  Here's to 24 hours without putting nicotine into in my body!

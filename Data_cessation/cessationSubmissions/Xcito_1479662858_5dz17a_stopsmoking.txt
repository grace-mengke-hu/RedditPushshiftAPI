Today is the first day

Smoked 1-2 packs a day for 15 years. Managed to quit 2013. Three years later I took ONE cigarette and now 6 months later I'm at 2 packs a day again. 

But enough is enough, smoked my last yesterday and today is my first nicotine free day. The cravings is high, but I'm not giving in! 

I will never smoke a cigarette again!!!

Update: That went well. I failed. Couldn't last a day :(

Update 2: after using champix for like 10 days now, I'm going to smoke the last cigarette soon. This time it feels much better.

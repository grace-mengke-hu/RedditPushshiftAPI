sup bruhs, just made it to day 5

I've smoked cigarettes 4 and half years now, and never really thought about ever quitting, but I quit weed(I was an addict) over a year ago, and I now think I'm ready.

Yesterday I was attending a party, got alot of beer, and was actually able to not smoke. But that has been the only fairly difficult situation so far, otherwise it has been quite easy actually. 

so.... yeah.. wish me good luck or somthing

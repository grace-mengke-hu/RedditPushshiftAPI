Mouth Ulcer

Hey folks!

I quit smoking about 10 days ago, and I've noticed I'm starting to develop small mouth ulcers now. I've read that some people do get them when they quit.

What is the best way to treat them? I'm guessing they can be treated like other mouth ulcers that are not related to smoking, but want to be sure.

Day 15 Been a rough ride but it seems to be getting better

A short explanation of my first 2 weeks smoke free in 3 years.

Of all the days so far day 8 was the worst just because i almost got into multiple accidents while at work. 

Everyday its been getting easier and easier and i have been feeling alot better each morning i wake up short of the long ass days i pull.

keep up the awesome work everyone and keep from smoking it gets easier just work it till you work it.

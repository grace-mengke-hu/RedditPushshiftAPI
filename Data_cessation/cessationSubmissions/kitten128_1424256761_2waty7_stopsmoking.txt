I can do this!

Day one. I sorta struggled getting out of bed knowing I wouldn't light up like is my usual morning ritual. Got up anyhow and went made a cup of coffee, did a little meditative breathing and just got on with my morning. Attitude totally turned around once I was awake. I will be popping in here a lot today, as I think reading and posting here will help. I hope I don't get annoying!

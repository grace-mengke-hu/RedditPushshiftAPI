Question for long term quitters who relapsed

I see a lot of posts where some people had quit for 3 months, 6 months, 2 years but relapsed.

Can you share your story as to why?

I'm curious because another common thing I see is that at that point people say that they don't have cravings but just a fleeting thought of cigarrettes.

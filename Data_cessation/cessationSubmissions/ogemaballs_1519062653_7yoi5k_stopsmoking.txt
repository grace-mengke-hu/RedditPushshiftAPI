I’m not motivated to quit

I’ve been thinking about quitting for what seems like 2 years now, but anytime I set a goal to quit, I quickly give myself excuses as to why I shouldn’t. 
It would really mean a lot to me if you all could flood me with reasons and advice to help convince me that I CAN and SHOULD quit smoking.

Every day starts with the same terrible feeling

I wake up every day and tell myself I need to quit today. 

I go into the day as quit and then comes a craving. Sometimes I give in sometimes I hold off till later In that day. Eventually there will be something that is "stressful" or "relaxful" that o need a smoke and just one won't hurt. The. It moves to I've already had one one more won't hurt. Of this happened in the morning by end of day I've gone by 10smokes of this is evening I've gone by 6smokes. 

Argh. I've done 2onths quit recently. I and really thought that was the final one. But I slipped and someone said I could relapse and I did. 

I want to quit but all the methods and ways I try seem to fail sooner than later. I've not tried the vape or the gum. As I feel that may grow to be its own problem soon enough. 

I think if I quit and  save money I can use that to buy the vape. 

I am not sure why I'm writing here, to be hopeful I guess. To not give up giving up. 
I need to do this.

Smoking on other drugs

I'm going to give quitting another go tomorrow, I've tried to cut down and can survive on 4-5 cigs a day from 20.

But I'm worried I will miss ciggies on other drugs such as coke or molly which I only use recreationally. I'm going to a rave on sat and going to be rolling in the first time in months

Advice?

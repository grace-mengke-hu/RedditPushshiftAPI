The cravings are hitting me hard right now, 10 months later.

I'm trying my best to stay strong here. I quit smoking 10 months ago and, like most smokers, I had some cravings in the first couple weeks of being smoke free. After those initial first weeks though, I felt way better and the cravings pretty much stopped. Until a couple days ago. 

I have no idea what's going on. I haven't had a cigarette since the week of Christmas 2015, but this past week I have experienced the most intense cravings for a cigarette since I quit.

Has anyone else experienced this? Not really sure what to do here. I'm afraid to hang out with my friends who smoke out of fear that I'll ask to bum one. They probably wouldn't give me one because they know I quit a while ago but just being around it right now is really hard.

Any advice?

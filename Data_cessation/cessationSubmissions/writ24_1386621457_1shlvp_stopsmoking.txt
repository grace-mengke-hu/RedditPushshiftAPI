Nearly a year. Uneasiness persists...

Is this normal? 

It's been up and down, I'm long since wanting to go out and buy a pack. But man I don't feel "happy" most of the time. This last couple years have been challenging for a couple reasons but generally speaking I'm at a meh for past few months. 

Generally been bummed out most of the time. Is this still within the smoking cessation symptoms at this point or is something else going on?

I have a feeling that I wasn't very satisfied with my life as a smoker and that the smoking just helped me put up with it.

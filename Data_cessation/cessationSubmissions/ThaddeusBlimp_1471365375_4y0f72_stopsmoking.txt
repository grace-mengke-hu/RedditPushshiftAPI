Advice for getting parents to quit?

Hey all, anyone have any success in aiding their parents to quit smoking. Both mine are around 60 and have been smoking for around 40 years. I've tried for the last 20 years to get them to quit. My Dad quit for about 4 years but started up again like 12 years ago. I just moved back home recently after 5 years away and I feel I can really try now to help them quit. I've tried propaganda (printing out facts and laying them where they smoke), I've bought them a couple quit smoking books as well as open letters. I've sadly even tried guilting them. I know they have to be committed to do it them selves. My college buddies dad just got diagnosed with stage 3 lung cancer and was given about a month and half to live. I can't even imagine dealing with that. Anyway does anyone have any advice? I've heard hypnotherapy has worked on some people. My mom is on/off chantix and got down to like 4 cigs a day. My dad has gotten bad since he has started his new job. He's up to over a pack and half pack a day. My dads favorite response when I ask him when he's going to quit is "After (insert upcoming holiday)"  yesterday is was "After Labor Day, I promise". I know if I push to hard it will make them less likely to quit. Any advice would be great!

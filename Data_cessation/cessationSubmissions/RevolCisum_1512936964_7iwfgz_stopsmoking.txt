Day 5, after 26 years of pack a day.

I quit for 9 months once about a year ago, still mad I started again.  Biggest issue right now is bloody nose and ear and sinus irritation.  Otherwise, I feel ok.  I'm still using nicotine lozenges but ready to stop them too.  They are hell on my mouth and acid reflux.  I wish this was easier, faster.  Also, my house smells horrible, cleaning like it's my gd job.  

How is everyone else doing?

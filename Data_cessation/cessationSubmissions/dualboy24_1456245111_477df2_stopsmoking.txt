4 years today :)

Well it has been 4 years since I joined this sub, and 4 years since my last cigarette. I must say the only time I think about cigarettes is around this day each year as I come check on my badge. 

For those quitting or who recently quit let me tell you it becomes very easy, and natural to not want to smoke, to the point where the thought and smell of cigarettes is disgusting.

Also use whatever tools you find help, I personally used the patch for the first few months and I found it really did help.

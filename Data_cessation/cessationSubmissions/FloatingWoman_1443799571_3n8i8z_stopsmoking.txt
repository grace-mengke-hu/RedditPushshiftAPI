Tips and Tricks

I'm wondering what tips or mind tricks everyone else is using.  

I have a notebook that I write in every time I have a craving.  I put the date and time, followed by "there is no such thing as just one more cigarette".  It works for me and looking at it, it's obvious that the cravings are fewer the longer I go without smoking.  It's very satisfying to look back, even now after such a short time.  Then I get up and go clean something.  My house is looking wonderful and this might be the first set of holidays that I don't have to rush to get ready for.  :)

So what are you doing when the craving hits?

2 weeks and still struggling :(

I have been smoking since the age of 14. I am now 26 and have been smoking a packet a day for years now. I have tried everything to stop smoking....patches, gum, hypnotherapy, e-cig, cold turkey and even attended 3 days in an Allen Carr clinic and still didn't stop smoking :( I have not smoked for 14 days now and I don't feel any sense of accomplishment or pride I just feel so sad and that I am never going to get over this. Any help would be greatly appreciated as I am driving my partner mad (he's on day 8 and has smoked for 18 years).

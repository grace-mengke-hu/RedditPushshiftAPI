Over two weeks now!

Hey guys, just wanted to check in again. I have gone for over 2 weeks without a cigarette and I feel fantastic. My sinuses have finally healed, I no longer have that incessant cough, I can smell again! My chest is no longer tight upon walking uphill, and I smell a lot nicer now!

Now my only challenge is without the nicotine I have started eating a good bit again. Oh well, one battle at a time I suppose. :)

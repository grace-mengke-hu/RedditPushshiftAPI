Quit 12 days ago.

So .. 12 days ago I quit smoking after 13 years of non stop smoking 1 pack a day. 

I only have one question. When will the sudden urges stop? I can go a whole day without a cigarette and then have a sudden urge out of nowhere to go out for a smoke...

On the other hand. I’m absolutely amazed how eazy it is to take deep breaths! No pain jabs in my chest anymore, no more slimes in my troath. No more “death coughes” in the morning. IT FEELS GREAT.

Ah, one last question; how do you deal with the binge eating?

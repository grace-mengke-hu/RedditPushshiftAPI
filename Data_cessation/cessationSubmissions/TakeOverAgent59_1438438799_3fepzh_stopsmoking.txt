Todays the day

8 years ago i got off meth.
4 months ago i quit smoking pot.
it was hard. but here i sit with a smoke in my hand thinking about how good it felt to be clean and sober.
And going back and forth. I can do this / I cant do this.
Its time. i have been a pack a day smoker since i was 16 (im 32 now) And i have "quit" many times befor.
OK i have delt with addiction befor i will do it again.
This is my last smoke wish me luck

Quit for 5 years, and started again :(

It sucks and I was weak! 

I hadn't smoke for 5 years after quitting, then I went to Europe and started again. Now that I am back in the states I want this upcomming week to be my last.


When I quit last, I remember getting free patches from NYS quit or something along the lines.

I know I will be able to quit, but I do need the patches. Are they still doing these programs where they give free patches or are their newer and better alternatives?


My stamina has definitely gone down in the gym.

Day 5: I haven't vaped so far today. Is that weird?

I almost posted here yesterday, but I was being so whiny and bitchy that I wrote out everything and just put it on my blog. I didn't want my first post to be a diatribe likening my roommate to Hitler because he woke up at the same time as--, then managed to get in the shower before me. Hi, my names Tym. I've been smoking for 16 years, this may be my 2nd or 3rd serious quit attempt that wasn't inspired by not being able to afford the next pack, and I've been using a vaporizer as a crutch for the past few days.

I'm currently on day 5, it's just past noon, and I haven't hit the vape all day. After the way that I was feeling, thinking and (literally) sweating yesterday, I'm really proud of the fact that I woke up in a great mood, came to the hell that is my job, am just about to go to lunch, and haven't had any nicotine intake whatsoever.

I also managed to go to my favorite bar last night, and didn't vape or smoke while I was there for a good hour and a half either. It wasn't until late at night when the cravings got to the "F this" point, but I made it through!

I'd like to thank this sub for all the support that I see being shared here and for pointing me in the direction of Allen Carr's Easyway. I'm not finished reading it yet (ch 15 atm) but I can already tell that my inner monologue is changing for the better. I've been spending a lot of time lurking here whenever I had a craving, or just needed to know that there were others who are where I am, where I have been, and where I hope to be, so thank you all for being here, posting your insights, experiences, and support.

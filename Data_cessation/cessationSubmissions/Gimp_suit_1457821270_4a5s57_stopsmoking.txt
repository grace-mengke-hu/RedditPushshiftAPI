Over 2 weeks

So its been 16 days smoke free and already feeling some amazing benefits. More awake and alert, my stamina at the gym and my recovery time after workouts has improved big time, I can push myself harder than before and feel so.much better and confident in general. Why didn't I do this years ago? Trying to share all my positives and hope it helps people like others have me. Thanks for reading people.

Smokefree for 260 days but still feel like I lack cigarettes to be productive

I really enjoy writing and something about cigarettes and "art" always seemed to be perfect when combining the two. My lack of concentration after quitting has gotten better but I still really miss smoking when doing creative stuff. Has anyone here struggled with something similar?

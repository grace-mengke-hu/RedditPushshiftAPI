So I just finished playing a set

Normally I would be well into chain smoking by now... but I haven’t smoked at all! I feel good about it but also I’m nervous that I’m going to fuck my progress for no reason other than I’m drunk. But drinking doesn’t equal smoking. I have been envisioning this night all week and how I won’t smoke and I’ll be too cool to cave. It helps that some other long-time smokers have quit recently... wish me luck!!

1 week, but I'm really affraid :S

I have been smoking half my life, I started when I was 14 and now I'm 28. I have tried several times to quit, my record was 11 days, but I gave in. Sadly it has become a strong habit for me.  


I have started last Tuesday to quit again. I'm using the app as well, I have finally decided to write here as a cry for help maybe?  
You see the thing is that I have quit my previous job to get some rest, and tomorrow I'll start at the new place. So all in all it should be good, since I've read somewhere that when big lifestyle changes occur it is easy to change small stuff as well. So I've been at home for one week, I haven't even left my apartment until today.  


Today I had to leave the apartment, and it was okay, but I have arrived 15 minutes early to my appointment and I was standing there. Normally my reaction is to light up, but at that moment I have felt awful! It was the strongest craving I have ever had. I was strong, but it still bothers me. What will happen tomorrow?  


New day, new workplace, I'll meet an old (sadly smoking) friend. I'm affraid that I won't be able to say no if somebody offers me a cig. Or after my first day I'll feel the urge to smoke. Or while I'll wait for the bus, or whatever.  


My biggest disappointment in the 4D rule (delay, drink water, deep breathing, do something) is that my cravings are not 2-3 mins long, they are continous. It makes me mad. They are constant, annoying feelings in my mouth and hands. Has anybody else experienced the same?

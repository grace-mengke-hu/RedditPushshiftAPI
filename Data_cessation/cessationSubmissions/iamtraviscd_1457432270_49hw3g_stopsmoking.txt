The fuck, Xyban?!

I was taking Xyban for general depression and cessation needs, and started having odd reactions. First, my vision went to hell in a hand basket. I literally felt like someone changed my glasses on me. And then I got dizziness, a complete inability to eat/keep food down, and a host of other issues. 

So I finally went to ER. Turns out it somehow wrecked havoc on my liver, to the point of potential cirrhosis. I was laid off the next day I showed up to work, even with a doctors note, and am going in in a week for a liver biopsy. 

Is this normal? I'd assume not, but has anyone heard of anything like this? In my ER visit, I had ultrasounds and MRIs, and at one point it was thought that I may have had a small stroke, but my liver is showing some pretty crazy stuff, too.

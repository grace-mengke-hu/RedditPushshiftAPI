One battle at a time!

I have made it 24 days and some change without a cigarette! I have had good days and bad, not sure how I made it through the family bs. It isn't easy but it is worth doing. I am avail3if anyone needs to chat about their battle! Keep going strong the number of days doesn't matter it is about the effort!

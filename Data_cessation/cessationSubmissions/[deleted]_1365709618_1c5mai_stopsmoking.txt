I had my baby, now I want a cigarette.

I didn't smoke for my entire pregnancy. Once that test came back positive I stopped (for the second time). Now that I've had my baby all I can think about is smoking again. Its been 12 days since he was born. :(

I thought that my sons wouldn't be influenced if I didn't smoke. But a few days ago my two year old pointed out "Nana smokes". And now I feel like there's no reason for me not to.

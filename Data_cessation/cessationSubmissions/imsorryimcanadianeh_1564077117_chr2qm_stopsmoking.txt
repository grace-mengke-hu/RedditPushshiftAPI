FYI, Insurance Programs may cover your NRT

Hey everyone,

I just wanted to let everyone know that NRT may be covered fully by your Health Insurance, whether it's Universal or Private. 

I happened to visit a pharmacy here in Canada, and the pharmacist informed me that with either my private or government insurance, I could apply for a consultation, then receive a prescription for smoking cessation products in as fast as 30 minutes. 

After doing some calculations, I'm finding I'm only paying 20% of the original cost. 

In addition, with this subsidy, I'll be much more inclined to keep with NRT until the psychological factor is gone. 

So far I'm Day 2 of my quit, and I'm finding it the easiest method so far. I know I'm still addicted to nicotine, but for me the hardest part has always been the association. I'm hopeful that NRT will help me bridge the gap until I'm ready to wean off nictoine. At the very least, I'll be gaining the health benefits of not inhaling 10 cigarettes a day. 

I'm sure many of you already know this, but I wanted to state it here in case there are other people ignorant of this amazing fact. 

Wishing you all the best on your journey to being smoke-free!

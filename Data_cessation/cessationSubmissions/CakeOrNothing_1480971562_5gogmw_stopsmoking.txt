I want want want to give up smoking

I desperately want to give up smoking but I don't think I can do it, I've got a date in mind (new years, cheesy I know) I just want to hear from people who have done it successfully or will be trying soon themselves, I've smoked for so long I can't remember a time when I didn't smoke, It's fucked up my teeth and general health and I just need to do this but I can't on my own, Family and friends aren't very supportive and don't tend to listen to me. Please help. Tell me your success stories or how you plan to give up. 
I realise posts like this are common but I really need some help.

i miss it, but also i don't miss it.

It's been 18 days smoke-free. I am 26y old and started smoking when I was 17. I have quit many times, but always ended up going back to cigarettes. This time it was my master thesis, but the day I handed it in, I quit. These past 2 weeks I have been exercising a lot, and feel very happy about it. 
Of course, I miss the "happy cigarettes", those you smoke in company after a dinner with your friends, or those you smoke during a lovely sunny day. I also miss the "depressed cigarettes", those you smoke when you had a shitty day, and you feel blue. BUT, the thing is, I cannot only smoke one cigarette in such moments, once in a while. Nicotine is a fucking addiction, so you smoke in every kind of situation, and actually get mad when you don't have any cigarettes left and the shops are closed. It's a filthy habit.
So, I believe this time around is different for me: I am so happy to be free from cigarettes. Freedom is a wonderful feeling! Try it!

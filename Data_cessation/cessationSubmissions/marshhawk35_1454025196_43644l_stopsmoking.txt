Passed 6 weeks and didn't even realize it!

It's not like I don't still think about smoking. Some days it is on my mind a lot. But you know what's different? I'm not CRAVING smoking probably 80% of the time it crosses my mind. And I just realized today I actually passed six weeks and didn't even catch the milestone, because I'm not thinking about it nearly as much.

This....this is progress, my friends. Smoking made me feel so hopeless about everything. I feel hopeful again.

My newest motivator is keeping track of the big triggers getting less trigger-ey as time passes. I stopped craving a cigarette while driving or after dinner for the most part, as an example. Still got some big ones - that "reward" cigarette trigger right after work is a bitch - but they are getting less severe. If you're finding yourself getting tired or demotivated, try tracking your triggers and celebrate them fading one by one.

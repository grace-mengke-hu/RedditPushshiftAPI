Smoking since 4 years - killing me - unable to quit

I have been smoking since 4 years now - since I was 19 

I started with 2 a day which continued for half a year maybe, then increased to 3, and gradually in a year and a half, I was smoking 5-7/ day, and more if I was also drinking. 

Been smoking 10-15 a day since 2 years now. 

Tried quitting several times in the past year, with the stints lasting between a week to a month. 

Every time it starts again with that ONE cigarette. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to avoid falling into the trap again. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know that if I take a puff from someone after I decide to quit, it won't be just a puff anymore. Should I try reducing and then quitting or should I again attempt to go cold turkey?

&amp;#x200B;

it's just that every time I quit and then start again, it shatters my self confidence for the future. 

&amp;#x200B;

Smoking is impacting my health - I know it affects my stamina/ my running pace/ my teeth are yellowing and I have to regularly get them cleaned. 

&amp;#x200B;

Pls help me.

Another thing that scares me is stories of people who quit for a year and then relapse. it's like this disease never leaves us. what do i do?

I need serious help to quit my dad smoking. Please help!

Look, I can't handle this anymore. It's scaring me shitless, and I don't want my father to die. But his smoking addiction has gone too far. 

I'm 15 years old and live in Ontario, Canada. My dad used to be a very heavy smoker. Smoking at least two packs a day. It was horrible. He was also diagnosed with Sleep Apnea. 

He was clean for a good year or two but he started again. One or two smokes a day, nothing too bad. He said he had it under control. I trusted him. He tried stopping again by using Nicotine Gum. It was working! He was slowing stopping to smoke. 

But in the past few months, he has been smoking heavily. I mean 2-3 packs a day heavy. It's bad. I tried to talk to my mother about it, but she didn't care. I don't know how she could watch her husband just smoke himself to death?! That's not even the worst part.

He has at least 6-8 smokes in the morning. Everyday. I don't know how many in the afternoon, but I'm going to guess it's even more. 

I wrote here because of the most recent thing he did. He has an ash tray, and I usually clean it out (dumping in the garbage). About 5 minutes ago, he finished his pack of cigarettes. And the next thing he did was just...horrible to me. He went right to the garbage looking for cigarettes. No, I'm not joking. He went right to it, dug in and found about 3-4 cigarettes to smoke. It was disgusting. I was very shocked and never thought he would do that...

I went to tell my mother, but all she said was "Stop annoying your father" and gave me a stink eye.

I don't know what to do anymore. It feels like no one in my family cares about my Fathers health, and I don't know what to do. 

Please help! I don't know what to do...I could use every little piece of advice I can get!

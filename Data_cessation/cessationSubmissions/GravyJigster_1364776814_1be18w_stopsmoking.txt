Almost through day three....getting tough

I spent day one and two at home around family that doesn't smoke, so I almost forgot about it (the thought came up, but it would be too much of  a hassle). Now though, I'm back at my dorm, with my buddies many of whom smoke and I am just itching to bum a cigarette. I don't know if I can do this. Fuck.

Was having panic attacks, but came on here and am feeling much better

I just finished Allen Carr's book today.  I am feeling good about being done smoking and have no desire to do so at all anymore.  I'm very relieved to feel free of it, especially since I wasn't smoking all that much to begin with.  I had about 3 a week or so on weekends, while drinking with friends.  I don't know why I held onto it for so long when I really don't care about it and think it's disgusting when I'm not drinking.

However, reading the book over the past 3 days and focusing on the idea of smoking so much has made me feel incredibly sick for some reason.  I'm at the point now where I'm coughing up brown gunk every morning.  I've been getting headaches and feeling weak and tired every day.  I've been having panic attacks, and today it was so severe that I thought I may pass out.  I was hyperventilating and feeling short of breath.

I came on this subreddit looking for some reassurance, and was happy to find it.  I've read some of your accounts of feeling sick or panicky after quitting, and that it's normal and can even be a good sign.

I just want to say thank you all for sharing your experiences.  I'm feeling very calm and much more optimistic now, which is physically making this much easier to get through.

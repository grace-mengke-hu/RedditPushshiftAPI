I just had a bronchial spasm, then coughed up something terrible and it was amazing.

Has this happened to anyone else?  Woke up at 2am, could barely get air in or out, produced tonnes of dark phlegm. I was scared out of my mind, coughed up an impressive amount of blood with it.. after it all calmed down, i feel fucking amazing, my voice isnâ€™t anywhere near as grumbly and my breathing is far easier than it was before the event.

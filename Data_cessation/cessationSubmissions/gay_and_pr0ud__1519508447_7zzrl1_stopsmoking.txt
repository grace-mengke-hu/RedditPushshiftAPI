Bought an e-cig. Smoked wax. Now worried

So I bought an ecig recently and got pretty high. Whole already high and kind of numb to pain, I took a big ass hit and held it in for a while. Sometimes now when laughing really hard I start coughing. Could I have fucker up my lungs? Could I have reduced their capacity significantly?

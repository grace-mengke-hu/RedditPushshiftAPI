Weekends are hardest!!!

Hi guys!! For me the weekend are the hardest time to resist the craving for smoking. I felt like the daily basis of work gym and home was a lot more easier to manage, than the hanging out with friends on the weekends. Most of my friends don't smoke so i have that in my favor, but there's something about the weekend that takes the craving much more hard to control.

I'm going with two weeks now free smoking, and thou i'm very motivated about quitting i feel like i am a bad weekend away of making mistakes. This one was particulary dificullt. Had to come here to this group and read your posts to remind me why i'm doing this.

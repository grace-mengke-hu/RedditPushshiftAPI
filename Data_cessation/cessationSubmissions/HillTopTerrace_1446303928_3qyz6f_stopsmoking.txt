Anyone Slip Up?

I did not smoke for over 5 days. Then last night while drinking wine, I decided to have one. Alcohol is obviously my biggest trigger. I am not craving one today, and won't smoke. But anyone else have a slip up during their quitting process? Did I just ruin all my recovery process in regards to health and withdrawal symptoms?

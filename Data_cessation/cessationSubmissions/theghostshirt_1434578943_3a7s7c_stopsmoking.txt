Ramadan and quitting

For us muslims, ramadan has officially started, which means long hours -about 16 hours where I live- of not eating, drinking and of course not smoking. As a long time smoker, and many times unsuccessful trier of quitting, I thought this might be a good opportunity of giving it a try and my best shot. I am planning to read Allen Carr's book during day time to get some motivation. 
I just wanted to share my plan and wish all of us who are trying during this holy month good luck.

Just had a fall down after 88 days going cold turkey.

Feel a bit ashamed of myself, but not that much. Quitting is easy (IMO) but its sustaining it thats hard. After a few months i tend to forget why i stopped smoking (not my first time ive been going long without a smoke), my convictions blows away into thin smoke and there's a new enemy in front me.

To all ex-smokers of reddit, how do you do you keep it up and never smoke again (willingly)? I feel like ive beaten physical addiction of it, but the ''psychological'' addiction is a whole new game... need help.
I was in a bit of a hurry to post this, im leaving town for a few days to think on it. 

*EDIT*
**I wanted to thank everyone for their comforting comments and never i would have thought to get such amazing comments as these ones, mostly because of how botched i started this post, but truly my friends, i thank you all and I have no intention of going through winter with my bad habit, I shall keep you all updated in the following months, and for all those who have quitted, keep on going and dont look back!**

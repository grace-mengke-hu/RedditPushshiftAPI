Day 3 was always such a bitch.

If you're like me, you are quitting all the time. "After this weekend." "After this pack." "After the holidays." I've always been a good day-1 quitter. Day-2 is hit or miss, but if I made it to day 3, that's when I slip. "I'll just have one, I've done very well." Then that turns into 3 or 4. 

Well, yesterday was day 3 and I'm into day 4. I think I'm really going to make it this time. It feels right. I've quit before and had 10+ years of no smoking, so I know this might just be it. My wife is still smoking so that's hard. I'm also doing the dry January, Drynuary. I'm not finding the no drinking hard and I'm not having withdrawals in that regard. I think, maybe the quitting smoking is easier because I'm not drinking.

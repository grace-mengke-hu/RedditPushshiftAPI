10 hours in and I'm going crazy

I've literally only been awake and actively not smoking for about two hours and I'm already going crazy. I both can't believe I've made it through these last two hours and can't imagine how I'm going to make it through the rest of the day. Any encouraging words will help from those of you who have been through this.

Btw, 29 years old, smoking since I was 18, wearing Nicoderm CQ Step 1 patch, so this isn't even nicotine withdrawal, just mental. And my arm kind of itches.

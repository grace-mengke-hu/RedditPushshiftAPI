Ex smoker for 17 minutes.

Going cold turkey, gradually decreasing didn't work out. There are no more cigarettes in the house.

I've installed (oh, a butterfly just flew in through the window, must be a sign) all the quit smoking android apps I could find. I've requested a badge. I've bought nicotine chewing gum should the need become dire (and it will) but I don't plan to use them. 

This is my summer holiday, I'm off work, I'm doing this now because I expect to become completely dysfunctional the next handful of days.

It has now been 17 minutes since I smoked what I hope was my very last cigarette. The withdrawal is hereby invited to hit me like a truck.

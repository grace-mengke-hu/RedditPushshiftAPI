Just starting

So, I got this random cold out of the blue on Monday.  No warning when it hit and I was barely awake for the first 3 days.  Day 2 was at Urgent Care and antibiotics.  So, since then, I've hardly smoked.  

It wasn't until Friday that I felt the withdrawals and agitation.  I started using a patch so I didn't kill the others residing with me including my own spawn. Yeah, I took a drag or two as well. I still haven't smoked a whole cigarette since last Sunday.

I'm bored though.  Bored senseless.  I have SO much more spare time and it's driving me crazy.  Add that I'm on heavy steroids for this bug I've got so I'm even hungrier.  Thanks to said bug, I can't taste much so NOTHING satisfies. Uggghhh!

I need strength.

Was/ Wasn't Prepared


Small blog while I wait for my mom to get out of knee therapy.

So I was prepared for mood swings, I've felt straight rage or extreme depression/guilt. I'm a pretty passive person, though while driving now I've been screaming at other drivers who try to rush me into oncoming traffic, etc. Saying a lot of "F you" quietly or yelling "WHO SPILLED THE F****** BUTTER!!" etc, when by myself. Real tender around the nerves you know. Bought the wrong buns for my dad to cater brisket sandwiches at an event, felt super guilty, etc. Did the whole "Why does my fiance want to be with me" bit (he's really wonderful btw) felt bad for snapping at him these past couple of days. Lots of self-reflection, not feeling real proud of myself, realizing I need to get back to the things I loved to occupy my mind. Gotta pick back up my saxophone and that PS4 I spent money on. What gets me is boredom, but I've just felt unmotivated to do anything except when I get these adrenaline surges to smoke... then I'm out the door going anywhere. Being by myself is the worst, or in a room with someone where no one is talking. I also liked going out every once in a while to drink, would get a good buzz and using the whole "Well I'm going outside to smoke" to get away from conversation. I enjoy sitting outside, just feels kind of less enjoyable right now. Rambling, I know. Everything annoys me right now. I hear myself talk and think "Jesus skateboarding Christ can I complain any more?".

Anyway, prolly TMI but...
Was not ready for constipation lol. Makes me more edgy. I cut out sugar a month ago, been eating extremely healthy. Meats and mainly veggies, only eating fruit for sugars. I was feeling pretty good! Lots of fiber. Lots of water. So...be aware lol. Putting down the nicotine may do this to you even if you don't turn to snacking to occupy your hand-mouth habit. 

And this is short of 72 hours. 

Press on, y'all.

TLDR: Extreme mood swings, can't poop.

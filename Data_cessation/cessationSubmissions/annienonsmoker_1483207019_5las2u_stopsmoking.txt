Huge argument, wanting to smoke

Hey all. Sorry to come on here and be sad on New Years Eve... just had a massive argument with my other half and am desperately trying to fight the urge to smoke. I know it's my think to smoke when I'm stressed/upset and most of the time I can manage the cravings but this argument was huge and I think things might be over. Please could someone talk me out of going out to buy cigarettes.... PLEASE! :( when I told him I was going to go and buy some he told me to go and get them too, which hasn't helped xx

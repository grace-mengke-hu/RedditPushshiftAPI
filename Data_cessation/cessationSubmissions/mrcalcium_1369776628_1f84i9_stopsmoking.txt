Five days with no nicotine.

I had been a smoker for almost 6 years. Over the past few months my mindset changed from "I fucking love smoking," to "I fucking hate smoking." I don't know why it happened, but after a few futile attempts at quitting, I sent myself on a trip to an isolated cottage in Canada with only 1 pack, and somehow managed to convinced\ myself I would have enough for an entire week. I was out of smokes after the second day. I had no way to get any nicotine in me for almost 4 days.  I got through the first few days of cravings by not having any way to curb them, and working outside. After getting home, I've had multiple opportunities to bum a smoke, and have stopped myself thus far. This is the longest I've gone without any nicotine in 6 years. Also toothpicks help a lot.

It's been 93 hours and 13 minutes since my last cig.

Longest I've ever gone without smoking, and I've smoked since I was 15 (26 now). 

First two days were surprisingly fairly easy. Then while at work the next evening is when the withdrawal mobile smashed right into me. Now I understand why it's so hard for people to quit. And yet I feel more determined now than ever. 

I'm going through symptoms like a really bad flu. Feels like I have a fever, extreme nausea, aching body, headaches (those fucking headaches), complete foggy brained. It's like I just woke up after a night of going on a heroin binge. Dry eyes, itchy nose, nose bleeds. Rushes of anxiety, which pass, and then I'm fine. 

In a way I'm okay with this phase, as even the thought of having a cig makes me want to vomit, and I probably would if I even took one drag of one. I would have thought I wouldn't be able to handle it and go straight to the smoke shop, but feeling this awful has made me feel the complete opposite. As I'd never want to go through this process again. 

Anyway, I'm rambling and I don't have much of a point. But did anyone else have flu like symptoms when they quit? Or feel completely lethargic and kind of spaced out at times? Or unable to sleep long periods no matter how exhausted you felt? 

Will it still be like this this time next week? 

That's all. <3

Don't give up, giving up that is... 

Hey all, this is just a quick message to say the we can do this and to keep positive. 

I was scrolling down my news feed and I keep reading people saying how they have had to reset or that they need help. I just wanted to put out there that when you have reset your badge you are starting again, you are not going back to smoking all the time you had a slip up and that happens. The fact that you are here and that you have reset and trying again is kind of great when you think about it. 

To everyone who needs help, I don't know if this will work for you but stop take a big deep breath and stop, just for a second slow the fuck down and think. Think about how hard it is to quit and how if you can help it you don't want to have to quit again. 

Keep trying. Don't let five minutes of your brain sending you false signals trick you into thinking you need a ciggie, you don't. 

I am now going to go full on caps. 

WE CAN DO THIS!

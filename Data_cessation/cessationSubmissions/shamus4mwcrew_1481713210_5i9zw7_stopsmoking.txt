I could use any tips or help.

I'm having a lot of trouble lately and I actually made a good stretch without smoking at all.  I made it 11 days and then caved and had one and now I'm about 4 days into where I've been smoking at night.  Something came over me that 11th day and I just went a little crazy and decided to have one because that would be better than me having a drink or doing a drug that would end up leading me to drink.  I'm a recovering alcoholic and I've been sober for a little over a year and a half now so I didn't want to do anything to jeopardize that.  I made it fine, well a bit crazy for those 11 days but the anxiety is what finally caught up with me.  I'd basically chew gum and take vitamin C and B12 whenever I got a craving.  I read somewhere a long time ago about the vitamins and I don't know if they're anything but a placebo but you piss them out anyway so you can't overdose on them.  I can make it through the whole day just fine like that but lately I've been caving at night.  I guess it's better than full-out smoking but it's prolonging the whole ordeal.  I successfully quit once years ago but started smoking again when I started drinking again.  Luckily my mind is set on not drinking so that shouldn't be a problem.  I guess it's harder for me because I had real reasons to quit drinking other than health.  I was doing completely insane stupid shit when drunk and not doing anything with my life.  Anyway sorry if this was long but any tips on how to deal with the anxiety or anything else that works to not smoke like me chewing gum.  I need to quit I want to be healthy all around or at least as healthy as I can be. I'm 35 and I've been smoking for almost 20 years minus the few times I quit, I want to quit while I still have a chance at not having too serious of health problems.

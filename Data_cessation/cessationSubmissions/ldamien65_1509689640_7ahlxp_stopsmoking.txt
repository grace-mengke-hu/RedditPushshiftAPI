Staying clean of drugs AND cigarettes

Hey Reddit,
So I recently went through a treatment center for 2 weeks (insurance wouldn't cover the full 30 days) and came out feeling better than I've felt in months. Since it was a completely smoke-free facility, I went 14 days without smoking cigarettes and I've decided to try and keep it that way. What is the point of continuing a habit that's very harmful to my body after getting rid of  the physical dependency that has kept me smoking all these years? My sponsor told me that in order to stay sober there is only one thing that you must change and that is everything. I interpreted it as a hint to give up all my damaging habits and replace them with healthy, wholesome activities such as exercise and meditation. Although it may be a struggle for me considering the fact that most of the people who attend 12 step meetings abuse the hell out of cigarettes and coffee, I feel like I can manage to end both of my addictions. In my mind, if any sort of substance has the least amount of control over my actions and thoughts and can become a compulsive obsession, then I must let it go. Hopefully I'll be successful in both endeavors and bring an end to the "old me". Wish the best for all you guys out there trying to quit.

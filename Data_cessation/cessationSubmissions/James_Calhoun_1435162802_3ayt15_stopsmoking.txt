One week smoke-free. Cravings are heavy today

So today marks as one week smoke-free, it feels great! I owe it to all of you guys, you really helped me out.

Today the cravings are really bad, though. I am currently in the middle of exams and just received the results. One passed, one failed and for one I'm still waiting on the results. Really all I want to do is light a cigarette for stress relief. Pff.

Day 3 after 6 years of smoking (ages 14-20). I can't take it anymore

Besides a 9-month break before turning 18 I have smoked nearly every day since I was 14. Since I turned 18 I have never been without cigarettes (quite literally) and averaged over a pack a day. And I can't take it. It's horrible. I'm actually *hungry* and therefore I need to cook, which means I also need to do the dishes. I am lazy as *fuck* so this is the worst side-effect imaginable. I guess I'll have to go through the rest of my life preparing three meals a day. 

No other side-effects though, except for my dreams which seem to only be about smoking.

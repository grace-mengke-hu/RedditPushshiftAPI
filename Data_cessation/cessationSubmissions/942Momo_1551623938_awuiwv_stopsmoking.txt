Gaining weight after quitting...

Hello everyone, I’ve found myself eating so much more after quitting smoking. It’s as if my appetite is on 24/7 and I just can’t stop munching. I’ve made an effort to quit soda’s too but I’ve put on 5kg in such a little amount of time (1month to be precise). 
Obviously going to the gym would help, but I’m trying to find alternatives to make me feel less bored and hungrier. 

Note: I am not obese or overweight. I am 165cm and weigh 60kg. My normal weight is 55kg and is when I feel healthy and my jeans actually fit!

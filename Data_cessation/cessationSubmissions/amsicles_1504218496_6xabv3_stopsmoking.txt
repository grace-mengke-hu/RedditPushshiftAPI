What are your mantras?

I'm at the grand old stage of 11 days in. I've been away from all triggers so it's been fine so far - the challenge will come next week when I'm back among my friends who all smoke, the bars, drinking, parties etc. 

So I've been stockpiling useful mantras - the whole "not one puff" thing doesn't really do it for me, so I've been leaning on "smoking is rank and it'll kill you in a really painful and boring way", but it got me thinking - does anyone else have a good phrase or mantra that's got them through tough times?

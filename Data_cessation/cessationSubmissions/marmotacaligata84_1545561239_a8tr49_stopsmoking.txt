This feels like flying on an air plane that never lands. I'm thru my first 24 hrs, but feel 100% miserable.

It's 1:30 AM.  I woke up with a hard start around midnight and haven't really been able to get back to sleep.  I'm flopping around on the bathroom floor, listening to the Cold War Kids.  The cravings are hard, and heavy.  I've thought about sneaking back behind the house and digging through the garbage can for some of the smokes we threw out yesterday.  But... I haven't. 

But I keep thinking about it. 

I live in rural Alaska, so anywhere I could possibly get tobacco products is CLOSED.  No 24 hr gas stations, or whathaveyou.  I'm on my own here. Even if I wanted to "break" and smoke... there's no where to even purchase tobacco for the next few days. It's officially over. 

It feels a lot like flying in an airplane that just won't land. Weather delays, busy runways, etc. The withdrawals are brutal. So. Flipping. Brutal. 

Someone please tell me this gets easier.

So happy this isn't an April Fool's joke. Today is my one-year no-smoke-iversary.

Just over one year ago, my longtime girlfriend left me and I decided the first step to move on was to improve myself. Smoking was the first thing to go. I had been smoking about half a pack a day for 8 years or so.

To all you new quitters out there - it's hard work that requires constant vigilance but it is so worth it. You are the most important person in your life, so stick around as long as you can! The rest of you - good work and keep it up! Looking forward to seeing you all on here for a long time to come.

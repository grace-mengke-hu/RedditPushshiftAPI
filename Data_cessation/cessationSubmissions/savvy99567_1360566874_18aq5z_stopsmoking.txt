411 days since I quit!

I honestly can't believe it has been over a year. I quit because i became pregnant. Well this is my third child. I quit with the other two and started as soon as i could. With this one it was somehow different. It's hard to stop, heck it's hard to do anything your not used to doing everyday. Take it one day at a time, and you can do anything.
Good luck fellow quitters!

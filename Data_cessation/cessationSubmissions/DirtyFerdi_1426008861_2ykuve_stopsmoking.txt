Are you guys all cold turkey or...?

I've been struggling with quitting for a few weeks now. I decided I was going to stop smoking cigs along with drinking, and smoking pot. Obviously this has been a very difficult task, and quitting cigs has been the most difficult. 

I was already not a super heavy smoker (mostly when I was drinking, but about a pack a week), and thought it should be pretty easy. I was wrong. 

I bought patches, the second step. Since I didn't smoke every day to begin with I didn't use the patch every day, and on the days I didn't use them my cravings were even worse than when I was actually smoking. I'm wondering if the patches could have made my cravings worse or if I am just a dumb-dumb for not using them every day. 

I have been smoking still, but MUCH less than before (I've had the same pack for the last 3 weeks). Have y'all cut down like this or do you just stop totally?

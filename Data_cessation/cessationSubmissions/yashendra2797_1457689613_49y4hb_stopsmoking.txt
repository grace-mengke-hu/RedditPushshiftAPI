After nearly 5 months of quitting cigarettes, I'm now gonna quit the gums. Can you guys help to stop me from freaking out and eating the kitchen?

Hey there!

I'm a 19 year old college student living in New Delhi, India with his parents. I started smoking when I was 17 and smoked continuously for a little bit more than a year. When my addiction went to 40 cigarettes a day I told my parents that I needed help. I don't hide anything from them, and they're pretty awesome so they helped me out with moral support and by fronting the cost of the Nicotine Gums.

Fast forward 147 days. After 2 slip ups, 5 kilos gained, 1.5 kilos lost and over a dozen bad situations I'm now quitting the nicotine gums. I supplemented one crutch with another and now it time to stand on my fuckin feet. I was wondering if you guys had any ideas on how to make the switch and how to deal with the constant hunger. I've eaten 2 packets of ramen, 3 wraps and drank 1 l of OJ in the past 12 hours. I don't know how to stop.

In case anyone's wondering, I've been completely nicotine free for 12 hours 28 minutes now.

Well, I'm going to sleep. Will check the responses when I wake up. Thanks guys, and DFTBA!

**TL; DR: After 147 days off cigarettes, I'm 12 hours off Nicotine Gums and I don't know how to cope with the irritation, anxiety and hunger.**

EDIT: I took 4-7 Nicotex 4 mg gums everyday till about 3 weeks ago when I made the switch to 2 mg, effectively halving my dose.

Two weeks down

I'm feeling really good this week. Last weekend went pretty far south. It was an ugly time, but luckily at home and not at work. My poor husband. 

He has an appointment to get chantix this coming Friday, so at least, right now, I'm feeling on a more even keel to be able to help him.

I was surprised at how little I thought about it this week. We had a lot of snacks at work, and we are all basically showering each other with candy. I am learning a lot of my coworkers are former smokers, and I never would have guessed. So that is really encouraging.

Something that really scares me, inspired by another post I just saw on the front page of this sub: my mom's younger sister (my mom is the middle of three) died last year after battling colon cancer for a few years. It metastasized to her liver. My younger cousin, who told me when she was 8, 12, and 16 that she would never smoke because it was disgusting, took it up sometime in the last few years, as both her parents smoked and I think it was just normal for her. But, my grandfather has told me that no one in his family who has smoked has lived to be older than 60, and my aunt dying last year at 54 (I think) really hit it home. Like, damn, grandad, you're not fucking around. He just had to bury his youngest child. I would definitely not like to outlive any of my future children, if I can help it. Ugh.

So, some food for thought, fellow quitters. We're all in this together, we can all do it, surely, because we had times in our lives when we did not smoke, and life was normal, because none of us were lighting up straight out of the womb (I hope). We just have to re-learn normal.

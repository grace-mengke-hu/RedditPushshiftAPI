1000 hours smoke free!

The day I decided to stop smoking and downloaded the smoke free app I saw that badge saying: 1000 hours smoke free and I thought, darn that's a long way to go and needs determination. 
Reached it today... Just saying... 
Was not easy but it's so WORTH it and I am very proud to continue staying smoke free. If I can do it, we can ALL do it!!!

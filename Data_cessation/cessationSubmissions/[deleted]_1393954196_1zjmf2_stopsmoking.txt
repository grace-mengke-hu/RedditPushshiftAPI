Nine days today, and I want to rip my hair out (well, what little I have left).

Quick rant: I'm 28, male, I've been a smoker for around 15 years. I'm on 9 days today. I am a freelance writer and work in PR. Almost everything I do is attached to smoking. When I'm writing, involved in the creative process, I always go outside, walk around, smoke a cigarette or two, have some coffee. That's all I want to do right now. My cravings didn't even start until around day 7. It's all mental. I'm so conditioned to want a cigarette during certain tasks. I realize it's about deprogramming myself. I could scream, though. I would like to fucking scream. Anyone have similar experiences? Make me feel better, tell me about them.

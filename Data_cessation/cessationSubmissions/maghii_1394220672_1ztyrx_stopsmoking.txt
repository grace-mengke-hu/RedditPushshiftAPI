What did you " replace " cigarettes with?

I've been a smoker for 5 years, but decided to stop cold turkey on Jan 1st 2014. Haven't touched a cigarette in 2+ months, however I somehow I've found myself gaining 5 kg ( 10 pounds in think) without even noticing. I tried paying a bit more attention and I noticed that I do eat A LOT more, but it's not even a kind of " I'm bored, don't know what to do with myself" binge eating, I actually do feel really hungry all the time.
So instead of replacing cigarettes with food I started drinking diet coke, but obviously that's not going to do much for my health.
I tried just drinking water when I get these strange cravings ( I don't really know how to explain them, it's not really specific cigarette cravings, just "cravings") but it just doesn't satisfy me.
So what do you guys do instead of smoking??

What motivational phrases do you use when facing a rough patch?

Personally, I love Death by Stereo's "Forever and a Day"

I can't take away this fever

I can't take away this pain

But I will fight with you forever, forever and a day.

I can't face this world on my own

I keep on searching for your face,

But I will fight with you forever, 

Forever and a day

Thank You

Thank you to the recent posts and anyone currently posting/responding. I'm currently out drinking (drunk) for my birthday and am only 2 days quit at this point. It's super hard to not ask someone to bum a cig and I keep coming to this sub for support/reassurance. I know it's unwise to drink while first trying to quit. Thank you for any help either directly or indirectly (on other posts). I'm so thankful for this sub.

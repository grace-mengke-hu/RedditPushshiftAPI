Giving NRT a try

I've tried a lot of ways of quitting, and they pretty much all involve the mind-over-matter approach. Obviously, that's not been working for me, since I'm still smoking about a pack a day. I'm sick of it and definitely have way more self-loathing than relaxation or comfort when I light up a new one. Truth be told, I'm really scared to quit. Scared of not having that security blanket, scared of failing again, and just in general scared of doing something outside of my routine.

So, I'm quitting with a patch. They show up, along with a box of Quit Tea, on Friday. Wish me luck.

Just Reset My Badge

I quit for over a year... and then started smoking again. There wasn't even anything bad that happened to make me start. I was coming from a happy hour with my best friend and just bought a pack. I've had lots of happy hours/alcohol in the past year, so I've been trying to figure out what was different and actually caused me to smoke to help me this time, but I'm coming up with nothing. 

Anyway, I bought that pack and said it would be a one time thing, bought another and said I'd quit after that one, then another and another and now I've been smoking ~2 months. No one in my life knows I'm smoking, I'm not smoking during work or around others- I wait until I'm alone and then practically chain smoke.  

I feel awful- emotionally, of course, but also physically. The gross cough is back. People keep asking if I have a cold or allergies. I have no energy and I'm sick of smoking again. I put my last cigarette into my Smoke Free app, which helped a lot last time I quit and I know I have a lot of skills/tools from my last quit to apply here, but I'm still nervous I won't be able to do it. 

Does anyone have any tips for quitting again after a significant relapse? The lying smoking part of my brain keeps telling me I've thrown it all away and should just keep smoking, but I know I want to go back to non smoking. SO badly. Thanks in advance for any advice!

Celebrating my double-century against the nics

I'm not very good at keeping track of milestones. 

So imagine my surprise when I checked in this morning and saw that I've been smoke-free now for 200 days!

I can't say that it has been easy, especially on long drives... 

but I get through it by telling myself that quitting smoking is *not* hard. I just have weak will power and staying quit will make me stronger.

**Remember - you are bigger than your impulses and desires.**

Do your best!

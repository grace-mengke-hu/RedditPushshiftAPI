Going for a new attempt.

I just requested badgebot to remove my lie of a badge (535 days)  That was the last time I tried to quit and failed about 13 days in.  I am going to do this using a BLU e-cig, at least until I feel more comfortable.  I have bee smoking for about 26 years, and have tried nicotine gum and lozenges.  They didn't work, I have had past coworkers and supervisors use chantix and welbutrin and each and every one of them seemed changed.  Kinda like that episode of Spongebob, where he's all smooth and calm.  Anyway, wish me luck.

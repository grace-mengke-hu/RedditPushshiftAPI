Hey. Are you someone recently diagnosed with cancer who is trying to quit smoking? Here is a resource available.

Heyy. I work with a research team at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center that specializes in smoking cessation. We have developed a quit smoking resource for cancer patients. Smoking can be such a comforting thing, and especially in the super stressful time after a diagnosis. Quitting smoking can be one of the best things you can do to support oncology treatment. That's why we've developed an app, that we are testing in a scientific pilot research trial.

Also, if you're reading this just out of curiosity--and you don't have a cancer diagnosis, we are also recruiting for a QuitBot  a study comparing two programs for adults quitting smoking. That website is [www.quitbot.org](https://www.quitbot.org)

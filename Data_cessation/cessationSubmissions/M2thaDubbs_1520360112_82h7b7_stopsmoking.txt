I think I'm ready

I've been smoking for 14 years with a 2 year break a couple of years ago when I got pregnant and had my daughter. I started again when I was going through a divorce. So stupid, I know. 

I've been naturally cutting back here and there. I just haven't wanted to as much. Some days are worse than others, but I really think that reading advice here and allen carr's book has finally started "working". I don't want to be a smoker anymore. I think I'm setting tomorrow or the next day as my quit date.

Any words of encouragement? Advice? Something to push me from thinking I'm ready to just being done with it?

OMG! On Chantix, losing my mind. But I can't afford to slip up this time. I have to get through this!

This is my third time on Chantix, and it has to be the last.  The stakes are too high now.  I have to get off cigarettes.  I have to break my addition.

I had to stop taking Chantix the last time because it was seriously messing with my head.   I was angry all the time.  Angry at everything and nothing.  So angry, I couldn't function in the world.  It got so bad that smoking, as bad as that was, was better.

So I'm on Chantix again.  Cigarettes taste absolutely awful now, which is great.  But I'm going through a whole ton of emotions.  Yesterday was my quit date, and I had 3 today.  I felt like I had to do something to make the crazy feelings go away.  The smoke still tasted like garbage.  I took my evening dose of Chantix just now, and a nicotene lozenge and I'm feeling a bit better.  I'm not going back to smoking.  

Just needed someone to talk to.

Trying this again, but changing it up a little.

Hey guys, so this is my third "I'm quitting" post here and I'm two days through my most recent foray into not being unhealthy and smelly. I'm 31 years old and I've been smoking a pack a day for 16 of those years.

I've tried quitting twice before, and gone cold turkey both times. The first time I made it about two months before I fell into the "I can handle this. I'll just have a couple smokes with my buddies while I'm drinking." trap and within a week I was back up to a pack a day. The second time was last month and I broke on the 5th day. Pathetic, I know.

I hear that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. So I'm trying something other than cold turkey this time. I'm using an e-cig.

I know some people here look down on e-cigs because they technically don't help you break your addiction, but at this point I feel like being addicted to e-cigs would be a giant step forward from being addicted to cigarettes. And I have to say, it's been two days since I had a real cigarette, and I'm doing fine. Better than fine, even.

So I'm choosing to view overcoming my addiction as a journey rather than a huge, all-in-one life change. I don't know if it will work. Maybe weaning myself off of the e-cig will be even harder than my previous attempts with real cigarettes. Maybe I will have to start over again and go cold turkey some time in the future. I've decided to worry about that when I get there, and enjoy my quit now for what it is. Maybe I'm prolonging things, but for now I'm 2 days without smoking cigarettes and I feel pretty good.

Thanks for reading this.

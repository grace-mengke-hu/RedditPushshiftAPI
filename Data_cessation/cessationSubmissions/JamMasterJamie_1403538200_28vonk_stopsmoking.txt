Day One - Stress Relieving Rant

Long time lurker, first time poster...

I've been smoking for about 25 years.  I just turned 40, so you can do the math - I have been smoking for far too long, roughly a pack a day. I really want one right now (I've been just over 12 hours without), so I decided to post here until the craving passes, as well as for whatever support might come my way.

I have quit twice before, both time for five months.  Once, back in 1998, but I went on a cross-country road-trip with a smoker, so I ended up falling off the wagon.  Second time was about six years ago, but I started again because they eliminated breaks at my job and it was the only way to get away from my desk until I finally quit and found a better job.

So, here I am, going again.  No gum, no e-cigarettes, no patches.  Cold turkey.  When I've tried stopping with supplements, I find that I'm really just moving the addiction, not beating it, so like the two previous times when I've successfully (for a time) quit in the past, I am just doing it.  I know it's going to be a long, hard week, but I also know that it will get better.

The sad part is that I'm not quitting because I'm sick of smoking, I'm not quitting for my health, I'm not quitting because my loved ones want me to.  I am quitting for the sole stupid reason of being a cheap bastard.  I worked out that I'm basically paying $0.50 per cigarette, and fuck that action! I ought to become a pothead instead - Illegal marijuana is cheaper than legal nicotine.  Makes no sense that a legal drug is more expensive than an illegal one, so I'm quitting, and I'm going to save a ton of money and then go on vacation.

Day one - Here we come!  Thanks for letting me rant - I feel better already.

So much for Allen Carr :'(

I was fine all day until everyone went to bed. Since then I've been continually upset and stressed despite trying my best to distract myself. 

I'm supposed to be enjoying this and I'm not. I know I've done it wrong somewhere.

I wanted to do this to feel less shit and now I feel awful :'(

Edit: Thank you for your kind words every one. I've resorted to the e-cigarette because I couldn't deal with the withdrawal. I know it makes me weak in the eyes of a few people, but it beats breathing in actual smoke.

Good luck to everyone else though! Stay strong :)

Would you call this a craving?

I am now nearly a week free. I do not suffer too much from cravings. But I remember that, even after a long time smoke free, I still had the odd cigarette thought. It would not be a strong feeling, it would be the same way you feel like having a steak or some chocolate. Would you still call that a craving?

Smoked 1 cigaret after 2 weeks.

So I was in the habit of smoking 1 cigaret before going to bed. I did this for many year. I quit 2 weeks ago and posted here http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/201yw7/i_only_smokeed_a_maximum_of_2_cigarets_a_night/         
Although quitting was not too hard for me, last night I gave in and bummed one from a friend to take it home. I smoked it right before I went to bed. I am feeling a little guilty and want to share. Do I reset my counter?

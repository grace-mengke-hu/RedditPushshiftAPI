Almost Day 20!

Day 19 here and it was a feeling of "this is so stupid" plus plain vanity that's egged me on to this quit this time. I've quit many times before, never succeeded because the cravings were always greater than my will. Smoked for 10 years. 

Cravings still around sometimes, caved a puff or two on a night out but they weren't as bad as previous quits. I daresay this is even easy. I hope it stays that way.

I learned a lot from my previous quits. I scheduled my quit on a bloc of vacation days (4 days when I could be home alone), because the first few days have always been the roughest. I slept through most of those days. Persistent brain fog was always what frustrated me into a relapse, so this time I took it as easy as possible at work (it was difficult, still. Even reading a text or replying was difficult at day 5.)

Now food tastes more intense and my breath and fingers and clothes smell amazing and hopefully my skin is on its way to glowing (does it ever recover though??). I also run and now my legs get tired faster than my lungs do. It's crazy how that hasn't happened to me in a while!

Hang in there, folks!! We can do this!

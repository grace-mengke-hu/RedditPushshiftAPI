Keeping that daily savings jar

On day 5 and already fascinated. Like many people I set up a piggy bank and plan on putting my daily cigarette budget inside. 

I find it really interesting how I have to go out of my way to make it to the piggyback at the end of the day. I'm already sort of cheating by putting in 2 days worth at once (since that's a bill). I had to go to the post office to withdraw cash already, and actually withdrew thinking about the piggy bank, contemplating putting in everything at once so I won't have to think about the money for the rest of the week. 

 I *never* had to think of it like that for cigarettes since I just bought it whenever I had run out. It really puts things in perspective for me, about how easy it is to spend mindlessly as opposed to planning out your finances like an adult.

I want to quit.

Okay so I'm 19, I've been smoking for like 5-6 years but nothing too serious until college (3 years ago) both my parents are long term smokers and have obviously gone on and on about the negatives etc etc. I've done stints not smoking (the longest was 2 months) but as I'm currently at uni I've just been doing it as a time waster. I know I'm now pretty much 100% addicted as i cant kid myself anymore. Browsing this reddit i see people talking about how they were slaves to nicotine. Part of me wants to quit but part of me kind of doesn't care. I don't know what the point of this post was, maybe just some advice on quitting and motivation?

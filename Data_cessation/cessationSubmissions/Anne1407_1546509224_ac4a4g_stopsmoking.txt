I failed but starting over

I was here a long time ago. I failed, I started smoking again. It cost me a lot, fights, lies, a lot.  
But yesterday at 22pm, I smoked my last cigarette. I have a patch applied, I have downloaded an app, I am going to kick that bloody addiction for real this time. It's over!

My trick

Hey,

So I'm writing to all of you from the UK where smoking is stupidly expensive. We are talking £10-£12 for a pack of 20 cigarettes (assuming you buy a decent brand; that comes out at $13-15 USD). This is the first meaningful attempt I have made to stop smoking and I am going strong at about 10 days. I was never the worlds biggest smoker, probably averaging about 8-10 a day. In some ways I guess that means quitting will be easier for me than for others, but damn if I'm not going through some serious withdrawal right now.

Today, I had some seriously bad cravings, but instead of caving and buying a pack, I bought something of equivalent value. One of the big attractions of quitting is the money saved, but I figure that to begin with, substituting cigarettes with buying something else still gives me a small dopamine hit, as well as a physical object to distract myself with. Eventually, when my cravings subside, I guess I'll be able to stop buying treats. But until then, it's a great distraction from my cravings. Today I bought a nice moleskin journal. Last week, I bought a Casio watch...because 20 years later I still think they're cool. When I get cravings I can also look at these things and think "do I want to burn this?", because that's essentially what smoking is. Burning money. Burning the opportunity to buy something nice and lasting.

Anyway, that's my trick. If I stay on the quitting train, a couple of times a week I get to buy myself a treat. It's working so far! Good luck to all of you :)

I'm getting there, not one puff since Sunday!

It's working, will power, and cold-turkey. Along with help from reddit as well as exercise and proper diet i've never felt better in my life. Guys I'm a frat boy who loved his cigs and partying but if I can make the change so can you, so get to it and take back YOUR life.

EDIT: Thanks everyone for the support so far and best of luck in you endeavours! Feel free to inbox me anytime if you feel like caving we can talk through this.

18 year old college student stopping after 2.5 years

I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life but when I was around 16 vaping became the thing at my high school. I initially avoided it but when my best friends started doing it I bought a mod to be a “cool kid”. The local shop never ID’d so it wasn’t hard at all to keep my addiction. 

Flash forward to college, yesterday, and I’m having a rough day so I start vaping in my dorm room at 1 in the morning. I set off the smoke alarm and wake up everyone on the floor. I clear out the room so no smoke and I tell the RA “it just went off” and I think he believed me. Regardless, finals are next week and everyone is pissed. This is my wake up call I have a problem and I need to stop. Smoking has taken what little time, energy, and money I have. I’m quitting today.

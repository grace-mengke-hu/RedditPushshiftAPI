Discovering this Subreddit was the last push I needed to quit!

Here we go. Third attempt in the last 6 months. Hopefully this one will stick. I've been smoking since I was 17. Never really considered quitting until I started noticing spots on my teeth (which really grossed me out) I'm 21 and I have a long road ahead of me with my teeth. So that was the final nail in the coffin. but I kept coming back and getting weak. A bad day at work. Anxiety flaring up. a night out drinking with friends. Kept pulling me back. But enough is enough. I haven't even finished my last pack. I bought it last night but I don't care. I'm done...

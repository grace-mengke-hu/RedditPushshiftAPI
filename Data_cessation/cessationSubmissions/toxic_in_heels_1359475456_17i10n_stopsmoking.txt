The smoking dreams need to stop!

Ok seriously! I woke up this morning in a panic thinking I caved last night and would have to come clean to you all.......then I realized that it was a dream. Son of a bitch! The smoking dreams really show just how ingrained the addiction goes. Plus it's been a whole month free for me! Yay!

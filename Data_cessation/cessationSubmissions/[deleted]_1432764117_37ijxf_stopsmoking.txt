The Quit Smoking App game I play with myself.

I quit smoking and my first move is to hit Quit Now on the app I have downloaded so I can watch the money saved and time quit grow. Then a day later after I've finished the pack I bought I hit Quit Now and start again. It's like a joke at this point. I must've reset that app 20 times this month. Anyone else do this?  Just shows my complete lack of commitment. 

Oh yeah. Ignore my days quit next to my username cause that shit ain't accurate.

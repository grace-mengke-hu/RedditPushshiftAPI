Checking in for almost 40 days, but i need a lill help

i cant stop eating! or more to the real issue, i haven't found a better way to "replace" the smoke break, its now become a "shove something in my gob that's tasty" break  
i knew when i was gonna quit that the hardest this was letting go of that 5 minutes break, outside taking a head rest from being a housewife/mother ect   
i need to give myself some kind of little "break" or "reward" thats not going to result in massive weight gain/cost the earth/or damage my health, and that will also fit into my 10 month old sons life.  
all i have right now is the cupboard with the treats, and thats what im doing now, i really do not want this to carry on  
i will not smoke again, but i need something to help me during the day, and right now its food....and no a bloody carrot or celery stick wont cut it

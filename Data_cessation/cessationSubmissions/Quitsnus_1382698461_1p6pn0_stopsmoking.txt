Quitting snus

Been really trying for a while to quit snus. For those that don't know snus is a smokefree tobbaco thats really popular especially in Scandinavia. 

I managed to quit for a week, but I went out and bought a new box yesterday. 

I really don't want to go through the physical abstinences again, but my real problem lies in the tought of "Now would be a great time for snus." Anyone got any tips for how to counteract these toughts? Or things I can do every time this comes up?

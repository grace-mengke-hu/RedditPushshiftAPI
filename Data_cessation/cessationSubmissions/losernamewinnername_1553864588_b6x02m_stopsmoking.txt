Quitting while working?

I got saturdays and sundays free, work ain't too hard but if I don't want to bring some weed barely anyone comes to play basketball or hang out with me though these friendships don't really make me happy because they are fake as fuck, just spending time not socializing after work or doing anything is what makes me disappointed. And somehow I manage to quit cigs but I always relapse on weed (everyone does it with tobacco here), maybe because I just can't socialize if it's not weed or basketball. I'm afraid of quitting cigs because I'll just crave weed, then a spliff.  But even smoking weed makes me incredibly lethargic and my sinuses are making this squeaking noise. I really don't know. I feel like I'm stuck in a cycle and there is no way out, don't have time to feel depressed about it but this city just gets on my nerves. Deleted fb because all my communications are about drugs or people offering me weed or harder stuff or asking me if I have some...  I don't remember when somebody called me to go out just for the sake of hanging out and not needing anything from me.. Wtf. I had one best friend in past who moved to Germany, we did shit together high or sober, but he got into meth and went to German... It's ironic that he quit using dope and went 10x times to hospital in 2018 and he still claims our 550ug "acid" trip was the worst experience that happened to him and was also to me. How the fuck I find a friend whom with I wont end up in hell or some fucker who complains about every single shit while he's got things in abundance. Lol

5*5*5: An honest look at what to expect if you quit smoking for 125 days.

This is a list of truths and lies I have had to deal with. 

**1) "Smoking makes you cool."**  Smoking mitigates emotions.  Smoking make the highs less high, the lows less low.  It smooths everything out.  It works like dopamine on my pleasure receptors.  That's why it feels good.  It's not the smoke, not the flavor, not the light-headedness, none of these lies.  It's the nicotine, pure and simple.  It saturates the receptors that would normally be dealing with feelings, it disaffects me slightly, and literally makes me cool.  It makes me emotionally cool, and it reduces my circulation, making my skin cool.  Smoking makes me not feel.  Think about that.  Quitting smoking is a decision to begin feeling things.  Most people learn how to feel things as teens.  Do you remember what teenage emotions were like?  Ha, yeah.  This is like that.

**2) "I can have just one."**  I can restart my addiction any time.  Literally any time.  One or two puffs will [resaturate 50% of my nicotine receptors.  Finishing a smoke will get me close to 90%.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16894067)   So all I need to get fully physically re-addicted is one cigarette. 

**3) "It will be over in three days."**  After about three days, the receptors mentioned above will pretty much have cleared.  It sucks real bad while this is happening.  After all, this is why I smoked in the first place.  By day three, the one billion tiny fishhooks attached to every cell in my body will finally have yanked out most of the nicotine.  

But lurking in the shadows... my liver hates me.  All the time I smoked, it was saving up partially metabolized nicotine, in various forms.  And now this has to leave the system.  Different people experience this in different ways.  For me it feels like that one puff mentioned in #2.  It's not enough to satisfy a craving, it's just enough to *create* a craving.  This takes a lot of people by surprise.  A lot of people relapse at around a month or two, when the final dredges of [metabolized nicotine compounds](http://pharmrev.aspetjournals.org/content/57/1/79/F7.expansion.html) are [leaving their system.](http://pharmrev.aspetjournals.org/content/57/1/79.full)  That last link is extremely long & sciency, and all of us in /r/stopsmoking would benefit from more interpretations besides mine.  

**3a) "This sucks, it will never be over."**  Quitting isn't a thing with an end.  Not smoking forever is a decision you make once.  You know in your heart if you have made this decision.  It is not an easy thing to find.  It sometimes takes many attempts.  And fair warning, when you find it, it will not be alone.  There will be... other aspects of your life that you will want to change.  Smoking was and is and will forever be a lie, but it is a lie that covers for the other lies we tell ourselves.  Quitting nicotine will give you an uncomfortably detailed level of self knowledge.  When this comes too quickly, it can be accompanied by an equal amount of self loathing.  This passes, be patient.   [I'm not sure how regular people live this way, but will let you know when I figure it out.  I believe it has to do with processing feelings and allowing for personal growth in a prompt and honest way.  Ugh.]

**4) "The cravings will get better."**  And worse.  And better.  And worse again.  And better again.  If you could take [this curve](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/DampedSine.png/350px-DampedSine.png) and add some random spikes here and there, you'll have a pretty good feeling for how it's going to feel.  Sure the cravings become more infrequent, more manageable.  But then when they DO hit, it is even more surprising.  I expect to go an actual whole year before sorting out all the triggers.  Several years to reprogram them all.  An entire lifetime to live.  Will I feel this way forever?  Even if I do, this is the right choice.  This is still better than smoking.

**5) "Nicotine is a mind-altering drug."**  Be careful who you believe when dealing with substances of this nature.  Your brain will literally lie to your very face to try to get you to smoke.  It will tell you straight up that smoking will make you feel better, when we know it will only restart your jones for more smoking.  Do not trust your brain.

**6) "Cold turkey is too hard."**  Do you get more wet swimming in an ocean or a lake?  Every single cigarette fully resets your physical addiction. Everyone who quits successfully eventually does it the same way.  They stop ingesting nicotine.

I am a person.  I will not be a slave.  Today I am free.  125 days ago I decided to be free forever.

Edit: Thank you for the gold.  I am addressing myself in the words I wrote, and I'm glad to find I'm not alone in these experiences, and that people find this useful.

Does anyone else feel extremely warm, especially at night after quitting.

I feel like I’m always warm. Especially at night, even with the fan on and the temp at 68, I still feel like I’m in a sauna. I went through an odd phase where stopped smoking for almost 6 years, then went through a really rough patch, started again, now I can smoke for weeks, stop for about two weeks then start again. So I go through this every few weeks. Yes, I know sounds pretty insane, but I’m really trying this time. I really want to quit, but it’s so easy to go buy a pack, plus I’m indoors a lot in a city where it sunny all year round so I use the excuse that it get me outside for a few minutes.

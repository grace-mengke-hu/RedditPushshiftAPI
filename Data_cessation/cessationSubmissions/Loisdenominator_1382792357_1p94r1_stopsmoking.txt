First time air travel since quitting

I feel a itty bitty tinsy winsy urge. This is where I would be smoking like a mad woman, in between packing and trying not to forget important things, like passport and ticket.

I would also be worrying that I'd have to get to the airport on time so I could have a pre-security screening smoke. Then I'd be worrying about if they were going to take away my lighter. I once spent 45 minutes at LGA looking for lighters and/or smokers. Oh yes, then the worry about being able to find a place and time to smoke on the layover without missing the connecting flight.

Ahhhhhh, urge crushed. It feels good to be free.

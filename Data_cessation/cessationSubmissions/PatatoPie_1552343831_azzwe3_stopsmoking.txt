I need advice

Im an underaged smoker. Ever since highschool started i have been a heavy smoker since there is a lot of students who also smoke and i have made friends with some of them. I have been caught by my parents many times and tried to quit but i could only last a week without smoking. My parents try to stop me from smoking by punishing me (such as not giving my allowance and not letting me gooutside except for school) which is a pretty normal reaction. I know it will ruin my life and started ruining it step by step but i really didnt care about it that much until know. I have just been caught by my mother while smoking (Its around 2 pm and i was studying for an exam) and i felt that she gave up on the idea of me stopping smoking (She still took my pack and money though). She didnt shout at me or anything most probably because its exam week and also very late at night but i finnaly understood that i should finnaly stop smoking. Im only looking for advice about what to do when i really feel the urge to smoke.

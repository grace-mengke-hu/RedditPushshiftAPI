Useful graphics, sites?

Trying to quit again. One thing that really helped me last time (got to 3 months) was that whenever I had a craving I would religiously read how symptoms and experiences were coming and passing. Dunno, why, but that sense of control was pretty therapeutic. Is there anything you guys tend to reference in the same way? Here is an example: http://whyquit.com/whyquit/a_benefits_time_table.html

And, thanks even if you are just reading.

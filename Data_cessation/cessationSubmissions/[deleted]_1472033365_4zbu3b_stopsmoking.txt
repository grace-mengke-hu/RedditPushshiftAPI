3rd day check in..

I have tried to quit before, usually the second and third days are the worst and I used to yield back to the habit. But this time it feels okay and the other two days I have been consuming green tea. It is helping a lot and now subscribed to this sub and got the badge. I have also started exercising . Just need your help and support guys, I really want to kick this shit out of my system

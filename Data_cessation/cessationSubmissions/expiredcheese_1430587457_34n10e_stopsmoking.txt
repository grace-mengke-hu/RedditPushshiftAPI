Day 2, it hurts

I'm almost 2 days into quitting. In a few hours it'll be 48 hours without a smoke.

I've smoked since i was 15, at about a pack or so a day since age 18. So I've been smoking about 17 years.

I've never once tried to quit.

I'm trying cold turkey first. So far two days in and the urges are everywhere. Driving sucks. Work is outside and everyone smokes, so that sucks.

I feel like I'm in physical pain every minute of the day and I'm really pissy mood. 

This gets easier right? I don't want to vape. I can't afford patches. I'm just going to kick this habit cold turkey.

I'm not a strong person though.

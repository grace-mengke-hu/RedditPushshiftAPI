Confused by my actions...

I have been 39 days sober of any nicotine product until today.. I have respected this subreddit and its commentators for a long time. I quit cold turkey on December 10, 2013 and ended my cigarette love. I was a smoker since 18 with my first cigarette involving unfiltered Camel stoges. Panama City beach Spring Break completely ignorant of cigarettes and Camels tasted amazing. Anyway I have been putting off my self post before I had some quitting time behind me. I wanted to have a body clean of nicotine before I posted on this subreddit. Now I feel I have failed my quest of sobriety by trying my friends wax vaporizer filled with another ingredient. The vaporizer contained some nicotine concentrate but mostly bud. I feel my days clean of nicotine mean no more. I quit because I don't want my money going to millionaires salaries. The idea that CEO's would rather see my loss of health over a penny is disgusting. I just want the communities take on naivety and how I should look at always being consistent with quitting nicotine.

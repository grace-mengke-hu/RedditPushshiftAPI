Help! I haven't had a cigarette since new year's eve, and now I can't stop eating.

I'm very proud of how far I've come. However, and I know this sounds really fucking stupid, but I'd rather smoke and be unhealthy on the inside than gain weight and look unhealthy on the outside, which is making really want to take up smoking again. Someone said today that I've gained weight and it hit me hard as I've only not been smoking eleven days; however when I thought about it I realised I'm hungry more often than usual and find myself eating snacks at midnight and having large lunches etc. has anyone had any experience with this or have any advice? I read online that everyone gains weight when quitting. How easy will it be to lose this weight and is it easy to keep it at bay by just exercising and eating healthily? Any input would be great.

TL;DR, eleven days without a cigarette, appetite has ballooned and I've gotten a bit fat

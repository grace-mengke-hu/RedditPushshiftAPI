2 weeks and feeling great!

I've been lurking around here, trying to gain the courage to stop smoking. Well today is 2 weeks of being smoke free and I feel great! I didn't even really know how bad/much smoking was effecting my body, mind and just overall disposition. I feel like a new person. 

I just wanted to say Thank You to everyone in this sub! I've comb through posts after posts, and seeing everyone's journey has really motivated and inspired me. For me the hardest part was fear. Fear of not knowing how I would react, or fear of never smoking again \(seems like such a silly fear now\), fear of the unknown. But seeing so many of you guys step into the unknown and not only surviving but thriving and coming out the other side a much healthier and happier,  has changed my mind set and help quell that fear. 

Thank you! I know we can all live happily as non smokers

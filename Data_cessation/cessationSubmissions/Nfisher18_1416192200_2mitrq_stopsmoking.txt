AM I STILL CONSIDERED A QUITTER?? is this cheating?

I have smoked for about 16 years minimum half pack a day. I have tried multiple ways to quit from the patch, to e-cig, to hypnosis and nothing sticks. The hypnosis was the best - went about 2 months until one night heading to an outside party I caved and bought a pack and that was it. I eventually creeped my way back into my normal smoking pattern. That was in June. On Monday, I decided to just try it cold turkey and using the "SmokeFree" app again. I am excited to say that THIS time around for some reason, the cravings aren't as strong - but here's my question...Am I really a "quitter". I have smoked a total of 4 cigarettes this week...where if I was still doing my normal habits I would be on my fourth PACK! I feel like it's not really cheating but I don't know if I'm just an addict trying to justify it. Like all of you, I LOVE smoking, but I know I need to stop - but I still pat myself on the back for only smoking 4...do I deserve it?

Finally quitting. 2 1/2 days in..

I'm 28 and have been smoking since I was 12. Been lurking here for a couple years,  and recently something clicked and just said no. I have a lot of people's support which is helping a lot, and i feel blessed that right now this all seems so easy. I've always known the dangers and patterns, but it's like I woke up and could clearly see what i needed to do. Thank you and good luck to all who frequent this sub. 

All day Day 2 I haven't had one craving!

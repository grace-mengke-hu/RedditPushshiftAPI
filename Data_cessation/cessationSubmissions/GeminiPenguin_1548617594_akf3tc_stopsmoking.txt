Was tempted but didn’t give in

I’m just a few hours shy of my official two week mark. I had to go to the grocery store today and I’ve been avoiding public places as much as I can. So I popped in a gum before I got outta the truck and then had to walk by a smoker smoking. I know a lot of smokers claim it stinks but it smelled good to me. Maybe it won’t forever but it did today. It’s the first time I’ve had to smell it since I quit smoking. I shopped and left the store without buying any smokes. The smoker was still outside and he was hacking up a lung. I get bad for him. I’m so glad I was able to make it out of the store without giving in. Now I’m home for the day and binge some Netflix and look forward to not hacking every winter.

Tomorrow is the big day (again)

Tomorrow I am going to try to quit smoking (again). I downloaded the Smoke Free app and I have a box of nicotine gum. I am really nervous. Do you guys have any tips or advice? I tend to swing between super emotional and completely mean and uncaring. I wake up in the middle of the night sweating and I eat way too fucking much. How do I cope with this?

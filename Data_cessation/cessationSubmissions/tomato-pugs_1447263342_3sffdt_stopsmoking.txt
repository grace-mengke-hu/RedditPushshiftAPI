Day two

Day two of quitting smoking..
it has definitely been hard adjusting to the mindset of not having a smoke.. i bought some rollable herbal cigarettes inc ase the cravings got too intense. they are definitely disgusting..and help with quitting (as i've tried before).. yet it is still a definite challenge..dealing with the emotions that come along..that are usually drowned and dismissed with a light of a cig. 

I'm hoping i can learn to cope with these emotions and not use a cig to dismiss them..

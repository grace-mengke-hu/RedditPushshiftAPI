How did you start?

I have stopped smoking a few times thanks to nicotine gum, and want to give it another go. Somehow I always wound up back smoking. I think my longest away from it was 6 months, although I was 24 then and 30 now. I think I might be able to stop forever if I could replicate that. But I have not had too much success with the gum lately, it is basically chew. Anyways, thanks for your input everybody and keep it up.

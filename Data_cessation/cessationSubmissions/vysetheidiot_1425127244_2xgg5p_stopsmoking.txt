Fucking agitation

Long story short I'm quitting again after a relatively short relapse (1 month a pack a day) and while it's been about a month jesus Christ the fucking agitation is killing me. 

I hate everyone around me. Every noise pisses me off. It's not conversations. I'll be with my girlfriend and we're having a great conversation I'm enjoying it etc and I just can't stand the sound of her voice. 

Same with my friends. Movies too. Watching Harry Potter and someone was stirring a drink. I almost went mad. 

Do you guys get this? It's been so long.. Normal I don't get side effects this long after quitting (usually a week max) it's really starting to have an effect on my personal life.

Ideas? I just had to share.

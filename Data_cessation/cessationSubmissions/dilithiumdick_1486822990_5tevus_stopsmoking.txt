30 days in and feeling good! But i bit off more than i could chew.

The last 10 years of my life has been constant drinking, smoking a pack a day, weed, etc. Needless to say, i was pretty disappointed with my situation. So decided to make a change from the beginning of this year. I quit drinking, smoking and weed. Plus i started cold showers and nofap after going through the subreddits. Its been hard. I threw myself into a set routine and joined a gym. I am happy to say that i have been successful with not smoking so far. And now i am addicted to cold showers. But i slipped on drinking last week and drank 3 days straight. I also had convinced myself that it will be my real test of not smoking. I did have strong urges to smoke but i stayed strong. Nofap didn't work out either. 
I just wanna know if anyone has any experience similar to this. Maybe it's not possible to tackle everything at the same time. But i am scared to slip back into the old routine if i keep drinking. 
But i am so happy being smoke free for 30 days and i couldn't have done it without this subreddit :)

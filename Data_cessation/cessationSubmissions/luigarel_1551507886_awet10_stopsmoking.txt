Smoking dreams 😅

Hi everyone! As the title says, I’m having smoking dreams every night! I quitted cold turkey and to be honest I’m pretty good now, only have minor cravings 2/3 times a day, buuut, “the night is dark and full of terrors”, and I keep dreaming that I smoke and waking up every 2 hours...

Just needed to share it 😅 good luck to everyone!! We can do it 💪🏻💪🏻

Checking In after 6 months

Well my 6 month milestone was a little while ago, I kept meaning to check in but forgot, better late than never.

Oddly I consider stopping smoking to simultaneously be the hardest thing I have ever done, and in hindsight, a lot easier than I expected.

I still remember those first few days, around day 3 thing started to get a bit easier, I wasn't thinking about smoking constantly any more.  I just had to fend of the cravings.  From there on it's a very winnable battle.

I still had ups and downs, I had a lot of interrupted sleep for the first month.

As I have said previously, doing things for the first time since you stopped will remind you of smoking and probably bring on a craving.  The more you do these things without smoking the less potent these cravings will be.

If you can, make some kind of lifestyle change, big or small it doesn't matter, just something new that won't remind you of your past routines and smoking.

This sub really helped me keep focussed, thanks everybody.

It’s been a journey!

I’ve learned so much I’m smoke free for 4months 20days and it feels like a lifetime that I haven’t smoked and I feel great! I’m feeling grateful,  but I’ve learned a lot about myself my positives n negatives since not smoking. I’m forever vigilant but I can honestly feel that I will never smoke cigarettes again just because it took so many years n physical and mental pain to get these 5months I mean a real test! Not another puff ever again! Thank u community

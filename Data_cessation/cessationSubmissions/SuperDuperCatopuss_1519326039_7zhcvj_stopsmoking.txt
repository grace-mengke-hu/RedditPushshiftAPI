Back on board after bailing for 4 months

Howdy folks.

Back on July 24th, 2017 I began what became a 3 month long quitting streak, cold turkey. It was really rough, but I was proud of myself.

In late October of 2017, I partied and drank for the first time since quitting. I still went all night without smoking, which surprised drunk me very much. Waking up the next morning, I wasn't even hung over, everything was fine. I left and stopped for a coffee along the way. I also picked up a pack of smokes, hardly thinking twice about it. Thus ended my quit for another 4 months. I was so embarrassed and ashamed of myself that I deleted the inspired posts I made on this subreddit during my quit.

I started Zyban a couple weeks back and, as of February 17th of 2018, I am smoke free again! I was sort of wary of Zyban, I'm sure you've heard the horror stories. I was prepared for the worst, and have happily been treated to the very best instead!

It's sort of like a switch flipped in my head. My body craves a cigarette sometimes, I can tell by the way my chest tightens up and my stomach turns. The nice thing is that it doesn't really register in my head, and I haven't mentally "nicced out" once in these 5 days, though I think I have been just slightly more irritable. I feel a bit like I'm cheating because it's nearly too easy, but I'll still take too easy over smoking again any day!

I was smoking a pack a day for nearly 6 years. If I can do this, you can do this. We can all do this! Thanks to all who post and comment on this sub, reading through your stories and advice every day makes this experience that much better. 

If anybody has questions about how Zyban is treating me and what you might expect when taking it, I'll do my very best to answer!

TIL it takes ~4 months to get over it.

Well, not completely. But I'm a lot let pissier than I was last month. 

Watching someone smoke doesn't give me as strong an urge like it used to. 

I'm no longer dreaming about trying to get a smoke. (ever get those dreams when you're just roaming around trying to find a smoke, and not finding anything, or when you finally get a hold of it you're not being able to light up.. like a nightmare but not really scary, just a "tease"mare)

I think about putting one to my mouth, and while earlier I would get a semi, now I'm like "naah. i'm good"

I finally feel like I can quit now. I mean really quit for good. All this time (4 months) I was just counting the days I could go on without. Only now I've started to gain confidence that I can actually go forever!

Although I'm a little scared of my own overconfidence. I've a history of slipping up while I was ahead. I hope I don't let that happen.

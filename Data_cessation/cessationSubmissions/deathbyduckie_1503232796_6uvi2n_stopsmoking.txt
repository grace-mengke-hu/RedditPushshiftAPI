Day 4 with just vaping

I've been vaping and smoking together for about 8 weeks and have finally cut it down to just a vape. First two days were fine but I've been having a few cravings that my e cig doesn't completely cut out today and yesterday. Doesn't help being around friends who do smoke but I'm determined to do this. I've already dropped from 12mg to 6mg with a new mod I treated myself to. I just want to get to a week and then I know I'll be alright!

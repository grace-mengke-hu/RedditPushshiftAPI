Four months!

Four months clean of all nicotine! General snus and Njoy e-cigs were my poison. The empowerment you get from quitting (and once you get bored of being 'quit') helped me make a lot of other healthy lifestyle changes. I eat healthy and exercise regularly now and feel so much better. I've tried to quit dozens of times with everything. This time it was just cold turkey and perseverance. I'm at the point where I don't think about it anymore. I'll always be on my toes in case anymore phantom cravings pop up. No more headaches, malaise, pounding heart, high blood pressure, etc... My heart rate has come down to low 60s, blood pressure is fantastic, and my anxiety has almost disappeared. There really is light at the end of the tunnel and it doesn't seem like it, but it really is worth it.

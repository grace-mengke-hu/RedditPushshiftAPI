9 days in.

Hey everyone. I'm 9 days into my quit and I have to say it's been crazy. The first week was insane.

I had smoked for 7 years and around 25 cigarettes a day. That's almost 2 cigs for every hour I was awake.

However after a week the cravings are less intense, and I worry more about resetting the clock if I have Nicorette or a smoke.

I still havnt gone through any miracle healing though, my sense of smell is a little less shit, but still shit. My chest doesn't feel clearer(never really felt bad except for the mornings) although I don't cough up lung butter in the morning, yay!
When did you guys start to really notice changes? And what were they?

Anyways, things are going well, and it's not as bad as I thought it would be to quit. I've taken up eating to help with cravings, and I work out a lot more with help from /r/gainit
I wish the best for everyone else.

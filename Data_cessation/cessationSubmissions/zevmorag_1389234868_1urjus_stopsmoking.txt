Dealing With Anxiety

Hi all. Trying to stop smoking. Today is day 1. Started out really well. However, life happens and sometimes it can really get you down. Today is not a great day, and all I can think about is lighting up one. I know it won't make me feel better but this urge is killing me. How do you deal with this kind of moments?

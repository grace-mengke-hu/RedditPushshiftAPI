3 Weeks Cigarette Free

I would like to thank everyone here for the support that you give to each other, whether it is someone struggling to get past that craving monster within them or someone that has been smoke free for years..  Each post to me is very helpful! I smoked 40+ years and had resigned myself to the fact that I would never be able to stop. With the support of this group, the smoke free app and NRT for the first few days, I have surprised myself. Ohh there are still times that the monster inside is fighting for his spot back, but with the health benefits that I have already noticed, let alone the social, financial and freedom from the need to plan keeping that addiction feed and the fact that I don't stink anymore I'm going to commit no smoking today, each day for the rest of my life! 
Thanks again all and best of luck with your quit,  if I can do it, so can you!! Hope you all have a Fabulous DayðŸ˜Š

Two Years and... not really counting...

Like many others, somewhere around 100 days the interest in counting or keeping track of the day count fell off precipitously.

Probably the greatest result of my having quit is the impact it's had on others, most notably my SO. [Here's a link to a post I made at day 80](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/slbuy/around_the_smoke_free_world_in_80_days/) where I mentioned my SO as a smoker. I'm happy to report that they will be celebrating 300 days smoke free this coming Sunday!

Never underestimate the positive impact your decisions (and demonstration of strength) can have on others.

Stay strong fellow former smokers!

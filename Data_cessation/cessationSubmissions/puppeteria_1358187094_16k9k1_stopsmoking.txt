1 year TODAY! Incredible feeling, thank you /r/StopSmoking!!

It has been 1 year as of today since I have had a cigarette. I now consider myself a "non-smoker" in all senses of the word. Thank you /r/StopSmoking for giving me tips, providing me with feedback, and encouragement. Feels good...

I used Chantix for 1 week, then quit 365 days ago.

BONUS: Fiance quit 1 year ago today as well, we are both champions!

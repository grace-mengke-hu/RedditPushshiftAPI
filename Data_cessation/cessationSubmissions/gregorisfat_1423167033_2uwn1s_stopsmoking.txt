Hey guys, checking in on day ten, with some tips

So it's been ten days now, and I go hours and hours not even thinking about smoking. It's an amazing feeling. And when I do think about it, it's not in the form of a craving anymore.

I think one thing really helped. 

1) I no longer obsess over my nicotine cessation. I've moved on to trying to "quit" other things, which are taking up my mental real estate. I've started working out daily, eating at a big caloric deficit, and not drinking at night (I am pretty much a 2-3 per night kinda guy), which now seem way harder than quitting smoking. 

Now all I can think about is losing weight (I'm stopping drinking temporarily more as an avenue to weight loss, though I am aware that drinking nightly is excessive). 

Hopefully the quitting smoking bogeyman doesn't get me and I can actually DROP some pounds rather than add them.

So my advice is: get obsessed with some other difficult task! Smoking will quickly become an afterthought.

Best of luck to all of you out there!

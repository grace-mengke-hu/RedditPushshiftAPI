Nicotine by Gregor Hens

Long time lurker here, been lurking a lot more recently since I and gearing up for my quit asap. Wondering if anyone has read Nicotine by Gregor Hens. I want to start reading now that I can stay focused (used to fall asleep every time I tried to read after I had my kids, but they're older now and I find myself more able to stay alert during downtime). 

My question is: do you think it's something better to read before quitting? Like, am I going to feel like I miss them more if I start it after? I struggle with depression quite a bit when I quit and am going to try a more positive outlook this time around, but read reviews that he talks of some of his best times in life being when he smoked and the last thing I need is to have something pulling my thoughts back into a negative space.

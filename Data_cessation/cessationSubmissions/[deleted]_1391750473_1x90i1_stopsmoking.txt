In Las Vegas, need some advice...

I'm over 200 days clean and quit a half pack a day habit using the easyway method.  I haven't had a single craving since day one. As I walk around Vegas, I'm tempted to get a decent cigar, not because of cravings, but because it seems like a fun thing to do. I wanted to get your collective opinions as this subreddit has helped me come so far and don't want to reset my badge. I can safely say that there is zero risk of me relapsing if I do decide to buy a cigar for one night. Thoughts?

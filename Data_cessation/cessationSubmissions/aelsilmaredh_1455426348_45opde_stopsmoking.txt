Having some trouble...

Well, I couldn't figure out how to reset my badge.  I smoked a few cigarettes between Feb. 5 and Feb. 7, and stopped for good on Feb. 7, so it's actually been 7 days according to my phone app.  I generally feel fine about it but tonight I feel that horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach.  I'm puffing my vape excessively.  How do I get through this?  What is so hard about not smoking a cigarette?

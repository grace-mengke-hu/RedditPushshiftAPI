Why haven't you read Allen Carr's book?

I've been reading posts oh this sub today, and honestly I'm not sure why. I actually started craving a cigarette reading some of the posts here. A lot of posters seem obsessed with how hard it is to quit, and that only breeds a negative mentality toward gaining a life free of nicotine. You didn't give up anything, you are gaining everything. You don't want to smoke, you want to enjoy life free of nicotine. If your mind is constantly telling you how hard it is to quit you NEED to read his book. I recommend the Quit Smoking Now version that comes with the hypnotherapy CD. You need to re-frame your mindset. You have been brainwashed with lies that smoking does something for you, it doesn't. Get the book, wash your brain with the truth. Quit believing it is sooo hard to quit, start believing you have a lot to gain by being nicotine free.

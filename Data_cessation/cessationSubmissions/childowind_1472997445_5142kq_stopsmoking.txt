Today will be my third day not smoking

and I think it might be getting a little easier?  It is definitely easier to breathe and I walked into my bedroom last night and was taken aback by how much it smelled of smoke.  I'm still having cravings, and I recognize my brain trying to trick me into buying cigarettes, but so far I've stayed strong and resolute.

I'm taking Wellbutrin but otherwise have gone cold turkey.  Things that have helped during a craving are:

* Sipping on cold water through a straw (this has been the major one)
* Munching on baby carrots and celery
* Brushing/flossing my teeth
* Downloading the MyQuitTime app and adding my own inspiration
* Reading Allan Carr's Easy Way to Quit Smoking which I found suggested to someone else in a thread on this subreddit yesterday. I'm hugely grateful for finding it, but I can't recall which thread it came from.  I devoured that book within a few hours.
* Not keeping any money or cards on me to buy cigarettes.  This has been the biggest barrier that has kept me from running to the gas station a couple of times.  I've set things up so that I would actually have to go to the bank to get cash out and then go buy cigs.  It being a holiday weekend here is physically restraining me from doing that.  I've kept away from people I could otherwise bum off of.
* Making note of my progress on facebook and being supported by friends and family.  It sounds silly but just watching the like counter go up on a status is hugely motivating.  I feel like I would be disappointing them if I faltered.

Anecdotal advice from friends who have quit is that the first three days are hell, but after that it becomes easier.  I'm hoping that's the case for me as well.  I had my last cigarette at 3:25 pm on Thursday so 3:25 pm today will be 72 hours smoke free.  Smoking has been really the only thing I've thought about for the last few days.  I really hope that I can get to a normal thought process soon and stop obsessing.  I try to focus on other things, but I do feel kind of brain dead and distracted.  This has been one of the biggest hurdles for me.

If anyone has any other advice on keeping distracted or working through a craving, I would really love to hear it.

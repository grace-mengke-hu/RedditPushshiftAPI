265 days since I decided to no longer be a slave to cigarettes. 100 days more and it will be a year. Yes!

This has been the best 8 months of my life! I'm no longer in a toxic relationship, ditched my useless old "friends", and got rid of my terrible decade long habit. I am now in a healthy, happy relationship, I have TONS of new and amazing friends, I am drawing and painting more than I have ever before AND I'm going to be moving out of the midwest to the best coast this summer! I don't know how I have gotten so lucky but I am the happiest I have ever been! Quitting smoking was the first major change I made to improve my life and the good things just keep coming! I can't wait to see what else life is going to bring. 

If you are struggling with quitting, don't give in. Just keep it in your mind that you are no longer a smoker. You are not that person anymore. You are a strong, healthy individual who is capable of anything! Keep it up guys, you got this!

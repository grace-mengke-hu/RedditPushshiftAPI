What has the sub done to help you, and how can I let it help me?

I've been smoking for about 14 years. I've been able to feel what it's doing to my body for years, but I'm just now starting to get in the mindset that I have to quit now before it kills me.

So my question is, how do I utilize this sub to help me achieve this goal of quitting? How has it helped you?

Thanks in advance!

I slipped up

About two years ago I ended my smoking habit and felt great about it. I had smoked for over forty years but this time everything fell into place, I didn't want to smoke anymore, I was running and lifting weights and really didn't think that I would ever smoke again. I was proud and healthy and knew that I'd never be that smoker again. That is until about a week ago when I was taking part of a two week Muay Thai training training program in Thailand. For the first week or and a few days everything was fine, there were some people that smoked but like usual I didn't care and didn't have the urge to smoke. Then for some reason, I think it was because I was lonely, I decided to buy a pack of cigarettes and now I'm smoking regularly. 

It's been about five days now that I've been smoking like I used to and I'm getting worried that I won't be able to stop. Any words of wisdom how to get the 'strength' to not buy that next pack of cigarettes? My mind tells me just not to buy any more and throw away my lighter... but when I'm almost out of cigarettes, I walk into the nearest convenience store and buy more. Maybe when I'm back to my old schedule and not traveling it will be easier to quit again.

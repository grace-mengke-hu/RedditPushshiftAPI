How do you post a screenshot on here?

This may sound completely asinine. But everytime I try to upload a screenshot using the Reddit app, it refuses to acknowledge the image I chose from my library.  It doesn't even say, error or can't upload, it just acts like I never chose the image I wanted.  I'm using Samsung Galaxy S8, or Android.  I don't know if anyone else knows why it does this.

How do cravings and "cheating" work?

So you smoke which builds up dependencies, and get cravings when you don't have enough nicotine.

Then you quit, work through cravings by not smoking, and eventually they fade.

What is going on mentally/physically if say you go from smoking 10 a day, to none for a few days, to either one or none a day? Does it get easier to quit, or does the occasional breaking maintain mental connections and you're effectively sabotaging yourself?

Working on quitting, and in a perfect world you either stick to slowly cutting everything out, or quit cold turkey and stay vigilant. But in reality it's extremely hard to be "perfect" when quitting, and I want to understand how your body actually responds so I understand the impact.

I do understand that any single smoke from a former smoker can be step 1 in backsliding...definitely not suggesting the occasional "one off" is good behavior if your goal is quitting.

Not smoking has become easy...hence, much harder!

The first 5 days were pretty difficult.  Day 3 it could have gone either way honestly; I stopped at a gas station and bought 3 packs of gum instead of a pack of smokes (it was a close call), I almost left my 1st college class of the semester; I was a mess, yada yada it sucked and I almost smoked!  

But I made it 10 full days at this point and it's much easier.  I don't think about smoking for more than 20 or so seconds at a time. But now honestly it's hard but it in a much different way.  At first, I didn't truly want to smoke but I had cravings.  Now I am at the point where I feel myself wanting to smoke.  The cravings are gone/really weak.  Now i just want to smoke when...when I'm angry, after class, when I have a beer, always!  Its really weak now but it's so different!  Before I was motivated to beat the addiction and now I am like, eh I miss it.  

I'm not going to smoke anytime soon.  I still remember being addicted and having no choice and hating it.  But I am afraid that won't always be the case.  How do we defeat this part of the addiction?

On a side note, I have quit for over a year 2 times in the last 12 years.  It seems, staying quit is always the part that I struggle with.

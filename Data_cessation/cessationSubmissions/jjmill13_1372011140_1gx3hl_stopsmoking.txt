Day 1.

Hey, everyone. After 4 years of smoking and feeling like my body is changing for the worse from it, I've decided to seriously quit. I've said several times that I would quit, and then I'd give up cigs for about a day, and then get right back on it. But now I really want to make it official. I smoked my last cigarette last night.

The main triggers for me are: boredom, self-induced insomnia (staying up late, using cigs as a reason to stay awake), long car rides, and big meals. I think the worst of those would be long car rides. I actually have to drive 3 hours tomorrow all by myself and I know I'm going to ache for a cigarette. I was thinking about coping with that by getting an e-cigarette. Do they help at all?

Those who smoke(d) 1 pack or more per day.. When?

Serious question, I was wondering this yesterday. 

Let's say there's 16 waking hours in the day. How do / did you divide the 20+ cigarettes among those hours? 

Did you tend to smoke most of them at night? During the day? Lunch time? 

I'm not judging, just genuinely curious.

150 days down, biggest challenge overcomed

Everything was going well at home with the family close. I didn´t have any triggers anymore. Last week I was on a business trip: Lots of driving, highway rest areas, time on my own on the field, hotels nights, I even went out partying with costumers (some of them smokers) and got drunk. There were some triggers, I´ll admit,  since this was my first business trip since, so new situations where I used to smoke, etc. 

Well, I have to say it was easy: Not a single puff. My will is stronger than I thought. 150 days and counting :)

Welp, If i can quit drinking and drugging for over a year, Nicotine should be doable too...

I'm going to quit smoking...it has been about 21 hours. I am going to kill someone by Thursday, but I know Friday it will all make sense.

No lozenges or nicorette or vape for me, I know that it's nicotine i crave, and I need to cease my addiction altogether.

I made it 24 hours, then fucked up.

As I was putting on my jacket to go buy a pack because I couldn’t handle the craving, I got the notice I had made it 24 hours. I still ended up walking to get cigarettes.

Stuck to just one though, and didn’t bring cigs or my lighter today and am hoping minor social anxiety prevents me from bumming one before I get home tonight. 
I wonder how much of my struggle with quitting is from smoking Spirits. I’m trying to do one a day, with a 24 or 48 hour break once a week. Let’s see how it goes...

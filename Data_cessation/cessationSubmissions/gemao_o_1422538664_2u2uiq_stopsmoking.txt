Quitting smoking with a little help

I quit smoking 3 days ago with the help of a 6mg nicotine vaporizer. So far I've had no cravings; if anyone on here has quit with a vaporizer before, when did you decide to drop the nicotine content of your juice? I'm just wondering when to go down to 3mg, and then 0mg of nicotine. Thanks very muchly :)

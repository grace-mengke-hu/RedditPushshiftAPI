30 days until the big 365

Wow. I can't believe it's been 11 months since I smoked a cigarette. This sub has been a great help on this quit and is one of the reasons I am on my longest quit ever (hopefully permanent).

I have had a hell of a year. I lost my best friend to cancer. I've had at least 2 periods of depression. I stumbled a bit with my uni work. I cut my thumb open. I've had surgery to remove a lump. I now have a mystery illness that should hopefully be diagnosed soon but in the meantime I'm getting fucked off with it.

In the middle of all this I have certainly been tempted but I haven't succumbed. I'll be back in 30 days.

Good luck to you all!!!!!!!!

Tips for first quitting?

Hey guys, new subscriber. I've been smoking for 13/14 years now, and I think I'm ready to quit. It's a scary idea though. Smoking allows me to take a break from my day, get a few minutes of quiet time from the kids, and it just feels necessary at this point. I have two children and I quit both times I was pregnant, though it took a few months with my first. I always picked it back up after they were born though. I wish I hadn't but it is what it is now, I guess. 

So anyway, I'm thinking I need tips to help me refuse my cravings. Maybe short, easy activities to do to distract myself? I'm not sure, tbh. But I appreciate any tips! :)

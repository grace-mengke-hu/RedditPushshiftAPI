Helping my boyfriend quit... from the other side of the world

My new boyfriend is a long-time smoker and moved to Hawaii from the US east coast a couple of days ago. He just started his dream job out there, and has expressed his desire to quit smoking. I am totally supportive of this decision, since smoking is one of my biggest peeves for all the obvious reasons, but mostly because he turns into the biggest asshole when he needs a smoke. There have been moments that I’ve had to stop myself from BEGGING him to go have a cig because he’s being such a butt. At this point it’s less about the smoking and more about the affect it has on his behavior towards me and other people. I’ve expressed my feelings about it (sometimes strongly) and am almost always met with with an understanding “I know, I’m going to quit when I get to Hawaii since it will be a fresh start and also they’re so expensive there.”

I’m planning on moving out there with him in a few months. I love him and can’t wait to start a life together, but I can't continue to put up with this roller coaster ride. I haven’t given him the ultimatum, but he needs to have quit smoking by the time I get to Hawaii. 

Of course it needs to be his decision and there’s only so much I can do in the first place, but how can I best support him from the other side of the world? Last night he asked me to send him a carton, which I reluctantly agreed to initially but after thinking more about it I’m putting my foot down and won’t do it. I’m realizing that this is going to be more difficult than I expected because I know it’s not going to go well when I tell him I'm not sending them. I plan on sending him some patches, gum, etc… but any advice on how to support him mentally and emotionally? We’re very open communicators so my desire is to give him the ultimatum up front but I don’t want to do anything that will be unhelpful or inadvertently set him back at all. Any advice?

Some days are just tough...

Tough day today. Almost at one month and I went to a family function, while no one was mean about me quitting it was more just general indifference and they pretty much told me it’s no big deal and that it’s not that hard to quit(many of them are social smokers).  I know I need to grow up and that some people just aren’t going to care as it doesn’t affect their lives. It was just extra hard for me being at my parents for the weekend as they both still smoke and was kind of hoping for at least an atta girl or something (heck the party store guy I used to buy cigs at told me he was proud of me for quitting and my own family can’t even be happy for me). Anyways, sorry for the rant, I’m  just feeling frustrated right now and needed to get it out.

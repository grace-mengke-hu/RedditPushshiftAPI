Dreams?

So I’m about 3 and a half months into the quit and it’s still a struggle for me but determination has won out so far. I’m just curious if anyone else dreams about smoking? I have a smoking dream roughly once a week. I’m usually about halfway done with a cigarette(in my dream) and I realize what I’ve done and then I have all kinds of guilt and regret. I’m always disappointed with myself when I realize I’m smoking until last night when I said “screw it” and just finished the smoke. I hope this isn’t some sort of premonition of failure. Just curious if anyone else dreams of it

10 days later

50 cigs a day for 15 years. As i quit with the help of champix, and not really craving a smoke at all, i decided to stop taking the pills also after the first box was over. So i was taking it for 2 weeks, 1 while smoking and 1 after i quit. Now 3 days later no difference for me, still going strong don't care about smoking at all. Just want to point out that pills are good but probably 10% of the effort at best.

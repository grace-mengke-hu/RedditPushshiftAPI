Anyone able to quit drinking but not smoking?

I did the opposite. 7 years ago this week I quit for the last time. I woke up and I just knew I was done. 

Obviously drinking is an entirely different addiction but for me the similarity was that I quit both so many times. 

I wake up saying “I’m done. No more booze,” but the cravings always come back. Whereas, I haven’t wanted a cigarette since the night before I quit. 

I know I’m looking for an easy fix, lol!

I caved

After nine months smoke free, I picked it up again. My cat underwent massive surgery and I was scared to death. My girlfriend smokes, so I had cigarettes at home, and I started while I was waiting for the surgery to end... I don't feel these excuses are valid. None would be. I am smoking, but I do not want to be a smoker! I promised myself I will stop when my cat recovers. 

It was a stupid thing to do, but I am going to keep my word and stop again.

I will delete my flair as soon as I can (now it's not possible... Technical reasons).

I just wanted to tell someone, and this community has been so helpful... Well, I will post again soon!

Thank you all!

I need your help getting people to quit smoking with vaporizers

Hi all,

About two years ago, while I was in grad school, I helped my dad who had been smoking for 25+ years to finally quit using vaporizers. The first time he used a vaporizer he fell in love with it. Afterwards, something amazing happened. At first, he would buy juices from the local vape show, but with time his frugal personality kicked in and he started buying the raw ingredients from Amazon.

He slowly, in the course of a year reduced the nicotine level, smoke density, adn flavor in his juice down to practically zero -- today he is about to quit using the vaporizer all together -- a process that took him about two years.

Recently I decided to try to scale what he did for a bunch of people I know and it worked amazingly well, many of them have shown signs similar to my dad. Now I am scaling this up even further by creating a website and to personally formulating vaporizer juices that can help someone quit.

The service is called QuitJoy.com and I am curious if anyone else interested in the manufacturing side would like to partner up in this venture.

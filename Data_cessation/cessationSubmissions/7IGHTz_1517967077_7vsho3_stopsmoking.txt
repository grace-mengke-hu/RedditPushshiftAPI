Quitting help!

Hey all I am 2 days into my last cigarette, been smoking for a couple years, a pack a day. I just wanted to know from those out there that have quit, is there any tips to help make it easier on quitting . I have tried to quit many times before in the past but I always struggle with drowsiness/fatigue. Has anyone experienced this insane drowsiness and fatigue whilst quitting? I just want to sleep the whole day and can barely focus. If there are any tips on dealing with this I am all ears! Thank you all.

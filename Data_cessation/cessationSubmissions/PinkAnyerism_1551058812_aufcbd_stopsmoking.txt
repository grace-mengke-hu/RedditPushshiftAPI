Has anyone had success with hypnosis to quit smoking?

Either professional or self hypnosis? I'm struggling to quit, have tried several methods like patches, cold turkey, reward system, seeds and chewing gum. The longest I have gone was one month and that was cold turkey. This time I only made it five days while on the patch. I am struggling most with anger outbursts and stress smoking. Any help is greatly appreciated!

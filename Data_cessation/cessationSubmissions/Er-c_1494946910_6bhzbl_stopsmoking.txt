2 Weeks | Being a non-smoker is a much better way to live

I've been without cigs for 2 weeks. I'm always going to be perfectly capable of going back to the nasty habit. So I wouldn't dare say it's behind me. The addiction will always be ready to reassert itself. But as for smoker being a part of my identity, it's fading fast. I love being a non-smoker. Its already opened so many doors romantically and socially.

I feel like less of a shithead. And I feel good feeling like less of a shithead.

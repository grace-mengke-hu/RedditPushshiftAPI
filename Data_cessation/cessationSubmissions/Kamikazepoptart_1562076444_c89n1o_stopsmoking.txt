Quitting for the 100th time, first time for MYSELF and not others

As the title says, I've quit over the years because a significant other/family/friends wanted me to, but I've never wanted it myself until now.

I'm at 3 days, 13 hours and the cravings aren't even the issue. It's the depression+anxiety that's getting to me. I'm already on Celexa but am using low dose nicotine patches and Wellbutrin. I can't sleep. I get sad frequently about things that are valid, but that I've been masking for a long time. 

And OMG the overeating!!! I find myself snacking without even realizing it. My boss brought a huuuuuge cheese platter to work, and guess what I've been doing all day. Does anyone have any tips on how to cope?

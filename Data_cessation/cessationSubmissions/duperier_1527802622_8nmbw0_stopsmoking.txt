Struggling to actually commit to quitting

I’ve been lurking on this subreddit for several weeks now. I get really inspired by everyone’s success stories and it’s nice to see such positive energy and encouragement on each post.
That being said, I can’t seem to muster up enough of my own will power to take the leap towards actually quitting. I’m sometimes able to manage my cravings throughout the day while I’m at work, but I still struggle in the mornings and evenings. It’s so much easier to give in to the itch than it is to resist. 
I’m fully aware of how harmful and useless the cigarettes are, but often each craving is met with an “oh why not” or an “I’ve earned this one”. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated.
Keep up the good work, everyone.

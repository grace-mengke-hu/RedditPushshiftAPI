The time for an end is right now.

I've been smoking for about 3 years and I've been using it as a form of self medication to knock off the edge of my anxiety. I'm noticing it's talking it's tole on my lungs. With it being close to summer and my allergies kicking up, I don't want to go through the pain of coughing from the smoke mixed with the allergies anymore. This is the best choice and decision for myself. I know what I am heading into and I am not looking forward to it but I know I can do it!

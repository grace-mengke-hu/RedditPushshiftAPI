When do the weird dreams end?

So, I quit a few weeks ago and it's been really smooth for me. I haven't had cravings really. It seems like it's been more breaking the habit than anything. But....I've been having really vivid and really weird dreams. Not of smoking; neither I nor anyone else in any of my dreams has smoked. But they've been....weird. Super realistic and just enough reality in them to make my brain think they could actually be happening or really have happened. It's to the point where I'm not getting restful sleep. 

When does this go away??

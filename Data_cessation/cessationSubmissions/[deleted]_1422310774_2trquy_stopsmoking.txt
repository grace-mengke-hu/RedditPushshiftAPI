Help! My family thinks I've still quit.

Here's the deal.  Been smoking for 18 years, and I quit back in November with the help of patches.  I stopped using patches after a few weeks, and all was going well. I felt great. 

Then I found a stray in my car a couple of weeks ago, and well, it was all down hill from there.  I don't even know why I smoked it. The worst part is, is my family (who I don't live with, I live on my own) still think I've quit. I don't smoke at home, and I've fallen back into the habit of having one or two in the morning with coffee, and a few in the evening after work.  Also - my smoking app is still set to November, and every time it pops up with a new badge, I just want to cry.

Quitting the second time around is SO MUCH HARDER! How the hell can I beat this? I'd appreciate any advice you have if you've been in a similar position.

Edit: I have a couple of vapers that I use around my family (they're ok with this); I used to find them a great help, now I find them virtually no help at all.

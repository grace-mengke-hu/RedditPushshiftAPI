Day 2.

Coming up on my 48th hour without a cigarette.  I've definitely had cravings, but I've been fighting them off with gum (just plain ol' Trident).  I'm chewing like a maniac, but it's better than killing myself.  Even went to the bar last night and I surprisingly wasn't fiending. This is my first attempt at quitting after smoking the past 5 years.  The habit has only gotten worse, so I figured it was time to stop.  I don't even know why I'm posting here... I guess just to tell somebody.  Holding off on telling my friends, mostly because I've been avoiding them, don't want to be tempted.

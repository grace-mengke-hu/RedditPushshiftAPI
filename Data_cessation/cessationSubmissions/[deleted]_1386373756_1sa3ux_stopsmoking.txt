Concerns of quitting

Recently I started smoking, its been about two months and I decided to quit two weeks ago. After quitting for a week I broke and ended up smoking this past week. After starting again I recently started becoming nauseous after smoking and as well become dizzy. I developed a hoarse voice and irritated throat. If this doesn't make my want to quit strongrt I dont know what will. I'm new to this subreddit and need support in quitting!

It's been 12 hours and I'm very happy with the decision I've made.

This morning I smoked my last cigarette. I've been smoking for a little over a year now, and can already feel the negative side effects it has on my body, along with all the other bad habits it encourages me to have. Poor diet, not working out, being a lazy bum all the time. I know that if I don't do it now I'll only continue down this road and it'll get worse. Stay strong everyone, and have a good night.

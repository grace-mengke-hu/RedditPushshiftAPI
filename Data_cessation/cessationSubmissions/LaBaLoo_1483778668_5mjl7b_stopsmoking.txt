The cravings were strong tonight ... so I downloaded a Quit Smoking App to my phone!

The cravings were strong tonight and I've been reading and posting on here for a few hours now!  I've been realizing that one of the things that really helps me is how everyone shares what works for them to get through triggers or cravings ... and those stories really inspire me and give me strength!  

So tonight I was thinking:  what can I do that I haven't already done to distract me from the cravings?  Someone else had just posted about their progress on their quit smoking app -- and that's when it hit me:  I can download a Quit Smoking App!  It tells me how much time I have, how much money I've saved, and tracks health information based on my quit date.  Things like reducing my chances of a heart attack, my lungs becoming healthy again, lower blood pressure.  

The app is also another way I can reward myself in the moment.  I can look at my home screen and immediately see my progress!  That's really tangible and gives me a deep feeling of satisfaction! 

I know I say it all the time, but I am SO grateful this sub is here.  I am SO grateful for everyone who posts and comments.  Every story inspires me.  I feel like we are walking a journey together and supporting each other every step of the way.  Thank you for being here /r/stopsmoking!!  

Stay strong and don't smoke no matter what!

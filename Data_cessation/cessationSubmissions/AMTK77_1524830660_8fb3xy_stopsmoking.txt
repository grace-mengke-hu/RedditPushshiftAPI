What helps me through the cravings

I am on day 18 and I still have cravings. l quit cold turkey after smoking 15-25 cigs a day for 22 yrs. The cravings are not severe and they pass pretty quickly which is great. I'm hoping that I have none at all someday soon. These are a few things I have found help with fighting the craving:
Reading posts on here has been IMO the best distraction.
Taking 5-10 deep breaths.
Drinking water.
Exercising - even just for a few mins til craving passes.
Snacking -preferably on healthy snacks but for me at the moment anything goes.
Keep up the good work all of you quitters and we can conquer this addiction with each other's support.ðŸ˜ƒ

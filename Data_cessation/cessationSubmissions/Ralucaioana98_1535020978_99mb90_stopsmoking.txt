The amazing life of a non-smoker

When I was smoking I constantly asked myself how is a nonsmoker living? What are they doing when they’re bored? What are they doing when drinking? When drinking coffee? Etc. It always kind of intrigued me.

I am 5 days in my journey but I find it really exciting to live as a non smoker, it’s like living a new life or discovering new things or healthy habits. I know it’s good to avoid alcohol at the beginning but I had a few glasses of wine a few days ago and was excited to see how the tipsy experience of a non smoker is. Lucky I didn’t craved any and it was a very fun experience. Felt like dancing a lot instead. 

The thing I love the most about quitting smoking is that I always smell nice. I am really girly girl and I love how nice my clothes and my hair smells constantly.
 
I love not wasting my time going for a smoke every hour and a half. 

I love not spending money every 1-2 days on a new pack.

I love not having to cary something wherever I go.

I don’t wanna ask you guys for any advice just want to share my excitement for my new life and share the positive (not health related) sides of quitting smoking. Plus I am curious if anyone shares the same feeling. 

What do you love about being a non-smoker?

Finally quit for real!!

Today marks one month without smoking a cigarette. I can hardly believe this is real, as I never really thought I'd do it. 
I used Alan Carr's The Easy Way and it actually worked, to my boyfriends surprise. I had faith in it, but he thought how can that possibly work if you're smoking while you're reading the material? He saw me not physically smoking while using the patches, and thought that was more effective. But the Easy Way works by addressing the "why" of smoking, instead of the "how". This was the fundamental difference that ultimately led to my success. The patches  couldn't work for me because it felt like cheating, like I was skirting around the issue. While the Easy Way feels genuine and real. I feel like I've faced it head on. 

Fuck yeah for living smoke free!!

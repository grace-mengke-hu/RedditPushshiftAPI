Smoking while drinking.

Hello all. This is my first time posting here. I was a pack a day smoker until about 3 years ago. While I quit smoking on a day to day basis, I still can't resist when I'm drunk. I'm just out of college so I drink/party fairly regularly still. Sometimes I smoke almost up to a pack on a night out so it definitely is still impacting my health. Any advice on how to stop when drinking? Thanks!

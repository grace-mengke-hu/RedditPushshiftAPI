Seeking advice for the smokers flu

Hello quitters! I am quitting smoking while I wait to go to basic for the Air Force. Last cigarette was 7 days ago. I'm being hit by the smokers flu for a second time and it's brutal. The worst part for me is constant sneezing/runny nose and the body aches. What have you done to deal with the symptoms?

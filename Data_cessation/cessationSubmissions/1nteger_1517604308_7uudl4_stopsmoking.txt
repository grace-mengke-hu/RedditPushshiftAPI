A question for those who’ve quit smoking

So I think I have a lot of bad habits I am trying to fix, I’m not going to really go into them, but there are numerous addictions and problems I am working on. How do you prioritize what addiction to combat first? I feel like Trying to stop everything will lead in instant failure.

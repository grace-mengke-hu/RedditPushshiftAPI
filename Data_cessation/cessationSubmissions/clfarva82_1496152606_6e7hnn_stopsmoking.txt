1 week tonight!!!

It will be one week that I haven't had a cigarette at 11pm central time. It's been very hard. The cravings are pretty intense at times. The hardest part for me is that I feel like I'm missing something or forgetting something.. I learned that when I get a craving I take a little bit of salt and put it in my mouth and it kinda makes the craving go away. I'm proud of finally beating this horrible habit. I'm fortunate enough to have a great support system even from someone many states away from me. If I can do it anyone can.. come on reddit people let's not cave in and let's beat this together!! 

I will not smoke with you all today nor the rest of my life!!

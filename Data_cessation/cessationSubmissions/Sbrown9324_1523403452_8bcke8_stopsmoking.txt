Smoked 33 years - Quit 2 months 23 days now

Still taking the 2 mg lozenge a few times a day but no smoking. Was with close friends last night that were smoking like chimneys in their house ate more lozenges but held strong. Still having urges and doubting but trying to hold strong. Does the shortness of breath spells ever go away? Or is it likely COPD?

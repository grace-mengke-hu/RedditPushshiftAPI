Got some bad news today

So...I have precancerous growth in my cervix. Mild dysplasia. It should go away on its own in a couple years if I take care of myself, problem is I treat my body like shit. 
Iâ€™m 21, been smoking since I was 13 and have quit a couple times, the longest was for 6 months. Every time I try to quit, I end up smoking again in a couple of days. But if I want this to go away, I have to quit for real. 
Does anyone have any advice on how to make the quit stick this time?

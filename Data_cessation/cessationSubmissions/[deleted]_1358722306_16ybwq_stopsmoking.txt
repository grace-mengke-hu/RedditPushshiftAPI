Smoked for eight years, quit cold turkey. Didn't look back... or even bother counting the months. A little bit before Christmas last year I quit smoking and it was the easiest bad habit I dropped.

I simply didn't want to smoke anymore. I don't understand what all the bitching and moaning is about.

Seven days.

Psh.

Ive had my last puff.

Hello, Ive been a closet smoker for a good part of a year now and what I mean by that is that ive quit once before and relapsed but didnt want to upset the family and friends. Today im coming out and decided to quit not for anyone but myself. I thought talking about it on this subreddit would help with motivation. I see the 726 badges and 100 day badges some people have on here; I want to be there too eventually. So today is my day. I quit today at 11:30pm 12-19-13. And I will quit one day at a time. Here I go.

I need to quit

I'm 19 turning 20 soon. Been smoking since about junior year of high school. I just smoked half a cigarette then threw the rest of the pack away. Before this I was 2 weeks clean. I want to stay 200 years clean. What did you guys do that helped you quit? I find that I smoke the most when I'm drunk. Any tips would be greatly appreciated. I think I'm going on a run tomorrow too. Time to get my lungs and life back in my own control.

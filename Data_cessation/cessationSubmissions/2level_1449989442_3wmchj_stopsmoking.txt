Anger is a resource

That warm feeling of contentment, ease that I associated with the "perfect" cig was very difficult to battle time and again with willpower. 
It was strange how vivid that feeling was and how extraordinarily rare the "almost perfect cig" were.
 Then I learned that feeling is a fake, an illusion: nicotine hijacks my reward circuits and turn them into an inner junkie. The dopamine pathways  are activated by nicotine so they associate positive feelings and "facts" with nicotine. The junkie conceives misleading thoughts to get the next fix.       

The reward circuit is meant to give me energy to make plans, to feel good after achievements or when interacting positively with other human beings. 

So I feel betrayed, nicotine was like a cheating partner, it felt good but was bullshit.        

Nicotine is a fucking drug, almost as addictive as cocaine, it is not illegal because there is an entire industry which makes money from it.     

If a craving is difficult I remember the above and my anger explodes shattering that madness

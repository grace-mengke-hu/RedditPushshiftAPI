After a lot of hits and misses, this is finally it.

I've had my last cigarette this morning. My mission is to gain control and the way I'll do it, is to keep saying those two words out loud and in my head, every time I feel like having a smoke from here. I will remember I'm doing this not only for myself but for my gentle So and my kid. I owe them and I owe me this. 

Here I go.

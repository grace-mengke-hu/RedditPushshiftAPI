6 Months!! Thank you /r/stopsmoking!

Hey just wanted to say thanks to all you wonderful people in /r/stopsmoking because this former 15 year pack a day smoker can now say he's been smoke free for 6 months. I quit cold turkey after finding this subreddit and subsequently read Allen Carr's phenomenal book. The first week was really rough but checking in on everyone's progress on this forum made all the difference! For those of you struggling or on the fence, it gets better! Once you decide to stop feeding the little monster, with every second that passes it is getting weaker! You can do it! Once again, Thank You!

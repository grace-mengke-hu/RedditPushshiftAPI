Relapsed after 8 days. Need advice

Was a five a day smoker for 1 year. 
I quit after coming across Allen Carr’s book. The first day was great but the ones that followed were terrible. Craving a smoke almost constantly. I’m a med student(the irony) and have exams coming up, I just couldn’t focus. I was feeling unhappy overall. Finally had one thinking I would quit after my exams in January. I know the right answer is to quit right now but I couldn’t get into the frame of mind to study and I can’t afford to fuck up my finals. 
I’m feeling really ashamed that I have to tell my girlfriend I relapsed. Any support or advice is appreciated.

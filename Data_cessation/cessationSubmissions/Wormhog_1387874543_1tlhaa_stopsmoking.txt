So.... Today I celebrate a decade without a cigarette. The best gift you can give yourself!

If you have a few days off work, there's no time like the present. If there's any secret at all to this success, it's never to get too confident. Never allow yourself only one. Never think of it as a treat. It's a punishment. I don't miss it. I am happy for every day where I don't suffer a nic fit. I wish the same for all of you. Give yourself a gift this year. I will usually take PMs from those who are still struggling.

So peace, quitters! Have a safe holiday! You CAN do it. WANT it.

Edit: Thanks, this and the struggle to overcome my public speaking phobia are two of my most proud achievements, and the toughest. If anyone quits on new year's and is losing their mind, please send me a private message and I will do my best to talk you down off the ceiling. I appreciate every upvote on this post, guys. Thanks.

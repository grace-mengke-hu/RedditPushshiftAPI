I quit smoking last January, but yesterday was my 1 year nicotine anniversary.

Super proud and I need to tell someone!  I used the patch because cold turkey didn't turn out too well the first time I tried quitting in 2014.  I know lots  of people on here say to quit nicotine altogether, but my goal was to stop my tobacco use  and I was completely ok with continuing to use nicotine if it meant I was no longer using tobacco (which was a great brain trick for myself;  just knowing that I didn't have to withdraw from nicotine if I didn't want to really helped my quit)Yesterday was the 1 year anniversary of my ending my time using any nicotine products (following the recommended taper-off on the back of the box).   Remember; it doesn't matter *how* you quit, as long as you stick to the quit!

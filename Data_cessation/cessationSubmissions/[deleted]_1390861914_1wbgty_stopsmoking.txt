In the name of poker I had a fall, not resetting, it did nothing for me.

Almost 3 months in.  I've had  10ish drags during the 90 days from friends last drags and was sufficient for me to get flavor without any nicotine dose to grab me again.  This last week I played poker and bum a smoke during the smoke break because I haven't played in years and wanted the nostalgia.  It didn't do anything for me.  Strange that there wasn't even a buzz after such a long break.  

Though doing nothing for me was exactly what I wanted it to do.  I'm not resetting over this because I feel 100% still that I am a non-smoker and that number represents the days I've been a non-smoker, not the times a non-smoker had an isolated smoke.

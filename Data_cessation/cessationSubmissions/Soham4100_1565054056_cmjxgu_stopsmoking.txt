Any experience/ scientific data ?

Hey! 
I smoked around 10 everyday for a year.
I still miss everything about it but my cravings have finally gone.
It has been around 4 months since I've quit 
However when I get the occasional crave or for some reason in the future I have maybe say a pack over a weekend ( I know I shouldn't and won't but just in case), does that mean I will go through withdrawal ALL OVER again? Or?

Any input is appreciated, thanks

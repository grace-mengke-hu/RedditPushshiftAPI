Any tips on dealing with withdrawal symptoms at work?

I work a very stressful job and I’m ready to quit smoking NOW. I’m looking for tips on dealing with withdrawal symptoms while at work or even out doing activities?

 I tried to quit about a year ago and I remember my big symptoms included fatigue, depression and irritability, I lasted about 3 days when I just couldn’t take the symptoms anymore...but now I feel that I am stronger and that I can do it

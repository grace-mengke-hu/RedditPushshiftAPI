My sister of 16 wants to start smoking.

I (M23) went trough all of the "You know i was a smoker and you've heard me say it was the dumbest thing i had ever done" and the "scare" tactics, and subtle manipulation but she seems hellbent on "fitting in". Described to her that her high-school friends are the most transient people that shell probably ever have in her life, didn't care. Told her that her health should be NO1 priority, "i know but its cool". Pleaded for her to use pure rational reasoning, nope.

Now at the moment she told me this in confidence and i am not intending to ever share this with our parents is she doesn't. But, i will most likely break her trough her guilt and she will confess in about a week or so. I should note that i wasn't confrontational AT ALL. I just remained the "cool older brother that wont get mad"

So.... what the fuck do i do? Do i just sit there and tell her "Told you so, go to /r/stopsmoking" in a few years time? Its infuriating seeing her being dumb and irrational and not listening to advice

**TLDR;** **My sister wants to start smoking, what do?**

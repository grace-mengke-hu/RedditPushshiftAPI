Five and a Half Hours In: Can't Stop Thinking About a Drag

I haven't had a cigarette in about 15 and a half hours, but then I was sleeping; I've been up and running for five and a half hours now.  I was fine - doing my own thing, not much thinking about it - and them BAM! and I can't stop thinking about a cigarette.  I've played every possible scenario out in my head that could justify a smoke: I've told myself that I'm not committed to quitting and that it's not too late to go back to smoking; I've considered that I could cut back gradually instead of quitting cold-turkey.  Every effort to distract myself is fruitless, and my mind just keeps going back to smoking.  It's kind of driving me nuts right now, which I suspect is obvious from my ranting.  It's just weird because of how suddenly it came and how strongly it came.  Any advice about these sudden, powerful, distracting, seemingly-endless moments?

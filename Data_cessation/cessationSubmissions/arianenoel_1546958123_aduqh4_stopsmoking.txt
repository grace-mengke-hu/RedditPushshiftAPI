Day 5: Turns our quitting because you have a darling toddler doesnâ€™t exactly help the cravings. WTF?

I am quitting for many reasons, but primarily because I have a *darling* 2-year old toddler and want to be there for him when he grows up. My partner is still smoking though, which really sucks. This morning I wanted to smoke with him. Instead I looked at our baby monitor and reminded myself why I am quitting. Well, that didnâ€™t stop the cravings. I am feeling very weak right now because I want to do this for my kiddo, but the cravings are legit. Anyway, just wanted to share. Feeling like a terrible parent right now. And want to stab my partner in the eyes ðŸ˜‚ #terribleparent

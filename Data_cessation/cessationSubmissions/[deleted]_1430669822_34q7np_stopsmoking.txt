Have a surgery in 3 days. I've already not smoked for 4 days but I need to avoid nicotine for at-least 18 more days. How do you warriors do it?

Hello

I've got a plastic surgery operation to be done on me in 3 more days. I was advised to stop smoking for 1 week pre op and 2 weeks post op. 

Well, it's been 4 days and I miss cigarette so much. Unfortunately, I've got 18 more days to go. 

How do I survive ? :(

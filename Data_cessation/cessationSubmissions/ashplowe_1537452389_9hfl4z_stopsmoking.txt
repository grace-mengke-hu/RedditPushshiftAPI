3 months in and I convinced myself to it was ok to relapse. Full of regret

It started as a puff of someone else's Juul at a party and turned into a constant nagging, tugging voice in the back of my head. My junkie brain gave every reason under the sun why I should start vaping again. 'I really miss it' 'I won't do it as much as I used to' 'Im not really ready to quit!' 'It was easy the last time, I can quit again no problem'

Going to the store for new pods I was almost giddy with excitement. I popped one in my Juul as soon as I was out of the store and inhaled. I felt...immediate regret, sadness, guilt. It didn't feel as amazing as I thought it would. I can't believe I let myself talk myself back into this! 

Like I completely forgot the asthma attack that was my wake-up call to quit, or how I gained 10lbs to do so, or that my insides we're messed up for two weeks due to nicotine withdrawal but I made it through anyway. For what? I just threw those sacrifices away. I thought it would be a relief to start again but it's just the opposite. 

Don't be like me. Stay strong. Start committed.

12 years and I'm finally ready to be done

I'm sure you guys all know "my" story.  Picked up the habit in College, then hit it hard in University.  Got married, promised to stop, worked for about 6 months, back to the pack.  Had my first kid, promised to stop, back again in 2 months.  Second kid, promised again, less than a month.  All in all I've "quit" over a dozen times, and that first time was by far the longest.

I know it's terrible for my body, but it feels so good.  It's part of a calming ritual for me now, and I think that's my huge problem.  I'm a teacher, so my stress-levels are generally through the roof, and I always end up giving in and buying a pack when something ridiculous happens; it just always seems to happen when I'm trying to quit, then I give up until "it's more calm again".  

Not anymore.  As I mentioned, I'm a teacher with multiple kids and a single income.  I just can't AFFORD to smoke anymore.  I NEED to stop, I just don't know how to.

I did Cold Turkey the first time.  I tried Chantix, patches, gum, and vaping.

My plan this time is to buy a gym membership.  It's cheaper than smoking and I'll feel bad if I don't use it.  I know that one of the keys to defeating an addictive behavior is to replace it with something healthy, and I know people who have successfully replaced smoking with exercise.

Any tips or suggestions for me?  I've read a couple books on addiction, and I just downloaded Carr's Easy Way (since I've heard it might help. 

Anyway, I'm really doing it this summer.  I hope.

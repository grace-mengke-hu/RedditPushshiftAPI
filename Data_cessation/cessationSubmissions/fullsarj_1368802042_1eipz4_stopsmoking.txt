Almost a week in - brain starting to make ridiculous excuses

So the first few days weren't even that hard. But now two nights ago I had a dream that I smoked cigarettes.  Since then I've been really craving cigs. And my brain is making excuses - like, "Well, you want to be able to be cool with your friends (in the dream I was smoking with old friends who I miss a lot) and occasionally smoke to socialize, so you should smoke once in a while now just to stay in practice." Or, "How will you be able to handle smoking a spliff if your lungs get too tender?" Yeah, ridiculous, illogical, but doesn't make it any easier, as you all know.

EDIT: I mean how stupid is it that I'm thinking that "I don't want my lungs to get too tender." And it makes sense right now. I really would prefer that my lungs not get too tender - at the moment that's how I feel anyway.

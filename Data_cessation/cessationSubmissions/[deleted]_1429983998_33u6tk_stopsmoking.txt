Day 24: Realizations and feeling blue.

Few hours ago I found a nice song, and what I used to do was to play music on the speakers in the bathroom (good acoustic haha) while I smoked. It was really relaxing. I know I can still do the same thing, minus the smoking, but it won't be the same nor as good.  It just made me feel sad that I won't be able to experience that again.  

I also realized that going outside to smoke was forcing me to sit outside and sort out my mind. Without smoking I don't have multiple clear-cut breaks during my day to prioritize stuff to get done, nor rev my engine to motivate myself. 

I probably should've mentioned that I recently graduated university and currently in the process of job hunting. Although quitting smoking seemed like perfect timing, it has hurt my ability to motivate and organize myself. I know that these issues can be easily tackled, and it makes me seem incompetent and lazy. But I'm just sad by the realization of how much cigarettes have affected the nooks and crannies of being me, as I used to think of myself as a 'self-motivated person'.

I just really want to pick up smoking again, just during the process of job hunting. At the same time I'm worried that if I excuse myself out of doing the cold turkey right now, I will keep finding excuses to pick it back up. ughh, I don't know what to do :(

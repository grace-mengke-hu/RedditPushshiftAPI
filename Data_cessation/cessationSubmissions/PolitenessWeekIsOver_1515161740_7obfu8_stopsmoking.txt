Friday Night! I hate it I hate it I hate it

I am sorry, I need a void to scream into. I am sitting in this country I dont speak the language of and I got addicted to smoking because I was lonely. I take full responsibility, I did this to myself, but it sucks so much. Its friday night, I want to go out and meet people, but I know outside in the bars everyone will be smoking and I will bum one off of someone. Throughout the week work was full of corporate back stabbing in which I became the target and then a pawn. And now on friday night I dont even get to have any fun. I feel really upset.

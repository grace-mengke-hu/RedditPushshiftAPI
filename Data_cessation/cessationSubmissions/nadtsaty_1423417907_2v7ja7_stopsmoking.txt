Started from here, now we're at the bottom

(Sorry for my English) 
So, I can't say, that I smoke for a long time. It's only a year. Now I'm 19 and I don't want to do it more. It's expensive, it's harmful, it's bad for your teeth, you smells bad, and this is not better, than drug addiction, even if it's less harmfull. 
You can say, that you can easily stop this after just one year, a lot of people here smokes for decades, but it's hard, and this fact scares me. So, maybe it is childly, but I hope, that method of achivements helps me don't come back to this kind of slavery.
Stay srong, be healthy, peace.

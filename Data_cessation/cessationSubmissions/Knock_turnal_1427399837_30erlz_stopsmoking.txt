Heading into uncharted territory

It's the middle of spring break, and I haven't had a drink or a cigarette since it started, and this is the longest I've gone in 10 years, a pack a day, and on raging weekends, a pack a night. People keep asking me, "so what are you doing for Spring Break?" and I tell them "not much." But I've really just been at home going on runs, reading, creative things, and keeping myself away from the bar so that I can get a good jump on this. Stay strong 'erry body!

Stopped smoking but it feels like I am going crazy

The first day of smoking I was really deeply depressed, I didnt do anything besides eating junk and lying in my bed. I could not do anything other than that, even showering was a heavy task. Im now on day three and the depression from the first day is much better but I am still feeling like I am going crazy, my mind is fogy, I cant really decide what I want to think, my senses are weird, my coordination sucks, it feels I am going manic, or that I am loosing my mind. I actually am a little terrified of myself and I dont know at this time if this will stay this way for weeks, and if the whole thing is worth it, or if this will stop after a couple of days? Does anybody else have had such a bad withdrawal? Thanks!

Awesome moment!

So, tomorrow will be 80 days for me - which blows my mind! I'm still having awesome moments, and a big one happened for me last week. Every November at work we have to enroll in our healthcare - make options, plan on how much to contribute to the HSA, etc. One big item is the "tobacco user election". I was so happy to check off "non-smoker" for the first time! It may not seem like a big deal, but for me it feels like I am officially a non-smoker :)

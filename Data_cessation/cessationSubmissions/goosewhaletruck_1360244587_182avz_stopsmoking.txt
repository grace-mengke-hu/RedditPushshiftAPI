After around 2 years of looking at your pictures of packs in the garbage/sink I think I'm finally on board.

I haven't bought a pack since Thanksgiving and haven't had a cigarette for a week. I've been running then working out every weekday for the last three weeks and the best part: I don't have cravings that come from nowhere anymore. I've smoked on and off for 8 years and I'm sure saying "no" will be hard sometimes but I'm happy to be where I'm at and hope I never go backwards.

I'm gonna request my badge now. Cheers folks.

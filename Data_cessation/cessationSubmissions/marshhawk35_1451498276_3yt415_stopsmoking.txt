Heading into Day 17, and it's getting easier

I'm not overconfident. I know there will be more hurdles ahead. But at just a few hours shy of 17 days, it's suddenly gotten much easier. Cravings are much reduced in frequency and intensity. I still get them but they feel more manageable. My skin was a nightmare for the past two weeks but has suddenly cleared up - clearer than I can ever remember it being as an adult. And the taste of air! I can breathe deeper than I've been able to for a long time, and the air tastes sweet and fresh. 

I never thought I could get here, but if I can do it, you can too. Remember, you lose nothing by quitting. You gain your life, your hope, your health, your money, and your dignity and confidence back.

Here's to a smoke-free New Years Eve, everyone!

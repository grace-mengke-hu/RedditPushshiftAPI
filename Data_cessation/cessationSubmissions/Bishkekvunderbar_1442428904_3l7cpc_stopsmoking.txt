Lack of Focus

Hey all, writing this note from work. I'm nearly finished the first 24 hours smoke free, and it's not too bad so far - cravings are definitely there and I'm more fidgety than usual, but nothing I can't handle. 

The thing I'm noticing more than anything is how exhausted and lethargic I feel. I have felt zoned out all day and have been only barely functional at work. Even been having difficulty with everyday conversations - someone will mention something and it will take me 10 seconds to process what they're talking about. 

Anyone else experience this? When does this go away?

I finally quit smoking

After months of lurking this subreddit reading the advice and motivation everyone gives to each other I finally quit! I have been cig free for almost 3 weeks now. At first I used an e-cig to help with the transition than I dropped the e-cig shortly after that! I am so proud of myself and I wouldn't of been able to do it with the kind and friendly advice of this sub reddit!

Need to help my GF quit

Hey all-

My GF has been smoking since grad school (now in her 40's) and she says she is about a 1 pack a week smoker.  She gets super ashamed, and feels really bad when I ask her about it.  She really wants to quit.

Last week we went on a trip, and she didn't smoke for 9 days.  She wasn't too stressed out except for the first day (airplanes do that to me too).  Unfortunately her first day back at work she broke down.

I really don't want to make her feel bad, and want to help her.  Any thoughts on what I could read, or how to help her in a positive way?

I'm kind of new to reddit, so I'm not sure if there is a FAQ I should be reading.

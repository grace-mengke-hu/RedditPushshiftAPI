Rage Since Quitting

It's day three today. I haven't had any cigarettes since Friday afternoon, having quit while at a spa weekend with non-smoking friends (that part was easy). I had a bit of weed last night (weed is almost universally mixed with tobacco in joints around here) but I haven't had any nicotine this morning. I smoke 25-35 rollups on a typical day and I am 26.

My problem is that I don't know how to control my relentless rage. Anything seems to set it off, most recently my boyfriend's poor dishwasher-loading skills.

I freaked out my dog a bit with slamming kitchen cupboard doors and she went to hide behind the sofa :( I am usually excellent at controlling my anger but I am really struggling to keep calm.

I don't want a cigarette but I don't want to remain in this state of rage. I am very much an all-or-nothing person and find NRT just as addictive as smoking, meaning the only way I can quit is cold turkey (tried many times with lozenges, patches, ecigs etc). My last cessation lasted 3 years but I wasn't stressed then. That was cold turkey so I know I can do it I just need to get past this stage.

Thanks for listening.

Oh, I have also battered an internal door to a woody mess. It needed replacing anyway and felt slightly therapeutic.

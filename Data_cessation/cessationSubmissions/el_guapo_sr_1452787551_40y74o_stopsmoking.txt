10 days today! First real relapse temptation yesterday but I survived

Just posting as a way to keep myself honest.  Really had a desire yesterday when I was hanging out with my friend who was smoking.   Quit cold turkey and have not read the book that seems to be a bible here, but I really felt the desire wanting to smoke after smelling it and longing for how it could "help" with my stress.   But I was firm in saying no, and thankfully didn't.  I feel better now, but it was close yesterday.  10 down,  time to start day 11

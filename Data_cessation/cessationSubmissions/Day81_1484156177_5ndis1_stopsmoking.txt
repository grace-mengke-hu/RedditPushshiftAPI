It's been 17 hours

Well, if my math is right.  5:30PM Central yesterday was my last cigarette.  I feel like I've been craving non-stop since I started driving to work this morning.  Part of me feels like I should've waited due to shitty events recently (in short, not being able to trust my wife anymore) but it's happening.  I just hope I don't relapse and find a way to deal with all the BS in my life right now without running out and buying another pack.

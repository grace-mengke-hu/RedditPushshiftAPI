Did any of you quit smoking for a job?

I had a job interview today that I feel went really well. I was given a paper application to fill out and send in. 

One of the questions is do I smoke? Yes or no.  I feel like if I put yes I won't get hired or even to the second interview. If I put no well then I'll have to quit or real and not just say one day I will.   

I quit about five years ago doing the gum. It got to the point where I didn't even need the gum anymore. I feel like quiting for a reason (other than my health, which is fine at the moment. Well no known problems) will help me really quit. 

Any thoughts on this?

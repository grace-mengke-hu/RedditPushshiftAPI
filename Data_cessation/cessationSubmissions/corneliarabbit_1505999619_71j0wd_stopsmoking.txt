Cravings galore!

I quit smoking cold turkey in May. Up till my most recent quit, I had maybe 6 smokes a day.

For the past 2-3 weeks I've been getting more severe cravings, and I've even had several dreams about smoking (usually waking up with extreme guilt). I experienced this shortly after I quit, which was expected - but after this long I'm a bit worried. Is this normal? Will it go away? I'm not considering picking it up again, but it's still there in the back of my mind.

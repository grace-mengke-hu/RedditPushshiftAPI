What Worked For You When Nothing Else Did?

I've been struggling with my smoking addiction for the past 7 years (been smoking longer, but 7 years ago was the first time I tried to quit).


I feel like I've tried everything, there's just something in me that keeps going back to those darn smokes.


I'm curious... those of you who struggled to quit for ages and finally succeeded, what was your personal breakthrough?

P.S. â€“ My badge is not correct, I have yet to actually quit.

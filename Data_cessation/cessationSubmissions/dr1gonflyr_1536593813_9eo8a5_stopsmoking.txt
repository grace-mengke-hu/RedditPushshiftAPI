Vaping kind of helps

Hi, 

Since I had a failed attempt at cold-turkey (2 months clean, gained weight etc etc) I decided to try vaping. I had a lot of withdrawal symptoms, dreaming of cigarettes although I was taking a nicotine liquid. I gradually decreased the nicotine, and since several days (about a week) I am completely nicotine free. 

It is weird but it kind of works. I don't feel the same addiction and I don't want to light a cigarette but I definitely miss the nicotine. I know it takes about 2 weeks to get clean and I hope I won't go back, definitely not to smoking. 

I am hearing that the vapes can make you feel out of breath, and there is some truth to this claim - but nothing like what you will feel like when you are smoking. I started vaping 6 months ago and although it takes getting used to, my physical activity is better than ever, I lost weight because I gained some confidence and really, if you want to quit the softer way, give it a try. 

And fingers crossed - I will stop the nicotine and ultimately, the vaping, too :)

Today is the day.

I've been smoking for 39 years, minus the 27 days that I've decided to quit last November.  There's but a few cigarettes left in my pack and once I've smoked these I AM DONE.  I hate the smell, I hate the dirty looks I get, and I hate throwing what little money I have away on these coffin nails.  Today is the day.

7 months in and I am getting a cold once a month, what's happening?

Everyone seems to think my theory is crazy, but I know I've been getting sick because I quit smoking. It all started a couple of months after I quit... September to be exact. I got a cold. And then I got 2 colds in October. And one every month until last month I came down with walking pneumonia. Now I have yet another cold, this time it's knocking me on my booty. I'm on steroids and antibiotics again, but I am getting his nagging feeling that something isn't right. I will get blood results back soon, so we will see. Every doctor I've seen seems to think my body is healing or that I just have a bad immune system (I never got sick before this).. even though I've never heard of this happening before. Please, someone tell me this is normal!

Any advice on quitting whilst living with a smoker?

My partner is a smoker. I am trying to quit but my will power is weak and i'm having a tough time resisting a quick smoke now and then during the day. Especially when i can smell it in the apartment (smoking indoors yes. bad, i know.).  Would appreciate any advice on how to deal with it.

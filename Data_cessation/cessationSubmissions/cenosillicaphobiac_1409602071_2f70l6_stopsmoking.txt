Back from vacation

Yet another set of triggers behind me.  I guess for the rest of my life, the first time I do something as a non-smoker is going to trigger some nostalgia, even when smoking was really a pain.  Two flights, no stopping before hand, both times on tight schedules and no "but baby I need a smoke first" and then stopping on the way out even before grabbing luggage.  Every time we waited for a table at dinner, because it was a vacation it felt a tiny bit like something was missing.  Even hanging out in the hotel room was a bit of reminder that I used to stand on the balcony and smoke (no smoking on balcony signs be damned!!)

All in all it was very nice to not be tied to smoking.  At the rehearsal dinner I didn't see a single person smoke, and at the wedding I only smelled a single smoker.

There was only one moment where my brain tried to trick me.  After the rehearsal dinner somebody broke out a big bag of cigars, and my brain said "hey, look at all these guys smoking cigars, and they aren't even smokers, so it really doesn't count" but my real brain quickly realized that a cigar would reset my badge and make me feel shitty and give me a nicotine hangover for 4 days (assuming I then quit again)

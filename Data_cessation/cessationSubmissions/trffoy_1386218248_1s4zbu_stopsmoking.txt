Quitting makes you really hate the smell?

Before I started smoking in my teens, other people's smoke never really bothered me, even in poorly ventilated  places with lots of smoke (maybe I was already addicted?). After I quit (late teens), even the faintest smell feels really disgusting and a bit overpowering... feels like I can smell it from miles away. I also had dreams of smoking, but that's apparently a normal side-effect. 

I quit for years now, the dreams are long gone but the sensitivity to the smell persists.

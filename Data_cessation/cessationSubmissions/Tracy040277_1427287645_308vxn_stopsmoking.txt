5 days smoke free 👍😀

Hi everyone, I'm new here and think this forum is very good at giving positive motivation to all who made the best choice in giving up smoking. I've been smoke free for 5 days now and my reasons for quitting are, my health.. I Have pnemonia at the moment and I'm feeling pretty rubbish, out of breath, nasty cough and quite fatigued. I've never been ill like this before, I'm only 37 and I know the reason I'm bad is because of smoking, I never want to feel like this again so it's time I started gaining control of my life and start putting 'me' first. Secondly I'm quitting because I have a 17 yr old son and a 12 yr old daughter and I want to be there for them both for as long as possible, they are my life. 
I look forward to hearing some of your stories, and tips on how to cope with cravings. 😊

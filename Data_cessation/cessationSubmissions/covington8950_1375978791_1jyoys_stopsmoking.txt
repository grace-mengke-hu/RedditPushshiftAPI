Day 5 Reflections, Questions and Advice

30 year old female who has smoked for 15 years here. Last cigarette was August 3rd. Not my first time to the rodeo. Yesterday, I had my first drink (3 beers in total) since quitting. Despite babbling about cigarettes riding cigarette-smoking unicorns at the peek of my cravings, I did not smoke! Victory 1! When can I tell my boyfriend that the irritability will end? That's by far my worst symptom so far. Lastly, I know I'm new to quitting, but a bit of advice that helped me, and has been said here before, is to quit 1 smoking habit at a time before you go cold turkey. I have 2; smoking while drinking and smoking on my walk to and from the train station for work. I quit smoking on my walks before I officially quit smoking, and it seems to have helped.

Thanks and wish me luck.

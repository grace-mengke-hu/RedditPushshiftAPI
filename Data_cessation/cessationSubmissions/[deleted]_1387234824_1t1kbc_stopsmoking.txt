Checking in at 37 days!

Hey guys I can't believe it's been 37 days since I decided to quit. It feels really good knowing that if I set my mind to it, I can accomplish anything. I couldn't have done it without this sub and without reading every one else's posts. Whether you're at day 1, 10, 100, or 1000 we're all in this together. We all help each other out in ways that we never knew we could. It's like I have a personal coach with me 24/7. So thank you.

I noticed that I get cravings at weird times. Times that if I would never think I'd get cravings. Like today, I passed my final ( with flying colors) and on the way home I wanted to light a cigarette to celebrate. Weird, last thing I would have though would be to get a craving when I was super happy. I didn't have one but it made me realize that any type of extreme emotion triggers my cravings. So I know where to watch out for cravings.

Again, felt like giving a big THANKS to everyone in this community for helping me out.

Today was my quit day!

And people are alive!

2 weeks ago, myself, my mom and my sister joined a quit smoking group which is funded by the Irish Cancer Society. The group set our quit day as October 8 which is today!


I woke up and had my final smoke. My mom gave me one of her 24 hour patches as I hadnt had time to go to the pharmacy to get my NRTs of choice.(I had a week to go but work got in the way). We took my niece and nephew to nursery school and we decided to go to the pharmacy so i would have my own supply. I chose the 16hr patches and the inhaler. I was originally going to choose the lozenges but the pharmacist said the inhaler would probably be more suited for me.


And guys, im feeling good! Apart from some dizziness and headaches from the inhaler which i know i shouldnt be using with the 24hr patch. I havent really been having any cravings but i know this is only day 1. Me and my mom have been unusually giddy today when we thought we would be moody as hell. My sister has been changing her habits at work and she seems to be craving a lot but she's pushing through it too.



I wish everyone luck in the battle against the cigarettes.

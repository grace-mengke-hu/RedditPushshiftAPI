Yesterday I saw a man get diagnosed with lung cancer

He was in his early 50's and was coming to the doctor for the first time since '88.  His wife was making him, he said.  I think he just didn't want to know what his symptoms really were.  That's how I used to act when my friends talked about lung cancer: I just didn't want to hear it.  I'd rather smoke my cigarette now and deal with that day later.  This man had been in denial for some time and I empathized with his plight.

Watching his face when the doctor broke the news was seriously intense.  He went from jocular to somber in no time flat.  His day had come, and he had to deal with the consequences.  I have never been more glad in my life to have kicked the habit (I quit eight months ago), because I don't think I could have handled the scene as a smoker.  

To everyone just starting, or looking for a little motivation to keep going: quitting smoking is one of the most rewarding things you will ever do.  It is *not* easy, and you will have horrible cravings.  Your brain will tell you anything it can to justify just one more, but you just have to hang in there.  It will pass, and life will go on.

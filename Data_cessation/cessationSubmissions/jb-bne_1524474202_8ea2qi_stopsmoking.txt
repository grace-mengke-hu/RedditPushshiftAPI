Tomorrow’s the day

Have my last cigarette ready to smoke before bed tonight. Tomorrow is day 1! 

I’ve been smoking 10 years, gradually getting heavier and heavier aside from a few short lived quit attempts (longest was about 6 weeks.) All of my quits have been ruined due to letting my guard down when drinking and having a few ciggies. I gave up drinking 9 months ago, so I hope to be in a better place to quit for good this time! 

In the past, I had my best success quitting after a week or so of NRT. (Gum works best for me.) So I’ve got a box of gum ready for me tomorrow. I’m going to try use it only when I really need it rather than just chewing constantly, but stay on it for a longer period. 

More than anything, posting here for accountability. Wish me luck :-)

Quitting today...

  Im 33 and have been smoking since I was about 13.  I was diagnosed with COPD last week and its been quite a buzzkill.  Steroid inhaler every morning and carrying a rescue inhaler everywhere I go.  I finally put on a patch before work this morning and sucked on a lozenge in the car on the way to the office.  It sucks...  I hate it...  But I have no other choice.

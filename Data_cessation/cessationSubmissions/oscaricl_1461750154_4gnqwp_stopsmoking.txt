Any hint for not falling back into smoking?

I have been smoking for many years, but I had phases though, where I stopped smoking for several months or even a year. Currently, I smoke about a pack a day. 
I know that I can stop smoking, e.g. last summer I went on a two week vacation without a single cigarette and it wasn't that hard. But coming back from holidays, I immedeatly went back to my old level. 
Now, I want to stop this nasty habit for good, and I know the initial period will be okay (I am equipped with Allan Carrs book, will read through it and have other resources).

My question to the advanced ex-smokers: Do you have some particular method what you do when the (for me: occasional but inevitable) urge to have a cigarette kicks in? Something like a particual picture/phrase/video/personal note or anything one can get out everytime when thinking about having a cigarette?

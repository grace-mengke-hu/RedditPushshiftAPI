Will my sense of smell ever return?

Recently quit smoking 90 days ago.  Smoked for 13 years.  About two years ago I lost my sense of smell.  A year ago I quit for a week and my smell came back 3 or 4 days in but I fell off the wagon.  I now have zero sense of smell after being smoke free for 90 days.  I can not smell anything at all.  Has anyone else had long term loss of smell?  Did it ever come back?  I could not find any information on the internet of someone in a similar circumstance. Any information will help.

Question: Any physical benefits you have noticeably felt after quitting?

Well, it's day 7 since I decided to quit cold turkey.  The cravings actually aren't too bad and I believe I can do this.  However, I haven't noticed anything noticeably superb as of yet. 

Out of curiosity however, what are some of the physical benefits you have noticed after quitting?  I associate myself as a heavy sleeper and I have terrible difficulty getting out of bed. I'm usually tired overall throughout the day.  The only time I feel wide awake is usually the first 2 hours after I have had my morning coffee.  After, the sluggishness and tiredness is right back at my ass again.

I often have sudden bursts of motivation and euphoria too (always after the morning coffee) and once the 2 hours is over, I heavily drop into a demotivated/depressed state.  

I've blamed it all due to the fact of me smoking and was wondering maybe if it could go away finally.  I can't say it has as of yet, but I'm still hoping. Have you had similar experiences?  Did this daily emotional roller coaster ever go away?  Do you think it's because of smoking?  I'd love to hear your opinions, thoughts, and responses.

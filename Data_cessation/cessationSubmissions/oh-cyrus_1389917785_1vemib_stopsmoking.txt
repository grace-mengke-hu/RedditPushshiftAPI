Dat Star!!!

I have made it a month and I feel I owe a lot of that to the folks on this sub.  You folks are good, supportive people that are really helping each other.  There are always kind and supportive words for the people that need to hear them the most.  I plan on being here for quite a while and watching the number in my star get bigger and bigger. And while I watch that happen, I hope that I can give others as much hope and motivation as I have been given.  Thanks and congrats to you all!

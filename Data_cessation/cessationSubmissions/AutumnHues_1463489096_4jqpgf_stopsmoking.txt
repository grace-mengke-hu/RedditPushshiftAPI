Can nicotine cause suicidal thoughts?

I stopped smoking cigarettes about a month ago. I never smoked a lot, maybe 2-3 a day, but I didn't feel like cigarettes were having a positive effect on me anymore, so I stopped cold turkey. I largely started smoking because I felt like it helped me with focusing and lessened my anxiety, but in the last year I've been extremely depressed. It got to the point where I was literally having suicidal thoughts all day every day, and was seriously considering following through with them. When I made the conscious decision to stop smoking cigarettes and went one day without them all those thoughts went away, literally overnight, and they haven't come back since. Is it possible that the nicotine was overestimating my brain and making my negative thoughts and feelings worse rather than better? Has anyone else had that kind of extreme mental effect from smoking?

Stopped Smoking and Now Going Nicotine Free.... Day 1

Hi everyone...

Here again after failing my last quit which lasted roughly a month of being nicotine free.

I'm currently using a vape but because of how shitty I feel, I'm going to stop using any nicotine and quit again.

I'm doing this for mental health reasons...alongside quitting other bad habits.

Nicotine causes me to focus, but it also causes anxiety and panic at times, and a weird pressure in my head, and a restlessness. 

I hate being addicted. I hate it.

I've decided to go nicotine free and use 0 nicotine vape juice to help with the psychological aspect of smoking...at least for the time being.

I'm going to treat myself well...I'm going to win this time...

I'm going to beat this addiction...

I am sick and tired of being a slave... I've said this plenty of times....but I'm just done....

What can I do to make this process easier? 

Please help...

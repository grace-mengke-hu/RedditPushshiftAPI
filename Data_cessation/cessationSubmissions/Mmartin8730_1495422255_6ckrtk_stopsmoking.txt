Day 6

I'm sitting here in bed, the end of my 6th day, no cigarettes. I still can't believe I've made it 6 days. This has been the hardest almost week of my life. I gave up so many times in my head, even got in the car once. But somehow I never took that last step. This feed and the stop smoking app are the reason I've gotten this far. That time I got in my car to go buy a pack I pulled this feed up on my phone and just sat there in my driveway reading everyone's updates. I just hope it starts getting better soon, I feel like a drug addict coming down.

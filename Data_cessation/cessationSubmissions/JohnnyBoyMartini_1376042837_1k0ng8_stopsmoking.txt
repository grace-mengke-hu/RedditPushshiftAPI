Brilliant work guys! This is really helping focus during the cravings. Keeps my mind busy with positive thoughts, and makes me realised how common our stories are. This comforts me in that when I feel low and weak, it's not me being weak and worthless, which can lead to giving in; it is just that the nicotine ain't nothing to fuck with and is a strong thing to fight, But it can be done. Good luck everyone! We'll do it!

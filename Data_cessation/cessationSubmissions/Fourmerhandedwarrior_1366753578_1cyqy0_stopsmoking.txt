Forgot I ever put in a badge request. Eleventy-one days later!

I feel amazing! My lungs feel huge and functional. Cilia function's definitely back in full swing, and has been clearing out all the gunk. I don't really have cravings. I can run so much farther, and catch my breath so much quicker. I feel like I build muscle faster.

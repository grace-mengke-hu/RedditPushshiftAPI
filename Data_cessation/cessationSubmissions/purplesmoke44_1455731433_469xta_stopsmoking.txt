Vance Romaine hypnotherapy session helped me quit

There is a hypnotherapist I went to see, he does seminars in theatres with groups of people.
 I went Jan 2015, quit for about a month and it was the most worst time of my life. I was miserable and all i was waiting for was an excuse to start again. Obviously, I failed and started smoking and was happy about it. 
This time, in 2016, its much easier, I wasn't exactly ready to quit, but I was sick of the smell and sick of always smoking 24/7, it was hard to be motivated or make time for anything else. 
I really think going to this seminar and really wanting to stop helped me. its been about 3 weeks and it wasn't too bad, especially compared to the emotional wreck i was last year. 
The website kinda looks like a crock of sht, but I 100% know i couldn't have done it without this. I barely even think to smoke. 
Don't get it twisted, I still sometimes wish i could smoke to take the edge off, but when really think about smoking, it wouldnt be worth how disappointed i would feel and how bad i would smell afterwards.


If you really want to quit, whether you are ready or not, check out Romaines website. Tickets are about $100 but worth it.

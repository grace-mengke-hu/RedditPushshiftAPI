Smoker of 10+ years, repeated attempts at smoking in need of help!

I have been smoking for over 10 years and am in my 20's.  I have smoked a pack a day roughly the entire decade or more that I have been smoking.  I keep smoking "my last cigarette" and have gone through multiple failed attempts at quitting.  Usually I break down utterly on the 2nd or 3rd day at quiting.  My best bout I had quitting was over the summer when I was working out at the gym, I got rather annoyed at my performance and knew that if I didn't smoke I could have more stamina working out.  This resulting in my smoking once per day, or once per every other day.  Like most smokers that cut down, I thought I was in -control-.

You can guess that after a few months that one-a-day turned back into many a day, to a pack a day.  Now my biggest problem is that ever since then, my quit smoking gusto has been ruined by my own "Today is the day!" quit and fail.  It's almost like I'm crying wolf at quitting now.

Quiting is so hard now that I read  the Allen Carr book and even failed.  I have a fear that I will be missing out on smoking even though I full well know I won't.  My mind is very strong at convincing myself that it's ok to have one and quit at a better time every day 2 of the quitting process.  I have two family members that have smoked and succumbed to the devastating effects of smoking.

Non-smokers TL:DR
How can I stop myself at day 2?  How can I stop my own brainwashing?  Should I stop crying wolf and let my slavery consume me?

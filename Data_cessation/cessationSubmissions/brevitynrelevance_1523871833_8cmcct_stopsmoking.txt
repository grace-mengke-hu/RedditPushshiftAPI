Three months in and I still think about smoking a lot

I’m at 100+ days and I’m super proud of myself. I’m committed to living smoke free. 

But I still think about smoking. A lot. Mostly when I come home after work and when I see someone on the street smoking or when I smell someone else smoking. Yes the smell of stale cigarettes is disgusting but I still like the smell of one as it’s burning. 

I’m committed to this and I know I’m not going to start smoking again. I accept that right now I need to be hyper vigilant. But I’m also really looking forward to the day when I’m disgusted by the smell of a burning cigarette, and when this all becomes a little easier. 

Of course it’s easier today than it was two months ago. But, I’m still hanging in there and it’s still hard. So to everyone else, hang in there.

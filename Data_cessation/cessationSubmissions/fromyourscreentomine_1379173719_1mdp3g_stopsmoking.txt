It helped me. "If you'll give in once, you'll give in twice." - somewhereonreddit dot com

So I am on day 3 of quitting smoking and it all started after reading that quote in the /getmotivated.  Every time I get that urge to smoke and my brain says just one more.  I tell my self if I'll give in once, I'll give in twice.  I hate giving in.  Never Again!

Alright here we go day 1.. Doing this for myself and my family

I recently Split with my girlfriend of 2 years, 5 days ago. Her dad died of smoking. I initially "quit" for her but every now and then I had a couple cancer sticks when I was drunk.  The male members of my family were and are all smokers. Grandfather had lung cancer. My dad still smokes right now, but we agreed to try to help each other quit. His habit is worse than mine, I think he goes through about half a pack a day I say. I don't really have too much of a craving,  but I realized I need to QUIT FOREVER and for good.
 I need to do this for myself and MY family. I need to break the chain that kills all the men in my lineage.

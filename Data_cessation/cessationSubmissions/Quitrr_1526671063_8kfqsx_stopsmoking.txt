I can't rewrite my memories

I have finally made it to 3 months! This is a big goal for me. On the day I quit, I told myself I will quit for 3 months and then I will re-asses. At three months I would decide if I still want to smoke. I know this is not a traditional approach, but I felt it would work for me. Now after three months I can emphatically say Not One Puff Ever (nope).
 
I could talk about all the benefits at three months and the list is long and wonderful, but it mirrors most of the awesome things that are talked about on this sub all the time.

At this time in my quit, I rarely have any cravings. If I have a craving it is mild and lasts a very short while. What is weird, is that I can't rewrite my memories. I am going out to a bar with my wife tonight and we sit out on the patio and there is smoking on the patio. It took me a while till I could re-introduce alcohol into my life, and longer to get to a point where putting myself in this situation was even an option. When I think about this place, my mind goes to ... yeah I used to smoke there. I remember that being fun. This is before my mind shift occurred and I still believed the lies about smoking. This was before I read Easy way to stop smoking by Allen Carr. I know now that a cigarette is going to do nothing good for me. One cigarette could and probably would start a destructive path to so many things I don't want in my life. Although, it still feels strange that those memories are there, but I feel differently about smoking now.

Thank you to this sub. You are all amazing, supportive, strong people. This sub is a big part of why I am still a non-smoker. If you are just starting out, it does get easier. I know it doesn't feel like it now, but it will happen. I will not smoke with you today.

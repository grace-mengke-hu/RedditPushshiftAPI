Husband lied to me and is smoking again, how do I handle this?

Apologies if this is the wrong subreddit. He quit 2 years ago because he is very physically active and he was having a hard time catching his breath. Then he started in on cigars about 6 months later and then to a pipe about 8 months ago. In December, a pack of smokes fell out of his pocket and he swore it was because he had run out of tobacco. Today I found several receipts for packs of smokes, one as recent as Friday. I'm very sad he chose to lie to me, but I love him and need to figure out a way to get through this. Those of you who have slipped, what would you want your SO to say or do to help you back to your commitment? Thanks.

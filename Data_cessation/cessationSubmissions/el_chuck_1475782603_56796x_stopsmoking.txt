It's day 11....

..and I am having the worst craving I've had since I quit. I'm at work and my staff is driving me absolutely nuts. Tons of stupid questions that these people should know the answers to, but since they don't, I have to put my own work on hold to help them out. I've basically been spinning my wheels for the past two hours. It is times like these that I would usually step out and gun a smoke. I'm sure I could rummage through my truck and find a stale Camel on the floor, or bum one from one of the many smokers here at work. But I'm not giving up yet! I actually feel better now that I've acknowledged my craving, and got this little rant out of my system. Well now that that's done back to work. Thanks for reading. 

I'd like to clarify quickly that these questions my staff has, while they seem stupid and obvious to me, are very valid to them. I acknowledge that they are asking because they want to do a good job, and not screw up. I try to be a good manager, but their 'neediness' can really wear on me. The whole not smoking thing doesn't help either. ok. i'm actually done now.

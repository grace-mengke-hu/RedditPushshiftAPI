5 days down and all I see are cigarettes, cigarettes everywhere....

Hi,

I stopped smoking on Sunday and I'm feeling great! And it's only been 5 days! The question I have for the nonsmokers is when I'm walking to work or walking around at lunch I see cigarettes everywhere. It makes me want one so damn much, it so hard to resist. Anyone have some suggestions? I wish I could just not leave my house for a month. This would be so much easier.

Thanks in advance

"I'm So Sorry Nicotine, This Just Isn't Working. It's Not You, It's Me."

Update! This was [Me] (http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1zva9i/sigh_i_need_some_help_guys/) btw. 

Well, today I got the job officially! *Woo!!!*

Last night, I also relapsed and had a pouch of my friend's snus. Then we went out drinking. Then, I had another... then, another. 

I'm making this post as a final goodbye. I can't keep going in this vicious cycle of 5 days clean, relapse, 2 days clean, relapse, 3 days clean, relapse. It's over.

This job is the start of a new me. An intelligent, college-educated, in shape, well to do professional who isn't addicted to any drug of any sort. I am better than this. I'm sick of the teeth stains, the bad breath, my heart feeling like it's beating out of my chest, the pissy moods if I don't have my 'crutch', the money wasted, and the fact that I CAN'T BEAT THIS STUPID FUCKING THING.

From this point on, it's over. Thanks for nothing. Goodbye you fucker.

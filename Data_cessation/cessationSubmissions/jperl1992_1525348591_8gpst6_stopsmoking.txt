Under insane stress, made it another day cigarette free.

Day two on the patch, low dose. Had a craving to pick up a cigarette when outside studying. Realized this fact, picked up a pack of gum, and went inside back to work. 

I take one of the biggest exams of my life in 6 weeks and am studying now 12-14 hours a day for it. Stress is high, but at least so far I haven't picked up! In an odd way, I'm really glad that the next 6 weeks are going to be cave style studying. It's going to be super helpful in terms of keeping my motivations in check and really kicking this pesky habit.

Thanks for letting me share my musings!

Ahoy Fellow Redditors! I just quit smoking. Enough is enough already. I can do this but I know I will need your help.

I am 25 and have smoked for 6 years. Ick. 
I quit just today, just now. And i am ready for my journey to a better life. 

Camel Wides Filters cost me $8.15 every 2 days here in Pennsylvania. 

I am throwing my money down the drain and ever worse harming my One and only body. Is there hope for me to return my lung health to near that of a non smoker? 

What is your number 1 tip that was most crucial for you all who have quit?

I'm nicotine free!

On 4/4 I quit cigs with the help of the patch. I had been tapering down steps on the patch about every two weeks. This past Tuesday, (5/9), was my first day on the step 3, 7mg, patch. As per usual, it was another rough translation cutting my nicotine intake out. But somehow, I just forgot to put a new patch on, on Wednesday. Friday comes around and I realize that I wasn't a raging, emotional bitch from going from 14mg to 7mg....I was a raging, emotional bitch because I accidentally cut myself off all together. 
I also went out and drank on Friday night. I got drunk for the first time in years and STILL DIDN'T SMOKE! I just feel like I've had a week of really big victories and I'm really proud of myself!

so positive here.. I make up excuses every day to postpone

Agggh,

I was very well motivated and I reduced my vaping a lot (I am not smoking cigarettes since 5 years ago).

But nothing, because I can't stand the mornings, I keep postponing every day.

Today I bought the nicotine spray, but I haven't used it yet. To be honest I don't want to get addicted to that!

It's nice to read a lot of positive posts here, but gosh I am a very bad one here keep making up excuses grrrr

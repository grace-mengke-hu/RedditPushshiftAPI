best time of day to quit?

i know this might seem like an odd question, but is it better (or easier i guess is a better way of putting it) to quit in the morning or night? i usually smoke my last cigarette around 8pm and don’t smoke my first until 10/1030am. i’m planning on using the patch when i quit and just wondered if a certain time of day to start the quit was usually more successful. ty!!!

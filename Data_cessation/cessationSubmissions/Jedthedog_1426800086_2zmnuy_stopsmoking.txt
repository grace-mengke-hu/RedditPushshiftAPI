Withdrawal symptom: itchy skin?

Hey guys! 



18 days in and going strong! I wanted to pick the brain of some of y'all... Has anyone ever had itchy skin (with no rash) as one of their withdrawal symptoms? For some reason (perhaps anxiety? I'm somewhat anxiety prone) I've started to feel itchy all over my body since about day 15. It's really annoying and I can't help thinking it's my brain playing tricks on me. 


Just wondering if anyone else has experienced this... Quitting sucks, but it's way better than smoking!

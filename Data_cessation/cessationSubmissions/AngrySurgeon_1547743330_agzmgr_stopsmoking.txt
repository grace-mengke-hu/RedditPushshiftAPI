Thank you guys!

Just checking in, and wanted to say thanks a lot to you guys . I am on day 13 of my quit, got the news that I failed my finals by 3 marks. 
Did not smoke, went for a run -8k and almost vomited when I got some second hand smoke on the pavement.
I donâ€™t know what tomorrow night entail, but today i am  thankful to god and you people for taking me through. I am proud of my actions .

I have to stop. I need help, guys.

Tonight, I watched the fireworks with my son for his first time, he's six months old. He was mesmerized! As I was holding him and watching the reflection of the fireworks in his eyes, I told him "I'll be here for you, always. No matter what."

 I just had a cigarette before bed and thought about today and what I told him. I realise I can't be here for him if I keep smoking cigarettes..

I've tried here before and it worked for a few days but I gave in. Revisiting this subreddit and commenting on a post my flair said 516 days. It's sad thinking about how long I could have been cigarette free if I had more willpower. 

My son is all the motivation in the world but it's so hard, guys. :( Any suggestions? Going to wake up in the morning and skip my first cigarette of the day, I get so crabby and I'm looking for tips or ideas to help me. Thanks!

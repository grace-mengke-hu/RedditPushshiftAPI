I need help. Don't know how to stop

Hi,
There have been a lot of problems in my life lately. This situation i have been in recently hurt me in a way I can't really describe.

I had quit for a couple of years and was doing really well. Now i feel like i basically live on cigatettes. Smoking a pack a day or more. I can't keep food down and feel really tired all the time. I want to stop but i get this anxious feeling in the pit of my stomach. That urge to just and that's the only bad feeling i can relieve right now.

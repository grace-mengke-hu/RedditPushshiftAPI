Dreams re-occurring

Every night this week I've had a dream that I smoked. It started with taking a drag and throwing the cig away to having the full smoke and then remembering that I quit over 6 months ago. Regardless, I felt like shit in my dreams after smoking and I could even taste how bad they were. Man was I relieved when I woke up. Funny thing is I haven't had a craving in over 2 months now. Just thought I'd share.

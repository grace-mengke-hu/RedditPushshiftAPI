I need my G/F to stop smoking. What can I do to help?

Edit:

On reflection, this post was stupid and insensitive.  The strong responses on here have me rethinking my intentions.

I should have asked for ways to support my girlfriend while she's trying to quit - which is actually what the situation is. 

In any case, good luck with your respective struggles with this.

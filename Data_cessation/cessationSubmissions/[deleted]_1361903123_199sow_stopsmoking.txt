One day down, four or five decades to go.

I'm in the Midwest, in one of the worst spots for this second round of snowstorm. A couple days ago I'd stocked up on cigarettes, knowing I wouldn't be able to leave to get any for at least a few days.

Yesterday I was smoking my brains out all morning, watching it alternate between kind of snowing and really snowing, and noticed I was feeling really sick. This happens when I absent-mindedly chain smoke. So then, I decided to take advantage of these couple snow days. I destroyed all my cigarettes, threw away all my lighters and ash trays and anything that reminds me of smoking. I have nothing to smoke and no way to go get something to smoke.

It's been about 24 hours now. My chest is tight as hell and my ribs hurt. I don't know if that's in any way relevant to not smoking or if it's something else entirely. Either way, doesn't matter. If I can get through a few days I know I can for real, seriously quit. I've "quit" smoking for almost a day at a time like twenty times in the last year. I never make it past a day. This time I have no choice. So here I go again. I hope it sticks this time.

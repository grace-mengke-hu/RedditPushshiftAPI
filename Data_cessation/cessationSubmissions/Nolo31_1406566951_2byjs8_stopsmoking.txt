This is it!

I've been a smoker for 8 years (28 now). During that time I have varied between half a pack all the way to 2 packs a day. Currently about half a pack.

  I mostly smoke at work. During the evening and on weekends, I have very few cigarettes and instead use my e-cig.

  I've been wanting to quit for a while; however, I really enjoy smoking. Finally decided the juice isn't worth the squeeze and I am bound and determined to quit. I have 3 cigarettes left. They will be the last 3 that I smoke. I will use my e-cig only at home. I will justify this as a reward for making it through the work day without a normal cigarette. I eventually want to quit that too.

  Do you guys see a problem with my plan? Any suggestions like situations or thoughts to avoid? Thank you so much!

  **Edit: Just threw my remaining two smokes and my lighter in the trash. LETS DO THIS!**

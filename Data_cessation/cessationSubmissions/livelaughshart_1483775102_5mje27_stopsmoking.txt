Really having a hard time quitting (shocker, I know)

So I used to dip back in the day; for a few years, then I went to ecigs to stop putting poison in my lip.  Somehow I felt that putting garbage in my lungs was a smoother move.  Anywho, I don't want to do this anymore.  A lot of the threads I read are all about the smell, yellow teeth, and all the other bad things that come with smoking cigarettes.  After roughly a year of vaping and I've experienced none of those awful effects.  Here's the problem, I don't want to put anymore garbage in my body, but every time I try, I'm easily able to convince myself that 1 it's not that bad, it's vapor, 2 nobody will ever notice in the foreseeable future, and 3 it's relaxing and takes any personality ticks I think I have away.  I can escape to the restroom during an important business meeting, "reset," and people are none the wiser.  I don't want to always think about how much juice I have left or where I can refill or when I can sneak off to take a drag.  Any tips to get me out of this nonsense?  I've tried the patches, gum, and mints, but each time I figure the NRTS are no different than the vapor.  Any and all suggestions would be really helpful.  Thank you.

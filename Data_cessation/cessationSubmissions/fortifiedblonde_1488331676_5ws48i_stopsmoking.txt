Day 2 - training for a half marathon to keep me on the straight and narrow!

Hello all!

I am 33 and have been smoking for 17 years. I have been "weaning down" for at least a year now - only smoking if I'm drinking, generally smoking 2-10 cigarettes a week, occasionally going for a week or two or three without.

But that's all half-assed nonsense.  I've been slowing down because I HATE smoking and am over it and done with it. I've been consciously winding down but I need to get it out of my system completely and forever.

So in conjunction with getting a personal trainer and signing up for a half marathon (12 more weeks!), I'm going to do my best to walk the fuck away from cigarettes.  For real this time.

I decided my "Jesus Year" (I'm not religious but I really dig the term in this context) will be the year that I stop being overweight, stop being lazy, and start pursuing a ton of goals I've had building for a while.  I moved to the Rocky Mountain region to backpack and hike and climb mountains and run trails and this smoking slovenly stuff is not how it's going to become reality.

So there's all that.  I just kinda ranted.  I'm looking forward to continuing to change my life for the better in as many ways as I can.

If anyone has any advice as to how to best incorporate recuperating lungs into longer cardio workouts - or any other advice - I'd love to hear it.

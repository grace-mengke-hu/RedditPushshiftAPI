Only two weeks in. Very little energy or enthusiasm.

I have a question about quitting smoking that I haven't seen addressed anywhere. I've managed to not smoke in the last two weeks and overall, I've been doing better than I expected. 

I've sort of gotten to the point that I let things roll off my back more because I don't consider smoking a cigarette an option to ease my stress. So my lows aren't as low, but my highs aren't really as high either. Smoking a cigarette was something to look forward to and get excited about and now I don't have that. Overall, my mood's more stabilized, but it's pretty blas√©. I feel physically and mentally lethargic. I don't know if I should expect this to last and try my best to adjust, or if it's something that'll basically take care of itself eventually.

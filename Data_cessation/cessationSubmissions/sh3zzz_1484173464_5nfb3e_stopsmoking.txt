Survived a fight with my SO

Stupid fight, probably exacerbated by my quitting crankiness. I had the huge urge to just say fuck it and light up, but resisted it and reminded myself I'm past that now, it's not going to actually help in any way and will probably just make me feel more tense anyway. Plus I don't want to face days 1-4 again!

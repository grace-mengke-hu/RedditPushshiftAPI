1 year

Hello gals and guys!

I just want to report that yesterday I celebrated my first anniversary of being smoke free!

When I quit last year I wasn't sure if I could make it. I quit cold turkey and it was quite hard. This subreddit helped me a few times when I had a bad phase. And the good thing is that the periods between bad phases get longer quickly! (It doubled every time, I was struggling two weeks in, four weeks, two months, four month and the last problematic phase was eight months in. Each phase was approximately a week).

At the moment I rarely think about smoking and I have no cravings. That said I'm still convinced that I would start again if I smoked even a single cigarette!

At first I didn't acknowledge the positive things about being a non-smoker, but now I can enjoy things like not having to leave a fun conversation to have a smoke and things like that.

To be constructive I want to share my personal recipe to stop: tell people you look up to that you are going to stop. I needed a little bit of pressure like that and it helped me to not want to disappoint them (and more importantly myself).

So I want to thank all of you people on this subreddit and wish everyone the best of luck!

(I hope I could get my point across, I'm not a native speaker)

Greetings

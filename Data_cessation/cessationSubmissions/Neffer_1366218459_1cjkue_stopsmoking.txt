Stressful day

Hi guys, just coming to have a little winge to be honest, I quit over nine months ago now and it's very rare that I experience any cravings at all (yes it is possible :)). Today I had an interview for university, my top choice university too, I did my interview and CRB checks (I'm applying for a nursing degree and a CRB is basically a previous convictions check for Brits) they told me it would be around a month before I know and I left the building. That first step I took from the building all I could think was cigarette, this evil little scummy troll voice in my head screaming and begging for nicotine. I haven't smoked and I'm calming down now even though I have a long time to wait. Just trying to keep positive and not smoke. 

Thanks for reading I don't know if it's a positive post or a negative one if I'm being honest, I am feeling positive, about smoking if nothing else.

TL;DR Ex smoker had a scary day, craving but not smoking :/

Round 2.

I posted here about the *one cigarette* that got me back in.  I've sorted myself out and am back on the horse.  Listening through Alan Carr and getting that "excited to quit" feeling he talks about.  I really was so much happier and healthier, and I am glad to be back on my way.  Quitting at the end of the book, and no more *just one*'s.  I'm on track to finish it on my commute tomorrow, that'll be day one (part duex: "The Business"). 

Thanks you, beautiful people.

Done being stupid about this.

Hi folks, I'm a 22 year old guy from the north of Scotland. I've been smoking since I was 16, really kicked off regularly (around 10 a day) around 18 when I went to university. I suppose I'm mainly typing this to explicitly set out how stupid the decision not to stop smoking is on any given day. I've had a couple of streaks lasting up to 2 months over the last few years and many, many more moments of "I'm quitting this" followed by a cathartic throwing away of the cigarettes only to start again in the next couple of days.

It's a controlling habit in the most sinister way. 
It wrecks your ability to have freedom of choice throughout your day. It cripples you. The health horrors it can bring are something we know about but don't really truly consider thoughtfully often enough. So this is to not picking up the habit again.

I hope you're with me, and stay strong and take your life day by day. Cheers and good luck to all who hope for a better tomorrow for themselves - those quickly become better todays.

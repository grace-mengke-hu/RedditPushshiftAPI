day 27....what the fuck

i've been doing real well in terms of not having cravings/or having weak ones.
Right now, I can't even say I'm craving a cigarette, but i have an extra ball of stress rolling around today for no apparent reason.  

Semester ended yesterday, and having a relatively easy day at work - not sure why im so pent up - hoping that its withdrawal.  

anyone else go through this?

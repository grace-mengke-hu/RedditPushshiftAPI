My story in smoking

I was 19 when I started. I wanted to know what the big deal was about. I found my sister's parliaments, which she had stowed away in order to attempt to quit (apparently it helped her in some way to know that they were there.) When I lit up, I really wanted to smoke a joint, but I settled for the more addictive substance. With the first puff, I knew I was addicted. I had been exposed to cigarettes for years being around my sister who smoked since about 16. Now I am 26. Last year I quit in the most difficult time of my life. I was accompanying my sister and my mom to visit our oldest sister in the hospital after she experienced her second major psychiatric crisis, where she was admitted against her will. On November 11th, my niece's birthday, we drove 3 + hrs each way so that my sister could see her daughter on her daughter's birthday. When I returned from the visit, I gave the rest of my pack to a friend. I told myself that if I could quit during that difficult time, I could stay quit.

But that did not last, and the shame surrounding my relapse is incredible. In August I relapsed after the end of a relationship. I lost a love that had helped me in learning to heal. Despite his attempts, I never felt good enough for the relationship. I think that I sabotaged it unconsciously, unable to deal with my deep insecurities that have plagued me since I can remember.

My niece's birthday is coming up again, and it is my new quit date.
I don't feel ready to do it yet, and I feel right now that cigarettes are the only thing holding me together.
In having dealt with an eating disorder since the age of 13- I tell myself that smoking is the solution to not binging and purging, which had reared it's ugly head during the year that I did quit. 

How does one learn to break through the isolation and shame surrounding smoking??

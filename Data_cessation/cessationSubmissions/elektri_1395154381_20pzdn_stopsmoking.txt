Can somebody identify a problem i have with my throat?

So basically i consantly feel like i have something in my throat and it won't go away when swallowing. That makes me do those little coughs every once in a while to try to clear the throat so i can swollow. It feels like spit or i don't know. I don't like it and it's annoying.

I was wondering what causes it? Is it just that the throat is irritated with too much smoking or can it be something more serious? Specifically.

It's hard for me to describe it since english is my second language, but maybe someone gets what i'm saying.

Why this subreddit? Well if this is something serious, i have to quit obviously. Else i wouldn't because i like smoking.

Thank you in advance!

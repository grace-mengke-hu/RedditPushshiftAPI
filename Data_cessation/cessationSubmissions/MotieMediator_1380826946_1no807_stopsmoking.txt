Day one

I've been smoking for about 7 years, today's day one no smoking.  It's been about 12 hours since my last smoke.  I'm using chantix to help me through.  I've had many failed attempts in the past (like a whole lot), but this time feels right.  

So far it's been pretty easy honestly, I think I really want it this time.  I've been down the other roads so many times now I know exactly how I'll feel (a pleasant mix of shame, disappointment and self loathing) if I light up "just one".  And thanks to the chantix I know it won't even feel good.

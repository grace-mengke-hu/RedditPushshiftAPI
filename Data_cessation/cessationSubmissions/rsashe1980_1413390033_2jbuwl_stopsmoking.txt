I need help, I need a cigarette smoke detector that doesn't cost $300 that works.

My landlord of 13 years is threatening to evict me after she make the building non-smoking. I haven't smoked in 4 months but the woman that lives above me keeps saying she smells smoke.  The land lord told me THE ONLY option is to get a detector.  Can not afford to move right now. Any suggestions?

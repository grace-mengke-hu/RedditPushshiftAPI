All the help I can get!!

So I’ve smoked for over 20 years. Past few, I’ve felt a lot of anxiety over past failed attempts to quit. A couple days ago, I had a cat scan for a mass in my throat. I’ve tried everything I know to quit, however nothing has led to success. It’s a love/hate habit. I hate that my three boys see me doing this to my body, and yet I continue to do it. Please help! Any and all advice and pointers will be very much appreciated

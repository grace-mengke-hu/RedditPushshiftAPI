14 glorious days

2 weeks!  It seems that my systems have accepted that I will/can not smoke any longer.  Cravings have become much more managable.  I have been eating more than normal, not sure if this is self-imposed replacement therapy, or I can simply better afford to by more food.  Probably a combination of both, heh.  A temporary spike in body weight is much more appealing than all the negative attributes one picks up from smoking.  Just wanted to pop in a quick note for the milestone, and to say thanks for all the advice & encouragement!

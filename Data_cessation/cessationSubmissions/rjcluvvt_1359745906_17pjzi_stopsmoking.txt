Day 2 - I want to punch a Baby

This is the longest I've gone for a real long time with out a smoke! I'm just so anxious. I have no intention to smoke. I don't want to anymore. It's ridiculous how I'm acting right now. I can't believe I had let nicotine/ cigarettes affect me like this. As much as I'd love to have a cigarette, I'm only postponing the healing ..... man fuck cigarettes!

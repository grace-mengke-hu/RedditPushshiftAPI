Problems at 2 weeks.

Hey.

I'm 2 weeks into stopping smoking cold turkey. I've found that since about week 1, severe mood swings are becoming the norm.

I feel down, then really happy, then anger, like the most pure anger you could imagine. That, and I can't stop thinking about smoking. I also literally can't spend ANY amount of time with other people without starting to find them irritating.

Can anyone help? At this point I almost feel like smoking is the best thing to do. I'd rather do that than sit here being mental.

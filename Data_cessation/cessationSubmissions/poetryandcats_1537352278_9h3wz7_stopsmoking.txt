Made it to the double digits! Woo!

Day 10 starts today! Definitely am stoked that I stoked those nasty things, though I do still get the occasional craving. Its annoying, because it feels like a "choice". The ol' "oh I'll just have one" type mind trap I guess.

Not gonna happen! Stay strong out there!

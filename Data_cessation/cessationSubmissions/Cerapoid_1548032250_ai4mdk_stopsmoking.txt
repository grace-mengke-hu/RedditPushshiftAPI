It's over. I just smoked after a 20 day quit, and it was disgusting. I want to end it for life.

How can I continue to smoke when it made me feel sick, lazy, grumpy - almost immediately.

It must surely be the nicotine and not an actual wanting for the smoke right?

FK these things, they are the devils work i swear

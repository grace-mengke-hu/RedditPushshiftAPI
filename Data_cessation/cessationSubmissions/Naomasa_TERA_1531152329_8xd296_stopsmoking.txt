Day 15, we can do it!

I'm 27 and smoked for the last 13 years a pack a day, yes you read that right, i was smoking almost a pack a day since i was 14 years old.

I quit smoking cold turkey 15 days ago and I'm still feeling depressed and nauseous every day, but I'm not giving in, and you also shouldn't.

I know there are people here who smoked twice as long as I have, but it is never too late to win against this addiction, every week without smoking is a good week, never give up this fight!

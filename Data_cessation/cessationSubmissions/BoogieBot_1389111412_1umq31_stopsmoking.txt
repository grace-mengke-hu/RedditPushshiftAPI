One year

I missed my one year! Oops. I resolved to quit smoking in 2013, relapsed for a few days, got the flu, and quit altogether. Took a drag off someone else's smoke at a party in January 2013, but that was the last time I put a cig to my lips.


Ya'll, I feel amazing. Keep it up, new year quitters! I promise it gets easier.

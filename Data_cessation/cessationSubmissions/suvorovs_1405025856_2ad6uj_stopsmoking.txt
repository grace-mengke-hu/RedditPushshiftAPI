Month 2 was a lie.

At times, I go through most the day without thinking about it. Other times, I wake up to really specific and detailed nightmares of smoking, I feel nothing but regret while smoking in the dream however and wake up feeling nervous and anxious. At times, I just want to smoke, simply just because. And my chronic smoker's cough is back despite having quit and stopped hacking and coughing a month ago. 

I was told that the 2nd month usually helped rid of the addiction. But in my case it has only become erratic and aggravated. Can anyone else share their 2nd month experience? Is this normal?

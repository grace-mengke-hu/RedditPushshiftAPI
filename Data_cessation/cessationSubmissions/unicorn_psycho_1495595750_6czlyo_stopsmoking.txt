Hiya, almost 48 hours without a cigarette. Today I bought some patches. Any experience with nicotine replacement would help!

Overall it's been a hectic day, but I feel as if I conquered a great achievement by throwing my cigarettes out of the window. I'm curious to know what I'm in for with nicotine replacement 

Edit: thanks for all your experiences ! I'm heading in a 3 week long vacation with my boyfriend (and I don't smoke in front if him) so I think that'll do the trick!!

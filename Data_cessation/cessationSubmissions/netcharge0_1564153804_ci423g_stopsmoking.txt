I’m sure it was just a coincidence....

I decided to quit about three weeks ago.  Did ok for a week, then had a beer and relapsed.  Got back on the wagon the next day and had been doing ok.   Three days ago, I relapsed and within in an hour or so had a heart attack and had to be rushed to the hospital.   I’m on my way home now and believe me, I am not wanting another cigarette

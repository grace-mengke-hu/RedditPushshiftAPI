Sleep Deprived

I am a week in quitting fags. Life is all sunshineâ€™s and rainbows. For the most part of it, till it gets to night. Sleeping seems to be always difficult. I have tried 5-HTP, heavy carb meals but results have proven futile. 

I guess this is more of a waiting game but what else can I do to ensure my work productivity stays intact during this period? Hmm...

How to get through the first day?

I've been meaning to quit for awhile, but just the thought of quitting makes me want to smoke more. Day after day I keep telling myself that today will be the day I quit, but end up disappointing myself. I just don't know how people have the will power and motivation to keep it going. Any advice would be wonderful.

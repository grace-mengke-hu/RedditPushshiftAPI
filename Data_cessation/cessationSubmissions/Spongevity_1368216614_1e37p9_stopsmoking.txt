Addiction explained as a simple metaphor.

Cigarette addiction is like a fire.

Every time you smoke a cigarette, it's like you put another piece of wood onto the fire.

A fire doesn't die unless you stop adding wood.

When you stop adding wood, the fire doesn't die instantly from just that.

Craving is the feeling of the fire growing weaker.


EDIT: Clarity.

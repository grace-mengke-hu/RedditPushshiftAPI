Finally a real test and I passed.

I am visiting a friend this weekend and ended up at an outdoor music festival surrounded by smokers of all sorts. I didn't know the band, nor did I know anyone other than my friend, but I made it hours in the situation without smoking. 

There were a couple times I wanted to, but I quickly talked myself out of it. The streak continues.

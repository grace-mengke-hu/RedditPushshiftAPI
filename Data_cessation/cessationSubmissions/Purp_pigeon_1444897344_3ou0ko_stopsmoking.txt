1 Year !

Didn't want to miss this opportunity to tell you guys a few thoughts on putting.

First of all once you actually constantly fantasize about the idea of stopping , you are already past the first step ! 

The first month will be a grind but pull through , even if you fail try again and try again. I relapsed 5 times in my first 3 months always smoking one then quitting again for 3 weeks then having one more. 
Eventually you will break this cycle.

Almost every smoker that has successfully quit will tell you guys that smoking was the most stupid thing they have done in their life.

I now am one of them! 

Good luck to everyone but really when I say you can do it I honestly mean it !

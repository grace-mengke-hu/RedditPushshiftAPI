I Bought a Pack

33 days now. I almost gave up on day 32. 

Had a little too much to drink last night. Bought a pack at a store when my friends weren't looking. Luckily(?) I felt the need to confess before I opened it and they talked some sense into me and I handed it over. 

I can't help but wonder how long it will be before I can grab a few drinks and not think about cigarettes. How long will it be before I get stressed and not have the first split-second thought be cigarettes?

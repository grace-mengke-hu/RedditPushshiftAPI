So stoptober begins tommorow...

Ive made all my prep, tried to quit last october using nicotine aids and failed so this year I'll be trying basic cold turkey! Feeling nervous about it already which isnt a good sign. Plenty of reasons to give it up though, moved up to basically a twenty pack a day habit and it has to stop! Any advice reddit?

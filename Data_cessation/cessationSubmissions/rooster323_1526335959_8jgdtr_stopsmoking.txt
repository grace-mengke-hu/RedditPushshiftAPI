Anyone used to smoke dokha who quit?

I grew up in Dubai and got hooked on dokha when i was 13, I'm 19 now and i've decided it's time to quit. Anyone who's smoked dokha knows that buzz or rush it gives you especially in the morning which is why I think I'm going to have a hard time quitting. I never smoked cause it was cool or social or relaxing or helped me concentrate I smoked for the rush, because I love that feeling. It's going to be hard to let go of that and never feel that sensation again so I'm asking others who succeeded on quitting how they got over the fact that they will never have another morning buzz from a morning bowl (or cigarette) again.

Hey r/stopsmoking. It's been 4 days since my last cigarette and my head is pounding.

I'm 22 years old and had been smoking ~10 cigarettes/day on and off for a couple years. I'm on the nicoderm CQ patch (started with step 2) but I have a headache that won't quit and ALL I can think about is lighting up. What am I in for here? How much worse will it get before it gets better? This is rough

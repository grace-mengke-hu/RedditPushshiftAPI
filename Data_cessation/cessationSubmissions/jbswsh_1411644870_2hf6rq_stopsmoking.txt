Hi guys, I am looking for help to stop smoking. :)

Hi r/stopsmoking,

my name is Julius and I have been smoking since I was around 14. I am 20 years old now. I really want to quit smoking. The prices are getting out of hand I would want to spend my money on different activities. I started smoking to cope with my depressive tendencies as a teenager. Now I feel I can handle them much easier and smoking is just a remnant of the past. I am looking for tips to lower my daily smoking and quit out right. I can take a couple of days easily without a cigarette but after that I usually go back to my old amount of about 7 to 10 cigs a day. What would be the best course of action to take if I want to quit for good? Also is it normal that people post here to get mental encouragement? Because sometimes I feel like that is what i lack the most. 

Cheers.

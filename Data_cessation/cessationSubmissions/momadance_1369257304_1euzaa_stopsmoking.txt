First day! This is hard.

It is my first day of not smoking.  Not having a cigarette in the car on the way to work was the worst.  Not having a cigarette on my afternoon break was the worst.  I'm sure the drive home from work will be hard too.  But I'm 30 now and it's time I quit.  I've been smoking since I as about 15 years old.  Half my life.  I'm done.  But, this is hard.

Does this count?

So two weeks ago I had to borrow a family members car. Naturally, I couldn't smoke in it. Since my pack was empty anyway and I couldn't do my hour commute without nicotine I just bought an e-cig. Tomorrow will be two full weeks of being cigarette free because of the ecig. The only problem is I don't feel like I've accomplished anything. I feel better. I no longer smell. I dont even crave real cigs anymore, they actually kind of disgust me now.  Best of all though I don't go insane if I have to go extended periods without vaping. Basically, nicotine isn't controlling my life now, just kind of hanging out with it. I feel like I've cheated in that regard. Can I still say I've quit if I'm vaping?

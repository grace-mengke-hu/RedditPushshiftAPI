I want to quit smoking but i don't know how

I've been smoking for about 5 years know and i'm sick of it. I've tried a lot of stuff but always failed and it's really depressing me. My mom smoke too, so when i'm really trying I come home and I just get hit with this cloud of smoke immediately. I know she won't quit smoking if I don't do it first. So what you guys recommend me to do?

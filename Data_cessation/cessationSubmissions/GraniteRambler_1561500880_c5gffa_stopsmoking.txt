I found a loophole!

So, I thought some of you might find this funny and perhaps useful. I quit tobacco 1+ month ago, and my Juul over 2 weeks ago. This weekend was my first time partying without nicotine, and the cravings were hitting me hard. I discovered that if I had my girlfriend take a fat, crackly Juul hit right into my ear while I sucked in as if *I* taking a hit, it tricked my brain into giving me a rush. Not *as* good as the real thing, but better than the guilt of going back to smoking. 
 
Anyway, what other weird tricks have you found? One friend recommended flavored toothpicks; another suggested taking "smoke breaks" to just suck in air through a straw. What has worked for you?

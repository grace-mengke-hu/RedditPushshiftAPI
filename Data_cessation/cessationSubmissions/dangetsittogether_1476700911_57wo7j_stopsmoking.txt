Okay, Monday morning commute. This is my first major hurdle.

So like every red blooded smoker, I smoked in my car in the way to work. This morning is going to be the first morning in a while that I don't smoke. The kids are playing nicely right now so that's making it easier, but I still have to get them dressed for school. They're so difficult about it sometimes that it makes me want to smoke.

But! As has been discussed in a previous thread, its not them that makes me want to smoke, it's me. I can indeed overcome this urge by separating the cause from the supposed effect, because I stand in between them.


update: fuck yeah. made it to the office. time to code.

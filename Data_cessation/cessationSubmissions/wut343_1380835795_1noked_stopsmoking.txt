19 days smoke free...feel awful

So I smoked for around 4/5 years. I quit 19 days ago, just went cold turkey and haven't smoked since. But fucking hell, this is tough! I knew it would be tough and the worst part is, I'm not even craving a smoke. I have been out drinking a couple of times and haven't smoked then either. It's just the withdrawal symptoms are pretty awful! Here is what I have experienced/what I am experiencing so far:

Allergies: I think I have become more sensitive to dust. Every couple of days I sneeze a lot, eyes get itchy, nose becomes itchy and runs. I'm assuming this is to do with dust allergies or something.

Sleep: Sleep is pretty shitty. I wake up every couple of hours, sometimes I don't get much sleep at all.

Nausea: Currently experiencing this and this is after 19 days. Just a general unwell feeling.

Dizziness: This is a bit of a weird one. But I definitely feel a lot dizzier since I quit smoking, it has only started since I stopped. Again, I have no idea why this would be happening after 19 days?!.

Anxiety: This is also pretty bad.

There are more side effects but they're the main ones for me. I'm glad I quit, I really am. And I don't have any physical cravings for a cigarette but the worst thing is knowing that all this will go away if I just have a smoke. But there's no way in hell I am going through this again so fuck that! I wish I never even started.

Has anyone had similar symptoms to me though? Such as the nausea and dizziness?

Decided 3 days ago it was time

Long story short, I've been a smoker for 15 years, roughly a pack a day. Today is day 3 of my journey (cold turkey quitting) and the cravings aren't as bad as I thought they'd be. But I feel tomorrow night (Saturday night) will be a true test to me. Alcohol and cigs pretty much go hand and hand and I will be at a bar for friends birthday. Wish me luck!

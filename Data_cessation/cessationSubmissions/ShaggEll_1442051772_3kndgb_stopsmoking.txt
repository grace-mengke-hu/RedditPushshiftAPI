quitting smoking today..........

I know a lot of people won't understand this but I don't know what to do. There was a point in my life where I had next to nothing. I was on the verge of suicide. I felt nothing for anyone or anything. The lights were off. The thought of happiness was distant and cold.  I wanted nothing but to be done with this world and the people in it. I know I haven't lived the hardest life out there. I was just through trying to find my way. Trying to figure out what I wanted. Suicide was my goal. To feel was a distant thought. The thought, oh the thought of hope for me was a nightmare. I reaching for the sky and was drowning. The sunrises were dark and nights were cold. Then I bought my first pack of cigarettes. I still wanted to die but I wasn't sure. I wasn't sure if I was the one to do it. I wasn't sure anymore if I could. It has been eight years since I have started. I know that's not long for most people. I have watched my family fall apart. I have seen and helped loved ones be put into bags. With a heavy heart and a cigarette in my mouth I helped push my father through the snow after I said goodbye. His body temperature was warmer in a bag above the snow then my hand. The hand I brushed his face with saying goodbye. I know this is selfish, this is cold, this is only MY pain. To me cigarettes have become a part of me. A lifestyle, even an icebreaker in college. But still a wall, a wall of comfort. I was a track athlete before I started smoking. I grew up with asthma. I was born with asthma. I never thought I would ever start smoking. I never thought my life would come to where it has. I can only say I'm tired of wanting. I'm TIRED OF NEEDING!!!

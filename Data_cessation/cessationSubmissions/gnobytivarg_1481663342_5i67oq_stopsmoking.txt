1000 days seems impossible

After a kind redditor messaged me to congratulate me on my milestone I thought I'd make a post. At first it seems like 1000 days without a smoke is unreachable but then after a while, you stop counting the days and life goes on.  It does get easier....... never give up, your stronger than the addiction. GL all!

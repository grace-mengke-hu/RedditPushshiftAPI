I smoked my last cigarette on Valentine's day!

Hi everyone,

I decided to smoke my last cigarette on Valentine's day and haven't smoked since (cold turkey). I never thought I'd make it past the first few hours but here I am. I had been smoking about a pack a day and sometimes more (e.g. when drinking) for the past 10 years.

Just posting here to encourage others and hold myself accountable. I still constantly feel cravings (especially at work) and feel there's a lump in my throat (similar to when you are about to cry). 

Anyways, I'm only on day 3 and I hear it's going to get better eventually.

Stay strong everyone!

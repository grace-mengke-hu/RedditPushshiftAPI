Back in the saddle again!

Today is the day. I have quit many times over the years (longest streak being 2yrs). I am ready to make it stick this time for my myself and my family. I have been lurking here the last few days and I already appreciate you guys. I hate the idea of just making it a new years resolution but it falls about the time I wanted to quit anyway. So here's to moving forward and becoming a non smoker again!

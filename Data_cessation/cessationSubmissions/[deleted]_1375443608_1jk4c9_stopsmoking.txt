Locking myself in my house....will this help or make it harder?

So, failed to quit again, getting pretty desperate now. Done patches, Allen Carr, gum, cold turkey....nothing is sticking as yet.

The only thing I have left is to destroy my bank card after stocking up on food and things...and locking myself in my house for a week.

Half of me thinks this is the only option left, forcing myself into a sort of cold turkey rehab scenario whilst obsessing over this sub reddit and catching up on my chores. But the other half, thinks this may make the psychological withdrawal a million times worse.

What say you quitters?

What do you think; does smoking a joint count as a cigarette?

I've been smoking for the last 7 years, and decided I wanted to quit. I smoked 1 pack (19 cigarettes here in The Netherlands) per day, each day (some days more, some days less). Besides cigarettes, I occasionally smoke cannabis (2/3 times a week); where I mix weed/hasj with some tabacco.

What do you think; does a joint (cannabis) count as smoking a cigarette? Keep in mind that I'm planning to stick with the *occasional* joint; 2/3 times a week. No more. 

[edit]

Thanks for all the advice people! I'm going to lay off the weed (at least a month) for a while and try to find a substitute for the tobacco. [You all get upvotes!](http://i.imgur.com/hwIfn.jpg)

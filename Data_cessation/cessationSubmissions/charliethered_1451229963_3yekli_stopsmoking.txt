Smoking nightmares/dreams

Hi guys,

I just hit 20 days of cold turkey.  So far so good ... I've put on a few pounds and noticed a huge difference in my circulation.  I also have pretty bad gas.  I described the physical effects of quitting to a coworker: I feel like the glue that was holding my body together has come apart, even though it was toxic and killing me.  Now I have to learn how to take care of my body without it.

The real problem I'm having is dreams/nightmares.  I smoked for 15 years, and I'm 30 ... so half my lifetime.  I guess it's become an extension of my body.  Anyone else have dreams where they're smoking, suddenly feel guilty for having fallen off the wagon, and then wake up realizing you didn't smoke?  Those are the days when I'm getting the absolute WORST cravings.  It's like I wake up feeling like I just smoked a cigarette and that I should go get another one.

They almost remind me of dreams that amputees have, where their amputated limb is still attached in the dream.  Anyone else experience this?

I don't think it will cause me to start smoking again, but I thought it was a pretty weird experience that maybe someone else is having.

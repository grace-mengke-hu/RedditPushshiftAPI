Reset my badge. I'm back in the game and better than ever.

I had well over a year clean before I had a run of bad luck and let the beast back into my life. It took a year to gather my life up and be ready to start again. I never unsubscribed here and kept all your posts in my feed to help get the motivation to quit again.

Had my last one exactly 7 days ago and I'm somehow over the physical withdrawal. And this time I'm going in with concrete proof that even after 16 months clean, one drunk smoke with a friend will drop me right back into a pack a day. 

So happy I'm back in the ranks of the clean breathing. I really needed to have gotten my relapse shame off my chest and out of my lungs.

We're all gonna make it yo.

2 days without a cigarette, starting day 3

Last Sunday night was the night I said to myself 'No more'. After 10 years smoking I quit, the last months have been my top, consuming about 15 cigarettes a day. 

So far it has been easy, I'm not craving for a cigarette and I really increased water intake, from 1 or 2 regular 600 ml cokes to 2.5 liters of water, I've heard the 3rd day is the most difficult but I feel very optimistic, I will make it and will leave this disgusting addiction for good.

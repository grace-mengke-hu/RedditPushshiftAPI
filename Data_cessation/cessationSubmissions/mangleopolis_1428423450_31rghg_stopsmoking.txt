What do you do when things go wrong?

For two years now, my default response to bad days has been to go have a cigarette, and it's tricked me into believing that it calmed me down/cleared my head. Now, though, as a non-smoker, I really don't know how to respond when life goes poorly. What does a normal, non-self-destructive response look like?

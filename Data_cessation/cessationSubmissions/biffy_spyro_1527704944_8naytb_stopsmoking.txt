One week in, feeling it today!

Hey folks, this time last week I went for hypnotherapy to stop smoking and its actually working! I was completely skeptical of it but it's definitely given me the push I've needed.

I smoked for 20 years since I was 15, it's weird trying to find something to do on my breaks at work etc as I'm so used to just going out for a smoke.

Today I'm really struggling though and thinking about smoking every 10 minutes! Anyone got any tips? I think it's because I have the place to myself today and I'm hammering the housework with a wee drink and usually I'd be jumping out for a cig every hour or so. Unsure why this is getting to me more than watching my smoking buddies at work go out without me!

I've been told to get myself something nice with my smoking money at 3 weeks and I really want to but today is torture.

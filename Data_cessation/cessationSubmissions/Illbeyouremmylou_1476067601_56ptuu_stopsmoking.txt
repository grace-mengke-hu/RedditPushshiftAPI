Help!

Hi everyone,
My badge isn't accurate, I'm still smoking. I think I made it 5 days last time, and I actually had a complete breakdown. I quit cold turkey once before, lasted 6 months! that was a few years ago. After several failed attempts since, I'm starting to think cold turkey isn't going to fly. I've tried the pills, lets just say never again for those.  
I'm 57 days alcohol free, i'm not your stereotypical alcoholic but I can't drink like most people.  What are some tips for quitting? How do you know it's the right time?

Another "Allen Carr" success story - Free after 10 silly 10 years.

I'm a month in to my life as a non-smoker and have really valued all the other success stories I've been reading here everyday -- they've served as a timely reminder as to why I should battle any craving every morning.

I smoked for 10 years (from 13 - 23), about 20 a day, sometimes more like 30 - 40 as I've lived as an expat in Asia for a while where cigarettes are practically "free".

Took me a year from deciding I hated myself for being a smoker to actually put out the last one and say enough is enough but I've done it and thanks to Allen Carr I've not really come that close to caving.

The biggest change for me was that I wanted to be a non-smoker more than I wanted another cigarette. That's ultimately been the difference between this attempt and all my other failed ones!

Anyway, to all former smokers, keep battling away as in as little as 30 days you'll be pretty comfortable, healthier and richer!

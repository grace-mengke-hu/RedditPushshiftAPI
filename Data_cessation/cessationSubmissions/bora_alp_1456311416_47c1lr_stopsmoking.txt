Smoked one, need motivation

Hello everyone, I was smoke free for 4 days until today. I fucked up my second attempt by smoking a cigarette. I had a really important test today and all I could think of was smoking a cigarette. At one point my hands started shaking and I smoked a cig just to get it out of my head. I didn't want to fail in the test but a I messed everything up big time.

Now I feel amazingly guilty and stopped believing in myself. At this point I'm just making up excuses to start smoking again (weight gain, failing tests etc.)

Edit: thanks for all the advice. to the people who are mad at me because I couldn't find the time to reply: I had to drive from Ä°stanbul to Ankara to visit my grandmother who recently got sick. She had been diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was a heavy smoker until her husband died from a heart attack. Yet another reason to quit. I APPRECIATE ALL THE REPLIES, THANKS A TON!

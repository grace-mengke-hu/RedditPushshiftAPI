14 days as a non-smoker.

I never thought it would be this easy (ok easy is a lie, I've had influenza and bronchitis so the withdraw has been easy to ignore), I had my first real reminder last night that I don't smoke anymore when I had a dream I was nearly out of smokes.

Now if I can just kick this bronchitis and let my lungs heal I'll be golden.

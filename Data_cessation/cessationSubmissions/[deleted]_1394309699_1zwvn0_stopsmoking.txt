Day 3

So day 3 is upon me, and other then the odd craving here or there honestly its not to bad. I'm not anymore irritable then normal (Incompetent people piss me off everyday). As of day 3 I can now taste things better, for the first time in god knows how I long I wake up without any congestion in my nose. In the 8 hours I've been awake I have wanted to smoke 1 time and that passed after 2-3 minutes.

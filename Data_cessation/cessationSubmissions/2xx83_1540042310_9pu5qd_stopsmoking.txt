Almost 3 full days. Feeling ok.

In the past year, I've had

* one month long cold turkey quit

* two months on the vape (bullshit imo)

* innumerable &lt;1 day "attempts"

* innumerable cutdown attempts

* nearly 2 weeks smoke free on the patch.

So if I haven't quit this year you can't tell me it's for lack of trying, lmao. 

When I'm smoking, not a single day goes by that I don't think of quitting. I wake up in the morning and IMMEDIATELY smoke while hawking up loogies. I smoke so much at work that my lips will be chapped and sore by the end of the day. My sister in law won't let me hold my baby nephew unless I've just taken a shower. And the money! ~6% of my income!

Enough! If there's anything I've learned this year it's that NRT is just prolonging the addiction. I want to be through with this as soon as possible. 

It's been 2 days 19 hours. I've *not* been okay - I cussed out my partner and my coworker, almost broke a kitchen cabinet door, came home and was so angry i just pounded the wall with a rolled up newspaper while screaming - but each day is easier than the last I guess. Despite how they feel like they'll never end, it really doesn't take long for the cravings to become more dull and less persistent. The trick is maintaining the mindset going forward and not allowing any rationalizations. I'm just so sick of this shit and never want to have to go through this again. 

NOPE **N**ot **O**ne **P**uff **E**ver

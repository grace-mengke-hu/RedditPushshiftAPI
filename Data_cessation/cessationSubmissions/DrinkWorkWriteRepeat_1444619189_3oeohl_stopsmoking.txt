3 weeks in and I'm caving help!

Been 3 flawless weeks and a few days, but it is all I can think about! I am a rig hand and it is literally all around me. I am not chewing or using any nicotine and wish to continue this way because I will cave. I need tips or something to get this off my mind. I tried singing my "selfish habit will kill you" song everytime I got a craving which worked for the first two weeks, but it's lost it's magic charm...

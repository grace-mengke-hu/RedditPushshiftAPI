Wow, 8 months.

It's unreal. It seems like yesterday that I was struggling to even put down a cigarette for more than a couple hours at a time. Yet here I am today, 5,880 hours later, without one puff.

If you're just now hopping on the bandwagon, my advice is play your strengths and avoid triggers wherever possible. Know thyself. Know what sets you off and avoid it like hell until you can wade in a little deeper and know you'll be fine.

And lean on this group. Post here when you have a craving, remind yourself NOT of what you're giving up, but what you're consistently giving yourself each time you say NO. You're giving yourself new life, new ability, a new you, each and every time you say NO to a cigarette.

You can do it. If I can do it, anyone can. Promise.

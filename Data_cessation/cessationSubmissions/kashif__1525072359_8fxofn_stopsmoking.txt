Trying to quit smoking again

I'm trying to quit smoking again this is like the 7th time
I straight away start to get angry and annoyed and generally just in a bad mood always by 3rd or 4th day I end up buying some cigs 
This time I'm trying not to keep any money with me so that I can't buy cigs I'm also trying to not hang out with friends that smoke because it makes me want to smoke 
Hopefully this is the first smoke free day for the rest of my life

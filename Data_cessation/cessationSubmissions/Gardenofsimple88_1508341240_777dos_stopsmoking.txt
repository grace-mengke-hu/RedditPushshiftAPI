4 looong days...

Hi, I'm using the smoke free app and they recommended this site. Its been helpful to read and resonate with what you all have shared. I'm on day 4 of quitting (for the millionth time) but this time I'm cold -turkeying it. I feel like a crazy person...super emotional and having a hard time dealing with a huge life change that I'm going through. Its a lot to not have a solid place to live, be looking for a job, And be quitting smoking. At least I've got a supportive boyfriend...and this site! Keep up the good work everyone!

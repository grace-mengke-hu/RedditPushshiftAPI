Passed the 24 hour mark.

Got a patch, got a stop smoking app, subscribed to this sub, got the badge, and the cravings so far haven't been all that bad. I think it's because I'm seriously done and I know it. 

Thanks for the posts in here, reading them over the last few days has helped me prepare, and I'm more prepared now than I could ever be. If I fail, well, God help me. Lol

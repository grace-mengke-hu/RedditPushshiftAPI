One year

I'm 41. I smoked for 27 years....that's smoking more years than not smoking...gross. But I made it a year. I'm going to slap my forehead repeatedly today to give my brain a high five, and I will know that as painful and silly as it may look, it's better for me than smoking! As my friend Root Beer Guy says..."bingo bango."

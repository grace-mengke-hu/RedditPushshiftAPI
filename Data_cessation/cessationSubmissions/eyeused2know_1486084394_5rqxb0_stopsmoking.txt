How far does 1 cigarette set back the physical withdrawal?

Made it past 3 days & on to day 4. It was a horrible, horrible day for many reasons. I got to a point where I was ready to give up, not just the quit, but on life. In the middle of the madness, I grubbed one off a stranger and smoked it, about 10 hours ago. 

I do not have a pack, no intent to buy one or being around smokers right now. The issues of the day mostly got handled and I'm once again in control. 

So my question is: how bad did I screw up? Am I back to day 1 for w/d?

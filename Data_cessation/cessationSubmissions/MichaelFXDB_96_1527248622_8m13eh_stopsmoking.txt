Good evening from Japan!

Currently, I live in Okinawa japan, I’m out at one of my favorite bars, got the new cologne that I bought on... within 15 minutes I had a very sweet and beautiful girl that kept coming up to the bar next to me “talking to her friend that was a bartender”, turns out the reason she kept coming that way was because of my smell!... Got her number, and I have a date this week! Gents... this is our time to take control. Smelling better comes along with higher confidence... 5 days smoke free!

Man oh man the irritation

I know my lungs are just healing, but this is  immeasurably painful and long process.. I'm so fucking irritated all the time. Had bronchial spasms, was out of breath all day yesterday.

Staying with family right now and they don't know about my smoking habit, neither about my quit attempt and the irritation that comes with it. It's hard to control emotions all the time. 

Should never have smoked that first cigarette all those years ago

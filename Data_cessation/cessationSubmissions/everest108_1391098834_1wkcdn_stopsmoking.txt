Good for you guys! :)

Hi, I just learned of this sub and its awesome, the support you give is  stunning. I turned 19 yesterday, I've been smoking since 14(5 cig a day or less) and weirdly I really liked tobacco, its like wine, the taste is good and its  relaxing. When I was 15, my brother committed suicide and I started smoking actively 1 pack a day. Since then I rarely 'taste' tobacco, it has become sort of boring routine. But I still like it. Maybe I will quit after in my life, but right now I don't feel like it. Anyway I don't think tobacco is really that bad, its bad in large quantities just like anything else. But I feel that the smokers are ridiculed too much. So yeah, just wanted to say a few words. Keep up the good work. :)

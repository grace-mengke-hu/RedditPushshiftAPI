Day 23 Valentines Day Quitter

I’ve been feeling very motivated not smoking. I am a non smoker. I smell fantastic. I actually can put on perfume I’ve bought over the years and never actually smelled on my. My hair is getting very long and silky with less handfuls falling out all the time. My skin is smoother and not nearly as dry. I can breath and I just feel better about myself. 
But....
I read everyone’s posts about stress and then realize that’s why it’s been so easy for me. I’m in Maryland on TDY until April 14th. I have a rental car and a suite at the Hilton. Room service makes my bed and takes out my trash. My husband is in Colorado with the teenager and 6 year, the 7 month old Frenchie who refuses to house train and my E Bulldog. He cleans the house and the yard. Does all the laundry and dishes. Shuffles them to school and then to work. All while I just got to a very chill environment and am not around my normal Army routine of work. I have to wash only my own clothes once a weekend. 
What happens when real life hit and I go home. Back to stressful work and chaotic house??? Plus I start my masters program on the 20th.  Anyone experience a similar situation?

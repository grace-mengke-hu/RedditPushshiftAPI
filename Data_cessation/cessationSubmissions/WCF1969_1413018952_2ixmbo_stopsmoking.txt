I've hit double figures

So this is my 2nd time quitting within a month. First one in September lasted all of 5 days then I fell flat on my face. I quit again fairly soon after and this morning I've realised I'm on day 11 of my quit. I know it's not a month or year but double digits for me is HUGE!! 
My sleep is screwed up however my house has never been this clean or smelled this nice!!
Tonight will be the first night out since I quit - as I decided to stay away from temptation for the first week - wish me luck ðŸ˜„

Been 6 days!

Heavy smoker for the last 5 years here. Finally decided to quit. Boners are rock hard again and generally feeling a bit healthier. But there's this really strange bitter taste in my mouth thats not going away, any idea what it is and when it could go away? Also, every time I get a craving, I just remind myself I don't want to die of cancer like my dad did and waste away in front of me into a shell of a person.

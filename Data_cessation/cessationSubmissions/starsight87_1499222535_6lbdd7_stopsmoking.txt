Two months folks and feeling great

Saved up a good chunk of change, lungs don't even feel like they are the same ones and the anger sharks are gone at this point. I feel like I have a new lease on life with the added bonus of not worrying about a smoke every 30-40 minutes. 

Hang in there folks - it gets a lot better

Small victory

Just thought I would share what I consider to be my first real (although perhaps small) victory. For a little background, I do the majority of smoking  (and smoke ALOT when I do) on the weekend or less frequently in the evenings. I work with children during the week and somehow formed my habit around that. I finally decided it was going to happen for real, after a couple months of playing with the idea of quitting, yesterday was the day (I already had not smoked the two days previous, which is normal). I also happened to work a 14 hour day, and by the end of it I wanted a smoke SO bad. Luckily I had left my pack at home. I managed to get home and force myself straight into bed without smoking. I woke up this morning feeling proud of myself and not craving a cig! I honestly am having a hard time believing a fought past it and didn't allow myself to cave. Thanks to all of you for being such great motivation!

These quit smoking apps make quitting bigger deal than it actually is.

I used the popular ones and they were mostly full packed with features I didn't care. I was so sick that they make quitting such a huge deal. I have quit smoking multiple times and I have found it easy once I understood how nicotine addiction works. It's not the nicotine that is so addictive but  the advertising that goes behind it(being a masters in advertising). I have read about their ways of persuasion. So i created an app for myself that contains only those features that actually helped and did not irritate me after a while by making quitting such a big deal. Also, it motivates me when i  need it. Then I thought of releasing it on play store. So if someone would like to check out, here's the link:

Is Cutting Back Motivation/Guidance Allowed Here?

Hello,

I've been smoking a pack-a-day forever (4 years but close enough) and its time I cut back. I repeat, I do not want to quit - I like smoking entirely too much. But I definitely want to cut back. My goal is 2 cigarettes a day. 

Does anyone have any tips or tricks to help me do this? I've tried a few times where I limited the number of cigarettes I could smoke a day - starting at 20, and subtracting one a day - but I never could make it past 14-15. 

The last time I tried I even bought a vape pen to smoke instead whenever I wanted one. I think the problem is not only do I like smoking, but I like what I'm doing when I smoking and don't want to do those things without a cigarettes. For example, walking to the store, or sitting on my patio. While walking to the store isn't too bad with a vape pen, I can't sit on my patio with one. I think the problem is that a vape pen doesn't "End". And me finishing my cigarette is a cue for my patio sitting habits.

I honestly just want to smoke one with my morning coffee and one before I go to bed each day. (And maybe an occasional one on a work break. But not daily.) 

Please assist me in reaching my goal.

Thanks.

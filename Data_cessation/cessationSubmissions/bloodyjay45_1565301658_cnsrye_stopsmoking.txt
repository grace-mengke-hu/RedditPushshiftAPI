Made it two days but end up smoking

Made it two days (sorry I’m new ) but end up smoking I think it’s stress I really wanna quit I quit before for a whole year once it been plenty of times that I have without a cigarette for many days I don’t know for some reason it’s just feel different imma try again once I get all my other stuff together

Day 5: Disaster strikes, still haven't smoked.

FYI, I'm retiring this username for privacy reasons. I will continue posting as /u/salradicchio. 

I'm being a little melodramatic, but here's what went down. Since quitting, I've been pretty much allowing myself to eat whatever I want. So today I thought I'd go out for ramen. I'm vegan, and this ramen place has repeatedly told me their noodles are vegan, but when I went in today, they had listed allergens on the menu and it said the noodles have egg in them!! I asked to confirm, and they said the noodles have always had egg in them. Grrr. Well, I had a full stamp card, and they offered to sub rice for the noodles. That makes it definitely NOT ramen, but okay. I got it to go and brought it back to my office. I opened it up and I didn't see any nori! (My favorite part!) I thought, maybe it's under the bok choy. So I looked under the bok choy and found a tiny piece of meat!! And no nori. I'm sure the meat was an accident, but god damn. I just wanted a good lunch. I'm mad and a cigarette sounds good, but whatever. I don't need it. 

tl;dr: It's harder to get vegan ramen than it should be, but I didn't smoke about it.

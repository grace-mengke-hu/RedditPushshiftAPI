185 days smoke free to 3 packs in 3 days overnight.

185 days smoke free and *bam* as soon as I smoke some herb I was feigning for it. Immediately lit up when I had the chance, smoked three packs in three days, and I feel like my body has been hijacked by poison and slowness and lethargy. I feel pains in my chest when I make certain movements, I have this cloud in my head. I smell like shit.

I have one cigarette left and it's going to be my last. I quit cold turkey and made it 50 days once, then I did 103. I thought this would be the last time, I thought 180+ days was enough to never go back, but if my unfortunate and shitty badge reset means anything, *just know you're never really off the hook.* Doesn't matter *how* long it's been, all it takes is one puff.

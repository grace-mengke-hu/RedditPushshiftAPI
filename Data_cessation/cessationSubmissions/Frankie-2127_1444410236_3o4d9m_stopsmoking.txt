Day 13, not really craving but still really sad.

I smoked for 28 years and "quit" countless times but always went back. I know this time I'm quitting for good and I'm not really craving a cig but I sure do miss it. I miss that first smoke in the morning, or on break at work, or the transition smoke when I got home, or the one after dinner and before bed. I would use a cig as a reward when I completed a task, or as a "planning break " before starting a task. It all sounds silly, I know. But now when those times of the day come, instead of craving I just feel very sad. I cry daily for the routines lost, for the alone time missed and the thought that I am no longer who I was and have no idea who I am now. I haven't found the joy of quitting yet. Thoughts?

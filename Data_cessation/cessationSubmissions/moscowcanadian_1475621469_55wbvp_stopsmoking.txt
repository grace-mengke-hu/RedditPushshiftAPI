Back to day 1. For the last time.

I recently had to reset my badge after 65 days smoke free. I barely made it 24 hours after that. Alchohol has been a huge factor of it, I really can't resist the temptation when I've had a couple drinks, even when I'm on the patch I'll take it off and smoke. I also have been bad with smoking weed that has tobacco in it. I plan on taking a break from smoking weed to resist the temptation to put a little tobacco with it, but that usually ends up going out the window once I've had a few drinks. I'm in university and will therefore drink 2 or 3 nights a week and I don't have any plans on stopping that. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. But- like I said, this is the last time I quit!

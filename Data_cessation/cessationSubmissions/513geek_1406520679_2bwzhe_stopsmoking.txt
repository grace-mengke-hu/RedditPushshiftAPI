I quit smoking for three days and relapsed.

I'm not happy with myself. Last Tuesday I didn't smoke, I had my wisdom teeth removed that afternoon and the dentist said no smoking for 72 hours. I faithfully adhered, then Friday afternoon, thinking I don't have to worry about dry socket anymore, I picked up right where I left off Monday evening. I have got to quit. It's costing me $5 and some change every day, and who knows what regarding my long health.

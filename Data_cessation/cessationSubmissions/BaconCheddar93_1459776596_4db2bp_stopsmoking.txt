Day #1 wish me luck! (:

Hey guys, been a smoker for about 6 going on 7 years now...switched from smoking to vaping and then back to smoking again, then back to vaping and now up until last night I was doing a bit of both. About 5 smokes a day and 5ml of 3mg juice a day.

    I've got a bit of a sore throat and a head cold and just haven't had the motivation or desire to smoke or vape for the last couple days. I already went and got 4 packs of tea tree oil toothpicks. This is my first time quitting both smoking and vaping together. 

    I've been lurking this sub for a good couple of weeks and reading and just contemplating. I realize I'm at a place where I feel reliant on cigarettes and vaping and I want to be at a point of contentment and not feeling as though I need anything. 
    I'm currently 10 hours in and having my first craving as I write this. Thanks for being such a positive sub reddit there's always some new motivation or positive thing to read about on here and everyone is very uplifting. 
    I look forward to being a part of this community and finally kicking this smoking habit. On a side note, I've been finding mixed material on whether or not tea tree oil is okay to ingest. 
    I would assume they couldn't manufacturer a toothpick that you couldn't swallow the oil from but I'm not sure as I've heard ingesting tea tree oil could cause nausea and other problems.

     But okay enough of a rant I believe my craving has subsided for the time being, I look forward to reading your replies during my next one!

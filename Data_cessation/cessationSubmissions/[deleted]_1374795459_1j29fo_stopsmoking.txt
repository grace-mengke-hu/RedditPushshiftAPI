Just quit

Long time lurker here on Reddit and this sub inspired me to make an account. I just smoked my last cigarette about 10 minutes ago. 

I've quit for a weeks in the past but haven't been able to stick with it. Decided that I'm going to go through with it this time for my health and financial reasons. I'm hoping to get back in to running 5ks again this fall too. 

Wish me luck!

Benefits for sleeping

I've only quit for a week, but I don't feel that anyone emphasises the massive benefits that quitting has on sleep. I literally have had such issues waking up for years, and this week I've woken up happily at 7am feeling amazing. I know Smoke Free reminds you about energy, but honestly from day 1 of quitting I've slept better than I ever did for my 10 years of smoking. This is the best benefit I've felt so far, it makes my day so much better, despite the cravings and the irritability. Has anyone else felt this?

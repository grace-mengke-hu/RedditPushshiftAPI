First real test

Sitting at 3 days and 12 hours nicotine free. It's been fairly straight forward so far but today is a struggle. Just got a test back that I thought I had done well on and ...I did not. I'm fairly certain my instructor fucked up the marking but I am just CRAVING a smoke so bad. Looking for some advice how to deal with this without smoking!

Can’t believe it’s been 320 days since my last cigarette.

This is unbelievable. I held a promise to myself for the first time in forever. 46 more days until it’s one year. I can’t believe it. It feels just like yesterday I posted about being 48 hours cigarette free. And here we are 10 months and 16 days down.

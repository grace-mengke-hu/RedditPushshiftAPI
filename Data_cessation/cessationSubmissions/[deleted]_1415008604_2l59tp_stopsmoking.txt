Feeling the damage

Reset my badge again. I went for a run the other day after about a month of no exercise and heavy smoking. I'm skinny but not athletic, used to be able to run 3kms continuously, but the other day my chest started hurting not even halfway through my usual route. Shit's scary.

Been smoking on and off for 6 years, longest I've quit was 6 months, about 2 years ago. Time for a change. The last time I quit and became active on this sub, it helped me go through one month. Hopefully this time around I'll do better.

73 days before I caved

Quit smoking on October 11. Longest quit so far. Smoked a pack already since last night. Feeling quite ughhhh. Hopefully I’ll be back to my no smoking thing tomorrow. Just feeling stressed and missing home during the holidays. My best friend is working a 12 hour shift tomorrow, and I’m trying my best to distract myself. Any suggestions to get through tomorrow?

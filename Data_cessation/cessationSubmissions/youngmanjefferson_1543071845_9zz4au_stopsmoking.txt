1 month clean

I started vaping nicotine at the age of 15 because I thought it was cool. Suffered from being extremely addicted and had a very strong dependence on it. Spent hundreds of dollars on vaping devices, juices and pods. Tried quitting several times, relapsed several times.
    I am 17 years old and now I can now proudly say that it has been one whole month since I have consumed nicotine in anyway shape or form.

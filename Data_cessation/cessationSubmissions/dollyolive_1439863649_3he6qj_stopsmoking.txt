I had 2 drags of a cigarette after 134 days no smoking. Im so sad about this

Ok so my cravings have been coming back in the last 3 weeks but they have been very manageable. I have lost my job and am moving to the other side of the world to begin a new life so my stress may have contributed to my cravings. I got really drunk two nights ago and my friend gave me a cigarette. I had two drags of the cigarette and then instantly regretted it and put it out. I had been 134 days straight no smoking! I am so annoyed/angry/frustrated at myself and feel like I have to start all over again or that me having those two drags will make my cravings worse! Im also not sure if I should rest my badge. Im so so sad about this :( What should I do?

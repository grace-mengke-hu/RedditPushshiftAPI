I need help learning how to curb my irritability

Hello quitters, I'm new to this subreddit and 2 weeks into quitting.  It was easy in the beginning but now it's been increasingly harder. I read in Gladwell's The Tipping Point that my dopamine levels are readjusting and I can honestly say that I have been more stressed, more irritable, and deal with the occasional headaches. 

I've always been associated with being extremely laid back and agreeable. I find myself being angry at my closest friends for petty shit I normally don't even pay attention to. 

Any advice or help, I'd be more than grateful to hear from you. Thanks!

Day 22 - Worried about what happens after Step 3 with the Patch.

So I never thought I would see my lil badge make it to 22 days. 

I have to say it's been going a lot better then anticipated. Of course the hardest part (first 3 days) was a bit difficult. I am using a patch, currently on step 2 (14mg) and slated for next week to drop down to step 3 (7mg).

What I am curious about is what happens after step 3, going off the patch. What is to expect with cravings? Is it like when I stepped down  to 14mg?

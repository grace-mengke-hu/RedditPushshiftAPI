Any tips on Dreaming of smoking?

I am using ecigs(MVP with a MOW tank) and have had better sucess than ever before. I am tapering down the nicotine (from 24mg to 18mg) and am really really happy with myself. I have stolen two puffs off a real cig and they taste disgusting.

Problem is, I still dream I have a cigarette and I wake up feeling like an A-hole for cheating. Anyone else have this issue? Any protips? Please tell me they fade away too.

Thanks All!

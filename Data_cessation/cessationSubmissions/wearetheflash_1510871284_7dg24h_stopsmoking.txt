I quit for about a month but now i started again and i cant stop

I just got out of highschool and i moved with my parents halfway across the country so i found myself depressed and alone and i picked up smoking. 

Then about a month later i decided to join the army and had quit cold turkey pretty easily. However when i was rejected from the army i found myself even more depressed and angry than before and i fell down that slippery slope again but  even harder this time and am finding myself having a harder time quitting. 

The army was really good for me because i got motivated and ready to quit but now i dont really have that. I can try again for the army in january but thats a long ways away and i am having difficulty getting as motivated as i was before. 

Im not really sure what i hope to get out of this post, i guess i just needed to get it off my chest as my parents arent really the supportive type.

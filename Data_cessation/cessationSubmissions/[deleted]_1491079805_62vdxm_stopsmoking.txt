did not smoke... but I did get my old vape out

and had a few hits. I needed some sort of kick start or something. I found myself just sitting and staring. For hours. And thinking about smoking. Wasted a huge chunk of the day. I'm wondering of I threw everything off by not remembering my patch yesterday and then putting it on late in the day only to take it off a few hours later. Today has been a disappointment. I feel as if I've made NO progress and have little to show for my 35 days. I do smell better, though.

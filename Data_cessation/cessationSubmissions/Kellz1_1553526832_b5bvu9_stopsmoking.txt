I'm smoking since I was 13 years old, I'm 32 now and it's time to finally quit!

I'm posting here so I can be held reliable.

This is my first attempt really, I don't know why I just keep smoking all these years, man fuck this it can't be so hard to just quit. Everyone is telling me it is all about willpower. My mother smoked for 25 years and quitted decades ago. My dad and lot's of friends quitted aswell. I want to quit aswell! I smoke around 15 cigs a day, mostly when playing competitive video games in the evening and at work. I won't stop gaming but I'll stop smoking, I can fucking do this I'm so over it, I stink, my lungs hurts, I'm  coughing, my body feels bad, my girlfriends doesn't like the taste and smell either, I spent around 150â‚¬ per month on this shit. Why not just fucking STOP? I'm getting angry at myself right now literally tearing up, FUCK THIS I'M DONE!

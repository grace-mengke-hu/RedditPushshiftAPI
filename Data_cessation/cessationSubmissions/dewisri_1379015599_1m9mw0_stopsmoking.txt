Please consider donating your cigarette money to a charity

When I quit smoking in 2004 (after smoking for about 20 years), there were several things that helped.

1\. **Drinking tea when I had a craving.** The caffeine gave me a small jolt and the steam felt good in my lungs.

2\. **Setting a quit date well in advance.** I gave myself several months (perhaps too much time) to smoke "guilt-free," knowing that I would quit on New Year's Day. Instead of getting down on myself for smoking I would ask myself, "Are you really enjoying this?" and each time I would reply, "Nope. It's dirty, unhealthy, and expensive, and I'm just doing it because I'm addicted." I was very happy to quit when the new year arrived.

3\. **Quitting the craving and not the cigarettes.** I had failed at quitting cigarettes several times because I could not imagine never smoking another one, but it was much easier to quit the craving. Each time I had a craving I would acknowledge how crappy it felt and tell myself that the cravings would only grow weaker if I would resist each one. They did grow weaker and now I go years without a craving, and when I do experience one it is easily ignored.

4\. **Tracking the benefits of my recovery.** I don't endorse this site. It's just the first I found that gives a lot of detail about such benefits.

5\. **Donating my cigarette money to charity.** I've been donating the money I would have spent on cigarettes to Doctors Without Borders every since I quit. Check out your preferred charity to see what a monthly donation can do. This is what mine does.

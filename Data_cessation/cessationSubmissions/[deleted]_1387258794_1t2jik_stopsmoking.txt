Im going for it!

Ok, i have been creeping this sub reddit for awhile and it is my time. Im rolling up my last ciggarette after I type this and then it's over, I have quit before; the longest being four months about a year ago. I'm actually in the middle of my exam week so I have alot on my plate stress wise but hey, smoking just adds to stress anyways right?!? Yea im going to enjoy this butt smoke and then move on with my life and never touch these things again.

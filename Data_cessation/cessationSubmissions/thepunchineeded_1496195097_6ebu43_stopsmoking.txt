So I failed, but....

Today was day 3 with no cigarettes, and I made the mistake of having friends over (smokers who think it's crazy I'm trying to quit), and I ended up smoking 2 cigarettes. I'm pissed at myself of course, but I made a revelation. Oh my god do I stink! It's all I can smell right now and I'm about to go take a shower and brush my teeth. I cant stand it, I really smelled like this for the past 10 years?! Also, I thought 3 days wouldn't make a difference in how I've always viewed the beautiful demon that is cigarettes, but they were horrible. They tasted so nasty and even now the lingering taste in my mouth is making me nauseous. I never realized how much it changes the flavor of everything, even water! So yes, I fucked up, but I'm resetting my badge and I'm doing this for good. I refuse to be a walking ashtray for the rest of my life!

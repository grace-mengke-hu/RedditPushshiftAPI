I decided to quit today.

I tossed my last cigarette out the window this morning and decided it's time to stop putting it off and just do it.

Wish me luck guys, and also I know everybody is completely different, but if you have any tips that can help me get through the first stages, throw them my way. I've been chewing gum (just normal Extra) all day at work, and actually went and bought myself a Nicorette Inhaler, which seems okay so far.

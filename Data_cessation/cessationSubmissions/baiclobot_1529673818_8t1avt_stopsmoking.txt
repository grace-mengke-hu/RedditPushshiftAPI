Day two again. :/

So I quit Monday but I had a slip on Wednesday so I suppose this is day 2.  

Today I noticed my coffee tastes better than usual. Unfortunately I also noticed my son was stinkier than usual when he woke up this morning. (Heâ€™s a hot sleeper) 

So I guess my taste and smell is coming back. Juryâ€™s still out on whether itâ€™s a good thing. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜¬

On a serious note, staying accountable to this group and making myself read everyoneâ€™s quit stories to get me through these last days has been so insanely helpful. In two weeks or two months or two years when Iâ€™m out of the thick of my quit it will be thanks to all of you.

Quitting is contagious!

So this all started with my parents.  My dad who is 68 and was a smoker since he was an 11 year old boy (the times were different then) quit when he got prostate cancer (caused by agent orange not smoking- military.  He's doing very well).  My Mom quit with him. Time passed and I quit during my pregnancy- I have always quit when pregnant, it's that whole thing of I can do it for someone else but not for myself thing.  So as soon as I was done nursing I started smoking again.

But at my daughter's first bday my best friend since being a kid had quit!!  And she was the final inspiration I needed.  A month later my husband and I are quit.  I am 13 days today, two weeks tomorrow!!  I did have a half a cig during the Breaking Bad finale... augh yeah BUT it was gross and really just solidified this all for me so I am still considering myself quit and didn't change my badge.  Beating addiction is a process.  But I really feel it this time.  The cravings are already fewer and mostly strike in the evenings when I feel entitled to "unwinding".  But I am finding new positive thing to fill my time with that are actually nurturing- like doing my nails or things like that.

Anyway, I've been lurking and up-voting since I quit.  Felt like it was time to share something.

Oh and I am doing this cold turkey, not using patch or e cig or gum.  Just will power and encouragement.

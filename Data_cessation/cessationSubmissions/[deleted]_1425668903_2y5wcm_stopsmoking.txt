I am drunk. I'm having such a hard time right now. I feel that I can't be happy without a cigarette. Please help me!

This is my 12th day without smoking. I've never gotten this far.
Now, I feel like I just can't enjoy life without a cigarette. It's like I'm super thirsty but there's no water around. I could really use some tips to get me trough this.

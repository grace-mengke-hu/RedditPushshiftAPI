Right out of the blue

I was at work, a bit stressed, but nothing unusual. 

It was suddenly time to go out for a smoke. Like, Right. Fucking. Now.

I didn't even think about it, I just started to get up and head out the door. 

I didn't, of course. Stupid Brain! Fuck off!

Be careful of your untriggered triggers. Or something.

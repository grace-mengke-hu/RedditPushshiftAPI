Nervous. Quitting tomorrow.

I've smoked for about 12 years, and in that time I've "quit" about five times.  Twice for over a year. This time I'm for real.  Never going back. I'm not that young anymore (early 30s), it's fucking expensive, it's hurting/killing me, and it's such a stigma. I'm afraid my boss (relatively new job) thinks less of me because I smoke,  and I love my job and cigarettes are in no way worth risking my health/job/finances. 

But y'all know all this,  pretty standard stuff. 

I'm currently on Chantix, 6 days in.  Tomorrow is my first no-cig day and I'm already nervous as fuck and even a little sad about it (sad? WTF is wrong with me?). 

Anyway, I just wanted to pop in and introduce myself.  I have a feeling this sub will help me. Every time I want a cig I'm going to come here and read to try to keep myself strong. 

Any other tips? Even though I've quit before it was incredibly hard and my most recent couple of quits have been short lived because of the anxiety and maybe the lack of support. 

In the past, I've tried to just "not think about it" or pretend it's easy and I got this. But now I'm realizing that maybe that didn't work because I wasn't being honest with myself that it's a true struggle. 

So I'm thankful for this sub already.  I hope I don't annoy y'all if I start posting or commenting a lot.  I really need an outlet so to speak.

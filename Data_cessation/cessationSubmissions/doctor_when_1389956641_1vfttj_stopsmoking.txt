Quitting: Day 1

This is like my 3rd or 4th time trying to quit, but this time i actually want to make it work, i just found this sub today and hoping that it'll help, i've been smoking for a little under 2 years now and I hate it yet love it. i need to quit because im pretty much starting my new life in 4 months and dont want smoking to have any part in it. Also my girlfriend hates it and has been trying to get me to quit for i dont know how long, and i just want to be the man she knows i can be...

well here goes nothing, thanks for the support /r/stopsmoking

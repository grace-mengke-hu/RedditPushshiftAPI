Starting my plan to Stop Smoking

So... It's hard to stop smoking faster for me. First because I have anxiety problems, second because my boyfriend (yep, gaaaaay here :P) smokes and I don't want to force him to stop. So yes, it's hard for me.

Any tips? I do want to stop smoking, but I keep delaying my "stop smoking day". :(

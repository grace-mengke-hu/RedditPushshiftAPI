Tomorrow...

Tomorrow will be a whole week. YEAY. I have quit 20 or thirty times before, but haven't in over a year. This time is the easiest so far. I am using my smoke free app and making sure to stay really really busy with my hands. If i get bored i find  chore until i feel ok just relaxing. Started drinking my coffee again and even had a few beers last night. I feel less irritated with people at work, and am sleeping very deeply. Exhausted by nightfall to be honest. Anyway, enjoying this journey. Keep up the good work all of you!!

24 hrs in... mostly okay

Using Chantix, feeling like it's only slightly better than previous cold turkey quits. Overall my mood is pretty blah, and while I have little patience today, I also don't feel up for throwing any fits. The idea of smoking just doesn't appeal to me today, and I've got the wisdoms of Mr. Alan Carr surfacing here and there.  I muscled through this morning, and hoping tomorrow morning is a little bit easier. 

Wishing you all the best wherever you are in your journey.

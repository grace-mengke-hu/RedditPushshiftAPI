What do you do to get your mind off cravings?

I'm looking to finally quit for good (mostly inspired by me having to have a wisdom tooth pulled soon, fuck dry socket). I swapped smoking for vaping a while back (turns out it just turned into an entirely new addiciton, go figure) and I'll still have analogs on the weekend when I'm drinking with friends.

Left my vape at home today, and I'll be tossing it in the dumpster as soon as I'm off work. 

So I guess I'd like to hear some ideas on how some of you guys dealt with cravings.


Edit: this is mostly for when I'm at work. In my free time I can occupy.myself fine, it's more when I get stressed at work and want some nicotine I'm looking for a bit of health with.

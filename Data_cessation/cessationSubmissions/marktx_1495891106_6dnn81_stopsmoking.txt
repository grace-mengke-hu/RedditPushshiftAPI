It's time to go

Well, it's been 4 years now, I feel like I've graduated. I stopped on the night before my daughter's third birthday knowing that if I didn't stop this I would take away so much time from her father when she gets older.. It felt so wrong, I felt so selfish, that's when I had a crisis of conscience.. She's turning seven years old tomorrow, but she's the one who gave me the greatest gift of all.. I haven't had even one drag since that night four years ago..

Cravings are almost non-existent, when they do come up they're easily defeated, I've completely rejected smoking after being a pack a day smoker for over 15 years. I can breathe so much better, I can run 5 miles/8k's without stopping (and getting better), I've saved enough for money for a 20% house deposit. Everything about life is better without cigarettes.. I still do smoke marijuana once in a while though :)

I don't post much here anymore, and the majority of the time I have thoughts about smoking is when a post pops up on reddit from this sub.

So, today is the today I unsubscribe.

Thank you for all the support, and good luck to those of your starting your journeys, your life will be so much better once you've done this.

Allan Carr's Easyway audiobook really helped, I would suggest it to anyone. When you *want* to do something, it's easy, you just have to honestly *want* it. I was surprised by how easy it was at first, it did get tougher at points early on, but I *wanted* to stop, and I did.

Not one puff, not one drag, not one cigarette. I'm a nicotine junkie, that shit fucks me up, I can't handle it, not even a little bit. Not one puff, not one drag, not one cigarette.

Thank you, goodbye, it's time to go.

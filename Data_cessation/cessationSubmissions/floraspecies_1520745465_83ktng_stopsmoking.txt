Nothing Works

I've been trying for years. I've avoided buying cigarettes for the past 4 months or so because I know that literally anyone will let me bum one, and I just don't feel guilty about stealing cigarettes.

The worst part is that I'm consciously aware that I don't enjoy it. Every time I put it in my mouth I start to feel shitty immediately. By the time I'm done smoking it I want to cry. The more stressed I am, the more I want one, and the worse it gets.

Can I blame the nicotine, or is this suicide?

I don't expect an answer to that. I'm just venting...

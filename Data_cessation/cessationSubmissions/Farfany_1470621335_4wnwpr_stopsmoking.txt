Relapsed at a party.

Last week I relapsed whilst drinking at a party. I don't know how it happened.

Okay, I do. I wasn't even that drunk, I still remember. Parties are situations in which I let loose on my inhibitions and have traditionally allowed that to continue to cigarettes. I was already pretty hammered when I arrived, having slammed down about 5 or 6 shots before heading out the door. I thought to myself, "hey, some cigarettes would be nice." So without thinking, or rather without deciding to think, I headed into the gas station and woosh. There I was. 

By the end of the night I had bought another pack, sharing cigarettes, giving them away, getting them. My chest felt constricted in the morning. I must have smoked at least a pack to myself in a ~12 hour period.

I'm not sure why I'm making this. Drinking and smoking are both big problems for me, and though I realize this I always find myself crawling back to the two. It just feels good to write it out, I suppose.

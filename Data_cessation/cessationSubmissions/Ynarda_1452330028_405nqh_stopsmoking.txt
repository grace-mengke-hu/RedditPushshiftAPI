These badges on this subreddit scares me

I look at old posts. 4 months ago, 6 months ago, a year, and everyone has a badge. They have badges with 300 days, 400 days, and it scares me that in the meantime they relapsed and gave up the fight.

What if they began smoking again but didn't come here to remove their badge because they didn't care anymore. Or because they were ashamed.

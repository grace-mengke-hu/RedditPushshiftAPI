30 DAYS!

Wow, I can't believe it!  I never thought I would get here.  15 years of stink and wasted money.  The only advice I can give is the read Allen Carr's Easy Way to stop Smoking.  I honestly quit smoking before i got through the book and I haven't looked back.  Some days are harder than others, but my quality of life has improved 10x from a month ago.  Thanks r/stopsmoking, couldnt have made it this far without you.

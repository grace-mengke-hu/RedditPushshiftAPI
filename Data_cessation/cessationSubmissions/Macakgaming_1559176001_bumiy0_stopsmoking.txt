It has to stop now!

I was a smoker for ten years and it wass cool at start i was like the cool guys in the group but then i lost relatives and i realised i just can't take it anymore now i even have no money for them and today is the day when i am officialy over i did a lot of research and finnaly got courage to QUIT but still feel like a iam not supported but i know i am deep inside :)

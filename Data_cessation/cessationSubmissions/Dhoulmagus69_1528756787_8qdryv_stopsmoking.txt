I missed my 2 year anniversary

Yep. 2 years was May 30th and I forgot. Man, it went so fast and now I'm another 2 years older. 

I smoked for close to 20 years, topped out at 30 Marlboro 100s a day. I no longer think or care about cigarettes, I ride in cars and sit around people who still smoke and absolutely have no desire to smoke anymore. I just don't care. I'm a nonsmoker now.  


Hopefully this little post gives some of you fresher blood a bit of a boost. It may take a while but life will eventually just be life again, without the cigarettes (or the $12\~ a day I used to spend on my habit).

Doubtful

I've been having major doubts about my ability to keep up the whole quitting game. Haven't broken yet but it feels like an inevitability (which I know is the exact wrong thing to be thinking). I read somewhere that people are rarely successful on their first quit attempt and the idea stuck with me. It's like I expect myself to fail at any moment. Help?

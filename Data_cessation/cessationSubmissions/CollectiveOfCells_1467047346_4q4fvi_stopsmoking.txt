Just completed 3 years nicotine free after smoking for almost 40 years.

I just wanted to offer up some encouragement to everyone quitting or wanting to quit. I'm 57 and started smoking when I was 16. I quit June 24th 2013, and I want to tell you how great it is to be free of the addiction.

I had a little help in quitting. My doctor prescribed Bupropion (Wellbutrin) for depression. I didn't realize it at the time, but this gradually takes away your bodies ability to enjoy nicotine. Initially I started smoking more, until I reached the point of almost three packs in a day (I've been mostly a pack a day most of my life). 

One Sunday night I lay in bed with my lungs actually hurting, and I decided I would try to make it through the morning without a cigarette. When I accomplished that, I decided maybe I could make it to lunch. When I did that, I decided to go the entire day. One day led to a week. I modified my habits to avoid triggers; greasy food, beer, etc. I also started taking brisk walks whenever the urge was strong. 

My wife smokes and I broke down once or twice, but I only puffed and didn't inhale. After a year it was smooth sailing, I never break down anymore. I no longer take bupropion. 

I feel absolutely fantastic. I'm exercising and have lost the additional pounds I put on. I feel like a relapse is impossible at this point. 

TL;DR If I can quit after almost 40 years, you can too. Take it one day or one hour at a time.

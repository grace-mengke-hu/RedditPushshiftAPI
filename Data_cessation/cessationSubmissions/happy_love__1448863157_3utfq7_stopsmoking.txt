Stoping smoking strange symptoms

Hey guys, I've been doing my best to stay clear of nicotine, just lately I have been having such horrible symptoms that I feel plagued everyday when I'm alone. The fear gets to me, I had a small bit of natural tobacco today cause it was getting too much but that didn't even help. I would have to go back to being an addict again to get this to stop completely, first it was the breathing problems, it constantly feels like I don't have enough air in my lungs, I know I have enough because I can hold my breath for me over a minute and feel fine after.

It's just with me all the time, like I'm missing something from my chest, it's so hard to describe. I also have been getting twitches and horrible wrist and finger cramps, along with pain in my legs. I go to the Drs all the time here in Canada but they really don't do much. I'm at my wits end over this whole thing. The last thing I wanna do I smoke again but my breath and body and mind are being taxed so heavily. I'm doing my best not to allow myself to become convinced by this fear but at the moment it drives me bonkers. I would really enjoy some support and maybe even someone saying they have gone thru the same thing. I wanna be completely nicotine free. I can feel I'm on the edge, so,e part of me is trying to convince myself that I'm going to die soon so I might as well stop my non smoking. 

Go to when it was normal before. I just really need some guidance here guys. Much respect to you all. I'm scared everyone, I don't wanna be tho.

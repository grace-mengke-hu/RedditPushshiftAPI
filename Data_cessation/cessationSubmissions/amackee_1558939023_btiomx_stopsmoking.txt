6 months after quitting, still wreaking havoc on my life....

Hi guys, so I’m hoping someone here can offer me some help, and will probably repost if I don’t get a response, hope that is okay. 

In December, I got a tooth absess and for the 1st time in my life, I was in too much pain to smoke. I absolutely knew that this was my window. And I quit. I had been smoking for about 13 years and over the last year, more and more I had been realizing it wasn’t bringing me as much joy as it was pain, so I took my shot and I ran with it. 

The huge problem is, after smoking so long, my body is still looking for that dopamine hit. Once I realized that I needed to chill a bit on my drinking, food took its place, still drinking a bit, but the real deal is eating like a psycho.

I’m fully aware that when I’m doing it, it’s totally to try and get a dopamine hit. It’s like my body does not know how to deal with stress, without constant dopamine spikes. 

I know it’s unhealthy, I know it’s wrong, but there’s times when I feel I’m developing a binge eating disorder. There’s times lately I get so miserable with my body, I just want to go back to smoking. I feel like I’m wearing a fat suit, and I know that nicotine would help me take this all away. 

But I also know I’m not the first to deal with this, someone has to understand!!!! 

If I see a psychologist, as I’m thinking of doing, can they help me get level? I have a history with depression and adhd, and now I’m thinking maybe this is the result of stopping self medication?

Please help me.

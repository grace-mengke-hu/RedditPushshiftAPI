This is day one.

Hey current and future cigarette cravings. This is day one. My last cigarette was at 3 P.M., it is now 12 A.M. and yes I am already struggling. EVEN THOUGH, I  currently feel like I have concrete in my chest from the respiratory infection I get every winter, because I am a smoker.

How is it that I still want to smoke? Even though my lungs ache and burn, as they fall apart once again.. like you knew they would. What did you say to yourself in October? "I need to quit now, or in January I will pay the price." 

Well, I didn't quit and the cold has come to collect. 

And yet still... I just want to smoke! Why do I want to make it even worse? The fever and chills racking my body are unbearable, yet all I can think about is smoking? 

Fuck. That.

I have ruined my lungs and throat, but if I can stop now, I may save my life. I want to be able to sing again, I want it too not feel like my heart is quitting on me and to have this feeling of perpetual dizzyness to go away. I want to be able to walk, run, and be active again! I want to be able to taste and smell properly again. I want this slow creeping feeling of what I can only imagine is my last unassisted breathe to go away. I want the feeling of death to go away...

So! 

I am proving too myself that I am capable of doing this. Even though as I type this I begin rationalizing keeping the smokes I have now, "just incase" I say? Just incase what? That I continue this filthy habit when I can start barely breathing again? 

No.

I will win.

Fuck you cigarettes, fuck you friends who smoked and introduced me to them. But, fuck myself the most. For being so weak willed and stupid as to smoke them in the first place.

I have now smashed my remaining packs and come to the battlefield with all of you. To face down the greatest foe of my life. Good luck to you all and stay strong. Whether you're an hourÂ in, a day in, or ten years. You are stronger than a cigarette and we will win.

This. Is. Day. One.

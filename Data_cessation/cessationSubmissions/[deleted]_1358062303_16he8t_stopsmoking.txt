One Year - My thoughts and ramblings

For me, the first ninety days were pretty rough. I basically held on by telling my self that it would get better over time... and it did. 

The memory of how I felt for those first ninety days is my first response to my internal dialogue when I think how nice it would be for a relaxing cigarette. 

Another tool in my mind is the memory of last time I fell of the wagon. That first cigarette tasted like crap... there was no rush of relief. I actually had to get myself re-addicted. Smoking one cigarette never really made me feel better, but eventually after smoking these dumb things that didn't make me feel better, I started to feel like crap when I didn't smoke them. 

My biggest regret in my journey has been my weight gain. I put on about 30-40 pounds after I quit. I used food as a substitute for smoking. I kept telling myself that gorging myself was better for my health than smoking. I'm sure there's a certain point where things start to tip the other direction, but I'm not sure where that point is.

The good news is, I've started to battle my weight in much the same manner as I battled my nicotine addition. It's pretty amazing how similar the thought patterns are in my mind. The same internal dialogue seems to play out.

If I could go back in time, I really wish I'd started exercising right when I quit. I feel so good right now after working out. So much better than when smoking and so much better than eating until I wanted I was actually physically uncomfortable.

I wish everyone on their journey the best of luck!

tldr; It does get better over time... be careful with eating and don't become a fattie like I did.

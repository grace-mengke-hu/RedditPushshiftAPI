...I’m glad I didn’t buy or have any cigarettes today.

Previous days the want for a smoke hasn’t really been present or super like in my face/blood stream/etc., my complaints (from my intention and perspective) have been related to a triggering event or lack of sleep - discomforts; thoughts of smoking without a real desire to...anyway. Today, today I desperately wanted to buy, smoke and enjoy a pack of camel wide menthols...wanted it so badly it felt almost like I needed it which I haven’t experienced this quit and hoped I would not experience. Yet. Here it came today. 

Today though. Almost allllll day. I was not just on edge, I was the edge, ready to fling myself free and take whoever is standing on the edge with me. (Long way to say, if I didn’t have very little money in my bank I probably would have bought cigarettes or at least go to the counter and really consider it!). 

Snarky 11-year old, unmotivated 14-year old and PMSING almost 40-year old (that’s me) = terrible combination for a MLK day at home. Had to leave for a while. Chose to work even though today is a recognized paid day off for my agency.

I have scowled a lot today. And laid in bed. Begged for silence. Rode in a quiet car then turned on some relax music then some rock music then some music by women only. Came home to mini-cakes made by the 11 year old and the 14-year old has cleaned up the kitchen. That was nice. We finished watching/caught up on Superstore on Hulu. Awww. Much better early evening ❤️

Ended the evening with an argument (read: he’s screaming, I’m holding the phone away from my face and trying to speak calmly) about the 14-year old wanting to stay home this weekend...Er, oops sorry stay at THIS, mommy’s home this weekend vs going to THAT, daddy’s home this weekend. Because...”**huffhuffhuff** they have more than one home, you know!” So the the want reared up again...my blood pressure just crazy, heart going...so I took some valerian caps instead. Made some sleepy tea with breathe deep tea and I’m enjoying this until sleep comes (please for all that is holy, come visit me tonight sleep!!)

I use this app a lot and thanks for those tolerating me. I don’t have people so this is where I’m getting support. Thank you all who are bearing with me. I’m hopeful my support is useful for you all as well 😁🎉

Day 17 smoke free and feeling dizzy

It has been 17 days since I quit cold turkey and I have started feeling quite dizzy. It did not just all a sudden happen, when I first made a major cutback days before quitting I started feeling it, it went away for a little and started again around day 10. It is also made slightly worse after having my morning coffee,  Is this normal? or has anyone else experienced this? I was smoking a pack every 2 days for 12 years.

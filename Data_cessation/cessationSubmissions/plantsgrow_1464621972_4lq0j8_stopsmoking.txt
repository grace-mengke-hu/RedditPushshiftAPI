LPT- change your computer password to help you quit

Hey guys. I'm over 6 months cigarette free now!! I can't even believe it most days.   
I wanted to share a tip that I think has helped in my success to becoming a nonsmoker. 
Change your computer password to a positive non-smoking affirmation.  
About 8 months ago I changed my password to "iamnotasmoker" (pls don't come steal my computer..! I have changed my pw it since)  
I think it helped positively reinforce the idea that I am not a smoker every time I logged on.  
Good luck!

Day 3: I'm not sure if I'll be able to handle it

I started working at a gas station on nights about 4 weeks ago. I had quit smoking 4.5 months previous to that and was doing great, next to no craving. After a few nights, I started developing cigarette cravings. Which got progressively worse and I eventually gave into the 'just one smoke' monster about 2 weeks into starting this job. That night before my shift I bought a pack. I was a smoker again.

For about a week and a half I smoked about a quarter of what I used to. Something like 8 cigarettes a day. Most of them were had during my shift. Now, I think I've figured out the cause of my cravings which is just seeing the joy other smokers getting their drug. I get oddly jealous when I sell someone a pack. Being so close to the cigarettes and easily being able to just grab a pack has got me really wanting them.

My last smoke was about 65 hours ago. And the first two days went great, next to no real cravings where I needed a cigarette. I started my quit at the start of my 'weekend', but just 2 hours into my shift, I'm craving so hard its almost unbearable. I've been fighting it off for the last hour or so.

My major issue is that I know I'll be able to quit when I'm not here. This job is just a filler job after a back injury had my off work for 6 months. I've accepted another position where I'm not going to be near cigarettes. I know I'll succeed in an environment where I'm not tempted. But I'm really trying to justify feeling this craving hell for the next 2 weeks. I really just want to give in and ease my craving so I can focus.

Tl;dr Started smoking again after 4.5 months. Quitting the job that is causing my craving in 2 weeks. Not sure if I want to subject myself to more 2 weeks of hell because cravings just don't happen when I'm not at work.

Also this is my first reddit post ever and I'm on mobile. Sorry for formatting.

Day 5 of quitting smoking - advice needed from ex-smokers

Monday July 22 I started using the patch to aid in my stop smoking plan which I have dubbed with my boyfriend and best friend (Who are both quitting as well) Operation Team Cessation.

So far the quitting part hasn't been the issue I am actually doing really well and being on day 5 my habits are slowly changing. I need advice about how I am handling my hand-to-mouth fixation.

I replaced smoking with eating celery sticks, cucumber slices, and green/yellow bell peppers. I did a lot of reading about the calories and benefits (as well negatives, which wasn't many) regarding consuming these greens. 

I know it's hard and if not impossible to avoid gaining weight but being a bigger girl I am wondering if I can at least stabilize at my same size so down the road when I am over the slump I can shed some pounds. 

I should note I am also going for walks at night now, which honestly I had been too lazy to do. So I am getting at least a little bit of exercise in. 

What is your experience with weight gain/loss during your quitting stages. Are the snacks I am replacing cigarettes with the right ones? Or should I not be snacking at all (take note I know that snacking during the day is better for you with appropriate portioned lunch/dinners. I do have a healthy breakfast as well).

Any tips would be appreciated! I just can't afford to gain more weight being at a higher number already but I need this healthy change in my life since my father had a heart attack 4 weeks ago (He was a heavy smoker and since then both my mom and dad have quit) I don't want to see myself in the same position later in life.

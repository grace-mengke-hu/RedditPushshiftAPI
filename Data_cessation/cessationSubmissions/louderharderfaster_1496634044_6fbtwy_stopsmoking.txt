Day Two

I've been tapering off another substance for 30+ days and quit coffee CT on the day I started tapering so day before yesterday I decided to see if I could stop smoking cigarettes which has been the most consistent bad habit I've had...

Anyways, I am ending day 2 and have not yet broken down, bought a pack so maybe, just maybe I can do this. 

I could not possibly have tapered down to where I am now with the other substance without a quitting community here on reddit so I thought I'd stop by here and say I am going to go for day 3 :)

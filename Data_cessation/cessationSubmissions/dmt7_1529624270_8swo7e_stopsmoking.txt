2.5 months smoke-free need a kick!

I’m so bloated! Gaining a pound a week. Sudden weight gain is making me go crazy! None of my clothes fit right, constipated all the time, my hair looks horrible, just totally discouraged. Worked out this week like crazy actually ran on the treadmill. Hate my sedentary job &amp; just feel all sorts of bleh!!! Long term quitters, any advice? Nutrition? Workouts? Cleanse? I’m at a loss! I’m doing my best here but the stress my body is undergoing. It’s just too much!

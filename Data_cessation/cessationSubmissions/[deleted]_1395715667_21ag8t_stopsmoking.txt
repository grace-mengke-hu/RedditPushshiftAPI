11 Days Since My Last Cigarette and Feel Like I'm Smoking More!

Hi guys. I've not smoked for 11 days now and my chest feels like I've been smoking more. I've got shortness of breath, major chest pains, coughing a lot. Is this a normal thing to go through when quitting? I can't seem to find a lot of info on it online.

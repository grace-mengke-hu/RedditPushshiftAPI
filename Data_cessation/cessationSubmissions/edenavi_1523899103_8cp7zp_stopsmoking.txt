This time, it's for real.

I had my last cigarette Saturday night. I've tried cold turkey before and struggled, so I'm using a low nicotine vape and tapering off. I barely even wanted my last few cigarettes, they just disgusted me. 

This time it's for real, I can tell. I don't need cigarettes or their disgusting smell on me ever again.

I decided to quit today.

I was having a my first cigarette of the day, and I was sitting in a smokers section of a shopping centre. A lady came in after I had finished my smoke and picked up all of the stepped on, dirty, used cigarettes and collected them, and began smoking them. It was disgusting. I gave her the rest of my pack (had like 5 left) and told her she should quit, and I'm not having another.
I just didn't want to be that person. So I will make a conscious effort not to. 

Wish me luck! 

Edit: thanks for all the kind words. Good luck to those of you who are quitting also!

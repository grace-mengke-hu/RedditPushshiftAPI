9 days in... extreme lack of motivation for anything?!

I quit 9 days ago. Feeling good in general, I get cravings maybe 2-3x a day, mostly because of stress triggers, but they're manageable. 

What I'm really worried about is my lack of motivation. I can't do anything but go to work, come home, lay in bed, watch YouTube, let the dogs out, go to sleep (or try). I have no zest for anything. I used to draw and read. My interest in taking a shower on a regular basis, cleaning up, etc has decreased dramatically. I've had laundry sitting in my room for a week (which is not normal for me). I'm sad to say my eating has increased 1000% haha.

I don't miss smoking more than  I do miss it, but I feel mentally and physically exhausted and unmotivated. Anyone going through or went through the same thing? Thanks :)

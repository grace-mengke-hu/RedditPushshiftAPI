Strange thought after 5 days.

Posted about 2 weeks ago, ended up failing and retrying a few days after. The current try appears to be going rather smoothly. 5 days in. That's, by far, the longest i've spent without smoking in the last 14 years.

While I definitely don't get the same types of urges for a cigarette, that breathing is already slightly better, etc... I'm starting to think sometimes and... Well I just enjoy smoking. Now that's a problem. I didnt quit because I wanted to take a turn for the healthy (originally), I quit because my SO was going to and it was going to become a logistical nightmare to be a smoker with her complaining about smell and shit. So I decided i'd quit aswell, and that, after all, it was the good decision to make.

Thing is, right now, I *really* want to go back to smoking. Not smoking seems boring as *fuck*. The only thoughts keeping me from smoking right now are: "*My SO will lose her shit.*" & "*After all the shit (headaches, dizziness, anxiety, etc...) I just had to go through, it would be dumb as hell to start again*"

Weird situation where I hope this works out... but really... but kinda. ^^^But ^^^not ^^^really. ^^^^^But ^^^^^sure!... ^^^^^^But ^^^^^^I ^^^^^^mean...

Just stopping by to tell you you're all awesome and what you are doing is worth it

Quitting is one of the hardest things I've done but it's far from impossible and it keeps getting easier. 

Please, if you are going through a hard time and the cravings hit you don't give in! Come here and post, ask questions, rant, whatever... This is one of the most helpful communities I've found and there's always someone to give you a hand.

Just to give this post some more content: I quit cold turkey in October 2013, after reading Allen Carr's book (which I hated but it's probably the book that most influenced my life). I always recommend Freedom From Nicotine as a good read, [the PDF is available for free](http://whyquit.com/ffn/). I believe cold turkey is the way to go, I think it's actually the easiest way, but if it doesn't work for you there's no shame in trying nicotine patches, vaping, nicotine gum, acupuncture, hypnosis or whatever. Trust me, quitting is the best gift you can give yourself and your loved ones.

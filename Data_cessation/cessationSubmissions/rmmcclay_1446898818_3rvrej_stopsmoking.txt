Severe Tobacco-Induced Cough Fit Before I Quit - Repost

I'm reposting this and will repost again.  I haven't coughed (except for a brief cold months ago) since I quit, over 300 days ago.  This video is embarrassing to me.

In this video I do not have a cold. I am not "sick". What this shows is a spontaneous coughing attack brought on by years of smoking. This could happen to at any time. I captured this episode accidentally when I was testing a camera's battery and didn't even realize I captured it until I happened to "scrub" through the video before deleting it.

I was shocked to see it. I didn't realize my coughing was so intense; causing my face to go completely red, gasping for breath.

I realized this is something all long-time smokers experience but we're very good at hiding our frailties. It was no good. Chronic (meaning all the time) pulmonary illness has become normal. Good god.

The video was recorded late December 2014. I quit smoking, cold turkey, about 2 weeks later in January 2015. It is now August 2015 and I have not coughed nor had such an attack since I quit. This is amazing to me. It's difficult to believe the restorative powers my body still has after such rank and long-term tobacco abuse.

I've been very reluctant to post this video here, it quite embarrasing--that I would so willing to destroy my health for the transient pleasure of smoking. I did it for years!

What a blessing that I had a second chance at living and breathing. I hope this video has some positive impact on someone.

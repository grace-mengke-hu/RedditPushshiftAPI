I fucked up.

Well, have more than two weeks without smoking, and almost 2 months reducing my daily cigarretes. Then I cut it off in one per week. Yesterday was my brother birthday and I don't know why, but start with one saying "well, is only one is ok", but go for other and other and ended in a number a clearly I don't know, maybe 9. I don't understand what happen, I was barely drinking, but started to talk about politics and then my mind blow off for the rest of the night. Even, when everybody was gone, I smoke the last cigarrete of my emergency pack. So, I don't know if I should restart and when I feel ready do it, or keep this days without smoking, and that night just was a casual moment that I can forgive me. So what do you think?

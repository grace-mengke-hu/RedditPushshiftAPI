Quit after 9 years.

Started when I was 17, from a few cigs a day to a pack a day. On nightouts I'd go through 2 packs easily, chain smoking.

Worst part is - a year ago I had pleural effusion (excess fluid outside my left lung),  it left my left lung permanently scarred, and not able to expand fully. Yet, i still failed to quit. 

Finally, I decided to quit a week ago, and it's been 4 days since my last cig. I feel great, though eating a lot more. 

I live in China, where you can buy cigs for 50 cents, and people gift each other cigarettest during weddings and special occasions. But i still feel great. 

Everytime I feel like I want a cigarette, I remind myself a few points from Alan Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking and browse r/stopsmoking. 

I know it's been 4 days only, but I know I've completely quit.

Would have been 65 days... but the batch got me.

So about two weeks ago I started smoking batch again. For those of you who don't know batch is any tobacco mixed with weed. I was good about not smoking any cigarettes at first, only batch but of course that inevitably led to my smoking of cigarettes and constant cravings for batch. I'm pretty upset with myself for ruining such a long quit but I'm back on the patch and determined to quit for good this time!

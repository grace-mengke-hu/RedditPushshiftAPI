Rough week - Another trigger faced

I posted before about relearning how to handle stuff as a nonsmoker and this week was rough.  Family drama, emotional stuff, devastating stuff that I have always dealt with by chain smoking. It would have been so easy. But I had 53 days. I managed to focus on the one good fact that I would go to bed a nonsmoker and it helped.  I am so glad I did not give in. Another tactic I have used is to think... and then what.. like, this is so bad, I want to smoke... ok suppose I do, then what?  I will want more, will have to reset my counter, will feel so disappointed, etc.  Keep on keeping on guys.  We all know life is sweeter without it.

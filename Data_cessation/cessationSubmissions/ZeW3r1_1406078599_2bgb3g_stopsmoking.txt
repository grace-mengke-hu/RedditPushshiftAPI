Well...i failed

And only after 5 days which were going so well. I'm not saying this as an excuse..well i'm just gonna say it. And sorry for my self expression it's a bit hard because english isn't my native. So, one of my most valuable friendships is going downhill hard and i just kinda got the "confirmation" that it's over, so i wen't to another friends place to talk about what had just happened. He's a smoker and he offered me one. I hadn't really told him yet that i'm serious about quitting and my mental state at that point was so messed up, so i just took it, lighted it up and immediately felt regret of doing that. It tasted bad, it felt bad, everything was bad about it. Worst thing was that i let myself down and didn't survive one bigger thing in my life without a smoke.

Going cold turkey tomorrow again. This only made me stronger. I still feel really bad, ofc but i learned a lesson. And i will stop smoking, that's for sure.

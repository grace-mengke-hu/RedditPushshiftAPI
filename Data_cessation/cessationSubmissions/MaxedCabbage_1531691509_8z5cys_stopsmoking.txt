How much is secondhand smoke going to effect nicotine in system?

I'm on my 8th day not smoking and I just had a question. I went to someone's house for a few minutes and they are a smoker and one who smokes inside. When I arrived they were on the last couple puffs and then put it out. I was in the house for like 5 minutes and when they were about to light another I was like I need to step out. I wasnt worried about the temptation, but I was worried about nicotine getting in my system. I didnt want to deal with a "reset," you know? 

Am I good? Was the amount too little to make a difference? I'm more just curious, but I am really frustrated because I didnt want to be in the situation. Now I'm going to be in a stressful situation for the next few hours and it sucks. I'm not even worried about the cravings to be honest, I just want them to be over already. Lol I'm really ready to be a non smoker and feel like one. Its just this last hump. 

What has your experience with second hand been?

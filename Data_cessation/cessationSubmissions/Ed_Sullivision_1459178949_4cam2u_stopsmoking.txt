4 weeks smoke free! but I've gained 10 pounds :(

Good News: Cravings are very minimal now. I can go out to the bars with my smoker friends and not even think about smoking. My lungs feel clear and much more healthy, my sense of smell has returned, I now realize how much my smoker friends fucking reek of cigarettes when they come back in from a smoke. I'm in love with being a non-smoker. 

Bad News: Mother fucking weight gain. I didn't even realize it was happening, but I'm some how 10 pounds heavier. Kinda sucks, was already trying to lose some weight before I quit. So much fucking work to do now...

Well that's why it wasn't working.

When I was trying to get my badge working while they were borked I unchecked the "show my flair box"  And that made me really sad because I wanted to show off my shiny 3 star.  Good thing I got that thing fixed!

I'll bet dollars to donuts my wife is keeping track even though I've been talking about it almost not at all.  If she gets me balloons I'll post pics.

Keep up the great work all!  You can do this thing!

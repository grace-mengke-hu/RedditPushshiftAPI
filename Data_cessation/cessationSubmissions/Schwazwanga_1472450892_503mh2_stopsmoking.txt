A question for this wonderful community

I've been a smoker for about 6 years now and had multiple failed attempts durning the whole 6 year period. My question to you all is this: 

Did anyone have a "no more...after this packet" approch and if so how did you go with that??

Or are there any of you who simply put out half a smoke and said "right, no more!!" And threw your your packet away.

Ive always been the "no more after this packet" smoker but always fail. Just wondering how many of you were the same but actually succeeded.

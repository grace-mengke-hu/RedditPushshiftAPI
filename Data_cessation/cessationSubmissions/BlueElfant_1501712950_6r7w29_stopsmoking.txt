Dreams

I just recently crossed 14 months.... after 9 years of a can a day grizzy habit.... one thing I noticed is that recently I keep having vivad dreams about dipping... and in the dreams I love it and i try to convince myself just 1 can is ok... I haven't given in (other then in the dream) not even a cigar.... but I was curious if anyone else had any experience in such dreams so long after quitting

Still day 1

I thought about going to the store several times now to buy cigs. I was a dick to my gf's friend, I am certainly not a nice person like I usually am atm. Right now I know I have to stay the course, however there are thoughts in my head asking myself is this worth it. Man, addiction is fucking real. Right now im trying to find the strength I need to make it through the night to the next day.

My first post...Almost 30 days

So  in a few hours, I'll hit the 30-day mark in my quit.  It was rough the first few day (as most of you know!).

As much as I hate to scare anyone just starting out, I have to say I had a surprisingly close call tonight.  Had a great day with a friend.  Beautiful fall day, fun road trip, winery, golf course, etc.

Got home in a great mood, nice dinner and BAM.  Suddenly found myself obsessing about a smoke.  I haven't had a strong craving in a few weeks.  

I sat in front of the convenience store taking deep breaths and talking to myself.  I'm sure I looked like a crazy person.

Success, I guess.  Bought a pint of ice cream but no cigarettes.  That was scary.  Didn't see that coming.  Be prepared, people!!

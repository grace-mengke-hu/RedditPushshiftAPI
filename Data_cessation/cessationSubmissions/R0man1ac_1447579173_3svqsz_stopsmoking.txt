Six days, 10 hours, 45 minutes.

I must say that I am pretty confident now that for my vacation coming up, I will NOT be sneaking away from the family and finding excuses in the hotel room to go downstairs to the car when I am craving a cigarette.

I will actually be able to ENJOY this vacation, and be able to BREATHE while doing it!

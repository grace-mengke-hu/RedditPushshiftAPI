Had a dream last night...

That I turned down a cigarette! That's gotta be a good sign since usually I'm smoking in my dreams. Going to try to break my record of one month clean! Honestly, it feels great if you just let go and enjoy every moment for what it is. 
The only thing I'm dealing with is a bit of brain fog but I'm trying to combat that with exercise and meditation. Good luck everyone.

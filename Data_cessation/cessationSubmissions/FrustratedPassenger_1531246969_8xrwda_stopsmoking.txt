OK I quit smoking by accident.

I forgot my smokes at home. Sure, I can run to the gas station during a break at work but I’ve been wanting to quit for some time. I’ve been obsessing about the gas station all day long. 

I work at a university with quite a few academic types. I keep imagining hitting them square in the face. Anger, party of one!

13 hours down...

And I just want to see that number grow. I'm using chantix and according to the directions, tomorrow is supposed to be my "quit day".  But when I got down to my last one last night I knew I wasn't going to buy a pack today only to have it last into tomorrow. 

I have one smoke left on my nightstand, but it's not an emergency or "just in case" cigarette. It's for my own motivation. I want to watch that thing yellow and then brown and go stale as my desire to smoke does the same. 

I've tried to quit before, but it was for my girlfriend and my son. Even made it a couple months on no more than a cig or 2 per day. Now I'm done because *I* want to be done. I am done. 

Half a day might not be much of a milestone, but it's a start. And every moment I go without having one is another step forward. It's another second, minute, hour and eventually day, week and year as a non-smoker. 

And that's what I am and will continue to be. A non-smoker. You are too,  even if you don't know it yet. 

Keep strong, stay positive and don't look back. I have faith in myself and in you as well.

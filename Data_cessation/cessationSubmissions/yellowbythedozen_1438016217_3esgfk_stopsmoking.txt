31 days in, and I only smoke in my sleep now.

Not that I'm sleep-smoking, but in my dreams I'll light up a smoke and take a drag. 

It's funny because in my dreams I know I've quit smoking, and I tell whomever may be there that I've quit and feel bad for lighting up. Yet the fact that I'm aware this is a dream, I figure I'll be okay just taking that one puff. 

The strange thing is the sensation in the dream of that nicotine buzz I get from that one puff in my sleep seems all too real though. 

Anyone else smoke in their sleep?

Extremely Sore throat since I quit??

Smoked heavily for about 10 years. I quit 12 days ago no not a single smoke since, however my throat is swollen badly and has been for a week. Just wondering if anyone else who quit had these symptoms. I have a doctors appointment in an hour not just counting on reddit to have all the answers this time.

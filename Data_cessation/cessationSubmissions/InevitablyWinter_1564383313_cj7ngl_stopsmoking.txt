Did you have any emotional, mental, or perceptional differences?

My name is blah, and I'm a smoker. Hi, blah.

Okay, now that's out of the way. I'm 26 years old and I've been smoking for 13 years, defined by a 3-5 months of total non smoking time. 

I feel as if smoking blunts my emotional reactions and dulls my mind. Everytime I have a strong outburst (or inburst) of a passionate nature, I smoke. Every time I become frustrated, I feel the need for a breath of unfresh air.

Over time, I've noticed that I lack any strong emotions now. Unless persistently provoked, they disperse quickly. 

I no longer can focus myself to my known potential in exercises of concentration. 

I'm not emotionless or unable to think deeply, mind you, but I can plainly see that I've been affected.

Has anyone noticed anything similar to this while smoking and/or saw a difference after they had quit?

And yes, I've read Allen Carr's book and I'm giving it another read.

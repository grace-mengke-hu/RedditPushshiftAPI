Never Quit For More Than 3 Days In 10 Years!

Hey guys,

I just wanted to tell my story i will keep it very TLDR, if by a small chance it helps someone else. I have quit smoking! i have been smoking for 10 years about 16-20 a day (8mg (winfield25 GOLD)) and another 20 on top of that for a friday and saturday night (drinking). On the 14th December 2015 i quit, i have never made it past  day 3 without champix.

i thought it was impossible. i have attempted quitting just under 50 times in 10 years, 10 of those time with NRT and 5 with Vape and twice with champix. Cold turkey was the winner with a good reason to quit. 

Biggest help:
you must have a reason to quit that means something to you. 
whyquit.com (free) - They hate NRT
being off work helped a lot! 7 days minimum 2 weeks is better.

Is it safe to smoke hookah once every few months?

So I've only smoked hookah before once which was about 4-5 months ago while watching the Champions League final. My brothers smoke it occasionally and none of them are really addicted to it. I may smoke again sometime soon but probably only once for about 30-45 minutes. I heard it is very unhealthy, but if I only smoke it like 2 times a year do I have any realistic health issues? I'm 16 years old btw if that has anything to do with it.

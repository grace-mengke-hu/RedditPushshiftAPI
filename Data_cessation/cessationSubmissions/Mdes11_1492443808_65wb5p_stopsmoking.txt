2 Years Today, Quitting for Travel :)

Honestly still can't believe we made it this far. Two years ago, my boyfriend and I started taking Champix. We decided that we were going to quit together knowing it would be hard. The day we quit smoking, we each set up automatic transfers on our bank accounts which transferred 10$ a day into a savings account (which is what we spent on cigarettes each daily.) That day, we booked a week long vacation in a private log cabin in the mountains that would be paid for by our smoking funds, and we agree'd that if either one of us smoked we would have to cancel our vacation. Six months later we got to go on our vacation fully paid for by our smoking habit. We kept saving after that and now we are both able to afford a month in Vietnam travelling the whole country (we leave in November :D) I highly recommend you try this method if you're thinking of or have already quit smoking. One cigarette is not worth cancelling our vacations and disappointing the other.

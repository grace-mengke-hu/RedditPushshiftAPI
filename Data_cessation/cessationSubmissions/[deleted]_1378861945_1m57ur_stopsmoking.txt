Five days down - much easier than I had anticipated.

Now, I'm not saying that it's been easy.  I tried quitting twice with Chantix, but relapsed both times.  Was always afraid of trying to quit cold turkey, but surprisingly, I've found it easier than quitting with Chantix.  I had a few issues with cravings on Sunday, but other than that, I've been just fine.  Perhaps I'm just lucky, but yeah, this hasn't been all that tough.

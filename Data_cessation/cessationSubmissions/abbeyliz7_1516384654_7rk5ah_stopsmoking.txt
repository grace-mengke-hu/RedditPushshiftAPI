Dropped Booze, Picked Up Smokes

So, I got sober from alcohol about 6 months ago (Woo Hoo!!), but in that time outside of AA meetings and such, I have picked up smoking, and I HATE IT. I usually have a 1 on Thursdays and 1 on Fridays, but I find myself slipping down a risky slope. 

How did y'all start to navigate tricky times?

A Rocky Mountain quitting story, and some tips.

*It's Friday night. It's been a long week. You're done work. You might be considering lighting up right now. So I figured it'd be a good time to share my quitting story; hopefully we can help keep some of those lighters cold.*

I wasn't as addicted as many others are, mostly because I hated smoking indoors. I'd go through about five cigarettes a day, on average:

* from the house to the car in the morning, finish it during the drive
* from the car to the office
* 1 at work, possibly 2
* from work to the car
* from the car to my door

I was -- and still am -- in a high-stress, high-pressure workplace with a lot of smokers. I'd get a vicious cigarette hangover and wonder how much of me smoking was desire for nicotine, and how much of it was inertia. And then I'd go back in there and make that deadline, because that was what you did.

In between stop-start attempts at quitting, this was essentially my life in tar for five or six years. 

I'm lucky enough to have friends and family who care about me, and who aren't afraid to tell me when I'm being selfish, or a shithead, or just making foolish choices. And the time came last October when I couldn't handwave their concerns away any more. Couldn't stand the look in my grandfather's eyes when he could smell it on me. It was time to try quitting again. 

Even then, I didn't know when I would quit, just that I was planning to. At some point. When I could get everything together, and spare the mental bandwidth. When the stress went down. After this next deadline. You know. When it's right.

I went on a work trip to British Columbia. Not Vancouver -- inland. Buried in the Rockies. It was a three-day trip. Fly in Tuesday morning, work Tuesday afternoon and all day Wednesday, fly back out Thursday. It was a good trip, and we got a lot done.

Evening on the second day. We've wrapped up work, tomorrow is just a travel day. I'm having a celebratory cigarette out front of the hotel, looking out over that beautiful Rocky Mountain skyline.

And I think to myself, **"Man, if this were my last cigarette, I would be perfectly happy with that."**

And then I realized what I was thinking. And then I put the pack on the bench outside the hotel doors. And then I tucked the lighter away (I still hang out with smokers sometimes, I'm not *cruel*), and I went back to my hotel room, and I ate snack food and crashed.

I didn't smoke at all the next day. I bought gum when I got home; that didn't work. **I realized I needed something that replaced the action of smoking, not just the nicotine from it.** 

Proper e-cigarettes were difficult to get at that point, so I bought a Nicorette nicotine inhaler. And let me tell you: you will hate this fucking thing. No flavour, no smoke, no flame. Just a sharp poke at the back of your throat at the end of the drag. But I used it, for weeks. I'd go out where I used to light up, and I'd have to explain to everyone why I had this dumb-looking tampon dispenser in my mouth, and oddly enough that helped too, in a way.

Fall turned to winter. I switched out my fall jacket for a winter one. And I forgot about the nicotine inhaler, tucked away in a little case in my fall jacket. And about a week into December, I realized I hadn't used it in a while. And I was through.

**TL;DR** Rather than summarize the story, I'll sum up the lessons I learned:

* **You will constantly crave. Have a reason for staying clean that's stronger than your reason to smoke.** Oddly enough, mine is "If I have another cigarette, that one in the Rocky Mountains won't be my last one anymore."
* **Sometimes, you need to replace the action of smoking, not just the nicotine.** Consider this if the gum, the patch, the book, or cold turkey aren't working. It can help.
* **Listen to the people who care about you.** They understand you. They understand you better than you understand yourself. And they've got the most invested into making sure you don't leave their lives early.

I hope this all helps. Stay strong, /r/stopsmoking. If you're here, you're already on your way.

Stop Smoking journal? Has anyone tried this?

for those following me, I have no slipped since 2/9, it's only two days but I am feeling good about it and the cravings seem to be getting under control. :)

Anyway, I heard that you can "write" your way through quitting smoking, I am not sure how this would work, has anyone done it?  How do you do it/get started?

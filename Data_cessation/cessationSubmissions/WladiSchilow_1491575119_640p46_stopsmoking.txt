Day 5

These past 4 days I have been feeling really bad - no energy, nonstop cravings - to an extent that I just went to bed after work. Last night I dreamed that I had a cigarette. I recall being confused in the dream but it was okay. Today I feel great! No headache, no drowsiness or irritable mood.
Even the cravings have stopped. Best decision ever, people! This subreddit is such a big help!

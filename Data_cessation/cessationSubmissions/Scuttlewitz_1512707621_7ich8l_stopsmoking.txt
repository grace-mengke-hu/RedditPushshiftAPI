Why the hell am I irritable this far in?

167 days in and I still feel ill at was every now and then.  Mostly I feel a discontentment that happens now and again.  I’m not sure why this is happening but it makes me think in my mind that a smoke, dip or vape would help.  I know that it wouldn’t help but I wish I could figure out where this feeling is coming from.  Anyone else have this issue?

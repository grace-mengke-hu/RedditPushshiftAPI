3 Weeks in! I need some help!

I quit for a full two weeks and then relapsed for a day (stress got the best of me). I'm happy to say that now I am on the right track and vaping with 3mg of nicotine until I hit a month, then I'm dropping down to 0! Really excited to quit, and would love to chat with those who are also trying to quit! I would love some advice on how to manage stress in a positive way rather than smoking? any advice would help!

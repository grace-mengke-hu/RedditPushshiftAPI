28 Days as a Non-smoker

It's been 28 days since my last cigarette. I quit cold turkey and haven't really had to deal with any withdrawal symptoms at all. I just decided that I didn't really need to smoke any more. It does nothing for me, really, and the healthier lifestyle only means better days ahead.

Last Smoke at 11:59pm, 12/31/15...

So far, all I have done is woken up and not had a cigarette. But everyone has to start somewhere. Also, the start of hacking up nasty crap has started, so yum!

Hopefully this time tomorrow I can scream out that my first day being quit is done.  

Here's to a powerful new year in 2016 without cigarettes!!!



Edit: I made it through my 1st day!!! Planning on going to boxing here soon, plan to whoop up on a bag and enjoy the workout sans losing my breath so much.  Thank you for all the well wishes! I am still in this fight!

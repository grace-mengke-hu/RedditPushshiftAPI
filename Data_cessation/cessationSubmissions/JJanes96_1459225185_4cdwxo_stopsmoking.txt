I quit March 24

I woke up one morning with a sore throat for about the 7-8th time this year and said to myself tomorrow I'm gonna quit. I got up the next day and bought the patches. When I got home I sat down with my roommate and had my last smoke and put the patch on. I learned the difference between needing a smoke and a habbit smoke and i don't feel the need for one.. Usually, until today. 
My boyfriend and I got in an argument just before work and when I got to work I got a smoke off of a friend. I almost gagged smoking it, for some reason that thing I used to run to when I was stressed or bored or really anything had become disgusting. So now I know I no longer even enjoy cigarettes and I think I'm going to drop the patch when I finish the ones I bought. 
I also downloaded an app called "smoke free", it has challenges or missions each day. Today's mission was to read other people's thoughts on quitting which brought me here.
I wish everyone the best of luck on their quitting journey.
My only advice is to say to yourself "do I want to start with day one again?" If you really don't, you won't touch another.
The first day is the worst day.

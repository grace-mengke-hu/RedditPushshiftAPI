It's getting easier, but...

Okay, a bit of an update: Today is the first day I haven't been spontaneously crying. It's getting easier.

But...

I quit using Allen Carr's book. It definitely had an effect on me, despite the fact that I'm a fairly skeptical person and don't usually buy into self-help. However, it sort of made me feel as though I'm not supposed to miss smoking. But I do miss it. A lot.

I'm mad at the book for telling me that I'm stupid to say that I want a cigarette. I do want a cigarette, really badly. I feel like someone (bitter, miserable, non-smoker me) has taken something important away from me (content, emotionally-stable, smoker me). I resent myself for taking this thing away from me. I feel like my whole identity has changed, and now I'm just this vindictive, cruel non-smoker version of myself who is torturing the version of myself that was actually doing pretty well in life.

Does anyone get this? I tried drinking the Allen Carr Kool-Aid because I believed the testimonials, but I couldn't keep some of it down. I do think it is normal to resent quitting, but I wonder if it is normal to feel that smoking was this important.

Thanks for listening.

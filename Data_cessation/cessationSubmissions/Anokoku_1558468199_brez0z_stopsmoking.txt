$1000

I wanted to go ahead and say thank you to everyone here. You've been a driving force and a wonderful team to stand beside. I had a big success today and I wanted to share it...

I was getting ready to go to lunch earlier and was questioning if I wanted to drive down town to pick up some Chick-fil-A for lunch instead of eating the left overs that I had brought from the dinner I had made a couple of nights before. With us currently going through the motions of purchasing a house we are really hunkering down on our spending.. So, $7 for Chick-fil-A seemed overwhelmingly expensive. 

As I was standing up from my desk to go eat my leftovers I got a notification on my phone. Its the Smoke Free APP, saying: 1 Month, 13 Days, &amp; 14 Hours... $1000 Saved.

I am so ashamed and delighted in regards to that notification. I felt pride, shame, anxiety, happiness, sadness... but needless to say, I got my Chick-fil-A.

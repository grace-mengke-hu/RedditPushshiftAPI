Yay me!

I have smoked half of my life! And eventually, last week I decided to kick the habit. Honestly I loved smoking and everything about it but I could see that it was taking a toll on my body! 
The first three days were terrible as I used to smoke almost two packs a day!!!! It felt like I'd lost a very dear friend. But right now, after a week, I can see the positive changes in my skin, breathing ,etc. but the BEST thing about NOT smoking is that you always smell nice and your hair smells of shampoo all the time!! üòÅ

Tip : I've been chewing regular gums and cinnamon sticks and it's helped me a lot with the cravings!

Starting day 8 cold turkey. Congestion?

Im going on day 8 now of no smoking (cold turkey). Ive gotten drunk twice, gone to a concert and played cars with my smoking friends tonight and have been able to stay away from the smokes. Pretty proud of myself. Anyways, the past 2 days I have woken up extremely congested. Is this part of quitting? If so, when does it stop?

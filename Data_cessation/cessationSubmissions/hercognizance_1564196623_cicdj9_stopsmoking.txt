2 years. I am elated.

So I have been a non-smoker for two years now and as an avid follower of the sub I have a few things to say: never feel bad about posting your progress, never feel bashful about telling the world you’re a non-smoker, make every craving as short as possible by avoiding triggers and if you can’t tell yourself: “one minute more”. Cherish everything else in your life. You don’t want to smoke with your friends. Truly. It does get better.

Love to you all!

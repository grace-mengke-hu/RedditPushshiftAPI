Day 36: This is what breathing is supposed to feel like!

I started smoking at 14 and smoked for 16 years before deciding to stop. It had taken over my life, and for a long time I was okay with that. I'd have a cigarette in my mouth a minute after I woke up and I'd smoke my last 10 minutes before I slept. 

I always admired people's will power and I never thought I had it in me to stop smoking. I tried, and every time I'd make my last cigarette a big deal. Like a celebration. That's what I was doing wrong. I was giving it too much importance. 

This time around, I had smoked an hour ago and I decided that was it. Friends recommended *Alan Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking* and I started reading it. I stopped halfway but by then, the book had busted every myth a smoker had. Every excuse I had given myself for not stopping earlier was now gone.

It's been a month since I last smoked and I never knew just breathing could be this good. If you're planning to stop, here's my advice.

* Don't make your last cigarette a big deal. It's not worth it.
* Don't replace it with another habit (gum, etc.). Walk instead.
* Read Alan Carr's book. It's better to not have excuses!
* Most important, be firm in your decision. You won't believe how simple things become when you put your mind to it.

For the last decade, I have abused my body in every way possible. Smoking, drinking, substance...you name it! When I turned 30 earlier this year, I decided it was time to change.

Yes, you ***might*** feel cravings the first week, you ***might*** feel sick, you ***might*** be angry - but that's it. Once you're past those first few days, life is so much better. 

I'd love for you to feel the way I do now! So see you on the other side! :)

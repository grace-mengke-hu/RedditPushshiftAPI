Sooo, it's been a year

And I forgot.  I forgot that I used to smoke.  It's not in my mind anymore, It's not even a thing for me.  I feel safe to say I am no longer a smoker.  I am fully free from the addiction of cigs.  

I do want to say thanks to this sub, I wasn't active but just knowing and being able to see people striving through this right next to me really helped.  Keep it up everyone.  If we can do this, we can do anything.

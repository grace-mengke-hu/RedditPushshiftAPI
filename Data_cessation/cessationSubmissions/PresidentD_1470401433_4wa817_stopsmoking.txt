Quit smoking and gained my nerve

There is this part in Alan Carr's easy way that had an impact on me. He discusses how smoking systematically robs a person of their courage because they know smoking is wrong but day in day out, they smoke. This was true for me. 80-90% of confrontations in the last 12 years of my life involved smoking a cigarette and not
 dealing with or resolving the problem.  This is not what I have been doing for the past 40 days. I have been talking through things confidently and immediately dealing with issues that arise. No longer am i running out for a smoke at the first sign of confrontation and dealing with it after a cig.

I let my family, friends and work know that I was quitting, everyone was supportive. For the first few days I was very irratable, but I found that speaking my mind was a good thing, no one minded too much. If I was being a dick then they chalked it up to quitting smoking and I had a pass. In a way the irratability of the first 3-5 days was like a rebirth of my personality into one where I speak my mind and work through things with people. I am very happy with this change.

Day 11 and i'm feeling so strong. But, I just took adderal for the first time since quitting and I want one soooo bad!!!

Anyone have this happen to them?  I have to have a cough drop in my mouth to suck on at ALL TIMES or I'm gonna smoke and i REALLY don't want to!  I need this shit to be able to function and stay focused at my job...I really wish I didn't-I feel antsy and ready to blow!

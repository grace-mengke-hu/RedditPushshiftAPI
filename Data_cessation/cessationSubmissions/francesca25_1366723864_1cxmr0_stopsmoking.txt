When do the friends stop teasing after they learn about me quitting smoking?

Today, my friends literally tried to shove a cigarrete to my mouth, after I told them I have quit. For an hour, they would smoke in my face and wave the cig before my eyes. Yesterday was the same. This is tiring, trying to explain to them that I am on the good path and I want to stay in here. They would keep coming up with pros to keep smoking. What do I say, what do I do? When do they understand that they are trying in vain and that I am not going to give in to the temptation?

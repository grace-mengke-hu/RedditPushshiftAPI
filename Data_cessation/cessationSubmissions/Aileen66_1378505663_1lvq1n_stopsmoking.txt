My boyfriends lack of support!!!

This I's my 5th day of not smoking, been wee bit tough but havnt asked or expected extra attention or support from my partner, so, he is a non smoker, and I didn't smoke in front of him, but he comes round tonight  and instead of telling me how well I've done, tells me didn't empty ashtray in garden, I havnt been there since trying to quit, but what's the point in either!!!! Rant over, and still didn't have one.

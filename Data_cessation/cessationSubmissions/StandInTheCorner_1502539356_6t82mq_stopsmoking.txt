It is all out War

I have been planning this for 6 weeks after a bout of pneumonia. Today is the day the war begins. My Willpower vs. My Smoking Demons. 5 hours in, Willpower is winning
The problem is keeping the patch on my arm. Band aid and sellotape will do for today until I get surgical tape tomorrow. It is so hot and sweaty here in The Philippines.

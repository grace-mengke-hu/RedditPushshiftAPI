Today is day one!

I've been a pack a day smoker for over half my life. It's a habit that I mostly enjoy until recently.  I was standing outside on my porch, shivering, being beating down by cold wind and a light misty rain, getting chilled to the bone and I asked myself why I was doing this.  I realized at that moment that only about 5 times on any given day did I smoke a ciggerett to enjoy the smoke, the other 15 or so times were just to feed an addiction.    Coincidently a good friend was accidentally shipped a years supply of wellbutrin instead of the 3 months that they ordered.  I was on the stuff a few years back and it helped me quit then for almost 6 months so I asked if I could have a 3 month supply.  If I had not been prescribed the drug once before I wouldn't have asked.  Anyway today makes the 14th day of taking wellbutrin so its time to quit.  Wish me luck and I will be back for help and support.

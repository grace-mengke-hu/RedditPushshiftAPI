3 days 20 hours | relapse (quite)

I got back from school taking care of documents. I was frustrated with discussing with the faculty. I walked out and thought about smoking. I did. But I had 3 puffs. And threw it away. I'll still consider it as no cigarette day.

Something changed. Yes I had an urge. Had 1. But my mind was telling me NO.

It was just my body telling me I needed it. It made sense. I get the drill. You don't really need it. I thought I needed it. But when I had it. It didn't feel right anymore.

Damn. It's really a mindset. Isn't it.

Any advice and tips guys.

Share your story where you wanted one cigarette. What happened and what did you do to prevent it from happening again.

(BTW, your stories are really helping me out. I can relate. It's difficult to base everything on facts and science. I want people to talk to about it that are experiencing the same thing I'm dealing with.)

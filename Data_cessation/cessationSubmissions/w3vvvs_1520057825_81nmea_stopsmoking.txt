7 days yesterday!

7 days yesterday! Went out drinking with some friends &amp; while I was very tempted (as the only now non-smoker) of the group, I held it together and didn't touch the shitty cancer sticks. I feel like the worst is over &amp; I'm really excited to live my life without constantly worrying about disease &amp; smelling like shit all the time. :)

I’m 26, smoked for about 8 years, more recently about 5-7 cigarettes a day. I’m 4 days and 6 hours smoke free.

Before I quit I started going to the gym about 3-4 times a week with my coworker, who is pretty athletic and fit. We would normally do the stair master or something fun for cardio, but some how or other we switched over to the treadmills, and THAT was hard. I was so out of breath and I knew it was from smoking!
I had already been wanting to quit, but wanting to be able to keep up was that extra kick in the pants to really go through with it. I have never felt so motivated to quit! This is the longest without a cigarette I have ever been, and I tried the gum a few times when I was really craving a smoke (in the car specifically), but I know I’m not going back. I feel great and crazy and craving a freaking smoke all at once.
I haven’t felt physically ill but just kind of weird and in a fog... Sometimes irritable. Exercise helps a LOT. Do the cravings ever go away? How do you start feeling after a week or so?

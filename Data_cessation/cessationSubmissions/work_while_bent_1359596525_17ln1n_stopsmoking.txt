Time for me to quit.

I've been smoking for a little over 10 years now (I'm 30 years old). Started with Djarum Blacks, but moved to Camels after the family tobacco act made djarum changed up their smokes. anyway, I've never had breathing problems from smoking, I don't have a smoker's cough, but what I do have is high blood pressure.

155/90 to be precise.

Doc put me on prescription blood pressure pills and told me I've got to get more exercise, eat less sodium and carbohydrates, and quit smoking.

So today, the 30th of January 2013, I quit.

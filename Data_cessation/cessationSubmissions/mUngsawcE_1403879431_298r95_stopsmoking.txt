Made it 2 days

Just starting day 3 here.  Day 1 was off the wall but i made it.  Day 2 was way more chill.  However, i want a cigarette no matter what mood im in.  Its crazy.  My roomate told me that addiction is like a pedophile and youre a kid.  It just wants to be in you haha.  Dont let it in you know matter what.  Ahahaa

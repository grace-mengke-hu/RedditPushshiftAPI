Will complete 2 months of quit today

I'm very proud of myself that this time I will be completing 2 months of quit. 
Had been to a general body check up yesterday was surprised to see the blood pressure had dropped to normal. It was always on the higher end for me. Imagine in just two months this could happen how much healthier I can become.
Only downside of this quit is I have gained 10 kilos of weight. But hey we can always reduce our weight. But will never quit my quit. 
Thanks for all ur support guys so far.

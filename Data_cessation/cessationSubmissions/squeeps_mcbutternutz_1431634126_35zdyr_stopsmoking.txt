One hour and counting

Killed my pack a little bit ago at work and I was perusing an /r/trees post about someone quitting drinking. One thing led to another and I find myself linked here from a comment there. I've smoked damn near a pack a day for 5 years (I'm 25 now), and I'm ready for this crappy habit to be gone. I have a baby on the way on and I never want my child seeing me with a cigarette hanging from my mouth. Also, I just moved and getting my belongings up the stairs was a pain in the ass. Way more than it should have been, anyway. So, I come here to tell you all, I've made it one hour. Although it's not much, every journey starts with a step. Any help that you guys can give would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

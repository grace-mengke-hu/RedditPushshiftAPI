I just can't.

Im on day 3 and i know i'm gonna go back to smoking in a week or so. Maybe more. I quitted because i have this memory of waking up in the middle of the night and have this horrible full of smoke first breath of the morning. Do you know that feeling? When you are sleeping and have a breath just to notice your throat is flooded with leftover smoke? It's just nauseating. I can't forget about this. But i know in a couple of weeks i'll be smoking again, after i forget about this. 

The coolest thing about not smoking is that i can see the yellow stains on my fingers dissapear for a while.

Sunday at 7:30-ish p.m. will mark my fourth year of smoke free living, and I just want to tell anyone on the fence or in the early stages: IT'S SO WORTH IT.

I smoked my last cigarette at about 7:27 p.m. on November 23 of 2010, and tomorrow a dear friend of mine is going to join me on the smoke-free bandwagon so we can mark the anniversary together going forward. 

I got to thinking about how happy I am for him and about how much my life has improved since I quit. My health is better, I can snowboard without gasping for air and I don't smell like expensive poison. Also, the extra 7K and change has been nice. 

So, if you are getting ready to quit or have just quit and are struggling, I promise you that life without cigarettes is streets-are-paved-with-gold-wonderful. 

Good hunting fellow quitters!

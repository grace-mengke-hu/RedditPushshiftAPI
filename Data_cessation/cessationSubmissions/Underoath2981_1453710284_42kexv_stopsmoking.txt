80 hours and I'm doing well.

My flair is wrong, I started smoking again and quit roughly 3 times since then. I made it to the three day mark now though and my splitting headache has gone away. I never made it this far before so that's cool. My circulation seems to be super shitty since I quit though and I feel like I have to massage my hands sometimes because they start to darken. I know it'll get better with time, but I don't remember this while I was smoking.

third day cold turkey, and overcome with rage

The actual not smoking part has been way easier than it has been during previous attempts, however the last three days have been filled with the most ridiculous, overpowering, irrational rage towards just about anything and everything. It's kind of frightening and definitely upsetting, because this doesn't feel like me. I don't feel like the process of quitting smoking has revealed a monster that's been hidden by nicotine, but rather, the lack of chemicals that I've been taking in regularly for the past 12 or so years is turning me into this person.

To others who have experienced this: does it go away? how do you cope with and/or fight it? How long does this last?

Thanks in advance

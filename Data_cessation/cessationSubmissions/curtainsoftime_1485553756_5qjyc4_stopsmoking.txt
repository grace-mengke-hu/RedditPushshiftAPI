Quitting again after four months smoke-free

Just as the title says. I quit for four months, thought that I could have just one, then bought a pack. Threw out the pack and all my lighters and am back to square one. Kind of sucks that I have to start all over but I'm confident it will be easier this time. I got through the worse before and I can do it again.

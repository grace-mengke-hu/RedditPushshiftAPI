Waiting for the other shoe to drop

Hi all! I am 26 (F) and have been smoking off and on since 17...finally decided it's time to try to kick the habit. I read Allen Carr's easy way and made it almost 3 days before going on a business trip and buying a pack. I only smoked half of it and then gave that half away before coming back though. 

It's been 3 days since coming back, and it feels weirdly easy. Like I am waiting for the horrible cravings  or agony to start. In the back of my mind I'm kind of thinking 'well I was able to stop again after that business trip...so maybe that will just be my thing...'. That line of thinking is kind of worrying me, but if I stay quit until my next trip (end of August) I'm hoping I just won't want to ruin my streak. 

Not sure how to format, so sorry if this is all just a big paragraph. Also not sure if I have a point here, just some general musings. Has anyone ever had this 'it's too easy...' feeling while in the first few days of quitting? How should I navigate with business trips? I haven't done any vaping or e-cigs...maybe they would be a good idea? TIA everyone, reading stories here really helps!

Lapse or a full blown relapse?

I thought that I can smoke one. I couldn't. One after another, pack after pack, I am almost a month into my relapse. I really want to quit again but I can't make myself to do it. When I remember the crisis and the cravings, I just don't want to go through that again. But the guilt is eating me up. Any advice would be helpful ðŸ™ˆ

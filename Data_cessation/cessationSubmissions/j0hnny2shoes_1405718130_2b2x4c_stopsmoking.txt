5.5 Days!

Thank you guys so much. Searched this sub for people with similar symptoms while they were quitting and it gave me the courage to go on. Was a can a day dipper (yes I know, wrong sub, but /r/StopDipping is not that active) and the second day my body just shut down. Could hardly move. But now I'm feeling so much better, a little off when it comes to concentrating on certain tasks and want a lip more than anything right now, but I'm gonna see this through. Really excited for the day where I don't think about it at all. It's been the first time in a long time where I've been proud of my self.

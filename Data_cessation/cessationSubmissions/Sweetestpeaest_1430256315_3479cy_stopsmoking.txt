Tips for quitting smoking?

My SO and I have done a great job at eating healthier and getting some exercise in during the week to improve our lives. We haven't kicked smoking yet....and, honestly, we haven't really talked about it. We've mentioned here and there that we know we should quit and all that, but we haven't made a real plan and I think that's what we need. Any idea of where to start? Any advice is appreciated!

Quit for 850 days, then fell off the wagon. Here to get back on.

Hey r/stopsmoking! Over 2 years ago, I successfully quit cold turkey after many things kept adding up that showed me I really needed to quit. 

I started again in a moment of confidence, not despair, surprisingly. Over the past 2 years, I've dealt with the stresses of grad school, had a relative shot and killed by the police, lost my future father-in-law, had a colleague commit suicide, had a cervical cancer scare that is still at the "highly precancerous you need to have a biopsy every 6 months" stage, and got in a bad car wreck that left me with permanent nerve damage that causes me to be in pain every day (no opiates for me, man, fuck that shit). Not one of those moments made me crave a cig. Then 3 weeks ago, I thought that because I had been so strong through all the crap over the past 2 years, that I could become one of those "occasional" smokers. Boy was I wrong. 

It's been 3 weeks but I already feel like shit again. I do Muay Thai and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and it's so hard again, I feel like a beginner (plus who wants to spar or roll with someone who smells like shit?) My new car (I got an upgrade after the accident totaled my old one) smells awful. I still make shit money and still can't afford to smoke. AND it even makes my nerve pain flare up (dunno how, maybe that's psychosomatic?)

I know I can't quit again alone. I've got 4 left in my pack. After that, I'm going to the lowest dose patches for two weeks, then done. I already have tons of gratitude for you guys in advance. And for those of you who've never quit before, let me tell you, being a nonsmoker really does feel fucking fantastic. 

EDIT: I might also mention that I had been smoking since I was 17 when I quit the last time (at age 24).

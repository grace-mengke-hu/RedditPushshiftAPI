Been heart broken is one of the worst moments to quitting smoking

I went to hang out with some friends...I saw my crush..we did not exchange words...not even eye contact. I left early from the place because It was killing me...all the way home I just wanted to smoke. When I feel heart broken I feel like nothing matters, life has no meaning...why not smoke and enjoy a bit pleasure...all I have is pain...But then, I reflect that this pain is just temporary..and that things will get better. You have to have faith, Faith that tomorrow will be better and that quitting smoking will pay off in the long run.

101 days - feeling better every day

Exactly 101 days ago, right down the hour, I smoked my last cigarette. I knew weeks before I needed to quit and was trying to "edge" myself off of it but something clicked. I felt sick to my stomach and wanted nothing more than to be better. I threw up, picked myself up off my bathroom floor, and tossed out my just-purchased pack of smokes. 

Within the hour, I was fidgety. Six hours, stressed out of my mind. 12 hours, I felt like I was going to explode. Over the next few days I suffered from extreme irritability and Quitter's Flu. I thought my life was going to be over (read: I was gonna go on a killing spree - everyone who has quit smoking knows this feel). 

By the end of the week, the clouds parted and let the sun shine through. I could start to breath again and food was tasting better than ever. Admittedly I've gained a few pounds (not sure if because good food or change in metabolism), but that's stage 2 of Project Better Me. Few months later, I rarely get cravings. Even today they're still there, but I no longer start digging for my pack of Nicorette gum. 

I never thought I'd survive quitting. As much as it doesn't seem like it, especially during the first week or two, it really does get easier each and every day. And believe me, if I can do it - so can you.

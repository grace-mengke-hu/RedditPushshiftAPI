Taking Zyban

I'm not fully quit yet, but this medication seems to starting to work. I find myself with a dry mouth often, and a weird taste after each cigarette. I also seem to get hiccups after each one? The cravings aren't as bad, and I'm mostly smoking out of habit. I can feel myself slowly losing interest in the activity. I just need to get over this insomnia, heh. I tried the second step on the patches, but it turns out I'm allergic. Seems like such a waste of medicine... I wonder how much weight I'm going to gain.

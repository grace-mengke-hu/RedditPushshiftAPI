Quitting - once again

I feel awful. 

Last fall I quit smoking for 9 months (Not a baby-thing - just a coincidence). This spring I started AGAIN because apparently I'm an idiot :( I thought that "smoking just one cigarette doesn't make the difference..." but one became two, two became a pack and so on. So here we are - almost 7 months later - trying to quit again.... 

1d 6h and some minutes since I smoked last time. Wish me good luck. I have a strong feeling I'll need it xD

I caved :(

I was 86 days smoke free and tonight I've gone and bought a pack. 

Rant ahead:

Instead of focusing on my meditation as I've started doing. 
I was stuck at work (at an emergency services call centre) and took a call from a guy who had just walked in to find his girlfriend dead after hanging herself. I tried doing this on NYE last year, and it hit home and now all I want to do is smoke like a mad woman! 

So mad at myself!

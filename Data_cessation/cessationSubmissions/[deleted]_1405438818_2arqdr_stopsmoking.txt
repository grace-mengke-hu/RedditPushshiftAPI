Success with prescribed stop smoking drugs?

I turn 28 on July 31st. I've smoked since 14-15 and been at a pack a day since my senior year of high school. I've tried to quit a handful of times with the longest being a couple months 2 years ago. I've done cold turkey, lozenges, the patch. I've never actually been able to break away from the NRT. 

My roommate told me last week that the doctor had prescribed her Wellbutrin to help her quit smoking. I knew this was used sometimes as my dad was also prescribed Wellbutrin by the navy when he quit. I want to try it, but I feel awkward for some reason walking into the doctors office and asking for an anti-depressant. Do you just go to the doctor and say "I need help quoting smoking". I'm also terrified ad Chantix so I won't be doing that. Even the patch gave me terrible nightmares. 

I guess I just want somebody to tell me something helped so I can give this another shot.

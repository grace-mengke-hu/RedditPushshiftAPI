Need suggestions for quitting with a partner

Hello!

My lady and I have been struggling for months to try and quit. So far we've only gone cold-turkey, with varying degrees of success. I went for about 60 days before I re-lapsed, and she made it about 40. 

Lately we've been having more and more re-lapses. She's having an especially hard time because her job, combined with school starting back up and a very needy family (who all smoke), tends to stress her out, so it causes her to slip. I've been struggling myself with similar reasons; stress on the job, etc. 

We've been trying herbal supplements like Valerian Root to help calm the nerves to (hopefully) curb cravings, but lately it doesn't seem to help. I was thinking about trying the patch, but they're so expensive!

Do any of you have any tips or advice for a duo trying to beat this thing as a team?

91 Days! Using two simple words...

STOP IT

Hilarious, but there's a certain hard truth to this video that really worked for me. 

Every time you want one or are having a 'fit', just STOP... and listen to Bob Newhart say, in your head:

"You don't want to die early? Do you?"

The answer will always be 'NO'.

Then listen to Mr. Newhart's advice:

STOP IT

Of course, this is NOT where I started. I quit, relapsed, quit, relapsed and quit... many, many times. 
But I kept quitting and didn't stop.
So don't stop quitting!

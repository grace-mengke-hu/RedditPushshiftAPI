First successful day

I've been a SMOKER past 450 days. Minimum half pack and sometimes it goes up till one and a half. SHE didn't want me to smoke. Read Allen Carr's 11 paragraphs yesterday which properly told me why I ain't able to stop smoking. Made up my mind not to and the first day. Feels bad but awesome too

Can quitting really be this easy after 30 years ?

I had my last cigarette Saturday night June 4,2016. (I smoked 10-15 a day)  For the past 2 weeks I've been taking 150mg of Wellbutrin twice a day. I've never taken any antidepressants before but I do feel as if I have a better sense of well being.

I applied my first Nicoderm CQ 21mg patch Sunday morning. All day yesterday I had zero cravings..none. This morning again..even with my ritualistic morning coffee..no craving at all. 

Now I understand I'm still feeding the nicotine monster but if I follow the 6 week plan then step down to 14mg, then down to 7mg, I think I may actually be able to accomplish this goal.

I'm curious if any of you that successfully quit smoking used Wellbutrin & nicotine patches. Based on how I feel right now, I am very confident that I'm going to be able to do this. The strange part is I feel like I don't have to try too hard. I hope that it stays like this throughout the entire process.

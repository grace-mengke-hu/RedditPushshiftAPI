Help me from this shit

I have stopped smoking a million time and I always after a week or two just fall into it again. I enjoy smoking but hate myself for doing it. I really want and wish I could be like other people who don't smoke. But I cannot do it.
Do you know if the is some supplements that can help me or reduce my desire to smoke? Nicotine gums and vaping don't do the trick for me and just make me crave cigarettes even more:/

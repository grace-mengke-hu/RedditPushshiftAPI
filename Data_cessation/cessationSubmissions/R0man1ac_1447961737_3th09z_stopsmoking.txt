Day 11. I feel great.

Today I woke up next to my boyfriend and was able to lay in bed with him without thinking of getting up to smoke. Took a deep breath, and felt no heavy chest pain. I didn't wake up coughing. 

I feel good today. It's my day off and I am heading out to the football stadium to see our team play. I won't be worried about leaving early to go and smoke! No missing half of the game that I paid good money to watch, just so I can go hang out with a cigarette. 

I'm so glad I finally made the decision to do this again. I'll never go back to smoking. I feel too good. I'm not going to make another post until two weeks. I just needed to tell everyone how great I am feeling today. :) 

To those of you just starting, or right where I am - we can do this.

Day 1...

So, I had my last cigarette last night. Today is my first full day as a nonsmoker. It has been a rough day but mostly because I am really struggling to stay on my diet. 

I am feeling pretty positive at the moment about not smoking, but, man, would I kill for some Phish Food... every time I want a cigarette I have been able to talk myself out of it but it usually just leads to me eating something. It is harder to talk myself out of eating things right now...

I am not feeling great physically. I know it is just my body trying to get clear of it but I have a headache, I am tired yet antsy, I keep coughing up stuff, and I am very irritable. All that said: I don't have to leave the house again so I can just cocoon for the rest of today and hope tomorrow is better...

I just needed to share...

Thanks for just being here...

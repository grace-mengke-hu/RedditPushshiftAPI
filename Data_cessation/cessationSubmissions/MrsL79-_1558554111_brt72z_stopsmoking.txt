Help

Hello my Stopsmoking Friends, I am in desperate need of Help and ideas, Five days ago a Very Dear Friend of mine came into town . I hadn’t seen her for a Very long time and with 10 months Smoke Free we began having some cocktails and after the second cocktail I thought I could smoke just that evening with my friends and I would be Okey to go back to not Smoking the next day. I couldn’t!!!!!!! That was five days ago and the cravings to smoke are unbelievably strong. This is harder to get started then I remember it being the first time I Quit. Please Help Me!!!! If anyone has any ideas or personal advice to get started again PLEASE let me know your story or idea. I just can’t do it this time. I am a mess with the shame of it .

Traveling solo tomorrow and nervous of relapsing

Hi everyone,
I’m almost at the 6 month mark cold turkey in less than a week.  But I’m traveling tomorrow for a few days by myself for the first time since quitting, and getting nervous, since I haven’t had to go through this scenario yet.  When I was smoking, regularly or casually (or what I thought of as casually), I always used to write off traveling as okay to smoke — since I was out of my regular habitat.
Has anyone else had this issue? If so, how to best circumnavigate?
Thank you for reading in advance.

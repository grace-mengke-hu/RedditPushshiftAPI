Just found this sub

I had quit once before for six months prior to joining the military, but once boot camp ended I jumped right back on the band wagon. Now I've been tobacco free for two months since I made a new years resolution and a promise to many people including myself and my loved ones and I've held onto it. You can do it. I've quit twice now, in some unique ways that I won't disclose here. So if you need some advice feel free to PM me.

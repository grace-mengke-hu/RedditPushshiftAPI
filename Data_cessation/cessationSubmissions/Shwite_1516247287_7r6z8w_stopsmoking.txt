Sign of progress

So I used to light up a cig after smoking a bowl to sort of hide the smell and it just sounded nice. I didnt realize how much of a habit I had formed out of that. So when I first quit cigs I would crave one immediately after the herb. But today I didn't even think of cigarettes until a while later and the urge is weak. So things are going well

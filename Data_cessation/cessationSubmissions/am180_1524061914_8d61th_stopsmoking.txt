Does anyone know how I can get off of a few cigarette mailing lists?

I think I ended up signed up for Camel, Marlboro, and American Spirit mailing lists at some point. I'm having trouble figuring out how to get my name off of them so I stop getting those coupons in the mail. Has anyone had any luck with this?

To the lurkers and the on the fencers...please

Do it now!! Quit!! I got the phone call this morning...the one no one ever wants to get.  My mom, a heavy smoker for at least 40 years...lung cancer.  Smoking is one of the most selfish things we did/do.  She is will be leaving 2 children and four grandchildren.  For what? Because it was hard to quit? Too fucking bad!! If you're reading this and you're deciding if quitting is for you...DO IT!! Yes, it will be hard but it will be worth it!!! For you quitters...STAY QUIT!! There is nothing good there on the end of a cigarette...My mom is only 57... I've been a wreck all damn day...I don't know how to do this...Think of everyone who loves you..or who you love..do it for them!! Do it for yourself!! Just please...quit.

I feel like i'm dying, are acceptable losses a thing?

tl;dr on the bottom

Let's start by saying i quit smoking two months ago, after the first week or so i almost stopped thinking about cigarettes.

Fast forward to this week, i started feeling really unwell. Things are going down the shitter.
My father has been in and out of the hospital in the past month, and is now at home, constantly feeling really unwell; 

My social life is suffering since i stopped smoking, for i didn't want to stay close to smokers while i was bored, fearing relapses; 

I will have a really important exam i spent alot of money on in a couple of months, and i'm LITERALLY YEARS behind schedule;

My cat is not very well either, and while this might seem like an unimportant detail, caring for her is the single reason i got out of depression some years ago.

Adding insult to injury, i am worried about my brother for developing a bad cough, after decades of smoking.

Now i'm starting to feel really bad too, as stress is eating away from me: shortness of breath (confirmed non physical issue), talking to myself, crying &amp; screaming for "no reason".

Now, i'm sorry to bother you with backstory, but it felt like it was necessary with the main question:

(tl;dr:) Is it ok to light one up after months for really heavy stress? I really feel like it could help and i will stop again just after.

Using a Ecig to try and quit, don't think its helping. Advice?

So I thought a Ecig would help with cravings. Last time I tried to quit I lasted 2 days(patch) .

I'm 6 days right now but, this just doesn't help. Its 3 am and I just want a smoke. This only seems to help with the, I don't know, physical (I have something to hold between my fingers and  take a hit from?) And nothing else.

Any suggestions?  I'm already a insomniac but its hitting me hard now and I want to steal my roommates smokes so bad.

Edit: and the damn things blinking! I smoked a whole cartridge in a day! I only smoked 7 cigs a day and I blow through a cartridge in a night? WTF?

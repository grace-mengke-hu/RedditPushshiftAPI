16th day of being smoke and nicotine free!

Just wanted to share with you guys about my progress. It's day 16 now of not smoking and I have to say I think I'm starting to feel more normal now. Still a bit constipated for sure but acid levels have adjusted and I can digest fine now even without nicotine as a stimulant. I don't find myself out of breath just as quickly as I used to, I'm sure that my lungs are gradually healing and will be for a while.

I don't really crave cigarettes anymore, haven't gotten drunk yet since quitting but went out for a beer with some friends and had no problems in terms of cravings. 

I am currently using an e-cig with a cigarette-style pull (The Aspire Nautilus X  tank) with 0mg nicotine, been using it since Day 4 (after the initial 72 hrs) and things have been good.

I actually find that I rarely ever reach for my e-cig nowadays, only if I have to kill time while waiting for the bus or if all my friends are smoking I need to be doing something instead of staying inside while they all go out and just sitting alone.

Hopefully I never introduce nicotine and smoking into my life again, but I think I'm definitely way past the worst of the withdrawal from quitting.

To everyone who is currently going through withdrawal symptoms and are thinking it's way too damn hard - I promise you, it will get better.

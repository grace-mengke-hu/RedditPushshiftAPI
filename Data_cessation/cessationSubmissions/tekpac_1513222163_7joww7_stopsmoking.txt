Going on a trip with friends of 18 years for a graduation celebration in 5 days, I’m going on day 2 tomorrow and doing well! Kind of worried about my trip though.. Any advice?

I’m sick of this addiction’s control on me. So I’ve made the resolution to quit. Right now, the financial aspect is my biggest motivation.. but I get paid in 2 days so... 

I’m headed out on a trip this weekend where I know there will be a ton of situations where I will think, “a Newport would be perfect right now.” 

It is a graduation celebration for a friend of 18 years so there will be a lot of partying and drinking, and I can down a pack in a night if I’ve sipped enough. 

Any body have any experiences in situations like this and how you were able to stay strong and avoid smoking?

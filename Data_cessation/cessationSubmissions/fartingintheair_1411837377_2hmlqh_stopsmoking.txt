Worked thirds, drank a few beers, preparing for tests....I've not wanted cig this bad in awhile...

Which is exactly why I can't. I've put too much time into this to give up over a worthless puff of something that's only gonna leave me wanting more. I've smoked since I was 15, and quit a couple months ago and I'm 21. I've quit so many in my life, and I've finally realized how senseless it is. Just thought I'd share. Stay strong out there! It's not worth it, in any way!

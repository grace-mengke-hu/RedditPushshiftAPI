Awww yeah. One more achievement

So I waited for this moment for a while and now I've passed 2 months. I had a chance to give away my cigarettes from the pocket of my jacket I've had all the time during those 2 months.

I was always stressed about not having cigarettes so I thought that if I will have those with me, I will simply have no choice but just decide not to smoke. There will be no moment then I will be craving for a cig and not having them will help me. I wanted a full experience and so I got it :D

Giving away that pack I had for 2 months was kinda like missing something valuable but I really dont need it anymore to prove myself anything. Now I feel completely free. What a strange feeling only such a short period of time.

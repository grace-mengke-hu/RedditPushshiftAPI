72 hours completed and I realise now that smoking was the cause for my anxiety all along.

I fell into the trap of thinking smoking was relaxing and calmed me down and it was the reason I stuck with it for so long. I'd been smoking more and more recently and was becoming a nervous wreck. Everything made me anxious and I had no idea why, was constantly in fight or flight over the smallest thing and struggled sleeping because I'd lie in bed with a racing heart and shaking. 

Put down my last one over 72 hours ago and I've not felt a jolt of anxiety or panic since. Breathing feels 10x better, can't remember tasting and smelling this clearly before and my skin already feels a lot smoother. Can't imagine how great I'll feel once the tiredness/fatigue/insomnia passes!

24 hours no tobacco

Well I did it, I have been weaning off real slowly and today marks the first day in god knows how long without any form of tobacco or nicotine! I feel amazing when im not going thru about 20 min of the most intense cravings ever...and besides hurting in the lung area and some other minor pains that started i feel so alive again and I've been told that it keeps getting better and better the longer you stop for this is so awesome!

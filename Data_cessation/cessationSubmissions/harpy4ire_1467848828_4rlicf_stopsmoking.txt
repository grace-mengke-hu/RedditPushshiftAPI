Chilling with smoker friends?

Tomorrow will be my seventh day quit, it'll also be my first day hanging out with smokers. Any tips? I don't plan to drink, I know that's something that will screw me over. I plan to stay inside the whole time too, no going out with them. But I do know me, I can be very shy and often used cigarettes as a social buffer/escape. Anyone got any tips for dealing with it?

Edit for clarity: I'm talking about tips for dealing with the cravings. I have no intention of smoking, i do plan to leave if it gets to that point. But id rather learn to deal with it than have to keep running away from friends and social events

Just took the patch off

I've only really been a heavy smoker for about six or seven years. Last year, I got tired of the yellow teeth and not being able to exercise fully. I grabbed the patches and successfully quit for five months (they do work). Treated myself to a teeth whitening. Then a major stressor came up about four months ago, and I went back to smoking. Decided it was in my best interest to quit again seven weeks ago, and I grabbed the patches again.

As of twenty minutes ago, I still had one on. I'm on the Step 2 phase. But after going back and reading all those quitting smoking timelines, I abruptly decided I didn't just want the tobacco chemicals out of my system, but that I wanted nicotine out, as well, so I can start getting some of the heart and blood pressure benefits as soon as possible. So I took it off.

Anyone know if this is a good idea or not? Even though I haven't smoked in two months, I get a craving here and there, but they're not very pronounced. I think the patches (especially the highest dose) was actually giving my body more nicotine than if I was just smoking. I tend to take short puffs and not inhale completely. More of an oral fixation and something to do.

Has anyone else done this? Quit the patch cold turkey, haha? Did you have success?

Thanks in advance.

For those who use the patch...

When it's as hot as it is, how do you stop your patch from falling off? I put one on not even an hour ago and the adhesive went to crap because it's hotter than hell, I don't want to blow through all of my patches because it's hot asf outside. Any advice is appreciated  :)

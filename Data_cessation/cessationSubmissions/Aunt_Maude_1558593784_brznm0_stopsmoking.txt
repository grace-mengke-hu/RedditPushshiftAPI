I could fucking murder a smoke

I don't know if this will even be posted, and tbh I don't really care. I'm just typing this to keep my fingers busy til this craving passes. I'm over 3 months but not sure how far over, I have an appointment with the doc tomorrow to check on my pulmonary artery disease, which for you all that don't know, its that gangrene foot pic you see on your cig packets. Nice.

Thanks for listening, and I'm glad I'm still here, and I'm glad you are too.

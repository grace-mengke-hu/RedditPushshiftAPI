It's been a long time...

It's been over a year since I've quit, haven't had a single puff. The urge the past couple of weeks has been so strong to start back and i think i know why.  I don't know what to do with myself anymore, trying to stop bored eating or emotional eating makes me want cigarettes again. What do normal people do with their emotions?

Images of smoking in TV/Movies = Cravings Forever?

I'm over a month into my most recent quit.  For the most part, my cravings are gone.  I started watching The Man in the High Castle (great show!) which is set in the past when smoking was very common everywhere.  Pretty much every scene has someone smoking a cigarette.  It drives my cravings nuts sometimes.  Will this cease over the long term?  Or will images of people smoking in TV and Movies always cause cravings (i.e. can our brains be de-programmed)?  Thanks!

3 weeks of pure air

I owe you people a big thank you. I started lurking here about a month ago, just casually looking at ways people had succes with stopping smoking. Three weeks ago I read the book by Allen Carr, seeing as it came highly recommended in this sub, and being sceptical a book would do me any good I figured i’d give it a try. If it doesn’t help at least it can’t do me any harm. 

Today I’ve been smokefree for three weeks, and it’s been an amazing voyage so far. Yes the first days sucked but honestly I knew the cold turkey  approach would be the only thing that would work for me. Weaning off only prolonged the pain and never worked before. 

The physical side of the withdrawal is over soon enough but the confronting part was how much I had made this vice into a part of my personality. I’ve smoked the equivalent of a pack a day in rollups for over 15 years. I started when I was 15 and am 30 today. It’s a bit over half my lifetime that I’ve used cigarettes as a coping mechanism. Boredom, agitation, routine or the rebellious image (the “Yes, I know smoking is horrible for me but you can’t tell me what to do”-mentality) was all handled with a smoke. Today I’ve been reclaiming my true self and relearning healthier ways for all of these situations. It’s been hard and it’s not over yet, but with some mindfulness and a whole lot of patience it’s getting better everyday and reforging myself as a stronger, healthier and happier individual is well worth it.  So hang in there, no matter what part of your journey you’re at. You’re awesome and it’s been high time you treated yourself as such!

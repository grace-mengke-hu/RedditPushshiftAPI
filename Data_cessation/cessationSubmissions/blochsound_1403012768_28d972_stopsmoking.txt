3 days, hopefully this is the final time

Was successful quitting smoking for 4 months starting last december, now I have been off and on again since then.  I want this to be the last time I quit smoking.  Thanks for all the support in this sub.  Going to check in here instead of smoking, and also keep my kwit app updated.

Thanks!

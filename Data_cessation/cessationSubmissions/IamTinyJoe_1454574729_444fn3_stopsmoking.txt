Getting back on the wagon.

I fell off the wagon about 2 months ago. I did not mind, because at the time I had excuse after excuse to justify why I should not worry about it. Most of it is a high stress management position, with shit hours. If I did not go and smoke, I would sit behind my desk the whole day. 

It is getting to the point now, where I actually feel like I want to quit. The chief reason is my weight and lack of energy. I have two girls, The oldest is one, and the youngest is 3 months. I can keep up with the oldest no problem right now, but I can see where I will have problems later. 

Sex is hard, I started having breathing problems again. I can't walk up really long steps with out coughing up a lung, and I really am starting to feel it in my chest. 

I want to be active, but I am always tired. I want to walk and run, but my breathing gets hard. I want to be able to take classes with the girls, when they get older (I will learn to dance if they want too). 

This post, for me, is step one. Admitting that I have a problem. The next step is to set a quit date and stick to it. 

Step three will be to start working out to feel better. 

Step four is keep meal prepping and cooking my own food with the wife and kids. 

Thank you for taking the time to read though this. Have a great day, and remember Si unitas victoria.

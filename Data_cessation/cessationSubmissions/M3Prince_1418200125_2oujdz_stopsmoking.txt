I had my last smoke exactly 1 week ago....

After 25 plus years of smoking, dipping, nicorette, cigars, i made a week cold turkey.  Dont feel too bad.  Been having dreams/nightmares about smoking but no slip ups.  Hasnt been a day since Reagan was president that i havent had nicotene in me so im pretty happy..., right now i think i got the flu or some crap so havent even thought of smokes in past 12 hours.  Suppose to go to a football game in a week and a half and am scared about temptations but ive decided i just wont drink.

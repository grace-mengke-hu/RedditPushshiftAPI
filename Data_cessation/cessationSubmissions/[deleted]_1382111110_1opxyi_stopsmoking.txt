Emotional week and stayed strong

My daughters best friend Jennas father fall out of his tree stand Sunday.  He broke his back, neck and seven ribs and was in ICU for days.

We also found out Sunday that a friend of my sons died in a car accident early Sunday morning.  They are juniors in high school...16 years old.  They didn't get much work done this week at school and Wednesday they had his funeral at the school.

I was really emotionally one day and I actually had the thought go through my head that I may not live that long anyway maybe I should just smoke.  But I know that is just the addict part of me trying to rationalize smoking.  I toughed it out over the emotional days.  It did make me even more sure that I have got this beat for good this time.  No matter what happens in my life I am not going to smoke!!

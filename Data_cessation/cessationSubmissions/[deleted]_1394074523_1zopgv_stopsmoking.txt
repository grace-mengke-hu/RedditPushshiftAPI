So stressed. Not gonna smoke.

For the first time in a month, I just really want to smoke. Not going to, but the urge hit hard. My husband has some kind of personality disorder, I've never met someone so hard to deal with and it never gets easier. That makes me think how nice a cigarette would be. Nasty things. So very glad I quit!

Edit: I had a few jellybeans and distracted myself with reddit and the moment passed....I know there will be more, and I will let those pass as well :) Thanks everyone!

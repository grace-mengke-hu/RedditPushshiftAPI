Today's the day

I woke up a couple hours ago and instead of starting my day with a smoke (morning ritual for the last 8 years) I crushed what was left of my pack.  This isn't the first time I've tried to quit, but this time I'm hoping it's for good.

Begin rant:

I have been smoking since the age of 14.  When I turned 20, I was up to a pack a day.  Now I'm 22, and it needs to stop.

I was a very competitive athlete who played multiple sports.  Was never much of a runner (chalked it up to small lungs) but I had the minimum endurance required to play soccer and football at the university level.  Three weeks ago was the first soccer game I played in a couple years.  Needless to say, I was one of the first people gassing out on the pitch and the feeling was atrocious.  It took forever to catch my breath and lower my heartbeat.  I don't know what a heart attack feels like, but I felt like I was on the brink of one.

For the first time in my life, my body sent me a clear message by refusing to cooperate.  It was scary, and I refuse to feel that way ever again.

Thanks for reading and good luck to all of you.

Restarting - and a few friendly reminders

Dear friends.

Due to several issues - both personal and professional - I fell back into nicotine abuse, and stayed there for a couple of weeks. Now I'm about to dig myself out.

Here's a reminder to all those struggling through the first few weeks;

- remember; never take another puff. No matter what.

- lay off alcohol. Trust me. No matter how easy quitting might be - wait at least 3 weeks.

- nicotine is NOT a demon - just a stupid chemical. So it can't force itself into your system. Therefor - see first bullit above.

- no matter how great control you might think you have after several months or weeks - you don't. You're an addict. So there's only one cure - see first bullit above.

- despite being an addict, remember this; nicotine actually has some of the weakest PHYSICAL signs of rehabilitation, compared to what's usually considered "drugs". So - remember; it's no worse than a cold - you just keep telling yourself that you can "fix it" by smoking. But the smoke's the reason, so it's like bashing your head against a wall to alleviate a headache...

- Smoking does NOT "cure" stress. It just removes the stress it induced by instigating cravings after about 20 minutes. The initial stress is still present, even after smoking.

- The worst part about quitting smoking is really the sub-conscious "reminders" that you need to smoke. Pass through a few of these - about 5 minutes each - and it starts to become easier.

Finally, a little something to consider; one of my friends treated his smoke-stopping as a trip - the dizziness, the weird thought-patterns, the tiredness - instead of being robbed of cigarettes, he really enjoyed his quitting.

Anyone want to share something?

Good job with your quitting!

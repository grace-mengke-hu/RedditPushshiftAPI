So, quitting smoking tomorrow 12/12/16 (it's night here), need your help to stay quit

Hi guys,

I'm male, 35, been smoking since I was 16.5 years old. I do not drink, and I quit smoking up a week ago (no cravings). My biggest fear is that I might start smoking because I might smoke up (not for atleast a couple of months). I can quit smoking up a lot easier than smoking, mostly because it's legal to smoke.  

After months of procrastinating, I've decided to quit smoking. **I would really appreciate anyone periodically PMing me to check up on me and remind me that I have finally actually quit smoking.** I somehow value messages on reddit a lot more than my friends asking me the same thing :) Thanks! 

Also, tips, tricks on withdrawal are welcome. Any others who are thinking of quitting on 12/12 are welcome to join me! :)

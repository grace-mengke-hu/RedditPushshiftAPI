Almost 60 days now and still going strong! Still tough sometimes though...

So, I had exceptionally bad mood swings all the way up until 35-45 days after quitting. Then, it's like the last two weeks were cake! Even had one of those recurring smoking dreams and even in the dream I took 1 puff and coughed.. then thought, "Eww, why the fuck am I doing this!?" First time I have refused one in my subconscious! hooray!

But, here's the thing, this last week I've been having cravings for seemingly no reason! just like.. I had 2 whole weeks of peace and now they are back.

This is normal right? They are by no means bad cravings and just really irritating at this point. But they eventually get less and less right? lol

Thanks in advance!

**tl;dr:** Cravings came back after not having them since day 35/40. This is normal right?

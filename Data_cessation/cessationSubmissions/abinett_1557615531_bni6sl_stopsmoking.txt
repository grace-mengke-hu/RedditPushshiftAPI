Day 44: Drinking for the second time since I quit

I spent the last fifteen minutes writing and editing something that, if I'm honest, made no sense. It concerned my thoughts on how badly I wanted a cigarette. Fortunately I ate half a share bag of milky bar buttons, probably sent my blood sugar through the roof, and now am content without a cigarette.

Point is, even in my slightly drunk frame of reference, cravings pass.

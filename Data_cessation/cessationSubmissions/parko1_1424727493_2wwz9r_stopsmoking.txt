A word of advice

My story is probably similar to many.
I was given a smoke at a school sport day by an older guy and then proceeded to get myself addicted.
Many of my friends smoked and back then (early 80s) the full health effects were not really known.
I finished school and kept smoking, i then completed a trade course but kept smoking, i worked as a tradesman carpenter on sites for the next 10years but kept smoking.
I went into a sales management role around 15 years ago but kept smoking.
I did have some reasonably long term periods of being smoke free over the last 5-8 years but not how i feel now.
I feel now liberated and free.
I guess the motto of the story is that if you start to smoke i day can very quickly turn into 30 years many many thousands of dollars and long term health issues.
I can honestly say that even though its only been just over 5 weeks i feel better than i have for decades.
This site with people in similar predicaments has helped me more than words can say

My method.

Lets say you smoke a pack a day.

Tomorrow you smoke half a pack. It'll be awful but just do it.

The next day you smoke 3 quarters of a pack. 

The next day you smoke a quarter of a pack.

Then half a pack again.

etc etc etc

What happens is when you get to smoke more tomorrow than you did today, today doesn't feel so bad because you know tomorrow is coming. Not only that, but on days where you get to smoke more than you smoked yesterday, it feels like you're smoking a lot because of the slight change in tolerance and cravings.

I hope this made sense.

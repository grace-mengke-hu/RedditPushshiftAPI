Finally made it three weeks! And had a very merry Christmas!!

After over three months of failed attempts, I finally reached the three week mark.  This board has been invaluable to my success, thanks to all for sharing their progress, advice, and stories!

Yesterday (Christmas day) marked three weeks for me, and I was actually kind of nervous about hanging with my two older cousins, who are both smokers.  They are one of the main reasons I felt it was cool to smoke, and I have looked up to them my entire life.  I was ecstatic to find that both of them had also quit smoking, and there we were, kicking it like old times without the presence of cigarettes!!!  It feels so nice to sit around at a family gathering without the anxiety of having to go outside for a smoke, and feeling ashamed for doing so.  I was cool as a cucumber all week, and achieved my goal of quitting before the holiday season :D

Thank you all so so much, it would have been much more difficult without this community.  Without this board, Allen Carr's book, and the stop smoking app I started using, I wouldn't have stood a chance.  Thanks a million!!

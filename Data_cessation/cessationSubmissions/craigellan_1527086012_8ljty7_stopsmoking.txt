Question after six months smoke free

Im six months smoke free after a 15 year pack a day addiction.  Overall feeling a lot better, cravings are still there but they are manageable.  I'm still having trouble with long term exercising and have gotten "smokers flu"/chest cold a couple times, most recently this week.  Any one else experience this? I thought that six months clean, I shouldn't be experiencing "smokers flu" this far into quitting.  And wondering for those who exercise, how long it took to build your wind/endurance back up.  Many thanks!

Quitting Smoking

Hi,

Recently I started smoking (1 month ago), though I have been on and off of it for a while, never addicted until about the month ago. Before then I was a 'social smoker' and could easily drop it whenever. I've made a decision that on Tuesday, once all of my exams, hand ins and such are all finished for the summer, I will be quitting. The issues / temptations that I see coming up will be as many of the others around here have mentioned as well, Summer. Perfect weather, cig is just so fitting. In addition to that, I'm touring Africa this summer and can only imagine that the occasional cigarette on tour would be nice. Another thing I notice is that it's just a nice thing to do whilst walking, light up and stroll about with sunglasses and headphones. I'd like to nip this thing in the bud before it gets too serious, I'm only on ~5 a day now, but I imagine it would escalate quite quickly. Does anyone have any tips?

Cheers

After Waking Up Cravings

Hey everyone. My first reddit post ever I think. Glad to join the community. Now to the point.

I quit drinking almost a month ago. Now I am smoking two packs a day plus vaping. Last night I felt I was at a place to quit so I threw my last four ciggs away and my lighter. This morning I woke up and the craving, as always, to light one up right away was intense. I rushed to the store to get a pack and the lighter. 

These morning cravings are always what get me. What you do first thing in the more has the most impact on the habits of the rest of your day. I quit once for two years by vaping and then even weened off of that but this time I can't seem to make the switch. 

How have you guys managed to overcome the morning cravings? What have you done to get your mind off of it and onto the day ahead or something else? What methods have you tried? Also, on things like break times, in the car after sex, eating, and right before you go to bed? 

I live in my van and chain smoke while in here. I'll even prolong getting out to do the things I need to do, just so I can have that one more. Any help, ideas, thoughts, or suggestions would be really appreciated. My smokers cough is getting bad. I constantly have to clear my throat and my breathing patterns get worse and worse all the time. I want to quit but I just can't seem to get there. I got sober, now I have to breathe better. The breathing part is the sole contributor, I believe, to all of the anxiety I have constantly but I insist on torturing myself.

Please be reasonable guys/gals. I'm having a hard enough time as it is beating myself up. It would be nice to get some support rather than being berated. I'm always open to respectful but bold constructive criticism though.

Be well!

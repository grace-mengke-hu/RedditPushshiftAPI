Ooof pack of rollies found in jacket put on this morning! 9 days and still counting

Bit of rain about this morning here, so put jacket on, hand in pocket, and that familiar shape of box was there.  

Had a bit of a barny with the mrs this morning, which didn't help and as I was leaving the house this was not a good time to find that tobacco.  

Fortunately my 9 days, has seen me feel a lot healthier already (evidenced through real big gains I'm making in my half marathon training already).  Its seen me have more time for the 3 most important people in my life (in spite of the odd barny:). It's seen my save a little money, and start thinking about what I'm going to treat myself to with it. 

Quickly reinforcing these gains and core values I have that quitting is helping me understand more clearly, enabled me to take that full pack and lob it straight in the wheelie bin - and afford a little smile as I carried my son off to the car and on to nursery.  

Really shown me how vigilant I must stay though, and that was the first real challenge of my willpower.  

Made me researcha  bit into willpower, and though I'd share the below article I found, which I quite like.  Have a good day everyone

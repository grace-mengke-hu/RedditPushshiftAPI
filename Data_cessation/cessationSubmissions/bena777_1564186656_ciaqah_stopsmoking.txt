Today is the day.

For about a year now I’ve always had cigarettes when going out, but by January to now it snowballed to 10-15 a day, and for an UK teenager that cost a lot. I want to quit now when it’s financially easy to do so (i.e. I have no money) so when I do have more income i’m not spending it all on cigarettes and fucking up my health. Just wanna let you know (as a new redditor, but frequent visitor of this sub as an anon.) this community is so inspiring. I’m going to try to not have any tonight - and let that be the start of something good. Let’s quit.

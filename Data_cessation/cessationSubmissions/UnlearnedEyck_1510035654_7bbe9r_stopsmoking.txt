Why can’t I quit?

I’ve been smoking for 16 years. I’ve quit before but the longest I’ve ever been able to make it is about a week. I hate the way that it smells and even tastes. I’m not sure why I do it honestly. Supposedly it is because my body is addicted to the nicotine but I’ve tried the gum and since I was getting nicotine with it I should not have wanted a cigarette while I was chewing it right? I know that it takes time but still... I ended up smoking with the gum in my mouth! I have a vape that I just bought but it’s just not the same. I’ve tried different mg of nicotine in it but nothing seems to compare to smoking a real cigarette. I desperately need to quit for all of the obvious reasons but also because it is starting to cause problems in my relationship. I can’t seem to go a full 2 hours without one. Does anyone have any advice or ideas to get me started? I also had asthma when I was little and because of my smoking I’m having to use an inhaler again. Why is this so hard?

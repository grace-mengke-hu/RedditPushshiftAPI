I'm worried that quitting smoking is going to leave me stressed and depressed

So I've been smoking dokha (type of Arabic tobacco) for the last 4 1/2 years, but I think its about time I stopped. I've been thinking about it for a while now, but I had a chat with my mum today and she ended up crying because I'm "killing myself", so that kind gave me the extra push. Thing is, she is a major reason why I feel the urge to smoke a lot of the time because being around her just drains me mentally and emotionally as she is hands down, the most difficult person I know. Also, living under the same roof as her doesn't help.
I'm seriously considering quitting, but am really worried that I''m going to lose my shit because smoking has turned into my coping mechanism when I'm under stress. I don't really know what to do at this point.

I Dream of Smoking.

I had a wild dream, it was so real.  I dreamt I was having a night out with my girlfriend and I went outside to smoke, it was like I forgot I quit.  I chain smoked in my dream, bullshitting with other people outside.  

Then I woke up.  I panicked!  I was like, "OMG DID I SMOKE!?"...I had to sit up in bed and separate my dream from reality before I was sure I in fact did not smoke.  

For that moment though, where I thought I did smoke, horrible disapointment in myself.  Like a punch in the gut.  I was so upset.  Im so happy it was just a dream.  

That experience though, that dream felt so real it was like a glimpse of an alternate reality where I got to feel what it would be like to fail at this....My God I have never not wanted a cigarette more, dream failing at this mission felt awful!

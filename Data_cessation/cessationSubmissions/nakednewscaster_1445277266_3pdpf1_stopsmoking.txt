645 days. If I can do it so can you.

I'd completely forgotten I got a badge here when I quit. I'd been a smoker for about 18 years. I smoked a pack a day. 


When I started smoking I'd never thought of it as something I would do forever, and before quitting I'd started asking myself, "well when am I going to quit? When my doctor says I have to?"



I read Alan Carr's 'Easy Way to Quit Smoking' and followed the instructions to a T. I swear to you, I have not even missed smoking a single time since. It was the easiest thing I've ever done.


You can achieve anything you set your mind to, and for me quitting smoking was one of the easiest things I've done. If I can do it, so can you. I wish you the best of luck.

Week one strategies

Hey guys I’m 26 and have been at a pack a day since 18, I enjoy the occasional aderall and on those days I’m easily at two packs. I’m fit(gym five days a week) but this shit finally feels like it’s caught up to me. I’m miserable when I wake up. I have this high pitched weez all morning until I smoke a few(ironically)

My question for you successful quitters is.. is it better to ween myself off or just stop completely. Tbh weening has failed me a few times over the years, patches/gum replacement have not helped at all. If anything they make me crave the actual thing. Should I just stop buying them? Does recording progress help? I’ve lost my grandpa and Grandma both to lung cancer. My little brother and aunt have had cancer. I feel like I’m tempting fate here, I need help.

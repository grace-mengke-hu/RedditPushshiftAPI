I just smoked my very last cigarette

I actually quit smoking last Sunday. After getting some really horrible, shocking news this morning I had a relapse today and bought a pack. It was a stupid idea and obviously it did not help me in any actual way in dealing with the situation. But anyway, I have decided after the first one that I'll go through the entire damn pack now, one last pack, until my very last cigarette ever. I never smoked so many cigarettes in that amount of time and I almost puked during the last one and my body feels way worse now than during those first days of not smoking. Every single cigarette was just tasting and smelling horrible. 

I thought about it all day just to finally get my mindset really straight on this: they don't give me anything. They don't make me relax, they don't make me more focussed (I was way more distracted today than all week), damn, they don't even get you high. From now on, I'm a non-smoker and I will never touch a cigarette again. I will not avoid any social gatherings and I will not force myself, because I don't have to. I am not giving up on anything, I am freeing myself of it. I'm not sacrificing anything, I'm just gaining without suffering any loss in my life. I'm doing the right thing. I can smoke whenever I want to, but I don't want to anymore, so what's the point in moaning about it? After ten years I can finally say: I AM DONE!

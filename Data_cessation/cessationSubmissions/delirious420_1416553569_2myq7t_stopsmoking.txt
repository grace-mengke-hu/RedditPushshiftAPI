Switching to vaping after only 6 years.

Hey guys. Sorry for the format,I barely post to Reddit. 


Well I'm 18 And have been smoking for 6-7 years. I have tried several ways to quit, But non of them made me quit. 

I know there is still nicotine in the juice I use, But it feels a lot cleaner And I'm not embarrass to show new people I meet. 

It's been 3 days And I'm doing fine. Although It's just an alternative to cigarettes I'm totally fine with that.

I've started to smoke more and more infrequently, but now I'm stopping for good

I started to smoke a year and a half ago, and I've tried to quit since then. My biggest streaks have been 3 months last summer, 1 month in January. During the last few months I've smoked around a pack a week.

Some things I've noticed when my streaks ended:

It's really easy to start again if you've drunk a lot of alcohol, so I should limit it to one glass an evening though even that weakens your discpline significantly.

Caffeine has been a substitute to smoking for me, but those jitters also make want to have a smoke, so I should avoid drinking it to an excess.

Stress caused by failures and self-loathing is probably number one reason for starting again. I've tried to find other ways to deal with stress and reading books or watching movies or tv series might work best.

It's gonna be hard because I have to change my life somewhat but I'm excited to try and confident I'm able to do at least three months and after that it should be easier.

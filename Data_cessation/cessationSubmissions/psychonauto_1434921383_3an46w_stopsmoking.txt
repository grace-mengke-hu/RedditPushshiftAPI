Need advice to help my dad quit.

My dad was a cigarette smoker for about 25 years. He recently got a minor heart attack, and the doctors told him he must stop smoking. This finally pushed him over the edge I guess, and so he tried actually quitting for the very first time (after everyone in his life always telling him to do it). He went without cigarettes for I think about a week or less, and then he felt the withdrawal was too strong and the cravings too intense, so he tried nicotine patches. As far as I know the patches were working well, but he realized he could not afford them because they were too expensive. So now he is trying something new... smoking cigars.

I don't know much about cigars. Are the significantly healthier? Are they a good step towards quitting or does it just make it look like he's trying when it actually doesn't change much?

What should I do next to help him?

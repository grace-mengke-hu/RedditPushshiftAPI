I'm quitting... today.

I've been on and off the wagon so many friggin' times at this point. Last time, I went a full day and then my mom came to visit and I bummed a smoke from her. What has really done it for me this time is that I went running last night for the first time in a year (and it wasn't even really running, it's Couch to 5K, so I ran for approx 6 minutes total), and I felt like I was dying. I've never had that happen before. I have 4 cigs left in my pack. I'm going to smoke them and think about how they taste, and how I have to run again tomorrow. I've read EASYWAY, so I know I can combat it. I would say wish me luck, but I'm guided by a force much greater than luck!

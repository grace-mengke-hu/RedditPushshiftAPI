Just starting out

I've been smoking for a solid year after on and off for 4. But tonight, I've decided to cut the bad habit from my life. I've quit before, but only to please my parents and I had full intentions to start again. This time it's for me and [my kitty.](http://imgur.com/G04g02E) I still have two and a half packs sitting on my dresser, and I would hate to throw money away, but I would be doing the exact same thing if I continued smoking.

I'm afraid of what is going to happen in the next few days, and I am going to need a lot of help. I have three apps to help, but other support, whether it be reddit or my boyfriend or anyone, is needed as well. I can't do this on my own, but that's what is so great about this sub. Here, we can rant and get support.

So here it goes reddit. I'm going to fight the urge in the morning to step outside first thing. That's the big challenge.

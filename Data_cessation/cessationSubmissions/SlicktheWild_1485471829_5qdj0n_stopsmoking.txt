Day 10 on Chantix

So I've smoked a pack or more a day for nearly 6 years. I recently started taking Chantix to kick the habit. My doctor warned me of some wicked side effects, he knows I have the constitution of a bear so we weren't worried. 

Side effects I've had: nausea, dizziness and light headed within twenty minutes of taking each dose. Typically wears off in an hour or less. I've had relatively vivid dreams every night, but no nightmares. A friend said I should tell my doctor because dreaming a lot on Chantix could be a foreshadowing of a psychotic break. Lol 

Otherwise, I smoked my last cigarette about 12 hours ago and it tasted like a burnt turd wrapped in old plastic. Made me completely nauseous and I couldn't even finish it. I guess it's doing the job, because I completely abhor the smell and taste of cigarettes now. Yay!

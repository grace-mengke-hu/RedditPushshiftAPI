Day One

And so it begins! I finished reading Allen Carr's book last night and have smoked my last cigarette. It's been 12 hours. I feel good, I'm just terrified that I'm going to fall back into it. I've been a pack-a-day smoker for a few years now, and most of my friends have laughed when I have told them that I'm quitting because they just don't believe me. I have a couple big challenges this week that are definitely going to test me. Fingers crossed I resist temptation!

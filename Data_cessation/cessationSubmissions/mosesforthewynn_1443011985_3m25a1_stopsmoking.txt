Update: I screwed the pooch...

Well, I fucked up yesterday. I made it to 6 PM then broke down and bought a pack. I think I'm going to ween myself off rather than quit cold turkey. I have set a quit date of 27-09-2015 and am using an app called Smoke Free to help. In the app you can log your cravings and how many times you have smoked. It also gives you missions each day to help you quit.  It also recommends NRTs to help aid in quitting.

I messaged badge-bot and my 1 day badge should be gone shortly.

If anyone has any advice or information that could be helpful, I would appreciate it.

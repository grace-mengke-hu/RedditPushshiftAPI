I was a smoker of 7 years

Now I've quit. I was smoking 1 pack a day for the last 7 years, I am 22 years old now and I wont let it happen for the rest of my life. 

What keeps me going are the cravings, whenever I think about going back I gain strength to keep going, because its really fucked up if you think about it.

18 days, I think i will brag again after my first month, btw thank you for this subreddit, some posts here have helped me in the first days

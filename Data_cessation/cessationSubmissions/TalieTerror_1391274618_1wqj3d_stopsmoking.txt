Just about two months...

Occasionally I miss smoking, sometimes I worry I won't be as social, but over all it's not nearly as bad as I feared it would be. It probably helps that my city has been really cold most of winter. Smoking in a snowstorm wasn't fun. Now I get to sit inside and watch it all. Hopefully the summer isn't too triggering. Still, at this point, I feel good.

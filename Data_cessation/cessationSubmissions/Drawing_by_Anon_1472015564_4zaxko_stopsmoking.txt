40 Days and 40 Nights, just like that Josh Hartnett fellow

Right, I’m feeling a lot better since my last post. Mornings aren’t the struggle they used to be. I still get small cravings here and there but they go away fast. I’m hardly thinking about cigarettes during the day now. I am remembering what it used to be like before I was chained to this drug.


I had a very vivid dream last night where I accepted a smoke from someone, putting an end to my unprecedented progress. “It’s just one.” I was so pissed at myself. Then I woke up, confused at first before I realized it was just a dream. Oh the relief! but it highlights my fear of relapsing in the future. I’ve NEVER made it this far before and I can’t imagine what 6 months or a whole year must feel like as an ex-smoker. Then I read some of the heartbreaking posts on here where fellow redditors who’ve been smokefree for that long or longer slip up. Just hurts - makes me want to hug everyone. At what point are we finally free?


One day at a time onward and upward.

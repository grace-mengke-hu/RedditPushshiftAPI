Are you still a successful quitter if you use an e cig?

I haven't smoked an actual tobacco cigarette since September 30. I used the patches for the first 2 weeks. This last weekend I ended up buying an e cig, because it was cheaper than the patches. I'm curious how you guys feel about this. Is it fair to say that I have quit, or are e cigs just as bad as regular cigarettes?

EDIT: I understand that I'm still nicotine dependent. Nicotine however, isn't really harmful by itself. It's a stimulant that in the worse case can give you stimulant side effects like nausea, HBP etc. Understand that I'm not opposed to taking stimulants. I have the caffeine molecule tatted on my chest to pay homage to the thing that helped me get a college degree. The main benefit of switching is that I'm not filling my lungs with tar(finally clearing my lungs out again sucks), don't smell bad (like smoke anyway), and I'm not spending 5-6 bucks on cigarettes every day. To me it seems like a win-win.

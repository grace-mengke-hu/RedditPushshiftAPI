Question about the vape pen and how it relates to addiction

I quit cold turkey, but a lot of my friends are using the vape pen. I'm not sure if I consider the vape pen quitting, but its certainly better than cigarettes, in terms of the chemicals you're inhaling.

I noticed that their "pens" are all pretty weighty and sort of flashy. There are customizable ones; one of my friends has his name engraved in it.

My question is this: Do vape pens make it harder to quit nicotine if, in your mind, you always remember how much you spent on your vape pen and you miss that weight of it in your hand? I've never seen anyone get clear of nicotine by weaning off with the pen, decreasing the nicotine dosage of their vape juice.

I'm not saying it's never happened, I've just never seen it. They always go back to cigarettes "until they can get to the vape shop" because they, "decreased their dosage too soon." I think that's a crock of shit.

**TL;DR**: Does the price and weight of a vape pen make it more difficult to leave nicotine because they feel its more permanent/reusable than a pack of cigarettes?

Quitting TODAY!

After 3 failed attempts to quit smoking, I decided to give a shot to Allen Carr's book by a friends recommendation.

This time I am convinced that I will not smoke again.
I'm going to start coming to this subreddit asking for some advice on this quest towards the elimination of nicotine dependence.

PS: Quick question, is it true that the first 3 weeks are the hardest?

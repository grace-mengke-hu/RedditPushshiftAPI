4th of July weekend was tougher than I thought it would be

Just like last year, I watched the fireworks on a rooftop overlooking our city skyline. I was with the same 3 people, and one of us was smoking all night, but it wasn't me this time!! I definitely had the urge to, though--a few beers in, watching the fireworks with a lovely breeze in the air, I had that feeling that everything would be just a little bit better with a cigarette in my hand. The [terrifying check I wrote](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1g1lx9/social_smoker_for_18_years_if_i_smoke_again_focus/) helped me rationalize my way through the craving, and it passed as they always do. Then on Sunday, I went to a BBQ with another chain-smoking friend and stayed smoke-free there, as well. I didn't feel the urge to smoke at all.

Being an ex-smoker is getting easier each day. I know it will never be a walk in the park, but every time I would normally smoke and I don't, I feel a little more confident.

My next challenge: a relaxing long weekend getaway with my partner. I know I can do it!

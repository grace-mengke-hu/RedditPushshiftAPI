Accidentally Quit; Question about the Patch

I started taking Wellbutrin after a long break and realized about six hours after I took the first pill that I and the smoked at all. Went to have one and it was gross. I fought my way through the grossness until I finished the pack I had, and now it’s been 24 hours since I had a cigarette. Mornings are absolutely the worst for me when I’m trying not to smoke, so I git some patches and put one on this morning when I got up. 

So now we are at the whole point of this rambling post—how tough are these patches?  Can I go for a run with one on? Also, does it have to be on my upper body? Any reason I shouldn’t put it on my hip?

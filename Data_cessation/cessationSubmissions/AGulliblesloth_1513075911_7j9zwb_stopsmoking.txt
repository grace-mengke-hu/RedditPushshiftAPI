Itching when quitting?

So I decided to quit smoking a couple weeks ago, and have broken out in little bumps that itch like crazy on my hands and stomach. They look like hives, and I can't help but guess they are a withdrawal symptom. Has anybody else gone through this and have any advice, or know when they will clear up? Any help is appreciated.

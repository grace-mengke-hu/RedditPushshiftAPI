A substitute for quiet, alone time

Hey everyone. I'm not a (frequent) smoker, but my boyfriend is and he's in the preparation stages to start quitting again. I'm trying to help him work out a plan, because what has happened in the past when he tries to quit is he'll be doing well, cigarette-free for up to a month, then he'll run out of nicotine patches or something bad will happen and he slowly starts smoking again until he's back up to his normal amount. What we're trying to do this time around is come up with different scenarios and how he's going to cope with them without cigarettes, rather than figuring it out as he goes.

So my question is this. He's very introverted and anxious and one of the appeals of smoking for him is the chance to take a few minutes out of his day to not have to deal with anyone. For those of you who are in the process of quitting or have quit, what do you replace that alone time with? Is there a way to do the smoke break, minus the smoke? Thanks in advance!

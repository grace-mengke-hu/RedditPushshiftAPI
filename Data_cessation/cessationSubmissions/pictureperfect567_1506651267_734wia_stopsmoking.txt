How to not get into smoking?

***If you don’t feel like reading the long story about how I got to where I am then just read the last paragraph! Thank you!! 

I know this page is for people who are already addicted? I’m not sure. Anyway I’m not addicted, at least I don’t think I am. I’m 21 and moved to Colorado a few weeks after my 21st birthday and obviously I had to hit the dispensaries bruh lol (that was a joke). But yeah I smoked weed before but it was more socially and it was always so hard to get where I lived so it was a once every 2 weeks kinda thing or once a week but when I moved to CO I could get it literally any time! 
So I was super bored didn’t know a soul and had nothing to do so i started smoking weed everyday then I started going out to clubs to meet people my age and stuff and in my dumb head the easiest way to talk to people was to ask for a cigarette. I’d go over to people smoking and ask for a cigarette then make conversation and it was good but then I realized that smoking makes you feel more drunk so you don’t have to spend too much on drinks so then I started to actually like the smoking but only when I was drunk and I told myself I’d never buy cigarettes I’d only ask people and that lasted about 3 months so then yesterday I was high and I wanted a kick so I went out and bought my first pack of cigarettes and then instantly started to freak out about how I’m a smoker now. 

I know this was really look but basically all I want to know is how to stop myself from getting into it in the first place?

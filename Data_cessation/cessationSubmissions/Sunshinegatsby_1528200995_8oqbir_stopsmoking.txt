Just over 24 hrs, I’m amazed at the tricks my mind keeps playing on me.

This is about the 5th time I’ve quit and so far, it’s the easiest I’ve found it (definitely the easiest first 24hrs). 

I was just thinking to myself how easy I’ve found it and thought “well if it’s been this easy maybe I could just be a social/casual smoker after all” 

I’m now on guard against my own brain from trying to trick me into smoking, when I really don’t want to.

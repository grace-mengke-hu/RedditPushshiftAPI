I abstained from smoking for four days. I am schizophrenic and just lapsed...

I was able to abstain from smoking for four days. Being that I am sick it was difficult to do. I wouldn't say it was the hardest thing I have been through but it was pretty difficult. Struggling with this illness is very difficult.

I acknowledge that I shouldn't resume smoking just because I only had one. My life is incredibly difficult and stressful. Everyday is a different day, some days I feel as though I am in remission and have completely recovered... Some days it feels like I am living in hell... Today was a day that I felt like I was living in hell.

Part of my disease, or me coping with it is always trying to find an answer of how I will be or function far down the line. My mind creates realities that I may live in in the future. I get stressed during my bad days that I may ultimately be institutionalized, on my good days I feel like I can do anything that I want.

 I become afraid that I am starting to get disorganized... Some days I can think flawlessly, other days I have a very difficult time thinking, and when I can't think well I get stressed. Today was a day where I couldn't think well... 


The first couple of days of me abstaining I did plenty more things then usual. I was more adventurous and realized I had to do more things with my day in order to keep my mind away from thinking I should pick up a cigarette. 


I need all the help I can get. My mind plays tricks on me a lot, sometimes too much. I wouldn't say I have let myself down because I still have an opportunity to abstain and quit again. Quitting is difficult for everyone, in fact it may be the most difficult thing anyone can do and expecting it to be easy will ultimately bring you down.

If everyday I had was the same and if I didn't have my up and downs I would say quitting would be relatively easy comparing to living with this mental illness.

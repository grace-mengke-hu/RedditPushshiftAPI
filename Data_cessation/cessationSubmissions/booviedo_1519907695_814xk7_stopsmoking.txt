I smoked after 9 days.

I started to have very terrifying heart palpitations that would not stop during the day 8. I already have an anxiety disorder so I could not take it. I smoked two and a half cigarettes within the day 9, thinking it would make the heart palpitations stop, it did not. I felt disgusted. And I am smoke free again for 2 days. Is high heart rate normal during quitting? Do you think I should reset my quit time counter?

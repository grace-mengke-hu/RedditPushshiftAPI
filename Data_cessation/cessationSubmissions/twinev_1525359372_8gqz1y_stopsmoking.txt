How do you reward yourself for your success?

I've found that celebrating my success with periodic rewards is a great and uplifting way to pat myself on the back. For me, after 15 years of smoking, quitting has been the hardest thing I've ever done. So after 6 months free, I bought myself a nice pair of high quality Sennheiser headphones. After a year, I splurged on an exotic vacation. I'd love to hear your ideas! How do you reward yourself for your successes?

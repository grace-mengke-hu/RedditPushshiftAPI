Advice for smoker of 5 years on handling anxiety and cold, nervous, sweating while quitting?

I've smoked for 5 years, give or take, with only a couple of periods where I quit for no longer than a couple of months at a time.  I've hit a point in my life where I have realized how much I need to quit, for myself and everyone around me.  I'm three days in, and I've not been hardly able to sleep because one of the specific reactions I have is cold sweats, almost constantly, and before long, my sheets, pillow, and bed are soaked in sweat.  Any recommendations?  I'm really trying to make this one the one, and it is important to me to not play around with other forms of nicotine, but just quit.

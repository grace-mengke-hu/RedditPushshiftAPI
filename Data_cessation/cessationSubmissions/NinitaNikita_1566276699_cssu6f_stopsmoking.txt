1 month, huge party and no urge to smoke! :)

1 month, yeah! So happy, so convinced this time. I have severe problems since I quit with my lungs, digestion, sleep... but I am still happy to be free. Even had a company party this weekend with a lot of alcohol and half the night through: no craving! Didn't want to smoke! I am really glad about this. :)

Set my quit date. Been smoking 16 Years.

Going to quit smoking next weekend. The 25th of May will be my last day. 

I have a three day weekend to give me time to detox and not relapse during work. 

Last week, I was chain-smoking and felt extremely weak. I've been trying to weight train with limited results and I've been lying to myself for years thinking I "need" smoking for whatever situation my life is going through at the time. 

Fuck that shit. I used to weigh 360lbs and I'm 190, I quit biting my nails and drinking soda. Why am I letting cigarettes win?

I set my quit date because of the physiological and psychological effects I have to tackle and due to my work schedule, I won't get another 3 day weekend until September, and fuck that. 

There is no try, there is just do.

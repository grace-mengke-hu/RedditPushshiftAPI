Hello and help

First time poster. I am into day 3 of being smoke free, and I feel good about it for the most part. My problem is that I get into my own head; my wife works weekends and I'm usually left to coral 3 young boys in bed, by that time I'm so stressed I need a smoke. In the past when I've tried quitting I buy a pack Friday afternoon as a "just in case" but knowing full well I'll have a few to get me by. Any tips or words of encouragement to help get past this mindset are greatly appreciated, and looking forward to being a part of the reddit community!

Dealing with return of sense of smell.

So, on day 4 of quitting, almost to the minute, my sense of smell came back.  It was like someone flipped a switch - bam, I can smell things again.  Great, right?  Sense of smell is great, right?  

It's freaking me out.  Apparently, I use a bath product whose smell drives me nuts.  I'm not sure which one it is, but, I suspect it's my shampoo.  Why did I never notice how horrible this smells before?  Okay, it doesn't smell *horrible,* but, I really don't like the smell of it.  

I feel like a blood hound on meth.  I smell everything now.  Even before I smoked, I was always sensitive to smell.  Now, I feel like I have some sort of weird super power.  

Okay, I'm rambling, but, I guess the tldr of my question is:  how do you deal with the emotional aspects of the return of your sense of smell?

I'm 19 been smoking since I was 13.... Today it ends!

I'm going to stop smoking for good today. Its a waste of money and I just hate how I have to depend on them now. 

I can't even go to school without having a cigarette and that fucking wrecks me. But today I will refuse to smoke and continue to do so.

This is going to be very hard so please give me advice and help me through this. Thank you and wish me luck!

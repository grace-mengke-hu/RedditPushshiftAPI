My first attempt at quitting - I hope to be also the last one

**Background:**

* ***Age***: 23 y.o
* ***Cigarettes/day***: 20 
* ***Smoking period***: August 2013 - October 2014 (1 year and 2 months)
* ***Previous attempts at quitting***: none. This is the first and last attempt.
* ***Trigger***: lack of money made me realize that I was spending 20% of my income to maintain an illusion and to weaken my immune system.

**Useful resources:** 

* Allen Car - The Easy Way to Stop Smoking (Audio-book)

**Mindset**:

After listening to Allen Car in the past 6 hours I've become disgusted only by the thought of smoking. On my last smoke I took the cigarette and smelled it. I wanted to feel the tobacco making me sick. I've lighted it knowing and accepting that his will be my last one, that I have no reason to envy my smoker friends, that my coffee will feel lonely each morning from now on etc.

Prior listening to this audio-book I perceived smoking as a habit & pleasure. I thought that I will quit something that makes me feel better. It didn't take much to realize that I don't have anything to lose, but only to win beautiful things. 

Each cigarette demanded another cigarette. The longer the time passed between cigarettes, the longer the *pleasure*.Whenever I felt down, stressed, happy, excited -- I had to smoke either to celebrate the happiness or to calm the fuck down. But it wasn't the smoking that was calming me down. In fact, it flipped my default state of being from calm to stressed.

**What kept me an addict:**

* addiction to nicotine: nicotine's half life is 1-2h, but usually after 30 minutes I felt a light need to smoke. After 1h a mild need, and after 2h I used to be in overdrive.
* brainwashing: smoking is social. smoking looks badass. 

**Threats to my future healthy days:** 

* smoker friends
* parties/going out
* walks to subway/shop/etc. 
* morning/lunch/night/all rituals

**How I'll tackle the temptations/threats**

I'll treat them as a game. The Boss who I have to kill is called *Nicotine*. If I want to kill it not only I have to refuse any temptation, but to feel happy about it too. So whenever I resist, I'll get a boost in confidence and The Boss will lower it's pressure on me. The Boss will tackle very hard in the first 5 days and will eventually give up on the 21st day. It is my duty to not become complacent after day 21. I'm aware that those that are able to quit with low effort, are also vulnerable to smoking again in no time because they feel in control. They know now that they can quit anytime. But they're living an illusion and I know better than that.

I just felt like posting this here to see how my badge will change day by day.

I just spent 45 minutes in front of a 7-11

I was this close to getting a pack. I'm on day 6. I ended up getting a chocolate milk, a cookie and two slices of old pizza.

I felt like a fatass and hated myself, kept trying to give myself a reason to buy a pack.

I made it home and I feel a bit better. 

Day 6 down.

Everything is changing

"Woosah".... I need to go meditate or do yoga or some fucking thing to keep me from prison.  Lord help me but this non smoking life has unleashed a beast.  I'm not really like snippy from nicotine withdrawal.  More like now that I know I can shake the longest,  heaviest monkey I've ever had from my back, now I feel like I can do anything. 

Life is too damn short and I'm past giving any fucks for people who are not moving in a similar forward motion nor those who feel like giant anvils around my ankles.  Sadly this includes my husband and I truly am beginning to feel like we are rounding the last corner before we reach the end.  At some point my own happiness and need for mental clarity has to outweigh the fact that parts of me do love parts of him.  As a whole though this Shit has always been a mismatched puzzle that we worked hard to match the pieces in. 

I feel like I want to change every single thing in my life.  Maybe this is like a midlife crisis,  but all I can think is that my choices up to this point have not made me happy.  Now I want to be happy.  I want to live almost completely opposite to how I have been, and I want to see how that works out for me. 

I had no idea how much this journey was going to change everything in my life.

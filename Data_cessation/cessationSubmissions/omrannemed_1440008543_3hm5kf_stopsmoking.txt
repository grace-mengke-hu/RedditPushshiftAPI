2 fucking weeks !!

i don't know how the badge system works , but iam glad as hell iam free for 14 days , it wasn't easy for me , someone who hasn't achieved anything before , and with the anxiety , stress , and overthinking it was fucking brutal , i quit cold turkey , the craving are driving me crazy but the main reason i quit and being in good health for two weeks is this sub , reading your stories are giving me hope and confidence , thank you all :)
Ps : english isn't my first language , sorry

So, I don't seem to be coughing up much phlegm/buildup from all the years smoking. Anyone else experience this?

It's been 25 days, I get a bit of mucus once in a while but, it's very uncommon that I get a cough and hork it up. Usually only after heavy physical exercise, even then it's rare. I smoked for 8 years and figure there would be a bunch of gross black gunk being tossed up. It happened early on but it was more of an occurrence when I smoked.

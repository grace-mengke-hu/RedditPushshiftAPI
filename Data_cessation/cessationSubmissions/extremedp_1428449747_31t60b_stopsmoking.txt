Tonight's the night. (Queue Dexter Theme)

Hey Guys,

Back at it. After two years back to smoking after quitting for a year I'm going back at it tonight. Told the SO who I've been hiding it from so I can start fixing all the problems my lying has caused between us. About to finish Alan Carr's Easyway. Support is appreciated. How are you all feeling since quitting?

My mom has smoked for 38 years now, how do I help her?

I don't know if this type of post is allowed. I came across this in a /r/self post, and want advice to help support and stop my mom. I'm only 15, but she's 52 and has smoked since she was 13/14. Her habits are a virulent plague that consumed her, and what she used to be, entirely. She told me a story of how she slipped out of the hospital a few hours after I was born to have a cigarette. She used to be a "DeadHead", touring with the Grateful Dead, but now she can't even go outside because she's not confident and has to smoke frequently.

She's been as low as three a day, but is back to around one and a half packs a day. I don't know where else to turn, as my father and I have tried supporting her but she doesn't seem to have the will. She's unhealthy as it is, smoking is making her worse. I've thought in depth about her health and made pleas to her. The way she's going, she could be dead in 5 years or "lucky" like my grandmother and survive into her 80s. 

Her habits cause feuds in my house, as my parents are stressed about money as it is. Her $10/day habit is only lessening the amount of money for bills we have, and we're month-to-month as it is. The money struggles cause my parents to take their stress out on me, and it's a really unhealthy environment for me to be growing up in.

I'm aware it's an addiction and that it's extremely hard to stop, but she has to realize deep down that it's awful. Is there a way to show her the light? On the bright side, her addiction has lead to me being opposed to cigarettes. I have a few friends that smoke, and they've offered for me to smoke, in which my response is a "no, I value my life and money" (no offense to anyone who does smoke). 

TLDR; Mother has smoked for 38 years, smoking causes family problems, how can I help?

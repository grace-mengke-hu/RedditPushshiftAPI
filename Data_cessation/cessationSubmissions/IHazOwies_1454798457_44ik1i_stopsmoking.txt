"just one..."

It's been almost 4 days since my last cig, this is all I can ever hear.
And just now, the S.O decides it is a good day to have "a talk". You, know *that* talk about the future etc. Fuck, I'm already having a shitty time. I also have fibromyalgia. God damn. I bet quitting is a fuckload easier when you're in a good place..

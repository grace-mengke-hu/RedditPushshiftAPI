Champions: How long until you could say "I am quit?"

How long did it take you to really look at where you were and say "I think I'm done. I'm officially quit. I'm never going back."

I assume it's different for all people, but I've had spans of sometimes months where I wouldn't smoke a cigarette, and thought I was done, and then welllll....

You know how it goes.

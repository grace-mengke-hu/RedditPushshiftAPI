Day two: Coffee and two kinds of crackers:)

Made it through yesterday with a couple of real close calls. Even had a cig in my hand at one time, but didn't light it up. The sipping on a glass of water thing is really helping me fight the urge. Strange, but it works so far:) I am in the middle of day two with no nicotine at all, no ecigs, no meds (doing this completely cold turkey) and still at it.  
My hubby is quitting with me, cold turkey also. It is really helping us to do this together. We are also making sure that we remember we are not mad at each other, we are mad at the nicotine.  
We are gonna make this another good day!

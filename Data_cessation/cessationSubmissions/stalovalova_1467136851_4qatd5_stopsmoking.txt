After five months... I don't even remember what it's like to crave a cigarette

I'm 27 years old and I had been smoking pack a day for almost seven years. Trust me, it gets better. Just make that first step and please don't cave. I don't mean to brag, I just want you to know that fighting through those first couple of days is totally worth it

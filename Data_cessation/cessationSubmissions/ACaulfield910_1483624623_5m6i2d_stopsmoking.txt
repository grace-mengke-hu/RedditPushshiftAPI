Cold turkey for just above a week, proud but I really want a cig

The first 3 days weren't all that difficult, cravings-wise, but I was on an incredibly short fuse, barely got sleep (insomnia?), and was feeling slightly depressed. Funnily enough, everytime I'd get a craving I'd just wait it out for 10 minutes and it'd go away. But today, day 8, I *dreamt* about cigarettes, and I woke up with the most intense craving for cigarettes I've had since I had my last. I waited it out, but I still really want one. The only thing that's holding me is that I know I'm saying "just one" but that one will become two, then three, then a regular thing, which is how I got dragged into smoking in the first place not too long ago.

But for some reason today, it feels like everything reminds me of cigarettes. I smell a cigarette burning from a mile away (exaggeration for obvious reasons). I watch TV and all I notice is the cigarettes. I listen to music and all I think about is how this band member smokes. I read a book, and loandbehold the protagonist is a smoker.

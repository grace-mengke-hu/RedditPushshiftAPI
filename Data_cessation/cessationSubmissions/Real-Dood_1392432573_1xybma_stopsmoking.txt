27 days in with no smoking...

Hi all fellow redditors. It's been almost a full month for me. It's been tough at times but I've been hanging in there. I think I'm past the nicotine addiction part but I still get the urge to go out and have a smoke. I haven't caved in yet. I'm curious for people who have quit longer than me when does the habit part of it go away for you ? Also after a month what sort of health improvements have you noticed ?

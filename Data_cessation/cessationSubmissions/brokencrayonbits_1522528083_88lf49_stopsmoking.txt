Day 1...

I've smoked on and off for the better part of a decade. I quit through all my pregnancies and when I was breastfeeding but then started right back up again each time, as a light smoker, smoking 2-4 cigarettes/day. Now my youngest is 3.5 so I very gradually started smoking more than I ever did, about 4-6 cigarettes a day. I could see this was only going to get worse. Also, I'm a long distance runner. I ran a half marathon last summer. Felt like I was going to die after and I was only smoking 2 a day then. I'm a single mom with young kids, they *need* me to be there for them. I kept making excuses for myself, my life is so stressful, I'm single mom, a full time student, things are hard right now. Nope. Things are always going to be hard. So I signed myself up for a 15 k run on April 21 and set my quit date for today. I totally lost my cool at the kids over nothing earlier so I'm trying to be chill. Can you folks send me some encouragement? I really want to be done smoking forever. Today's been tough.

Mind has started to calm down

For the first time since my teen years 25 years ago my mind has really started to calm down, and it feels absolutly wonderful. I quit 6 months ago and relapsed on new years day but jumped right back up and I have had so many positive changes lately. 

My weight has gone down significantly, I have cut down drinking to half a bottle of wine every other week and IÂ´m active almost every day with hiking, biking, weight lifting or swimming. I havent felt this good for 20 years. 

No more smoking!

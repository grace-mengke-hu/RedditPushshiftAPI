I'm quitting right now.

I'm not going to tell a long story about how I decided this. I'm not going to provide you all sorts of claims on why I am going to quit. I'm just going to do it. I feel like shit all the time, my lungs actually hurt. I cough up dark green/brown shit every single morning in the shower and i'm SICK of it. I used to be athletic and now I breath heavy after walking up steps. Fuck this shit. I read Alan Carr's book months ago, I worked on the mental framework while smoking... and I continued smoking. Fuck me, right? I'm going to put it into use though. I am grateful for that much at least.

Are clove cigarettes a good way to stop smoking normal cigarettes? Are cigars?

My boyfriend is trying to quit but wants to use these as a substitution. I believe him when he says they're healthier (cigars because you don't inhale and cloves because they contain less tobacco) but I worry they feed the addiction and keep you jonesing until the day you slip and reach for the nearest cigarette. Do they help you quit?

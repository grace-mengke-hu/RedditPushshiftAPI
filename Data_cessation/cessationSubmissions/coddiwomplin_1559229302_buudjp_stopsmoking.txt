Unconscious motivation

I recently quit smoking, and somehow it's been different because it was my choice and not pressures from other places. I just thought I'd share a little dream I had that really stuck with me. 

I had a very vivid dream that each cigarette I smoked was pulling health points away from my future. It was totally Mortal Kombat style with the health bar and everything. I started feeling a cancerous lump in my throat and knew it was the cigarettes and I immediately regretted each one. 

That morning I woke up and realized I can never get those health points back.

Good luck and one minute at a time! You're just as far in as you'll ever be out!

My almost one year experience and how it was different from previous attempts.

This quit was different for me in many ways.

1. I tell people how I stopped smoking and feel better and confident as a result.

2. I stopped other intoxicants too as I wasn't finding them enjoyable anymore and I know they used to make me smoke more. I speak out about this too whenever I find a chance.

3. Every time I look at smokers or other addicts, I think about how they have deeper issues and are using drugs to escape. I'm not judging here but this just reminds me of why I used to smoke before. I still have issues to deal with but I'm not resorting to easy ways to escape.

4. I remind myself of people who hate me and would want me to relapse. I don't want to give them that chance. I cut off so-called friends who try to make me slip or just acknowledge how miserable they must be in order to want me relapse. I believe this is one of the most important things a person in recovery should do in the early days - not care about cutting friendships and being selfish. If they truly want you to be happy, they would understand.

5. Focus on other things that make me happy like travel, working out, girls.

6. Acknowledge that I don't always have to be happy and temporary sadness is okay. This is the biggest change I saw after therapy.

7. Think about regret. I'm not saying regret now. But just imagine how much you will regret if you are diagnosed with cancer or something and there's no going back. Would that be worth it?

8. Once you quit, constantly remind yourself of NOPE and a relapse is only going to make your current problems worse.

I hope this helps you all in becoming your best self and believe me when I say quitting smoking and active recovery has a huge multiplier effect on all aspects of your life.

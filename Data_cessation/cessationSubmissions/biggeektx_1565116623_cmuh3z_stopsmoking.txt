Long time lurker here. I’ve been thinking of quitting for some time now but it never seems the right time.

 I know there is no “right” time in actuality but I have some questions. 

How do you identify all your triggers?
How do you handle the ones unavoidable?
And last.. work and coworkers are one of my identified triggers. In your experience is it better to quit on a Friday when you have two days of rest to “cleanse” and withdraw or better to face the trigger head on the first day and quit midweek or beginning of the week?

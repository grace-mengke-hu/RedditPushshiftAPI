Been a month since I quit. Feels unremarkably normal

I can climb stairs without a hitch now so thats neat. But other than that I dont really feel different. It sucks that I cant start and end my day with a smoke. And all my friends are smokers so shit is painful. But its not difficult. I had to quit coz my doc said tobacco was exacerbating my stomach problems so yeah. It wasnt something I wanted to do, but it has made quitting much easier.

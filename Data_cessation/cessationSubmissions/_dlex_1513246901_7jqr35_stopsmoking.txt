Multiple attempts and maybe a new one soon

I'm 34 now and have being smoking since 13 yo, became really addicted (non occasional smoker) when I was 19. I've tried to stop smoking at least 3 times, never got through the 3rd day.

I have mapped my habit very well, I know precisely when I smoke and why I smoke.

I see the cigarette as a friend or something that accompanies me all the time, I feel like loosing someone when I think about quitting. Like if I would be alone.

There's also the being afraid of failing, that always come to my mind the question: "what if I give up? What If I fail again?"

Never asked for help, I'm too shy and proud for, my wife keeps telling me she wants to help me but I understand this is a problem I created myself and I should be responsible to get rid of it - I don't want anybody telling me how I should do it.

I like sports a lot, I play soccer and whatever I can do to move and compete, never had much trouble with the relation smoking and exercise, but I know if I quit I would perform way much better.

Every time I read about quitting I see people telling many different tips and every time I read it I think "bullshit, it will never work" or "I don't need to do that" (but I never do something else), I know these people are very honest and they are trying to be supportive - maybe I'm too arrogant to try.

The key reasons to stop smoking I have listed so far are:
+ have more time to what really matters;
+ save money - now and in the future case I need medical assistance;
+ better fisical performance on sports;
+ better smell;
+ not feel a loser by depending on a cigarret;

Hope it works this time.

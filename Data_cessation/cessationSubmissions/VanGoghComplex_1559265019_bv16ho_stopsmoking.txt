1 month an 18 days quit - been off NRT for five days

I haven't thought for years that I'd make it this far.

I know that I'm not in the clear. I am feeling better, physically and mentally, but I know that I'm one depressive episode away from serious risk.

I've had little blips - times when I've thought about bumming a smoke or buying a pack - and then I look at the app and look at the time I've racked up, the days of success. That's enough to keep me going on.

Don't give up. Aim for the high score. That's what I'm doing.

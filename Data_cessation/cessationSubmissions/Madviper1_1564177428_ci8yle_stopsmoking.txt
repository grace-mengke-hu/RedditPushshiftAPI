Coding and Quitting Smoking

Just wondering if programmers on here successfully quit smoking. I quit about a month ago. I'd been smoking about 15 years and coding is one of those things I just couldn't imagine doing without a cigarette. I still can't bring myself to code as it triggers too many cravings and I feel like I can't really code anymore now that I quit smoking. Anyone?

If i cant quit smoking... I'm not in control

As a supervisor at my job and a "supervisor" of my own life and family, if I want to quit, I should be able to. How I can I tell people how to be if I cant control myself? I have to quit to prove to myself that I am the master of my own domain. I know it sounds real selfish and self serving.... but isn't that the point?   For me, a smoker of 22 years, I think if I can quit I be better then everyone else and tell them how much they suck! JK that's how some people think. Nevermind idk what I'm saying. I'm drunk right now but the good news is I'm not smoking while drunk lol. I have kids, I don't want them them to grow with smoking parents like I did.  Maybe it is selfish in way? Because I don't want my offspring to be addicted? its selfish and not at the same time idk.  I wont lie I admit I am kind of a controlling person but how can you be controlling if you cant even control your own addiction to bitch ass nicotene?

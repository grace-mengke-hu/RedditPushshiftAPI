Protein > Cigarettes

I was drinking pretty heavily last night, and it was about time for my friends and I to walk home. I quit smoking and started working out about a month and a half ago. Instead of craving cigarettes while I was drunk, I stumbled into a walgreens and bought a protein bar to make sure I hit my macros for the day. My friends told me about it the next morning and I was extremely happy with myself.

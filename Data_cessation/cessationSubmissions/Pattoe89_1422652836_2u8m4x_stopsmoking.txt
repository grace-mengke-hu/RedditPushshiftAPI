If you can stop smoking, you can do anything!

That girl you like but haven't plucked up the courage to talk to?

That education you want to get?

That job you want to apply for?

All that exercising you wanna do?

Music instrument you want to play?

Think about it, if you stop smoking you can do anything you want to, think about how much better you will feel about yourself, the confidence you will have.

Me, myself, I'm going to America to hold my long distance love in my arms. I've been with her for 3 years and the cost of smoking has kept me away from her.

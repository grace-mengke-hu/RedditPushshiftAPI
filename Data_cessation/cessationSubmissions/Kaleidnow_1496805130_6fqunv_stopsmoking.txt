It's great to be quit

I have been trying to quit for a while (5 years on and off). This attempt feels good, like my last one. Last time I made it to 1 month and 5 days, a record.

I started smoking after that, one drunken day.

Now, I am not touching alcohol so that my willpower can be as strong as possible!

Once past the 2 week stage it is actually easy. Not many cravings or desire to smoke.

I use lot of mindfulness. When a craving comes I let it pass through me, knowing that it won't last. I would acknowledge agitation as a side effect of quitting and would try not to act upon it.

It has been 20 days already? When did that happen?

Had some struggles, not to mention a crazy-bitch-rage-fit in the first few days. (Love my partners & friends for their support/patience!)

I know I'm not out of the woods yet, but I do feel like life has been going on just fine. I feel better... physically, mentally, emotionally.

I feel like I'm still wrapping my mind around not smoking. Being a non smoker isn't as scary & terrible as I once thought it might be. Sometimes I have to cope, but mostly I am just relieved.

Thanks for the support & your posts, too! It really has helped me to be a part of this subreddit.

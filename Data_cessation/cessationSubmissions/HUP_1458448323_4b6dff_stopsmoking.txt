7 months w/o using vap as substitute

Almost on a milestone, x/22 is my quit date. Actually 8/22/2015, but I like mark each month still. Haven't had even a puff of an analog cig. Down to 6mg vap liquid and today no nicotine at all.  I can't say I'm a success but I feel better and it can be done. 26 year smoker (mostly pack / day).  Keep it up.

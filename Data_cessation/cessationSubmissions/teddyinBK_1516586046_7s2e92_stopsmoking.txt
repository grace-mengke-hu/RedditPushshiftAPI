Relearning how to be at a party

Last night, I was at my boyfriend's friend's birthday party. He lives in a really gorgeous loft in Brooklyn, which means there are no walls, no different rooms, everything and everyone is just...there, out in the open. 

I didn't realize how difficult it would be for me after 3 plus weeks without a cigarette. I bet most of the people at the party assumed I was snorting coke every half hour since I went to the bathroom so often, just to get away. I hadn't realized until last night how much my smoking habit was a vessel for alone time/escape. I genuinely don't understand how people stay in one place for longer than a half hour. Anyone else having this problem??

Arite guys. After my first attempt I lasted 10 days. Today I start again. I'm not a smoker.

Heard some bad news whilst drunk out of my mind last week. My first thought was to go buy a pack of smokes, which I did and smoked 2 and then gave them away.

 I lasted 10 days..

I havent bought a pack since then but after that I have been smoking, bumming of friends etc.

I am done with this and I will die trying. I don't believe in "failing to quit smoking"

I was very confident, ambitious and motivated during my first attempt, I am even more of each now.

And yes, I've already read the /r/stopsmoking bible :P

Post quitting blues

Day 22. I have smoked for 14 years and this is probably the longest I have gone . But depression is hitting me hard. Feeling overwhelmed by all the things I need to do in near future . Feel like shutting myself in a room and crying . Was even thinking about suicide, but my family needs me . A father has to provide-everything, not just money.
Help ! Is this the addiction or is this something else ?

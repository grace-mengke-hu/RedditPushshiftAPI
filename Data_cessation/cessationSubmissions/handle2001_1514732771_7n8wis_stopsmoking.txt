4 Weeks: This is doable.

I smoked one to two packs a day every day from the time I was 15 until December 3rd, 2017, with a break of about a year and a half in 2007. Today marks four weeks since I last had a cigarette. I feel great. I don't miss it at all. The trick for me was finding something else to do, as I realized most of the time I smoked it was because I was bored or hungry or both. I love cooking, and being able to taste food and wine again is amazing. I am working on getting back into shape, I've lost 7 pounds this month and I feel amazing already. I was worried about how I would deal with stress at work and home, but I've found that smoking actually made my stress worse from worrying about when I'd be able to smoke to get rid of the underlying stress, which all just stressed me out more.

The one thing I would like to pass on to people wanting to quit or trying to quit is to spend some time really thinking about what your life will be like without cigarettes. This was the hardest part for me. If you're like me and smoked about once an hour for the 16 or so waking hours of the day, that's 80 to 160 minutes a day you can spend doing something else. So figure out something else you'd rather do, and just do that instead! Stay busy! It's the easiest way to overcome the cravings and dissipate the psychological aspect of the habit. Of course quitting will never be "easy", but it's so very much worth doing.

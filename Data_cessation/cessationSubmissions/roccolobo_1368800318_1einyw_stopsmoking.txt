Almost one month clean! But...

i'm feeling "cloudy". Even though I stand up early, have slept enough before and participate in sports, it's almost as if I was in Autopilot mode. 

Normally cigs where like a setback. Now there is nothing and the ability to clear my mind seems to suffer. In a similar note I think that I'm pretty un-motivated. I am running, I am doing the things I did when I smoked, but I'm not enthusiastic about it. In fact I do not feel very much at all.

Is this normal? Is it because my brain adjusted to the nicotine so much, that there is no other indicator of success besides nicotine? I feel sad about that fact to be honest and I hope it will change... 

Of course I'll stay strong, nobody said it would be easy! Things will change for the better and I'll work on it!

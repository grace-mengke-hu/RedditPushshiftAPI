Day 9

Just a small update.  I've been cold-turkey for the past 9 days, and while the initial, horrible shittiness predictably peaked and fell dramatically on days 3 and 4, I've had this abiding tension in my head since day 6 or so.  It's like I'm constantly on the verge of getting a headache.  It's not unbearable right now, but I remember that the last time I quit this feeling wore on for weeks and weeks and made me wonder whether there was any such thing as being comfortable as an ex-smoker.

I've noticed that as my willpower in quitting smoking has remained strong, my willpower in other areas has virtually disappeared.  I'm eating, spending and drinking much more than I know is good for me.  I'm not sure if this is something I should be alarmed about, or if I just need to give myself a break with these things for a while before I get my quitting "sea legs," as it were.  

I'm craving pretty much all the time, but I can't say I'm actually tempted to smoke.  Usually, all I have to do is think ahead to how I will feel after that initial nicotine hit has worn off, and any consideration of falling off the wagon disappears completely.  I've gone through quits where I fell off the wagon once every 2-3 weeks, and I don't want to put myself through that hell ever again.

Strangely, I'm having dreams about falling off the wagon, but not about smoking per se.  I don't dream about lighting, inhaling and feeling that hit of sweet, sweet nicotine course through my veins, but I do dream about remembering that I smoked some time before and feeling terrible about it.  I like to think that this is a sign of how strong my determination is this time.

Anyway, that's what's going on with me lately.  Any insights you guys might have would be appreciated.

I want to quit smoking

The main reason is I am starting to feel unhealthy when smoking and it doesn’t help my depression either.I started smoking to help my depression,but it seems to stopped working.I have been smoking for six month,starting on 4-5 sticks a day,for the past three month I have been on half a pack.I play football,and I think it’s also affecting my stamina level,meaning I start to feel tired after a while of running.
I now have a pack of champix and some nicotine patch,but also I like the idea of getting wellbutrin as I heard it can help my depression and also kick smoking habit...should I use champix or should I just try and get Wellbutrin?

I don’t think I have enough willpower to stop smoking myself even though I am only on half a pack and for 6 month

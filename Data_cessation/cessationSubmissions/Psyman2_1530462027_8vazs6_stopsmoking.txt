Track your health! You might have overlooked something!

Friends knew not to talk about smoking when I was around during my first two weeks of quitting to make sure I could get it off my mind.

Recently they've started pointing out minor things about myself I had either barely noticed or not at all.

Besides my smoker's cough being gone I have stopped feeling cold all the time.

Never even realized (or thought about) how two packs a day impacted my blood circulation. I haven't felt cold in a while, can breathe more freely (even started exercising again) and people have commented I look healthier without knowing I quit.

In case you need 'checkpoints' after quitting successfully (to keep you motivated), try tracking your health, revisiting your mental list every week or two to see how much it has improved :)

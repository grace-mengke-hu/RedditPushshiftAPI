So today will be day 1.

After many failed attempts of quitting. I've decided to quit but this time I'm going to document each day on here. I don't expect anyone to read it or comment on it, but if anyone does it will be a bonus. 

Starting with a bit about me, i'm 23 a software engineer based in cardiff (uk). Been smoking about 4 years started as an extra break on night shifts now can't go a day without them. 

After my final one this morning. I have thrown my pack and lighter away and will start a fresh. 
Will be posting again at the end of the day and will be continuing the posts as long as I feel they help. 

But yeah to new and smoke free start.

Day 1, had suicidal thoughts, smoked. Trying again though.

Yesterday I attempted to quit smoking cold turkey. The last time I quit, for three months, it was honestly easy. I remember being on edge but determined and the first few days flew by. 

This time was completely different. Around lunch the craving shot up to a 10 and stayed there the rest of the day. I was stuck in incredibly negative anxiety loops about the usual things - money, my health, my body - but incredibly intense. I actually found myself having suicidal thoughts and self harm urges at work, which is not like me at all, at least not since like five years ago. When I got home I stole a cigarette from my partners pack because I thought if there's any reason to abort a quit attempt, having recurring intrusive thoughts telling you to put your head in a vice is probably one of them.  I just wasn't prepared for it at all. 

Has anyone else had a reaction like this? Advice?

Motivation, for anyone who needs it. Plus bonus tip.

At about midday today, I made it over the 3 day hump. Cold turkey, too. With the exception of about an hour of serious cravings at the back end of day 2, it's been pretty smooth. Shouldn't have worried.

**Tip**


The last time I quit, as a little treat to myself I bought some expensive shower gel, shaving soap, cologne, all that jazz. I'd never used that kind of stuff before, and at that point it really helped me enjoy one of the big benefits of not smoking.


Anyway, when I quit again 3 days ago, I immediately started using all that expensive smelly stuff again and, again, it helped enormously to have that treat of (a) feeling pretty money washing with stuff that richer people than me wash with all the damned time, and (b) thinking "man, I smell _awesome_". Try it!

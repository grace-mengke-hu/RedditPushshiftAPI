A week in (again)

Smoked for about 4 years, quit for about 9 months, and then was a dumbass and started again June 2015. And now I'm a week into quitting again. 

It's going well. I'm using the app Smoke Free and enjoying the daily missions. Also each day I've been putting the money I would have spent on tobacco into a savings pot and I can't wait to treat myself to something nice (currently it's just over Â£10)

To people that have fallen off track and started smoking again, let me say this: quitting is SO much easier the second time around. Like, a hundred times better. So just give it a go and see :)

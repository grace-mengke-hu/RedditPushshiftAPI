Starting again. I need some advice and somebody to talk to.

I tried to quit several times, but never for more than 2 months. It always end up feeling like something bigger than me, about a radical change rather than quitting a habit. I only smoke when I drink which make things worse apparently, because I feel I need to put all this kind of life behind me, and it's really though. Well, just trying to vent a little.

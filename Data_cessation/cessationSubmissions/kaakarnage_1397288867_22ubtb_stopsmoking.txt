Last cigarette was today. What should I expect, and how should I prepare?

Last cigarette was around midnight. It's now almost 4am.

I have the Allen Carr book. 

As the title suggests, what should I expect? How should I prepare? 

I'm terrified of driving to work tomorrow, because I loved to smoke and drive...

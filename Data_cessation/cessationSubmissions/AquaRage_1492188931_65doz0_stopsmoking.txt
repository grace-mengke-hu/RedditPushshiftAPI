Quit quitting and stop starting!

Don't think of your addiction as some troll living in the hills that you have to go and vanquish. Your addiction boils down toa decision that you make right now. My friend always made the joke, "quitting cigarettes is easy - I do it all the time!" (Mark Twain?) The point is that quitting is an indefinite action - to many people it actually comes down to smoking one last cigarette! That's pretty much how addiction works.

So don't quit. Quitting is easy. You quit every time you put out a cigarette  and you start again every time you spark a new one. So just don't start anymore. 

Remember- you don't have to decide right now to never smoke again. You have to decide right now not to smoke right now, and at any given moment that's always in your best interest. Keep that thought with you at all times and wear it like armor.

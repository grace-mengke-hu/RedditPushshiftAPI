3 Days Cold-Turkey

I’m feelin it Mr. Krabs...

Cravings are getting intense today. 
So far I feel clean, and healthier. 
Breathing is better.
Cough is awful.
Definitely happy with my progress. 
I’d usually break by yesterday. 

Just having a hard time figuring out what to do when  I’m craving one. 

Quitting for me is like being locked down in a penitentiary. Everyone around me smokes. So I have to isolate. I’m bored. I’m not eating because I don’t want to eat too much to curb cravings. 

Why can’t life just remain as normal, just with NO SMOKING!

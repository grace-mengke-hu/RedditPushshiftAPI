It’s been 17 days and I’m getting angrier?

I haven’t smoked a cig in 17 days. One morning at work, I crushed a pack and said fuck this shit. It’s been going okay, considering everyone I work with smokes atleast a pack a day. But recently, I feel myself getting upset at little things for no reason. Anyone else experience this?

Dealing with the boredom

It’s been six days (and ten hours) and I noticed in the past week I just can not sit at home anymore. I can’t just sit down, watch Netflix or play a game anymore. 

This feels like my biggest trigger, which is quite difficult, considering I am a bit of a loner and I don’t currently have much of a social life. My life feels so boring without my smokes and I know this is my addiction talking. But it still feels like it.

Yesterday I went to see two (!!) movies in the cinema because I just couldn’t be at home. I get very bad anxiety attacks (which isn’t uncommon, but the quitting made it a lot worse)

Does anyone have any tips, or should I just keep escaping my house for now? Although I am craving smokes, I don’t think I am at the risk of giving up, I don’t want to. I want to be able to post that “100 days”, “1000 cigarettes not smoked” screen shot as well. I want to reach that moment where it won’t dictate my life anymore.

And I don’t want to smell anymore, although I am still not quite sure on how I feel about my improved smell. Things can stink sometimes.

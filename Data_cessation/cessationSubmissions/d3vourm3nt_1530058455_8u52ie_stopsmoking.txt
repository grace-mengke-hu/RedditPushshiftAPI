Went 4 days. Then broke up with my girlfriend and now I'm chain-smoking again.

I know the line "cigarettes don't make you less stressed" but God damn is there something comforting about drinking a couple beers and smoking on the back patio after a horrible day.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Why is there a trend of smoking a cigarette and keeping your badge?

The point of the badge is for days not smoked. I keep seeing comments and posts of "just a cigarette" so they "didn't reset." I know it's self-service and an honor system, but this type of thing is just inflating numbers and it also sets a bad example for those who are freshly quitting. 

Slip ups do happen. It's human. We should hold ourselves accountable for that. If you're in AA, NA, or any groups that stay sober: even a little taste of your drug of choice is cause to turn in your badge and replace it for a starter. The point is to have 0.

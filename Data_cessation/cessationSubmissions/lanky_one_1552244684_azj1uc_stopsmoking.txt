I smoked for 35 years. I told myself I would quit when I turned 50. My birthday was 12 days ago. It's been tough.

I've always set my 50th birthday as the date I would quit. Stopping the habit after 35 years has been a challenge. I've tried unsuccessfully many times throughout my life to quit, so I knew what I was up against, because I've had lots of practice. It's been 12 days, and I've been battling through it. I'm also really enjoying the feeling of accomplishment and pride, and waking up in the morning no longer wheezing.
Some of you feel like you can't quit, or you don't have it in you, or you don't have the willpower like others. I've felt that way my entire life, and others here have the same feelings. You're not alone. Your cravings get less intense, and less frequent. Always remember that. Toughen yourself up for those cravings, and talk yourself through it.

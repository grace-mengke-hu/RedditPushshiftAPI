I bought a pack of cigarettes today after 577 days...

For my father.

;X It felt weird, strange, dirty and foreign. I almost stuttered during the transaction because it didn't feel right. 

My father will never quit, and he asked me to pick him up a pack while I was out. 

Still going strong though! :)

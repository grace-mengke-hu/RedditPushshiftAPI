Recently became pregnant, any tips?

I know most say "Morning Sickness" helps them quit smoking. I'm afraid I won't get morning sickness. I'm still early enough that it might happen soon, but curious of my options if not.   I also believe the best time to do this is early due to articles explaining that Nicotine Lozenges and Gums decrease or increase blood flow which would be bad. Also read going cold turkey leads to bad results later on. I want to do what's best. I appreciate any help.

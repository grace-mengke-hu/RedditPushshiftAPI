2 weeks without a cig!

Quit two weeks ago after my girlfriend was sick and hadn't smoked in 2 days. Suggested we both quit since she'd been through the tough days. I smoked American spirits blacks and tbh it was so much easier quitting those than typical brands. I quit once before for 5 months and kicking the 27's to the curb was not easy at all. This time was smoother for sure. Loving the money I'm saving so far.

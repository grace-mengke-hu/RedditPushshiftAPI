Anger is a gift? Day 4.

   For years I’ve been trying to quit, knowing that my health, my child, or any number of reasonable, rational things should provide proper drive. None of it works. I go maybe a day or two and that’s it.


  This time, I’m on day 4, and I’m confident I’ll quit because I have total motivation, which I found in anger. I’m not saying it’s right or healthy, but it works for me. I’m mad as hell at my SO, I’m mad as hell over some other bullshit in my life, and this is how I’m channeling my epic internal “f you” temper tantrum.
   

  My withdrawal “discomfort” turns me (mentally) into one of those giant meat heats (god bless) at the serious part of the gym. In my head I’m all:


    “You’re the toughest MFer alive! YEAHHHH”!!
  “I will DESTROY MY ENEMIES”!
   “I’m the BADDEST BITCH ALIVE AND NOTHING CONTROLS MEEEEEEE!!!”

  I feel all of this, and despite the fact that I’m a 5’2, 40 year old mother who enjoys volunteering and cooking, I believe every word of it right now.

  Wait...is withdrawal psychosis a thing?

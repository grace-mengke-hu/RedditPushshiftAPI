100 days!

Well, tomorrow will be 100 days smoke free, and being a struggle is an understatement! It has been pure hell, full of ups and downs, just when I think it's getting easier, and the cravings are getting few and far between, they come back and hit me like a ton of bricks! The struggle is real, it's hell, it sucks, all I can say, is I keep pushing forward taking it 1 day at a time, hoping and praying that one day, and one day SOON, it does get easier! I've been changing things up, going to the gym, trying to make this easier, but it's just not working, so for now, day by day is all I can do. Hopefully once winter is over and the weather gets nicer and I can get outside more, maybe then, just maybe then, I'll finally catch a break!

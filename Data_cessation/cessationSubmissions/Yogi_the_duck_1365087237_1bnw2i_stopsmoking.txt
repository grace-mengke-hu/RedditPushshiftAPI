Day 1. Fuck

I haven't smoked since 5 or 6 pm last night (pst) and now I'm sitting at my desk at work craving. I've only been up for 3 hours and I feel like I'm going to put my fist through a wall or a door. This sucks, bought a pack of gum to chew on to stop gritting my teeth so much. Anyone have any advice?

I stopped smoking using Chantix, and am now angrier than I've ever been

Well, by stopped smoking I mean I've gone two weeks without smoking after a decade of a pack a day. I think two weeks is a little early for my victory lap but feel proud I've made it this far! The subsiding effects of smoking has been a wonderful feeling. I have no doubt it's due to the Chantix.

That said, I am the worst version of myself on Chantix. A version of myself I have never been. I've been so irritable at work, that if someone said the wrong thing at the wrong time I wouldn't hesitate to risk losing my job through an angry reaction. My fiance and I have always had great communication skills and conflict resolution handled in a productive, mature manner. It's not that we didn't have disagreements, it's that we were able to discuss the issue in a calm demeanor. 

For the first time since we've been together, I made her cry last night. I didn't even feel all that bad about it at the time. I went to bed knowing she was hurt by what I said, that I could've handled it differently, and that my reaction was pure irritability. I think it caught her off guard more than anything. We've had more arguments since I started the medication, than we have in the entirety of our relationship. That might be an exaggeration but it feels like it.

Last night as I closed my eyes and drifted off to her sniffles, I decided I'm done with it. I am appreciative for what it did, and hopefully it taught me how to live without cigarettes, but my worst of days smoking had been better than my best on this medication.

I guess the moral of this post is, Chantix was effective for me quitting undoubtedly. I don't know why, but I was able to refrain from smoking even with the habitual craving still there. In that aspect, it is awesome. But, if your experience is anything like mine, prepare to feel like a different person for a few weeks, one that you may not like.

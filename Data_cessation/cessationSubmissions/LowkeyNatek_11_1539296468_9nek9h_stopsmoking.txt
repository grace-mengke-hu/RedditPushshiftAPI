On to day 5, yesterday was rough

I am halfway through day five, yesterday the cravings were insane, like every little thing annoyed me. By reading Allen Carrs book I was able to get my mind brainwashed and I have no desire to smoke anymore, but the mental cravings are killer, ive taken to doing daily meditations, Praying and working out and i have been tracking everything with the smoke free app. I also still go out side with the smokers because it was a social thing for me but i have no desire to join them in smoking which is what has convinced me that I have quit for good this time. I hope things begin to get easier I smoked for 4 years and my body feels better now than it ever has before, kicking it cold turkey was the best decision I've ever made.

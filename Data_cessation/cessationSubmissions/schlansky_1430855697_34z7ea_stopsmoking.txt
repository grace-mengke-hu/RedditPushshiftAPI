300 Days of self-actualization

So... 300 days without a single cigarette. The last time I could have said that was when I was 13 years old. I am 27 now.
I tried to quit so many times over the years and it never worked. But I never failed. I just learned how it doesnÂ´t work.

Recently I realized that I am glad that it was that hard. That it made me insane at times. That it made me doubt myself. I am happy about all the sleepless nights and horrible moments. All of it.
Because it makes that feeling I have right now so much better. The things I had to do and experience... They were terrible but made me so much stronger. I am proud of myself and anyone who keeps on fighting. Keep on fighting, it gets better. And than it gets great.

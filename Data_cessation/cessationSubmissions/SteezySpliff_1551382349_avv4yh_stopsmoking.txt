I think I'm ready. But admittedly I'm afraid.

I'll try to keep this short....

I'm a 29 yo Male, and have been a pack a day smoker for almost 10 years now. I love it. I love the first cigarette of the day, the cigarette after a good meal/ couple drinks, and the cigarette after some good sex. It's the rest of them I could do with out. 

I know in my mind that I'm ready to stop. My reason is mainly that I could do a lot with the extra 70+ dollars in my weekly budget among others. 

I've never tried to quit, I was never gonna lie to myself before and say that I wanted to as I enjoyed it too much and still do. But I've been thinking a lot about it lately and the one thing holding me back is fear. 

I'm afraid. 

I'm afraid of who I'll become and how it will affect my relationships, work performance, and my personality. 

I'm afraid of what I'll substitute the addiction with. 

I guess what I'm looking for is some advice and experiences of people that have gone through with it. How did you feel? did it affect your life in anyway? Do you miss it? Is my fear unwarranted?

I'd like to say in advance that I appreciate your time and thank you.

Finally decided enough was enough.

I have been a smoker on and off for over 20 years and decided now is the time to quit for good.  The main reason I want to quit is a promise I made to my daughter.  She asked me to stop smoking several times and my reply was always that I would soon.  I want to stop saying soon and start living up to my promise.  I had my last smoke at 10:00 last night and want it to be my last ever.  Anyways, I have lurked here long enough and want to thank all of you who helped to inspire me and show me it can be done. This community is incredibly supportive and I want to be a part of it, especially the part that encourages others to quit by sharing my success in doing so.

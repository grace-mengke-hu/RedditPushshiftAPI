First day smoke free, any suggestions on how to fight the cravings?

I've been smoking strong tobacco (15-20 rolled cigarettes a day) and a couple of days ago I decided that today I would quit. My willpower is not a great friend of mine, so I already started this morning smoking a mini joint. Even though it stopped the first craving, it's neither stopping smoking nor suitable for workdays. Any suggestions on how to fight the cravings efficiently? Anything would be appreciated, thank you guys!

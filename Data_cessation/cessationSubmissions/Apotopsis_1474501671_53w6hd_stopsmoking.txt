Should I start with 7mg patch?

Hey all, So I'm tired of smoking and i'm ready to quit. I've cut my smoking down to around 5-6 cigarettes a day for about the last three weeks. I was thinking about trying the nicotine patches again; since I don't smoke ten cigs a day i'd rather not give myself more nicotine than I get already.
I was wondering if wearing the 7mg patch for maybe a month or so would work to keep the cravings at bay while I broke my smoking routines? 
Has anyone tried this? 
Thanks,

Looking to stop using nicotine lozenges? Try these.

For a long time after I quit, I used the nicotine lozenges.  I started off with the 4mg and then moved down to the 2.  I was ready to get off the 2mg for a long time but still felt like I wanted a mint or something.  The problem is that regular mints last about 12 seconds, and the lozenges last a long time so it wasn't quite the same. Then I found [forever mints](http://forevermints.com/), and they've been a great replacement with no nicotine.  Obviously, I still have some of my addiction issues to deal with, but I feel that this is a lot better than the lozenges, just like the lozenges were a lot better than the smokes.  One step at a time...

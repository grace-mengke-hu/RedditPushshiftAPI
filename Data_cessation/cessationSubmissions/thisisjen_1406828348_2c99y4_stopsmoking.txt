Tips on how to break out of an infinite loop?

I have been lurking here for a while.  I have smoked for 11 years - quit a few times but I have always enjoyed smoking and never REALLY wanted to kick the habit.  Last month something changed, started exercising regularly, and started to really look at my addiction.  I realized I HATE everything about smoking, and resolved to quit.

For the past month I have tried many different methods - Alan Carr, NRT, slowly reducing the amount I smoke everyday.  I've had small successes in the amount of time I'm able to go between smokes... BUT I ALWAYS BOUNCE BACK.  **I have not made it even one day.**.. After a MONTH of trying!  I feel so ashamed, useless, and helpless. I hate this... So why can't I just kick it?

Your amazing stories have helped me get where I am mentally, but if anyone has any tips on how to break this stupid loop I'd be extremely grateful.  You are all amazing and so inspiring - yet I fear perhaps stronger people than myself :(

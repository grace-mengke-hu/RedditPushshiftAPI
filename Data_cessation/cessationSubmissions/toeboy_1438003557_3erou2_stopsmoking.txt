Officially starting today.

my SO and i have been smokers for 2-3 years and bought our last pack over the weekend and smoked our last cigarette Saturday night, and had a reburn on Sunday afternoon. (around 1-2 pm).

after that, we were done. i'm now at work and both of us are struggling with the cravings, but we have the will power to quit. 

i've been a lurker for some time here, but now i'm ready to really become apart of the community, for i might need some help once the withdrawals start heavily kicking in.

anyway, you guys are the ones that inspired me to quit smoking for good. so, i appreciate that.

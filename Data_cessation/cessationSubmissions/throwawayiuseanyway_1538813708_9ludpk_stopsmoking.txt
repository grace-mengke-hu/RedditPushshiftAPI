3-day vent

It hasn't been too bad. The worst part has been that most people don't know, so there hasn't been a lot of personal support. I've been reading this sub though, and it has helped. I like seeing other people who are in their first days and weeks, because there's where I want to get to.

I smoked for a long time, maybe since 1996 or so? Around 2012 I started to pick up vaping, which was a lifesaver to me. I'm guessing there's mixed feelings about it here but I felt much better the next day. I worked my way down to 6mg at low power but I would still get nicotine withdrawl if I tried to go without it.

I recently decided to make an effort to give it up completely. I went to 0mg juice in my vape and did the patch starting at 14mg. That went fairly smoothly although I was surprised how much I continued to vape, even with no nicotine. 

Once I got to my last patch, I stopped with the vaping. Just emptied and cleaned the tank one last time and didn't refill it. I made myself sick the first night with food &amp; sweets but since then I've pulled back on that (I still have hard candy and kava &amp; chamomile teas and toothpicks etc etc.)

Part of the reason for this is I'm moving to a new house and I don't want to mess around with going outside to vape or smoke. The vaping has made it easier I think -- nicotine is hard but cigarettes seem way more cracky-addictive. I figure I'm in a good spot with 3 days and now I can get through the weekend. I like to stay at home and watch tv/youtube (so glad I found "maniac" on netflix) but I also go out even if it's just to go to the store and buy a bottle of water, or ride around on a limebike.

I guess this is a big enough wall of text, people know how it is, so I'll just leave it at this. I look forward to having 5 days, a week, 2 weeks, months, a year, etc :) Thanks to this community for being here so I know I'm not alone.

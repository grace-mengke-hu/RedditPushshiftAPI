Jest keep saying to myself "don't do it"

Just another knock down, all I want to do right now is go buy cigarettes , but I know, I Really don't want to, it's just my emotions getting the best of me, being mad, being sad, angry, just have to keep telling myself. Don't do it, ive come to far!  hopefully, this to shall pass. Sorry, just had to get it out there.

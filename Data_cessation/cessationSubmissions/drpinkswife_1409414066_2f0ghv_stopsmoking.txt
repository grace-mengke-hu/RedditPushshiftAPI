Pub Lunch - Update

Pork and leek sausage with mash and a pint of Peroni. OMG that was the tastiest lunch in forever!!! And Peroni totally tastes different, heavier, weird. I think I still like lager. More investigation may be needed.

There was a smelly wet dog in the pub, but that didn't bother me.

Got a little tipsy. Went for a constitutional after lunch in the church graveyard across the road in Sarratt. (I can say where it is because I don't live there).

I forgot to want to smoke. I FORGOT to want to smoke. Completely didn't think of doing it.

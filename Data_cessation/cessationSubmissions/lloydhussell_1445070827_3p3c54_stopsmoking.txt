3 weeks nicotine and THC free.

I am a 22 year old male who has been smoking both from the age of 13 years old. I stopped 3 weeks back and it has been an experience, to say the least. I think 2 nights over the 3 weeks I have had 5 hours sleep. The other nights have been 2/3 hours between each rest. Honestly, I am sick and tired of these withdrawals as I used to lead a busy life even while smoking, and now I do nothing because of it. If anyone has, or is, going through the same problems it would be very nice if you could chip in.

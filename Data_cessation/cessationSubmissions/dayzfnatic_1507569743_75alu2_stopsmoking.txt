Quit smoking at 20, should I be worried about my health?

Let me explain, I am someone who has severe health anxiety and I am still worried about the havoc I have wreaked on my body through my addiction to tobacco, do I have anything to worry about or is it all in my head? I've never smoked more than 10 cigarettes in a day when I was smoking.

18 days in. Feel shitty lately.

It may be related to something else more than just not smoking but lately I've been focusing so much on a healthy lifestyle it's kind of making me anti-social; I'm doing a lot of things with my life lately that aren't bad for me one bit, but I think stress is maybe just weighing down on me? As if I'm worried I'm going to fail.

Now its 8:16pm On a friday night and all my friends are egging me to go out; but I kind of just want to sit in my room. Anyone else get like this? I feel if I go out tonight I'll shove a pack down my face.

Sorry needed to rant. :d

Binge smoking.

Hi all! 

I've been smoking on and off for ten years. I can go a week or two without a single cig but when something traumatic happens or causes me great anxiety, I'm ashamed to say I will buy a pack and binge smoke until it's gone. :( I have terrible anxiety issues and I'm on medication for it but this still happens.

Has anyone else experienced this? What would you suggest I do in these times when I really need 15-20 cigarettes to get through the day? I feel awful afterward but I find that e cigs and gum just don't do the trick.?

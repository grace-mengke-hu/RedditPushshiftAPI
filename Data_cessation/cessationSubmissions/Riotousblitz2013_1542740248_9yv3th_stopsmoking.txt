I want to quit

Ok so sorry in advance I'm on mobile and formatting sucks


Ok so I have been smoking for roughly 16 years now since I was 9 years old to now. I quit for about 5 years, but picked it back up when my wife decided she wanted a divorce, it's been about a year, I now live across the country with my parents. The only real issue I see (I quit cold turkey when I moved across the country for my wife) is that my parents Smoke in the house about 2 packs a day each. How should I best cope with the second hand smoke? Or should I just wait a month or two until I move out?

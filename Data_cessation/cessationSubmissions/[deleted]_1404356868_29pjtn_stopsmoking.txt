Only made it 19 hours

I made it 19 hours before I realized I had a meeting at work on alcohol education I needed to be aware of attending. The following day I had a psychiatrist appointment where I wanted to cover more than whining over my lack of nicotine. Still I did not buy a pack, but I feel during those days I was something worse. A bum. I bummed cigarettes at work and I feel horrible. They won't let me repay them. Then last night I had an anxiety attack and that was my breaking point. Mid attack I bought a pack. I'm going to a doctor Monday to start on anti anxiety meds, which I have a ten mile long family history of, but I managed with meditation and apparently cigarettes. On the plus side though, I've replaced soda with juicy juice and do feel much better for that. But I failed again this year. I plan to try again once I've got my anxiety under control. But hey, my schizophrenia is actually a slew of other issues that she can't find a diagnosis for and are having me help research to find and I'm excited about that. Sorry for the sad dump, but y'all seem to have the best answers and advice.

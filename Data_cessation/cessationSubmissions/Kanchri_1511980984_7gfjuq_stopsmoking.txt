Female Quitters

Day 76 cold turkey quit after ~27 yrs of 20 cigarettes a day. 

Are your hormones all over the place since quitting all forms of nicotine? On day 5 of my quit my face broke out with horrible acne and hasn't let up yet. Stomach bloat is beyond anything I've ever experienced. Weight gain, mood swings, and haven't had a period since August. 
I'll be going to a doctor in the next couple of weeks to have some blood work done (specifically thyroid tests) but was wondering if I was just lucky enough to get every terrible side effect from quitting or if anyone else has been through this?

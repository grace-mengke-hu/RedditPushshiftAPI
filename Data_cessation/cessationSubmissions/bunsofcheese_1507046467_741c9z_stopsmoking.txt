Almost 10 months later and still a lot of anger.

I stopped smoking because my doctor told me that i would have a heart attack within the next 5 to 10 years if i didn't stop smoking.  I did it using zyban and the patch, though i only used the patch for the first week.

The actual quitting was relatively painless, but the thing that's stuck is the anger.  I get (internally) a bit rage-y when i smell cigarette (or pot) smoke in places where I feel like I shouldn't have to smell it.  For example, if someone walks by my apartment window and smokes and I smell it, I get angry, when someone at work comes back to their desk after a smoke break and I smell it, i get angry, if i have to walk through a bunch of smokers to get into a coffee shop/office tower/store, i get angry.  

I ride my bike to work every day, year round.  I love riding my bike because it is - well, *was* - the one place i thought i could be free of second hand smoke, until the other day when this other cyclist with his big giant headphones pushed past me on his bike, smoking a cigarette, then proceeded to block me from getting past.  Eventually I just stopped so that he could get far ahead - so that i didn't shoulder-check him into traffic.

How do I stop this anger?  I've caught myself becoming more outspoken about it to people instead of suffering silently, but the truth is, it just makes me look like an angry dude and I don't want to be angry.

does anyone else experience this?  if so, what helped you?

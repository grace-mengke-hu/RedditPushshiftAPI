Yesterday was day 10

I work Monday-Friday so weekends aren’t as big a deal since my wife doesn’t smoke. That makes those days much easier. 

Today is day 11 and I’ve got to work with a particularly annoying coworker today. My old strategy was to smoke to get away from him. 

Now I’ll probably translate into rushing through the work day and not getting paid for a full day. Long term that’s worth it though.

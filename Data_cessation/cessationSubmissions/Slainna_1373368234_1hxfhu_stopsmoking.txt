But I don't wanna!

I started smoking years and years ago. Sometimes I smoke 2 cigs a day, sometimes I smoke a pack and a half a day. My husband lost his grandmother who raised him to lung cancer so he's horrified by it. The thing is I don't really want to! I love the taste, the smell (unless it's cheap and ew), and the relaxation it makes me feel. However, it makes my husband miserable and it hurts my endurance running. I am aware of the ingredients, the health effects, and the social effects but dammit I like it! The more people push me, the more I push back because I'm simply stubborn.  

I love my husband and want to make him happy but if I quit just for him, I'd resent it. What do?

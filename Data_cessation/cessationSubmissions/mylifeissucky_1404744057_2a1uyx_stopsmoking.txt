HA! Not much craving at all in the morning

first thing like yesterday!! I have my 3rd day of NOT Smoking-and it isn't hard like I feared by far. Just the wierd ebb of triggers and few real cravings, except the other and yesterday morning first thing. Outside of those, it really slowed down. The kicker is, I smoked nearly a pack a day!!

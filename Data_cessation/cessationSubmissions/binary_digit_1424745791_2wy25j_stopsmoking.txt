Checking in. 1 week flair!

[I wanted to stop in and show off my new flair.](http://imgur.com/vC8DWAq)  

Thanks very much to everyone who helped to make quitting easy.  I came to this subreddit on Jeff the diseased lung's birthday, to finally quit smoking once and for all.  At the time, I thought I was making a decision to give something up.  Thanks again /u/my_vape_self  for reccomending Allen Carr's Easy Way to Stop Smoking.  

To be honest, I only read it because I had heard that you weren't supposed to stop smoking until you finished the book, and I was looking for an excuse to buy another pack.  I didn't think the book would help/work.  I was prepared for the Cold Turkey fight.

I smoked 5 of those cigarettes before I finished the book, and I have been liberated from the evil weed!  My little monster is dead!  I can't believe how easy it has been to quit.  I can't thank you enough for all of your support.  

To anybody who is new to the subreddit, welcome and join me in not smoking today!

What to do after the 14 day mark...

I've passed the 14-day mark. I've been to this point before, and physically I don't feel the pull. I just feel emotionally exhausted. Does anyone ever get to the point where they just get tired? I feel like whenever I get to this point, I return to smoking. If only because I don't know what to do without smoking. There just isn't any motivation, and I am going to spend all day grappling with this issue. Maybe tomorrow will be easier.

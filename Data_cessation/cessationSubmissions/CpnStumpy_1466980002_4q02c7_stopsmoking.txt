Stupid trick I'm trying to help me quit

So I've been smoking ~8 months and and it's gotten rather heavy for the past year - worst of all I went from rolled natural tobacco to "all-natural cigarettes" so people at work didn't think I was smoking a joint. Bad move - "all natural" tobacco just means they put all the extra-addictive additives in the papers. Humbug.

 

So I just ..."stopped" (was ~6-8 a day, only had 2 the day before yesterday and 1 yesterday - and I will have none today! Promise! :| ugh)  and I'm trying the stupidest trick to help- which may or may not help:

 

I'm fasting because it's something I've done off and on for years (not a body image thing, I had little food growing up, and as an adult just found it made me feel healthy to do periodically, as well as being easy for me because of my raising) and the food craving when I do it is something I'm good at ignoring. I find it's giving me a distraction from thinking about the cigarette (not so much the first day, but yesterday and today my stomach has become a bit more vocal and drowning out the cigarette cravings).

 

Not sure if this is working, I'm certain it seems like a really stupid idea, but fuck it- can't hurt to try, and it does *feel* like it's helping. It's like how a nurse pinches you when giving you a stick so your body focuses on something other than the needle.

 

On the bright side, wife is out of town which means I'm not picking fights with anyone this weekend! Ideally that will stay the same tomorrow when I go back to work... here's hoping. NoWhammiesNoWhammiesNoWhammies

 

Has anyone else tried anything similar or heard of any such idea? (Let's be honest, I'm pretty sure I stumbled into doing it because my wife's out of town for a week and I was too lazy to food for just myself, especially since I'm not food motivated at all)

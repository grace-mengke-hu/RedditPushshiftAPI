Thank you Reddit!

I found this site through a no smoking app and you guys all rock! I love how when I have a craving someone is here and when I can't sleep (like now it's 1.38am) someone is here I know I'm 2 days into my quit so fairly new but this time feels well different and it's mainly down to this site and the people on it so thank you!

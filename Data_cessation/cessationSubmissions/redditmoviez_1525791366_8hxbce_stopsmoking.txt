The feeling of withdrawals feels simultaneously awful and amazing.

I've been smoke free for 7 days now, and I must say how strange the sensation is. On the one hand I feel dreadful, especially when my cravings come along, I can get irritable as hell and flip out over the smallest of annoyances, and then quickly find myself laughing over getting angry over the first place. I feel sluggish, sometimes flu-like, really, withdrawal is NO JOKE. If this is even half of what it's like to get off of heroin, then more power to those individuals. My head is foggy at times, i'll get muscle spasms, and just generally feel sick. 

Yet on the other hand, I feel absolutely incredible. I can feel my body healing itself and expelling of the toxins. I'm starting to have more energy, more stamina, my anxiety and depression has noticeably decreased, my heart isn't racing constantly, and somehow I've discovered this new found confidence that I wasn't expecting. I'm a pretty meek person who hates conflict, and if someone is an ass hole to me or says something in the negative, I'd normally just be passive and quiet and hold it in. But now I find I'm standing up for myself more and not being afraid of speaking up. This could just be from the fact that I'm so proud of my progress of quitting these nasty things that for years I thought I never could, that that somehow gives me more strength in other areas. Like "well, if I can do this, there's nothing I CAN'T do"

Anyway, I love checking my quit smoking app and seeing my progress. It keeps me going when it gets rough. On top of that I've already saved 115 dollars IN ONE WEEK. Which is pretty amazing. 

I keep hearing the second and third week are the worst, but I'm so motivated that I feel ready to take it on. Ahh, this is great/awful, but mostly great. 

Seriously, if you are reading this considering quitting smoking, DO IT.

Tried to quit so many times...

Like the title says, I've tried so many times.

Was a smoker for 10 years, quit for 6, been smoking for the past 2.

I've tried multiple times this past few months, to no avail. I'll be good for a day, but that nicotine always comes in and tricks me into 'just one more cig isn't gonna do anything' and the cycle goes on.

I see all the success stories on here, and I (in a good way) envy you guys, those who have done it.

I don't think I'm asking for advice, as much as I'm venting to a group of people who will understand. It hinders a lot of my life, and I just want to quit already. I don't even like it that much, it's just an addiction.

Hopefully my next post will be when I actually quit. Credit to those who have quit, you're an inspiration on here.

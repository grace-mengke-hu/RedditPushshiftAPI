It's been two days, 10 hours and 46 minutes since my last cigarette and I wanted to say thanks!

I'm a 28 year old woman and I have been a smoker, on and off, for about 10 years. Recently, I started working from home and increased my cigarette consumption to over a pack a day. 

I quit because I want to become a mom within the next year and I figured I better stop poisoning my insides if I want to have a baby. 

A lot of people in this sub recommended the Alan Carr EASYWAY book and it's definitely helped me to see that cigarettes don't actually make anything better, they make everything worse.

It's just so hard to not reach for them when I'm bored, or want to get some air (haha, what a fallacy, getting fresh air while smoking a cigarette), or if I'm the slightest bit irritated. Instead of having this crutch to escape with, I have to just move through my emotions without the help of my little white stick. It's hard but I know it'll be worth it. 

Today has been the hardest day because it's Monday and I take Adderall for my ADHD on the weekdays. The stimulant makes me want to smoke so badly, but I don't give in. I feel sick from the combination of the pill and the lack of nicotine. 

I think the best way I can describe quitting smoking is to imagine a vegas marquee billboard. You know, the ones with all the bright lights. Ok, imagine a marquee that says CIGRARETTES! all in uppercase red letters, screaming at you. Each time you defeat a craving for a cigarette, another bulb explodes. With each passing craving the lights go out, one by one, and the sign gets dimmer and dimmer until soon you can't even see it anymore. I just hope I can stay away from the replacement bulbs.

Anyways, thank you all for being here, your stories are very encouraging. Best of luck to everyone!

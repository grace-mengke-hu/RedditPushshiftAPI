Day 4: stomach ache, constipation

So let me preface this by saying I actually successfully quit for two years and just went back to it for a month or two (I live in France, it's still sexy here).  Anyway, I'm not having any trouble with the cravings, but it feels like my digestive system has completely shut down and I've hardly been able to drop a deuce for the past couple days.  Eating fruit, drinking coffee and lots of water, still feel it bloating up inside me.  Tempted to buy a pack just to flush my system out...halp!

long distance relationship; going to visit a smoker

I quit smoking approximately a week ago. Had a couple slip-ups, a puff here or there on day 4/5 but not a full cigarette since my quit date. I've smoked for 10 years at least a pack a day, (27 yo). My birthday is next month and I have vowed that I will not be a smoker by my 28th, that 10 years is enough.

The main reason for this post though is that I'm going to visit a smoker next week. I'm flying half way across the country to go see this guy. The last time we saw each other we were both smokers. Now I've quit, I'm wondering if anyone has advice for how to deal with being around someone you're intimate with who smokes. 

I'm also worried about the realization of smelling and kissing a smoker. Any advice on how to deal with it? I've quit before, I know how bad smokers smell. I'm not sure I've ever kissed a smoker when I wasn't smoking though.

I'm afraid I'll give into temptation. Honestly I'm not sure an occasional drag would be a bad thing? But I'm more worried about completely breaking down and buying a pack while I'm hanging out with him.

What advice would you give me to keep quit without making it awkward with my SO who I don't see very often? I know that quitting is a personal choice I wouldn't ask him not to smoke around me or to change his habitats just because I happen to be around.

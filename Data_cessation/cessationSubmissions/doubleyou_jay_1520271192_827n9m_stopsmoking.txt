Nicotine free vape to help quit???

So I have been smoke/nicotine free for 2 weeks now and while it has not been fun I am very proud of myself and feel better already.  In the past I have quit and started back when drinking so I have been steering clear of alcohol completely or drinking in small quantities thus far.  I have been hiding out at home for the most part. I do have plans to go out to dinner and drinks with some friends this weekend and I am excited to get back to my normal life.  I can’t hide forever and I do enjoy a drink from time to time and it’s not something I want to give up as well.
  I was thinking about getting a nicotine free vape for when those drunk intense cravings hit. Wondering if the act of vaping was enough to appease anyone’s cravings in the quit process?  I don’t the vape become a regular thing though. Thinking just when drinking.  Anyone have any experience with this???  

Thanks, congrats and best wishes to all of you!

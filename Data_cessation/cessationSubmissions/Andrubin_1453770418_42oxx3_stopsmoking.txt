Vaping not smoking. But I'm not sure where to go.

I started vaping going into my senior year of highschool. I have never have smoked a cigarette and don't want to. I have finally admitted myself that I am definitely addicted to it. It's only 3 or 6mg of nicotine and it's not that bad for you but I can't help but feel that it's bringing me down in my studies and my fitness which is very important to me. I've had lame attempts to quit but never really tried it. I hate the feeling of cravings. I've never experienced anything like it in my life as I've always been healthy. I'm not sure how or if I can do this or whether I even need to. But any advice would be greatly appreciated.

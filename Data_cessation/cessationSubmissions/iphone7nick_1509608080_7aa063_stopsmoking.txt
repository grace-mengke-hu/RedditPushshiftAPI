Reddit! I want to stop smoking, I also would like some opinions.

Hi! I’ve been smoking now for 12 years, I’m now 28. Recently I’ve found that I get out of breath very quickly even when talking! I have these symptoms where I am so tired all the time and I’m lightheaded constantly. ( and I mean constantly ) I’ve seen my GP, I’ve had a full blood count which came back normal! My CRP ( I think that’s what is it ) was normal! It’s what the look at to see if your body is in disease mode. I’ve had a MRI on my ears and head, all normal. I’ve had a ECG also, and you guessed it.. normal. I suffer from GAD which my doctor seems to think my symptoms relate too? I think I’m unfit and the smoking for so many years is taking its toll on my body and my body is telling me to stop. I want to stop, but as many of you know it’s very hard. I would like your opinions on my situation please, I would be most grateful for them and any advice. Thank you!

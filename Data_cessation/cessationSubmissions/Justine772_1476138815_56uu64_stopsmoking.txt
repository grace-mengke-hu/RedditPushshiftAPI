When will my body fully recover?

I've been smoking for 4 years now (since around the time I turned 16...) I've tried to quit so many times. I'm about to smoke the last cig in my pack (I know, I should just throw it away, but I spent *moneys* damn it). I smoked around half a pack a day. I have quit a few times before, for around 3 months each before falling off the wagon. This time I'm using nicotine gum (as cold turkey just physically hurts 24/7 for... well, forever.) 

Online there's a bunch of info on when the *average* smoker heals, but I imagine that's for people who've smoked more/longer than me. About how long could I expect for my lungs to repair all the damage and clear out? Or is it really the same recovery time for all smokers, regardless of how long they were hooked?

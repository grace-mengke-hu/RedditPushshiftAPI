What do with my hands?

Initially, I switched to an e-cig, but I was having unrelated nausea problems so stopped using it in case that was causing it after a few days. Now that I've been nicotine free for so long, I don't want to start again just to satisfy the need to inhale. I was smoking only roll-ups for 14 years (since I was 12) and the biggest problem is finding something to do with my hands and not mistaking the feeling of needing to do something with hunger. There's really no risk I'll start again, I have anxiety problems anyway so going to buy tobacco, Rizla, filters and a lighter is kind of a huge deal (first time my anxiety's been helpful for anything, yay?). I temporarily stopped going to social things with smokers, but managed to go to a smoking couple's house last weekend and didn't even feel tempted, just enjoyed the smell.

But when I'm home alone, I just feel like I need to do something with my hands all the time. I actually feel like not smoking isn't the problem, not rolling cigarettes is. Any ideas?

Double Figures!

Finally on a quit attempt that hasnt failed within the first few days. Couple of new factors keeping me going, health concerns, new boyfriend, sorting out finances...usually by this point I've had a cheeky puff and justified it as nobodys perfect.
I will (!) Keep this run going!!!!!! 10 days down...1 million to go :)

Very proud moment today. Thanks to my son.


A little bit about me. Been smoke-free for 274 days. I’m a stay at home dad with 2 kids (ages 6 and 2).

Today was a rough day. I've been stressed and annoyed all morning cuz the kids are the worst. No one is listening. Huge mess throughout the whole house. How is there chocolate on the ceiling? I give up.
-- I drive my oldest to school and then I have to run some errands and go to Walmart.  As I run to get inside Walmart because it's so nasty and rainy out, I start to put Chris (my 2yo) into the cart.  At that moment the clouds dispersed and the heavens opened and shined a ray of light into the cart... Angels sing, “Ahhhhhhhh!” There I see it... A beautiful box of Parliament lights.. I think to myself "ahh the carts all wet I'm sure it's just trash".. I check the box. Looks good... open the box. BOOM! One pristine, perfect, heavenly cylinder of satisfaction. With the biggest grin on my face I think to myself, “IS THIS MY BIRTHDAY!? MY GOD HOW I’VE MISSED YOU SO MUCH." -- that's when I hear chris say, "ey daddy wahyoo doing?" I look at chris. I look at my treasure. I look at Chris. I look at the nicotine filled teat of Satan himself. I look at Chris. He says "cahcahava!" 
-- I proceed to crumble the box and cigarette and throw them in the nearest garbage.

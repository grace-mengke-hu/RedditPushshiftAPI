How pathetic?

So I'm on the end of day three. I live at home and my parents are gone on vacation. I have four days of being alone to smoke, since my boyfriend works out of town m-f. The cigarettes I had three days ago, I submerged them in pool water and threw them in the trash. 

 How pathetic am I, the first thing I think of is to go pull them out of the trash. Not only is that unsanitary, how bad would it be to smoke a cigarette that was submerged in salt pool water. What if I inhaled even more chemicals? How am I this addicted that I thought and actually opened the trash can lid. They are still in there and I haven't taken them out. I'm just so mad at myself right now. 

I am proud that I didn't smoke them, and that I didn't go to the gas station and buy more. Honestly my boyfriend who is probably the only person who pushes me to be better, has been the reason this time around that I haven't caved in. I'm starting to think smoking is really selfish and we cave into a selfish craving knowing it's not only going to affect us in the long run but our family and loved ones as well. Thanks for reading my rant.. I appreciate you guys a lot.

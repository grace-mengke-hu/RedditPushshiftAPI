yesterday i almost slipped

it seems to me the more confident i am that i "did it", the sneakier the beast lurks around the corner. yesterday i had a beer with a friend in the sun and good mother, this was the hardest moment since i stopped because i was too self-assured.

it is crucial to never let the guard down. every so often i read that people relapsed 1 month in, or after a couple of years.

for all the people who "made it" a long time ago: is there a point when you just disconnect your identity from smokes? or is it similar to detoxing alcoholics, who will never be "non-drinkers" but "drinkers who stay away" for the rest of their lives.

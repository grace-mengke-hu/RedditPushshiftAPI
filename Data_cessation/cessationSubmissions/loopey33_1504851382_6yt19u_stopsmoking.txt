Marijuana completely relieved me of nicotine withdrawal. Was high for a week straight and have been cigarette free for 5 months now.

I've tried everything to quit. Gum, patches, vapes. Nothing worked. I then acquired a medical marijuana card for like $40 and purchased some edibles at a nearby dispensary. The first day I took my edible I felt no withdrawals at all. It felt like am absolute miracle. I continued to be high for an entire week and afterward I felt completely relieved of my addiction. Once in a while though I'll get a slight urge but then I'll hit my marijuana vape to get rid of it. I've since been off of cigarettes for 5 months and have no urges anymore.

If it works for me I'm guessing it could work for others. Try it out if you feel like nothing else is working for you!

Motivation to complete much needed goals.

I've wanted to get back into shape for so long but didn't feel the slightest bit motivated since I was a pack a day smoker. The day I gave up I swore to myself I would start working out again and almost 2 months later I am in the best shape of my life!

Quitting smoking has enabled me to do so much more with my life. It just gives you so much self worth! Since quitting smoking I've stopped biting my nails (habit I've had since I was about 5 years old), I've completely cleaned up my diet, I'm training 6 days a week at the gym, I've lost 14 pounds of body fat and I feel the best I've felt since I can remember. On top of that I haven't touched a drip of alcohol either! Just wanted to say exercise and making healthy choices is a great way to counter your cravings! For anyone struggling, give it a try some time :)

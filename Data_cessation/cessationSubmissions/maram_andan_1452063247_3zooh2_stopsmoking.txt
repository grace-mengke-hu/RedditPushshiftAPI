6th day !

28 M. Was a Smoker  for the past 7 years and decided to take the plunge on insistence from my wife and my parents. Doesn't help when you are staying in Dubai and half the people around here smokes 
:(

Also, its been difficult, especially when I see my colleagues stepping out to smoke. 

The thing is, a good part of my daily schedule was worked around smoke breaks and I had literally had to rework the entire day schedule now :)

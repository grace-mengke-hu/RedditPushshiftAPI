Day 1: The Long Road Ahead

I've been smoking on an off for about two years, now, averaging about a pack a week. I know that's not a lot, but it's enough to realize that I have a problem. I don't want to go around smelling like smoke anymore or upsetting my family when I go smoke, so I think now I am truly going to quit. And that's why I subscribed here, because I think it's the best place for support outside of my family and friends. Of course, I do have friends who smoke, but I'll go strong and not give in when they take smoke breaks from band practice or something. What truly sparked this want to quit, other than the social stigma and feeling constantly unhealthy, is the fact that my genes are such that I am very prone to lung cancer, especially from smoking, and I want to live long enough to be a great-grandfather. I want to see the world and not be burdened by wheezing or coughing or smelling. I just want to enjoy life, now, and quitting smoking is the best thing I can do for myself to fully achieve that.

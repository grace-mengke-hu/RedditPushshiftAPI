New quite again

Hi I have never used a website like this before.  I'm a little concerned but quiting is the most difficult thing.   It actually one of the few things I have really tried my best to do over and over again and failed at every time.   I haven't smoked for a week but it is just about all I can think about.     I'm not sure I'm strong enough to do this.   I have been diagnosed with copd so it is very important that I quit but my self confidence is weak.

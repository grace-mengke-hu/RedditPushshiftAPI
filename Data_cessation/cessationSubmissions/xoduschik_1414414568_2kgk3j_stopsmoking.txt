6 days in...

First of all, thank you for letting me lurk and getting the courage I need to stop for good. I've been staying at my (non smoking) sister's house for the past week, but am a bit concerned when I go back to the 'real world' with my pack a day partner.

A couple of questions: is it fairly common to start having to frequently cough, like ALL THE TIME? I'm not producing anything. I keep telling myself that this is my lungs trying to clean themselves.

Also, any advice for when your partner shows no signs of stopping? How best to deal with temptation?

Thank you all!! :)

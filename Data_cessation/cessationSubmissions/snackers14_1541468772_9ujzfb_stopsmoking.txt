I don't want to stop smoking

Hey everyone. I love smoking. I'm also addicted to smoking. I was all about that #vapelife, and I was SUPER dependent on that. Like, really bad. Eventually I got to the point where I just thought it was really lame, so I seemed myself off and was able to quit, the withdrawal process was terrible. I quit for about a year, and now I'm back on smoking traditional smokes and have been for a year. 

I have been wanting to quit for a little while... Sort of. I love smoking. I really do and always have. I have stopped a couple times for a week at a time cold turkey just fine when visiting my family (they don't know I smoke) but when I'm back home I go back to it. I love smoking. 

So I know that the nicotine is playing into it a bit, but I don't think I'm straight up addicted. I think I just genuinely enjoy it more than anything. 

Has anybody had an experience similar to mine? Any ideas to find motivation to quit? Because like I said I really don't want to. I haven't had a smoke in 5 days as of this post, because I'm visiting my family. I don't want to say I'm craving a smoke right now, but I'm definitely looking forward to it.  Its tough man

Rectal bleeding after quitting for 6 months +

As the title suggests, has anyone had this experience due to quitting after six months to a year?

Edit: It is my fathers 'Doctor that had asked him if he had quit smoking in the past year as that can cause acute rectal bleeding which he has experienced recently. His tests for Colonoscopy came back negative for any type of cancers.

I found it strange that stopping smoking can cause such a thing.

I just told my mom that I'm addicted to marijuana

It's been 5 years since I started to smoke weed daily. I'm tired of being single. I'm really tired of been broke. I'm tired of my potheads friends. I'm tired  of everything that has to do with marijuana!. I'm 22 years old and I can't even remember the last time i had sex, is like Wtf? I'm not a model, but I'm a good looking guy with a 12k car that I bought my self. I'm a young entrepreneur with a lots of goals, but weed has taken all my motivation. In the notes, of my iphone, i have ideas since 2013 and I haven't done any of them. I own a photography business, work a part-time job and doing a BBA in marketing full time. If I put some of my marketing ideas to my photography business I know that I'm going to make enough money to quit my job. 

This is my 3rd day without smoking weed, I just had tell somebody about my addiction. I talk spanish, sorry for my bad english and thanks for the time!

Update

Hey guys, 
I made a post a while ago on my first day of quitting where I honestly felt like complete shit. I am now on day 24 and despite having a heavy workload and the occasional craving (more mental than physical) to go for a smoke, the intense cravings have passed. I used patches for my first week to ease into it and then just went cold turkey after that. I have also got back into the gym and hopefully that will keep giving me the extra motivation to avoid those sneaky cigs during the day. Have a great day guys and good luck!!

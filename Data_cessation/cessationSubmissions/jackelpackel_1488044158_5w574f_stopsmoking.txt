It's been 6 months

Yesterday marked my 6th month of not smoking. I can finally say that I am a non-smoker now. I've gone out to concerts and clubs. I've gotten drunk, and never reached or asked anyone for a cigarette. If I see someone smoke, I don't really crave it, but if I do smell it. I get really sick. I can't stand to be around it.

I started smoking around 13-14 years of age. I'm 31 next month.  What really made me want to quit smoking was the constant fear of getting lung cancer. The last year of smoking, I used to get smokers cough more and more frequently that was when that fear got stronger and stronger that I just quit smoking period. I used the patches for like 5-6 weeks and then suddenly quit.

Now that I quit. I can run for much longer times. I'm able to play with my dog without being so bloody tired. I don't smell of a 1Â½ - 2 packs a day smoker. Sadly, quitting didn't help with my snoring problem. LOL. But I can finally stopped being a mouth breather.

I used to could never see a life without cigarettes. 6 months later, I definitely can, and have no plans to ever start up again.

Day 1 again...

I quit on a whim last time. Four days was easy. Had a moment of pause when I was offered one, and took it. Started back up. Now its 11 days after then, and I'm out of money, again. So I've just made it through day 1, again, easy as fuck. 

Its wierd, I think part of me wants to quit, and part of me doesn't. Because at the same time that I'm making this post, 'quitting', and abstaining from tobacco, I know that once I get that paycheck come Friday, I'll be buying a pack ASAP. What a world.

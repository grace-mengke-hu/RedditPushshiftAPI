It's midday on Tuesday in NZ... Haven't had a smoke since 8pm lastnight.

Trying cold turkey this time, can't use champix because it messes with my dreams... and don't want to use patches because that way the body is still getting nicotine. 
Do the physical cravings get less intense after the three day mark? 

Because at the moment I feel like I am going insane! 

Any feedback appreciated :-)

Grip Master

Found a new way to quit.  Hope this will help someone else.....

I've tried countless times in the past three years to quit smoking.  Attempt after attempt always resulting in smoking again. 

Tried the gum.... that doesn't work. My throat hurts worse than smoking and I still want a cigarette.

Tried the patch... hmm this isn't so bad but why the hell does it inch so bad? 24 hrs later and look a rash.  I also want a cigarette right now .

E-cig... Out of the three attempts so far this one is the best.  I still get to enjoy my habit but I'm not smoking... three weeks later I'm smoking more cigs than I ever did before.

Well, I'm never quitting smoking.  Screw it.  But... Damn, I really like cigs.  This sucks.  But my pops did die from lung cancer.  Man, I need to quit. 

I decided I was actually quiting this time...

Well I'm tired and done for the night.  I'll finish this tomorrow.  In the meantime, please be as rude as possible and I'll be sure to help you tomorrow!!!

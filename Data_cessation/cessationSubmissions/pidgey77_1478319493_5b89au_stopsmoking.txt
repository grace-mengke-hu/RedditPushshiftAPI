2 months today...

It's been an experience for sure. I was not the most active smoker, usually only smoked on weekends when I drank a beer and stuff, but I did smoked a ton (at least a ton in my opinion, easily a pack in the weekend, maybe a bit more)

So I got tired with having a lot of moral and physical regret of doing this to myself. It was an internal battle to just go out to drink because drinking made me want to smoke. And I really like to have myself a beer or a drink because its relaxing, but it was always accompanied by a cigarrate, then two, then 10.

So I stayed home for a month, no alcohol. It was a little difficult because social gatherings are just, to me, a lot more relaxing with a drink. So I just had to buy a video game (mario galaxy 2 lol) and stayed at home, doing more excerse than usual (went to 6 days of the week 1 hour cardio instead of 5 days 50 minutes).

I finally went out and got semi drunk a month later. Was hard to say no to my friend that smokes, but he was glad for me. It's been a lot easier since then, I don't even feel anxiety anymore when i get a drink or to go out. I'm still cautious, taking it one step a day.

PEDIT: Just for more information. 28 years old. Have always been very active gym. Been smoking on "social gatherings" since 18. Smoked a lot more in college due to roommates doing it all the time. Happy with not smelling like smoke on sunday and saturday mornings.

It stops being cool before its too hard to drop.

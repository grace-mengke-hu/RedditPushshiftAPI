476 days but I'm dying for a cigarette lately

I quit smoking last year as a result of a health scare (that ultimately had nothing to do with smoking and is now 100% fine). I smoked from ages 16-24 and didn't really know what it was like to not smoke. Long story short, it's awesome. Not smoking has improved my life x 1 million. Quitting sucked and I never want to do it again but it was worth it

Having said all that, in the last two weeks I have been absolutely fucking dying for a cigarette or 20. I'm neck deep in essay season for my postgrad degree, stressed out of my mind, coping with panic attacks and stress eating, both of which lend themselves to stress puking, constantly. I just want a smoke.

The thing is, I know one cigarette won't be enough and that quitting again would be fucking awful and I'd hate myself for breaking. I just wanna hear from other people who've felt the same way and know that you got through it.

TLDR; 476 days later I still crave a smoke when I'm stressed. Please lend some support.

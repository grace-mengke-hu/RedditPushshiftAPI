100 days!

I made it 100 days! I never thought I'd make it this far. This is my first quit attempt. I hope it sticks. I will admit it is still hard for me, actually a little harder now than it was in the beginning. Not like I'm going to actually smoke, but I throw a mental temper tantrum, and still get those urges to smoke, especially after I eat. Oh well though, hopefully it"ll get easier. I would've never even quit if it wasn't for this sub! Thanks guys!

Rollercoaster brains

I’m into day 4. I’ve quit before, I know this shit is hard work. I know I increased my nicotine amounts this year, after my children’s father died. 
Anyway... This time, the quit is so strange. My body feels jumpy, like I’m on a roller coaster constantly getting to the “free fall” guy feeling, only it’s all over my body. I’m so spaced out that I can not drive. I’m to nauseous to eat. I haven’t slept for more than 1hr at a time, in 3 days. I’m already coughing up crap. 
Not sure what all is happening, but it’s terrifying and I belong in a padded room with sedation. 

Is it normal
To have such extreme neurological side affects causing so much physical weirdness?

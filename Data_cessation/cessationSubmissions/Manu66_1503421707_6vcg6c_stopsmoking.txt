1 month and 1 week smoke free

Today I mark my 36th day without cigarettes and the funny thing is: I actually didn't suffer at all. The whole process was absolutely painless and easy.

If anyone would have told me that just 6 weeks ago I'd have laughed at them.

But the truth is: once you get into the right mindset, it's actually pretty easy. Don't rely on willpower, it simply doesn't work. Why? Because every time you exert willpower you have less for the next time, until you eventually mentally give up.

The trick is to put things on autopilot, so that you don't have to think about it. 

* GENUINELY convince yourself that you don't need a toxic poison in your body.
* Change your habits around food, social occasions, etc a little bit. Environmental cues are what trigger withdrawal pangs. Your body is actually nicotine-free after 48 hours.
* Look at other smokers and don't envy them but pity them. Keep repeating at yourself that you are a NON-SMOKER.

**Life is too short to shorten it on purpose.**

To all the people who have just started: **YOU CAN DO IT**.

Good luck everybody :)

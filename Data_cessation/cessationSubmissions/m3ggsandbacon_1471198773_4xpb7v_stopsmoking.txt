Finding that the mental aspect is much harder than the physical

I am on day 6 of being smoke free! The first 3 days I had a really foggy head and some headaches, but it really wasn't that bad. However, starting last night, the mental craving for a smoke has been bad and carried on in to today. I am finding it harder to deal with the mental aspect of the quit. I ordered Allen carrs book because anything that could help is a bonus. Anyone else having a similar experience? Any advice? Thanks and congrats to all of you on your quit!

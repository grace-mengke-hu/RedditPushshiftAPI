Day Zero Sucks. More so when it's the 3rd time. Anyone try Chantix?

I used to wonder why those who quit spoke of it's difficulty.  This is the 3rd time I'm "quitting".  I'm seriously thinking about taking Chantix, but I've heard some scary stories and wanted to know if anyone on reddit had taken it and what your experience was.  What all does it affect?  Did it make home matters worse, or ruin other things for you?  

The part that sucks is not smoking when alcohol and smoking friends are around.  Maybe it's just me, (maybe I was that guy at one point) but does it seem that smokers are really forceful about bumming a cigarette to a non smoker/recent quitter?  

At t he end of the day I get to see my badge of 937 days reduced to less than 5.  

***Edit: I just wanted to say thank you to all who have commented.  I'm back online and reading thru your submissions.  I think I'm going to talk to my doc about Chantix now.  Even those of you who seem to have issues are all saying the same thing at the end of the day... "It was worth it."  

Again... Thank you and as always, good luck in staying a quitter.

21 days when I wake up

It was my first nicotine free day today. I was using an ecig up until yesterday but haven't touched it today. I bought a new device and decided it was too much hassle so did without. It wasn't too bad and I think I can cope without it. I'm dropping my partner off at work in the morning, then treating myself to breakfast somewhere to celebrate.

130 days, and relapsing hard.

It's mental, emotional, stress, cyclic.  Suddenly I have already smoked a pack and a half. I'm relapsing in other areas of my life too. Addictive personality, bad habits dieing hard. 

Can't let it hold me down. Gotta have the strength to throw them out and swear them off before I get completely hooked again. Wish I never picked them up ever, I don't understand why they are so comforting when I'm stressed out.

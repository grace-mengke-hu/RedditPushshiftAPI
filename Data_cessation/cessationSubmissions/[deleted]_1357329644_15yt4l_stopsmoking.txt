Today is my fourth day without cigarettes and I'm driving myself insane.

My boyfriend and I both have quit smoking for the new year. I'm on day 4 without smoking, cold turkey. He's on day 3.5, with patches. I seem to be having a MUCH harder time even though I smoked significantly less (4-5 a day compared to his 15-20). Today especially I feel like I'm losing my mind. I can't control my mood swings, I feel like I can cry at the drop of a dime and it's all really putting a strain on the way he and I are interacting (no one wants to deal with a nutcase). How can I get past this point? Are there any tricks or tips that any of you may have? Any help or advice would be appreciated.

Day 1- DUN DUN DUN!!!

Today is day 1!! Including sleep, it's been 12 hours. Without sleep, it's been 4 hours. So far I'm ok. My leg is bouncing all over the place, but I'm calmly overcoming the cravings so far. I'm surprised that I feel this good(for now), and also that I feel this strong! I know can do this!!

I’m going to try and quit

I’m coming to terms that I’m an addict. It’s painful and somewhat embarrassing to think how much it addicted to a stupid usb drive (juul). I’m 16 and have been vaping everyday for the past year. But tomorrow im going to go cold turkey with it.

I’m glad I found this subreddit and am nervous about becoming sober

Milestone treats?

My go to treat for anything (bad day at work, passing an exam, good work out session) is always, always food. So I'm trying to think of milestone treats that don't cost the earth that are not food related (I'm trying to lose weight whilst quitting). I've gone 3 weeks and have saved over Â£120, which I wouldn't want to spend, but can't think of anything I wouldn't normally get myself that I could class as a treat and something to look forward to. What are your milestone treats?

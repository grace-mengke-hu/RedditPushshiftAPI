I'm finally reading Allen Carr's Stop Smoking Now and rejoined this subreddit. I'm getting closer!

I joined this subreddit before but after the fire left me, all the posts that would show up on my feed just depressed me ... but here I am again.  I'm actually getting excited now.  Anyone else in a similar boat as me?  Need a buddy?

Only 25 days without smoking and my life has already improved A LOT

The only hard days were the first ones. Now, if a friend smokes in front of me I don't get anxious anymore (I actually feel sorry for them).

My stamina in the gym has skyrocketed, I don't have financial problems anymore, my hair grows faster, brighter and stronger, and my sex life is amazing again. I feel super healthy and I got into really good habits since I quit (working out, going for walks, drinking green tea...).

Keep on everybody! This subreddit has helped me a lot, as well as the Smoke Free app. I thank you all for sharing your experiences and feelings, that's very motivational.

Some tips for the ones who are struggling or who recently quit:

- GET RID of all your lighters and ashtrays. Those are potential triggers for relapsing.

- Drink a lot of water. It will ease your cravings. Besides, tobacco is a dehydrater and getting into the habit of keeping your body well hydrated is essential. It will also improve your mood, your health and your damaged skin.

- Keep yourself busy. Go to the gym, get important business done.

- Eat healthy snacks. Also, 5-6 healthy, well-balanced meals a day is better than 2-3 feasts. Remember that having a very full stomach can also trigger the cravings for a cigarette. If you don't feel 100% full with your light meal, drink water or a cup of tea.

- Think about all the money you're saving and treat yourself with nice things you like. Smoking eventually equals to bankruptcy. If you quit, your wallet will thank you.

- Read about all the hideous diseases and conditions caused by tobacco (yellow teeth, hair loss, bad breath, stroke, erectile dysfunction, COPD, all cancers, infertility, IQ reduction, neuronal death, insomnia, shortness of breath, slower muscle build, dehydration, skin damage, premature aging...).


Smoking is POINTLESS.

Be strong!

Best wishes.

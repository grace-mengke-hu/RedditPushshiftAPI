Is this a good idea?

Lurker here. Coming up on 10 years of being a smoker. Ive been trying (not really) to quit for the last few months. I have a rx for Chantix. I went through the first month pack but hadn't quit yet (consistency in taking them was not there) then there was an issue with the pharmacy and it took over a week to get the next pack. I have it but haven't started taking it again. The other night I took all of the pills out of the blister pack because I have all the little tabs all over the place in my bedroom. It dawned on me afterwards that it was a dumb move bc I'm getting on an airplane Tuesday and now the pills are all in a ziplock bag. I'm going to a conference for work at sea world. My plan now is to skip the Chantix. Just use the change in location and routine to force me to cold turkey it. I won't have transportation and I assume Marlborough lights aren't a gift shop option. Also my family will be far away and not have to deal with me if I turn into a psychopath. Is this a good idea? I come home Saturday and will start taking the Chantix as soon as I get in the car to try to prevent a relapse (my SO is a smoker too so the temptation will be there once I get home). I also have carrs book which I want to read while I'm there. I really need to do this. I want to try to get pregnant soon and I don't want to wait until then to quit. I want to be as healthy as I can for my future baby. I want to buy a bigger house. I am spending $20 a DAY on cigarettes. (2ppd)
Thanks for reading. I appreciate any thoughts.

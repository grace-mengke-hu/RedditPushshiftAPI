6 days and going strong

Hi all, I've been lurking around here looking for motivation to stop. I finally hit a point last week where my bank account read back 0.80 to me and I decided it was the right time. It's been a hell of a week but I just wanted to say thank you to this sub for helping me find inspiration in my journey to a healthier life and that I am looking forward to engaging more as the temptation continues in my stressful life. <3

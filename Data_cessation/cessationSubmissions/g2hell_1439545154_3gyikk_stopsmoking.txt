First Week 2nd Time

I have quit smoking a thousand times and Stopped reading the ill effects of smoking..

But this time I really want to quit for the sake of my future and my kids and family... 

I have been smoking for 20 years now - Not too many a day - just 3 to 4 average per day - but sufficient enough to keep me hooked and spoil my throat (i am also a singer)

Aout 6 to 8 months back, I had quit smoking for nearly 8 weekss, before I started that 1 cig and gradually slipped back to my regular schedule. I found my second and third week the toughest time periods after stopping smoking. I found this sub before I had tried quitting, but never subscribed... 

This time,  I am hitting my second week tomorrow and looking for encouragement and support from this community - Please support in my effort to come clean.

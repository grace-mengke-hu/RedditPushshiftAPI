I've been "craving" all day

I finally read Allen Carr's book, thanks to a swanky redditor who uploaded the PDF. I loved it.

A week later I was smoking again but... I knew it was because I hadn't understood it in it's totality.

So I bought the audio book to have with me on my phone. Duncan Wells crushes it. It really helped me understand the sillyness of cigarettes, perpetuating the nicotine addiction just so I can... pretend to enjoy it, or whatever.

Ten days ago, I decided that was it. I woke up and decided that was it. This is it. And it was. Until the weekend.

Last weekend I was crawling out of my skin by nighttime. I had... all this not-lethargy to get rid of but I was so used to never doing anything or just going out to the bar. Thankfully I kept hanging on to "well, are you going to smoke forever? because if you smoke again you might as well smoke forever because that's how this has been going. *So do not doubt your decision to stop*." I went to bed eventually and had a busy Sunday and didn't think of it. The work week was fine.

Until today. It's fuckin FRIDAY man. FRIDAY DUDE get a hotdog fuck a beer drink a cigarette LET'S DO IT. And I'm having one of those classic Allen Carr whirlpools - I think about cigarettes, I realize I don't smoke them, but I sort of want it, but I "can't" have it, so I get upset, so what do I do when I'm upset? I smoke a cigarette, but I can't... etc etc.

I get all worked up and can't calm down. I still haven't smoked but damnit. I'm trying to avoid using "willpower" to "force" myself to not smoke, but damnit, there is one benefit of being a smoker:

It's an excuse to be a lazy son of a bitch, and sometimes I get into that mood where that's what I want. I want to not feel good and not do anything.

I keep getting this urge to go "relieve" myself, and I know I can't. That's how I feel.

Alright, damnit, here I go.

Smoker for 14 years.  Between 1/2 and a pack a day, depending on the day.  Im sick of being overweight.  Im sick of not being able to breathe.  Im sick of stinking like a bar when Im with my wife and kiddos.  Started running a few weeks ago and the cigs gotta go.  Im probably going to be a major asshole for the next couple of days, but Im sick of being addicted to these damn things.  Wish me luck.

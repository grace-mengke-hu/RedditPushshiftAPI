[25] F complete emotional wreck from having quit cigarettes after 9 years of smoking. DAY 3

It’s day 3 and I definitely have a ton of anxiety and irritability. I feel depressed. I will also cry at whatever makes me feel bad lol. 

I’m feeling crazy. Just a huge mess.  

When I was younger like 13-17 I was diagnosed with depression and would indulge in self harm. I attribute that a lot to the fact that I was a hormonal teenage girl and it was just a phase I would grow out. And I did. I truly became a happier person inside and out.

But what’s so weird to me is that after all these years of smoking and suddenly quitting, my mind is kinda pushing and reminding me of my old addiction (the self harm) it’s kinda like my minds trying to trick itself to get addicted to something again. I guess I have an addictive personality? Or is it just the nicotine addiction ?

Anyways, has anyone else dealt with depression or crazy thoughts after quitting smoking? I feel wild.

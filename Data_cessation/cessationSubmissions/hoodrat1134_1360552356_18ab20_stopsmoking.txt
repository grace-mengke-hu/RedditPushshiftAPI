Cognitive benefits of quitting?

Obviously, the main point of media that encourages cessation from tobacco use focuses heavily on the respiratory system and the vascular system. I'm more interested in the cognitive effects of smoking cessation (both short and long term). This includes anything from memory to reasoning to learning ability differences. Do any of you have links to studies or articles about such effects, or even just personal observations that you'd like to share?

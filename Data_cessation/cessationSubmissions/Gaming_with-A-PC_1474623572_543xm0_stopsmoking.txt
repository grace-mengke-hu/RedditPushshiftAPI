Starting Zyban, what are your experiences?

I picked up Zyban from the doc today, sort of on a whim. I understand it's supposed to get me to stop smoking, but I'm conflicted about stopping. I know there are no benefits to continue but I'm getting massive waves of anxiety and am smoking as I type. Anyone use it to stop and what are your experiences/tips?

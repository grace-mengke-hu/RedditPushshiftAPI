I need advice on helping my father quit smoking.

Alright everyone. I need your help. My father has smoked for about 40 years. He is 55 now and has a horrible cough; an abnormal cough. He has one of the do-it-yourself machines and rolls his own. He most likely will not read anything, so I need something even more digestible. It's amazing that he still is here honestly, given how long he's been at it. The best thing I have thought of is for him to lower his amount until he is at zero, then sale his machine. I know that is a hell of a lot easier said, than done. Any resources and advice is much appreciated.Thank you guys.

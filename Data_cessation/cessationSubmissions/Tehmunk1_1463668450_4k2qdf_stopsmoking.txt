Need to quit

I've been smoking for the majority of the last decade. There's probably been a good year I haven't smoked in this time. Every day I try to talk myself out of buying a pack and I end up going after an hour to finally get it. I quit drinking over 2 years ago and that was tough (definitely alcohlic) but I cannot shake this. I've tried patches and gum but immediately give in once I see someone else smoking. 

I'm about to turn 30 and don't want this to be part of my life. I work out, can easily run 3+ miles (grew up playing soccer so I've always been able to run). I just met an awesome girl and I'm ashamed that I smoke. I don't want to quit for her, I need to do this for myself. Overall I think I'm pretty healthy, but I've been starting to wheeze after a smoke, constantly coughing.

About 3 times a week I'll go 24 hours without smoking, but I always give in. Looking for advice...or whatever. I don't want to be known as a smoker anymore

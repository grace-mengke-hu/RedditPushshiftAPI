Day 8. I hate quitting.

I'm lost.  I've tried quitting a few times and got as long as 6 months, but I really miss smoking.  Not so much the nicotine or standing in the cold, but the time.  It was me time even if I was out with "the smoking club".  In the car, waiting for dogs.  This isn't a poor me post.  We're all going through it.  

I am grateful for the stopped wheezing, the control over what I'm doing.  Just right now for the past few days the loss has been greater than I've felt and nothing seems to be filling the void.  Not video games, eating, the gym, books.  Vacation is almost over and I NEED to get over this hump.

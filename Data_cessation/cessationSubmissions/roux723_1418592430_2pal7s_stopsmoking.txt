What to do when the SO is still smoking??

I started dating someone over the summer and we were both smokers. We broke up and both "quit" but his version of quitting is the "I only smoke when I drink" quit. We got back together and it's going very well but when we're having a few drinks and he pops out for a cigarette I get the strongest cravings and I'm worried I'll cave and start the "I only smoke when I drink" thing, which for me always leads right back to being a full-time smoker within a few weeks. Help!! I want him to quit for good too but know that that's something that will need to happen in his own time...and I don't want to have to avoid being around him in social situations where he might be smoking. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Holiday Stress

Hey y'all I'm a college student from a pretty shitty family background. Holidays are normally hard for me, and this year I spent Thanksgiving with a painfully normal, functional family. I've been struggling with a deep, deep depressive spiral for a few months and quit vaping about a month ago. So after two days with my friend's family I had a breakdown (long other story) and I went out to get some sort of nicotine source and totally forgot that NJ has the stupid 21 law for nicotine. Idk I feel like I need nicotine or even just an excuse to hang out by myself outside and not talk to anyone. Any advice at all or like how to get away from instinctively feeling that need for nicotine in stressful situations?

Anyone in a better mood lately?

I'm about a week in. I didn't really plan for this but a few things kind of lined themselves up to make it more conducive and I've been thinking about it for a while.  But besides not stinking and coughing and all that it feels like I'm more tolerant or something.  Perhaps it is due to better self esteem.  What do you think?

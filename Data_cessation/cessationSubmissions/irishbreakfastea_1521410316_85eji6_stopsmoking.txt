My last pack of cigarettes

I joined this forum a few months ago, and I successfully quit smoking for 8 days then I relapsed.  I have now been a smoker again for 2 months but I am ready to quit again.  I realized nothing happens if I don't try, and the last time I tried I went over a week.  I am still trying to decide if I should use nicotine gum or not, I have it available.   I know there are differing opinions on the gum but to me I want to do whatever helps.  I have bronchitis right now and it's becoming increasingly harder to breathe.  I just wanted to say hi to all of you, and put the word out that in the coming days I will quit again.  I know I can do this, I just want some support.  You guys gave me some excellent advice last time. I'll keep you updated!

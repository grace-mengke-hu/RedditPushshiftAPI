Just a Reminder

I've been going strong for nearly three months now and the cravings have, for the most part, stopped. The reason I say "for the most part" is because I'm dealing with some stress right now and my brain is saying "hey dude a cigarette would help with that, why not smoke, just buy a pack, smoke one, and throw the rest out, just do it, just do it." 

On the whole, dealing with this has gotten way easier, but it's important for me to remember that quitting cigarettes is a lifetime commitment. I can handle the cravings much better now that I'm a few months in, but the triggers will always be there. I'm learning this. 

Whoo, even writing that out has made me want to smoke less. Niceeeee.

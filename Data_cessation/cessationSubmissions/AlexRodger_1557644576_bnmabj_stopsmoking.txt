i want to quit but

hi reddit

 I'm a smoker for 5 years now and I'm on my 5th attempt to quit it. 
 I thought everyone is like me until i googled it and i found 0 results. i have a sudden, strong and weird urge to smoke every time i brush my teeth even if i just smoked before i brush them. the urge last for hours and it's stronger then the normal smoking carving and it also causes me to slip.
anyone here is like me or it's just me and what you suggest? 
ps: you may as well make fun of it lol.

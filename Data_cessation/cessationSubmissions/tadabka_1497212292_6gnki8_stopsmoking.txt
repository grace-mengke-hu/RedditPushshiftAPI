1 Year today!! Woke up excited:p

This is my first post, but today is the day I share my experience.But first I want to thank this community for giving valuable information on how to quit that nasty "disease".The insight that is provided helped big time on my quit! Its already been 365 days and honestly its hard for me to believe that I even had a smoking addiction! I went cold turkey and overcame terrible physical symptoms.It felt like torture. But I knew they would leave, and they did. Then I focused mentally and I unlocked the secret to staying quit. No Nicotine ever from anything at all no matter what. And everytime I craved I recognized it as an attempt by the drug to trick me into having it again. It helped me big time in preventing a relapse. I also realize cravings come once in awhile still, but I have the tools to cut them down. Good luck everyone at there quit! You will succeed!! I did:p

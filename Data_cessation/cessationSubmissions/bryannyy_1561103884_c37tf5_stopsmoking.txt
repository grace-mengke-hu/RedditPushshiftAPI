Haven't touched a cigarette for 3 months now

I'm 20 this year and have been smoking since I was 18. Really affected my health and decided to stop when it messed with my voice. 
Took a while with me constantly lying to myself about having my last stick. This sub has definitely gave me the motivation to quit and now I have been nicotine free for 3 months now. 
I've even lost the cravings to having a cigarette :)

Thanks everyone

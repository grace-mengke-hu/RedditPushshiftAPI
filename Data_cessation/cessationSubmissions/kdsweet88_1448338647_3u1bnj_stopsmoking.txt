Day 3, and I'm depressed and tired.

Work was awful.  Everything is awful.  I just want to sleep and cry and cuddle my fiance.  I know this is normal, but I see why people relapse.  Right now, even though I know it's not true, I feel like I'm in mourning.  Like I've lost something.  I've had no energy at all since I quit, and I just feel like a trainwreck.  I think it's because I had smoking linked with everything in my life; eating, watching tv, talking on the phone, before work, work breaks, after work....everything.  So now I'm lost.  I don't know what to do with myself anymore.

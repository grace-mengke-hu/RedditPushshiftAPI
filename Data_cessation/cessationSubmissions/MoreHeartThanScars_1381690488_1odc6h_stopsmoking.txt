A little late, but this is my belated one month celebration.

I'm two days late but I just hit the one month mark on the 11th of this month. I feel absolutely phenomenal, and I couldn't be happier with my decision to quit. I went through with some struggles in the first two weeks, but after that I feel like I can defeat this addiction. 

If you've taken time to read this, thank you. If you're thinking about quitting or struggling to keep up your streak, just know that it is absolutely worth the physical and mental struggle, its just a temporary pain that you CAN overcome. 

I would also like to thank the other users that provided encouraging and inspirational words to keep me going. Thank you so much.

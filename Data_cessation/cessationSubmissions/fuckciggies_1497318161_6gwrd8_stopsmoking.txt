Advice on 'timing' from people who have read Allen carrs easy way? Pretty please help!

So I've almost finished the book, and it's been so insightful. I really have been questioning each cigarette since I began the book, and each time I have a cigarette im subconsciously repeating notions from the book to myself, such as the fact that I only need this cigarette because it's satiating the withdrawals from the last, and all it's going to do is cause me to crave another!
So I really feel most parts of the book have clicked for me.
One part I'm concerned for though, is timing. 
This weekend I have a house party at a friends, they are generally all night parties, drug fueled, with indoor smoking. The next day another friend is putting on an event, with the main music area being where smoking is allowed. 
I feel like if I put the quit off til after the weekend, it means that the advice hasn't truly hit home, as I am essentially still 'fearful' of quitting. However, I almost feel as it will be impossible to be at the party without giving in, the air will be full of nicotine, I'll probably be drunk and potentially intoxicated on other substances that may lower my inhibition, and around all my friends who are also heavy smokers. I understand that the books advice is that I should pity them but that seems REALLY tough in those circumstances. I also don't want to not go the party, because that also contradicts the books message of I'm not giving up any enjoyable aspects of my life. 
With this in mind, do you think that the book hasn't clicked for me? Or is this a reasonable "timing" limitation?
Any advice would be amazing. Thank you so much ðŸ’œ

Today I have quit, once and for all.

I have tried before but I was not ready, today I am ready. I had my last cigarette last night and I no longer want to smoke. I look to the future and no longer imagine myself with a cigarette in hand. I have bought mint strips containing nicotine to help me on my journey and so far so good. I thought working (in a kitchen) would be the hardest part. It probably is so far but I have got through today and not smoked and i am so proud of myself and I am proud of my new future. Id also like my flair reset haha

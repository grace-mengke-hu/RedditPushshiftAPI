Oh God, guys help

Today is it guys, I've been awake for 2 hours and it sucks.
smoked ~10-15 cigs a day for the last 3 years.
I think I can do it, but my two roommates are both smokers and so that'll be interesting.
Right now I'm just cold turkeying it, any quitters out there have tips?
does the patch work? 
i may be panicking right now, this is terrifying.

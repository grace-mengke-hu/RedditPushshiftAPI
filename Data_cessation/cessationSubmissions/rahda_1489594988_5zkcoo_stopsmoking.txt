Obsessive for hourrrrs

I am doing a lot of things to kick this habit. I haven't had a cigarette in over two weeks. I don't actually want a cigarette if I follow the thoughts through. But I literally can think of nothing else but smoking or other issues in my life in combination with the urge to smoke for hours on end sometimes
 Ugh! It is making it so hard to function. I have vitamins, minerals, nutrition, hydration, starting a little more exercise, doing research, distracting, energy work, meditationsetc. I quit cold turkey and it was so hard initially, but I almost find this harder than the first few days. Venting and curious of others experiences. Will this end soon?! Thanks!

I hope it was the last one.

Once more I resolve to quit smoking. I need to quit smoking. I have tried and failed so many times. 

I have grown so much in the past two years. Sobriety was not easy but I managed it. This is the next step towards becoming the man I want to be. 

I am so tired of giving power to substances and habits. Tomorrow I will have zero cigarettes. Tomorrow I will worry about the day after tomorrow. Tomorrow will be a good day.

Thank you for giving me a place to get this off my chest.

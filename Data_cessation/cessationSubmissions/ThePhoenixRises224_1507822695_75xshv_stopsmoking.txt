My First Day as a Non-Smoker

My first day without cigarettes and without a single regret.

This time quitting, I **know** I am now a non-smoker. There was nothing to sacrifice, nothing to give up, only everything to gain. 

The chain of nicotine addiction has been broken. The withdrawals are nothing but the dying gasps of a poisonous master. 

I am free.

Cheers everyone!

3 days STRONG, where do I find an iOS app to display days and $ saved, etc?

3 days STRONG!!!!!  Where do I find an iOS app to display days quit and $ saved, etc?  I'm proud and also think it's a great incentive.

(I quit cold turkey,  and NO URGES since I quit.  Weird...  Other times I attempted to quit I had a backup for nicotine (patch, vape, hidden butts, etc).  This Time I just woke up  a nonsmoker and never want another one, and haven't had any remorse nor symptoms of withdrawal.  Wish me luck.

[I popped my cherry here 7 days ago posting to ask for help](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/6ufeyp/seriously_need_help_my_health_is_at_risk_and_it/) and got some great advice.  I let it all simmer for 4 days with tons of guilt AND WOKE Wednesday being a nonsmoker - 3 days now!  With way more resolve than the last times.  

AND SUPRISINGLY, WITH NO URGES TO CHEAT. I don't get it, but maybe at 62  and smoking 47 years, and after so many attempts and my health not so good now I realize it's time.  I said "FUCK YOU" out loud and gave my old ashtray the finger while i tossed it in the trash.

What can I expect in the days ahead??

Link me to the smoke free counter app please, thanks

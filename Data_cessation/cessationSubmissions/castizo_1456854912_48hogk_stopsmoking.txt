All right, let's see how this quitting smoking thing goes

I have been smoking for 9 years and just decided this morning to quit. I tried to go for a run yesterday and lasted about 30 seconds before I almost died, which was motivation for quitting this morning. Luckily I had some patches so I slapped one of those on after a shower. 

On my way to work, I stopped by a gas station and bought a disposable e-cig with no nicotine to help with my drive to work because every single time I'm in the car I light up. To be honest, with the patch and a e-cig, I might be able to make it much longer than I expected, which was 30 minutes. 

Till next time everyone!

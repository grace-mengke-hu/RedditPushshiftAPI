On my way.

For 18 years, every christmas and birthday my mom asks me to quit as her present. To be honest, I never seriously considered it until recently. But 2 years ago she moved out of state, so I only see her a couple times a year. A few weeks back, I booked a flight to see her for her birthday, then I realized she's picking me up and I'm staying at her house. There's no opportunity to sneak away without her knowing, and every smoke in front of her feels like a failure. 

I decided the fewer the better, I bought my last pack on the 16th and challenged myself to see how few I could smoke each day by vaping. After a few days of 2 or 3, I tried spitless nicotine pouches and that took away the cravings and my vape handled the fidgeting and need to occupy a break. I've had 2 left in that pack since last Tuesday. I made the trip and gave her a smoke free birthday. I started 6 mg juice and pouches and I'm already finding them excessive. Went to 3mg zyn and will taper my juice when I run out. If things keep going like they have, I can tell her I'm nicotine free for Christmas.

14 days. Feels awesome.

I wanted to wait until I made two weeks to announce to anyone that I stopped. Today when I woke up I made 14 days. It feels awesome. I smoked for 12 years(heavy for 7), and couldn't imagine what life would be like without joes. For two weeks I haven't had one. Not one. Ha! Take that me. Sun flower seeds have helped a lot, and a smoke free app.

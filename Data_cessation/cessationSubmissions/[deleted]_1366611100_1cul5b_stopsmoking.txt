Decided today to quit smoking, could use some help.

Hey, so I'm 19, I've been smoking (quite a bit I might add) for the past year or so. The main reason I've been doing it was to help with stress, but I'm finding now that lately I've been more stressed than ever and I'd like to quit. Any tips to help me curb the cravings and alternate methods of relieving stress would be very welcome. I want to stick with this, I'm just not sure if I'll be able to or not without some support. Thanks.

Should I buy skyrim?

Hey! I play World Of Warcraft and I'm looking for something fun to play while waiting for the next expansion.. My friend plays this game and it sounds pretty cool. I heard that you can like make yourself a healing damage dealer. That you can basically make a choice with attributes or something. Anyone want to give me some info on skyrim?

1 week today

I've quit a bunch, sometimes for a week, sometimes for months. The longest I ever quit was for 6 months. 

I end up drinking with friends (ALL of my friends smoke, so even when I don't have any they always offer) and then having one or a few.. Then that happens again, then I buy a pack and it's downhill. 

Last night I had some friends over to drink and try out VR. All night I was thinking I wanted a cig but I somehow stuck to my guns. This is the first time in over a year I didn't crack for "just one". I mentally want this time to be the final time and I think that's the trick. 

P. S. New to this sub, but figured a little reddit encouragement couldn't hurt (:

What about Nicotine replacement therapy?

It is very helpful with cravings! Also it doubles up the chances of quitting by providing you the nicotine you used to get. It is well-studied and safe ! Its not something would leave stigma, its like caffeine in coffee.. also , why not accepting something with benefits? We used to intoxicate our bodies with thousands of toxins and afraid to take a drug to quit safely and keep abstinence?

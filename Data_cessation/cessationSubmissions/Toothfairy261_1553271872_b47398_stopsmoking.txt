Well...

It's been 16 days cigarette free. When I quit, I told my boyfriend no more smoking in the house. Hes respected that, and as much as he hates to admit it, his smoking has decreased too. I dont think he enjoys being outside in the cold. I love that its saving money, and the house doesnt stink anymore. Yesterday, he said "you've been doing pretty well, I havent seen you smoke a single cigarette." It was almost like he was implying that I did it when he wasnt around. I said "well, that's because I havent smoked at all." He seemed so surprised, but it was a proud moment for me.

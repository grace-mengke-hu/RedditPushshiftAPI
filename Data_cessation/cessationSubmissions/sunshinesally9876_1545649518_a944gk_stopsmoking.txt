First Christmas Eve without smokes ðŸ˜Š

This has been the first Christmas Eve without smoking and the fact that I have been chilling since 9.30 pm, after a full day entertaining and a little drinking is a miracle!! Generally I would not get to bed before midnight, because I would have to have everything organised, clean and tidy!! So all that is still done but the time saved on not smoking means I can relax before bed and a big Christmas Day tomorrow!! Definitely another benefit to quitting ðŸ˜Š

Merry Christmas

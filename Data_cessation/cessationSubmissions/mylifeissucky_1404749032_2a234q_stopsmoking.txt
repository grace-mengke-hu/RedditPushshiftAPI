Neither could I believe how my legs felt so good walking today

I went to the c-store down the lane and my legs didn't hurt like fuck like they did a day or so ago. I couldn't feel my legs hurt. Maybe blood vessels opened up and fed the leg muscles like I never thought possible. I quit smoking a couple days ago.

I rode my bike today and wasn't out of breath!

Day 3 of no smoking. I woke up this morning and I wasn't stuffed up and gasping for air. I rode my bike to work and had a much easier time then on Friday. my heart wasn't pounding and my lungs don't hurt. it's amazing to see that little bit of progress. even though I'm in withdrawal and still having cravings, I need to focus on the positive reasons for doing this. today, I am happy that I'm a non smoker and I'm proud of my progress. I'm so pleased with the little bit of progress I've made. have a good day everybody!

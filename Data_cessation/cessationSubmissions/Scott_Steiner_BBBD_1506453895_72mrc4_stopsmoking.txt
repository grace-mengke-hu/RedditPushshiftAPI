I'm I doing this right?

So I'm at nearly two weeks since I had my last cigarette.  Was a pack a day smoker for about 10+ years and I'm a bit concerned.  I've always heard stories that quitting was "harder than quitting heroine" and that the cravings would be insane and I would feel horrible but in all honesty the cravings have been few and far between and not bad at all.  I quit cold turkey and I've substituted cravings with drinking water.  I also noticed at the beginning was binge eating more but now that seems to be over. 

what I am dealing with now is a nagging cough and a stuffed nose/sneezing which I read happens when you quit sometimes.  I guess my major concern is should it feel this easy to quit? do some people have an easier time at it then others? I've tried quitting in the past but it never stuck.  never went longer than a day or two but now this really feels like it's real deal and thus far it's a bit of a cake walk.

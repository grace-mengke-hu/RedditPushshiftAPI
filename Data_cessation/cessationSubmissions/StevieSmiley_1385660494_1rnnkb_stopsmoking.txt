40 days and 40 nights & Happy Thanksgiving.

Just happy I have quit and can smell things again. Which reminds me of yesterday, when I went for a jog,  ( well, if you call .3 of a mile x 4 a jog ) I noticed that a bunch of kids in a field makes the grass smell pretty potently . There is also a bush that was highly fragrant. and the smell stuck to my fingers. I dont think I remember these things  things even when I was young. Are smells amplified simply being aware of them and/or not having smelled them in so long? Even a stinky exhaust seems to put my nose in a shock lately.

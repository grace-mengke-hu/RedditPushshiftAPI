Effects of withdrawal after two weeks

I quit two weeks ago. I wasn’t a big smoker though. I smoked for 4 years, approximately 6 cigarettes a day.

I didn’t experience much withdrawal symptoms on the first week cause I had the flu therefore I was miserable already and I always hate cigarettes when I’m sick.

On the second week, my mom was staying with me and I never crave much when she’s around. Anyway it was going great and I was totally forgetting about cigarettes. 

Two days ago, I got into such a grumpy mood. Extremely irritable and very sad. Last night I ended up crying for no reason.

And now today I’m craving cigarettes but still not much.

I wonder if the irritability is caused by quitting? Cause as far as I know these symptoms are for the first week. Is it possible to experience withdrawal symptoms with one week delay?!

Four months circling the bowl

Well I fucked up hard. I had a good four months on, was getting back in shape, breathing was better, didn't fee like smoking at all. Go got mangled at a party and had a few. Then bought a pack. Now I'm back here at the bottom of the barrel, smoking away again.

Not sure where to go from here. Going to go back cold turkey, but I fee like such a piece of shit. Don't throw your quit away, it's the worst.

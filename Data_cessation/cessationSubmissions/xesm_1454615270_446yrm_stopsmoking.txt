5 months quit and a broken leg

I broke my leg five days ago and it gave me a whole new appreciation for having quit smoking successfully. When they asked me at the hospital if I smoked, I proudly said no. I would've had an even worse time if I was constantly craving a cigarette. It never seems like it's a good time to quit but there will always be a reason later when you're glad you put in the effort to quit. Stay strong!

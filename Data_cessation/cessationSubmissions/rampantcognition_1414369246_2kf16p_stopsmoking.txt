Recent quitter; friends don't take it seriously because I'm still using an e-cig.

Title says it all. Almost at a week; which is the longest I've been without a cigarette in almost five years. 20 a day in the last 2 - I'm pretty addicted. I've been using an e-cigarette to satisfy my cravings, but all my friends say it doesn't count, it's just as unhealthy, I'm not doing it properly yadda yadda yadda. It's really killing my confidence on it and I can feel myself sliding back towards cigarettes.

Grumble. I wanna stop for good.

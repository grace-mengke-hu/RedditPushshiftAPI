My significant other's Quitting Plan/Results. Is this ok?

Hey guys, 

My boyfriend quit smoking in January when we started dating. He largely did it for me he says, which I always told him he needed to do it for himself as well. But anyways:

He cut down then quit and went on the patch for a few weeks in Jan. After that, he basically only used nicotine mints. 

He's had a few slip ups (when drinking, etc.) but overall has done pretty well. 

However, he still has the mints (although has cut down on the number and dosage over time). 

He's very pleased with his progress but he seems to be happy with a "middle road where he knows he may have a moment of weakness once a month and want to smoke." 

To me, that's unacceptable, and doesn't feel like he's fully committing to quitting. Smoking is an addiction and having any half baked/still open option, mentally, to smoking, seems I'll conceived/overall a bad idea.

He acknowledged that that was reasonable while also feeling personally proud of getting where he is. He smoked for 12 years. He also says I can't understand because I never smoked. True.

What so y'all think? Is a weening down like this normal? Or is this a bit of a cop out? I'm not so worried about him still having the mints, but I wonder if it's normal. I also wonder about this idea, that seems to persist in his head, around being somewhat ok with a slip up. Or just being proud of where he is now, vs. fully acknowledging going completely cold turkey.

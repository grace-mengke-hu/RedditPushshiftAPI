Help with the exhaustion!! (Day 3)

Cravings are minimal and manageable, everything else is fine but I am so exhausted. I literally am struggling to keep my head up. I've tried walking around in the cool weather, napping in my car and getting to bed as soon as I can when I get home. Any other tips? It's really making me want to smoke so I can keep my eyes open!!

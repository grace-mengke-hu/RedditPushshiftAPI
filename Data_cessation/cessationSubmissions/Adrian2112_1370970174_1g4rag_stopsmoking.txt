What's the best quit smoking app for the iPhone? (iOS 6)

I've seen quit pro and a few others but I don't know much about the functionality of the different ones. It doesn't matter if its paid or not, i just want something to help. I am expecting a child in December and want to quit smoking for myself and for my future child. 

Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated! Thanks

98 Days

After 15 years of smoking, and never even attempting to quit, I tried putting cigarettes down 98 days ago and never picked them back up.  

My biggest fear about quitting came true: I have gained about 15 lbs on a body that was already about 15 lbs overweight... but I am no longer a smoker so therefore I feel comfortable with running and exercising now! I also now know that I have the willpower and dedication it takes to make life-changing choices.

It took about 2 weeks for me to stop thinking about smoking nonstop, everyday. Now I think about it once every couple of days, mostly when I can smell smoke on someone else. I am so happy I no longer smell that way! I still have to force myself to ditch the idea of "just one won't hurt", every single time I think about smoking again... but hey, that is much, much easier to do than forking up $6 a day for a pack.


I have been proud of myself for every single day that has passed without a puff and you should be too, whether it has been 1 or 875 days! Good job and congrats on taking control of your life!

EDIT: I guess my counter says 99 days, but technically it has only been 98!

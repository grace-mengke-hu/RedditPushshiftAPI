Day 11 - Little to no cravings

This is the longest I went without any nicotine in my system. I have no cravings or very little ones. I can wake up without thinking about smoking. However, I do have some dreams with tobacco in them and I confuse the dreams with reality and I think I have smoked recently, but I didn't. It's not on an extreme belief but it's just a gut feeling.

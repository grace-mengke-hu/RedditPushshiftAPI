10 Years I've been wanting to quit

Hey guys,

I've been smoking for ten years a pack a day, and last month I decided to quit for good.

I've always wanted to quit. But damn, this is SO hard.

The first week was awful. I was really becoming crazy. My girlfriend could not say a word without me yelling for no reason.

I felt so stressed, that I decided to smoke one, one night after one of our biggest fight (for absolutely no real reason).

I've been hiding for a while, and this week, I decided to quit again.


It might be stupid, but I've decided to give my wallet to a colleague during the week. So basically, I don't have money anymore. If I want to buy anything, he is coming with me. And the weekend I'm with my girlfriend.

I want to keep this for the next 3 weeks. The only thing I could do to smoke would be to ask a smoker a cigaret, but it's much harder and it requires you see a smoker close to you during the 10 minutes you really need it.

So far so good. I feel amazingly tensed, but I decided to start running again. I'm feeling proud of my body again.

This one is the right one. Ciao, I've decided to be kinder with my body.

One Week Smoke Free

Hello again reddit,

This is my second attempt attempt at quitting after 3 years of smoking a pack a day. The first attempt fialed after 2 days and now I finally went one week without smoking! If anyone who is trying to stay strong in the initial stages is reading this WATCH THE ALAN CARR video. I was on day 2 of quitting and after watching that video it changed my entire perspective on smoking. I thank all of you so much here for helping me do this and I honestly couldnt have done it without your guys' help!

Only smoke when I'm able to, if I'm not able to it doesn't bother me, need advice quitting permanently

Hi all, I have been smoking for a year and a half, between 3-8 a day depending, an I really want to stop. But I have a bit of a problem, in that I don't necessarily smoke every day. If I go on holiday with parents I easily go  a week or more without it even entering my thoughts, but as soon as I'm home and able to have one, I get anxious and fidgety until I do have one. I've tried stopping g a few times before, but never with much thought or conviction.
So I just need a bit of advice really, I only smoke when I'm alone such as parents/bf at work when I'm not, I have never smoked whilst at work or anything like that, and when I'm not easily able to smoke, it doesn't bother me at all. Bt I have no control over my parents schedules, so what do I do?
Any help is much appreciated.

Picked up a pack today...

So I've been a week without smoking, with cravings here and there.  Today they were really strong, and all I wanted was one cigarette.  Just one to savor and enjoy.  Maybe get to smoke in moderation.  You know how the mind makes exceptions and whatnot...

So I bought a pack.  I wanted Turkish Royals, but all they had were Golds and Silvers.

I got golds.

I ceremoniously grabbed one cig out and lit it up...

And wow, it tasted *horrible*.  Like, just terrible.

And now I *smell* terrible, my *breath* tastes terrible, and I wasted ~$8.

Ugh.  This just reinforced how much I want to quit.  Yuck.

I'm holding on to the pack so that if I ever get another urge like this, I can show myself just how disgusting they really are (without wasting more money).

I don't count this as a relapse since I didn't enjoy it, and what's a week in the long run anyway?

EDIT:  I know this seems like I'm setting myself up for failure, but I think this will work for me.  Everyone's needs and outlooks are different.  To someone who could smoke a pack a day, yeah, this is a terrible idea.  But for a 2-5 cig a day smoker like me, who never really liked cigarettes anyway (what's the definition of insanity again?), I really think I found the solution.

I was into some stuff that make cigarette addiction look like lollipops and candy canes, and if there's one thing I've learned, it's that all addicts aren't the same, and the absolute "do this or you WILL fail, you addict" mentality is well-intentioned, but pretty wrong.

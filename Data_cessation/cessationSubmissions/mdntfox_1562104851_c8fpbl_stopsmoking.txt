Quit smoking 7 weeks ago today, for good. When does the cough and sh*tty chest feeling start to go away?

I just want healthy lung functionality back. I'm 29 and right now, my chest feels sort of compressed? Not sure how to describe it. I've been having some issues with my throat and it being hard to swallow, along with high blood pressure and some light chest pain. Went to the hospital for something else but they also ran my blood, chest xray, etc and everything checked out. Am I psyching myself out? Are these side effects from quiting? Is it worse because I smoked menthols for the last 10 years? I've been eating right, drinking only water, going on occasional hikes, walking to places I would normally drive to try and get my heart rate going after being inactive for the past decade.  I never plan on touching another cigarette again. Right now, I'm just concerned about the damage I've put on my body and how to reverse it. I shouldn't feel like I'm 60 in my twenties.

Any advice is greatly appreciated.

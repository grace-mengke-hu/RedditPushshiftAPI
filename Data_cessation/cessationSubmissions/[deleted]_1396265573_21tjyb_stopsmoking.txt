Didn't feel comfortable posting this until I knew this try would be successful. Quit January 16 2014 after almost 4 years! But...

But I'm worried about my 21st birthday coming up... I used to be able to suck down a pack or more during a night of drinking and it's when I crave them the most. I haven't drank since I've quit for this and other reasons, but I'm worried about my birthday :/ How did you beat the drunk cravings monster?

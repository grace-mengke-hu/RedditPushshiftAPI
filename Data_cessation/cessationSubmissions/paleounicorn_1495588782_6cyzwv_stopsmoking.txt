venting needed.

I feel pretty lost. Quitting smoking has consumed my every thought lately. I want to so bad, but every time I do, I fail. Am I hyping myself up too much? Every time I get home from a successful smoke free work day the fog hits me, I feel like I will never be happy or productive again. Then I buy a pack, I'm mad, but relieved. I have hit a week before, but the urges are 24/7, I eat everything in sight and I'm just a mean person when quitting. I have anxiety quitting, but I also have anxiety staying like this. 

We make this toxic stick more then what really it is. We make it out to be our best friend not only in a time of need, but also fun times. When really it is an addition, we are addicts. I am disgusted how this stick makes me crazy. I feel like a prisoner with no hope or control. I know I'm rambling, but can anyone give me advice on how to stop feeling like this is impossible. Attempting again tomorrow.

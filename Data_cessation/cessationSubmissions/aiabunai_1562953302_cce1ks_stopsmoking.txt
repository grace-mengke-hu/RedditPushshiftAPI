Any of you have any good plans on staying smoke free? I'm struggling.

I've been smoking off and on for about 5 years now and I'm ready to quit. I've been cigarette free for two days now, substituting it with a vape. 

My SO is getting fed up with me on my "failures" and feels now might be a good time to write down a plan of action to keep me cigarette free. Any tips?

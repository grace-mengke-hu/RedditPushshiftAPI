Every time I try to quit I always go back

As the title says I've tried a few times. I've only been smoking maybe 6ish years but its gotten to the point my wife and I are burning through 2 packs a day. Both of her parents have had heart attacks and my father has had a stroke, all 3 of them smoked, I personally have 2 kids that I'd like to be around for a long time coming and not end up in the hospital like the rest of my family. 

There was a point where I was using a vape and actually cut myself down to 5 cigs a day. Now I'm trying to do it again and hopefully cut out cigs all together but thats not working like it did last time. I'm just smoking a vape in the car and at work now but seem to be doubling up on cigs when I'm home. I've tried the gum and it always made me feel sick, never tried a patch before and don't really trust the effectiveness of it since I've never seen it actually work for someone. Just what the hell do I need to do to stop me from killing myself?

Relapsed today :(

I caved. I've had horrible anxiety all week, and I let one slip :( I went three days without smoking, and I feel great. But I just...I dunno, I just had to get one in. I even read Allen Carr's book. I feel horrible. Gonna do my best not to slip up again, but this anxiety is just so awful. Even if smoking exacerbates it, I had to have one.

FAIL :/

I've been on and off quitting for the last year, but I keep running into the same problem.

I've been depressed for the last 10 years of my life since I started highschool when I was 14.  I started smoking when I was 19.  It helped calm me down and give me a few moments peace in a chaotic time.  I thoroughly enjoyed smoking, the flavor and the chemical effect.  I love to casually smoke with my friends.  I've been trying to quit for a year, but I always get a month or two in until I have this problem.

The last time I had a cigarette was two months ago.  And recently, my girlfriend brought up a concern that I've been noticeably more depressed, anxious, and irritable.  I know I've been mean to her, and I've been getting tiny panic attacks and mood swings.  I've also had an uncontrollable urge to consume.  I already drink a lot of water and veg snacks.  But I am not satisfied, even when I'm full.  I try chewing gum but it's not an oral fixation.

I don't like being angry, I'm not an angry person.  I'm already overweight, and the amount of food that I consume is worrying me.

I was a much happier, and I had healthier habits (aside from smoking).  And I can't take this anymore.  But I don't want to start smoking again, at anything more than socially.

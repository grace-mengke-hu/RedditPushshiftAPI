Now my friend can bring her kid to BBQs

She quit smoking last week, with ease, using Allen Carr, and realized she can now go to restaurants and bars that don't have smoking patios-- i.e., places other than dive bars. She can bring her kid with her if she wants to go to a pub and have a glass of wine. She can bring him to the beach houses we rent, and to BBQs at friends' houses.
Drinking any sort of alcohol was a big trigger for her and I'm not saying she's an alcoholic, but she's a teacher and-- sorry, but-- teachers need a glass of wine at the end of the day. (In My Experience.)
Her kid has lung issues, and she doesn't want him to see her smoking. And now she doesn't have to worry about it At All! YAY FOR ERIN!!!

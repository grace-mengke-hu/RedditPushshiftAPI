I fell off the wagon, but I think it may have been for the best.

I started the patch on Monday and was cigarette-free till this morning.  Yesterday, the patch I was wearing fell off right before I fell asleep and I didn't bother to put a new one on.  Well, I woke up really craving a cigarette.  I hadn't really ever thought through this whole "last cigarette" thing, so I thought, what the heck, this will be my last cigarette.   



I didn't finish it.  It tasted awful.  It reminded me of the first time seven years ago when I tried a cigarette really clearly, when it tasted worse than it felt good.  I put it out about halfway through (I may have hesitated--last cigarette ever and all).  I feel a little crappy for having had it at all, but there's a small part of me that is glad I did.  Now, I really feel like I'd rather be a non-smoker than an occasional smoker, or a social smoker or whatever I'd tell myself would be ok just once in a while.  Before, I really felt like I was quitting just because it was what I should do.  Now, I want to quit.  I want it for me.

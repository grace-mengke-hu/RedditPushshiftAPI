Five days in, worried the absolute boredom is going to ruin me.

I have been extremely bored since I quit smoking. Occasional craving here and there, but they're fleeting and not very intense. It's the *boredom* that is driving me out of my mind. I have no money so I don't really go anywhere. I don't have friends, really. I quit playing video games temporarily because they are a smoking trigger for me. It's cold as balls out. I've basically spent the last five days crocheting and watching TV and I'm about to rip my eyeballs out, I'm so freaking antsy and bored. I just want to sit outside and smoke a cigarette. I didn't smoke in my house so as lame as it sounds, smoking was a thing to do. Get up, put my shoes on, grab a drink and my cell phone, go outside, and smoke while browsing Reddit or playing games on my phone. And I'm losing my shit without that. I don't know what to do with myself. The house is clean, I don't really have any projects that need started or anything. Ugh.

Todayâ€™s a better day

One day at a time I guess. Today didnâ€™t even think about smoking but once for a fleeting moment. I guess I just look for excuses sometimes. Even at my maddest though, i wonâ€™t break! I just canâ€™t do it to myself. Sunday will be two months. Season is changing tomorrow here, so Iâ€™ve made it or of the summer (although where I live, itâ€™ll feel like summer for another month ðŸ˜‚) longest in my adult life that I have been w/o a cigarette (any nicotine). I do smell a little better (but I always did have a strong sense of smell). Things taste a little better too. Iâ€™ve definitely come to a point that now that Iâ€™m fixing that, Iâ€™m trying to fix all aspects of my life and health (bad habit wise). Not too much junk eating so I actually lost weight!! That was a big concern since I had recently lost some, I thought Iâ€™d gain weight!  Anyway, donâ€™t give up people! U can do it! Fuck those ciggies!

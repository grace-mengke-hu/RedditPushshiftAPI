Day 2 and no cravings?

This is my final quit, I've had a few (temporarily) successful quits before. 16 year smoker, really. Up to 20+ a day at time, most in the afternoons after work.

I'm only on day 2 (just passed the 48 hour mark) and I've noticed that only day 1 did I have really bad cravings. Today I barely thought of them, only when I walked past the many many convenience stores on my street where pretty much every worker knows my brand. 

My question is.. am I lucky? Have I just had a good day, or have other people not had very bad cravings after the first day? Any experiences will be helpful and interesting to hear!

Keep on being quitters everyone! You're inspirations!

Day 0. Hour 0. Minute 10.

After getting my heart broken a week ago today, I started smoking again after 10 months free.

I'm going to be honest, it helped. There was no other thing at the time that gave me the kind of reassurance I needed.

But I know that it destroys me, not only because I have been getting headaches again, dry mouth, loss of taste, shortness of breath but most importantly it has killed my confidence, that again, I started.

And there is no better way to start reconstructing yourself than to quit one of the worse habit one can have.

Wish me luck, this is going to be hard with the break up still on my mind, but I know I can do this, I owe it to myself.

Peace, and good luck to all of you, you can do it if you set your mind to it.

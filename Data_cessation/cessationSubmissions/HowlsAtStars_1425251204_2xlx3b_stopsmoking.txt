2 days

Day 2: Saved 10 Euro already, the constant reek around me is gone, but hell it ain´t easy.

I smoked between one and two packs a day in the last 24 years! I tried to stop before and got  weak after 3 to 4 days. I had the most problems with my sudden  moodshifts and agression. 

Well i know 2 days is nothing and there will be weeks ahead that won´t be fun. I bought nicotine gums but i am not a fan of them. I want to be fully away from nicotine. First day i had 3 gums, today i had 2.
Today i am most of the time  okay, not good but good enough. From time to time i want a cigi and i see my hand already move to where the package and the lighter are normally, then i realize there aren´t any cigarettes and its like someone punshes me in the head. My body shakes and i feel like fucking dying for a moment.

 I am alone in this. I try to see it from a positive side. Nobody there to blame when i feel really bad. Tomorrow and the day after i got appointments. Not looking forward to it but i will explain that i stopped smoking and hope  people will understand.

From time to time it is like a window opens, a wave appears. I failed to catch that wave the last years, got too busy or bad things happened. This time i caught it. There was this guy writing about his disease and how he will die soon. A 24 y o. About  half my age and so full of wisdom. It had an effect on me and it came right with the wave.

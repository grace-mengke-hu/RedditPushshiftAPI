Natural ways to whiten teeth?

So I quit smoking after many years and want to restore my teeth to their former glory. Whitening strips always made my teeth extra sensitive, so I'm trying to steer clear of that. Any helpful advice would be appreciated. 
And also any teas or detoxes I can do to try and help my body heal and help clean out my lungs faster. I'm ashamed of how far I let this go. I'm trying to get healthier now and I want these toxins out of my body.

1805 days. 5 Year mark coming up. Woot.

Smoked for 20 years.  The day I bought my first vape, I threw out all my tobacco and never looked back.  I can breathe again, I can smell and taste again, I'm not "that guy" on the elevator that just came back from a smoke break and stinks up the place.  Couldn't be any happier about it.

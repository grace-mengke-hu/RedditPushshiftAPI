Need to quit....again

Started a few weeks ago after a bender and now im struggling. I'm a chain smoker and it's only been a short time but damn my lungs can't take it hard to breathe but my brain can't help but want another. Debating trashing this pack and going cold turkey again. 

Send positive vibes, I quit 5 years ago hoping this is not gonna suck like the last time.

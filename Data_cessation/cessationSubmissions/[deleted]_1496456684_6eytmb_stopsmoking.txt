Just felt like sharing

So just got in from my first night out since quitting and I'm so proud to say i didn't give in!!! I genuinely thought this would be my point of failure but I stayed strong and kept thinking if I smoke now I will have to start all over again and it's work, must admit I was craving more than ever but just wanted to share how proud of myself I am :)

Starting my day 3 of quitting and staying quit

Hi there. i am startng y day 3. Yesterday evening i reaaaally really wanted to have one and my mind was tricking me. i was also feeling sad. but today i dont feel cravings and feel way better. What helps me currently is o rad howhard it is actually to quit cigarettes. that very few people stay quit any given attempt, also as time passes it gets harder and harer so every single cigarette is imprisoning me further in an addiction that is so hard to quit.

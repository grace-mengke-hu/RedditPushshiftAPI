Quit day 1- How to deal with the negative self talk?

I've been smoking for about 12 years now. I only tried to quit once before while I was on a holiday and it lasted a little over a month before I relapsed. I quit again today. I realized my biggest problem is self talk. When I'm smoking I know how horrible it is for me and I want to quit. As soon as I quit it is like a different part of me kicks in and just goes on and on about how I really want another cigarette. The rational part of me disappears. Then when I smoke I again feel stupid and realize what a mistake it has been. Any tips on how to handle this double sided self talk?

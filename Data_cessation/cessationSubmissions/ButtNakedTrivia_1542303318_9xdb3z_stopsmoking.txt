First day of many...

I have been a smoker for the past 15 years. It has gone from a pack a day habit, to a pack a week habit. I’ve tried in the past to quit, but just haven’t been able to do so. 
I just found out that I will be a first time father, and I truly feel that is the inspiration I need to put down the cigarettes for good. If not for my sake, then for my child’s sake.

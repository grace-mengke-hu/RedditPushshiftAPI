I ate two ice cream sandwiches today

I don't even care. My gf keeps saying it's easier to lose weight than to cure cancer, so many times that it's starting to piss me off. if it weren't for her quitting with me I would not have as much confidence as I do and I love her for that but DAMN I will be surprised if we don't kill each other before the cravings fade away lol

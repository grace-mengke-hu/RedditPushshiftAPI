I havea weird question

Been smokefree for 18 days now. I had a dream last night in which I commited suicide. I‘m not suicidal at all so I was surprised about that.

I googled that and apparently a lot of people who quit an addiction like smoking cigarettes have dreams like that.

So I‘m curious if you also experience such dreams?

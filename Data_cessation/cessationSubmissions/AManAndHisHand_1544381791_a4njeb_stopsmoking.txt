Painful itching sensation

I associate nicotine craving with painful blisters on my tounge. Anyone else get these?

I can't have an ocassional cigarette since I get an itchy/painful sensation in my mouth for multiple days each time after smoking. When I tell my friends about my problem they seem confused and say they've never had it. I told doctors about it and they think my tounge is twitching and making contact with my teeth which causes irritation and results in the blisters. I'm not sure but it doesn't matter. It just keeps me focused on not smoking anymore because I know what happens if I take just one...

My curiosity got the best of me and since I recently discovered this subreddit I wanted to ask if anyone else has/had this problem? Maybe highlighting this problem will cause somebody else to give up the habit. Good luck!

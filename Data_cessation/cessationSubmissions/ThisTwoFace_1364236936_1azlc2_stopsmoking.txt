I need to quit.

I have been smoking four years now ever since I started social smoking when I was 16. I didn't realize what addition brought. It was a terrible choice that I want to repent after I had been told what a cost it is on myself and the money I make.

Now I'm joining the Army where I am going to Airborne School to head off to Ranger School. It is rigorous and physically demanding- something smoking has taken away from me being an All Star football defensive end/ offensive end. All I have is 20 days before I ship out.

I know that in basic training regulation does not allow you to smoke, but once graduated smokers are granted more breaks and non smokers don't get breaks as often. It's like they want you to smoke. It keeps that incentive there.

I need useful tips, anything that can help me quit my nicotine addiction. I need a good route to take to getting my physical endurance back, something I lost once I picked up my first cigarette. Can anyone relate?

**UPDATE** : 

So I bought the book. *The Easy Way To Stop Smoking*, by Allen Carr. I'm on chapter 3 and I am confused. Confused in a positive way, but also in a negative way. I already have the urge and understanding that it does nothing for me- to quit and not light another- , but I am scared I will still want to smoke because right now I just need to quit, not because I want to quit. I also feel that I don't have to smoke, but that I want to smoke. It's also confounding me to believe this is just dubious and selfempowering nonsense, but it's working.

I come from a Christian background, and regard myself as reasonable, a realist. I believe mysteries are solved by intense logical thinking, but to our own power find fallacies in our own mystysism of rational thought. This book it's putting a strange lightbulb in my head, just as far as I read. I'm going to continue reading it. Just as nauseous as it is making me, the truth is nauseating.

**UPDATE 2** :

The book told me that I should remain smoking until I finished reading its entirety. I said to myself "Great! A long read, I can smoke through the whole thing? EASY!" It wasn't until after I got to about chapter 15 or so that I had completely switched gears. I was moping to myself, "Great. I have to smoke until I finish this book."

I smoked a pack a day. I smoked my last pack. I smoked my last cigarette. I smoked my last drag. And I. Feel. EMPOWERED. I feel great to rid the clutches it once had on me! I am not worried about smoking, rather, I want to sleep and see what this can do for me tomorrow, next week, month, until I die.


Aaaaawwweee Yyyeeaaahhh, I'm a non-smoker! (Because who says 'yippee' anymore? Hah!

I want to thank God, first of all, for getting me this far in life and the people I experience, telling me in prayer to quit (randomly and when I asked), and leading me to to y'all. I want to thank Allan Carr for what he's done for me through his book, showing me myself for what I was really doing to myself. I especially want to thank y'all. You guys are doing a tremendous *habit* of leading people to quit the **addiction**!

With out any of these factors present, I would not feel so great to quit and get back in control over myself. Thank you. Every single one of you in /r/stopsmoking.

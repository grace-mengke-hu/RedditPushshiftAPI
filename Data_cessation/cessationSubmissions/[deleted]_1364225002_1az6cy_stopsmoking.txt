Yesterday on my 3rd day of quitting I had a drag. Does that mean I failed? 

So I was chilling with a smoker friend who I didn't tell that I quit again. We go for the smoke and he gives me one. I take one drag and realize what I've done. Then I was just holding the cigarette but not smoking it. In the end I put it off. My mind felt a boost as I smoked, it felt clear. 

Am I on my fourth day today or the first? It was just one drag..

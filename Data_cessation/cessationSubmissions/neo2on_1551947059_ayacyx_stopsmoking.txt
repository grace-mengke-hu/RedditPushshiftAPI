Want to quit!

I started smoking since I was a kid (can't believe we thought that smoking was cool). 16 years later and I am now 31 and a smoker. I was smoking 1-2 packs a day. For the last few years, I have been having difficulty breathing and sometimes waking up with chest pain, so I decided to quit. I actually attempted to quit a few times and the best I got was smoking about 15 cigs a day. I tried to gradually lower the number of cigarettes I have each day, but it was too hard to keep track of it and would end up failing to quit.

This time I tried something different, I got an app to help me quit. I saw someone posting a screenshot of an app showing when they quit. I liked the idea and even though I could not find the same app for android, I found something similar (EasyQuit Stop Smoking) and set my quit day in 2 weeks. In ten days I was able to drop my daily cigarettes to 5 cigarettes.  This is a great accomplishment for me. 

Now, I am thinking of staying on the 5 cigarettes a day for an extra week or two to mentally prepare for it lol. I thought I would ask this here and maybe see people's opinion on the matter. I know it sounds like I am looking for an excuse to continue smoking, maybe it is. Honestly, today was just too tough for me and I almost broke down a few times. I can't imagine myself lowering it even more and committing to it. 

How was your experience? was it easier to limit the number of cigarettes you had for a while then quit. or commit to your plan that you initially set for yourself. Did changing anything with your plan make you stop working on it and you got back to your usual smoking habits?

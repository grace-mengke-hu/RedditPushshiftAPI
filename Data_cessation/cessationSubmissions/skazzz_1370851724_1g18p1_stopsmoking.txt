Almost at two weeks, but not out of the woods.

So I was doing fine at days 7-10 but the last two days cigarettes are all I can think about. I'm pretty resolved to stay quit so I'm not really worried about relapse, but I'm really fucking annoyed because I thought I was through worrying about smoking but here I am with cravings worse than they have been the last few days. My fellow quitters, please assure me that things will soon get easier and stay that way.

I'm finally fucking trying.

I've heard that it's not good to share your goals before you've made any kind of meaningful step towards reaching them, but I think I'm a little too selfish to not share. This has been the first week in a fairly long time since I've actually wanted to quit. I'm 19, I'm a pack a day smoker and have been for about four years and I'm currently on my third nicotine free day. 

I know I'm currently facing down the barrel of a LOT of challenges and tests ahead and maybe it's a little too early to be making such a post but I just NEEDED someone else to see this and acknowledge the fact that I'm taking this step towards bettering myself because I'm sick and fucking tired of being where I am.

It's sad.

I'm smoke free for 12 days and 3 hrs. All these posts are really instructive and helpful for those who are quitting. Why I feel sad? It's because I realised how much bad I did to my precious body during those years being a smoker. Today I'm feeling great, no serious carvings and full of energy + knowing I'm no more addicted. If only youngsters could take all these ads to prevent smoking seriously and not fall into the trap.

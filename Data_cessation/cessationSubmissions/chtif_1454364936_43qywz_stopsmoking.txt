Horrible at quitting

Hi, So this is my first reddit post, ever.
I'm a 19 years old male, Been smoking for 4 Years, Since I began smoking My longest successful quitting attempt was, around a day.
The amount of cigarettes I smoke depends on how my day is going, during exams week etc.. I can go up to a pack and a half, and other days like these, I'm at 10-15 cigarettes.
Every night I make up my mind, and say ! this is it, tomorrow is a new day ! as soon as I wake up, drink my coffee, Boom. "Brain fog", I can't get anything done, can't concentrate on studies, can't deal with people, until I get my first cigarette.
I always find an excuse to have just one more cigarette (Too much stuff to do, Have to study for the exams, and can't do that without smoking, blah blah..)
and with every puff I take, my guilt just gets worse and worse, I don't even enjoy it as I used to.
Help :(

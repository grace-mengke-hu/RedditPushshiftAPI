Anger When Quitting

When quitting smoking, it is common to get angrier than normal. You are suffering from nicotine withdrawal and perhaps have a distorted view that you're giving up your "only friend" *shudder* I believe that one of the reasons anger is a problem is that you no longer have an automatic out of an emotional or stressful situation. 

Up until your quit, your life may have went like this: Fight with the wife? Go outside and smoke to cool off. Screwed over at work? Go bitch to the other smokers around the smoke pit. But when you are quitting, you no longer have that tapout button. For the first time in maybe decades you are forced to confront emotional or stressful situations without being able to go out and smoke. Maybe you even recognize this, making you even angrier.

My point is that life happens. There are going to be stressful days where you normally would go smoke a couple cigarettes and try to work through things. Figure out what chills you out so you have tools ready to go before a situation arises. Remember that returning to smoking is just going to compound your problems.

The idea that at this point in my life that I would ever reach for a cigarette to feel better is ridiculous. I'm just that over nicotine, as long as I never ingest it. You can get to that point. Don't let anything convince you that having a cigarette will make a situation better.

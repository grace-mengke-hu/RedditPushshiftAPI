Cravings

I'm starting to want food more than cigarettes. 

I can't stop thinking about what I will eat next now that my sense of taste/smell is beginning to return. 

I still crave for a cigarette, but it's not worth it. 

Edit: Tomorrow will be the local BBQ joint, wings with baked beans and fried okra. The baked beans have bits of bacon and pork mixed in.

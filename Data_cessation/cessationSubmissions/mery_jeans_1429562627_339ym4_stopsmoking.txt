Hi, my name is Mery and im an ex smoker!!

Hi everybodY. Let me introduce myself. My name is Mery and i havent smoked for the last 9 days.
some people would say im just a quitter but I already consider myself a non smoker. I smoked for half of my life. I dont remember if i was 13, 14 or 15. The only thing I know ks that smoking has been a very important part of my life.
People like you, who help each other to meet their goals are the reason many of us are no smokers.
Besides the cravings (i have hundreds everyday and a terrible terrible mood) what desperates me is how long it will take to recover my health completely.
How do you deal with that?? Thanks a los for your help and support!!

Day 1 with Chantix

So today is my day 1 of taking Chantix. I know it's had some mixed reviews but I'm going to try it and if I get weirded out I'll just stop. I'm technically allowed to smoke for a few days but I don't get the purpose of that. Cigarettes already stink to me that's why I wanted to quit in the first place. What does everyone do at first during the time they would normally take smoke breaks, specifically in the car? As soon as I get in my car I want to light up so I think that will be my worst temptation.

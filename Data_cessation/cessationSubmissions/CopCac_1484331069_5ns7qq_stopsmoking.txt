13 Hours in on Day 1

Alright, so I had gotten myself down to a few cigarettes a day as of yesterday and I am now 13 hours, 6 minutes into my first day cigarette free. I'm using the patch and I gotta say... I feel great. Better than I have in a while. I've managed to stop fidgeting while I drive and I have stopped wanting to go out for a smoke between games of DoTA and rounds of CS:GO so I think it's going to stick this time.

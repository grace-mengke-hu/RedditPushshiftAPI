Dangers to non smokers

Hello I just have a quick question.  I am hosting a game night and one of my friends smokes (only smokes outside), is that dangerous to non smokers health?  He comes back inside with a smell of cigarettes on his breath.  It is not second hand smoke right, so what is it called then and is it bad to smell it?  Thanks!

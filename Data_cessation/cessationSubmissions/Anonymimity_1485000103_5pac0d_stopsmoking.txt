How to resist routine smoking

Hello everyone,  I've just discovered this subreddit and am hoping you guys can shed some light for me. I'm ready to quit smoking and i don't think it'll be difficult for me to do so. When I'm home, smoking doesn't even cross my mind. I've never smoked in my car and don't consider it. My one issue however  smoking at work. My work buddies have made it a routine to walk outside every hour or so for a smoke. I've become part of this routine and feel like they would think differently of me for not joining them. What's a good way to disconnect myself from this group but not lose any friends in the process?

I made it a week, woohoo!

I've been an on/off quitter since July. This is the farthest I've gotten since the first time I tried.

Admittedly, I had a smoke last night. But my last one (on 10/16) didn't have the finality this one had. It was gross, it tasted like each drag was a lick of an ashtray. My hands stunk. My throat reacted in a very weird way and all of a sudden, I was really raspy. I stubbed it out 3/4s of the way through and thought, "yeah, you suck."

But, tips for all y'all quitters: gum is the best thing that has ever happened to me. And now on my breaks at work, I go outside and sit in my old smoking spot and write, read or draw. It's way more fulfilling than smoking.

Question: My quitting process has involved nicotine lozenges. I'm almost out and don't really want to buy more. What will I experience when I run out and don't supply my body with nicotine? I use 4mg lozenges every 2-4 hours or so, I used to be a pack a day smoker.

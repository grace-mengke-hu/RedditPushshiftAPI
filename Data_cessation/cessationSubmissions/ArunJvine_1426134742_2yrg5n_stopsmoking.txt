How to avoid being a passive smoker???

I party with my friends once in a month.  I'm not a smoker any more,  but my friends smoke.   If I'm in the vicinity of my friends without smoking,  I'm a passive smoker which is as harmful as being a smoker in the first place. How can I face the situation.!!

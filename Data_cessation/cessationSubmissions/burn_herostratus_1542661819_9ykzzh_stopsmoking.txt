I need to rant because it's hard

I know it would be good to quit, I just don't have balls to finally make a decision and stick to it. I tried to quit so many times since September, I'm so tired of all this shit. I hate withdrawals, I hate relapsing, I hate myself. I've been smoking for five years 10-15 cigs a day and it feels exactly the same as ending the toxic, but somehow still epic friendship. Like, yeah, that shit is gonna kill me someday but I can't imagine living without it for the rest of my life. I feel insane 'cause I know all the reasons to quit but then again lit a goddamn cig. I wish I never smoked that first cigarette. 

I will try again in the morning. It will stick in the end.

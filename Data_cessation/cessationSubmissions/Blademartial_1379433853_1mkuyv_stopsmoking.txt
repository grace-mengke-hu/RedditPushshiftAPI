60 days and going strong!

Very pleased with myself (and wife)!  We're officially at 60 days today and going strong.  Still have the occasional moment of fighting-with-a-craving, but 60 days without cheating, falling off the wagon, etc.  Thanks to all who post, who cheer, who listen and talk here.  Thanks!  Keep up the awesome support, advice, and conversations.  They help!

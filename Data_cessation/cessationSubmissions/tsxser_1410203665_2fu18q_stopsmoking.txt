Haven't been a smoker for a long time, but I already feel the pains of smoking.

I started smoking in Nov of last year, due to stress and depression. Now Ive been involved with a healthy relationship for 7 months (a non-smoker) and stressors have the ability to be manageable. 

But man, I love the morning cigarette, and hate the fact I hide it from my girlfriend. I feel ashamed right after I put the cigarette out.

My mother and stepfather are heavy chain smokers, have a damn e-cig hung around their necks by lanyard and smoke paul mauls outside. The smell gets me, almost makes me gag, but I go back home and smoke a cigarette the next morning. 

I assume my issue is that I hate having "free time," just sitting around. My goal is to begin working out again, I WANT TO RUN A MARATHON! I hate those damn 13.1km stickers, but wow, I would love to have a reason to purchase one.  

I'm a film photographer, and a retoucher. I state this because my time spent at a computer scanning film negatives in or retouching , is quite plentiful. Having a cigarette in between all of this is just an great reason to step away from my computer. 

Sorry for this lengthy post, but its more of an outlet and rant to myself to motivate me to quit this horrible habit. 

Help me guys!

Trying to quit, I have a few questions.

I bought a really nice vape last night that is really helping so far, but I still have the urges to follow my routine. Go sit outside for a minute and smoke while reading. My question is, should I follow my normal routine using the vape instead of smoking? Or should I try to break the routine and make a new one with my vape? Thanks for any and all help. You guys really motivated me with all of your success stories.

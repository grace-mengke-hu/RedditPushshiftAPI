Tonight is the night

Tonight is my last night smoking cigarettes. I have 4 left and plan on smoking them within the next 2 hours. I'm so sick of smoking and what is has done to my health and social life. I am a little scared about the withdrawal. Scared I will freak out at work or school, scared I will not be able to sleep, scared I will fail. But I am going to try. God help me.

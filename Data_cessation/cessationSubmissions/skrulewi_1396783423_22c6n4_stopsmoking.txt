120 Hours, day 6.

Last day of this.

I played ultimate frisbee again, nearly vomited again, but somehow just felt more and more amazing. Drove home from the field thinking 'Wow, I can run again. I can go outside and run knowing that I'll get stronger, not weaker, over time, because of goddamn cigarettes.'

Didn't do very much else today besides hang out with a bunch of women, played some music with them, and then things got extremely goofy and flirty. Like others have posted, my self-esteem since making this decision has been through the roof. I really think that I hated myself a little bit for every cigarette I smoked... and I was stuffing it, bit by little bit. There's lots of things in my life that need self improvement, that I need to continue to work on. But that was one thing that I flat out hated myself for. And there's only so much I can cover that up, rationalize that away, and joke about it to people... and even if I can do all those things, I can't joke about it to myself. I know how I felt about smoking.

OK, one more post to go then the week is over.

Healthy Glow is BackðŸ¤—

My ego is nurtured by my skinâ€™s slow revival. My face has a slight glow, (something missing for over a decade) and many small surface bumps are becoming smooth again (I think this was a reaction to my night-shade allergy...yes, I smoked for over a decade and was/am allergic to itðŸ˜”). Replacing my morning smoke with applying sunscreen has been an investment in my surface health - and Iâ€™ll take vanity as a motivator to keep going. There are so many reasons to quit smoking for improved health and longevity- but many I cannot see. Iâ€™m pleasantly surprised that the person in the mirror these days is younger and healthier looking than before. Of course my added SPF routine is helping too! SPF for CIG: Instant skin rewind that costs less than a pack of cigarettes. ðŸ¤— day 24

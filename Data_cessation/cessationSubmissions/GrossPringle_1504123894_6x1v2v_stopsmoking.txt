My boyfriend wants to start vaping

Hi everyone. My bf and I quit together, and a few days ago he says he wants to start vaping - he says he misses smoking and would like to consume nicotine without the smell or the stigma. I said he's just addicted. (When we were smoking he never really thought he was that addicted.) Anyway, I'm really worried that if he starts vaping he'll eventually want to smoke the real thing. We've been free of cigs for 20 days now... I just don't see why he'd want to introduce nicotine into his system all over again.

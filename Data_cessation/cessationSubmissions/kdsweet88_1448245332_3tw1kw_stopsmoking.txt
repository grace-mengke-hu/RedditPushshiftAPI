Smoke free for 2 days using patches!

Just finishing up day 2 of not smoking.  It's going pretty well, much better than I hoped for!  Patches are amazing.  However, I would really like to find someone who's "Been there, done that" for advice, holding me accountable....I thought I had someone, but it didn't really pan out.  I have my fiance, but he's never smoked so he doesn't really know what it's like.

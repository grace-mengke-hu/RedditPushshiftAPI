I think I’m done with this sub.

When I first quit smoking it was a great help but now all it does is remind me of what I used to do. I honestly barely think about smoking at all anymore. I can hang out with smokers, I can drink with smokers, I can do all the things now, just without smoking. It’s pretty great. The smell of smoke doesn’t trigger cravings anymore (boy did it use to!), nor does it nauseate me (for awhile after I quit I couldn’t bear it). Now it’s just a thing that I don’t do. Smoking just isn’t part of my life.

So yeah, I’m quitting this sub now. I don’t need it anymore. Good luck to you all, maybe someday you won’t need this sub either.

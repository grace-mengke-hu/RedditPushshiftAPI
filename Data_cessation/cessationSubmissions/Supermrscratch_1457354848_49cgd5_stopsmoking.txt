Been 2 months and 4 days since my Mom quit. Need advice !

Hello guys, its been around 2 months and 4 days since my mom quit smoking after a lot of nagging, she's 35 and was smoking for about 18 years (except for the times she was pregnant with me and my siblings) and I'm still worried about her health and cravings sometimes.

Could you guys please tell me whether or not she might be having COPD and what else I could do to prevent her from craving in the future? She had quit for a year around 10 years ago but she had started again and it honestly just freaks me out.

Thanks in advance !

I don't know how to start...

So here's a quick story about me. I'm 18 and I started smoking 3 months ago because of all the stress from school. It helped get through classes and I got great grades. I need to quit now though, because I feel like my left lung is no shut down. I get lung (Maybe heart) pain all night and it just feels like crap. It's not really painful type of pain, but rather that annoying pain that makes you realize you need to quit but you find it really hard too.

Every time, i promise myself that this will be the last pack I buy, and by the time it's over, I end up buying another last pack. I also barely exercise or play any sports which is probably a factor in why it hit me so bad in only 3 months. Can anyone give me advice on how to initiate the whole quitting scene? Going cold turkey works, but only for 6 hours, before I find myself just dying to get one last pack. I have no idea where to start...

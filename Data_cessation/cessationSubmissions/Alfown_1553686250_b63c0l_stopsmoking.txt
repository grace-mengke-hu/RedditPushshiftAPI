Quit smoking for the first time. No motivation to do anything. Life feels pointless. Wtf?

I've been smoking for about five years. I've never had any reason to even try quitting until now, so I've not had a day without smoking since I started.

It's been three days since my last smoke, and I feel like shit. Like there's nothing else I want to do. Watch a movie? Nah. Go for a walk? Nah. I feel like everything is pointless. I know that sounds incredibly dramatic, but like three days ago I was happy watching YouTube or just sitting with my dog, every couple of hours I'd go for a smoke. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm just like, what's the point? Might as well just go to sleep and wait for work to start tomorrow morning.

Is this normal? How do I stop this? I've never felt like this before. It's totally weird.

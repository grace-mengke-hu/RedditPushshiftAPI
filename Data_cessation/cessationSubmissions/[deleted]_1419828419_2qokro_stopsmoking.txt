I didn't know I had it in me

I'm 20 days quit, which is a miracle.  I was hardcore, >20 years.  Smoking was the first thing I did each morning and the last thing at night.  In between was all about how and when I would get my next smoke.  It was an integral part of my life.   

I spent the first couple of weeks reaching for the pack that was no longer there.  I learned that a million triggers exist that I never knew before.  I felt the complexities of real withdrawal.  And I learned that it's not for wimps.    

But after having lived through the cravings I figured out that the harshest part tends to last only about 3-5 minutes.  So I ask myself... "Is success worth 3-5 minutes?"  

Haven't cheated.  Not even once.  And although I know it's a tired expression, I'll say it anyway... "If I can do it, you can do it."

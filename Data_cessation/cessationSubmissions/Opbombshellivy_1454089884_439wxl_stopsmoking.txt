I cannot possibly be this hungry..

I haven't been eating to quell cravings, i'm legitimately starving the second I wake up then a few hours later,then a few hours later.. and so on. I almost don't feel like I get full. I'm 33 F Not "big" (like 132 and 5ft4) I dont mind if I put on some weight, fuck it, thats my next thing to take care of right? In the mean while I'm just shocked by this seriously drastic change in my self.

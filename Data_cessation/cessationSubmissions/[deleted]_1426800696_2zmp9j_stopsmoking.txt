My cat

For years i was one of those 'once in awhile' smokers. At a party, with friends who smoke. In the last 3 years it has escalated to smoking 3-10 cigarettes per day. I spend a fair bit of time alone which I think has allowed me to both hide my habit from others and even deny to myself how addicted I have become. I am actually quite health conscious in every other way: eat very clean, exercise at least 5 times a week, cycle nearly every day. . . it's just these damn cigs. Smoking right after a healthy breakfast and intense workout, what could be more self defeating!

During this last unbelievably cold winter I have even been having the occasional smoke inside-windows open and fans on but still! Gross!
Last night I was indulging in said gross behavior when my cat wandered into the room, looked me right in the eye, sneezed hard, and then walked out. That's IT!!

I am done with grossing out my cat, smelling awful, ruining my face and body and wasting money! I'm actually quite scared about quitting which indicates to me how bad this stupid addiction has gotten.

I think my first purchase with the money I save will be an awesome new cat toy.

Just had my last smoke

So I've decided to quit smoking finally, I have smoked for about 3-4 years a 25 pack a day atleast! 

I have decided for my health, partner and finances I need to STOP SMOKING now my partner dislikes it and I do not blame her as it costs money and costs me my health. 

I hope I can stay on track and not have another smoke ever!

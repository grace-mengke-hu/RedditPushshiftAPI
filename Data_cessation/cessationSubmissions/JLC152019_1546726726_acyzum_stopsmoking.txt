Finding it tough...

I’m day 4 of not smoking and trying to stay positive. I’ve been smoking for about 25 years and have tried many times to quit. I’ve never gone longer than 3 months. Funny thing was I wasn’t even planning to quit but I was too embarrassed to go buy a pack on the day that most people quit... so I didn’t leave my house. I’m finding that boredom is my trigger.

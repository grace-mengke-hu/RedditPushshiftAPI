9 Days... Getting Easier

From a 27 year smoker:

Come prepared for that Nic-Fit.

I purchased the Eleaf-iStick with Autilaus tank using a 15mg nic juice.
Am also using 21mg patch and 14mg gum used and tried once. The gum did not work for me at all.

The patch does help BIG with the iStick vapor system. If in need "VAPE". Vape hard...Truly works.

Day 1= Easier
Day 2= Easy
Day 3= Extremely difficult
Day 4= Very difficult
Day 5= Difficult
Day 6= Hardest
Day 7= Realization 
Day 8= Freedom ( from smoking )

Still patched and using iStick that is a great tool that works! 

I loved smoking. I hated the cost!  


Good luck

I quit over the summer, so this is the first time I've really appreciated this benefit of not smoking.

With hurricane Joaquin working its way up the east coast, it has been cold, wet, and windy outside for the last three days, and I'm really loving the fact that I don't feel the need to go outside every few hours or drive with my windows down.

Five months today, some reflection

Life is better today than it was five months ago. I can breathe again, and I don't feel like a slave. I'm looking forward to a healthy life, and milady enjoys kissing me. 

To the smokers and would-be-smokers out there in r/stopsmoking: 

You smell awful, and you're lying to yourself every time you put a cigarette into your mouth when you know that you don't really want one. Quit while you're still sane enough to do so. Life is way better when you're not a smoker.  

How to quit smoking tobacco: 

* Grab your genitalia, check to make sure it's still there.

* Look at yourself in the mirror, deeply in the eyes, and remember that you're still alive. 

* Think about smoking. 

* Put them down.

* Don't buy or bum any tobacco. 

* Repeat every moment of every day for the rest of your life. 

* Rejoice!

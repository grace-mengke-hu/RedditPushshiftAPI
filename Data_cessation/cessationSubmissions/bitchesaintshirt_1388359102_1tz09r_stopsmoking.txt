I need advice for talking to my mom about her smoking...

My mom has smoked fairly heavily for many years. I've graduated and moved out, but I still come home for breaks and am normally home for 1-3 weeks at a time. The other day her and her friends smoked so much around me that it made me really sick. I've noticed that it makes my throat hurt and gives me headaches when people smoke around me. I also HATE smelling like cigarettes.

What can I do and what should I say? I can't make her quit, but I would like her to stop smoking in the house when I'm home at the very least. Any advice for how to talk about this? I'm worried she'll be mad at me for bringing it up and will think I'm being disrespectful. 

Also, sorry if this isn't the best subreddit for this I wasn't sure where else to ask...

Quick edit: I smoked for about three years and just quit at the beginning of last summer, so I understand how hard it is and I'm not blaming her for not being able to quit. I'm just not sure the best way to go about bringing the subject up without being rude and disrespectful.

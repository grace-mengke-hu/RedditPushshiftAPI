I smoked my last cigarette yesterday.

I just found this sub. Today I completed day 5 of Chantix. I smoked my last cig last night, and haven't bought anymore. I'm excited about becoming smoke free.
A pack is ~$6 where I live, and I was a pack a day smoker. As a reminder of how much money I've wasted, I've decided to put what I would've spent in a week on cigarettes (~$42) into my savings. This might seem trivial to some, but I think it's a good idea.

Needing to rant on my 13th day

It's been 13 days and within that 13 days from having 20 a day I've probably had close to 20 within the 13 days. I'm angry at myself. But when I'm in the zone I don't think about what I have and can accomplish. I've pin pointed triggers and thought it best to irraticate them until I have a handle to deal with them better. Areas of opportunity is work and my husband. Work stresses me out to high heaven and my husband keeps asking if I want to have a smoke. We never smoked indoors or in the car we always went outside so the temptation was never in these areas.

I did this for health reasons and because my dad died of heart decease but when I think about my dad I want a cigarette because I'm sad. One of the things I enjoyed doing was competitive dodgeball so I stopped because a lot of my fellow player smoke too. Problem with that is now I've "quit" both dodgeball regularly and smoking full time I feel like I'm not getting the exercise I need. I'm losing weight drastically and have already dropped 10Ibs and 2 inches. You may say wow that's awesome but it's not. All the crap I use to eat tastes disgusting. I went to see Logan on March 3rd and even the popcorn smelt putrid. Everything hurts all the aches and pains I endured in dodgeball is coming back to haunt me and when someone says something stupid at work I want to call them an idiot and scream. Funny thing is all those moments I would actually snap or swear up the yin yang hasn't come out yet. I feel actually calm. I know it doesn't sound like it at all and I know I'm rambling but I just wish it was easier. Sometimes I wonder if it's a craving that I'm addicted too or just the hand to mouth motions. It's just so frustrating.

Quitting today

So I decided I want to quit today. I've been smoking for almost ten years now and I've had enough. I no longer enjoy it, it's just something I do. I was buying groceries today and decided to buy a pack of Nicorette and see if it can help. I've had the electronic cigs and vapor pens but they just make it more convenient when I'm at home or inside where I can't smoke a real cigarette. I'm out of cigs and haven't bought another pack through some miracle of willpower. I'm a new subscriber and thought that it might help if I ask for some basic tips on what to do/avoid through the coming storm. My reasons for doing this are pretty simple, I want to be around for as long as I can for my wife and enjoy life as much as possible. Sorry for the shitpost and mini rant, I just thought that it would help to post something.

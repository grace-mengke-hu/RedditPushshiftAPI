How many of you are planning quitting on the 1st of January?

I know most of you feel like that you should quit any day of the year instead of the 1st of January, but i like quitting more with others who have the same withdrawals instead of others who have quit over a year. Of course i love your support but it feels more like a group if a bunch more are in the same position as me. Best of lucks guys!!

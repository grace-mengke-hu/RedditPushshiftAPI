How to fix smokers skin?

I know the first part is quitting, but is there ways to fix the skin without expensive methods?  I read about intaking more vit A and C and even trying aloe drinks and applying to the skin.  Its just discouraging to have to wait for results.  How long does it take or is this permanent damage?  20 year off and on heavy smoker.

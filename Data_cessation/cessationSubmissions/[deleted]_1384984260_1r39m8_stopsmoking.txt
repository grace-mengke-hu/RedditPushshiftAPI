I'm freaking out.

So it's been pretty much 3 weeks now, and I feel awesome physically; not even craving cigarettes. I feel pretty much free, except for one thing:

I'm really really angry, all the time. I'm usually quite a chilled out person, yet the past 3 weeks, I've just become so angry. I mean it gets to the point where I have to scream into a pillow over something as stupid as someone leaving a window open.

I've posted here before about this, and people said it would just go away, but if I'm honest, it's getting worse. Is this really because of stopping smoking? I mean it didn't happen until then.

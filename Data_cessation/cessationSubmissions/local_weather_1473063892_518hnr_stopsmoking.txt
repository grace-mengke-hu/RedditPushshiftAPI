Been off nicotine since March but I need some advice

I haven't smoked in years but I was vaping and/or on snus.  I put everything down in March and I've been completely nicotine free but for the past week or so I have been severely craving nicotine.  I don't know what triggered it but if anyone has any suggestions I would appreciate it.

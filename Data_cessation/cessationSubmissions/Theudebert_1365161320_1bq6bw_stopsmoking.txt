Day 2, feeling better . . .

Hey guys, I just wanted to thank you for all the support yesterday as I was going through hell.  I got things more or less settled with my girlfriend, and I've gotten the process started for getting help with my alcoholism.  I have a lot of life changes I need to make, and smoking is just one of them.  However, since I can't stand the AA people in the alcoholism subreddits, I think I'm just going to vent and record my progress here as I deal with both of these addictions, if you guys don't mind.  

I feel like I'm finally on the verge of really changing something for the better, once and for all.  Thanks again for your support, and godspeed in your own recoveries from addiction.

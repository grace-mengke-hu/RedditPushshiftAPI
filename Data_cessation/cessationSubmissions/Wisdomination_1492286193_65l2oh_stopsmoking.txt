How I stopped - probably a somewhat anomalous tale.

Hi future non-smokers,

It’s been 10 years since I quit smoking overnight, so thought I’d share the story. It is not a tip or a tool, more like "better hope this doesn’t happen to you". 

I went to a dentist for a routine checkup, and she looks into my mouth and says "do you smoke, sir?". I’m like "yeah, a bit". "Well, there are some fairly tell-tale changes on your mucous membranes. If you don’t stop, you’ll develop cancer within half a year."

Cold. Turkey. 

(Membranes fine, by the way)

Don’t let that happen to you. Quit sooner.

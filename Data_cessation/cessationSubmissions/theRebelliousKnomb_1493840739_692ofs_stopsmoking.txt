1 Month Smoke free

I woke up today on the wrong side of the bed. Walked to work and allergies kicked in (something new to me) and I just couldn't shake negative thought patterns. 

This has nothing to do with quitting smoking, there are other things in my life affecting my self-esteem of late. 

So while I was at work I got a craving (there easy to shake off by now.) And then it dawned on me that today is a month free of smoke. Lets just say my morale has shifted and I'm seeing things more positively right now.

1 month free and many more months to come.

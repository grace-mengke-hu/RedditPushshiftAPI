i am so high strung when i'm not smoking, have to keep moving. anybody else?

it's been about a month since i've bought a pack, maybe bummed 3 ciggies in that time. my longest since i started 10 years ago. problem is, i can't relax. my muscles are always tingling, itching to go go go. i have almost zero appetite ffs, can barely sleep and i'm stretching constantly and working out multiple times a day. things are good - my house is so clean and life is way more in order, but fuuuuuuuuuck i just want to chill. 

does anyone else have experience with this? i had the same issue last summer when i was off the cigs for 3 weeks. thanks in advance.
